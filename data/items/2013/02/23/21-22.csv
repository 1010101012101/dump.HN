5271674,comment,5270479,5270479,8,0,MichaelGG,,,"Wow, what a fantastic set of articles. Some interesting things for me:<p>- Apparently low/middle class consumers in Japan would put themselves into debt to buy luxury brands like Gucci. I'm not sure if this is meant general debt like we see in the US with credit cards, or if it mean specific financing for those items. (I met a guy in Central America that was making payments on a jean jacket.)<p>- If I read correctly, the lower income pressure is making things that are marginally cheaper, like fake beer, actually take off. I would assume this is because of the generally high cost of products in Japan? Whereas in other countries, even with lower income, you don't resort to fake beer... maybe I misunderstood though.<p>- As of the article's time, the Internet doesn't have any really influential outlets in Japan, and print media dominates for legitimacy and doesn't put much content online. I know myself and other folks that don't read any print media, so it seems odd that the Internet didn't penetrate quickly in Japan.<p>- The squeeze on the markets means fringe groups now ""dominate"". That is, ""normal"" folks cut back on their consumption, but fringe groups are defined by such consumption. So the normal purchasing is gone, leaving just the fringe, leading to groups like AKB48 being #1, when in reality they have niche appeal.<p>It closes pointing out that this fringe popularity taking over means Japan's cultural exports are growing weaker, and like technology, might be disrupted by Korea. Since the article was written, I think SNSD has grown in popularity, and Gangnam Style certainly brought K-pop into the highlight.<p>It'll be interesting to see if Korea can successfully export other cultural stuff that Japan has done well with, like video games and anime. (From my brief and irrelevant exposure, it seems Korea is very insular and does not do well exporting culture, although the kpop thing might be changing that. For example, all Korean sites seem to require you to login with your Korean national ID.)",1361656378

5271667,comment,5270479,5271496,11,0,mc32,,,"Yes and no.<p>On the surface Japan can seem like it has some things in common (comparable) with the West; however, it's more or less comparing superficial manifestations.<p>1.  Japan while you will see 'international' this and that everywhere and people are taught English from an early age, Japan is very insular (geographically, obviously and mentally) and inward looking (provincial not reflective) and hardly international.  People (employees) in the international depts can't expect to rise much within an org. --with few exceptions).  All talk and no walk.<p>2.  Japan is very xenophobic (not just a little like Italy might be or France might be about undocumented Roma or Albanians).  This could be traced back to how Japan dealt with foreigners (and trade) back in the Edo period as exemplified by Dejima island.  Foreigners (dutch) were relegated to an island and had to be back by sundown and could not leave.  This attitude has not changed in over a hundred years.  3rd generation Koreans are still considered foreigners (and they must assume a Japanese name, and oddly none the less considered foreign).  The foreign population in Japan is actually on the wane for various reasons (economic and also people just get tired of the politics)<p>3. Japanese industry found their stride in the late 60s; however, few have revisited their assumptions, systems, technologies, methods, etc.  For an example, look at their film industry.  Almost complete implosion due to stagnation.<p>4. Conformity.  While on the surface these niche 'diverse' groups would seem to indicate break with conformity, it does not.  As someone observed, these movements and subcultures are de-coupled from politics, completely.<p>That's just the beginning.  There are many other reasons a 1:1 comparison with the West is not helpful.<p>There is a kind of parallel withe the US.  It's the maturity regression.  However, while many in the US recognize and decry the eternal adolescence of American adults (viz toilet humor, frat culture), in Japan it's rather infantilization (viz Hello Kitty, stuffed animals, Pokemon --whose main audience are adults, not children).<p>Edit:  I guess what I mean is that one would extrapolate Japan onto the West at one's own expense (of understanding).  In this agree with Japan --they are unique, in this regard.",1361656238

5271647,comment,5271225,5271225,3,0,networked,,,"If starting with x86 assembly seems overwhelming to you there are a few alternatives that might help.<p>First are virtual machines that were developed to be programmed directly in a kind of assembly language. CHIP-8 [1] is a good example of one of those, being a VM standard developed to make games run across a broad range of otherwise incompatible mid-1970s hardware. It gained a new popularity in the early 2000s and as a result you can now find CHIP-8 emulators for virtually any platform, including your mobile phone, as well as a range of assemblers and other development tools. It's a fascinating bit of history in its own right and also a great platform to emulate in the first emulator you write. A bit further away from the syntax of ""real"" assemblers is Linoleum [2], which is meant to be a kind of a cross-platform assembly language targeted towards graphics applications, but the principles behind programming in it are largely the same. I can recommend both from personal experience, although CHIP-8 is probably a better starting point.<p>Second, if you want something closer to real hardware I'd suggest learning how to program for the MOS 6502, the CPU used in the Apple II and (with some modifications) in the Commodore 64 and the NES gaming console. One way to get started with it is Easy6502 [3], which is an online introductory course on 6502 programming bundled with an in-browser emulator.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleum_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleum_%28programming_langua...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://skilldrick.github.com/easy6502/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skilldrick.github.com/easy6502/</a>",1361655888

Granted, you don't have to take care of register allocation yourselves, and the instructions are slightly more abstract (an abstraction which is inevitably leaky), but it does really drive home the differences between registers and memory, how pointers and addressing are used at the lower level, that there are different calling conventions (but you don't have to learn the niggly little details for each), it's portable, etc.<p>Anyone who has used both more extensively who can comment?",1361655883

5271637,comment,5271225,5271225,16,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I don't think programming in assembly language for modern architectures (x86-64 as implemented by the latest Intel/AMD chips) will ever be as fun as doing so for microcontrollers or embedded devices, because it's almost impossible to keep all of their inner workings in your head.<p>A 6502 is a really stupidly simple machine. If you've had previous exposure to programming in assembly, you can get a pretty complete understanding of the machine in an afternoon. It doesn't take very much experience to get to the point where you can take a look at a subroutine and figure out exactly how many cycles it will take to execute, on which exact cycle this I/O operation will occur, etc.<p>I've tried that approach with x86 (not even x86-64!) manuals before, and I ran away screaming. I don't know how long it would take me just to be aware of all of those instructions, let alone be able to even roughly estimate their execution time across the hundreds of differing x86(-64) implementations! Just peeking at Agner Fog's optimization manuals[1], I remember that some instructions can take 20~ cycles on a Pentium 4 (probably the oldest x86 processor still in common public use), and 1~2 cycles on anything past the Core series. Some instructions an Intel Atom will choke to death upon. With some similar pairs of instructions, one of the two is faster on every machine <i>except</i> the Atoms! How am I supposed to reconcile all of these discrepancies and write something that is anywhere near optimal for a large portion of the x86 userbase?<p>You can make the argument that you don't need to know all of the x86 instructions to write a decent assembly language program. That's probably true. Yet, part of the fun of working on a simpler system is that you can write a piece of code and know that it is very close to optimal -- maybe you could rewrite the whole thing and save a few bytes or a few cycles, but you still feel like you've put your repertoire of tricks to good use and made something that you would be feel reasonably comfortable showing off to the experts. If I can't get that feeling on x86, only getting to beat a compiler that has to work within the limitations of its language, and producing a result where no one really cares (and can't even tell!) that I shaved a few cycles here and there, there is little point, and not as much fun.<p>If you want to have fun writing assembly language, pick a processor microarchitecture that you can comfortably fit in your head, and an environment where you'll only have to deal with one or two implementations of that microarchitecture. Intel and AMD, in the (very well justified) interest of developing the most powerful machines on the market, have turned x86 into something that is not fun to write assembly for, and not possible to fit in your head (at least, without serious commitment on the level of ""I am going to make a career out being the x86 guy/gal""). Don't bother! Don't even bother writing something for a platform where you need libraries to print something to the screen, or convert a line of text into a number. Find a platform that lets you turn lights on and off by poking addresses, and go from there.<p>In the mean time, I'm not at all surprised that no one tries to write optimal software for x86 PCs. No user will feel the effort you put into shaving cycles off of anything but the tightest loops and most critical of paths, and there isn't even a scene of ``expert programmers'' comparable to the ones currently around the 6502 or 68000 to appreciate what you do. The best you get is a mention on Hacker News and a few wistful comments about the good ol' days.<p></stupid rant><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/</a><p>Lots of very useful information here, even if you don't ever want to attempt programming in x86 assembly.<p>EDIT: The funny thing about all this is that even ``back in the day,'' a 6502 was fast enough that you could get away with all kinds of inefficiencies. You find a game that blew your mind as a kid and stuff it into a debugging emulator, trying to understand bits and pieces of how the engine works, and find yourself laughing at trivial inefficiencies all over the place, even in critical loops! Yet, even with all the hundreds or thousands of bytes and cycles wasted here and there, then end result still feels plenty ``fast.''",1361655605

It was very expensive, I presume it came to him through an organisation that helps blind people (he did say, but I've forgotten those details), and he showed me it's special assistive features claiming (with humour) the he would be willing to bet mine couldn't do that.<p>I flipped out my iPhone (4 at the time I think) switched on the assistive settings (which I'd not done before) and handed it over to him. He had it figured out almost instantly. What blew him away was that the price of this fancy new phone brand new was still significantly cheaper than the phones available through his normal channels - and it was his opinion (after an admittedly short time with the phone) that this was more useful and easier to use than his current phone.<p>Accessibility is something I think is probably (note I said probably, I have no evidence either way) overlooked by most the startups around here - but I think Apple are trailblazing here too.

Then step back and let the person in charge make the decision.<p>My rule of thumb is two 'No' answers. It goes like this:<p>Present affirmative reasons why direction X is the right choice. Try to focus on the benefits of X rather than pointing out the flaws in the current plan. If the response is no, I'll try to address any concerns regarding X. If the response is still no I leave it alone.<p>I've found that if you continue past this point it becomes an argument. Now you're challenging the groups ability to proceed after making a decision. Once that occurs your opinions are an impediment to the groups progress.<p>Note: Perspective is worth 80 IQ points. The team could be basing the decision on factors you aren't aware of. The world is seldom simple enough to present one 'best' answer to a given situation.<p>EDIT: No they aren't ""all against you because you're so much smarter than them"". Seeing this sentiment in some of the comments. Trust me this doesn't happen. For every one real instance of this, there are 100 instances of condescending engineer who is just parroting the technology fad of the day.

5271486,comment,5271001,5271001,5,0,hakaaaaak,,,"Any modern operating system that allows open development fits the bill. I think what the OP is saying is that he would settle for having it run on top of Linux, but I'd bet that he wants the core written as (or even interpreted by) a Python interpreter, so that everything from drivers to applications could be written in Python. Wouldn't we all?<p>I've been wanting the same for Ruby, which I think is superior to Python in its syntax, clarity, and readability. I'd settle for a Ruby interpreter in every browser.<p>However, first, I'd like to see Firefox OS succeed. The idea behind it is better: take the most well-used web development language (client-side) and make it also the same language for writing applications (client-side). The only things missing are being able to write lower-level drivers using Javascript (not just having to hack atop Android) and for all of the server (not just Node) to be Javascript.<p>There is a reason that what is usually used to write OS's is basically C (or some variation), though. C is an intelligible and useful language that can be portable across architectures. C, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Java, etc. are all very similar when compared with assembly or machine code. C has the advantage of allowing more flexibility in memory management. So, I just don't see Python as an language used to develop an OS.<p>As for whether it makes sense to develop the appearance of everything being in Python so that kids can hack it up: you'd be better off introducing them to Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, the Arduino and have them participate in Science Olympiads. There is no modern equivalent of what we grew up with.",1361653299

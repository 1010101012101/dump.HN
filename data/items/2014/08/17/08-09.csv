Read the link I gave you above.<p>One of the biggest secret weapons of homeschoolers and unschoolers is <i>age-mixing</i>. Standard schools artificially segregate kids by age and force them to learn in a specific order. This guarantees that no kid in the room knows much more than the other kids. In the real world, on just about any subject at all you can find people who know a little more than you and learn from them or find people who know a bit less and teach them. Kids teach EACH OTHER how to do cool stuff like use a computer or mod a video game.<p>The hardest and most important thing to figure out in life is &quot;what do I want to learn and how can I learn it?&quot; When schools decide on a specific curriculum and spoon-feed it to kids, they destroy the intrinsic motivation to solve that question for yourself; you can just passively accept what is being force-fed to you by your teachers.

Here&#x27;s a Cliffs Notes abbreviated version, just listing what the seven lessons are:<p><a href=""http://www.athenstalks.com/node/179729"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.athenstalks.com/node/179729</a><p>And here&#x27;s the whole essay (which is still pretty short):<p><a href=""http://www.worldtrans.org/whole/schoolteacher.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldtrans.org/whole/schoolteacher.txt</a><p>Of the &quot;seven lessons&quot;, I think the lesson of the bells was the one I found most damaging. When I get interested in a subject, I would want to study that subject deeply, intensely, to the exclusion of everything else. Having to learn a subject like math divided into TINY LITTLE CHUNKS, mere drips and drabs spread out over an entire YEAR, takes something that could have interesting and makes it infuriating. Being expected to turn your interest on and off like a light switch when bells ring at arbitrary intervals...just didn&#x27;t work for me.<p>I&#x27;m sure it depends on the student. Kids are resilient; I think most manage to learn a fair bit <i>despite</i> their schooling and some learn a bit <i>due to</i> it. For myself, I&#x27;m pretty sure school damaged my intrinsic motivation and wasted my time; I feel like I learned much more <i>despite</i> school than <i>due to</i> it.",1408262715

If ordinary then maybe things have changed in the 15 years since I was in high school.<p>And if you&#x27;re responsible for your own major bills and expenses like housing, food, clothes and transportation then even more kudos to you. I&#x27;d be extremely surprised if that was the typical situation of an average 16 yo American.",1408262684

October was when the law was passed, which was backdated to September 1st.<p>This isn&#x27;t just to be pedantic, I&#x27;m currently reading The Third Reich trilogy by Richard J. Evans, and this is an instance of the Nazi emphasis on appearing as though they had a legal basis for their actions, even well into the dictatorship. It&#x27;s one of the most bizarre parts of the story to me.<p>The euthanasia was attempted to be done in secret, so under what circumstance the backdating (or even the existence) of the law could possibly have been useful is beyond me. Under Nazi victory, those involved were safe from prosecution, and in case of defeat, the law could not have saved them.<p>It&#x27;s like something straight out of the movie Brazil, though not being fiction and having resulted in the death and suffering of countless real people makes not possible to enjoy the insanity of the situation.<p>I highly recommend the books, though I don&#x27;t exactly have a weak stomach, and many parts were quite difficult for me. It reminded me quite a bit of Robert Fisk&#x27;s The Great War for Civilisation, which was also extremely long and dense with suffering.",1408262505

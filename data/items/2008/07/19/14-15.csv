250664,comment,249898,250227,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>I disagree - Apple was pushing the entire idea of a Personal Computer before that market existed.</i><p>Okay, time to channel Grandpa Simpson! Where's my cane?<p><grandpa><p>Now, sonny, what people forget is that Apple Computer brought their Apple II to an <i>existing market</i> for home PCs. [1] The first home PC had been introduced in January 1975, and by 1977 when the Apple II came out there were already multiple PC enthusiast magazines, Microsoft had been in the software business for two years, and there were multiple companies selling PC hardware. The Apple II was introduced <i>at a personal computer show</i>.<p>Even the Apple I was an entry into an existing market.<p>Jobs and Wozniak certainly pushed the envelope: The Apple II was, for example, arguably the first PC to be marketed at folks who didn't know how to solder, who didn't even <i>care about hardware</i> but just wanted to buy or write software and run it. But the hardware hackers drooled over it too [2], and they bought it, and thus the venture was less risky that you think -- it didn't have to create its own market, because Jobs knew the core market was already there; the challenge was to <i>grow</i> the market.<p>Pioneering the PC market was the work of the Altair guys at MITS, two years prior. MITS, of course, followed the usual good advice for people who are trying to discover a brand-new market: They launched early to test the market. They launched <i>really</i> early. As in ""before they actually <i>built</i> more than a single prototype, they photographed a mockup and sent that photo plus the schematic to the editor of <i>Popular Electronics</i> [3], who read the schematic, concluded that the hardware was probably real, and published an article on it that drove hundreds and hundreds of mail orders in a few weeks."" Then the company used the money from the mail orders to actually buy the parts, package the kits and send them out. [4]<p>You could even argue that <i>MITS</i> was targeting an existing market: If the folks writing <i>Popular Electronics</i> hadn't built a fan base that was ready and waiting to solder together computers, the PC revolution wouldn't have caught fire in 1975.<p></grandpa><p>All of this is cribbed from Steven Levy's <i>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</i>, a book you should really read.<p>[1] Note: Here ""PC"" has its original meaning of ""generic personal computer"" and does not refer to MS/DOS compatible boxen. Those came later, obviously.<p>[2] It helped that the Apple II not only came with schematics and a complete listing of its ROM, but had been designed by a hardware-hacking genius of the first water who liked to show off.<p>[3] MITS also mailed their single prototype to <i>Popular Electronics</i>. It got lost in the mail and was never seen again. If you find it, contact some historians.<p>[4] If you think you intend to follow this business plan, make sure your lawyer is sitting down before you broach the subject.",1216478823

250662,comment,250232,250321,0,0,swombat,,,"Be too selective and you won't hire anyone good either. Great people are often eccentric, with weird personality kinks that can make them harder to work with. In my experience, smart, creative, brilliant people are pretty much always harder to work with, opinionated, pushy, and demanding. But I'll take that over ""average but does what he's told"" any day.",1216478190
250661,comment,250580,250580,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Learn more about how to select ideas. Not only is this a good thing to do, it will help you out once you get started on something. Seriously. You should be able to take a list of twelve ideas and take both sides of the do/don't do argument. What's the market size? What's market entry like? How close can you get to the customer? Are you selling information or entertainment? (It's all info, yes, but people buy some apps based on unique data, some on the way it makes them feel) What's your team-forming potential? Is this something that just sounds good on a napkin, or when it is implemented is there really core value for the consumer there? etc.<p>There are lots more questions. You don't have to score high on all of these to have a winner, but you DO need to intimately know the reasons why your idea might suck before you take it up. You can't overcome weaknesses you don't understand that you have. And BTW, I would rank ""How close are you to the customer"" and ""how big is the market size"" pretty close to the top of the list. This is why, for instance, we see college kids writing apps that other college kids pick up and play with -- a huge market that they are very close to.<p>I've found that enthusiasm/passion can come after you analyze the heck out of a project just as easily as it can come randomly speculating about good business ideas. In fact, an idea that you've tried and tried to kill but couldn't? Combine that with some good old hard work and a skeptical eye and you'll be a million times more enthusiastic than somebody with no skin in the game.",1216477952

I think if it was possible for a startup to start making and selling those sweetcorn peelers there and make a profit, somebody would have done so ages ago. Same for the mills: if there was a proper market and competition, the mill makers would have fixed their mills a long time ago.",1216477821

It's the perfect language for classes which don't actually teach you how to program, but instead just teach you how to be a code monkey.<p>As andreyf said, if you're serious, high school may not teach you much, or so says my own experience. I am only in tenth grade right now, but by my estimation I probably already know the whole CS curriculum at my school (although supposedly it is advanced). I suppose this is actually a very good thing, because I've learned how to learn on my own.<p>I'm sort of in the same boat as you. What I've noticed though, is that many (if not most) of the students don't really want to learn CS, they just want to take the course. Sad but true.",1216477041

Interesting in that the pitch relationships of individual notes seems a lot clearer, but frustrating because the visualization is so limited. I don't think that the frustrating aspects of it are indicative of a failure on the part of the author, but because even our somewhat confusing and complex system of notation ultimately conveys so much more information about the relationships of the fundamental harmonic building blocks that form the basis of pieces like this. In this visualization, that information is almost nonexistent.<p>My first thought is to ask a question of those who aren't fluent in the language of written music: does this help you ""understand"" the music better? As a performer (I teach piano as one of my many occupations), I'm constantly trying to simplify my ability to quickly read and understand the music I'm playing, and that inevitably involves seeing chords, not notes.<p>So: do you think this helps you?

What I'll see is a discussion about whether piracy really hurts anyone with people arguing that it's free marketing and people who pirate wouldn't buy anyway.

Then one guy comes along saying that software companies aren't evil and developers should be able to charge for their work and piracy is bad.

It is difficult to hold the residents who voted fully accountable - they can not be clairvoyant and predict who is or is not corrupt.<p>Another difference is that governments exist to serve the peoples' interest at all levels, if one level is dysfunctional it does not seem to give all other levels the freedom to ignore it.

Compare to the new hotness ""Stripe"" which attempts to offer an IPN lookalike, but theirs doesn't actually work since it doesn't re-notify if your endpoint is down/broken. PayPal's does.<p>> If you live in the USA there's no excuse for using Paypal<p>I'll give you a few excuses:<p>* 232 million registered accounts<p>* Brand recognition and trust your site doesn't have yet<p>* The only way for most US small businesses to accept the preferred payment method of many countries where credit cards are not the norm<p>* Lower transaction fees than almost any merchant account and 3rd party payment provider, with no required monthly fees<p>* Sophisticated fraud detection for free<p>* 100% immunity from fraudulent payments for shipped goods for registered buyers<p>If you're going to suggest someone else not use PayPal, at least give them a truthful reason.<p>> I found fastspring<p>Which charges 5.9%-8.9% instead of 1.9%-2.9% and pays you twice a month instead of daily (PayPal Auto Sweep) or whenever you want... among all the possible alternatives to PayPal, that's one of the worst I've seen. Even if this company assigns you a personal account manager who sits at a desk all day just waiting to take your calls, it's irrational to give up 6% of your profit margin to use them. Some businesses don't even <i>have</i> a 6% profit margin, handing 5.9% of every payment to the processor (that's only giving 1-2% to the card network) would simply put them out of business.",1323916174

It would be interesting to know how many will actually make it through the screening, phone/on-site interviews and get a job offer.<p>Second, I registered for the Machine Learning course (I am not sure if the same applies to the AI course) and I compared it with the actual ML course at Stanford (CS229) (I mainly looked at Youtube videos of Andrew[1] as well as Assignments/Midterm[2]). The latter is by far more advanced and theoretical. The assignments tend to test more than basic comprehension of the material presented in the lectures, which is exactly what the online course reviews tend to evaluate.

I will preface this by saying I like the concept, and the implementation is clean.  Congratulations on your launch - it's nice to see new ideas entering the industry.<p>First, you should be aware that launch traffic is demographically <i>nothing</i> like customer traffic.  If your site has been posted to tech blogs, startup blogs, tweeted amongst your tech friends, etc, then most of that launch traffic is of the ""I'm just checking out this cool new site"" variety.  This does not convert nearly as well as the ""I really need to schedule a gift for my wife"" variety.  Expect your blog links to pay off over time in SEO linkjuice value, not in the one-week short run.<p>Second, you picked a bad time to launch a gift <i>scheduling</i> service.  Well over half of your potential customers have <i>already purchased</i> the items in their gift list.  And for those that haven't, they will most assuredly be going to companies with longer-running reputations that they can trust to fulfill delivery timeframes.  Expect October of next year to be significantly better.<p>Third, the UI is probably not intuitive to people accustomed to traditional ecommerce sites.  Aunt Millie is probably not going to realize that clicking on the barely-visible arrow icon on the left/right margins will display another product.  One unfortunate fact about ecommerce, and one that is likely the driving force behind stagnation in design evolution, is that catering to <i>expectations</i> is usually more valuable to conversions than catering to coolness.  I say usually because there are a few exceptions to this rule( think Apple ), with heavy emphasis on <i>a few</i>.<p>Fourth, impatience.  Seriously, it's been a week.  It takes time to get to know your customers.

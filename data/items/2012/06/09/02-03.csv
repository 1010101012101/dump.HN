Could you contrast these steps with how you believe people <i>should</i> be fired?<p><i>Summary: Cover your ass.</i><p>Certainly doing the right thing is one way to cover your ass.<p><i>Step 1: Have a gigantic book of employee guidelines. At any point in time, you should be able to pick an employee and find something you can write them up for. Have the employee sign a piece of paper on day 1 that they are aware of the book.</i><p>Are you saying it's better not to have clear employee guidelines or not to make sure they know them?<p><i>Step 2: Before you fire the employee, make sure you've written him up more than once. Lay your groundwork a week or two in advance. Find something else, and do the paperwork from step one. You don't fire an employee for walking in on the VP banging a secretary, it's because he wasn't filing his TPS reports properly.</i><p>Are you saying it's better not to wait for repeat offenses, or better not to have clear reasons for firing?<p>I have no idea where you got this ""VP banging a secretary"" interpretation. He's talking about his furniture company of 6 carpenters, for goodness sake.<p><i>Step 3: When actually firing somebody, have a witness + a recording device in the room. This protects you from sexual harassment lawsuits.</i><p>It only protects you from sexual harassment lawsuits if you don't sexually harass them. It also only protects you from any other kind of lawsuit for wrongful behavior if you don't behave wrongfully. Isn't it a good thing for them to not sexually harass employees?<p><i>Step 4: Explanations: Blame the economy. If that doesn't work, blame the phases of the moon. Anything you want, but not something that is grounds for a wrongful termination suit.</i><p>Is it better to have no reason, or not to explain to the employee that there were external factors in the decision, or to lie that there were no external factors? Or are you saying external factors never dominate and blaming them is always lying?<p>Of course you shouldn't fire some one for reasons that would be grounds for a wrongful termination suit. Because those would be wrongful terminations!<p>You seem to be narrowly interpreting his attempts to do the right thing as just attempting to cover his ass. I don't see  where you got this, he repeatedly agonizes over doing firing the right way. Could you explain what you think he'd do differently if he were actually a good boss, as opposed to just trying to cover his ass?",1339209317

A game is not a web application.  A game has a claim to require mutability for performance concerns, but mutable state is generally safer in such a use case. A game is likely to have a few threads, each with a dedicated task or set of tasks, whereas a web application is not so constrained and any request may effectively duplicate another.

4086955,comment,4086251,4086251,6,0,jmspring,,,"My biggest problem with the whole entrepreneurial Visa mess is that it gets lumped in with other Visa categories as well.  Even the definition of Startup 2.0 crosses a line for me.<p>I believe, if someone has the the capital (or guarantee of capital) backing for starting a company and they want to do so in the US, the process should be very simple (beyond requisite background checks, etc).  If you want to build, please come.<p>Visas for ""higher education"", I would willingly grant extended stay Visas for those completing PhDs but would put a slightly higher barrier on those getting Masters.  Why?  Two-fold (the second I will address below).  My biggest issue is, especially here in California (for what I know), the UC system is hurting and embracing out of state (and out of country) applicants for the added tuition.  And, for CS related degrees a Masters really generally just a one year degree.  I would like to see more than just the one-year degree before granting an extended visa more easily than the existing visa paths.<p>My second problem with granting Visas to Master's students and this applies in general to my problem with visas for technical jobs, is the currently large unemployed base.  My problem is not with those wishing to come here and contribute, but with the system itself.  And, on some level, I am complicit in this.<p>The US has a very large un/underemployed base, even within tech.  Companies argue that they can't hire enough qualified people, but the reality in a lot of cases is either: 1) the companies aren't willing to pay for the qualifications (the controversial path); or 2) companies aren't willing to train to fill in a potentially qualified candidate's gaps.<p>There are people out there that would be decent DevOps, SysAdmins, or even developers...but when a company posts for a position, they want the closest fit to that position.  If someone might be an Ok fit over time, but would require investment in terms of training and time, the company will bypass them (in most cases).<p>For me, there is this gaping hole that this country needs to address -- we need to provide the ability to retool those seeking jobs to better fit current openings.  The US and it's approach to ""private enterprise"" sucks at this.  I know people that have gone to these fly by night ""learn new skills"" areas only to end up more in debt, still un/underemployed and not contributing to society as well as they might.  Even in the case where people <i>are</i> trying (and not giving up).<p>I am probably rambling here, but I think Startup 2.0 is a step in the right direction, but I wish the US would do more to encourage the development and reeducation of local talent.  Our current system of falling into the cracks or mortgaging ourselves further to sketchy private ""learn X"" institutions is doing us no good.",1339208213

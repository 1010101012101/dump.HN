So far, no change in my diabetes but I am still losing a couple of pounds every month.  If you are right, I will be cured by next year.<p>I say this in all honesty.  If losing weight cures it I will be so thankful.  The strange thing is that I have never been one to eat lots of sweets and I exercise.  Many people who weigh much more than me have way better blood sugar.  So is it all weight or is there something more?  Personally, I wonder about environmental factors.  Also now they are finding some medicines are linked to diabetes.  Like Seroquel (which I took years ago) and Lipitor.",1443931185

At that point, synthesizers were largely associated with millionaires noodling away in expensive studios and not part of the equation for a bunch of teenagers starting a band. The minute these bands started doing albums and synths started getting mass produced by Japanese firms, they began to pop up in the music from about 1978, just a year after the first crop of UK punk albums.",1443931123

Comparatively, rust is a behemoth in terms of complexity.<p>There&#x27;s the completely relevant compilation speed difference: if rust could compile within 5-10x the time go does, it would be much more pleasant to work with. Being able to compile within 2 seconds on large projects is crazy for iteration speed; having to wait upwards of 10 seconds on toy projects is not.<p>However, rust is stupid fast while also being safer than go. Also, generics; that&#x27;s a flamewar for another day.<p>Context: I&#x27;ve been working with go for around 2-3 years now. I recently decided to pick up rust because of the guarantees it provides along with the crazy performance.",1443931071

I&#x27;ve used and programmed an Alto, back when Stanford had a few around. It was basically a reworked Data General minicomputer in a small rackmount case. 16 bit word oriented, programmable in BCPL or Mesa at the low level, Smalltalk at the higher level.  The removable hard disk was the same as a DEC RK05 cartridge disk.  The Ethernet interface was very simple, and coax Ethernet was electrically simple. Alan Kay referred to Ethernet as &quot;an Alohanet with a captive ether&quot;. The CPU was microcoded, and cycles were stolen from the CPU&#x27;s microcode engine to run the peripherals.  None of this was pushing the state of the art.  The CPU hardware was a minimum viable product.<p>The keyboard, mouse, and display were all new, and nicely engineered. Most of the hardware effort went into those.  The keyboard had nice key switches and a massive metal casting. The display was the first good black-on-white display, with a big portrait-format screen.

I know she has long had a web presence, so it&#x27;s not that <i>she&#x27;s</i> lazy (although this post is on tumblr? sigh...). Presumably being a writer/blogger/etc, there is a huge audience of people who will &quot;follow&quot; her since it&#x27;s already in their &quot;workflow&quot;, yet won&#x27;t expend the effort to check a proper blog or learn about RSS.<p>But what she needs to do instead of crying, or perhaps after crying, is to <i>get angry</i>. Productively angry. This is <i>the state</i> of established webcrapps in 2015. This has been the <i>inevitable</i> result ever since &quot;web 2.0&quot; became a thing. This is why concerned hackers have been telling people to avoid webcrapps <i>the whole time</i>. Of course, many others sold their morals in lieu of money and social acceptance - it&#x27;s so easy to use, even your parents can opt in to extra surveillance!<p>The tide is starting to turn as more and more people realize what they&#x27;re actually giving up by living under the yoke of proprietary software 2.0. And it is going to take people who are &quot;in it&quot; to reverse the trend. Assuming she is willing to start putting in more effort, how exactly can she replace all these &quot;convenient&quot; sharecropper &quot;apps&quot; she&#x27;s gotten used to with self-administered technology that preserves her autonomy - while still engaging the lazy people who haven&#x27;t learned how to use a personal computer, and even <i>encouraging</i> them to make the jump to the free world?<p>One possible solution that comes to mind is publishing authoritatively on one&#x27;s own platform, then syndicating to facebook/tumblr/whatever. Perhaps delayed by hours/days so that it&#x27;s clear that the walled gardens are second class citizens. Make Facebook want your content more than you need them - similar to how unknown AOL keywords just redirected to .com.<p>For text this actually seems pretty straightforward. Other types of media (mobile pictures etc) are going to be harder because thorough development and advertising take money, and investors (especially VC) obviously aren&#x27;t looking to fund anything that isn&#x27;t a trap ready to be monetized.

Continuous monitoring and pump to try to keep the glucose levels very even - the way they are for a non-diabetic.<p>Also some people try to keep glucose levels somewhat lower than recommended under the assumption that the spikes cause harm, so starting with a lower baseline is better.

I do not believe normal human beings can operate under a mental framework that does not explicitly say &quot;all humans are objectively equal&quot;.

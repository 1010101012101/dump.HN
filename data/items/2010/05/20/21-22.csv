My children have both been immunised for the standard spread of common [childhood] disease in my country using the established vaccines. The swine flu vaccine was offered to us the week before vaccination was stopped - the reports were already in that it had been vastly overstocked, that vaccination wouldn't be effective against next seasons mutations, that other countries had ceased immunisation, that there were barely any new cases being reported, that it was far less virulent than expected and in addition I had a strong suspicion that our youngest (the only one offered the vaccine) had actually had the virus already. FWIW I've also donated to charities that make medical interventions such as vaccination of children.<p>Uninformed? I've attempted to ascertain the risks involved in the vaccines offered to us.

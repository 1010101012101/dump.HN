580055,comment,578981,580034,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think the discussion bifurcates here between two camps: the <i>pragmatic</i> camp, which describes the best way to reach various goals, and the <i>principles</i> camp, which describe reality (as they see it) whether or not goals are reached or not.<p>Both prongs of this discussion have serious flaws. If you try to act only pragmatically (convincing your fellow citizen that a little chaos is necessary for the growth of the larger state) then progress, or the state of the argument, is completely dependent on your powers of persuasion and the current fight/mindset of your fellow citizen. That fails over time because <i>creating limits are discussed at a much higher ratio than reducing them</i>. I'd have to have a persuasive power of about 100:1 in order just to maintain the status quo.<p>If, as I do, you believe there are some fundamental biological principles at play, then it really doesn't matter anyway. Either the principles are being respected or they are not. And sadly yes, I think it probably comes down to some sort of happy mathematical ratio. However, as you point out, arguing on principles in a society that is fear and risk-obsessed is a non-starter. And it's a really difficult argument to make that, while ten million people may blow smoke in other people's face, the loss of their freedom to move and act naturally is a greater loss than the hundred million who are annoyed with second-hand smoke (I am not a smoker, btw).

I don't have time to tell you the full story, but here's a fuller outline.<p>I assume you know what a bond is; if you don't, you'll need to look it up.<p>(1) The fed basically sets the interest rates in the bond market. The real mechanisms are complicated and have a lot of ""moving parts"", but the basic picture is:<p>- the fed basically sets the interest rate on new ""treasury securities"" (treasury bills, notes, etc.).<p>- ""treasury securities"" are considered 0-risk (b/c the borrower can just print the money to pay them, basically)<p>- when other parties want to raise money by selling debt (eg: offering bonds) they have to offer <i>more interest</i> than the going rate on ""treasury securities"" (b/c other parties will have higher than 0 risk of nonpayment, and consequently the higher interest is what attracts investors to buy the bonds)<p>- basically the relationship is like: the riskier the bond, the higher the interest rate (over and above the federal rate) it will offer<p>(2) throughout the mid-late 90s and into the early 2000s the fed held interest rate at abnormally low levels (at least by historical standards).<p>The net effect of holding interest rates that low for that long was that the range of interest rates you could get on bonds was lower than historical norms (by a few % points at least).<p>(3) There are enormous pools of highly-regulated money-for-investment held in vehicles like pension funds (domestically and also abroad). CF this chart (from 2006):<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=x4d-lCjRY8AC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=total+size+of+us+pension+funds+under+management&source=bl&ots=ICFM2oF8Bq&sig=0tsf_otH_GlCO-xm5VM0iVXgk30&hl=en&ei=M_HsSZ-3CJLIM5OB3dcF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=x4d-lCjRY8AC&pg=PA4&#38...</a><p>...to get some idea how much money is in USA-based pension funds alone (there's more overseas where pensions are higher).<p>The details very <i>a lot</i> between categories of funds, but generally highly-regulated funds who are more about risk-minimizing (like pension funds) than return-maximizing will try to invest heavily in bonds or bond-like instruments; again this is complicated but roughly speaking the reasoning is:<p>- bonds or bond-like instruments usually have a defined series of payments whose value is easy to calculate; the only real risk is that the borrower stop paying<p>- there's huge pressure not to default on bonds; a dropping stock price is bad for shareholders, but defaulting on bonds risks your being able to continue to operate (b/c you have no way of raising short-term funds)<p>...which makes bonds historically lower-risk, lower-reward compared to (eg) stocks. Pensions and pension-like funds have another reason for preferring bonds:<p>- pensions need to have cash on hand on a regular basis (to pay out claims)<p>- bonds always pay out on a regular basis (until they don't); to turn stocks into cash you have to sell them (or hope the dividends don't change on you)<p>Thus historically you'd have a huge diversified pile of bonds (mix of higher-return / higher risk and the opposite) as the major component of such a fund's portfolio (with various other investments tossed in).<p>The consequence of a long period of historically low interest rates meant that bonds no longer offered the same kind of returns; even a few % matters here, b/c if eg you are using an internal interest rate of 4% then going from a portfolio average of 7% to a portfolio average of 5% means you're actually going from 3% net of inflation to 1% net of inflation, etc.<p>Now, if these were just hedge funds or other speculative vehicles that'd be one thing; but, pensions legally are contractually obligated to make their payments, so failure-to-perform isn't just ""too bad, so sad"" but potentially legal nightmares; additionally, USA pensions are partially backed by an equivalent of the FDIC<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Benefit_Guaranty_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Benefit_Guaranty_Corpor...</a><p>...which currently is self-funding but in a real disaster would probably graduate to explicit federal backing.<p>So summary: due to fed policy vis-a-vis interest rates over an extended period of time (well over a decade now) it's been harder and harder for pensions to meet their performance targets with their traditional strategies; due to their nature this isn't just bad news, it's possibly ""against the law"" in some sense.<p>(4) Enter Securitization<p>What securitization basically did was:<p>- take a 1000 mortages originating at about the same time (july 2004) but geographically distributed and with a range of credit scores / home values / interest rates<p>- set up an entity that receives all monthly mortgage payments<p>- as the money comes in, the entity first dumps it into ""bucket 1""; when ""bucket 1"" is full you send that out to its owner(s), then you dump what's left into ""bucket 2"", send that out when it's full, etc, until the money runs out. It's possible that, eg, once a handful of people default or prepay their mortage that buckets 5 on down stop getting any money.<p>- you call the ""buckets"" tranches, and you do some ""financial engineering"" to decide how many buckets to put in and how big to make the buckets; depending on how you choose you typically wind up with some top-level tranches that have low risk but higher effective interest rates (compared to normal bonds with the same interest rates)<p>- the reason this works is that even though the bottom buckets are going to go to zero (almost inevitably) you're concentrating most of the risk in the bottom tranches and thereby the higher tranches have lower-risk<p>- zoila! you've created a bond-like instrument that has higher returns but the same apparent risk (ratings agencies had a huge role here, again too little time to detail in full)<p>So, there was basically a huge demand for ""yield"" (interest rates on bond-like products) but a huge shortage (due to fed interest rate policy); the whole securitization scheme came about partly to meet that demand.<p>The consequences of securitization are varied: it increases willingness to loan to high-risk borrowers (b/c you sell off the mortgage as part of the security, and having some high-interest rate, high-risk ""pepper"" in the security is essential to being able to offer high interest rates.<p>But for a lot of market actors the products looked really appealing as a way of ""not going out of business"".<p>There's a lot more you could do to draw out that story with enough motivation; it's far from the whole story -- or the only story -- but it's one of the underlying currents leading up to the current predicament.<p>It's nice to have a single thread to tug on that explains everything but that's hard to find; the financial world is a huge web of interconnected actors with interconnected motives.",1240760856

580034,comment,578981,580009,0,0,frig,,,"Oh, agreed -- I'd like to see the notion of ""private property"" well protected moving forward. I just think the way its strongest advocates operate is going to do much more harm than good (in, eg, the same way the Republicans slagging every last Democratic policy proposal with ""that's socialism"" is doing plenty to make socialism look harmless and appealing in the modern era).<p>But, you have to be realistic:<p>- if you accept a libertarian notion of self-ownership, then it follows that, eg, I ought nought to have you blow smoke in my face unless i consent to it (b/c you're tampering with my property, no)?<p>- now, as a practical matter people agree to overlook certain things (eg: your campfire is infinitesimally smokifying my air here back in town, but it's so negligible that I ought not to care about it; very literally the stress of worrying about it is worse for me than your smoke is)<p>- it'd be nice if you can adopt a universal standard for when your (infinitesimal) actions are something I <i>have</i> to ignore<p>- but unless you <i>already have</i> that agreement you're back into coercing people; it does seem useful to you, I'm sure, to think that ""since I've scientifically shown that my blowing smoke in your face doesn't actually harm you, so I'm going to keep doing it"", but now you're not that far removed intellectually from eg eminent domain ""I've demonstrated that demolishing your home in order to finish this expressway is manifestly for the economic benefit of the entire city -- including you -- so even though normally I'd like to respect your property rights in this patch of land today I say 'tough luck!'""<p>- this is why the boundaries of private property are always ultimately a political problem: usually people are looking out for their own interest, as they choose to define it; to get someone to deliberately <i>sacrifice</i> their own perceived self-interest requires either force or politics; force works but is undesirable and doesn't scale, either, so you're left with politics<p>This is where the folk libertarianism (along with any <i>naive</i> or <i>simplistic</i> approach to being pro-property-rights) is going to flounder in the new century, if present trends continue:<p>- you can't pretend your actions ""don't effect other people until they do""; the reality is that ""your actions effect everyone else, but sometimes (usually, even) everyone else agrees to pretend as if they don't""<p>- you look like a hypocrite if you on the one hand want to maintain absolute say over how you use your own resources but on the other hand want to force other people to accept your decisions about which uses of their property (their bodies, their air, etc.) they need to just man up and take; you also look stupid if you can't see this point<p>- you also look politically and rhetorically dumb when you speak casually about what risk-of-harm to others you're comfortable ignoring (and would expect other people to ignore); it's rather obvious that, eg, DanielBMarkham is fine with, say, some action of his having a .001% odds of giving his neighor's kid asthma (picking at random) -- DanielBMarkham is not his neighbor's kid, after all -- but step outside the space of just ""thinking in words"" and you'll see why that's not a winning pose (it's made worse by the way that risk-of-harm is low-and-diffuse but harm is typically severe-and-concentrated).<p>What I'm trying to drive home is that everything you've said is valid, but you're not going to change minds with that argument (at most you'll make people aware of a particular danger if you carry something to its logical extreme).<p>I think the best long-term approach is to focus more on design and infrastructure (eg: intelligent garbage processing, products designed from start-to-finish to neatly decompose into recyclable components -- this is called ""reverse logistics"", fyi) rather than trying to directly win the political war over where the lines ought to be drawn.<p>If you can get to where people can continue doing what they do now but with far less externality production, then you will easily be able to keep the lines drawn mostly where you'd want them to be (at least for most actors).<p>The issue here is that to get to where it's safe to be mindless again is not going to happen promptly (if at all) without some kind of directed regulatory push; that is not only nontrivial -- and dangerous -- but also unlikely barring some other political shifts.",1240760402

Surely three hundred years after Galileo showed otherwise, students no longer share this belief? Unfortunately, many do, but the belief shows up only in novel situations. Students know that if a stone and a cannonball fall, they should say that both objects hit the ground ‘at the same time’; if they have been carefully taught, they might even say ‘roughly at the same time’. They also know what to say about two objects sliding down an incline, that mass is irrelevant. However, when the problem includes the novel eﬀect of rolling (yet more trouble with circular motion!), many students have no practiced Newtonian answer to quote, and reveal their gut-level Aristotelian belief. For example, in Problem 23, about objects rolling down a plane, some students reasoned that an object with a large moment of inertia, such as a disc, rolls faster than an object with a small moment of inertia, such as a solid sphere. Two students argued that ‘moment of inertia is analogous to mass, and heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects’! I could not agree with the analogy, but I admired its boldness.<p>The way that rehearsal hides this misconception reminds me of the theory of the English accent: that if you step on an Englishman’s toes in the middle of the night, he’ll shout at you in an American accent. On this view, the one true accent is American. An English accent is just an act, a mask dropped upon surprise. Similarly, the students’ response that ‘all objects fall at the same speed’ is carefully rehearsed. It falls away when we step on their toes by asking about it in a novel context, whereupon they reveal their true belief, that heavier objects fall faster.""""",1240759112

But favoring Python lists over recursion is like favoring chocolate over logging.</i><p>No, no, it's not at all, not when you approach it from Guido's point of view.  To him, the crucial question is, ""What's the right way for beginners to process data?""  Python and its built-in data structures support iteration and list indexing because that's how beginners do it.  Python does not support tail calls because Guido thinks it's a mistake to teach recursion to beginners.<p>I think everyone is misunderstanding Guido's point because they just can't imagine anyone taking his point of view, so they imagine him saying something else.  Joe Marshall even called Guido's main points (which he correctly identified, and then ungraciously caricatured) ""a sideshow"" and said the ""true argument"" is about the power of recursion.  Sorry, Guido doesn't care about the power of recursion, because it isn't valuable to <i>his</i> target programmers, the programmers he wants to serve.  He really thinks tail call support would be a very minor feature in Python because it's not important whether you can program in Python that way.  He thinks complete stack trace information is <i>very</i> important because it makes things easy and transparent for beginners.  That's what's important to Guido and, I would argue, to most Python programmers.  When it comes to the future of Python, that's what matters, and Joe Marshall is the sideshow.",1240758507

The problem is that the middle of the road keeps moving. Nobody used to care if you dumped used motor oil in your backyard. Or if you smoked in public. Or if your lawn mower spewed smoke. The goalposts keep moving. This trend cannot continue indefinitely.<p>There is some reasonable middle ground. In my opinion, however, we've crossed that middle ground a long time ago. Decisions about what private property rights to infringe on are not made any more based on scientific, reproducible cause-and-effect principles that have a high degree of causing me harm (And I'll stick with my .01% number for this discussion). Instead the ground keeps changing based on current politics.<p>Private property should not be based on political whims -- that's the whole point of the Bill of Rights: that some principles have been proven to be the bedrock of successful societies. It's no more debatable than whether 1+1=2<p>I can't emphasize enough that the notion of private property is critical for successful societies. It's a lesson history shows us very clearly. My ownership of something does not depend on my fellow citizens allowing me to own it. Certain principles are innate, endowed by our creator, whatever-your-favorite-language. Inviolate. It's the entire basis of western society. I'm not trying to argue at extremes again -- obviously I can't dump a ton of arsenic in my backyard. But to believe that it's natural for global health concerns to intrude more and more on personal property is to say that people are going to stop being people at some point and simply be cells performing in a larger organism. I don't see that happening any time soon. The human animal simply won't fit into the little box that you'd like them to fit into.",1240758394

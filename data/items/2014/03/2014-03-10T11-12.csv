7372406,comment,7371802,7371903,2,0,zamalek,,,"This could be caused by two issues:<p>Popping: it &quot;naturally&quot; happens with all dynamic LOD systems (back in &#x27;98 it would have been Real-time Adaptive Optimized Meshes). It happens when something changes from one detail level to another (and hence more details &quot;pops&quot; into view). If you spend more time on your renderer you will generally morph those vertices between the lower detail position and the higher over a very small amount of time. This means that the pop happens over a longer duration and humans are bad at noticing stuff like that.<p>Incorrect Heuristics: a heuristic is used to determine how far away from the camera you need to be in order to not see the difference between four triangles and two (this has a lot to do with Nyquist-associated theorems) because &quot;the difference is less than a pixel.&quot; If you get it wrong you could present too little detail for a pixel and change the apparent shape of the terrain (obviously intentionally presenting too little detail increases framerate).",1394452341

You can trade these with other players, craft them together to create different items, or simply buy them with real money. So far so standard.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the non-default weapons are all balanced against each other. In theory, players who grinded for a long time or paid real money are still on an equal footing with players who joined the game yesterday - actual skill at the game notwithstanding. In practice, mistakes are made (the Soldier&#x27;s default melee weapon is a lot weaker than all the available alternates, although the alternates are all roughly equal in power), but the idea is there.<p>And there are items that can only be earned through the shop, or as part of one-time giveaways, or by earning achievements in different games. But all of those are either completely useless (hats and badges), or cosmetic variations on existing items. Their value is not that they make the player stronger, but they simply tell other players &quot;I have something you don&#x27;t have&quot;.<p>TF2 demonstrates that pay-to-play can be done right. It&#x27;s simply a matter of striking the balance between creating something that lots of people will play and creating something that earns a lot of money per player. Unfortunately, in the mobile world, 10 mediocre apps are a lot more profitable than 1 excellent app, so there&#x27;s little incentive to create quality. That&#x27;s the real problem, not pay-to-play.",1394450030

Makes sense in regards to overclocking and as the op stated, he constantly ran his MBP. Baking, I guess, would kinda resolder connections...total guess.<p>My recommendation, I repair devices all the time now, after you remove all the little screws and the piece you need (like a motherboard or pcb), take the time and put every screw in the hole it came out of. Trick I learned as a mechanic. It helps prevents losing them and guessing, since sometimes screw threads and height vary.",1394449546

Apple is refusing to acknowledge this as a problem, and will offer to replace the motherboard (or something like that) for ... $300 and approximately 5 business days.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, whatever they replace doesn&#x27;t actually do the trick; by many accounts, even when you drop it off for repair, they&#x27;ve claimed to not be able to reproduce the problem.

To that I agree - as the weight gets heavier, you can no longer recover quickly enough.<p>But the squat should be the key exercise for everyone who is interested in strength and/or mass. It uses, directly or indirectly, about 2/3 of your total muscle mass (compared to all time favourite gym goer bicep curl, which involves a staggering 2% of your muscle mass), and was reported to be the exercise that causes the highest level of growth hormone release.",1394449302

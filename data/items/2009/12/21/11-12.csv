1007607,comment,1007409,1007512,0,0,Zarkonnen,,,"There is a big difference between attempting geoengineering and trying to reduce carbon emissions. Don't conflate the two.<p>I'm pretty suspicious of geoengineering with its promises of ""we don't have to change our habits, we can just funnel a lot of money into government contractors to dump stuff into the atmosphere"".<p>Now assuming climate change is indeed man-made:<p>The great thing about reducing our emissions is that we know we won't screw up the planet worse by doing so.<p>The <i>problem</i> with reducing or ""greening"" our economic activities is that there are people who stand to lose a great deal from it, even if the majority would profit. Geoengineering is being sold as an alternative that would mean more economic activity (and hence more profit).<p>As for our limited resources, we currently spend far more of them on cheap trinkets from China, bailouts, bonuses and pork than we do on anything like malaria.<p>I'm pretty suspicious of the sudden flare of ""global warming is a lie / is not man-made"" stuff that's come up conveniently at the same time as the Copenhagen conference. Lots of people with lots of money stand a lot to lose, and those kind of people tend to employ PR firms that aren't above a bit of astroturfing.<p>Even so, it is of course possible that climate change is misunderstood and that reducing carbon emissions won't help.

Simple doesn't mean ""easy"". IMHO engineers try to do complex systems they don't understand, instead of simpler ones.<p>I have worked in automated real-time systems, and I was not bad at it. And yes, I have seen real industries working with duct tape fixes, hanging cables when there was parts movement,that was a calling for disaster, but I will never take responsibility of it with my handstroke because if I let them go I will go to jail if it happens. I know what is stopping a production chain for doing something the ""right way"" and having the owners eyes on you while they are losing thousands of euros every not working minute.<p>That is the proper and original meaning of Murphy Law, if you let something to happen, it will.<p>Even when proper training, people do stupid things just because they can when you let them. I had in my family an airplane pilot from the early days when 50% of their colleagues had died from crashes. A friend of him died trying a ""macho"" demonstration to her girlfriend with his little plane. If you try to do stupid things with a commercial airline, it won't let you unless you deactivate the automation(and give explanation of why you did so).",1261395581

I'd argue that Google's biggest successes were in areas in which the previous leaders failed to innovate for years (Mapquest, Hotmail), whereas Yelp is a very active company in a constant state of improvement/innovation.

My father was a computer science teacher, and when I was very young (5, or 6), I used to look at the example programs that his students had written, and that he was grading at home.  The exercises were were written in Pascal, and I just really had trouble grokking how the computer knew in which order to execute things.  Even just the simple question of being able to identify where execution was going to start was a non-trivial exercise.<p>Line number based BASIC is much easier for a child to understand.  You start at the top, and start reading.  I remember that in my head I had an image of me writing 'stories' for the computer to read.<p>A (very) few years later, the question of order of execution was obvious to me, but I clearly remember those times in the lounge room looking at print outs of Pascal, and not being able to figure out what the  program was going to do.",1261393593

I do, and it's more complex than you seem to think.<p>I know of a case similar to the grounding of the Royal Majesty.  In that case, again, the GPS antenna became disconnected.  There was a proper error reporting procedure that was defined and documented, and yet still no one fixed the antenna, and still everyone trusted the AIS/GPS system even though it was reporting as broken.  In the same way that Windows users are ""trained"" to click ""OK"" on every pop-up dialog, so they were ""trained"" by their day-in, day-out experience to trust the system even though they'd been told it was broken.<p>You also say:<p><pre><code>    Debugging and testing is important.\n</code></pre>\nI don't think there would be many who would disagree with you, but are you suggesting that the systems described had had no debugging or testing?  Of course not.  They had been debugged and tested.  Exhaustively.  And knowing something of the field, most likely rather more than you imagine.<p>Bugs remain, and when they surface, humans need to be able to take over swiftly and accurately.  Increasing automation makes it less likely that they do so.

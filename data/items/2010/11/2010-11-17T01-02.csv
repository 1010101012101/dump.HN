1912594,comment,1911774,1912488,0,0,johnnygood,,,"I have no internal knowledge of Zencoder, but. . .<p>Because Zencoder is running a service, they can have lots of boxes going at the same time.  You might want to encode 50 things at once which would have to be queued up if you were doing it on one box, but can run simultaneously on Zencoder using their many boxes.<p>Likewise, Zencoder can fire up high CPU boxes that will get your videos encoded faster.  The faster they turn around videos, the more capacity they have.  If you're low (or bursty) volume, you can't justify that cost and you go with a small instance that's slow and queue things up if there are multiple jobs at once.<p>Plus, Zencoder is probably knows ffmpeg and the like better than you do.  It's their whole company.  Unless the focus of your work is video encoding, the likelihood that you will have any reason to be as knowledgeable is low.<p>I'm not saying that Zencoder is right for everything.  They have certain economies of scale since they're encoding video for many people that kick in which mean that you can have 20 boxes encoding things for you at the same time for a few hours without having to pay for them all the time or going through the hassle of creating 20 encoding boxes and then getting rid of them so that you can use that capacity for an hour or so.  That said, if you have a slow, steady flow that isn't too concerned with time or you're popular enough that you've hit those economies of scale yourself, Zencoder might not be right for you.<p>Oh, plus you might not want to deal with ffmpeg and such.  Some people would rather it be abstracted away a bit.",1289959154
1912592,comment,1911774,1912565,0,0,badmash69,,,"That is a smug remark that misses the point. Dropbox is a service aimed at everyone and their grandma . Zencoder  is a niche technology aimed at people transcoding videos.  There is a whole community of us at videohelp and similar sites and we have been doing this for quite a while.  We gripe moan and bitch , but we get ffmpeg , mencoder and others to work long enough to get the job  done  --- for the magical price  of $0.0. We have several hundred manhours worth of scripts and hacks invested already.   Hence my question , what do you do better than ffmpeg -- 'cause I would be willing to pay for that extra smooth encoding, streaming   . This is a technical question.

Even though he mentioned it multiple times, and you addressed it, it can't be overstated: there are people whose emotional turmoil is not cured by any amount of cognitive help.<p>These people are disproportionately more creative than the average person, and are lauded ""mad geniuses"". As a result, others (and I'm not accusing the author for this) jump on the bandwagon, mentioning their mood swings as a way to emphasize their bouts of creativity. I've even heard the occasional self-diagnosed bipolar declare it worth the suffering.<p>This does a disservice to those who spend decades on medication, 20% of whom eventually end their own life.

1912535,comment,1910954,1911410,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"The situation is analogous to what happens when a CT machine malfunctions.  The basic design of a CT machine has an x-ray source on a rotating ring.  The patient lays down on a table and the table is moved through the center of the ring at constant velocity for the duration of the scan.  
The overall motion of the x-ray source relative to the patient is helical.  If the movement mechanism jams and the table stops moving, the pattern of motion collapses into a circle and the patient receives an excessive radiation dose focused in the region of the body that is in the center of the ring when the table stops.  The received dose is a function of the time until the operator notices the malfunction and stops the scan.<p>With a backscatter x-ray system, the person stays motionless and the x-ray source moves.  If the x-ray source stops moving, the person receives an excessive dose wherever the source happens to be pointing when it gets stuck.  The dose received is, again, a function of how long it takes for the operator to notice the malfunction.<p>With a microwave backscatter system, the radiation used is in the RF range and, therefore, not ionizing.  However, if the microwave source stops moving because of malfunction, a portion of the body experiences higher than normal SAR.  If the SAR is high enough, significant localized heating may occur, causing burns on the person.",1289957208

Fewer half-assed people stick around.<p>Looking from an economic search cost perspective, if $3k > cost of searching for new job with payoff (both implicit and explicit) = working for Zappos, then you take the money and leave.  Thus, the only people that stay are those that have higher search costs (and given a constant pay rate and 'hire-ability'[1], the only those with a higher implicit payoff, ie enjoyment) stay .<p>This only works as long as the pay to quit is less than the search cost for the threshold level of employee that you're trying to keep. It's also reliant on holding the 'hire-ability' of accepted applicants constant. But it means they can pretty much dictate the minimum level of 'enjoyment' that employees get from their jobs by adjusting the pay-to-quit figure.<p>Pretty cool.<p>With unemployment so high, search costs go up, which mean that they're probably getting a threshold level of enjoyment that is lower now than it was when unemployment was less.  I dont know when the $3000 came into effect, but it could make sense to raise it again.<p>[1] By this I mean checking the boxes, qualifications, etc.  How easy would it be to just find a job without any extra factors.

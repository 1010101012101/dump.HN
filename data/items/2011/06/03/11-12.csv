2615984,comment,2615621,2615621,2,0,brudgers,,,"The idea that Microsoft is going to go the IOS route is so completely contrary to the interests of their primary customer bases - business and enterprise - that it is only the constant call of the techpress for Microsoft to be more like Google or Apple which gives the idea credence.<p>Windows has had HTML and script based Apps in the form of HTA's for a long time (i.e. IE5). So in many ways the buzz seems more of a marketing coup than a revolutionary new approach (aimed at getting consumers to enable scripting on desktop installations). I suspect Silverlight to be deprecated as a web technology because it has many of the same issues as Flash (for which it was always intended as an alternative/replacement), but .NET is here to stay. It is .NET  that facilitates the expanding ability of Windows to run on diverse architectures - since Windows Vista the Windows OS is essentially .NET for many purposes and Windows 8 and WP7 are extensions of that roadmap. A roadmap which, again, is business focused and tailored to provide stability.<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536496%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536496%28v=vs.85%2...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application</a><p><a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/200874"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/200874</a>",1307102351

2615952,comment,2615072,2615387,2,0,elektronaut,,,"I'm in the process of starting one, mainly for the purpose of publishing my own band.<p>What you need is an artist, a distributor and a handful of cash. A record label is in the business of creating and marketing the actual product, and the minimum cost is the price of pressing and shipping the records. The label might also front the money for recording, mixing, mastering, and hiring a designer to do the artwork. Booking, management and live promotion is usually a separate business area, but with indie music you'll often find bands, labels and promotion overlapping quite a bit.<p>The tricky part is of course getting your product in the hands of your customers. Selling them online is one option, but if you want to get the records into stores, you really need to partner with one or more distributors. They take a percentage of the price (20% is a good number), and have established channels for promoting, selling and shipping the product.<p>We're doing the first release on a shoestring budget. We've recorded and mixed everything ourselves, and traded services with a designer and photographer. I haven't gotten a quote from the pressing plant yet, but I've budgeted $500 for professional mastering and around $2000 for the first run of 500 12"" records. CDs are alot cheaper (about half, I think). We need to sell around half to break even,<p>Add in the costs for professional recording, mixing, artwork and promotion, subtract the money for the artist and the margin for the distributor and record store, and you'll see that you'll have to sell ALOT of records to make a decent profit. A couple of thousand unit solds is a big success for a small artist.<p>Bigger labels will invest in artists expecting that most of the releases will be losing money, hoping to score a hit once in a while that will turn a profit.<p>Starting an indie label in 2011 is not exactly a brilliant career move unless you're exceptionally savvy, but it's a fun and not too expensive hobby.",1307101460

This results in the marketing department paying to host websites outside of the corporate infrastructure. So I expect that Sony is letting its marketing departments lead their web development effort since most of the sites will be marketing sites.",1307100226

It's a specialized interface for touch, just like WMC is a specialized interface for couch surfing.<p>In the end it's not going to be very useful for end users unless Microsoft really bites the bullet and forces developers to migrate to the tiled interface, en mass.  Apple did that with iOS, basically forcing developers to create entirely new apps, because the input method of touch was so drastically different that apps requiring mouse-level precision would never work.  Microsoft will never do that, so instead they need to fragment their OS into two interfaces, touch and classic.<p>I fear a Windows 8 tablet will be the worst of both worlds.  It will need enough horsepower to run ""classic mode"" with all of the baggage that brings, yet most tablet users are just doing simple media consumption so they can stay in tiled mode most of the time.  In the end you bring a product to market that costs $1500, has a quad core CPU and 4GB of RAM, and gets 4 hours of battery life - not to mention it weighs 3 pounds.  Basically you end up with the current crop of Windows tablets.  A stylus will probably be included just to make classic mode usable.<p>I'm not saying there isn't a market for a powerful tablet that can run Windows 8 in classic mode, but those tablets have been around for years and they haven't gotten mass market traction for a reason.",1307098903

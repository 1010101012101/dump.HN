7578173,comment,7576445,7576445,9,0,ThePhysicist,,,"I think the problem with the US railway system is not the lack of technology, but politics: People seem to love bold and mostly unrealistic proposals like Elon Musk&#x27;s &quot;Hyperloop&quot; or the Maglev technology but seem to be a lot less passionate about making existing infrastructure better (which understandably is much more boring):<p>As an example, I just took the Amtrak train from NYC to Montreal to attend PyCon (which is awesome!), which took all in all 11 hours to cover a distance a little over 530 km. For comparison, going from my hometown Saarbrücken in Germany to Paris (which is about the same distance) takes less than two hours (1:40h to be exact) with TGV or ICE trains. Arguably for the latter there is no border to be crossed (OK actually there is but none that is patroled) but still, this kind of makes you wonder why a high-tech nation like the USA doesn&#x27;t have a similar system of high-speed trains in place, and I think that the answer has more to do with political unwillingness and lobbying than with lack of technology.<p>BTW, in Germany there once was an attempt to build a Transrapid (our version of Maglev that is deployed in Shanghai, developed by Siemens <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid</a>) track to connect the Munich airport to the city centre (see &quot;Munich Link&quot; section in the article above), but calculations showed that the achievable time saving compared to the latest generation of ICE high-speed trains would be only 3 minutes, whereas the additional cost would have been around 3 BN €, which lead to the project being eventually ditched.",1397318354

Do you really need to learn analytic number theory? category theory? axiomatic set theory? tensor calculus?<p>My suggestion would be to narrow it down to a specific field you&#x27;re interested in like abstract algebra and ask for suggestions about that field.

The thing that makes it so amazing is the writing style: it introduces and demystifies category theory, and then discusses groups, rings, modules, linear algebra, fields, r-modules, and advanced topics (toward the end) with the unifying theme of how they work and relate as categories. It is very much a book that focuses on the why over the what and how. And there are many many many juicy exercises.<p>I would recommend against Spivak&#x27;s Calculus on manifolds. It&#x27;s too dense and too focused on advanced topics (unless you&#x27;re an ivy league undergrad, you don&#x27;t learn cohomology). That being said I don&#x27;t have an analysis reference that fits your request.<p>As a CS person I can continue with book recommendations related to computing-related topics in math (computational algebraic geometry comes to mind).

It is.  But, it gets distorted quite often and that distortion is called company politics.<p>Your goal is not to over-deliver in itself or kiss your boss&#x27; ass, or emulate powerful people.  Those powerful people may have gotten powerful by stabbing backs all over the place - do you really want to emulate that?

It was the big companies that severed the bond of trust, and the employees who had to adapt to the new free-for-all market.<p>Neutron Jack eliminated 81,000 jobs in 5 years from GE (1980-1985). This resulted in the remaining employees, quite rationally, being very concerned for their careers. And thus, they began looking for options, and looking out for #1, because they knew they couldn&#x27;t depend on Jack.<p>Of course, I agree that it is not productive to constantly be looking for better opportunities, but this is a result of never knowing when a Jack-like CEO is going to lay you off. Big companies started this war, and now they have to live with the consequences.<p>The startup movement is, for all intents and purposes, a way for talented employees to directly capture some the incredible value they would otherwise have created for big companies.

They&#x27;d called the FBI in haste and had put McSwain [FBI agent who arrested Serge] through what amounted to a crash course in high-frequency trading and computer programming. McSwain later concluded that he didn&#x27;t seek out independent expert advice to study the code that Serge Aleynikov had taken, or seek to find out why he might have taken it. &quot;I relied on statements from Goldman employees&quot;, he said. He had no idea himself of the value of the stolen code (&quot;representatives of Goldman told me it was worth a lot of money&quot;),or if any of it was actually all that special (&quot;representatives of Goldman told us there were trade secrets in the code&quot;).&quot;<p>&quot;The FBI&#x27;s investigation before the arrest consisted of Goldman explaining some extremely complicated stuff to McSwain that he admitted that he didn&#x27;t fully understand- but trusted that Goldman did. Forty-eight hours after Goldman called the FBI, McSwain arrested Serge.&quot;<p>So effectively Goldman got Serge arrested, using a clueless agent as a pawn.

As there are LNP systems that have proven to effectively deliver to target.<p>Basically, this LNP delivery system is for encapsulating a desired portion of RNA within a &#x27;shell&#x27;[+], so that it may be delivered to a biological target.<p>The shell is necessary because siRNA is anionic and hydrophilic (negatively charged and water loving/binding.) Which makes it difficult to deliver to targets. It is also unstable in serum (component of blood) and can have unintended side effects if delivered to the wrong target.<p>There have been attempts to engineer custom siRNA directly. These attempts have resulted in siRNA that cause fewer unintended side effects and have higher stability. However, this method still requires high dosage in vivo and the effects are limited to the liver.<p>The more promising approach involves wrapping the siRNA in a lipid &#x27;shell&#x27;. The &#x27;shell&#x27; is inserted into the biological system and travels through the bloodstream to the target area.<p>The two underlying causes of toxicity (in some LNP delivery implementations) seem to be: the charge of the LNP system and the &#x27;dosage&#x27; of the LNP delivery system.<p>Recent research has shown that it is possible to engineer these &#x27;shells&#x27; in such a fashion that they can carry the siRNA safely to target, mitigate the undesirable surface charge, and require relatively low dosage.<p>Specifically, they have developed ionizable cationic lipids with pKa below 7 to encapsulate the &#x27;package&#x27; at a low pH, while maintaining a relatively neutral surface charge at physiological pH. Also, the delivery &#x27;package&#x27; itself is made much smaller.<p>([+] Lipid Nanoparticle delivery is a means of biological/in-solution transport for small matter in general, in this case it is specifically a means of delivering small interface RNA, siRNA, within a biological system.)<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not an expert, but I do have experience in a somewhat related field.

While it&#x27;s true that Welch&#x27;s advice is no longer valid, it&#x27;s because the legal, financial, and monetary environment has changed so much since the heydays of GE.<p>My grandfather retired a millionaire after working as a basic GE accountant for his entire postwar life. So as far as he was concerned, GE treated him well, and it treated his family well enough that my mother still remembers the Christmas parties that the company threw in upstate New York for their genuine human warmth.<p>When I compare how GE treated my grandfather versus how my father was treated by the companies that he worked for (taking the ambitious, go-getter advice), I am struck by how poorly he was served by both that and the overall cultural structure of the United States. My grandfather survived a Nazi prison camp for the US Government, and his weeks of eating grass soup paid off.<p>So to people saying that Welch&#x27;s advice was psychopathic bullshit, I say sucks to you. Grandpa worked 9-5 for Jack, was not a particularly ambitious man, and came out way ahead in return for his loyalty. While surely this did not work for everyone, it did for enough of the people for stories like this to be common.<p>My perspective is entirely different -- because the US no longer rewards loyalty in either the public or private spheres. It is in fact punished, as this writer notes. How exactly can you build a company that lasts for longer than a relative eyeblink when every person is looking out for #1, and expects to be stabbed in the ass by everyone around them?<p>LinkedIn is a pain in the ass. Propagandizing for yourself to eke out a good living and career hopping all over the country is a pain in the ass. Both activities are tangential to producing profitable work over a long period of time. Every jackass who wants to get a VP position has to be a hot air spewing &#x27;thought leader&#x27; now.

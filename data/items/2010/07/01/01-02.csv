It was largely developed by the Zune client team.<p>2) The Kin team was formed from remaining members of the SideKick team acquired with Danger.<p>3) Dislike of Microsoft tech and Windows Phone politics caused many SideKick engineers to leave post acquisition because they were forced to build Kin on the Windows Phone OS, which was very much like building the plane while flying it. Those who left tended to be the talented ones who could get other jobs.<p>4) Many designers didn't share the Windows-hate, so the resulting team was very designer heavy.<p>5) The talented folks left on the Kin team were poached quite greedily by the Windows Phone 7 initiative.<p>6) Some bigwig was in charge of Kin and Microsoft lets CVPs piss away tons of money to keep them from going to competitors.

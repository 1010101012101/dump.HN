Good to have met you, we definitely need to talk more about your thoughts in the education space.<p>Agreed, the title, as intended, is meant to take sides. Of course I don't literally know why people were chosen, but given the fact that I'm not PG, isn't that implicit? In other words <i>everything</i> is subjective when you are writing your personal take on something. I assume people know this.<p>The title invokes curiosity, it's why it is the way it is. Maybe the marketer in me is indeed a douche.<p>Also, I never said anything about people having already done startups. I said ""doers"". You have to be ""active"". I never said you have to be accomplished. If you want to be something, you have to ""do stuff"". Painters paint. You are extrapolating meaning from my post just as I am extrapolating meaning from my attendance of SUS.<p>Lastly I would argue that the bar was raised a long time ago relative to YC applications. If you notice YC clearly states they invest in ""ideas"" and the money is intended to give you a 3 month runway to build a prototype. However NOW do you honestly think ideas alone stand a chance? The only public application we've been able to see is dropbox, and dropbox had a prototype already in-use. His sister was already using it. Again, opinion-based, but i firmly believe ideas alone, don't stand a chance anymore. It is widely known that YC invests in ""people"". What does that mean? I'd argue ""you are what you do"". Yes? Character is built, not bestowed.<p>First question PG asked me when I met him:\n""What are you making?""",1256590582
904136,comment,903430,903837,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"This is the part of the article I really didn't understand.<p>The way multiget works is that you send a list of keys to a server, and get back a list of items corresponding to those keys. So if you have 100 items on two servers, you would send 50 keys to Server #1 and 50 keys to Server #2 (assuming they're evenly distributed) and get back 50 items from each.<p>And then the article suddenly talks about adding another server and having 33 items on each, and for some reason sending 50 requests to the two original servers. This makes no sense, of course 50 requests consume more resources than the one request in the previous example?<p>However, if we back up a bit, add another server and redistribute the items, then there will be 33 on each server. If we do a multi-get for these items, we will make three requests; one for each server, put 33 keys in each request, and get back 33 items in each response.<p>The point I <i>think</i> he should have made is that in this case you've not reduced the load on each server, only the amount of data sent in each, and since your two original servers were CPU-bound, you haven't gained any performance, they're still choked, they're still seeing the same amount of requests.<p>Then again, you have to have a crazy amount of requests, and a crazy amount of bandwidth before you'll start seeing memcached servers being CPU-bound, so for the absolute majority of us, this problem is not something we'll ever see in real life. :-)",1256590582

904041,comment,903402,903978,0,0,araneae,,,"(tl;dr Science can explain these experiences, but people just don't find the explanations satisfying.)<p>Many folks, religious or not, believe that many powerful experiences (like love or religion) aren't scientifically explainable.  However, I think it's because such explanations aren't emotionally satisfying.  Such explanations are usually either proximate (i.e. mechanistic) or ultimate (evolutionary.) and people just don't like that.<p>To use love as an example:<p>Proximate explanation: When two individuals have different MHC profiles, they are more likely to smell good and be attracted to each other.  This attraction can sometimes lead to sex.  After orgasm, the hormone vasopressin is released which causes a warm fuzzing feeling in both partners.  After repeated instances of sex, there is a learned association of this nice feeling and being with the other person leading them to hang out with each other a lot.<p>Ultimate explanation: individuals which pair bond, resulting in biparental care, produce offspring which are more likely to survive to the next generation than those which do not.<p>But no one likes to think about that when they're snuggling up to their mate.<p>""Religiosity"" isn't so cut and dry as love.  The proximate explanation of spirituality is fairly well established by science i.e. religious experiences can be induced artificially with drugs (psychobilin) or electrical stimulation of the brain.   The ultimate explanation I think is less convincing than for love.  Most evolutionary psychologists consider religion a byproduct of adaptive psychological traits, such as superstitiousness (associating negative events with some cause- it's more costly to fail to learn what causes negative events than to associate unrelated events) and agency (a similar explanation- it's adaptive to assume that most things are caused be agents, i.e. a rustle in the leaves is a hungry predator, not the wind. If we assume it's the wind and it isn't, we're in trouble, but not if it's the other way around.)",1256587545

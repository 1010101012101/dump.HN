That may be true, but there is a huge conflict of interest for Groupon. They get a chunk of the money for each deal so I can only imagine hey push the merchant to offer as large a deal as possible. I would love to see how their sales staff operates. Groupon's interests are pretty aligned with the customer; they probably view merchants as upstream suppliers who need to be squeezed for maximum profit.",1295261754

In cultural studies, ""Japanese people commit suicide to apologize"" is one example of something that might be called a narrative.  When you say it, it isn't just saying something, it is <i>doing</i> something.  One purpose to which that narrative has been historically employed, both by some foreigners and some Japanese people, is to exaggerate the difference between Japanese people and everyone else.  Another reason is there were, historically, a small handful of suicides which were <i>extraordinarily public</i> and so garnered disproportionate media attention.  They are now several decades old, and are about as instructive regarding Japanese culture as school shootings are instructive about American culture.  No morally responsible person would suggest that shooting up school is normative behavior in response to minor slights.<p>There <i>are</i> forms of apology which are distinctively Japanese.  One is a videotaped press conference during which a speech very similar to that video would be delivered by the CEO.  He would likely be accompanied by three or four people close to the matter.  At a scripted moment during the speech (likely, several of them), all will simultaneously bow deeply.

Also quite clever to do it at the office, when everyone has gone. Gives the impression of the hard-working shacho (which I'm sure he is, anyway).<p>It came across as a business owner who genuinely cares about customer experience.",1295258853

And the vast majority of employers will seek your P45 and pay slips from your current job. However, it is perfectly reasonable to expect an uptick on moving: this is to compensate you for the risk and overheads of moving. Most employers will expect to have to pay you more.",1295258745

2111740,comment,2108957,2109052,0,0,kakali,,,"Honestly I don't know enough about ITK to compare it to VW. VW's original developers just wanted to make a cool way of doing lazy image evaluation. This is its primary difference compared to OpenCV. VW leverages that ability to handle really large images (1+ GB) and to do multithreaded rasterization.<p>Saying VW was created because of ""Not Invented Here"" is a little harsh. It is mostly just a fun exercise of CRTP that grew into a supporting library. Is this the best library for you? That depends. In my opinion, VW's strength at the moment is cartographic applications.",1295258667

2111738,comment,2110756,2110756,0,0,binbasti,,,"Last year I attended a panel about women in tech on the fairly new CCC congress ""SIGINT"" in Cologne, which focusses more on society and politics. The panel itself was rather boring and not really insightful, but during the Q&A a young woman from Eastern Europe pointed out something interesting: she stated that in her country there's a 1:1 male/female ratio in all science fields at the universities, including computer science. I haven't checked the facts, but even if that is not entirely true, the difference to Western countries is astounding. She went on to say that the problem is entirely with culture, and all aspects of it, and that the numbers were just reflecting that.<p>The women on the panel, who were all Westerners, couldn't even comment on that. They were just plain speechless, and rightly so, because most of their arguments involving bullying boys, mother nature, and other standard points were pretty much refuted by the simple fact that there already exist places in the world where this topic is not even an issue. And it's not the ones you would usually relate to human progress.",1295258618

It isn't the transparent request for votes of having 3 comments which you are supposed to upvote.<p>Also categorizing people's backgrounds is often trickier than you would think.  For instance what impression do you get from each of the following statements?<p><pre><code>  - I grew up in poverty.\n  - I have movie star sisters. \n  - My grandfather co-founded a successful civil engineering firm and died rich.\n  - I was kidnapped by a crazy man before I was 5.\n</code></pre>\nEach statement contains a life story behind it.

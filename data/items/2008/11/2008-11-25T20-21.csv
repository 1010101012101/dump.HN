Lists allow for a quick way to exchange ideas. You can skim a topic, make your picks, and then debate with others. It's a fun way to get a discussion going.<p>2. It helps brands reach their audience
We can stitch brands and advertising into the site in ways that connect with interested parties. (i.e. Dell could sponsor the Technology category for a month and build thought provoking contests around their brand.)",1227646638

At this point, there's very little reason to use Reddit over sites like Digg unless you're reading comments on marginal topics that draw little interest.<p>So, the question is, what can we learn from Reddit? There was a bit of a false start the other day when somebody suggested making this a walled garden, which is clearly the wrong thing to do. What we need to do is determine the best ways to discourage thoughtless, asinine members and make the site distasteful for them without sacrificing the needs of the users we'd like to attract. I think we all agree that sites like this one fill a valuable niche, so we need to market to _only_ that niche.<p>* Mere exclusivity is not the answer, as evidenced by the poll results from the aforementioned post.<p>* Being abrasive would be in the wrong spirit as well, and would be tedious (we don't want to become moderators in that way).<p>I'll start: A simple option is to require a nominal signup fee to post.

Git records more data about where the branch originated from, when it's been merged previously, etc.  That makes it easier to merge successfully, without conflicts.<p>Sometimes things just conflict, though, and Git can't do anything about that.  Git makes it very easy to get to an un-conflicted state quickly, though, even if it means forgetting the merge all together.  svn is slightly less leniant, and if you say ""merge"", your only options are to fix the conflicts, commit the conflicted files (and be murdered by your coworkers), or throw away your working copy.

You can make changes to your working copy, and nobody will ever see them.  I know people that have avoided committing for days because we had a policy against branching, and they needed to do a very extensive refactoring.  What a helpful policy!  At least we didn't have to maintain a branch...<p>The fun continues.  When you do an ""svn update"", that's a merge.  Except, it's a lossy merge that is happy to throw data away.

Your data is gone, sucker, so fix those conflicts right now!<p>Git, in contrast, does not suffer from this problem.  It won't let you merge when the index is dirty.

I think haskell is pretty neat! And you can definitely get stuff done in C++. I'm not arguing against any of those things.<p>What I am saying is that in the rush to create the best engineering solutions, we have forgotten how to make programming approachable to the newcomer. Even people with aptitude and inclination get discouraged, if not by the technical stumbling blocks of the language they are using, by the unfriendly culture which has surrounded the craft.<p>Even children can write simple English. They aren't discouraged from reading and writing because they aren't great novelists. Good teachers try to teach the fundamentals and instill both the technical capability of writing and the joy of reading. Current CS pedagogy fails utterly in this regard. Early students spend so much thought on extraneous things like <i>public static void main</i> and pleasing a compiler that little attention is left to see the beauty in the theory and practice of computation.<p>The lack of a decent REPL or any useful interactive introspective techniques make C++ and Java particularly awful for teaching introductory computing concepts. Ruby is much more friendly on that level, as are many other languages. Look at projects like _why's Shoes or some of the things being done with Squeak. Look at the volumes of hackers who cut their teeth on things like BASIC. Look at how many industrial-strength best practices we can bypass while still teaching the fundamental joy of programming.<p>Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto, designer of many key gameplay concepts we now take for granted, was once asked in an interview what the fundamental concept behind his games is. He replied that the fundamental nature of a video game is that you press a button and something happens on the screen. It sounds simple but cuts through to the heart of the matter. Similarly I think that the fundamental appeal of computer programming is that I type something in and the computer carries out my wishes.<p>The love of programming is something that seems to come to people only by happenstance these days. If a language like Ruby can help more people to discover that love then more power to it.",1227643498

It simply says ""Hey, this is an awful lot of money that's all going out at once"".<p>Never mind that we may or may not get it back (although if the parties involved could measure risk accurately, we wouldn't be in this mess) -- but the bailout amount is so much that we have nothing else to compare it to other than these massive expenditures.  There's no other way to get a sense of scale.  If you only want to compare it to investments, the only thing I can think to compare it to is the Chrysler bailout, which IIRC we eventually made some profit on.  The S&L bailout is already in the list, and we lost on that one.  But both of these are orders of magnitude smaller than this bailout.<p>(And when I said that no attempt is made to calculate dividends, I meant <i>within the article</i>, not within human history.)",1227643490

376708,comment,376168,376598,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Why does every defense of Git seem to begin with a personal attack on the intelligence and knowledge of the critic?</i><p>Because nearly every argument I've heard against Git has been stupid or just plain wrong.  It isn't necessarily true that a person making a stupid argument is stupid, but it seems to be true more often than not.<p>I am usually aim for something a bit more civil than ""you're stupid"", but I've certainly thought that very loudly when reading criticisms of Git.  I gave a Git talk at a local user group meeting recently.  One audience member was deeply upset about ""git reset"" and how Git should never be used because of that feature.  I thought to myself, ""I guess you never use the backspace key either.""  (And of course said, you can easily delete commits with Subversion.  svnadmin dump, edit the dump in your text editor, svnadmin load.  I have done this to correct bad merges in the past -- deleting commits is much easier than living with a dumb mistake for the rest of my life.)<p>Anyway, I think my point is that a lot of people are afraid of anything new, and they come up with dumb arguments to convince themselves that the new thing is bad.  Git is very new, and version control is a touchy subject, so a lot of bad (and ignorant) arguments come up.  It is really sad, actually.  When I discover a new way of thinking that makes my life easier, I don't get upset.  My life has become more enjoyable... why would I not want that!?",1227643216

Surely you can spend a bit of money to get some proper icons and not use icons that hundreds of people are already using<p>4. Give me some sort of idea what apps are in there without requiring me to install a .exe.

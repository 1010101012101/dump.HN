4402853,comment,4401576,4401935,3,0,Nicole060,,,"Yeah, losing your present lifestyle and job to go live in one of the most xenophobic country of the earth, and one that doesn't have a lot of skilled English speakers at that, just to make a point, sounds like a good plan, right. You really have to be one of those ""wapanese"", people from the west who are obsessed with japan, to be insane enough to do such a thing through your own will. You don't have a choice if you're employed at a company that does business in Japan and you have to move there for a year or two. But someone who does it with nothing compelling him to ? Madness. Japan is the last country I'd want to live in, among the developed, industrial countries of the world.<p>People talk about racism in Europe and America. Well, of course racism is still alive and kickin', but they don't know what racism is until they take a look at Japan.
In the west we're at the point where we're taking in lots of immigrants from diverse background, be it educated or uneducated, from various countries and cultures in the world. That isn't the case in Japan. It's already kinda exceptional for an European to live in Japan.<p>It is ridiculous to expect anyone to go live in Fukushima just to make a point. Hell, it might be technically impossible. For a white foreigner to work in Japan, you have to take an upper class job, that is, something in engineering, education, entertainment.. or else you'll never get any work visa. But the thing is, there probably ain't a lot of those jobs in the evacuated area of Fukushima. So what you are asking him to do might even be impossible. There might be a way if that person is willing to travel long distances from home to the workplace.. who'd do that kind of stupid effort anyway just because some bloke on the internet asked him so ?",1345337932

How about just one simple example?<p>I did skim through them, so to be specific: hakyll, Pandoc, warp, and scotty are what I'd call practical programs, though they approximate more popular programs written in other languages, so there's the question of why someone who wasn't already a Haskell programmer should choose them. Pipes, conduits, and most of the stuff by Kmett appear to be libraries implementing other abstractions that themselves would have be justified by use in a practical program.",1345337923

You can even get rid of the parentheses syntax altogether and switch to Haskell syntax. People don't do it, though, because Common Lisp is not a functional programming language, and that also would be against Lisp nature.<p>I don't know if Clojure has reader macros that are as expressive as Common Lisp ones (I'd be happy to learn the answer from some Clojure hacker).

4402842,comment,4401276,4402159,1,0,stan_rogers,,,"Some of these, at least, are excellent ways of learning how to think about a solution to a problem. Take the Friday the 13th puzzle for instance -- you can do a lot of floundering around with a puzzle like that in some languages until you realise that it's exactly equivalent to looking for all of the Sunday the 1st dates, and it's been a long time since I worked in any language that didn't have an easy way to do that. Sure, some puzzles are just puzzles for the sake of cleverness (the typical ""think outside the box"" things), but others are about decomposing or restating a problem to make it much simpler that a frontal assault on the original problem as stated. If you're the sort that can immediately intuit the decomposed problem all of the time, cool -- most people need to train their minds to work that way.",1345337682

But in most start-ups (at least the ones I've worked for) there are multiple unambiguous decisions from the CEO along with a good number of ambiguous ones that are all deemed to be ""top priority"".  You can't do them all and you don't know the weights that are assigned to each of the ""top priorities"" so you duck out on things that seem like lower priorities.  In a typical chaotic startup company it wouldn't surprise me at all that something like regular 1:1 meetings with your manager could fall by the wayside.",1345337558

You add one feature at a time, the one that has the largest gradient with respect to the loss. i.e. you pick the feature that looks like it will fit the data the best, given what the model currently knows, and then add the feature to the model. You can then choose the optimal weight for the feature using a line search.<p>Why is SGD necessary in this scenario? After you picked your features, did you go back and re-adjust the weights? I'm not sure why this is necessary. If you are going to do SGD over many features with strong normalization, why not do it over the <i>entire</i> feature vector and see which features disappear?",1345337524

Getting the $99/yr part free from low-tier credit cards is fairly common, too.<p>Amex Platinum (which, admittedly, is $450/yr) also gets you into a lot of lounges.<p>Founders Card gets you lounge access through mid-tier airline status on a few airlines (especially useful for Cathay Pacific, my favorite airline in the world).<p>I'd totally prefer a coach ticket + $50 lounge pass + + nice ipad and iphone and $500 headphones + nicer hotel room, food, car, etc. at destination, to paid first class tickets.",1345335507

If it costs less to produce a product overseas than here, then the price for that product will drop. Lower cost of product means higher standards of living for everyone. Why do you think so many people have smartphones? How many do you think would have smartphones if they were manufactured here?<p>On top of this, the number of jobs is not a fixed number. The workers who lost their jobs in manufacturing can be more productive in other jobs, which benefits everyone. Also, money people save by purchasing cheaper products is money that can be spent elsewhere, increasing demand for other goods and thus  supply, which means more workers in other areas. By only looking at the smaller picture losses (manufacturing jobs), you're missing out on the larger picture gains (greater productivity, higher standards of living).",1345335267

You can't get a voter's ID without a proof of address (that can be a bank statement, utility bill, etc.) - the same contraints apply to the others.

I've been to the US and Europe. Their respective governments have my fingerprints/iris scans (needed for visas), it's not really a big deal if the Indian government has them too.

Presented with a classic blank slate problem, I decided (perhaps in poor judgement and time mis-managed) to invest some time into starting a ('automatable') build process.<p>Anyways, if you've got a minute and can take a look (link at bottom), recommend any tools/tooling missing, and any good books that speak to these topics. Or, any constructive criticism that occurs to you as it might be entirely to sparse on the details.  Thanks!<p>http://kleevr.blogspot.com/2008/05/c-build-automation-using-svn-havent.html<p>* I just realized I may have been using 'Ask YC:<i>', when I should've been using 'Ask HN:</i>',... or perhaps 'Ask <i>1:</i>' *<p><i></i> and just remember shift-8 makes things italic",1211136744

193518,comment,193381,193381,0,0,lux,,,"You know, I would love an official API and several other features mentioned.  But what I really want to see is faster serving of the Javascript included in my pages.<p>Several times recently, I've gone to my sites and it seems to never finish loading because Analytics is being slow again.  It's at the foot of the page and installed correctly, but since it doesn't finish or close its connection it keeps the loading icon spinning forever which makes some users think there's still more to come.  The last thing any analytics package should do is decrease the speed perception of your site.<p>Simple solution:<p>a) We download and install the Javascript on our end -- less for Google to serve, so they can focus on just saving the data.<p>b) They email us whenever a new version of the Javascript comes out, so we can update our copies.<p>That's not so hard, is it?  Analytics is a nice stats interface, but it doesn't feel like it's been improved much (except for a new skin) in a long time.  Expecting the above to be fixed, even just by improving the speed/stability of their JS serving, is the least we can hope for really.",1211136093

193508,comment,193284,193483,0,0,mtts,,,"The point is that food is not video games. Food is a necessity for survival, unlike video games, and one that isn't best produced by the free market.<p>If farmers are not subsidized, you get things like the current food crisis: big companies squeeze out poor third world farmers, then food becomes more expensive to produce so the big companies, who care about profit more than farming, decide to produce less of it to drive up prices, resulting in a food shortage in the third world, one that the third world can't solve anymore because its farmers are bankrupt (short version).<p>Add to that the fact that the food produced by free market forces is often of dubious quality and nutritional value and it becomes clear, to me, that maybe farm subsidies are the lesser of two evils.<p>I agree with you, however, that the government shouldn't subsidize video games.

MS Windows is viewed as inappropriate for the same reasons that the laptop wasn't originally shipped with XFCE or GNOME.<p>As an interested observer, it seemed to me that both these arguments were prominent design objectives for a long time.

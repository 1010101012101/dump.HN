It&#x27;s significantly more difficult for the app developer to maliciously update only your copy, and not every copy. Updating everyone&#x27;s copy has higher much risk.<p>> Is it that browser apps get &quot;reinstalled&quot; on every use, and not &quot;only&quot; when an autoupdater or user detects a new version?<p>Yes. You might not be able to reverse engineer the Dropbox client, but you can download it from several places and see if it&#x27;s the same.<p>If I&#x27;m a developer who releases some software version 1.2.3 with a trojan in it, I can&#x27;t easily take it back, making the risk of detection significant. You have stuff like the NIST NSRL out there compiling databases of hashes of all the software they can get their hands on. You have security researchers reverse engineering patches looking for silently fixed vulnerabilities.<p>With a web page it&#x27;s really easy to serve the trojan once to a specific user. The risk is very low. Hushmail did it, for example.<p>The fact that operating system vendors have the power to trojan us at will is a huge problem. And thanks to online activation many users are easily identified for targeting. I don&#x27;t think many people want to talk about it because it&#x27;s so difficult to fix.",1425869939
9168727,comment,9167008,9167008,0,0,EdgarVerona,,,"I agree with other&#x27;s statements about not judging prematurely.  I feel like every software engineer I have ever run into (including and especially myself) has done some or all of these things at one point or another.  We all have bad days, we all have poor judgment sometimes.  Giving people the benefit of the doubt in cases of lapsed judgment seems like it would create a far less hostile work environment.  If it&#x27;s systemic, it&#x27;s one thing... but let&#x27;s try to avoid a witch hunt mentality.  Everyone&#x27;s going to have off days.<p>The only one whose legitimacy as an antipattern I would question however would be this one:<p>>&quot;Bulldozer code&quot; that gives the appearance of refactoring by breaking out chunks into subroutines, but that are impossible to reuse in another context (very high cohesion)<p>I think it is useful to break up complex logic into discrete methods that represent some logical step in the overall algorithm.  If they&#x27;re private methods, I feel like that can add to the readability of the algorithm rather than having it be in one monolithic chunk.  I&#x27;ve seen two camps on this - keep it inline vs. make private methods for discrete steps, and I find the latter to be more readable when I look through code (my own or someone else&#x27;s).<p>There is a limit to that, of course.  If you end up with a tangled tree of methods, that could work against readability... but even then, if you took that tangled tree and made it a single monolithic method, how often would that actually end up being more readable?",1425869933

I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s frustrating a  as a second language speaker sometimes. However, the idea that cockneys are simply <i>refusing</i> to speak in Received Pronunciation is just laughable to any British person.

9168714,comment,9165917,9166982,0,0,crdb,,,"From the point of view of someone hiring/interviewing/having spent some time around PhDs, I&#x27;d say the main benefit is that it pushes you to be intellectually more capable. In a good university, doing original research, you&#x27;ll be doing a lot of actual thinking and continuous learning and be pushed to do more of it than you&#x27;d do naturally. This is the main reason I wish I had done a PhD, although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m smart enough to have gotten in a good programme (graduated with a 2.2 in engineering from Cambridge - all the MIT/Princeton/Stanford/whatever admitted had firsts).<p>It&#x27;s in no way the sole predictor, but the probability of someone have done hard things and being able to solve tougher problems [1] quicker is higher with a PhD than someone who spent the same time in industry. It&#x27;s also tremendously competitive (in the same way, say, Goldman Sachs is in &quot;business&quot;) so you can trust the PhD admissions committee to have done some filtering for you. Finally, it takes a lot of willpower to stick through it til the end (particularly in the US with its much longer programs), and drive is a strong predictor of adding value to a company later.<p>On the downside, few people in business realise that because they haven&#x27;t hung around PhDs or thought about it much, and just see a &quot;lack of industry experience&quot;, an &quot;attitude&quot; and &quot;not the most commercial mindset&quot; (usually with a mention of the &quot;ivory tower&quot;).<p>A good corporate job will have you learn a lot (broader, less specialist, probably less hard); but most corporate jobs are not good, and pay well to compensate the drop in intellectual challenge and loss of skills that results vs your undergraduate self (although you&#x27;ll pick up more useful soft skills, to an extent, vs learning to navigate bureaucracies which are the soft skills a PhD teaches you). I heard that across practically all academic fields.<p>[1] Unfortunately most of the problems people actually need solved in tech companies, like building a data warehouse, some reporting, a user friendly front end, are not &quot;tough problems&quot; in the way, say, building a machine vision engine tailored to your specific industry might be.",1425869749

You don&#x27;t even know what legal jurisdiction OP is in; how could you interpret the word as anything but the colloquial definition?<p>>  In the US I don&#x27;t believe there is any such crime as rape by threatening to fire someone, or if there is it is not a serious crime.<p>First, sex crimes are defined at the state level in the US, so it doesn&#x27;t even make sense to discuss what &quot;the&quot; law is in the US.  Pick your state, and you get your answer.<p>Second, if we pick, eg, Michigan, you&#x27;re describing...hmm.  &quot;Third Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct&quot;, which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.  Not sure about you, but I&#x27;d call that a serious crime.  Other states have different laws, but generally speaking getting someone to perform an act via the threat of firing is coercion, and penetration achieved via coercion is one of the more serious forms of sexual assault.",1425869017

But nothing has an infinite lifetime, so while solar is a technology, the actual solar panels that get made aren&#x27;t, they&#x27;re a durable good or an asset, depending on your point of view.<p>Right now, in a lot of ways a solar panel is simply a way to burn a fossil fuel to make more fuel.  Since the lifetime isn&#x27;t infinite you can compute the amplification factor.  Depending on how you calculate it might be a factor of a couple up (just based on price) to a couple dozen (joules to joules).  But it&#x27;s not infinite.<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-cells-prove-cleaner-way-to-produce-power/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-cells-prove-...</a><p>This finite lifetime and substantial capex is one of the reasons people criticize basically any kind of ocean power; the environment is so harsh that it&#x27;s hard to do a lot of energy amplification.  If your maintenance costs aren&#x27;t completely trivial then you&#x27;re opening yourself up to a sensitivity failure.  The difference between 2% and 4% per year doesn&#x27;t seem huge but over 20-30 years is big.<p>1.02 ^ 30 = 1.8<p>1.04 ^ 30 = 3.2<p>That&#x27;s one of the reasons that people like fossil fuels so much.  The amplification factor is huge and it&#x27;s well known.  It might take two weeks to drill a well (on land) and during that time you might use 3000 horsepower continuously (about 2MW).  But if you do the math, that&#x27;s only 672 MWh.  A BOE is about 1.7MWh so you only need to produce 400 barrels to get ahead on the well.  Add in another couple of thousand for everything else (pumps, piping, etc) and you&#x27;ve still got a very low bar to net energy gain.",1425869011

Maybe it would&#x27;ve a very hard choice indeed, both socially and career-wise but she did have that choice. It might be convenient in some cases to broaden the definition of rape gradually but the bottom line is you can not be raped if you are simply able to walk away.<p>It might be harassment.<p>It might be blackmailing.<p>It might be a lot of nasty, disgusting, and even criminal things.<p>In the above story, the partner was obviously a complete prick.<p>But the scheme is inherently different from a rape. This abusing prick could&#x27;ve asked both men or women under his supervision for a number of completely unreasonable favours, whether sexual or non-sexual, declining of which would&#x27;ve been similarly catastrophic for the career of his staff members because of the power the abusing partner held over the matter.<p>But they could&#x27;ve walked away. Maybe they could have restarted their career elsewhere or had to change careers, I don&#x27;t know. Life isn&#x27;t fair. But they could&#x27;ve walked away and from what I understand, so could&#x27;ve this young associate in the law firm.<p>I think the very definition of rape is crossing the very line where the victim is not allowed to leave and forced to be abused instead. A rape is a physical act of violence, regardless of whether what happens is an intercourse or a blowjob or whatever and whether the victim was physically threatened by fists, a knife, or a gun, but the physical nature of the act means if you are able to walk away the rape doesn&#x27;t happen because it can not happen. And that is for the same reason why a robber with a knife can&#x27;t kill you unless you&#x27;re within a few feet of him. A knifeman can&#x27;t kill you a block away and a rapist can kill you if you&#x27;re not there.<p>In some jurisdictions coercion might translate to non-physical threats. Then maybe there it could be classified as a rape. It&#x27;s still as wrong as if it&#x27;s classified as something else. But the dynamic of that situation is nevertheless different from the dynamic of a rape with the latter interpreted in the traditional sense. There is a line between situations from where you can actually walk away and situations from where you can not.",1425868898

  p = &foo; // The addition of & here, on a value, means we&#x27;re converting the type /from/ a reference /into/ a pointer-to-int.

Simple enough. But then at some point, cards were printed that allowed you to modify those values. Now you have to mentally keep track of the actual state of the card.

It could be due to sexism, a distaste for sitting in front of a computer all day, bad food or something else. My point is each situation should be based on it&#x27;s own merit, and not generalized. I am sick of being called sexist if I don&#x27;t think everyone is sexist.<p>> suggest that women should &quot;not complain&quot; because by complaining they only cause men to reject them even more, but then<p>b) My claim is that a complaint should have merit, be taken care of immediately. I&#x27;m sick of posts like this, where the OP is claiming something happened years later, without proof or taking action. More over, I am claiming that there are a large group of men and women who believe it is easier to prove equality, as opposed to articles which create a further divide (by claiming everyone&#x27;s a sexist).<p>Further sick of being criticized for sharing an alternative view, and immediately called a sexist.<p>> on the flip-side say that if a woman is being harassed or raped they should call the police (which is certainly going to end their career if even talking about it is a no-no),<p>c) I hope you are joking. It wont end their career, it&#x27;s just like every other job in the world. If your boss rapes you or co-worker THEY get in trouble. Trust me, the police aren&#x27;t in this tech sexism too. They only care that someone was hurt. No employer would be like, &quot;oh hey, I see you were sexually assaulted by your last boss...&quot; No, not going to happen, this is fear mongering, and is just a downright distasteful argument. Not one that should be an actual concern.<p>> if there is a problem, I have nothing to do with it and should have no responsibility for it (which has all sorts of negative historical connotations).<p>d) Where the hell did you read this? I made the claim that I need evidence, proof, something I can see and fix. If I have no direction what can I do? I have rarely heard clear arguments about sexism and the issues. It is always like the OP, just a bunch of claims without a way I (or anyone) could help.<p>You say:<p>> All of these statements are questionable but were presumably made in good faith, by what I assume to be a reasonable person. That&#x27;s the curious thing about all of this.<p>You may disagree with my statements, but your statements are even more curious. It is as if you didn&#x27;t read what I wrote and just decided to call me a sexist for having an alternative view point.

This is obviously a sore point socially so I&#x27;ll emphasize here that that&#x27;s what I assume has happened <i>because she wrote so</i>. I&#x27;m just curious about how that could, in reality, happen?<p>I can think of a few cases where rape could plausibly happen in a work setting but I can&#x27;t see how they could continue:<p>1) violent rape using physical force: there will be fighting back, injuries, scars, and blood from the assault, and the victim goes to file a report to the police, and gets to a doctor to be examined and her (his?) intimate cavities analyzed for the rapist DNA. These facts can be verified quite easily if the rapist is known.<p>2) a dinner, for example, at a work trip together with the co-worker went one step too far: depending on what actually happened this could translate back to 1) or fall in the grey area in which case the bare minimum that can be done is to not spend time with said co-worker alone again in non-public places.<p>A majority of rapes fall into domestic relationships, dating gone wrong, passing out in wrong company after too much alcohol, or other circumstances projected on an established or a potential sexual relationship, and these might traditionally be the cases where women generally don&#x27;t report them as rapes for one reason or another. Maybe she is loyal to her abusing husband. Or maybe she thinks she gave wrong signals at the end of the date.<p>But work relations do not by default imply sexual relations: there&#x27;s no pretense that could escalate in a horribly wrong way. This sounds stupid but, for example, you can&#x27;t go to too many meetings and let someone interpret that as a &quot;yes&quot;. So I&#x27;m just wondering that barring 1), the violent assault, how does this happen?",1425866850

It&#x27;s like how you can&#x27;t learn Haskell just be reading a book and some websites. And yet, someone <i>could</i> go through school for CS and slide by without actually doing any real engineering / programming. I had a CS graduate TA (for a CS discrete math class), at a very well regarded school, who literally did not know how to compile a C program, full stop. He was very into the pure-math side of CS...but still.<p>As an analogy - you can imagine that someone who has studied music theory for years, has perfect pitch, knows how all the various branches of music relate to each other, which artists influenced whom, etc...could still be shit at playing musical instruments or creating new music.",1425866698

9168525,comment,9168064,9168064,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"My daughters are 6 and 8. One of the biggest questions they have before starting any new game is &quot;can I be a girl?&quot; Even in Minecraft, their favorite, they try to dress up the character as much as possible. They&#x27;re terribly disappointed when where are no girl characters and offhand, they only bought/play one game without a girl character (GTA V, though we skip the missions which contain the questionable for kids content).<p>Even in Myst, they asked/pretend the main character is a girl (though the intro makes it rather clear that&#x27;s not the case).<p>It&#x27;s really surprising to me, since as a boy I often chose female characters and didn&#x27;t really think about it. But game devs could easily be losing money by alienating so much of the market. (Though girl characters for purchase, so long clearly identified in demos or marketing materials, is probably a cynical way to fix the situation. Spending $5 to make my daughters enjoy a game is an automatic buy.)<p>And it extends further, too. When buying a ThinkPad for my 6-yr-old, she <i>really</i> wanted a colored one. Even when explaining it&#x27;s a superior platform, how it&#x27;ll hook into her audio hardware, etc., she was only OK with the platform after I said we could get one of those vinyl skins printed up for her ThinkPad, so it wouldn&#x27;t be all black.<p>Maybe this is all well-known, but it&#x27;s just amazing to see how strong the &quot;feminine drive&quot; is, essentially naturally, at such s young age. (We severely restrict the amount of shitty girls kid&#x27;s TV shows, no Barbie, no Disney products, biggest toys are LEGO, etc.)",1425866541

an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted. The total

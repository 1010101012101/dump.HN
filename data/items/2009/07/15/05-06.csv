For example, most recently, the Stallman-esque group started a massive marketing campaign for Theora--it's free, so we should use it.  This caused the Linus-esque group incredible aggravation, because they cannot understand why someone would want to promote something that is technically inferior in many ways.  Equally, the Stallman-esque group cannot understand why the Linus-esque group would even consider using multimedia formats covered by patents--why would anyone do that?--it's against the open source philosophy--and away the argument goes again.",1247637150

It tends not to work that way.<p>You also have to consider how people react on prices (if you sell the product for $30 in the first 6 months, then start selling it for $60, the first users won't get upset. If you do it the other way around, the loyal beta users who upgraded will feel ripped off).<p>People also don't tell the truth in surveys. They believe they will buy it at a specific price point, but in reality they don't. In survey mode people may think about what other software products cost, and think what they consider reasonable. When people have to actually make a purchase people have to pick between going to the movies or buying a software license. Wildly different results are to be expected.<p>I wonder what other people's experiences with surveys are, and how people go about picking a price. It's certainly a fascinating subject.",1247636845

705219,comment,704979,705118,0,0,leif,,,"Any database engine worth its salt will use some kind of balanced tree structure (canonically, a B-tree or variant thereof, but since I'm on a project that isn't using a B-tree, I'll be a little less restrictive).  This is primarily, as said above, because trees speed up range queries, not just point queries (hash tables only improve point query speed), but also because you don't need to rehash everything whenever your data set grows beyond some size.  Balanced trees get the nice property that, though their point queries are O(log n), everything else is O(log n) as well (updates, inserts, range queries, deletes), while hash tables suffer the penalty of being amortized (fast for almost everyone means slow for some).  Besides, log is a very powerful function.  Even if your database is extremely large (a million elements, say), the log factor is only going to give you about twenty seeks.<p>Another problem with hash tables is that if your keys are large (varchars), you have to hash the entire string, or deal with more collisions.  A reasonable balanced tree index on varchars just needs to call strncmp(3), which can terminate much sooner than a hash function.  Of course, it's unlikely that your index, if it's large enough for you to care, is going to be CPU-bound, but it's important to remember that the constant inside the O(1) (amortized) hash table is probably going to be pretty large in this case.",1247636335

People sometimes pay for additional functionality that they deem necessary, especially in specialised industries, but rarely for just an improvement of a built-in function. Witness the sudden death of any software competing with something newly built into an OS, even if it was superior.<p>I haven't used outlook in a few years, but when I was forced to use it, their search functionality was horrible and never got better.  It's even worse if you have lots of mail in archives.  I found it faster to just export the whole archive into the general purpose mbox format and use other mail clients to search for stuff.  I'm guessing it's not as useful for individuals since they already use GMail or Yahoo Mail, but I'm sure companies who are reliant on Outlook will eat it up.  $30 per seat at most companies is chump change when you consider the per seat license of Outlook is $300 and the damn Aeron chair they sit in is $1500.",1247635137

They believe that people should use software <i>because it is free</i> (free as in libre, of course, not gratis).  Being good is secondary; the fact that something is free should be sufficient for people to prefer it over other solutions.  This has potential negative consequences for developers; a developer who believes in this may be less motivated to make his program better than proprietary equivalents because he does not believe that it <i>needs</i> to be so for him to promote his program as an alternative.  The Stallman-esque group also tends to believe that marketing is more important than engineering; open source is about advocacy more than it is about coding.<p>The second group is the Linus-esque group.  These people believe that the primary goal of open source is to produce, via a community process, <i>really good software</i>; freedom is secondary.  That software will become popular not because of marketing and advocacy, but merely because it is so good that its engineering merit will stand on its own.  Users should use what software is best for them--it's the developers' job to ensure that ""best"" means ""free"".  These people are often seen as ""impure"" by the Stallman-esque group because when asked for the best way to set up a system, they will often include non-free software in the mix--they would design the system for maximum effectiveness, not maximum freeness, since their goal is to produce the best system possible, not the most free.<p>From what I've been able to tell, the divide between these two groups seems practically unbridgeable; the philosophy differs so much that the two sides often completely fail to understand each other, much like the divide between GPL and BSD advocates.",1247634564

(SELECT avg(price) FROM sales WHERE date_trunc('month', timestamp) = '2009-06-01').<p>Not only can a b-tree locate the edges of such a range, but if you're accessing k rows from an n-row table, your index access time is O(k + log(n)) with k quickly becoming the dominant factor.<p>Even when you're accessing one row per query, these queries will often be favouring a particular cluster of row, rather than being perfectly evenly distributed over the table. In such cases a b-tree will provide better locality of reference; you'll hit cached data in memory rather than disk far more often.",1247634197
705165,comment,704689,705136,0,0,tptacek,,,"Salsa20 is an ECRYPT eSTREAM Phase 4 cipher, tied with Rabbit for the #1 software stream cipher. eSTREAM is to stream ciphers what what the AES competition was to block ciphers. The eSTREAM committee included Bart Preneel, Vincent Rijmen, and Matt Robshaw. If the thing you're reacting to is that NaCl doesn't use AES, note that the peer review Salsa20 got was <i>substantial</i>.<p>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) isn't ""all but unreviewed"". ECDH is a NIST standard. Curve25519 is just an implementation of ECDH over a set of parameters that admits to especially fast implementation.<p>The hash function in NaCl is SHA-512.<p>Poly1305 isn't a hash function. It's a polynomial MAC, similar to what's used in the NIST standard GCM. If that's what you were referring to as ""the hash function that isn't even in the SHA-2 competition"", note that none of the NIST authenticated encryption modes use (comparatively slow) generic hash function constructions like HMAC, and none of the MAC functions they do use (OMAC, CBC-MAC, GCM's poly eval) have been entered, like apples, into SHA-2's orange competition.<p>I don't know who you think Daniel J. Bernstein is, but the short answer is: extremely reputable cryptographic researcher.<p>The sad thing is, your core argument --- that it would be ""safer"" to use NaCl using the NIST curves and AES --- is valid, and would have been informative if you hadn't chosen to phrase it in such a dismissive way. As it stands, I'm left thinking you don't know what you're talking about and just stumbled on this critique, particularly as your professional background contains basically no crypto or security.<p>Either way, you are almost certainly better off using NaCl with DJB's bespoke algorithms than you are trying to patch AES, HMAC-256, and RSA together using OpenSSL. We break actual peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms in the field during penetration tests basically never. We break homebrew AES and RSA constructions about once a month.",1247634194

""...as long as they are getting what they want...""<p>In my surrounding I meet a lot of people everyday who dont even know youtube. Why consider youtube, the address bar... They are clueless as to what to type in. All they know is www.google.com for info. When they search they are happy to find the info they need whether its the link on the right(ads) or left.<p>Most common search keywords have quality advertisers. Now that most ads are of quality the user wouldnt mind clicking on them. We shouldnt be forgetting the fact that these ad matches are displayed according to keywords. When you search for ""xyz tv"", you might get a CNET review for it in your search results and an ad reading ""buy xyz tv at $250"". Now the action is dependent on the user. He might either read the review or buy it from the ad link or might even buy it from a search result page that read ""at 50% discount"" which might be an even better price.",1222314198

No one has built another business on the web to equal Google's initial search franchise.</i><p>That is very true. I think Google has a go at a lot of tricky markets. So when it doesn't crack them (eg knol) its all fingers pointed. But I would guess they expect some to fail. They are experimental.<p>Anyway, Search/Adwords/Adsense are still growing. They're in sight of monetising Maps & Video. I think there's a lot of potential there. I don't think apps will ever be a golden goose, but maybe they'll pay for themselves & create a decent precedent for a ""freemium"" business model.",1222313449

314463,comment,314217,314217,0,0,jmk58,,,"We received a Phase I SBIR in 2005 and we just got our Phase II, from the NIH.  I've written 3 proposals, so that puts my success at 33%.<p>The posters who suggest it is easy money to get are cocky and I feel mostly wrong.  The typical success rate for Phase I's are in the 10-20% range, and Phase II is higher, but not 50%.  The problem is that each government agency has its own policies and success rates, as well, the judging is based on who else is submitting during the current cycle (and even when in the fiscal year the cycle occurs).  Each agency has a certain set-aside $, so it all depends on how much they have and the scores of those you're competing with.<p>I think the biggest problem is that large businesses rightfully recognize that the SBIR/STTR process can be a cash cow, so they set up dedicated panels and proposal writers to vet and sharpen proposals, and then find a small company that can qualify and go after the $.<p>It can be good money (it is helping us enormously), but it's an arduous process.  My best advice is to get a grant writer or grant coach who really knows the agency you're going after, and has a good track record.  You will pay a few thousand dollars for help in writing the grant, and perhaps 5% if you win the grant, but it is well worth it.  I found that just our coach's experience with handling the budget and now the electronic filing was well worth the fee.",1222311869

Your route: be a $200k p/m. The other is trying to find some other way of profiting from being popular. One that pays better then adsense.<p>Google does. People look at Google & say: Online advertising is a goldmine, anyone with eyeballs to sell is gonna make a mint. But Google is doing something different.<p>Eyeballs are worth money. Sure. But the going price for raw eyeballs (eg adsense) is pretty low. Google don't sell eyeballs (on search). Not in that way. They sell a processed eyeballs (eyeball soup?).<p>You could look at it like manufacturing. There's raw input (oar, coal, etc) that's sitting under someone's field. That go through a value chain from mining to processing to assembling to retail. The market decides where 'value' is created & compensates accourdingly. Sometimes, it's counter intuitive. For example, many manufactured goods that only have a small part (maybe 10%) of their value <i>created</i> in a factory. Retail usually gets a bigger chunk then you'd expect (often %50+). Here's an ipod.<p><pre><code>  oil_well----plastics------components----assembly---retail-----ipod  \n</code></pre>\nYou can look at the eyeball/marketing complex like that:<p><pre><code>  eyeballs-----eyeball soup-------ads--------yahoo stores--salesman--sale  \n</code></pre>\nA lot of value can be created between eyeballs & eyeball soup.

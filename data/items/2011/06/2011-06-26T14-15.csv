This gives windows a few minor advantages.  Yes, of course you <i>can</i> do ACLs on Unix.  If you really need them there are plenty of ways to do it.  But the limitation I described is, nevertheless, a limitation of the default unix permissions model.<p>It's mostly pointless to debate whether one is ""better"" than the other.  There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches, and it's trivial to screw up permissions either way.<p>The biggest advantage of unix permissions is the culture and history surrounding them, as well as the design and conventional use of the system itself.  On unix, application developers, maintainers and administrators have a pretty good idea about how permissions should be set.  Generally, the need to run as root is fairly well quarantined to system administration tasks.  It's not perfect, but it's much better than what I remember of windows, and a quick search suggests the situation hasn't much improved.  Here's a user who discovered a problem using visual studio, he was able to solve it by running as Administrator:<p><a href=""https://crmbusiness.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/gotcha-visual-studio-must-be-run-as-administrator-in-windows-7/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crmbusiness.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/gotcha-visual-s...</a><p>If a unix OS were to abandon too much of the conventional unix way of setting permissions (regardless of whether ACLs are used or not), you could begin introducing similar problems.",1309098730

2698029,comment,2696207,2697543,2,0,bborud,,,"I discovered ACLs on some flavor of UNIX in the 1990s and tried to play with ACLs for a while.  What I found was that a granular approach to security simply does not work for anything but trivial scenarios because of the amount of state that needs to be understood and managed.  It turned out that in order to manage ACLs efficiently I would need additional tools to keep track of all the state and to discover potential problems in the configuration.  The tools that came with the OS were not much help.  Also, it took quite a while to communicate how the ACLs were set up, and why, to my colleagues.<p>I've always found compartmentation to be a far better strategy than granular control.  Mostly because it means you can reason about a system at a much higher level and you do not need to keep a lot of knowledge about state in your head while doing so.<p>In fact, on most well-run UNIX systems I have seen, compartmentation seems to be the dominant strategy for managing security.  The simplest form of which is to assign different users to different subsystems and to restrict access to these users as much as possible.  For instance, if you run a database, you create a user owning all the data files managed by the database.  You then, very selectively expose only what is needed to interact with the database to other users.  (Interestingly you usually do not let the database user own the binaries since there is no need for the database user to manage these files).<p>On various UNIXen, tools for offering compartmentation have been around for quite a while.  Ranging from various forms of ""jails"" all the way to running virtual machines.  I've even been involved in running a startup that sought to harden the Linux kernel in various ways to provide some tools to make compartmentation better (although this was never any sort of commercial success -- we ended up finding success in entirely different areas :-) )<p>My experience with operating systems and security is that it is extremely hard to make something that is both secure and user friendly.  I do not expect operating systems that are appropriate for general consumer use to become particularly secure any time soon.  We make security sacrifices because quite frankly we don't know how to reconcile these problems.<p>It is also my experience that anyone claiming that OS A is inherently more secure than OS B is usually full of shit.  In particular, anyone claiming the opposite of what empirical knowledge suggests, is a moron.  Empirical knowledge seems to suggest that there is more malware and more problems with malware on Windows than any other OS, thus the statement that Windows should somehow be more ""secure"" is pure nonsense.  Yes, it may present a larger target and more effort may have gone into making windows more secure, but to claim that it IS effectively more secure is, to be quite frank, a little bit insulting since it is a departure from observable reality.<p>Note that I am not saying that Linux or OSX or FreeBSD is inherently more secure than Windows, but I will say that I think the traditional way of reasoning about security in UNIX environments is a lot simpler than in Windows environments.<p>And simplicity is extremely important in security.",1309098119

Now, the medical community has decided that being a nerd is a mental disorder, as if being highly intelligent with poor social skills means you are mentally deformed. At what point did ""they"" decide being mildly different is a disorder? It's not as if Asperger's makes someone potentially more dangerous, like a sociopath. At what point will ""fun"" new drugs come to market that will make ""suffers"" of Asperger's less intelligent and more social, like a fan of ""Jersey Shore""?<p>I'm sure there are cases where an ""Autism spectrum disorder"" diagnosis is appropriate, but I really think that Asperger's is over diagnosed.",1309097825

Or at least the people who conduct economics that way. I always assumed it was clear that ""monetary gain"" is simply a placeholder for value gained. Of course ""I like having flowers in my yard"" does qualify.<p>Thinking in terms of monetary gain really makes no sense, especially since money doesn't actually have any value. It only has value if you can use money to put flowers in your yard, if you so desire.<p>I am not an economist but a mathematician by training, so I am not sure what economists are thinking. But they can't (all) be that stupid. Mathematically it is obvious that using such a strict definition of value (monetary gain) is unnecessary and hence should be done away with.<p>That said, I have problems following the ""envy driven vs greed driven"" argument.",1309096956

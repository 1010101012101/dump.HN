Have the service cost a bit for retailers to use - not a lot, but something to prevent rampant spamming.  Build in location, so retailers are only getting requests from people in the area, and have retailers use the system on a regular basis.

William Hamner, Director of Tax Administration indicated that the agency’s intent is not to extend nexus to a person simply using a third-party server in Texas for an activity such as webhosting.  However, since taxable items are subject to taxation in both electronic and physical form, the sale of data, such as music files, housed on a Texas server could create nexus for the owner of the data.<p>Because of the unintended confusion that has resulted from this change, we understand that the Comptroller’s Office will issue a new rule proposal in order to properly clarify the intent of the rules change and more clearly state agency policy on this matter.<p>We will continue to actively pursue a positive outcome on this issue with the Comptroller’s Office and will continue to monitor and report on any new developments that we believe to be important to our customers.""",1286930956

Why can't patents, even the steam engine one, be justified?</i><p>Patents will not increase innovation, and they shift activities from secret invention to invention whom designs are easily reverse engineered.<p>When the industrial revolution was in full swing in England, there were many steam engine inventors that were working on it, but they keep getting in the ways of each other. Instead, inventors, especially James Watt, ligate rather than improve or manufacture their design. Since their work are built on each other, steam engine tech proceed much more slowly. After the repeal of Watt's patents, engine production increased dramatically.<p><i>Why do you already reject his reasoning?</i><p>His reasoning is flawed based on the fact of taking into account only capital cost, but the cost of using humans to develop it. The cost of development has to exceed the cost of duplication. Therefore, it does make not sense that patents are useful in more capital enterprises because the relative costs of development versus production are similar.This is my economic reasoning.<p>On empirical evidence, his reasoning does not simply match. Moreover, invention and inventing are not the begin and end process of innovation. Innovation is much broader than that. It is also about marketing, finding out people need certain products and so on. Inventions, by themselves are useless without entrepreneurs turning it into a business. If there are only one entrepreneur for one inventions, than it might just fail in the marketplace. What if the inventions satisfy no needs? The process will simply be slower, be plagued with ligation and so on.<p>Big companies do not alway win, nor are they able to copy everything with efficiency, and nor do they recognize all business opportunities.<p><i>Why do you need to read and dig more if you're already decided on the issue?</i><p>As much as I am sure of what I believe in, I taken the maxim ""When you meet Buddha, you kill him"" seriously.

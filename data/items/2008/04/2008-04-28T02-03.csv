I use c, python, and matlab on a near daily basis for work so they are all quite practical.  I think Scheme/Lisp are important to learn even if you'll never explicitly use them.  The pl in 5 are useful depending on your domain, but I certainly wouldn't list these items as all being important to learn.",1209351260

I worked at DoubleClick when Google bought them, but hated the job and quit before they ever got their act together and pulled the trigger.  I figured they were going to fire everyone anyway.<p>Well, I was right, they did fire nearly everyone ;) but in such a way that most people got like 7 months of free money.  For 5 months they have to show up and work (on personal projects; you can't get fired for not working, you're already fired), then they get 3 months of free money after that.<p>Not a bad deal.  I was happy when they gave me 2 weeks of free money after I quit.  7 months would have been a nice vacation.
(I wish I had stayed so I could try to get fired after being fired.  That would have made for a good story :)",1209351035
175244,comment,175203,175203,0,0,jws,,,"Stop this silliness now. Claiming a ""miles per gallon"" figure when you get significant amount of your energy from another source is just silly. Its like claiming 100mpg if you start at the top of Pike's Peak.<p>I propose we popularize ""kilometers per megajoule"", or kpm. A gallon of gas has 130 megajoules, 33% efficient internal combustion engine, so a 60mpg car would be something like 2.5kpm. This will nicely separate separate efficiency of motion from energy source. People should be able to easily reason about a 2.5kpm vehicle with a 20 megajoule plugin chargeable battery. (I think, no one has check these numbers. Notice I had to come back and edit for the engine efficiency once already, so they should be scrutinized.)<p>The ugly part is how to think about the internal combustion engine. You may have 1300 mega joules in the gas tank, but you will lose 60-70% of those in your engine before they meet the drivetrain. I leave that part as an exercise to the reader.",1209350859

Just imagine how it's like (i've seen it first hand: natural exchange + cash in envelopes). How can you run a business, pay salaries and expect some work to be done, if electricity randomly gets shut off several times a day, when there are no banks that people trust and inflation can jump 100% at any moment? How can you do technology in countries where Internet access is 5 to 10 times more expensive than in the West (even with their standards of living)? How can you explain to your investors that 30% of your capital was spent bribing the officials (you don't have a choice).<p>Again, I admire your thinking but that's more like dreaming. I worked in ex-USSR and have friends from Nigeria (one of the most developed nations there) and believe me, dealing with all that shit makes you so inefficient, that even cheap labor won't help.<p>Things will improve of course, and rather quickly -- nearly all soviet block contries are great places for doing business now (compared to what they were 15 years ago), but that's another matter.",1209350672

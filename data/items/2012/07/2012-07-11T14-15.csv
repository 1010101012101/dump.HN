""Amateur"" or ""Semi-pro"" or whatever console gaming breaking-ground kickstarter campaign ( 3M$ after 2 days ) with some great game designers ( Brian Fargo being one of the most eminent ) appearing to follow a ""post-iphone"" gaming trend sounds very very not cheerleading to me. 
Lots of great game-development teams ( most of which being indie ) have joined iOS game development trend because it's a great platform but also because it seems to be a huge and very potential trend/market. I think that the WHOLE scene is looking forward to see the success of this platform. It could mean a huge game trending for Android. And it could also just mean that ""amateur""-hour is powerful. 
I just hope they'll deliver. ( They say that their proto is ""up-and-running"", which is a very good sign ). But with 28 more days to go, and already 3M$ of cash, I think that they can easily ramp up to 5-10M$, which is ""not too much"" to create a game industry, but it's a lot to start.

4229355,comment,4223627,4227884,1,0,gavanwoolery,,,"I do hope they do well, but I am also a bit skeptical.  Here is why: Android is one of many choices I could develop for.  When I develop, I consider cost/benefit ratio (among many other factors).  As it is, there is quite a bit of fragmentation across Android hardware.  User experience is obviously a bit different with a joystick/TV than a phone or tablet.  Even if this console does really well, its number of units will probably still be dwarfed by mobile phones and tablets.  There are some games that work well in a console-esque context, some that work well for mobile, and there is a bit of overlap between the two.  But generally speaking, making a game that takes advantage of the console would probably require special attention.  The real problem is a chicken-and-egg scenario - people will not develop for the console unless it catches on, and the console won't catch on unless there are good games <i>exclusively</i> targeting it (the real motivation to buy the console won't be the TV-based experience, it will be because it has good games you can't play on any other device).  This is why people buy iPhones - not because they are the best device out there (they are not), but because there is a huge ecosystem of apps for them, and the experience is consistent and predicatble.  I am not really unfairly biased -- I have developed games and other applications on iOS, Android, XBox, Windows, and Mac natively, in addition to using Flash and HTML 5 for cross-platform development.<p>If they wanted to make a killer console, they have to make killer tools -- and their hands are kind of tied by Android.  Android is a bit bloated, the emulator sucks, development can be occasionally slow and painful, and like many of the other platforms, there are several quirks.  It is just not the friendliest thing I have developed for...although I don't blame the company for picking it as it is one of the few open platforms.",1342017391

This week, they enhanced the sensor and built in a VirusTotal plugin, allowing users to leverage the signatures of the entire AV industry and analyze every single binary that has ever been executed on a network.

(Madison, among others, was hostile to the Bill Of Rights because he thought those were things that were <i>obviously</i> not allowed to government, and that delineating them would cause people to think that the Constitution was a list of the people's rights instead of a list of the powers granted to the government.)<p>In the modern day, though, the government has so much power and influence over people's lives that it becomes necessary to spend a significant fraction of your attention -- or hire someone else to do it -- to government to make sure they aren't about to legislate you out of existence. See Uber as an example.<p>Influencing government is usually a zero-sum game that people are forced to play.

4229217,comment,4229070,4229070,11,0,crazygringo,,,"I think one of the big reasons that JSON took off is because it removed the attribute/value dilemma, e.g. should I do this:<p><pre><code>  <color pattern=""checked"">blue</color>
</code></pre>
or this:<p><pre><code>  <color>
    <pattern>checked</pattern>
    <value>blue</value>
  </color>
</code></pre>
or even this:<p><pre><code>  <color value=""blue"" pattern=""checked"" />
</code></pre>
And lots of variations. JSON simplified everything into just maps and arrays, so there's one straightforward, simple way to do it.<p>Using HTML for your API response re-introduces all the confusion as to what to put where, and now you've got to decide which random HTML tag to use for which element. For 99% of the cases, I see no benefit to it.<p>The only thing I think of is if you're returning a very large and complex data set, and you want to take advantage of jQuery/similar to use selectors to extract certain patterns of data, which could be a cool thing do to. Have to say, I've never needed that before, though.",1342015342

I'll give you that it's a loose notion, but there's another issue. If you're building a non-trivial web application, how does sending HTML as a media type help you to decouple your data from the DOM? I believe the answer is that it doesn't. You could make the argument that decoupling becomes less of a necessity when you are providing more ""fine-grained"" access by controlling exactly what HTML is generated from the server at each endpoint. I say it could be argued, but I wouldn't argue it.",1342015263

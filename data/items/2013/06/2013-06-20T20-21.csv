5914933,comment,5913135,5913353,1,0,patrickk,,,"I&#x27;ve just started reading Antifragile by Nassim Taleb.<p>He defines 3 states: fragile, robust and antifragile. Fragile things weaken during times of volatility or uncertainty (such as a central government&#x27;s power during a coup), robust things are indifferent (like the Pyramids) and antifragile things actually strengthen from uncertainty or upheaval (e.g. Syrian rebel&#x27;s power during the current civil war).<p>It would seem innovation thrives in the antifragile state. The chaos and uncertainty of war certainly drives innovation.",1371761968

Complaining about it is like complaining that you&#x27;re being paid a specific salary and not another one. Don&#x27;t like it? Go somewhere else. Want to go somewhere else and don&#x27;t like it? Don&#x27;t go there then.<p>Part of an employer offering health benefit is to compete against other employers. They don&#x27;t have to buy it, and you don&#x27;t have to accept it. However, few employers offer a buy-out policy, which is something I would <i>really</i> like to see.<p>Currently I&#x27;m on GWL through my employer. While it&#x27;s not the greatest, it&#x27;s not bad for the amount of money. However, if I had the choice, I&#x27;d take the money from my employer and add my own cash to it to buy something like Blue Cross.",1371761951

Worst case, just load an article preview in a bunch of fixed-size iframes which match the viewport size of common browsers. Better but more expensive, cobble together a browser farm (getting cheaper now thanks to modern.ie images). Either way, make it a prominent part of the editorial process.<p>Edit: I think the reason it bugs me is that text is the primary value your site provides. The image is ambiance. Ambiance that blocks me from the value I seek goes from tasteful to gaudy real fast.

After a couple years of graduate coursework and research and passing exams, it was time to pick a dissertation topic. We then had to defend it before our committee and get their approval.<p>Well, I failed my first attempt (you were allowed 2). The reason the committee gave me for not passing was that my topic of choice was not a &quot;significant improvement of basic science&quot;.  This perplexed me. My committee was made up of members who were all 60+ years in age and had been the founding fathers of metallurgy. Collectively, they invented a <i>completely new field</i> called opto-electronics. When they gave me that response, I thought to myself, how the fuck do they expect me to improve basic science?!<p>It turns out the solution was much more nuanced. In the months that followed, my advisor would have thought experiments with me. He essentially helped me brainstorm problems that needed solving, but he always started our sessions with the question, &quot;what is something that you always wanted to exist, but doesn&#x27;t? What are you most curious about?&quot;  He then gave me the keys to his shop and told me to &quot;tinker around&quot;. Take apart his vacuum tubes. Screw around with his argon laser and sputtering machine.<p>Innovation in the physical world comes from the same curious people that are inventing fun software programs. But we absolutely need to cultivate it, because that is what is dying.

You will end up with way too many conflicts unless you basically &quot;lock&quot; sections through either a software mechanism or agreement, because edits often touch or reorder many paragraphs. A copyediting/wording pass will typically touch <i>every</i> paragraph, for example, and these are more frequent in writing than refactoring or variable-renaming passes are in coding.<p>You can <i>somewhat</i> improve the situation if you adopt a somewhat weird source-formatting policy, where you write each sentence on one separate long-ish line, rather than flowing by paragraph. Then you will be able to automatically merge as long as nobody has made an edit or move that touches the same sentence, giving you better merge granularity. But even then conflicts happen pretty often, and few people like this style of formatting (maybe it&#x27;d work better with tool support).<p>For a book this might work better, though, because I assume you&#x27;d be making less frequent edits, and people would less often be working at the same time.",1371761775

The Merlin 1d is arguably the most efficient rocket engine using a gas-generator cycle and RP-1 (kerosene) fuel. That&#x27;s a very specific claim. Hydrogen-burning engines like the one on the Space Shuttle are much more efficient (measured by specific impulse), and some Soviet kerosene rockets came very close both in specific impulse and thrust to weight ratio, though they used a somewhat different cycle.

The key to 3D deep sub-diffraction OBL is the development of a unique material with two chemical activation channels. One is for photopolymerization and the other is for photoinhibition. For this aim, the material should be designed to satisfy the following requirements. First, it should include an initiator that is highly photosensitive to two-photon absorption generated by a writing beam, which allows for the near-threshold fabrication. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve a minimum degree of photopolymerization required for building solidified structures with a feature size smaller than the focal spot of the writing beam.

5914767,comment,5913865,5913865,2,0,comex,,,"A few points as an outsider about how asm.js could be considered a new VM:<p>- PNaCl is different from a true &quot;plugin technology&quot; by being built into the browser, open, etc.  Although browser vendors are not likely to stop competing on JavaScript speed, in a world where PNaCl is the &quot;correct way&quot; to run C/C++ code, C/C++ compiled to JavaScript will become far less important to optimize compared to hand-written, dynamic JavaScript: although of course there is overlap, the priorities are fairly different.<p>- For optimum performance, some sort of ahead-of-time compilation is absolutely required.  Although a &quot;sufficiently smart compiler&quot; might include ahead-of-time compilation for functions whose types are statically known or speculative specialized compilation in general, I do not think any JS engine currently does that or will do that soon, so in practice you&#x27;re talking about a separate code path for asm.js.  Not even close to the size of something like NaCl, but there.<p>- Similarly, I have heard claims that a custom parser provides a significant speedup, and it&#x27;s listed as a future project for OdinMonkey.  This is probably only a tiny bit of code, but it also requires an explicit commitment to asm.js.<p>- 50% C speed is not enough - I think everyone would like this to approach 100%.  Although I don&#x27;t think OdinMonkey currently does this, there would probably be a speedup by using virtual memory tricks - either reserving 4GB of address space for the heap to avoid having to explicitly check the validity of an array index, or doing something similar to NaCl, plus possibly even trying to detect and convert pointer-like integer arguments to real pointers.  I think this is a good thing and should happen, but it very much falls into the territory of custom asm.js VM.<p>- You might also get a performance increase by just replacing the optimizing compiler wholesale with LLVM?  I don&#x27;t know if this would actually yield a significant improvement, because a lot of the advanced optimizations would have already happened at an IR level in emscripten, and I suppose browser makers would be likely to incorporate whatever improvements into their JS engines rather than actually adopting LLVM, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d rule it completely out...<p>- Some proposed JavaScript features are really mostly useful only for asm.js: multi-threaded access to ArrayBuffers plus locks (and there&#x27;s no way asm.js can be competitive without that); function futures; GC hooks for JVM->asm.js.<p>- And some that, while generally useful in some cases, feel aimed towards asm.js: BinaryData, value objects, SIMD (ala Dart, not Intel&#x27;s high level stuff).",1371760409

Instagram destroyed photography by making an 8MP smartphone camera <1MP with a square polaroid-like frame and the worst destructive filters of all-time. It&#x27;s just a vicious cycle of bullshit.

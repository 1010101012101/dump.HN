Chromium clocks in around 4 million lines of code.<p>2. LLVM/clang together has a (fuzzy) estimate of ~1165539 LOC on my system.<p>3.

I still had plenty of time to learn Rails and work on some cool projects. Since college I've only ever been turned down for one job due to the lack of a CS degree, and it's probably not a job I would have enjoyed much. At my first job, I was the one who was a full-time salaried employee while the intern was the CS grad. Since then I've had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects with some amazing people. I've been a core team member for SproutCore and now for Ember.js and I've gotten to work on some great JS and Rails projects with people like Yehuda Katz and Carl Lerche of Rails Core.<p>I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to college. I'm glad I did (though I wasn't the one paying for it, so I don't have loans). However, I'm also glad I didn't go for CS. Yes, there are some things I did miss out on by not being CS, but instead I got to write code on my own time for my own purposes, not because a class told me what to do. I also got to do a lot of interesting philosophy study that I would not have done on my own time and I'm glad that I had the motivation from school to actually do it.<p>There's no ""one size fits all"" advice for whether you should go to college or get a CS degree, but in my case, I have no regrets.",1332708701

But also, we're still not there yet, AFAIK, turning browser apps into applications.  Sure, I can tweet a link to everyone to video chat with me.  But how well will that work if my browser isn't running when they call?<p>Skype is an always-on native application that doesn't steal a slot in the dock/taskbar when it's not in active use, and also just claims its reasonable slice of memory and doesn't generally go up from there.  I keep it running, and people call me or IM occasionally.<p>My browsers... I generally have Chrome & Firefox and sometimes Opera up at varying times during the day (different browsers because I don't like mixing business with personal cookies, and because Facebook gets its own browser entirely), and they're <i>all</i> closed down sometimes.  They suck up lots of memory (my tabs tend to accumulate rapidly until it gets out of hand and I do a cull), and it's pretty frequent that some site's JavaScript gets a bit wild and steals too much processor/bandwidth as well, so I shut them down whenever I can.<p>So how do I use some browser tab to be always available for calls and IM?  <i>If</i> the right browser & tab are open, how will it even notify me when someone's IM'ing me?  How annoying will it be to find the right tab, to respond?<p>The GMail interface is superior to Thunderbird for email, but I <i>still</i> pull two GMail accounts into Thunderbird (along with others hosted elsewhere) because it shows the little envelope in the tray when I have new mail, and I can mouse-over that to see what it is.<p>Well, and I can still search my entire message history (for 6 diversely-hosted accounts), write emails, etc., while offline, and don't have to provide Google access to my mail server.  Etc..<p>Maybe there are good solutions to all of these problems?  But I can't go changing all of my habits every time someone tells me ""there's a new way!"" -- I have work to do.  Generally when I try, I get burned and have to change back.<p>Addendum -- I'm a technical user.  I'm not completely ignorant of the possibilities.  So take my reluctance to change, and multiply that by some large factor for everyone who <i>finally</i> got the hang of using Skype to keep in touch with their family overseas....<p>[immediate edit: I do know that some of these problems are solved; but I need <i>all</i> of them, or something so much better to my general workflow that it's worth the effort to switch and lose whatever I'm losing.]",1332707969

Of course he was, so profoundly and depicting it so vividly in <i>1984</i> that the English language itself conferred the highest possible honor and adopted his name as the word for it.<p>That's his negative point. His positive is that ""one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end"". Hardly the voice of a style nanny.<p>What Orwell is trying to teach us is this: Cultivate simple language to get yourself out of the habits of obfuscation and evasion.

The heuristics he suggests are obviously just rules of thumb. That he breaks them in the very essay that proposes them is perfectly consistent with his purpose.",1332707406

For some kinds of programming, such as kernel coding, almost all of your code needs to be as efficient as you can make it, so that's fine.  For a lot of application programming, though, low-level efficiency only matters for a small percentage of the code, so it's a good trade-off to use a more elegant and expressive language, <i>if</i> optimizing the performance-sensitive parts isn't so difficult that it cancels out the savings elsewhere.<p>That caveat makes analyses like this one interesting, because the trade-off hinges on how hard it is to write efficient code when you need to.  For me, the significance of this article is that it's possible to write high-performance Haskell in a simple and readable style if you're a Haskell expert who knows a lot about how the compiler optimizes code.  That's a useful thing to know if you're considering using Haskell for a project.

Some daily joke service sent me a text message at 4 AM in the morning, followed by another message a second later stating I was now subscribed and would be billed $9.99 per month.<p>I waited until the end of my billing cycle to see if the charges actually were there. Sure enough, they were. I was almost in disbelief.<p>This is fraud, plain and simple. I called AT&T to dispute the charge and they did refund the money and put a block on my line for future charges.<p>But still as many have pointed out -- what of the many other people who do not notice the charge? It's clear to me that AT&T is to blame for allowing these companies a way to bill their customers and not policing them -- in this case the AT&T customer service rep admitted to knowing about cramming and how big a problem it is, even with this specific service. So other people have called about it and reported abuse, yet they have done nothing to ban the company. The burden here is clearly on the part of AT&T for letting these companies continue to bill people when they are implicitly aware of the fraud.<p>There really needs to be a big law firm that gets behind this and starts some class action litigation against the carriers. That seems to be the only way problems actually get fixed these days.",1332706188

The overall transmission of LCD is only about 5% or so, which means that the back light behind is as much as twenty times brighter than what the user sees.<p>Increasing the pixel density implies that the pixels are smaller.  Which means that the circuitry takes a larger fraction of the pixel [1].  Which means that more of the light is blocked.  Which means that the back light now needs to be still brighter to compensate.  As a result, iPad 3 back light uses 2.5 times more power than iPad 2 back light [2].<p>I am interested in knowing more about the logic and interface power in the way you have described.

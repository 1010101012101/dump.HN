90770,comment,90768,90768,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"This particular article is rather poorly written, but if its title has a ? appended it makes a fun discussion topic.<p>My take is that Digg's downfall (if it happens :-) was sealed long ago by Kevin Rose's personality.  One only has to watch Diggnation with their stupid drinking antics and Beavis and Butthead humor to know that the audience Digg was courting was pretty low brow.<p>Then, suddenly, Digg tried to extend outside tech news and be a general purpose new site.  Big mistake since low brow doesn't mix with Science, World News, etc.<p>The only positive thing I can say for Digg is that at least the comments there aren't as bad as on YouTube.<p>Or maybe I'm just bitter because I got banned from Digg and publicly branded a 'spammer' by a Digg employee.",1197993241

90763,comment,90657,90745,0,0,megamark16,,,"Actually, if I read correctly the issue was that if the boot.ini file is stored on the first partition of a hard drive it will be automatically restored at startup without any indication of a problem to the end user, which was the case for their test environments.  Their tests have been since been broadened.<p>I have to say, props to them for standing up and taking responsibility, integrity means a lot in a world with very little of it left.<p>Thanks\nMark",1197990391

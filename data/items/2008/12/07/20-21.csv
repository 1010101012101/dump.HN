I believe the correct thing to do is to either learn all about Perl references and dereferencing syntax so that you can pass <i>lists</i> of references to your Perl subroutines... or to switch to a different language. The history of PHP tends to suggest that most people pick Option Two.<p>PHP is a bad language filled with poor design choices. It is worse than Perl on every level except readability and learnability. Unfortunately, readability and learnability turn out to be very, very important. That's my only explanation for why PHP has crushed Perl in the web-language marketplace. (It's not as if Perl didn't have a big head start.)<p>I find myself working as a professional PHP programmer. But I, too, cannot find it in myself to love the example that you have posted. To pick on just one aspect: I am sick and tired of typing array() all the time. When PHP was mining Perl for ideas, couldn't they have chosen [] or {}?<p>And, yet, though I don't like the fact that your PHP example is 10 lines long and full of cruft, at least I can read it. I understand it. It is built out of very simple pieces, not the least of which is that damned array() syntax, which is used everywhere and which every PHP programmer learns to understand right away.<p>Let me ramble on about array() for a bit, because I often ponder it, as one might ponder Picasso's <i>Guernica</i>. The designers of PHP seem to have been so dead-set on making its datatypes simple (at least until they made two <i>separate</i> attempts to bolt on Java's ugly-ass class system, but don't get me started on <i>that</i>...) that (except for classes) PHP only has one non-scalar data structure, array(), which serves as both a hash and an array. This is an astounding design decision. On the one hand, PHP arrays are the centerpiece of my dislike for the language, because their semantics are just crazy. I complain about Perl's semantics, but PHP is unreal: Calling the wrong function on an array will transform all its string keys into arbitrary integers, or renumber your integer keys without telling you. You have to learn two ways to concatenate arrays: The one that turns all your keys into integers (discarding their original contents), and the one that doesn't. Or, consider: Until you explicitly sort it, a hash has an implicit sort order that is independent of the keys or values in the hash, but depends only on the order in which the elements were originally inserted. It's <i>very</i> quirky.<p>And, yet, I have to ask myself: Perhaps this only seems nuts to me because I learned Perl first. Perhaps newbies <i>love</i> the PHP array(), because when they see a variable they <i>know</i> that it is either a scalar or an array -- and, if it is an array, they know what to do with it! They don't have to worry about the distinction between an array and a hash. They don't have to worry about accidentally passing a hash to something that wants an array. The foreach() syntax is always the same. You see, the array may be a crappy data structure, but it is <i>our</i> crappy data structure, and <i>OMG</i> Alan Perlis was right <i>even about PHP</i>:<p><i>It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures. -- Alan Perlis</i><p>Is this insane? Yes. But there has to be <i>some</i> reason why PHP is such a success.",1228683397

389104,comment,388876,389069,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"I didn't say I liked anything in Perl better than Python. There may be a couple of things, but it would just boil down to personal taste.<p>Conversely, I like Python better than Perl in two major departments though:<p>1) The way you import stuff in Python. If you have a long namespace in Perl you have to type it out every time you instantiate an object. Example:<p>use Organisation::Project::App::Models::Feature;<p>my $feature = Organisation::Project::App::Models::Feature->new();<p>In Python you would do:\nfrom organisation.project.app.models import feature;<p>feat = feature();<p>It's a small point, but when you have multiple views/actions inside a controller that all use the same model you start to get annoyed typing that namespace in Perl.<p>2) The native OOP system in Python is much easier than Perl. With Moose this is far less important than it used to be, but comparing core Perl to core Python it is an issue.",1228682656

389102,comment,388989,389019,0,0,nertzy,,,"""I recently had an e-mail from a Windows developer in the Ruby community who pointed out how opaque many Ruby projects are regarding Windows.""<p>I guess my response to that would be that Microsoft is quite opaque regarding Ruby. By being such a closed system, Windows doesn't do anything to help developers improve Ruby library compatibility.<p>Compare this to Apple. Apple builds Ruby into its operating system, contributes patches upstream, and is even supporting the development of MacRuby, which more tightly integrates Ruby into the Mac OS X operating system.<p>So the opaqueness goes both ways in my opinion.<p>Due to this, I am very impressed that Ruby even has the level of support in Windows that it currently enjoys. I would say that Windows hackers should keep up the good work and submit substantive patches as often as possible.",1228682455
389101,comment,388198,388198,0,0,answerly,,,"The three main levers in a subscription business are:<p>1) the premium: this is the enticement which gets people to try out your product.  Most typically it is a free trial period.<p>2) the fees:  what does the service cost the user.  My experience has been that if your price point is under about $10 per month, you are better off charging a quarterly or annual subscription.<p>3)the features: what does the user ""get"" for a monthly/annual fee.  The best features have a high perceived value to the user but a low delivery cost to the provider.  The worst subscription business focus on the wrong features which are very high cost to deliver but have a very low perceived value to the user.<p>Some other things to think about:\n1) You need to test like crazy on each of these levers.  I have seen examples where a $14.95 price point has performed 30%  better than a $15 price point.  Make basic assumptions about the different elements you want to test, but make sure to let the data make decisions for you.<p>2) If you offer a free trial, make sure to get the credit card number up front.<p>3) Be very upfront with disclosures on your billing process and have a very liberal refund process.  Anyone can request a charge back from their credit card company for any reason and too many charge backs will sink your income stream.  Make it easier for someone to get a refund from you and you can prevent these types of issues.<p>4) be very focused on retention.  Retaining existing users is much easier than acquiring new ones.",1228682432

389099,comment,388989,388989,0,0,catch23,,,"Although lots of comments are about the Ruby language, I think this post can be applied to just about any open source project out there.  It's always easier to complain to the maintainer than to try to fix the problem yourself and distribute the fix as a patch to others.  Open source doesn't work well if there's only one person who fixes all the problems.  I think it could also be a newbie developer mentality.  Newbie developers are more likely to use libraries that are completely plug-and-play; if something doesn't work right, they'll complain rather than try to fix it themselves.",1228682409
389098,comment,388876,389003,0,0,thwarted,,,"I'm not sure that example, which doesn't do what it looks like it might do, supports your argument.  Because<p><pre><code>   sub foo {\n     my($bar, @baz, %quux) = @_\n</code></pre>\nIs just another way to declare your types:<p><pre><code>   void foo(int bar, void *baz[], hash_t quux) { ...\n</code></pre>\nOr in your untyped, dynamic language du jour with my bastardized Hungarian Notation:<p><pre><code>   sub foo(Ibar, Abaz, Hquux) ...\n</code></pre>\nHowever, as you point out, that syntax doesn't work because non-scalars need to be passed as references.  Most non-scalar types need to be passed as references in C also (I can't remember which C standard let structs be passed as value), which is perl's heritage.",1228682263

Keep up a glamorous appearance above all else, even if you're poor and living in a tiny space. Go to lots of parties and try to get people to talk about you. Have alliances with girls in the same situation, and ""friend mode"" advisors who enjoy the vicarious thrill of being near you. In one-on-one encounters, you have to have a great demo, even if it doesn't ""scale"" (there's no chance you would be able or willing to do that all night or every night).

What you say is generally correct, but I wouldn't apply it in all cases. Anyway, by ""steal"", I don't mean that you should actively damage the relationship. That's evil and also quite pathetic. I mean that you become friends with the girl and wait for the relationship to find its end, which it will if the girl likes you better than her current boyfriend-- and while there are very, very few compelling women who are available and unattached, there are a hell of a lot of them dating loser men.<p>I generally agree with you in principle. And it's not a good thing that the vast majority of attractive women are unavailable. It's much better if you can find a shy, quirky girl who happens, against all odds, to be single and available, but while this is the gold standard, it's incredibly uncommon.",1228681582

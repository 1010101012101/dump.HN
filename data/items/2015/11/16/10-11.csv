If a publishers hammers their audience with ads they lose them. In the short term, people throw up their hands, but eventually those users move to greener pastures. There is a damn good reason the most dominant parties in advertising - Google and Facebook - have the tiniest, and most targeted, ads.<p>There has yet to be a point at any time in the past decade where I said, this doesn&#x27;t work, and shut all of the ad campaigns off. There definitely are issues that exist. There is a problem with mobile app ad quality. There definitely are bot traffic problems. The ad exchanges will be pretty brutal on inexperienced advertisers, but this was the case pre-exchange too. One &quot;bubble&quot; point is I suspect many of the adtech companies involved in exchange inventory may fine themselves on the line for the bot traffic. It will be enough to wipe out the investor equity. This follows based on class actions Google, Yahoo, and others have had to settle in the past and Google especially has always been aggressive about this stuff (although less so in the past two years.)<p>I read the original blog post and the writer doesn&#x27;t seem to make a very good case outside of things that happen in normal capitalism. Lots of middle men, tools, and supply chains attempting to add value along with investors dumping in a ton of money in an attempt to gain some return -- possibly more than they will ever get back out. Sounds like a healthy marketplace to me. Some ideas are terrible, some are good, some are amazing but will never return their investment. That is ok.<p>The bigger problem is for small publishers and likely medium sized ones too. Ad inventory and the users online has ballooned many times over over the past decade. It also is a problem for traditional media companies like radio stations, newspapers, and television channels. I don&#x27;t need to extrapolate on that one.<p>Advertisers need to be sophisticated. They had to in the past too but few had access to tools that told them they sucked. I&#x27;m not sure that is any more extraordinary than asking a commodity traders purchasing cocoa beans to know what they are looking at and know how to be sure that is really what shows up at port.",1447671068

10573710,comment,10565247,10573575,0,0,dalke,,,"I gave several examples of non-Bayesian reasoning going into discrimination, with blood type being the most prominent. Hence I conclude that thinking about discrimination primarily as humans applying Bayesian reasoning is not a useful framework to think about the -isms. I see no need to introduce a new mathematical framework given the historical evidence says there is no such simple explanation.<p>We need only look at how humans do risk management. Driving is dangerous, and one of the leading causes of death. Yet people are more scared of airplane crashes, despite how flying is a less dangerous means of transportation. Or, parents are increasingly worried about the safety of their children despite the clear evidence that childhood now is safer than ever. We also see people who gamble on the lottery with the incorrect belief that there are winning streaks or lucky numbers. Thus, human responses are clearly neither Bayesian nor frequentist.<p>I therefore don&#x27;t see why you think a Bayesian approach, or something close to a Bayesian approach, helps understand the topic.<p>FWIW, an analysis of the sex-based skew in the prison population would also need to look to many other factors, such as the huge increase in incarceration rates over the last few decades, the strong racial component, the different social roles of men and women in US culture, and more.<p>Such a model would also need to explain why, if people thought that men are inherently more dangerous then women and &quot;suffer a lot of discrimination as potential criminals&quot;, so many more social roles which require trust or safety traditionally went disproportionately to men. Perhaps there is some confounding variable which is more significant than being a male?  For example, if the prior is multi-modal, the is there a reason for the two modes?<p>As another hypothesis which fits the limited data you presented, supposed that men in US culture are supposed to be more trustworthy than women and as such have more power and control. If men break that trust, then they are punished more harshly then women, and for a longer time. That would explain the disproportionate distribution of men in jail, despite the the normal bias for men in the culture.<p>While that is certainly a form of discrimination on the basis of sex, it&#x27;s not the same sort of discrimination which made black people scared for their lives in a sundown town.",1447670939

In these devices the CPUs are normally ARM based.<p>The prevalence of GPUs as PCIe connected coporocessors and OpenCL has also made FPGA based computing connected via PCIe much easier.<p>One thing that has not improved, but rather worsened is the difference in clock frequency between CPU and FPGA. In Grays posting he talket about PPro running at 200 MHz. Today we have cores running at 2-3 GHz while FPGAs are hard to push beyond 200 MHz.<p>For applications that are highly parallel, takes a lot of cycles and not suitable for GPU processing, FPGAs might be useful as base for custom coprocessors even for x86, Power, SPARC based servers. But otherwise probably not.<p>For embedded systems FPGAs makes more sense, but cost of the device and power consumption might make it less so. The integrated SoC devices from Xilinx and Altera can do cool things like media processing, SDR competitively.<p>The Novena is an example of a modern system where the CPU has access to a FPGA over a low latency interface which makes it useful as a coprocessor. But the Novena is really not built to be cost efficient.",1447670632

But you shouldn&#x27;t trust your judgements anyway - instead use a profiler - so this is not really a reason.<p>Speaking of performance: I once talked to someone working for Elasticsearch, and they told me that they cannot use clojure for most of their code because of their performance requirements. Clojure collections are almost as fast as Java collections in many scenarios, but that is apparently not fast enough for them. This is probably not a valid reason for most projects, though.<p>There is a huge number of Java developers out there, and Java is easier to learn for someone coming from C++ or C# or JavaScript than clojure (at least I am pretty sure about that). So hiring cheap developers might be easier if you use Java. You might count that one as a political statement.<p>There are some great tools for Java out there: IntelliJ Idea, Yourkit Profiler, JRebel, ... Cursive Clojure is great, but IntelliJ for Java has even more integrated workflows.<p>There are very mature open source libraries / frameworks / tools for Java: JUnit, Spring, Guice, Dropwizard, Gradle, Elasticsearch, ... You can have commercial support for many of them. Most of the libraries I use with clojure are version 0.3 or something like that with no possibility for commercial support (but they work fine anyway).<p>Static typing: A lot of people complain about it, but it can really help you to create maintainable code.

10573613,comment,10562986,10562986,0,0,junto,,,"There is very little we can do in the short term. We have to understand the reasons why ISIS are targeting the west. They have a multiple pronged approach:<p>- Provoke the west to further attacks on Muslims. Ideally the \n   deaths of Muslims in Muslim lands should include innocents. \n   Drone strikes and bombings are good, because it helps them \n   turn the local people to their side.<p>- Provoke the west to hatred and bigotry of the greyzone \n   Muslims (moderates) living in the west. Ideally they feel  \n   further marginalised and excluded. They need to be turned to \n   fight for the caliphate, or be killed with the rest of the \n   &#x27;kuffār&#x27; (western non-believers).<p>- Provide young impressionable marginalised Muslim male youths \n   with &#x27;heroic&#x27; role models. Ghettoes in Paris where the 2005 \n   riots took place are an ideal breeding ground for \n   marginalization. Most are unemployed, have no education and \n   no opportunities.<p>- Removal of despotic dictators from Muslim lands. Promoting \n   instability, unemployment and isolation improves the chances \n   of additional soldiers to join the fight.<p>I highly recommend an article called &quot;THE EXTINCTION OF THE GRAYZONE&quot; [1]:<p><pre><code>  The Muslims in the West will quickly find themselves between\n  one of two choices, they either apostatize and adopt the \n  kufrī religion propagated by Bush, Obama, Blair, Cameron, \n  Sarkozy, and Hollande in the name of Islam so as to live \n  amongst the kuffār without hardship, or they perform hijrah \n  to the Islamic State and thereby escape persecution from the \n  crusader governments and citizens.\n</code></pre>\nThis shows how the aim is two end up with two sides. No greyzone. Finally this highlights what we are up against:<p><pre><code>  As the world progresses towards al-Malhamah al-Kubrā, the \n  option to stand on the sidelines as a mere observer is being \n  lost. As those with hearts diseased by hypocrisy and bid’ah \n  are driven towards the camp of kufr, those with a mustard \n  seed of sincerity and Sunnah are driven towards the camp of \n  īmān.\n\n  Muslims in the crusader countries will find themselves \n  driven to abandon their homes for a place to live in the \n  Khilāfah, as the crusaders increase persecution against \n  Muslims living in Western lands so as to force them into a \n  tolerable sect of apostasy in the name of “Islam” before \n  forcing them into blatant Christianity and democracy.\n  \n  Muslims in the lands ruled by the apostate tawāghīt will \n  find themselves driven to the wilāyāt of the Islamic State, \n  as the tawāghīt increase their imprisonment of any Muslim \n  they think might have a mustard seed of jealousy for his \n  religion, or lead them to apostatize by working as agents, \n  soldiers, and puppets serving the banner of the tāghūt.\n  \n  Mujāhidīn in the lands of jihād will find themselves driven \n  to join the ranks of the Khilāfah, or forced to wage war \n  against it on the side of those willing to cooperate with \n  the munāfiqīn and murtaddīn against the Khilāfah. If they do \n  not execute these treacherous orders, they will be \n  considered khawārij by their leaders and face the sword of \n  “independent” courts infiltrated by the Sufis, the Ikhwān, \n  and the Salūlī sects.\n\n  Eventually, the grayzone will become extinct and there will \n  be no place for grayish calls and movements. There will only \n  be the camp of īmān versus the camp of kufr.\n</code></pre>\nISIS believe in a prophesy. They are trying to make it come true. If you look at the list of things above, we are falling slowly into their hands, one step at a time.<p>The sad thing is that there is no quick fix. We could leave the middle east and stop interfering. It would be a good first step to defusing tensions based on our presence there, but it would simply open the door to ISIS at the moment, leaving a vacuum for them to fill.<p>If we go full out war, with boots on the ground then we end up joining a fight that we cannot win.<p>I&#x27;ve heard calls to &quot;nuke them back to the stone age&quot;. That&#x27;s great, but many of them are living amongst us. Paris has had several terrorist attacks and the vast majority of the attacks were French born. The same went for the attacks in London.<p>Long term we need to add to the grey zone. In fact we need to westernise and have inclusive policies to make sure the marginalized Muslim youth (in fact all disenfranchised youths) are included in society. They need to see that they have a future.<p>The best thing we can do is to train them and employ them, making them valuable members of society and giving them something to feel proud of.<p>At the moment, poisonous Mullahs are doing that job a hell of a lot better than we are.<p>[1] Source: THE EXTINCTION OF THE GRAYZONE: <a href=""https://archive.is/VE0jj#selection-459.1-463.388"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.is/VE0jj#selection-459.1-463.388</a>",1447669240

Just because it doesn&#x27;t appear to work for yourself, doesn&#x27;t mean that targeting is not worthwhile. It&#x27;s not really designed for an improved user experience, but to provide an advantage to those running the ad campaigns.<p>The crucial thing that people forget, is that that targeting only has to be a little bit better than random to be worth doing (from the ad operations perspective). Given a large number of ads shown every day, with nominal cost, we&#x27;ve only got to push a fraction of those toward users with a slightly better propensity to interact to increase the interaction rate, and get paid more from the advertiser (presuming a model where the advertiser pays us based upon interactions that we generate).<p>One of the reasons that it is profitable is that the amount we might get paid for an interaction could 50p, £1 or even £10 depending upon the client and media. The cost of showing that ad is a few pence per thousand! So, we can get it wrong many many times, and still show a statistically significant improvement in interaction rates and make a huge dent in profitability for ourselves.<p>I discuss all of this in Chapter 5 of Algorithms of the Intelligent Web. 2nd Ed. <a href=""https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-of-the-intelligent-web-second-edition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-of-the-intelligent-...</a>",1447669171

E-mail is still a very poor medium to facilitate long threads with many participants. E-mail as notifications (push) is lacking. E-mail as an interface to software systems (e.g. ticket tracking systems) is lacking.<p>These deficiencies are all easy to fix in a technical sense, but practically impossible to address due to the federated nature of the system. The few changes we do end up getting (HTML bodies, and even MIME before then) are long and painful, and are largely resolved by &quot;might is right&quot;. Others unilaterally break fundamental features, such as curbing spam by essentially banning decentralised SMTP. If you rely on being able to send out large quantities of email, you either have to pay a gatekeeper, or hire a specialist in the dark arts of actually have your email go through. This dark art consists of keeping track of the many ways in which the large players in the e-mail world systematically break the protocol to combat spam.<p>We have essentially abandoned the federated nature of email and handed over one-sided control to a small group of companies (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, perhaps a few other) in order to effectively curb spam. The alternative would have been the end of email.<p>XMPP fails because it tries to, indeed <i>needs to</i>, boil the ocean. There&#x27;s an extension, or two or seven, for every conceivable feature and use case, and so you need to choose which set of features in a n-furcated (where <i>n</i> is tragically large) set you want/need, and live with the fact the these aren&#x27;t perfectly compatible with deployments that has made other choices. And so the federation and standards compatibility is really only theoretical, and then, what&#x27;s the point? If spam killed truly federated email (and the need for actual working encryption might well finish it off), mobile killed XMPP.<p>Hopefully, at some point, the IM features of Slack, Twitter, Google Hangouts, iMessage, HipChat, Yammer, Skype, Whatsapp and friends are going to converge enough that an open source application can emerge and define a basic set of features through domination, in much the same way Wordpress ate the blogging world, and that can then lay the foundation for interoperability.",1447668382

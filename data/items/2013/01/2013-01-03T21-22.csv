5004946,comment,5004423,5004907,5,0,Xcelerate,,,"I was trying to write my post so that it comes across in a way that doesn't require stat. mech to understand (you just need to know how derivatives work).  You don't have to understand how the equations are derived to understand what the result means.<p>To explain what I mean by states, consider a 3-bit string.  How many states are there?  2^3 = 8 states.  Similarly, if you have a collection of particles, there's only a finite number of ""arrangements"" (for lack of a better word) that these particles can be in.  The more possible arrangements, the higher the entropy.<p>I added another post on why I think the headline is misleading.  Basically, if the article's intent is to explain the subject to non-physicists, they're just going to confuse people by using that word ""temperature"".  Instead, it's better to say what you normally think of as temperature (hot and cold) has a more precise, mathematical definition that doesn't really correspond to intuitive notions of hot and cold any more.<p>> Still, it's the top comment because every top comment on Hacker News is ""that headline is misleading.""<p>And for good reason.  That's why the article gets so much attention and discussion.  If it had been submitted as ""Unique quantum gas has decreasing entropy for increasing energy"" it would have no replies.",1357250386

5004943,comment,5004333,5004580,2,0,electromagnetic,,,"I know I've noticed a boost in the amount of properties that have solar in my area in just the past few years. Solar pool heaters are very common now too.<p>With companies offering financing for the sell-back programs with solar it's going to improve, I know bungalows in our area that can get a decent sized system installed can make about $2200 a year, pay nothing for the installation of the system, and get tax cuts. Smaller systems are still worth it, you're just not going to get many people paying $10,000 up front for a few kilowatt system that'll take 7-8 years to pay back.<p>I expect as efficiency in systems go up there'll be a huge improvement in the numbers of people with solar. I know with the current systems I can only get a 2-3KW system on my roof (the south facing portion), which isn't worth it with the install costs, etc required for the sell-back programs. In 10 years when the solar panels being sold are close to the efficiency we see in labs today, it will be cost effective for just about every property in a suburban area to get solar systems set up.<p>We're literally on the precipice of a power revolution. I wouldn't be surprised if we see architecture change to increase the amount of south facing roof to increase the amount of energy properties can get. Imagine when the majority of power for cities is being supplied by the suburbs surrounding them.<p>Any abundance in electricity will absolutely fuck the natural gas market. I know running an electric furnace in my area costs about 50% more than natural gas, but when home owners are making more money from their solar system than they're consuming, electric furnaces and hot water heaters will break peoples energy expenses even. Paying $0 a month for all your utilities, or even getting paid per month, will change the entire energy market.",1357250333

5004928,comment,5002430,5004607,2,0,orangethirty,,,"<i>As a professional in this field, I assume you are aware that ""spam"" is also known as ""UCE"", which stands for ""unsolicited commercial email,"" and ""UBE"", which stands for ""unsolicited bulk email."" Note how ""unsolicited"" is right there in both of them.</i><p>Good point. Unsolicited communication is not positive on certain situations. Though by your tone, every form of unsolicited commercial communication is unwanted. If this were the case, Google would be dirt poor due to their ads system being a failure.<p><i>The difference between ""shaking hands and smiling"" and what you are describing is that shaking hands and smiling is something you do one-to-one. Buying a list and blasting email to it is not. It's not personal, it's not individual. It's more like using a dialer to blast faxes to fax machines than any one-on-one salesmanship.</i><p>Sending a personalized email to each person in a group of people is the same as shaking their hand as smiling. It is personal, and it is individual. You may be confusing it with other techniques you may use. But my experience and focus shows that personalized and individual communication is not to be confused with spam. And not, its not like sending out faxes like a madman.<p><i>And more importantly, you're not allowing people to opt out. There are a range of body language indicators and other social cues that people can use to tell you your smile and handshake are not wanted. Someone who happens to end up on a list you bought has no such recourse.</i><p>Where does it say that people cannot opt out? Again, you seem to be approaching this from an uninformed angle. And you are right. People do end up in malining lists. Is it bad? No. Should they be able to opt out? Definitely. I receive a lot of catalogs by email and regular mail. My child has personally benefited from me buying from such catalogs (she has asthma). Is it of no value then? Is it unlike a friendly salesman coming by my home and showing me a product that will benefit my child? No.<p><i>Yes. Yes you are. Ethical marketers build their list via opt-in mechanisms. Your mechanism is the opposite: you assume everyone on your purchased list wants your messages, and force them to opt out if they do not. In other words, you are creating work for the people on your list who don't want your messages. Which means that for those folks, not only are you not adding value to their lives, you are subtracting value by creating a new problem they have to deal with where none existed before.</i><p>Do not even dare to insult me publicly my calling me unethical. If you cannot provide a coherent arguement then do not post. Such attitude only shows that you are unequipped to handle a mature discussion.<p>Now, to refute your point:<p>Ethics vary from people to people, culture to culture, markets to markets. You cannot tie yourself down to ethics because you will never succeed at being 100% ethical. I'm not saying you should not make it a priority to be ethical, but that you should be pragmmatic about it. I do not take lightly when someone stands up and screams about being an ""Ethical Marketer."" It shows that they have no clue about different cultures and society. Of course, you should never do anything illegal and/or immoral. But ethics are too wide to comply with all. What one should aim for is to judge their marketing in the following manner: Am I providing value to people? Am I violating their privacy? Am I abusing their trust?<p>Opt-in marketing, otherwise known as permission based marketing is one of the many techniques you can use to generate a mailing list of pre-qualified customers. But in your ""Ethical Marketer"" world, how would a business create such list if they cannot, by your definition, even do a cold mailing on a given demographic?<p>Opt-in marketing works when you already have a marketing campaign running. But you will always, always end up communicating unsolicitied commercial messages because, and pay attention, everything you say, do, or write about your business is a commercial message. So if I submit a blog post about how I wrote a book that benefits startups, and provide a link for them to buy it, then, by your definition, I'm being unethical because they did not opt-in. So we can go ahead and call patio11 an unethical marketer because he posts about his business from time to time. We should also call every startup out there who is trying to gain some traction by writing good informative posts about the problems they are aiming to fix a spammer. Because its unethical due to me not being able to opt in!<p><i>In my experience, the people who shout most loudly about their sterling ethics and critical importance are usually the least ethical and least important. YMMV, of course.</i><p>I've been told worse insults by better people.<p><i>Edit</i><p>I visited your website. <a href=""http://jasonlefkowitz.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonlefkowitz.net/</a>
Its full of unsolicited commercial messages.<p>You have:<p>On the bottom right corner an advertisement for a fonts website. I did not solicit that advertisement. How do I opt out, even though I have Ad-block?<p>On your about page, you have about 16 different unsolicited marketing messages. You coul dhave just written a nice about page about who you are. But you chose to spam (by your definition) people with every link to your business.<p>And I know you will say that I decided to visit the page, thus I solicited it. Not quite. I visited your page to learn more about you. Not about what your business does. I sincerely took my time to see who you were and where you are coming from. Hey, maybe this guy has been dealing with asshole marketers all his life. Maybe I can help him out in any way. But no. All you did was talk about your business, so I would subscribe to your mailing list, Facebook page, twitter account, AOL IM, Flickr, LinkedIn, and blog.<p>Still, I wish you good luck. And do send me unsolicited email from time to time. Address in profile.",1357250131

I never really strayed from using mirc or irssi, when I'm on a desktop or have a keyboard. On my iphone, the options were pretty lacking, though. The best true IRC client for iphone is one called IRC999, in my opinion. These clients all bugged me though because when the phone would go idle or shut off the wifi, the client disconnects.<p>Sometime in early December, an idea hit me about an IRC client that would function sort of like Twitter's mobile client. It'd defer the task of maintaining the IRC connection off to a server and it'd expose an HTTP-based API for the mobile app to use.<p>Anyway, so that's what I've done. I wrote a web server / IRC client that logs chat data to a database. Specifically formatted data is exposed via HTTP so that it can be easily consumed by a mobile client. I used node.js and couchdb for these two components. I also have the basics of a iphone app. The app can be configured to point to any URL / port to use as an API.<p>These components are all open source because I think that's important. Since the server component is just an IRC client, it could be connected to BNCs like ZNC, and <i>should</i> continue to function just the same. Might need some BNC-specific commands, though.<p>I just wanted to show this and see if others thought it was a neat idea.

Actually, I bet there are already others doing the same, because code deletion in personal shell scripts probably turns out to be an unalloyed good.<p>Consider this:  you've got some script that does a sequence of operations using the standard tools.  Somewhere you change between imagemagick and graphicsmagick and some image doesn't get made thanks to syntax differences; after this you've used some clever shell filename expansion expression or regex to move/delete files, but the missing image changed your working context enough that suddenly you're in $HOME doing an rm -rf .!  The environment is just too fragile and powerful to completely automate everything you might need without setting up enough safety mechanisms, confirmations, and sanity checks to largely nullify the value of scripting as a nearly zero development programming toolchain.<p>But if shell code were trivially spec'd for pre-/post- conditions and misbehaving code gets noisily deleted (noisily so everything isn't packed away into code versioning purgatory by cascading failures when a tool like rename is accidentally uninstalled)---especially if the shell of pre-and post conditions were left around stub code...  Imagine the beauty of your scripts directory!<p>Replacing some slain block of code is trivial since the tools you need are already mostly written, and you've done something close to what you need before---plus the whole point of shell scripting is that it should be effortless and fast to produce.<p>If you've built a massive, multi-purpose utility, it deserves to live only as long as it runs flawlessly---after which, you should slice it down or replace it with an inevitably more reliable equivalent that was written for the same purpose years (or decades) ago.<p>Best of all the conditions that deleted your broken cruft even remind you exactly what you needed to do when you're re-implementing something, but often without pre-studying the entire system to ascertain what world state you are getting and what you need to produce.  Brilliant!<p>This may have started out somewhat tongue-in-cheek (since most programming environments are at least somewhat stable and feature significant error detection and recovery facilities), but I think there's some dead serious application in the quick-and-dirty, often unchecked and fluid environment of traditional shell scripting.  The more I think about it, the more I'm amazed my quarter million keystrokes of live scripts woven into my every task on my Linux desktop haven't produced more catastrophes (or any meaningful accidental data loss) or left a trail of silent failures for me to find only long after the causal bugs had manifested.",1357248537

In this case a wildcard got out for *.google.com! MITM all google.com email, sounds fun!<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but there isn't a single google webmaster tools or analytics account out there connected to the wrong domain. Why? Because to engage those services you must own the domain and have access to it.<p>Google makes you put an HTML file they generate in root or add a meta tag. They then request that URL and look for the resource.<p>If you want an SSL cert, you should have to put a file at example.com/ssl.html<p>Wildcard SSL's are trickier. My previous SSL provider charged over 100.00 per cert and that was as a reseller. They wouldn't even offer wildcards in the beginning. I believe they do now but it's a significant application process.<p>You still could require the placement of a file but that doesn't entirely prove they should get a wild cert for the domain. It still seems better than nothing and would have stopped the issuing of this particular cert.<p>Not to mention, wouldn't you think every CA or intermediate has a blacklist if domains they simply don't provide certain for? Google, Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, every major ISP, etc.<p>Or what about using DNS as a means of authentication. If you want an SSL cert you have to add a TXT record of ssl. TXT (value issuer provides). Again, in this case, they would have failed the ability to interact with google DNS and no matter what DNS server they asked would tell the same.<p>They could set up a phony DNS server, but the issuer has no reason or knowledge to follow that out of band chain. Then the only way is a rogue employee, which is something no technology is going to solve and probably will remain a risk of all business security from SSL certain to banks to brick and mortar inventory shrink.<p>All these methods are fully automatic and should be of little burden to the registrar to implement.

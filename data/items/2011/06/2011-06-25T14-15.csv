2695769,comment,2695670,2695756,2,0,Keyframe,,,"<i>I don't understand why all these professionals are upset with Apple about FCP X.</i><p>i think it's a combination of two things. First, obvious lack of pro features we need - even the basic ones. Second, Apple/FCP development/release cycles were known to be really slow and lacking in feature compared to competing products. This amplified the lackluster release that is FCPX IMO, since - I presume - lots of FCP guys felt let down by Apple, expectations were high, delivery was below low.<p><i>Do Not Upgrade(R). Stay on FCP 7.</i><p>On the other hand, people will stay on FCP7, of course. But, if you've read my post you'll remember that productions are budgeted and organized well in advance, and people are buying/will soon buy new pipelines for future products. Apple is not selling FCP7/Studio anymore, so people immediately start looking in other directions - even if they don't jump the ship right now.",1309013976

Most of it, came down to two factors:<p>1) I didn't react to taunting, teasing, name-calling, or even the occasional bits of violence. I only really had to deal with this in 8th and 9th grade, but those who would do such things figured out after a while that I wasn't going to give them any satisfaction.<p>2) My peers respected people who were good at things. I was good at things (our academic bowl team won nationals, for example, and I had several short stories published). In fact, I'd go so far as to say most people respect people who are good at things, especially if that ""good at things"" is immediate and visible and public.<p>Frankly, if schools/teachers adopted a broader view of ""success"", and if they provided a chance for students to showcase their successes in a public fashion (I'm talking actual successes here, rather than ""Congratulations!

Let's face it, writing to standards helps, but does not guarantee good cross-browser compatibility if the website is somewhat complex.<p>Also the owners/operator usually are themselves -- or have on hand -- the people that can modify the site's code right away.

2695683,comment,2694857,2695479,4,0,snprbob86,,,"""Is this too far out of scope for Graph Databases?""<p>No, it's just that ad-hoc boolean queries are better suited for other query strategies.<p>That's not to say that you couldn't use a graph database alongside another strategy. Neo4j, for example, has built in integration with Lucine. These sorts of boolean logic queries are best addressed by your typical b-tree index.<p>Note that, in general, you want to prefer relationships over attributes. Depending on the application, you'd probably have something more like this:<p><pre><code>  Node types:
    User(name, age)
    Country(name)
    Job(title)

  Relationship types:
    LivesIn()
    HasJob()
</code></pre>
To accomplish the boolean AND/OR queries, you'd store the key/value pairs from the User object from your comment in Lucine. But in the general cases of your app, you'd encode the relationships you need for particular, non-ad-hoc queries. Nodes and relationships can be used like pointers to create data structures in your graph. From there, standard algorithms generally apply.<p>""Is sorting possible at all with graph databases""<p>Often, you can completely bypass it by encoding order as a linked list. Add a relationship type: NextOldestPerson()",1309011809

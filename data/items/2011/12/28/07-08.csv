3399046,comment,3394070,3394070,1,0,codeonfire,,,"I agree that the way programming is taught needs an overhaul.  But I don't think programming should be taught at all.<p>Students should know programming before they get to college.  Do music students who go to music school all spend the first year learning guitar together?  That thinking is from the olden days when programming was a job.  Today it is an art.  The cold war refrigerators and punch cards are gone.  Here is how it should be done:\nStudents enter the school and are given a variety of starter options: game programming with python, web programming with rails, numerical computing with c, classical data structures, etc.  Then, students audition in order to take advanced courses.  The audition is two parts: technique and style.  Technique is judged on traditional things.  Did they display good class design?  Did they define a good data model?  Did they use show a high level of knowledge of whatever language they used?  Next is the style component.  Is the project ""good"".  Does it follow modern tastes in software engineering?  Does it follow modern tastes in UI design?  Is it meaningful and relevant to the world?<p>The key part is that applicants are put on notice that their entry into the real program depends on their demonstrated prior progress as programmers and CS students.  If only 10 kids show up, so be it.  That is all the students that formal education will be useful for.  Teaching programming to CS students is like teaching the greek alphabet to history students or welding to mechanical engineering students.  It's something they should already be way into, otherwise it's not really productive for anyone.  I for one am tired of seeing programmers who can't think for themselves, who can't do anything without being told the answer like a robot. They second guess everything that isn't written down and schedule endless meetings thinking someone will be show up with the answer for them.",1325058976
3399045,comment,3398643,3398783,2,0,kls,,,"You will have to forgive my cynicism on this one, but industry lobby groups usually take on a life of their own much like a Union. The problem being that the money virtually insures that once formed, the lobby will live past it's useful lifetime.<p>As well Occupy did not do much to effect regulations because those in power do not feel the pressure to change. A group of people in the street does not generate the required economic or military pressure to regulators. It raises awareness, but it does not create pressure. The Occupy movement was trying to prolong the occupation to generate that pressure, but there are superior ways to generate that pressure more rapidly. I think the people trying to organize a tax revolt would probably have a larger effect should they be able to coordinate it, at which point the powers that be would feel the real need to reign themselves in.",1325058967

You obviously can, and everyone does, to some degree.<p>But this hardly rises to the level of an incipient retail apocalypse. It isn't even new. This is nineteenth-century stuff.<p>The question is: Will differential pricing be pushed farther, now that computers are available to dynamically segment the sock market in real time? (Perhaps wool socks will cost more depending on the current local wind chill factor?) Probably. But there's a real cost in trust and goodwill and complexity that must be balanced against the advantages of differential pricing. In general, customers don't love being segmented, particularly in ways that aren't long-standing traditions (as clippable coupons are) or that don't fall along culturally accepted lines (we'll pay more for goods with famous people's names on them, or with <i>made in the USA</i> labels on them - these are just and proper activities in American culture - but we will be less pleased to pay significantly more for goods at 4pm than we do at noon, or to pay more if we're a woman than if we're a man). And so customers will tolerate only so much market segmentation before they start looking for cheaper or more transparent alternatives: Join Costco, shop Priceline, bid for the goods on eBay from a grey-market reseller, use your wife's Amazon account instead of your own, make up some fake demographic information, whatever.<p>And my hypothesis is that, if you think about pricing from the perspective of the airline industry, you're going to overestimate customer tolerance for fancy pricing games, because the airline-ticket market is constrained in unique ways that don't apply to other industries.",1325056835

Every single replacement drive failed too.  I RMAed a couple of them, and their <i>REPLACEMENTS</i> have now failed.  I believe that's a 233% failure rate, and it would probably have been higher if I hadn't given up and just bought new (non-Seagate) drives.  And before you ask - all drives were used normally in desktop machines, and they were kept cool[1].<p>I have no idea how widespread my experience was, but I've heard rumours of very high failure rates in some models of their 1TB drives.

You have yet to give a single concrete example. If anything, a human-operated vessel would have a worse reaction time than a machine-operated vessel (or AI-operated if you want to be romantic).

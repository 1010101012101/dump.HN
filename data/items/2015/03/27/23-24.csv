This is wrong, as far as I know. The proper time in the free-falling frame of reference ticks in the usual manner, and it is quite easy to compute the time it takes the object to fall inside a black hole (the textbook computation being usually done for an object which has zero velocity at infinity). The external observer on the other hand will see the falling object to slow down and the wavelength of the object&#x27;s emitted photons to be redshifted by an infinite factor as it approaches the event horizon, so the object will disappear before crossing it. This is true both for massive and massless particles falling in. Also, to nitpick: thinking about massless particles i.e. objects moving at c has having frozen time is often misleading: the &quot;usual&quot; definition of proper time, i.e. the square root of time squared minus space squared is <i>not</i> a good parametrization for light-like geodesics.",1427500748

I deliberately ignored the fact that Python merges statements & declarations in order to be able to demonstrate all four syntax classes in a single small example.<p>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s appropriate to say that declarations are &quot;executed at&quot; compile time in a statically-typed language. In SML, for example, there&#x27;s a notion of &quot;phase separation&quot; by which you can split the meaning of a program into its compile-phase and its run-phase meanings. Many declarations end up having both compile- and run-time components.

I decided that neither was the most opportune option.  &quot;The Art of Deception&quot; by Kevin Mitnick was one of my favorite books at the time, and using some of the knowledge gained from that, I found a loophole in Microsofts phone-tree that allowed me access to a high-tier representative.

9279791,comment,9278524,9278524,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Interesting article. A few thoughts:<p>The fact that Lisp does not distinguish between statements and declarations is closely tied to the fact that Lisp is very much a dynamic language (in particular, it is dynamically typed). The article uses the example of Python declaration vs. statement; but actually Python declarations are statements, too. This is typical of dynamic languages.<p>On the other hand, in a statically typed language there is necessarily a distinction between code that is executed at runtime and (although we often don&#x27;t talk about it this way) code that is executed at compile time. Declarations happen at compile time. Expressions and statements happen at runtime. The two categories almost always use very different syntax.<p>Among statically typed languages, Haskell is particularly interesting, because, while it necessarily makes a strong distinction between expressions and declarations, it has erased the distinction between expression and statement: the latter is represented by an expression that returns a list of side effects.<p>Another interesting take on this issue can be found in Daan Leijen&#x27;s Koka programming language[1]. In Koka, whether a function has side effects is part of its type. So <i>effect inference</i> can be done. The result, if I understand things correctly, is that the expression-or-statement issue becomes more than just a yes/no thing. I think these ideas are worth further exploration.<p>Lastly: an extensible pattern set. My goodness, yes. That&#x27;s the big lack I feel in Haskell; I want to define new kinds of patterns. I&#x27;ve read that F# has good support for this, but I know nothing about it; can anyone comment?<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/koka/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/koka/</a>",1427500131

Beginners face a dizzying array of resources, opinions, languages. Knowing where to look, what to google, and even how to read the documentation is a skill set that can’t be underestimated.<p>I’ve come to appreciate how far up the “literacy” ladder software development is: Basic Literacy, Digital Literacy, Computational Thinking, Programming Languages… Those of us who’ve managed to speak the language, and to do so with any degree of fluency, are a relatively rare bunch. But I don’t believe for a moment that this stuff is “hard” to learn, so much as “inaccessible,” and therefore, exclusive. I like to compare the situation we have today to the scientific community in the 17th century, when Latin was the “language of science”. What’s the language of computer science? Well it’s Greek to the lay person (even if it is Ruby). Technical fields require a precision, but the net effect of all that jargon is just as dispossessing. Add to this the fact that software itself is invisible, compiled, minified, obfuscated, socked away on some corner of the internet, hiding behind a slick GUI, turtle turtles turtles all the way down, tea cups stacked, all the way up… It’s no wonder that it’s such a struggle to learn.<p>The flip side of all of this is an odd kind of colonialism 2.0, where our technology, with our QWERTY keyboards, and ASCII character sets, and the programming language itself are all spreading the English language like smallpox.

And it has become far worse today thanks to sensationalism in the media and interested parties hyping it up. What used to be flirting, joking, and laughter around the office water cooler has now become tension and political correctness masking intrigue and malicious snarls of &quot;she&#x27;s a bitch&quot; or &quot;he&#x27;s a pig&quot;.

But I&#x27;m pretty sure that will only cover the parser combinators, which is the algorithm, but not the specifics, of how C# is parsed.<p>When I was doing C# parsing I was working with the CodeDom[5]. If you just need the AST I think ExpressionTrees[6] are now the idiomatic way to generate it, but I&#x27;m not sure how that relates to Roslyn.<p>Disclaimer: My day-to-day development switched over to primarily C/Python/JS about a year and a half ago, so it&#x27;s been a while since I fired up Visual Studio. My knowledge is probably out of date, and might be flat wrong--nobody&#x27;s memory is great after a year and a half.<p>[1] <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/hh543916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/hh543916</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals"" rel=""nofollow"">https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Fun...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals/C9-Lectures-Dr-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-8-of-13"" rel=""nofollow"">https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Fun...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y2k85ax6.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y2k85ax6.aspx</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397951.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397951.aspx</a>",1427497499

How about: I predict that if I were teleported 100 years into the future, I would have no fucking clue what was going on, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to explain it to me and I would probably die from the culture shock. You have evolve and develop and turn into the future. You can&#x27;t just go there willy-nilly, nor, at this point, can you confidently make predictions about it. That too is a prediction, though. For all I know Rudy Rucker is right and we will be a black hole in 100 years. But even if that prediction is right, our guesstimate of the phenomenology is all wrong.",1427497486

But it&#x27;s only for matching on syntax, not on ordinary values. I can&#x27;t write the fibonacci function using syntax-rules.<p>The idea behind &quot;not everything is an expression&quot; is that ordinary macros only extend the <i>expressions</i> in a language. But languages have more than expressions to them - they also have patterns, and possibly other syntax classes (loop formats, LINQ, monadic do-syntax). I think <i>those</i> syntax classes ought to be macro-extensible as well. That&#x27;s what I mean when I say that ordinary macros don&#x27;t acknowledge that not everything is an expression.<p>It&#x27;s rather a roundabout way to say it, I guess.",1427497463

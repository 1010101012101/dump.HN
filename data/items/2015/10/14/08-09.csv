I see gen X as being less willing than the boomers, too. I&#x27;m not comparing snapshots-in-time - you can&#x27;t compare 20-year-olds to 40-year-olds to 60-year-olds effectively. 20-year-old boomers were more willing to work hard than 20-year-old Xers, and in turn the Xers more than the Ys. The boomers worked less hard than the generation before them.<p>> <i>There&#x27;s no hard scientific proof in economics, but it seems like our society is more capable than ever, but the benefits are distributed more narrowly, while general wages are flat to declining, the risks individualized with lesser margins in the income, those all feel like fundamental reverses in important life areas.</i><p>See my earlier comment about perfection. Just because we&#x27;re facing challenges at the moment <i>does not mean</i> that earlier generations had it easier. When I hear the usual &quot;it&#x27;s so much harder now&quot; stuff, there&#x27;s never anything like references to things like conscription. Or the stigma of daring to be pregnant in public.

On the receiving end of a wire or network contract, how do we pick a storage type for &quot;number&quot;? We can&#x27;t because the constraints of the type are undefined. Ergo JSON schema isn&#x27;t a strong schema language. <i>Be explicit</i> is really important when defining contracts.<p>Type this in your address bar for an illustration:<p><pre><code>    javascript:alert(1.0000000000000000000000000000001);\n</code></pre>\nSo where can we go here. Yep:<p><pre><code>   { number: &quot;1.0000000000000000000000000000001&quot; }\n</code></pre>\nwhich means we then break the encapsulation boundary of the metadata.

Possibly regionally specific, but in London, a ticket to a big-ticket repertoire symphony with the LSO or whatever can be had for about £10, and a pretty nice seat for £25-30, which is about what I paid to see Nile and Suffocation, surely more niche than Mahler, and probably half what you need to see a big pop act. (Opera is eye-gougingly expensive, though.) The orchestra dresses formally, the audience doesn&#x27;t (unless they want to). Silence between movements is observed, however, which sort of freaks me out.<p>I&#x27;m ambivalent about the video game music thing, simply because what works in one setting doesn&#x27;t necessarily work in another. A game score&#x27;s primary virtue is to withstand repetition and respond to non-deterministic events (which may be a more interesting way to approach a VGM concert than just a tour of Final Fantasy&#x27;s &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; or whatever; certainly there are precedents in the post-war avant garde for that kind of thing). A symphony proper is designed ground-up for the sort of setting in which you are likely to hear it - an acoustically-tuned concert hall, with a highly-trained band of musicians extracting every bit of dynamic range and expressive potential out of their instruments. There&#x27;s nothing quite like it when it works (there is also nothing quite like, since I&#x27;ve mentioned it, death metal, or techno, or ...)<p>The problem with &#x27;high-culture&#x27; institutions going for populism is that it can be done in a really shallow, instrumentalist way: the VGM concert as the loss leader for Schoenberg frankly isn&#x27;t going to do any favours to the VGM. It has to be treated seriously, or it won&#x27;t even be fun - not used as a gateway drug for what the orchestra/concert hall <i>really</i> wants you to listen to.",1444811872

It means that if you apply a function to each element of the structure, you cannot change the shape of the structure.<p>This structure preserving property means you can safely apply any function (even ones you don&#x27;t know what they do) and you can be safe you&#x27;re not losing information beyond what the function takes away.<p>> It should possibly be renamed to Container or Mappable to be more in line with what general developers expect.<p>Mappable would be a truthful name. Container is not a good name because far from all Functors are containers. You can map over a lot of things (I/O actions, functions among others) which are not intuitively &quot;containers&quot;, unless you revise your intuition of &quot;container&quot; to mean &quot;mappable&quot;. :)<p>The good thing about calling it for what it is – Functor – is an argument commonly lifted by Edward Kmett: when you&#x27;re honest about what you&#x27;re dealing with, you instantly give people access to 80 years of collective knowledge about the thing.",1444810595

When the vast majority of them read that section of Paul&#x27;s letter to the church at Ephesus (Paul mainly wrote letters, and they weren&#x27;t divided up into chapters/verses for reference until much later) the key takeaway for them is &quot;I, as a Christian, am commanded to give up my rights for the sake of my spouse and our marriage.&quot;<p>In doing this, I think most people assume that Christians simply pretend they don&#x27;t want what they really want, and pretend they do want what they really don&#x27;t want.  That&#x27;s not it at all, and that&#x27;s merely a recipe for a hollow, hypocritical relationship.<p>There are certainly differences amongst Christians, and I don&#x27;t intend to paper over them.

It&#x27;s like a test suite for a program, which ensures that the end result works regardless of how well you write code (ignoring the maintenance and readability problems for a moment here). Whichever way you come up with a sound, it&#x27;s your ear that will or will not allow it to pass through.<p>Some particular creative tactics can help, thoughby providing more diverse, unexpected input, and/or optimizing for quicker iteration (allowing to test more variations in less time).

6194155,comment,6194023,6194023,17,0,fiatmoney,,,"It&#x27;s not a terrible idea to support the absolute basics like mean & variance, but anything beyond that (particularly things like models or tests) is not a good idea for a standard library.  Once you hit even something simple like a linear regression you have issues of how to represent missing or discrete variables, handling colinearity, or whether to do online or batch modes which can give different results.  Tests in particular are fraught because if you&#x27;re going to make them available for general consumption they need a good explanation of when they&#x27;re appropriate, which is basically a semester course in statistics and well out of scope for standard library docs.<p>Basically, the idea of &quot;batteries included&quot; should also mean that if something looks like you can put a D-cell in there, you&#x27;re unlikely to blow your arm off.",1376204225

It&#x27;s a sort of uncanny valley thing that manifests itself likewise in the common discussion of whether something feels &quot;native&quot;, or whether you should use the OS-provided UI elements vs. re-invent the wheel when writing an app. For instance QT apps on OS X.<p>It&#x27;s better to either do an exact copy or to be different enough that you don&#x27;t invite comparison, otherwise what you&#x27;ve come up with will always look like an inferior copy of the original.

It&#x27;s great from a performance point of view, but horrible for compatibility.<p>Google App Engine used to suffer because of this (more specifically, it still only restricts your runtime to pure Python, but now you can import numpy at least).  I believe the PyPy folks have also had their own set of struggles with numpy compatibility, although I&#x27;m not sure what the state of that is at present.<p>In any case, I think these compatibility concerns alone make a strong argument for including simple Statistics tooling into the standard library.",1376204128

Easier to use something like Mongrel2 as the webserver with Python multiprocessing backend to leverage the UNIX/Linux process model. Or to use something like Akka on the JVM along with spray.io. Or use Clojure, again on the JVM.<p>But remember, one of the benefits of using event-based design is that you can write your event processors in different languages if it makes sense.

After all, if you prove that factorization cannot be done in polynomial time, then a corollary of this result is that P != NP.<p>Intuitively, NP-hard problems are <i>believed</i> to be harder than factorization and discrete log. And so it should be easier to <i>prove</i> that an NP-hard problem is not in P.<p>What you are referring to is the opposite direction of the implication, which is very relevant in a discussion of why people have failed to find faster algorithms for integer factorization. However, the question I replied to is essentially why people have failed to prove that integer factorization (and discrete log) are hard problems.<p><i>Edit</i>: After re-reading my previous comment, perhaps this clarifies it best: Integer factorization and discrete log are probably less hard than NP-hard problems. However, the meta-problem &quot;prove that integer factorization or discrete log is really, unconditionally hard&quot; is at least as difficult as the meta-problem &quot;prove P != NP&quot;.",1376203707

6194058,comment,6193148,6194022,33,0,aroman,,,"As a matter of fact, I wrote that very program, Switchboard.<p>It&#x27;s getting late and I don&#x27;t want to write a whole book about  it&#x27;s design (though I could), but basically here&#x27;s the story:<p>I saw some mockups Daniel Fore (the project&#x27;s founder and lead designer) created for a hypothetical system settings app. Here&#x27;s an example: <a href=""http://danrabbit.deviantart.com/art/User-Accounts-Plug-198608643"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danrabbit.deviantart.com/art/User-Accounts-Plug-19860...</a><p>I set about coding the app. I was painfully aware of the visual similarities between OS X and Switchboard. I spent literally MONTHS wracking my brain trying to find a better design which was as elegant and efficient. I argued with Dan (who had created a mockup which would become the main interface for switchboard, which you linked), I talked to other designers, I mocked things up by hand. And I/we came up with some really creative alternatives which looked very little like System Preferences in OS X.<p>In the end however, I was faced with an ultimatum. Do I change the settings app JUST to look different than OS X, and lose out on the well-established excellence of Apple&#x27;s design?<p>I truly felt awful about having to face that question. Frankly, it made me upset and depressed for quite a bit. Ultimately however, I was convinced and just said &quot;screw it&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right that I&#x27;m not the first one to &quot;copy&quot; Apple&#x27;s settings program. Here&#x27;s Ubuntu&#x27;s. It&#x27;s extremely similar to the two ones you linked: <a href=""http://zeth.net/archive/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ubuntu1110-2-settings.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zeth.net/archive/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ubuntu111...</a><p>You could say that I failed. You could say I failed to come up with a better interface. And in that sense, I did. But I get extremely frustrated when people dismiss the product of my careful investigation and thought into this matter as &quot;oh, he just wholesale copied OS X&quot;. Because it ignores the fact that I really tried to come up with a better solution.<p>In the end I couldn&#x27;t, and it seems nobody else has either.<p>I will say though, I did really try to innovate on the technical side. And in that sense, I think I succeeded. You can see that in some of Switchboard&#x27;s finer points, such as exposing APIs to the settings panes (which are called Switchboard &quot;plugs&quot;) which allow them to actually interact with Switchboard&#x27;s internal UI, providing, among other things, progress bar support in the title bar.<p>I wrote an article for the elementary Journal announcing Switchboard here: <a href=""http://elementaryos.org/journal/attack-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elementaryos.org/journal/attack-settings</a><p>And I put together a quick presentation highlighting Switchboard&#x27;s vision and architecture here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF37THZoNsA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF37THZoNsA</a> |  <a href=""https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0Aah2wnTpXrZAZGRuaDI4bmdfNWYyOWpzN2Rm&hl=en_US"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0Aah2wnTpXrZAZGRuaDI...</a><p>Hopefully, you can see that we did not just &quot;senselessly copy&quot; anything.",1376201885

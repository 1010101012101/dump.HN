48676,comment,48553,48673,0,0,kingnothing,,,"I agree with the first two paragraphs, but not the rest of it. Somewhere in US history, things changed. The average American is clearly accepting, if not loving, of Walmart and other big companies, otherwise they would not be the juggernauts they are today. There would not be over 3800 Walmarts in the USA alone if we loved small and hated big. ",1188556382

48674,comment,48642,48642,0,0,dood,,,"Pylons is deserving of attention. There is a small comparison of Django and Pylons here [<a href=""http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscookbook/Concepts+of+Pylons#ConceptsofPylons-Arethereotherwebframeworks%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscookbook/Concepts+of+...</a>]. <p>I'm playing around with Pylons and have been impressed so far. The whole approach strikes me as more of a hackers framework; less magic, more flexible, extensible. Though the docs need a little work, and the community isn't as big as Django yet, Pylons seems to be blossoming into quite an excellent framework.",1188555786
48673,comment,48553,48553,0,0,uuilly,,,"American's love David and Europeans love Goliath.  <p>The British believed in their Empire.  They believed that it was right to put Squash courts and Polo fields in far flung countries.  They believed that Britishness was the most natural state of man.  The French, Russians and eventually the Germans felt the same way about themselves, only more so and less sucessfully.  These empires were Goliaths and their people were proud of them.  <p>The US was the first major colony to successfully break free from the Brits.  The most formidable military force ever deployed sailed into the East River and bore down on a bunch of un-uniformed barefoot rabble representing our (at that time) pathetic revolution.  Yet somehow we won.  That picture was chopped up and burned into the DNA of every American.  We re-live it when Bruce Willis crawls through air-ducts and elevator shafts to outwit German terrorists.  And again when he leads his band of blue collar drillers to blow up a merciless asteriod.  And his goals are simple too.  Bruce just wants to get home in time for dinner whereas James Bond is ""keeping the British end up.""  Americans are wary of higher causes which makes them distrust things bigger than themselves.<p>It's everywhere in this country, Big is bad and small is good.  We hate Wallmart, Microsoft, Nike and Exxon.  Nevermind that Target, Adobe, Reebok and Shell are doing the exact same thing as their bigger counterparts.  They're not big so we can't hate them.  The only thing that will ""kill"" Google (IBM / MS style) will be bigness.  We will turn against them once they become Goliath.  <p>Our people (formerly your people) banded together way back then and forged our ideals in violent reaction against bigness.  And so it's been ever since.  We were the 12th biggest army just before WWII and few thought we would outlast the Soviets.  But once the Soviet Empire fell we became Goliath and we have hated ourselves ever since.  The Brits and Russians in their prime would have no problem with Iraq.  The Russians would roll in and kill everyone and the Brits would pit the Sunnis against the Shias and colonize what's left.  We have gone in half cocked and we don't truely believe that it's our place to tell other people how to live.  It is cruely ironic that we may have to sail back across the pond and ask our British cousins how we can best play the part of Goliath.  <p>This is all a long way of saying that revering startups is just natural to us.  It's what we've always done and for better or worse, it's all we know.  I'm actually not sure why they were ever called startups.  Upstarts is way more fitting...",1188555778
48672,comment,48553,48553,0,0,kingnothing,,,"I believe another part of it has to do with the cost of incorporation. In most places in the US, you can do it yourself for under $100. Comparatively, in most of Europe, it costs between $2,000 and $10,000 to form a company.<p>Also, with America's long standing tradition of entrepreneurship comes easy money for financing a new venture. In Europe, the spirit isn't there so to speak, so I assume the money would likewise be harder to come by. <p>I don't know anything about European law. Are companies in Europe afforded the same rights as in the US?",1188555683

48666,comment,47549,48661,0,0,portLAN,,,"> <i>Still, it's too much to call their decision making progress a whim, because there is much more to it than completely arbitrary choice.</i><p>I didn't say the process was <i>completely</i> arbitrary or <i>only</i> whim.  I said not to leave your fate up to someone else's whim -- which is probably what it comes down to for the group of ""maybes"".  Whim is generally the make-it-or-break-it deciding factor.  And when there are more unknowns -- as with applicants who lack experience, or lack a demo -- it plays an increasingly larger role.<p>> <i>I wish they devoted more time to the decision making process, because I remain convinced that our outcome with YC would have been much different with a 1 hour interview instead of a 15 minute interview.</i><p>You're essentially saying now that YC lacked solid reasons for making their decision because the process is too brief.  I agree.  They don't have that much information, and they don't spend that much time on it.  They make a call one way or the other and then go on to the next applicant.<p>> <i>The seedcamp interview process is orders of magnitude better and more fair from a founder's perspective.</i><p>Which is to say, it is less based on whim than YC.<p>Edit: And one more thing -- your chances are always better if they like you <i>personally</i>, and almost always zero if they don't.  That is why whim plays a big part in any human relationship, and investing is no exception.  If they like you enough, that is often all it takes.  I've heard and read interviews with VCs that go like this: <i>I didn't understand what they were talking about, but I didn't care, I said, ""I like you guys, here's some money, now go build it.""</i><p>",1188554525

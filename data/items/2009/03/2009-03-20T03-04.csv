524483,comment,524348,524351,0,0,soundsop,,,"Other people have answered what the resistance does (create a voltage divider that feeds a voltage to the A/D converter), so I'll describe ways to select the resistance value.<p>There are several specifications that might have to be met:<p><pre><code>  * Power delivery limit of the energy source
  * Current specification for optimal operation of the thermistor
  * Voltage level of the A/D input
</code></pre>
The resistance value might be completely constrained by one of these requirements or, in tougher cases, might be constrained by more than one requirement (often in different directions).<p>For example, if the thermistor has an effective resistance of about 1kOhm and requires a current of about 1mA, then you need to set the resistor to 4kOhm (assuming the A/D input draws negligible current). If this is the case, you're stuck on the other requirements. Your power consumption will be 5mW (5Vx1mA) and the nominal level of the A/D converter input will be about 4V (5Vx4k/(1k+4k)).<p>Experienced circuit designers seem to magically come up with correct values because they are familiar with typical requirements and can quickly identify the limiting specification. You'll have to struggle a bit at the beginning to get the hang of it.",1237521364

I&#x27;ve learned a lot from it .<p>If I understand correctly, it is for enterprise search, not for web search, correct?<p>The response time is really impressive, especially with the new sorting by date function. To me, using NoSQL database, it&#x27;s hard to do sorting if it&#x27;s not impossible. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not available in the initial current release.<p>This implementation reminded me about the CTF algorithm, which needs to match the input query against a file. The reason why I thought it&#x27;s not for large volumes of queries is because:<p>1. Each keystroke is a AJAX call which could be lightening fast when the query volume is low. But JavaScript could run slow on mobile phones. In this case probably it&#x27;s not too bad because the AJAX call is very simple, fetch the results from the server<p>2. After receiving the request, on server side, there are only three steps to go before the results are returned:<p>- Initialized a new index (actually it&#x27;s not a new index, just a new search)<p>- set criteria for the order of the attributes sets<p>- Call search and return<p>Of course, there are more detailed steps under the search api. The majority of the work is done on the search engine server side to keep crawling and updating the indexes.<p>When the request volume becomes huge, the real time response may be slow down due to the file size.<p>I appreciate this tool to help me find things quickly on HN.",1390795044

7128688,comment,7126242,7127373,1,0,sshumaker,,,"This policy varies on a team-by-team basis, but generally Google is pretty good about giving people some flexibility in this regard. It&#x27;s pretty common to see people work from home because they e.g. have a dentist appointment in the middle of the afternoon or something. We generally treat people as responsible adults unless they give us a reason to otherwise.<p>That said, we really value the team-building and communication that happens when everyone is in one place, and that typically means WFW (work from work) the majority of the time, so we try not to make a habit of WFH.<p>This is kinda the same issue with remote work. We have great videoconferencing tech, but we generally find that you miss out a lot when you&#x27;re apart from the rest of the team. This makes even being on a geographically distributed team kinda difficult.

He also suggested that Xerox tried to bring in Jobs, when it seems to have been Apple who made the approach (at the instigation of Jef Raskin at Apple). <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6SUOeAqOjU#t=2m15s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6SUOeAqOjU#t=2m15s</a> is misleading. PARC was more-or-less forbidden to buy a DEC PDP-10, which would have reflected badly on the competing machines from Xerox&#x27;s new acquisition Scientific Data Systems, so PARC built a PDP-10 clone (the MAXC) in-house for their own use. That had very little to do with why they later designed and built the Altos: there was nothing remotely similar to an Alto out there that they could have bought (Nelson knows this).",1390794806

7128663,comment,7126605,7128183,1,0,spikels,,,"No need to apologize. I agree the PPP basket weights is a problem without a perfect solution but I has been studied extensively. My understanding is that most experts don&#x27;t think it is a huge problem. I think most people would agree that Denmark is more expensive that the US but we can certainly argue about how much more expensive[1].<p>I&#x27;m not expert in the details of either GDP or PPP calculations but here is my understanding of how parental leave would be treated. It would show up in GDP because wages are included under the &quot;income approach&quot;, one of the three main approaches used. I don&#x27;t believe it would directly show up in PPP as it is not a good or service that people buy. I don&#x27;t think is means anything to say parental leave is less or more expensive.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t think it would have a big impact as there only about 50,000 births every year in Denmark in a population of 5.5 million. So if they max out the benefit it is only 25,000/5,500,000 = 0.45%. This is a good example why GDP and PPP work in practice - all these random errors tend to cancel out.<p>If you are interested I suggest you read up on how GDP is calculated.

Chang’s column, entitled “China Halts Bank Transfers,” specifically refers to Citibank’s Chinese branches. The report is entirely misleading.” Our advice – focus on the real “weakest links” in China’s banking system, of which there are many and are backed by facts, not the least of which is the potential upcoming shadow banking default.

There&#x27;s more detail in Derek Thompson&#x27;s article [1] with maps for both &quot;absolute upward mobility&quot; and &quot;relative mobility&quot; measures. Even though it uses national income rankings as a base, the &quot;relative mobility&quot; measure compares outcomes between people growing up in the same commuting zones. That should exclude the affect of differing regional incomes. It&#x27;s broadly similar, but more variation is visible in the South than in the other maps.<p>Area income seems to offer a compelling explanation for one local result highlighted in the paper [2]:<p>&quot;San Francisco has substantially higher relative mobility than Chicago: y ̄100 − y ̄0 = 25.0 in San Francisco vs. y ̄100 − y ̄0 = 39.3 in Chicago. But part of the greater relative mobility in San Francisco comes from worse outcomes for children from high-income families. Below the 60th percentile, children in San Francisco have better outcomes than those in Chicago; above the 60th percentile, the reverse is true.&quot;<p>Someone on a >60th national income percentile in San Francisco is going to be in a much lower local income percentile. That would make them relatively disadvantaged in comparison to someone on a >60th national income percentile in Chicago. And if they leave the city for somewhere with a lower cost of living, even if they stay in the same local income bracket as their parents they will appear to be doing worse in terms of national income ranking.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-geography-of-the-american-dream/283308/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-geog...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/mobility_geo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/mobility_geo.pdf</a>",1390791780

8535453,comment,8533284,8534434,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> <i>library version change affects both primary components</i><p>In my experience, it changes neither, because the interface of the library just doesn&#x27;t change.  Of course it depends where you make the separation.  Basically, if the interface to your library is big, you either suck at API design, or you traced the wrong boundary.<p>Now if you happen to only need a small fraction of a sizeable library, I can only suspect the library itself fell prey to scope creep.  If there&#x27;s no way to import what you need, and little more, that probably indicates a problem with the library itself.<p>Even big libraries which by nature must make many different things can often be separated into different components. Like the SDL for instance.<p>---<p>Oh, and I was assuming we were talking about <i>internal</i> dependencies.  Like, <i>you</i> write the library which will then be used in different parts of your (possibly big) project. That&#x27;s very different from external dependencies, which are generally bigger, harder to freeze <i>and</i> harder to update.",1414699165

Old testament teachings such as practicing iconoclasm, have been a regular feature of many Christian denominations.

USPS completely depends on bulk shipping and they&#x27;ll happily provide product packaging at all scales - down to the carrier route level.  Urban areas get hit pretty bad, due to population density - bulk shippers get more bang for the buck.  Ideally, from the postal customer&#x27;s perspective, shipping costs would rise for shippers who can only address shipments to &quot;Current resident of:&quot; or &quot;Our friend at:&quot;.

8535389,comment,8520954,8530452,0,0,glennsl,,,"Happy to oblige. I will have to skip a lot of reasoning and contingencies for brevity&#x27;s sake, but I hope it gives you an idea of what a basic income might actually mean at least.<p>So first of all, a basic income would be a lot more transformative to society than it would seem at first glance. It&#x27;s not just about people getting more money to spend. Crime would go down, peoples health would improve and we would trust each other much more since there&#x27;s much less reason to lie and cheat just to get by (which is considered a major factor in the success of the Scandinavian model.) We&#x27;d need less police, less health care, and insurance costs would go down. And of course the entire means-testing bureaucracy would be unnecessary.<p>Then there&#x27;s the labour market. Not being required to hold a job, and the increased bargaining power that entails, could lead to a number of different outcomes that are sometimes hard to predict. Shitty jobs would either become less shitty, pay better (which of course makes it more expensive for the employer), or get automated if it&#x27;s cost-effective. As would jobs individually considered harmful, meaningless or counter-productive, like the military, weapons manufacturing, telemarkting and advertising, to name a few. People would likely get a lot more educated, and the education system would hopefully transform from being a production line of worker drones to actually encouraging curiosity and learning. Innovation would flourish, since anyone could just go out and do their own thing without risking homelessness. Cooperatives would be much more prevalent. &quot;Good&quot; jobs might pay less, since there would be a lot more well-educated labour available.<p>But here&#x27;s the kicker: when having a job is no longer essential, there&#x27;s no reason to artificially create jobs. We could stop encouraging consumerism and infinite growth, and institute policies that are untouchable today because they remove jobs or hinder job creation. Which would cause people to spend more time and energy on what they really want to do, things that actually matter, rather than hoarding stuff. Many would work less, others more, because they&#x27;re able to do work they enjoy and don&#x27;t have to do it primarily for material gains. Those with small children or elderly parents could spend more time taking care of them themselves, instead of shipping them off to some institution or other.<p>A lot of work that&#x27;s good but difficult or impossible to monetize, that currently need to be supported by advertising or  considered  charity, could actually be done full-time without having to spend your time fundraising or degrading your work with advertisements. It could be done part-time alongside a part-time job for some extra spending money, or on a break from your ordinary job. I think we&#x27;d see a huge increase in political activism, journalism, and a transformation in how democracy would work in general. Finally, if we got rid of copyright, the production of creative works would be included in this category, and while not very likely, it would be possible to produce something like Game of Thrones without a single cent of funding.<p>If all that waste and abuse could be eliminated, or significantly reduced, it would reduce cost at every step of the production chain. Profit margins, and therefore prices, would be kept down unless for some reason competition decreases. Prices might even be lowered further if there&#x27;s less manipulative marketing creating artificial demand. Skilled labour might be cheaper because there&#x27;s more of it available, and if it&#x27;s something people really want to work on I believe they&#x27;d care less about the paycheck and more about doing what the want to do.",1414698613

8535380,comment,8533025,8534505,0,0,joshstrange,,,"I was using Sync as recently as last month. I just opened the iPhone app and it looks like now you can add a folder but not sync the data to your phone which is a huge improvement however the iPhone app is still a steaming pile of shit IMHO. It froze up on me 3 times while I was trying to browser through my non-synced folder and I had to force quit (iPhone 6+ no other apps running).<p>Also I find the web/app interfaces to BTSync to be extremely laggy or contain stale data. On my MBPr (late 2013) it took a little over a minute to launch (well it &quot;launched&quot; right away but the web interface showed a loading screen for a minute, I have ONE folder synced) and the UX is terrible. I&#x27;ll click something and a few seconds later it will open, I&#x27;m constantly wondering if the click registered or if BTSync is just being slow. In my experience the web/app does not seem to save my settings on which columns to show which is quite irritating. Lastly as I mentioned above trying to have BTSync sync 300+ folders brought it to it&#x27;s knees and I can&#x27;t even load the web interface to remove folders so that it&#x27;s usable again (On my Ubuntu media center).<p>As for the API key there is NO VALID REASON why I should need an API key to access something I host myself, none. Period. Exclamation point. I had to apply for an API key before I could start scripting BTSync and the first thing I did with scripting was to add all my media folders for shows to BTSync and it fell over and died. If you just want to sync a handful of folders it might work fine for you but when it brings my beefy media center to it&#x27;s knees something is really wrong. Another gripe I have is the documentation for BTSync is woefully out of date and flat out incorrect in some cases. Once you manage to get an API key there are no instruction on what you do with said API key. Do you add it to each request to the BTSync API? No, you actually put it in a config file for BTSync itself which I only found out after scouring the internet and BTSync forums for help.<p>BTSync has failed me multiple times and I&#x27;m done wasting my time with it. I&#x27;m glad it works for your but trying to use it for ~10TB of data is pipedream. To be fair Syncthing (Pulse) may be no better but I already like them more because they are more open whereas BTSync feels like a bait and switch waiting to happen IMHO.",1414698514

It is difficult to predict what the free market would make of this situation since we are currently so far from the free-market model. Here are a few stabs at looking in my crystal ball.<p>* Minimum wage laws pressure companies to cut benefits such as this.<p>* Many laws and regulations make it more difficult to start your own business. In a free market, having more small business owners would even the playing field and make benefits like this more common.<p>* When businesses no longer have terrible laws like the FMLA to serve as a reference for their time off policies, more would craft their policy based on attracting and retaining talent. Businesses that do so naturally are more likely to succeed and will crowd others out of the market.<p>* Since people can&#x27;t rely on a government for their own welfare in a free market, they would be more proactively aware of time off policies when taking a new job, thus creating a natural pressure for better  policies.<p>* Since businesses wouldn&#x27;t have the &quot;We&#x27;re completely compliant with federal regulations&quot; cop-out, more outcry may result from stories like the OP because these policies are actually counter-productive to business.<p>But in the end none of that really matters in the free-market debate. Either you <i>do</i> have the right to use force against people who are honoring a mutually agreed contract, or you don&#x27;t.

You&#x27;re stretching a line between two distant things in hopes of having a nice neat world of bigots on one side, and everyone else on the other. &quot;You&#x27;re either with us, or you&#x27;re with the bigots&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not, I assure you.  Especially when your subsequent example is:<p>> In your world, I&#x27;m a bigot because I HATE that overly-camp, sledge-hammer decorative approach with men in g-strings running around in heels and pink fluffy decorations everywhere and don&#x27;t forget the awful gay dance music. That&#x27;s what it is to be gay? I don&#x27;t think so. The mardi gras (at least the one where I live) needs to die. But I can&#x27;t say that because I&#x27;ll be &quot;anti-gay&quot;. I&#x27;m not anti-gay, I just hate the annual celebration of the &quot;gay community&quot; by erecting giant penises on floats and broadcasting it all on live TV.<p>You&#x27;re entitled to that belief.  It doesn&#x27;t (necessarily) make you a bigot.  Lots of people hate annoying parades - I myself found myself trapped a few months back trying to get across 5th avenue while the gay pride parade was going on and was incredibly annoyed.<p>So there we go - we share a common ground of annoyance towards loud, over-the-top parades.<p>But I presume that if another group had a similar parade, you&#x27;d be equally annoyed - that it&#x27;s not the fact that it&#x27;s gay people having the parade, it&#x27;s the fact the parade is loud, decadent, over the top, with awful dance music (and giant penises on floats).<p>That&#x27;s what makes it different than the example I gave.  Your example (annoying, over the top parades with penis floats) is more akin to people who are against marriage entirely - they don&#x27;t want <i>anyone</i> to get married, gay, straight, black, white, whoever.  That&#x27;s a position I can respect, even if I don&#x27;t agree with it, because it&#x27;s at least equally applied.<p>Gay marriage, though, is a situation where you have one group of people having a bigger, broader set of rights than the other group of people.  That&#x27;s a bigoted view of the world - for some reason these people over here <i>can</i> get married, but these other people over here <i>can&#x27;t</i>.<p>If we were to apply it to your example, if you were only annoyed at the mardi gras because there were gay people involved - if straight people, puerto ricans, professional basketball players, whoever, threw the <i>exact same</i> parade and you were fine with it, then you&#x27;d be bigoted.<p>I&#x27;m all about a level playing field.  Either everyone gets to get married, or no one does.  Either everyone gets to have a loud, annoying parade with giant penis floats, or no one should.<p>Your example just doesn&#x27;t apply here.  I&#x27;m not dividing the world into neat examples of bigots and not, because people can have a broad range of emotions about a wide variety of things. And certainly, you can dislike aspects of gay culture without being bigoted as long as you&#x27;d dislike those aspects if they were present in other cultures.  But when you single out one specific group as having diminished rights compared to the others, that&#x27;s some level of bigotry for sure.",1414697901

judgment of Dr. Michael Cole from the University of Illinois, EPA found that between 4 to 20 percent of the carbon in compost degrades very quickly, and the remainder can be considered either slow or
passive. Dr. Cole found 400 years to be the average of the reported sequestration times of carbon in the
soil.&quot;<p>Elsewhere they mention that the carbon content of wet compost is about 20%.  Again, so while the conversion is not perfect, is there dispute that composting green materials and adding the compost to the soil results in net CO2 sequestration?",1414697044

On a macroscopic level across all time-frames, clearly the carbon cycle is basically closed, so the amount respired out by the litter is the same amount as in.  On a more local level, we may now have a lower-than-usual amount of carbon in the soil, as modern agricultural techniques and deforestation may have released more carbon from the soil than usual.<p>Empirical results seem to confirm the intuition that woods and such sequester carbon longer than quicker-decaying substances, and indeed how could they not?<p>So as a very, very rough rule of thumb, I&#x27;d say that you&#x27;d expect a fast-growing plant to sequester carbon for roughly 2-3x its lifespan (and of course some of that is carbon release happens quickly and some more slowly).",1414696917

8535172,comment,8533907,8533907,0,0,throwawayay,,,"> Most of my colleagues spend a lot of hours at the office--usually at least 12hr days.<p>I have coworkers and friends that do exactly what you&#x27;re describing, and I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d tell you they do it, but I have my own theories about why it would be rational to work long hours for no additional pay.<p>First, why working long hours seems effective:<p>- Showing up at the office isn&#x27;t really work.  I think Woody Allen once said &quot;80% of success is showing up&quot;.  When you&#x27;re present all the time, people tend to think that you&#x27;re more important, more useful, and more reliable.  I work from home often, and I can certainly feel my importance in the company diminishing, even though the quality and speed of my work has never been higher.  Humans seem to highly value grunting at other humans face to face.  If I wanted to move up in the company, I would absolutely have my face seen as much as possible, and a good way to do that is to be there for long hours.  Besides, it&#x27;s not that hard to be &quot;working long hours&quot; while actually reading the internet for most of the day, which is what a lot of people would be doing at home after work anyway.<p>- Hours are also an objective measurement, while performance is often very subjective.  The biggest complaint that I hear from other employees about other employees is that someone isn&#x27;t looking busy enough or was barely in the office at all.  If someone produces shitty output, it can be rationalized if the person is friendly and appears motivated, because we love people who are trying hard at anything.  If someone gets all their work done and leaves early, they don&#x27;t look like a team player and people get jealous and resentful.  I think it&#x27;s a common human response.  For office politics, which often determines salary and promotions, it often makes more sense to be there for long hours than it does to produce amazing output.  People love a martyr.<p>Some reasons you might choose to put in long hours at a startup or small company with poor benefits and salary, instead of a BigCo with higher pay and better benefits:<p>- You can gain rank very quickly in a startup.  As a programmer, the best I can really do as an employee is either become a &quot;lead&quot; or move toward management and try to become a startup CTO.  I don&#x27;t personally find this to have a lot of value, but I do think it&#x27;s common for people to work in a startup for a year or two, get some fancy title and be able to claim credit for a lot of things, then apply to other companies and try to enter at a higher level.  In a growing startup, you don&#x27;t have that many stakeholders to convince of your value, and if showing up is an influential factor in your promotions, then it could be rational to spend lots of hours at work.  I&#x27;ve seen high-hour-low-output programmers transition to higher levels of management, obtained mostly through long hours, which they will probably keep them at the same level in their next job.  If you&#x27;ve ever encountered a bullshitter that adds no value but seems to have great credentials, then long hours might have been a factor in how they got there.<p>- Similarly, other coworkers have transitioned to other teams, instantly giving them years of &quot;experience&quot; on their resumes.  Late nights in the office helped show the dedication and build enough trust to make that transition without actually being qualified for the new position.<p>- I know others that would never get hired at a BigCo, especially as a programmer, but by staying at a startup and looking valuable with long days, they get many more years of experience, more paychecks, a bigger social network, and a pathway into management.  For people in this position, long hours are a good way to appear to be contributing without actually having to perform that well.<p>- It&#x27;s easy to be misinformed about the value of equity, especially if the founders have done a good job of selling the idea of everyone getting rich if the company succeeds.  Thinking of yourself as an owner makes it easier to justify working longer hours.<p>- If someone has an interest in learning a new skill, working late nights could be looked at as continuing education that also gets you paid.  I&#x27;d certainly have learned more working for free at a company than I did in years of university, and I put a lot of hours into university work.  A company can also be a useful structure to get help and to grow skills, especially if you&#x27;re under-skilled for your position.<p>- A lot of people genuinely do want to give their all to something.  This makes sense to me too, because some people certainly do find a sort of bliss in life-enveloping levels of work and discipline.  I think people tend to view this as an artist thing or an obsessive entrepreneurial thing.  If you can find a deep sense of purpose in your daily job that would make you want to work long hours, that probably feels just as rewarding to some people as creating that environment on their own, with less personal financial risk (and of course, less gain).<p>> If you love hacking, why not keep bank hours at the office and work on your own projects outside of that?<p>I do exactly that.  I work at an app startup, but I keep them limited to about 8 hours a day (well, 7, if you count lunch).  I believe I provide good value for the company, at least relative to the other talent they&#x27;re able to attract.  I find being in an office to be very mentally draining, so I try to work from home (which would be much harder at a BigCo), so I&#x27;m not burned out by the end of the day.<p>When I&#x27;m done with work, at least a few days a week, I hack on projects at night.  I&#x27;ve learned so much more in my time outside of work than at work, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the arrangement.  I&#x27;ll be releasing an app that I&#x27;ve made using this approach pretty soon.  If I can make an extra $40k/year from my part-time app development, I&#x27;m still ahead of what I could get at a BigCo, and I&#x27;m closer to my dream of going indie.",1414696546

The author would ban these commenters.  His theory was that people are entitled to debate those topics somewhere, but that he wanted to have productive discussions on his blog with people who shared his basic premises.<p>It&#x27;s easy for me see two different points of view about this: that it creates a &quot;filter bubble&quot; of the sort described by Eli Pariser, where the Orthodox (and people with other beliefs, for that matter, in their own blog communities) never see their faith questioned, and have a subjective experience that their beliefs are &quot;normal&quot; and don&#x27;t hear about the substance of criticisms or objections to them.  Or that it actually allows discussions about the topics that the audience of that blog mainly wants to discuss, without having <i>every single thread</i> turn into a debate about the existence of God, whether the Torah is divine, and whether Orthodoxy should adopt gender egalitarianism.<p>I think one idea here is that Twitter only makes one of these two options practical: the one where <i>every</i> thread can conceivably go off in the direction of a bunch of strangers saying that your basic beliefs are wrong (or even that you are a bad person).",1414696424

As far as most people I meet are concerned, I have a very weird accent; the perception ranges from &quot;he&#x27;s Scottish&quot; to &quot;what the hell?&quot; depending on where I go and who I talk to. In any case, while phonology is clearly very important, I would argue that it is not completely necessary for expressing yourself properly, at least in writing.<p>> <i>&quot;[...] another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task on which most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.&quot;</i><p>This is sadly very true, though I honestly don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a silver bullet when it comes to learning vocabulary. One additional source I would add to your &quot;royal road to learning vocabulary&quot; would be exposure to colloquial language, or slang at the extreme, i.e. listening to day-to-day conversations between &quot;commoners&quot;. This is how I realized that there is often a &quot;correct&quot; way of saying something (as in purely grammatically correct), and the &quot;natural&quot; way (i.e. as expected by native speakers).<p>> <i>&quot;Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules [...] which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken&quot;</i><p>Continuing from my previous point, I think the opposite sometimes applies too. For instance, back in Scotland, I had to force myself to say &quot;If I was&quot; instead of &quot;If I were&quot;, because the mistake has become so systematic that it has almost become a rule.<p>I think grammar is at least as important as vocabulary, particularly in a language like English where the language is so modular that words can fairly easily be made up, to the extent that they are understandable within a logical context, even if incorrect.<p>Finally, I would add culture as a possible fourth big task to add to your list. This may just be me, but there seems to be a dimension of language closely tied to the culture associated with it. There are idioms that make complete sense to me, yet I cannot explain why to my (French) family. This is ostensibly related to linguistic relativity[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity</a>",1414695945

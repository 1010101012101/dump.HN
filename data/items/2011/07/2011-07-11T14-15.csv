2750922,comment,2748353,2748353,1,0,auganov,,,"99% of all that is crap. Period. 
Persistence + dedication + passion and you can learn any language for free to a functionally fluent level in less than 2 years doing 3-4 hours a day.<p>No different than hacking effort-wise.<p>The catch is that some amount of rote learning is a must.
Immersion, real life practice etc is all cool, but it's just not the most efficient way. 
The never dying argument that children learn languages fast because of total immersion is some kind of a joke. They don't learn fast, it takes them a lot of time. The only thing they pick up fast is the accent and what I would call language intuition. But building up huge vocabulary takes them a lot of time.<p>So you if you want to be on the fast track you have to combine rote learning and immersion. 
Rote learning for cramming in TONS of vocabulary, you can do 50-100 a day with flashcards. Immersion for getting the feel.<p>If you're smart enough you can pretty much skip speaking practice, I know, very controversial. But if you feel like you can, then yes you can. I strongly believe it can even make things worse for some people. Because they develop bad habits too early.
And I'm talking real life practice here. 
DO talk to yourself in that given language. Think in it. Even speak it aloud to yourself. But don't find language partners for speaking.<p>If you really feel like you want to do the language exchange thing then you can do it very early on, say the first month of learning. And only do text based. It's a good introduction to very basic written language. 
It quickly gets too easy, so you need to be aware when it stops being a learning tool and starts being 100% fun. 
If you can, just stay away.<p>Rote learning will be the hard work part of the equation, so I say try to do as much rote stuff done as you can and when you feel you're burning out just switch to stuff that's more in the immersion department. Then go back and repeat.
With that method extra time that you put in actually increases the rate at which you learn exponentially. 
If you do 1 hour a day I'd bet that even in 6 years you'll have a long way to go. Do 6 a day and you can get fluent with an accent that is close to native accent in a year. Of course mileage varies.<p>Classes are totally not an option. They are full of COMPLETE slackers, language learners really do not have a good reputation, especially at an early stage (who does?).<p>1 on 1 tutoring is good, but don't let the tutor set the pace. The tutor is not for you to practice speaking/listening with. Of course you'll do that with him, because ideally you'll be only speaking in the target language. But his main role is to prepare your daily fix of material to cram and give you an answer when you need it. (less frequently makes little sense, bi daily at most).<p>I often find that it takes TONS of time to actually come up with what I'm going to cram in. Especially once you go deeper. So you can outsource that to the tutor.
And do communicate that you want to go FAST (if you do :-)).<p>Ok. I guess it's enough, I just love learning languages. Most people think my approach is crazy, but well it works for me and I'm sure it worked in past for many many others.<p>If anybody wants some more crazy tips from me just post here or my email is in the profile.",1310396117

Serve it up to smaller blogs that love the free information.  You're just giving them what they want and building an initial relationship, if they don't actually post your data it's fine, but they'll always be happy you sent it to them.<p>Then just do it again, slicing from a different angle and present it to the blogs again.  Once you have data posted somewhere, it's time to move on to guest posts.  Use the data that was posted to ask a different blog if for your next data slice you can exclusively present the data as a guest post. They'll love this, though you'll need to write the article first before they actually agree.<p>Rinse and repeat the system farther up the blog, local news, online news entity, radio, TV totem pole.",1310396043

2750891,comment,2749948,2750604,3,0,scythe,,,"This is mostly because the visible portion of the Sun is not currently undergoing nuclear fusion. Fusion occurs only in the core, not in the outer layers. Also, you're ignoring feedback, which isn't intuitive to ignore -- the blackbody radiation produced by a kilo of 5000 K plasma is huge, enough to supply a person's daily energy and then some -- it just doesn't get emitted from the Sun, which is why that energy will last for another ten billion years. A layperson would probably (try to) count all of the thermal energy which is emitted by such a plasma whenever it's not totally surrounded by more of the same plasma. In that sense, the layperson would be correct -- a kilo of Sun-matter, <i>after being removed from the Sun</i> -- produces a massive amount of power.<p>The density of the Sun is approximately 2 * 10^-4 kg/m^3 in the photosphere ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun</a> ). We're ignoring the core for now, because that's at more like 15000000 K, so. A kilo thus takes up 5 * 10^3 m^3, which is a sphere with radius ~12 m, having a surface area of ~1.4 * 10^3 m^2. The power radiated by a kilo of plasma from the Sun's photosphere is thus is j' = area * sigma * temperature^4, where sigma = 5.67 * 10^-8 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_radiation#Stefan.E2.80.93Boltzmann_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_radiation#Stefan.E2.8...</a> ), so j' = 1.4 * 10^3 * 5.67 * 10^-8 * (5 * 10^3)^4 = 4.96 * 10^10 watts, or well over a person's daily caloric intake <i>every second</i> (In fact, this is approximately the energy consumption of a small country).",1310395669

In order for this to work people have to manually go to the web-based ""yellow pages"" and then register their intent to buy say, a washing machine, and then that gives you a lottery ticket where if you win, you have to prove that you have purchased a washing machine within N days of registering your intent.<p>So suppose I have already decided to buy a washing machine, and GE, Maytag, and Kenmore have all bought into this scheme.

It would be a much simpler thing to write ""CSS Lint checks for good OOCSS habits, but can't be trusted to verify non-OOCSS, so be wary.""<p>><i>Dont use IDs in selectors</i>
><i>They are the fastest way a browser can select a given element.</i><p>Yes and no. Using an ID to get an element via JS is fast, undeniably so. But the difference in selecting by ID vs. Class in CSS is so minuscule it's hardly worth mentioning. If you're styling an element based on an ID used by JS, congratulations, you've just needlessly coupled JS and CSS.<p>><i>Performance at the cost of everything else. Performance as the altar at which all the other benefits of CSS are sacrificed.</i><p>Be more dramatic. OOCSS's primary benefit is to minimize maintenance and reduce CSS filesize. File transfer is the second biggest culprit of page load times. I hardly see optimizing CSS as a tertiary goal, and speeding up CSS does not sacrifice other things if done properly.<p>><i>Utterly arbitrary. Use as many as you need to get whatever result youre after. Youre the designer, you know whats appropriate, and it has little to no impact on performance.</i><p>The issue here is that people who use font-size too much are likely simply not appreciating the cascade. That can be said for numerous other properties like float, font-family, padding, and margins.<p>That all being said, CSS Lint is extraordinarily opinionated. How could it be anything else? If you're looking for a syntax lint, check out W3C's Unicorn. If you're looking to discover a new philosophy for writing reusable, extendable, and optimized CSS, make sure you understand why exactly CSS Lint is throwing you a warning/error and take steps to improve your styles.",1310394074

- online live tutoring - I got a discount for this online tutoring service, about $15 per hour I paid to have a teacher give me a private lesson with a digital whiteboard plus camera. Great for learning basic concepts, grammar, and also conversational. 
- textbooks made for learning - first complete a book that is made for English speakers. Then get a book that is made for children or for people learning the language with no other language support. Like an ESL book with only English inside. 
- make some friends that speak the language. This is ultimately the most important step. Nothing you learn in books or mp3s will stick unless you practice with real human beings.<p>Good luck!",1310393605

""Clean power that powers the Sun"" - yup, he said that. A senior scientist who knows the numbers. See below in the thread how relevant this is. ""Relies only on seawater as fuel"" - check. ""Offers no chance of a catastrophic accident"" - oh come on, even a coal powerplant offers that.<p>Articles like this <i>are</i> a strawman, and Stewart C. Prager, director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, knows better and should be ashamed of himself. To take up just the matter of catastrophic accidents: it is said correctly that a fission powerplant can never explode like a fission bomb - the atoms of fuel are in the wrong arrangement for that. But any continuous system for producing fusion power is theoretically capable of ""running away"" - it is a self-reinforcing process, after all - and producing an actual nuclear explosion. They will design it to make this spectacularly unlikely? OK, sure they will, but let's not talk about this being danger-free.<p>Or the ""fuel from seawater"" thing. Seawater contains 3.3 ppb of uranium, and it would be commercially feasible to extract it if the prices were higher. It's actually easier to do this than to design fusion reactors. And you can use more advanced fission cycles, especially the thorium ones, to extend the energy you get out of fission fuels.<p>EDIT: let me clarify the actual quote from Dr. Prager that I am complaining about:<p><i>Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes  chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium  that can readily be extracted from seawater.</i><p>This is so incredibly misleading in many ways, without containing an actual false statement.

Having said that,<p>1) Please put the year in the title<p>2) Note the difference between domestic intelligence and domestic criminal work. Intelligence is concerned with patterns of behavior. If you can demonstrate that citizens who read X have a 10 times greater likelihood to do something violent, it may be in the state's interest to keep track of that information. This has nothing to do with state harassment or living in a security state: your local sheriff probably does something very similar and has done so for centuries. Police are expected to gather random pieces of trivia to try to reasonably predict if bad things are happening or are going to occur.

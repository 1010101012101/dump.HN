I had him as my professor three times while I was at NYU, and Dewar is very much in touch with real-world engineering projects. Also, hardware and OS-level knowledge is very important during performance optimization, which very often gets left out in ""real-world"" programming jobs due to lack of time in the project schedule and lack of knowledge on behalf of the very same programmers that came out of a vocational education. This is something to lament about in the industry, and not say ""oh well, since we don't do it and seem to get away with it, let's maintain the status quo"".",1217383159

That's not to say that all of the rich people pay taxes - there's a lot of folks who buy Munis and the like for tax avoidance (supposedly reducing the costs of various govt projects) and then there are the folks who have managed their estates so they'll never be taxed (including Warren ""the inheritance tax should be higher"" Buffet).<p>Yes - it's reasonable to exclude SS.  SS is essentially a bad forced savings account.  However, SS is progressive in that the less you contributed, the better your return.  For folks who pay the max, it's a horrible deal.  Both ""contributions"" and benefits are capped so Perot doesn't get $1M/month.<p>The rich pay a lower fraction of their income in consumption taxes than the poor, but that's because they consume a smaller fraction of their income and they don't consume as much ""sin"".  (Most consumption taxes exempt food, which is a larger fraction of poor people's income, but poor people also spend more of their money on tobacco and alcohol.)",1217380333

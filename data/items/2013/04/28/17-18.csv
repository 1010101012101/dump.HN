""there is a 25% chance of rain tomorrow"" isn't really a 25%. It is a confidence score.<p>Something people can grasp better than DNA: Let's say you have a partial thumb print in an imaginary murder. You could eliminate suspects who don't have that portion of the thumb print, but you couldn't confirm that the person or people who match did it. Only that the thumbprint is a ""Pocked Loop"", ""Whorl"", or ""mixed"" and so anyone with a ""tent Arch"" is not the killer.<p>You can be 100% confident that the print excludes the person with the ""Tent Arch"" and if you knew there were only 4 people in the room when the victim in our imaginary scenario died you could even go so far as that since only 2 of them have a potential match that you have a 50% confidence in the match. But Running the test 800 times will not get you to a number better than that.",1367171967

5622029,comment,5621657,5621657,4,0,typicalrunt,,,"I'm curious about what you mean by 'most amount of people you have had on your site at one time'.  This can mean a few different things...<p>1) For monitoring applications like Chartbeat, IIRC they count a user as concurrent if they are on the site anytime within the past 30 seconds.\n2) I've seen real-time monitoring systems count a concurrent user as any visitor in the last 5 seconds.\n3) Lastly, the only real raw numbers that I've seen are the traffic hits through an F5 load balancer to a set of backend servers, and that is the only number that will give you an unbiased # hits per second in real-time.  Unfortunately, this amounts to requests (HTML) to the server and may not be a 1:1 ratio with users.<p>So in terms of what I've seen, it depends on the type of calls and the application.  For the EA forums (forums.ea.com) which I was in charge of up until March 2013...<p>For #1, forums would regularly reach 15,000 on the launch of a new game.  We would sustain that for ~12 hours [1].  On just an average normal non-event day, it pushes 3000 concurrents.\nFor #2, I've seen something north of 3000 for EA forums.\nFor #3, the F5 would report peaks of 200 requests per second.<p>When I built the Campus Wide Login (<a href=""http://www.cwl.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cwl.ubc.ca</a>) SSO auth system for UBC about 11 years ago (still in use today) we would have almost 50-75% of the full campus using it at once, which is about 30k concurrents (unfortunately I didn't have access to the numbers over the F5 LB).  However, most of these calls were for the HTML which then went through an SOA (XML-RPC, ugh) architecture, so I'm sure the req/s was much higher on the XML-RPC backend.<p>[1] this is a feat in itself because most of the forum data is not cached because the business wanted the data in real-time, so the read databases would receive a lot of traffic when the web servers spiked.<p>Edit: formatting",1367171121

5622025,comment,5612849,5612849,1,0,edwinkite,,,"Geologist here. Earth's thermal evolution is unsolved decades after we figured out the stars. The Sun's temperature adjusts to energy production and loss on a 10^6 yr timescale (scaling as the time for a photon to diffuse from the heart of the Sun to the cold surface): << the Sun's age. The Earth's temperature adjusts to internal energy production and surface losses on a billion year timescale: of order the Earth's age. Planets have long memories and history matters. The Sun is reasonably well-mixed. Surface spectroscopy probes the make-up of the whole star. Earth is less well-stirred. Seismic imaging of the deep earth maps the edges of vast pods of material, radioactivity unknown, composition unknown (but definitely distinct from the near-surface stuff), age unconstrained but plausibly as old as the planet [1]. Structure and composition matter [2]. It's a hard problem.<p>But it matters. When you look up at the night sky far from cities, for every star you see there's a habitable-zone Earth-radius planet that's closer [3]. We didn't know that six months ago. We think (for good, but circumstantial reasons) that complex life requires volcano-tectonic resurfacing - necessarily, a hot interior. Given that habitable-zone Earth-radius planets are not in short supply, the difference between fast and slow cooling for planets like Earth is the difference between a Galaxy where most every star system is habitable and one where almost all the planets are cinders.<p>The core-mantle boundary heat flux Q_CMB estimated in this paper constrains the mantle energy balance<p>d(E_mantle)/dt ~ Q_CMB - Q_surf + H_radioactive<p>Surface heat flux Q_surf is ~46 terawatts. Mantle radioactivity H_radioactive is not well constrained but about 10 terawatts [2]. The implication is that despite the high core heat flux, Earth's mantle is cooling fast - maybe 100 microkelvins per century. Volcanism will therefore shut down in much less time than the remaining main sequence lifetime of the Sun. Absent human intervention, the reddening of the Sun won't kill the biosphere, the Earth will.<p>As the mantle cools, the temperature contrast between the mantle and the core will no longer sustain core convection. Then Earth's magnetic field will power down. Without geo-dynamo shielding against galactic and solar radiation, bad things may happen: the rapid shutdown of Mars' dynamo is one hypothesis for the deterioration of Mars climate ~4 Gyr ago [4]. On the other hand, Earth's magnetic field strength decreased by a factor of 20 during the Laschamp Event ~41000 years ago [5], with no known effects on biology (or human culture).<p>Diamond-anvil experiments are tough; few grad students make it past quals without breaking a diamond or two. The diamond-anvil technique is hitting diminishing returns, so modest advances are (rightly) celebrated. The same is true for deep-earth seismology and mantle geochemistry. A good new method is mapping the antineutrino flux from Earth. Antineutrinos are produced by radioactive decay and move in a straight line from source to surface. Mapping the Earth with geoneutrino observatories in the deep sea would help determine the power source for plate tectonics [6].<p>----<p>[1] Garnero & McNamara: <a href=""http://mcnamara.asu.edu/Publications/pdfs/Garnero_and_McNamara_Science_2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcnamara.asu.edu/Publications/pdfs/Garnero_and_McNama...</a><p>[2] Korenaga, ""Urey Ratio and The Structure and Evolution of Earth's Mantle"", <a href=""http://people.earth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/korenaga08d.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.earth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/korenaga08d...</a>\nKorenaga is the best mid-career theorist actively working on this problem.<p>[3] New result, from several teams working independently to analyze the Kepler dataset:\nCaltech <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3013</a> (read this one first); Harvard team #1 <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1647"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1647</a>; Harvard team #2 <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0842</a>; Berkeley <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0460"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0460</a>.

I haven't heard a 100% convincing answer, but I'm most of the way there.<p>Here are the key differences:<p>1. More MDs, fewer MBAs. HMOs were generally run by insurers (payers) far removed from patients. ACOs are being created primarily by hospital systems and physician groups, sometimes in partnership with a payer (which has more experience managing risk).<p>2. More/Big data. We have a lot more data, and we've gotten a lot smarter about how to analyze it. So instead of simply rationing care, we can identify and then focus on areas to improve quality and cut costs. Also, the (unsteady) march towards electronic health records (EHRs) should improve this even more.<p>3. Quality measures. We can leverage data to force providers to compete on quality. See <a href=""http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/</a> for a simple example.<p>4. Freedom to change plans.

For bursty loads it feels great.<p>But the moment writes are sustained for longer than it can merge segments (say while doing a bulk load), per-write latency spikes appear (average op time jumps from <1ms to >30000ms for a single record), and eventually it'll get so far behind that all attempts to progress will hang entirely, waiting for the background compactor to free up room in the youngest generation. The effect seems to worsen exponentially with database size. To attempt to mitigate this, when LevelDB notices it's falling behind it begins sleeping for 0.1s every write.<p>It's especially easy to trigger on slow CPUs with spinning rust drives.<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/leveldb/ylEXQAs6XVA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/leveldb/...</a>",1367169854

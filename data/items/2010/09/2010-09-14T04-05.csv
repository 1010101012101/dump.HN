If you're bad at planning, then you'll have problems no matter how little you have to do.  And if you make a point of surrounding yourself with people who are able to manage to be on time, then you'll all get more done.<p><i>I value your time, but I value mine more.</i><p>As my brother drilled into me a long time ago, ""Yes, but..."" is just a dishonest way to say ""No"".  Your actions clearly say that you DON'T value other people's time.  There is no need to bother pretending otherwise.<p><i>And obviously you're not as in demand as other people are.</i><p>No.  It is called ""planning"".  And not being rude and selfish.  You might learn this ""planning"" thing.  It could let you get more done without putting as much effort out.<p><i>Sorry you can't appreciate that.</i><p>Apparently you are aware that it is inconvenient when other people prove to have desires that are at odds with your selfishness.  But you clearly don't let that bother you too much.<p>My attitude is that people like you are productivity obstacles to route around and avoid.<p>(For the record I am someone whose natural tendency is to be chronically late.  But <i>not</i> when someone else is depending on me.)",1284440366

For instance, if one guy is turned I can shoot him last and instead shoot the closest then the second determine the best place to duck to reload if needed.  All the while, I process sound from everywhere else, keep a running map in my head (I'm very good with spatial orientation) and can check off where explosions have taken place or possible spawn points coming up.<p>I can also tell the difference between a player with an 80ms ping and a 30ms ping.<p>This all comes with a caveat.  I have been playing for ~8 years off and on so I have experience and confidence in my abilities.  Also, to achieve such a state to determine split second actions, my heart rate is well above a sedentary resting state.  Once I figured this out, I stopped playing as much as I can only assume that the adrenaline rushes from gaming while sitting can only be bad for my health.<p>Two cents..",1284440214

Also, I wanted to get rid of those tabs that had been on the far left side of Firefox for ages. I'm not even sure why I posted it to HN; I just did it and then intended to head out the door afterward, except that all of a sudden my web server became unresponsive.<p>Anyway: the ability to get results from the past year is <i>great</i>, and I was totally unaware of it. I'll update my post shortly with a note about that. Having something like that sticking right out on the left-hand side would be even better. :-)<p>I think I often see people complaining about search quality (here, and in the other HN thread I linked to from about a year back, as examples), but if you ask them about the specifics of the search, they don't remember. I think that's a problem that needs to be solved somehow. Although it's at least partly laziness on the user's part, I think Google could view this as a huge amount of potentially beneficial information that they're missing out on. Trying to improve search results without knowing what problems people are having with them is challenging, at least.<p>It would be nifty if there were some kind of ""these were not the search results I was looking for"" quick form linked from certain types of search results.",1284438919

If you really want to get people to cut it out, make real world consequences. Say ""the meeting starts at 9:05 sharp, the doors will be shut and no one will be admitted after that."" Think really hard if the situation calls for it, but it does work if you do stuff like that. If you're a professor, you could say to anyone coming in late - ""get out. see you next week."" You won't have people showing up late if you announce you're going to do that and follow through.

Out of all men with two children, the probability that they will have two daughters is 1/4, the probability that they will have two sons is 1/4. This leaves heterogeneous offspring occurring 1/2 the time.<p>If the man is able to make the statement ""I have two kids, at least one's a boy"", this puts him among the 3/4 of all men with one or two sons. The probability of a man with two sons cannot jump from 1/4 to 3/8 (half of 3/4), as you assert earlier.<p>It's unintuitive, but it's more obvious when you negate the statement: ""I have two children, but I do not have two daughters.""",1284437379

1689397,comment,1688588,1688588,0,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"I left a few comments below, but I wanted to say thanks for mentioning some searches that Google didn't do well on. They're interesting searches, so I thought I'd break them down:<p>- [avaya 103r manual] It's a fair complaint to say some low-quality results are returned, but there's a reason. Do that search and Google says ""About 1,510 results."" That's a minuscule number of results--it usually means the web has very little content that matches that query in any way. That's why the lower-quality and foreign results show up: we're scraping the bottom of the barrel of the web to find any results at all, and there's not many pages that have that those words. If you go to avaya.com and search for [103r], they don't find any results either. It's hard for Google to return useful Avaya results when avaya.com doesn't have that word anywhere on the site. :)<p>- You were looking for specs on a Gateway mt6840 motherboard, specifically the socket. Instead of trying to solve that in one query, I'd go for doing it in two steps. I did the query [site:gateway.com mt6840] to see if there was any authoritative result, and the #1 result was <a href=""http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/2007/Oasis/1014554R/1014554Rsp2.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/2007/Oasis/1014554R/1014...</a> which has specs for that motherboard, but not the socket. But that spec sheet mentions that the motherboard uses a Intel® Core™ 2 Duo processor T2450. So then I searched for [T2450 socket] and got a Wikipedia page that says the T2450 uses Socket M. Just to be safe, searching for [MT6840 ""socket m""], which returns a page on computing.net that's a forum with some ads, but the page mentions ""945GM-based laptops support Socket M Core 2 Duo CPUs."" The Gateway spec sheet says the MT6840 uses a 945GM chipset, so Socket M seems like a safe bet.<p>- The last search was about an OpenSolaris machine that wouldn't boot and that said ""Error 16"" instead. The complaint was that the results were stale/old. I did the search [opensolaris boot ""error 16""]. Then over on the left-hand side, click ""Show search tools"" and click ""Past year"" to get results from the past year. The #1 result shows a long discussion about debugging this (which implies it's not a trivial issue). The #2 result is a discussion that points into opensolaris.org, which then points to this bug: <a href=""http://bugs.opensolaris.org/view_bug.do?bug_id=6774616"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.opensolaris.org/view_bug.do?bug_id=6774616</a> . My point on this query is that you can use the left-hand search bar to restrict the results to a certain time range (e.g. only results from the last week, month, or year).<p>We do try to provide tools (e.g. estimated number of results, or the ability to restrict results by date) to help find the answers--or to find out if there aren't good answers on the web.<p>And in some cases like your #2 search, we could do a better job of synthesizing information. If page A says that a motherboard uses this chip/chipset and page B says that this chip/chipset uses this socket, then we could infer what socket the motherboard uses. Inferring information like this is really tricky though because the web can be really noisy.<p>I'm not saying Google shouldn't do better on these searches. You're clearly a power searcher, and I share your frustration when it's really hard to find what you want using Google. I'll pass this article around within the search quality group at Google and see if we could do better on searches like these--thanks for the feedback.",1284437204

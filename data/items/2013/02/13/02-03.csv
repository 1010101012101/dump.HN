For example, trying to figure out how to make a versioned release.  The download link they provide gets you the latest version from the repository.  Took me a bit of searching and looking at other projects to realize that if you tag a release, it can make that available too.<p>But now trying to get that to show up in the project page (using their auto page generator) -- I ended up having to hand edit the html code, because I wanted the web page to have a list of specific releases.  But even their source download link isn't fully intuitive.  For example, mine shows up as ""<a href=""https://github.com/derekp7/snebu/archive/1.0.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/derekp7/snebu/archive/1.0.tar.gz</a>, but it downloads a file called ""snebu-1.0.tar.gz"".<p>Oh, and to get the readme file to utilize their markdown, you have to call it reamde.md, instead of readme.txt.  And I'm looking for where my users can leave feedback or discuss things, other then opening an issue in the issue tracker.  But they don't have any mailing lists or forums (I guess most projects set up a separate forum, and link to it from the readme.md file or the gh-pages page).<p>What I'd like to see is a document going over the entire lifecycle of all the features offered through github, including documenting the standard practices for items that they don't provide (such as the forums thing).

Can't comment on the amount of work available in Python compared to Ruby, just don't know the Ruby market, but for Python/Django there's quite enough freelance work via elance/odesk. Not sure if you'd get to $2-3k per month right away, but that's sure doable once you get some experience.<p>On the other hand, you have the advantage of being able to look for clients locally, and I only worked remotely - living in Russia now. Seems local rates in Australia (and other first world countries) are higher than in online market.<p>Seconding the importance of Javascript. I picked it up months after I started with Python, but starting with it earlier would've been a good idea for sure.<p>Again, most freelance work involves at least some frontend part, and if you're familiar with HTML/CSS/JS, even without Python, there's always something to do.

5210998,comment,5210008,5210008,83,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I see a couple comments here, including the highest voted top level comment, questioning how the xbox can be ""crushing"" their competition given that a straightforward reading of console sales indicates things aren't so cut and dried.<p>However, the xbox is crushing its competition, in several ways, and let me explain why a naive reading of unit sales is misleading.<p>Many consoles sell at a loss, especially initially, or on a very small margin, console sales alone are meaningless. Console sales themselves just serve to expand the player base, enabling follow on game and service sales where the vast majority of the profit to the console maker and of course to the game makers comes from.<p>Here's where things get interesting. Nintendo has always sold everything at a profit, so they've never lost money on incremental console sales. However, again that margin is still fairly small, what they need is game sales. And for the Wii that's been a disaster. They sold a huge amount of consoles but a lot of the people who own them don't play them very much, and they don't buy many games. This is a big reason why Nintendo has stopped making a profit overall as a company the last few quarters, which has been rather disastrous for them.<p>Now let's look at Sony. They started off with a crazy console design, which is almost an experimental prototype device, this is not the sort of thing one usually does with a console. The result was that the hardware of the console was hugely expensive, which meant that they were losing a huge amount of money on every console sale, about the same as the cost of a Wii. This meant that Sony needed to have strong follow-on game sales to make up for such huge loses. However, because the console was so difficult to develop for they struggled with game availability for a long time. Eventually these factors started to become less of a problem. Multi-platform game engines eventually matured sufficiently to where it wasn't a huge problem to target PS3/360/PC releases for most games, and that has helped PS3's game library tremendously, in addition to a very small handful of excellent exclusive titles (such as Little Big Planet, Heavy Rain, etc.) Also, eventually Sony managed to reduce the hardware cost of the PS3 down to a point where they weren't bleeding money on each sale so horrifically. However, despite all of this improvement it's questionable whether the PS3 has made a total profit for Sony overall, and if it has it's likely not very large. Worse yet, a lot of Sony's big efforts such as the playstation network and the Sony Move have not taken off and not garnered much enthusiasm in the market.<p>And then we get to the 360. This console certainly has its fair share of problems and debacles. At launch it was definitely sold at a loss to the company. It struggled with reliability problems and expensive warranty extensions through many of the early hardware iterations. And sales in Japan have always been weak. But, somehow it managed to come out ahead. The 360 never sold at as much of a loss as the PS3 and it didn't take long for them to get to a point where they reduced hardware costs enough to make a profit on console sales. Even with the expensive $1 billion warranty extension their balance sheet on pure hardware alone is far, far better than Sony's, which means that MS actually needs to sell fewer games per console to come out ahead in total profit. As it turns out, people who own 360s are far more active gamers than people who own other consoles. They play for more hours per month, and they spend more money on games. Of all of the consoles currently on store shelves, the 360 has the highest multiple of average number of follow-on game purchases per console. But it doesn't stop there. The Kinect add-on has been one of the most popular consumer electronics devices in history. Also, whereas every major competing online multiplayer service is offered for free (Steam, Origin, PSN), Microsoft's Xbox Live Gold service costs money. On its own it has subscription volume and costs similar to the most successful MMOs in existence (such as WoW). That's a testament to the sheer volume of people who think that Microsoft's service offering is valuable enough to pay cold hard cash for, but it also, of course, goes straight to Microsoft's bottom line, to the tune of around a billion dollars per year. And because it's a digital service the development costs are fairly low. But wait, there's more. In addition to game sales, xbox players are also more likely to purchase DLC packs and other digital content such as xbox live arcade games. Again the incremental costs on these digital goods are fairly low so Microsoft (and the game publishers) make a much higher margin on them.<p>What does this all mean? Several things. First, in total Microsoft has been far better at consistently extracting significant profits from the gaming market over the lifetime of the current console generation. Second, Microsoft has far more momentum in terms of game sales and customer loyalty and enthusiasm than the other console players. Third, Microsoft is making far more headway than other console makers in earning revenue from digital goods and services, where the profit margins are the highest. Fourth, many game makers find that they make a lot more money from the xbox versions of their products, which helps ensure that exclusive games that aren't on the xbox are a rarity.<p>And this is precisely why this year we will see all 3 companies release new consoles, and why Nintendo has already done so. Because without a significant disruption in the status quo the result is that the xbox will continue to outpace everyone else, and continue to gobble up more and more market share and gaming revenue. Nintendo is trying to give themselves a chance to stay relevant. And Sony is trying to put themselves on a new footing. And Microsoft is trying to hold onto what they have or extend their lead.<p>Note that I intentionally left out a lot of complicating elements such as competition from PC and mobile/tablet gaming, introduction of new console makers, etc. That may play a role in the future but it hasn't played a significant role in the fight between the different home consoles so far.",1360722898

If that supply chain was opened to anyone else it would be like getting the power of an xBox 360 at $99, forget the raspberry pi.<p>Now I am not too keen on the video games industry and an insider might have differ, but I've tried to do my fact checking. In a way the device you described for Apple's target specs is what Nintendo did the Wii - and were hugely successful for. They sold 100s of millions of units, and it wasn't sold at a loss so they minted money. However, despite their huge shipments, only Nintendo enjoyed success. The people who bought the Wii, only bought 1 or 2 games (like WiiFit and WiiSports) and it became incredibly hard for third parties to market big budget games to them. Effectively the 3rd party abandoned Nintendo.<p>Secondly, if the system is not powerful enough, I believe gamers will reject your platform. I believe this is more important than the ""No wireless"" issue because gamers are the only ones who will spend $59.99 on a big budget game, and as a result 3rd party companies will suffer. You can't sell Call of Duty at 99 cents, and gamers don't want to play a Call of Duty that looks like it was made in 2002.<p>So the market, I believe splits into 2 groups - \n1.) Average folk, who want the box.\n2.) ""Gamers"", who want the software.<p>We can already see this today. There are Netflix Machines like the Roku (1.) and consoles (PS3). However I believe that the the console guys (Nintendo/Sony) will eventually win out, because they provided the hardware (the hard part) first. Its relatively simple to get the indie devs on your side - open up the platform. But to get the big budget guys on your side you have to convince them that they won't waste 50 million producing the next CoD because it will be drowned out by the likes of Angry Birds and Temple Run.<p>Lastly, I am not sold on the fact that Apple will be able to push the same numbers as Sony on Apple TV without ""big boy"" support. If EA is not going to support your system I don't think the Apple Box will sell as much. (the Apple TV only sold 2.7 mill while PS3 sold 10 times as much). While Apple is known as the company that can sell a brick to the masses, I am not sure they can sell 25 million consoles without some big franchise names at launch.",1360722470

For example, the individual ""Unlimited Nationwide 4G"" plan (also including unlimited talk and text) is $89.99/month for a Classic plan and $69.99/month for a Value plan.

Do you think T-Mobile lets people save $20/month by saying the magic word ""value""?<p>Second, even putting aside T-Mobile for a moment, there are plenty of other cost-of-ownership differences between a contract iPhone and a non-contract iPhone. For instance, absent additional coverage (e.g. extended warranty or equipment insurance), suppose you break it. How much will it cost to replace? If you haven't signed a contract, you have the option of signing one to subsidize the cost of a replacement, but if you have a contract, then what? Or suppose you take a trip overseas.

There are years you spend obsessed with it. Then there are years when it's a normal part of your life-- enjoyable, but not worth moral compromises or stupid risks-- and the obsession seems silly and you're embarrassed to have had such a fixation.<p>I also tend to believe that using any experience as a trophy cheapens it. When you remember something, you actually retrieve the memory and store an updated copy, which means the state in which you recall it will influence the long-term memory. If you turn an experience into a social token, you're recalling it with a cheap mind, and the memory will turn cheap over time.<p>I talked to an experienced meditator about this, and he said he never discusses experiences (except with his guru, when he was younger) because people are either less advanced and will not understand them, or more advanced and have no use for them.<p>Experience isn't the only point, which is my problem with psychedelic drug culture. There are people who use psychedelics for genuinely spiritual purposes, but they seem to be a minority in that world. The culture as a whole seems to be heavy on experience and light on insight and self-development.

I'm not saying that I'm a paragon of virtuefar too often, I don't speak up when I see or hear things that bother me and that I know are hurtful. YetScalzi's essay is <i>hard</i> to disagree with, at least in the American context, because it is true at pretty much every level. It doesn't tell you that you can't complain about things, but it certainly says that whatever hurt you haveit could be much much worse than it is.<p>I was <i>absolutely</i> dismissing your hyperbolic list <i>because</i> of its hyperbole, and I was doing so in part because Scalzi addressed the baseline (which is what's really at discussion here) and the oft-hyperbolic attempts (like yours) to pretend that because ""Men Have Problems, Too"" that the discussion of the baseline isn't even worthy of being talked about.<p>But if you really want to have that list dissected, here we go:<p>1. ""You can be called dumb your entire childhood"". Suggesting that only boys hear this sort of thing is laughable. In my experience, boys are more likely to be called smart and clever than girls, who are more likely to be considered adorable and pretty. <i>Systemically</i>, girls in America are told that they aren't <i>supposed</i> to be good at math or engineering from about grade four on (boys don't do better in math until about the seventh grade).<p>There are cultures that consider the education of girls to be a waste of time, money, and effortand I'm not just referring to the hard-line Taliban. These girls aren't just told that they're dumb, they're told that they're not even worth being told that they're dumb.<p>2. ""it is made clear to you that you are inherently a monster capable of anything, that you have most likely raped someone"". This is, of course, pure hyperbole when it's said by those who say it against men, and equally so when a man repeats it as if it were an accepted truth about all men.<p>Even so, there are far too many men who simply do not understand that not only does ""no"" mean ""no"", but <i>only</i> ""yes"" means ""yes"" (sex while she's blindingly drunk is not consensual, sorry).\n3. ""it is funny if your genitals are mutilated because you probably deserved it"". I remember a lot of jokes around the Bobbitt case, but I also remember jokes not too longer after the Challenger accident. That case is <i>very</i> difficult because Bobbitt <i>was</i> an abuser (and continued to be with future spouses) and <i>may</i> have raped (he was charged and acquitted) his wife (marriage does not mean automatic consent). She was considered not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to an institution for a short period of time.<p>On the other hand, almost all of the campaigners that I know or have encountered against male circumcision are women.<p>4. ""if a woman hits you, you probably deserved it and you should take it like a man"". I don't even know what to say to this one, because I've never heard anything like it and don't know any woman who would say it. There's a few men I could imagine saying it, but they're ""macho men"" in any case. Women <i>are</i> charged with assault.<p>5. ""your life can be ruined by simple accusation by a woman and if she was lying there is no punishment for her"". With the first part of your statement, you highlight a legitimate (if <i>rare</i>) problem; with the second part of your statement, you go off the rails. Look at the DSK case: his accuser is facing a civil suit over the loss of face here. If someone lies about a case and is caught doing it and the embarrassment for the prosecutor is high enough, you're going to be facing some music.<p>6. ""if you divorce, your children will automatically go to your wife unless she is a criminal"". In most jurisdictions, this is no longer true. Family courts want amicable separations and arrangements where possible (they're substantially cheaper and more stable on the family) but will look at the stability offered by both parents when determining the primary caregiver and the visitation schedule. The cases that I have heard where this tends to be true have judges who make such judgements on fallacious ""traditional"" (e.g., ""a mother's place is in the home"" traditional) arguments. This is the same sort of fallacy that spurs on ""covenant"" marriage law efforts.<p>7. ""even if she initiated the divorce, you will still have to support her"". Once again, I'm not even sure where to go with this one, mostly because it's full of wounded male ignorance.<p>(1) Where this sexism is entrenched in law (and it depends on the jurisdiction; in Ontario, the law is income-balanced with equal division of property), this is based on the perception of the woman as the stay-at-home mother and homemaker. Income-balanced laws <i>still</i> tend to favour the woman because (2) women generally make less money than men; when my wife divorced her first husband, she could have been liable for a equalization payment to her then-husband because she made more than he did.<p>Let's be clear, though, that the ignorance in this statement is actively dangerous. It does not matter who <i>initiated</i> the divorce (that's sort of the point behind 'no-fault' divorces). Under your scheme, somene who is leaving an abusive partner would not be eligible for any part of what they gave up. This is a great way to ensure that these people never leave their abusersand as such are more likely to be seriously injured or killed.<p>8. ""political figures proclaim that women are the true victims of war even though you were the one who lost his legs in battle"". I hear this more about kids than about women. I also hear this mostly from people who are, essentially, chickenhawks.<p>9. ""if you want to stay at home and look after your kids, you are lazy, if you want to focus on your career you are an uncaring father (either is okay for a woman)"". I'll have to tell the couple of guys that I know who are stay-at-home dads that they're considered lazy. AndI guess you've never heard of women being called ""ambitious bitches"". Look <i>carefully</i> at what you said here, and then go back and read what has been written about Marissa Mayer and her recent pregnancy. Not only was her suitability as a businessperson called into question <i>because</i> she was pregnant, her suitability as a <i>mom</i> was called into question because she didn't take a long maternity leave. Resolve that conundrum without determining that it's double-standards sexismand maybe I'll give you this one.<p>10. ""you are portrayed as bumbling idiot on television"". That Chrissy Snow on Three's Company was <i>so</i> smart, what about Kelly Bundy! Not all characterizations of men on TV are Peter Griffin or Homer Simpson or Al Bundy. Going back to somewhat before the same period as Three's Company, you have Mike Stivic (""Meathead"" played by Rob Reiner). You've got Alex P Keaton (not bumbling, not an idiot, but not like the rest of his family, either).<p>11. ""you are told that you are lucky if a woman gives you the time of day"" and ""if you approach a woman you can be called a creep, if you don't you are shy"". If you <i>act</i> like a creep, you probably <i>are</i> a creep. There is a time, place, and way to approach someone with respectand acting outside of that realm is creepy. Look at the discussions that female cosplayers have had recently about the (negative) attention that they've gotten by creeps who think that it's okay to take rear shots without permission (and one thing I read recently was interesting, because she was <i>more</i> than happy to give permission for people to photograph hershe made her costume to be <i>seen</i>, after allbut the shots without permission and that completely sexualized her turned her off).<p>12. ""if your wife hires a hitman to kill you, she will be acquitted because you apparently abused her despite no evidence of this"". Huh. If you're talking about the Nicole Doucet case, it seems to be an unusual case, but it probably says much more about the RCMP's handling of the case than it does about her ex-husband. He <i>is</i> an unfortunate injured party in this case, but there are plenty of <i>real</i> convictions of women who have hired hitmen (successful or no) to kill their partners. Your knowledge of this case is probably as deep as my knowledge: not very deep at all, and it's a lightning rod case much like the old McDonald's coffee case. By the by, your characterization is typically wrong on one point: she was <i>not</i> acquitted. Her conviction was set aside, and the grounds were based on misconduct. (The laws are also different here in Canada; prosecutors can appeal acquittals.)<p>13. ""you are treated like a creep if you show any interest in being around children"" Once again, I'll have to tell all of the male teachers that I know that they are creeps! It's going to be shocking news to them.<p>I don't know you, but you've somehow picked up a lot of beliefs that are contrafactual or are at best truthy. I treated your list with derision because, frankly, that's all that a hyperbolic list like that actually <i>deserves</i>.",1360721279

If that karma is negative, that might take the form of an immediate psychotic crisis instead of some longer-to-unfold variety that might, due to time, be more manageable.<p>My personal belief is that, moreso than any religious belief, it's important to manage the karma we experience-- to learn from the bad, and not to turn the good into bad by becoming hubristic. Negative karma <i>will</i> ripen, and the important thing to do is to let it do so in a way that doesn't turn into recursive negativity that generates more bad karma (either for oneself, or in negative actions toward others). What bothers me about these drugs is that they seem to take away some of that ability to manage the karma that comes through. You experience a lot of sudden karmic ripening, which is interesting, but the insight that needs to develop over time isn't there for a lot of people, and those I've met who I think <i>could</i> use those drugs effectively (rather than haphazardly) often have no interest.

I'd rather talk to a zen master any day of the week.<p>Personally, I'm not interested in using these drugs at this point in my life, but I don't think they should be illegal or as stigmatized (in the larger society) as they are. They're probably less dangerous than alcohol. The problem is that, if you choose to use these drugs, you're trying out a technology that's still in the very early experimental stages, mostly because the research has been (wrongly, I would argue) outlawed.",1360721050

I've seen a lot of cities I'd describe as ""robust"", and only <i>one</i> of them, Venice, wasn't swarming with cars. Although they may be at odds, it's clear from just looking at nearly any modern city that cars and robust cities are <i>not</i> incompatible.<p>The article tacitly admits this, with the lowest rate of automobile commuting in their data set still over 40%. Which makes the terribly overstated title even more puzzling.",1360720811

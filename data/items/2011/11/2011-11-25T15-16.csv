3277340,comment,3277219,3277219,8,0,pace,,,"Can it be true that the Python coverage on HN is overproportional compared to its real world usage?<p>If I look around the world is full of Ruby and Rails. Sites, libs, meetups, developers, everything is on Ruby or Ruby on Rails. Python and Django devs are so damn rare in real world -- I just know two of 100.<p>Not that I don't like Python but I am really wondering why Python gets such a strong coverage on HN. Every second day there's some Python thing on HN. BTW with Clojure it's the same but Clojure is something new, so I understand the visibility there.<p>Please don't downvote -- it's nothing against Python, I just want to see if the Python base increased or something happend I've missed. Thanks<p>How can it be?<p>EDIT: Thanks to all for the replies. What's interesting about this thread: I got tons of downvotes (besides upvotes) for the first comment. So, I assume this Python vs Ruby discussion seems to be a very emotional topic. Thanks to the replies I have now a better understanding that Python is older and dominant in a many non-web environments. My impression is still that especially in web environments we have much more pace and development in Rails than Django (just compare what DHH put in 3.1, Coffee, Sass, etc.  -- no flame war just a questions dear downvoters, don't freak out again)--Rails feels just more vibrant regarding web dev. But Rails is not Ruby ;-) It's just that I see all the Python stuff on HN -- which is slightly focussed on online/web/Internet -- and I really considered learning Python for web dev until I checked <a href=""http://www.google.de/trends?q=python+django%2C+ruby+rails&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.de/trends?q=python+django%2C+ruby+rails&#3...</a><p>EDIT2: but there's a new rising star:

Manual search of paper documentation sucks.<p>Before Al Gore invented the interwebs, I kept lots of notes in notebooks.  I almost never shared the notes and almost never referred to them after the development phase of the project ended.<p>I now use a wiki and ""issues"" in  a tracking system (e.g. Redmine) to keep my ""engineering notebooks"".  This has proven invaluable time and again.<p>2) The importance of decisions is mostly discovered in retrospect. :-(  I find many holes in my notes when I do something a second time, even when I <i>think</i> I'm keeping good notes the first time.  The good news is that my notes are pretty good after the second pass.<p>3) I don't know if it is laziness, inconvenience, or otherwise, but my experience is similar to the OP in that I tend to take fewer notes that I should and I have a hard time getting my coworkers to take half as many notes as I take. :-(  Again, I find an electronic notebook open in a web browser on the desktop you are doing the work on is much more effective than paper and pen.<p>Cut'n'paste >> pen >> sword.",1322235995

3277192,comment,3277125,3277125,25,0,eftpotrm,,,"Which brings to mind....<p><i>Five monkeys are caged together and there are some bananas hanging from the top of the cage. Some scientists attach an automated device for sensing if the bananas are moved; once a monkey tries to get any, an electric shock travels through the cage so that all monkeys get shocked. In the beginning, a single monkey climbs up to the bananas, touches them and every monkey gets shocked. So he doesnt try anymore, but the other four monkeys try the same thing and the result comes to be the same. Therefore, the monkeys learn something in common: that is, do not get the bananas! Youll get a painful electric shock! The scientists then replace one of the original monkeys with a new one. This new monkey sees the bananas and wants to get them right away, but the other four monkeys beat it when they see its actions. Since these original four monkeys think the new monkey will make them get shocked, they stop the new monkey from getting the bananas. This monkey tries a few times and the others beat it every time without it ever getting the bananas. Of course, all five monkeys dont get shocked. The scientists then replace another of the original monkeys with a new one. This second new monkey sees the bananas and you bet it wants to get them immediately. But, sadly, the others beat it and the first new monkey beats the newest one even harder then the others (for the newest one is the rookie and has the lowest social status). Just like before, the newest monkey tries several times to get the bananas and is stopped by the others when they attack him. The scientists continue to replace all the original monkeys until no monkeys who actually felt the electric shock remain. Now none of the five new monkeys dare to touch the bananas yet none of them know why. They only know whomever wants to get the bananas will be beaten.</i><p>An interesting thought; has anyone else tried to implement it fully rather than piecemeal? Certainly it sounds a good idea and one to try on my next project.",1322233537

3277186,comment,3275698,3276305,2,0,loso,,,"It's more of what works in the game but doesn't work in real life. In Madden an old glitch that has since been fixed is that whenever the Quarterback would break the pocket, the receivers would break their route. And when they broke their route the receivers would go to the same spot every single time (towards the sideline). But at the same time, the DB's would get confuse which would then leave the receiver wide open. This would happen EVERY SINGLE TIME. So you would have wide open receivers no matter if the defense was in zone or in man.<p>Every football player knows that the db's would be looking for  this in real life and would step up and stop the play after one or two times of this happening. But in the old versions of Madden the corner back would not learn and you had an open man every time. The only way to stop this was to have a team with a good blitzing line backer or defensive end and hope he gets to the QB in time. (This glitch made McNabb almost unstoppable in several versions of Madden.)<p>Another problem in the old Maddens was that if you had the tight end lined up on the left and had him go up five yards and then had him cut left quickly then if the defense was in man he would get the ball every time. And when the defense was in zone he would probably get the ball 70% of the time. In real life a highly skilled LB would be able to stop a sub par TE on this play. Just by being faster. But in the world of Madden the worst TE would get a completion against anyone.<p>These and the other tricks I would use were effective in Madden versions 97-03. The AI is much better now but there are still glitches. I just don't play it enough anymore to have figured them out. Others have though.",1322233405

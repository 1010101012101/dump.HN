3564078,comment,3562137,3563573,1,0,impendia,,,"I am a math professor at a large state university in the US. A comment and a question:<p>> Mathematicians teach math to do more math, which in turn is used to to even more math.<p>That is true of some mathematicians, and of some subjects. But I think most mathematicians teach and learn math because they think it's cool, not because it's useful -- either to learn more math, or for the ""real world"".<p>I might also add that I always appreciate it when teachers take a very long view of things. For example I have trained in the martial arts, and most teachers take the perspective that you want to master the art completely, rather than just learn one or two things. Some people don't like this, but I deeply appreciate it.<p>> The problem, as I still see it, is that nobody fucking tells you why. They throw it at you and expect you to deal with it. No further explanation - ""It's math, we ain't gotta explain shit.""<p>As a math instructor I am always looking for ways to improve, but I'm having trouble extracting useful criticism from your remarks. ""They throw it at you and expect you to deal with it"" seems to be true of challenging lessons in anything.<p>I would cheerfully welcome general advice and suggestions from you or any other HN readers.

Here GPL is pretty much the de facto standard open source licence.<p>I'm not sure what you mean by 'web software', web applications? If you are talking of frameworks/programming languages then those categories are indeed generally open sourced through MIT/BSD-style licencing or LGPL (where only changes directly made to the LGPL licenced code needs to be open sourced.<p>>'I think modern authors are more interested in others using their software unencumbered than they are concerned about some ideological battle or keeping software 'open'.'<p>I think 'modern authors' are being made aware of how companies are increasingly using or even basing their entire existance on open source but not contributing back at anything nearly the same extent. Worse, enhancements are being kept in-house thus requiring duplication of effort in order to gain those enhancements.<p>I think keeping open source 'open' is absolutely key. In some areas it is less necessary to enforce this through licences, traditionally these have been programming languages, frameworks, single purpose libraries - generally code which serves as building blocks. It also depends on how much you are reliant on/hoping for external help.<p>When Google releases a video codec or a programming language as open source then they aren't really looking for any contributions, they have enough man-power to develop it all themselves in the direction they so choose. They also have the man-power to match any features of proprietary forks.<p>If on the other hand you are releasing something which you believe is promising but you need help with it, or you release something finished which can be better, then GPL/LGPL makes perfect sense as you will as an 'end user' be subject to any enhancements done to your code in the form of source code.<p>Also, while companies undoubtably love 'using' BSD/MIT licenced code, when it comes to 'contributing' GPL seems favoured. Linux, GCC comes directly to mind as projects where companies pay developers to write GPL licenced code. Also companies who later choose to open source their proprietary projects generally seems to favour GPL, for example practically all commercial games which have been open sourced are licenced as GPL.<p>This brings me to my last point, which is that GPL is great for cooperative development. This is perhaps particularly attractive for large players competing in a field where they want to cooperate on something, obvious example is again the Linux kernel where companies like Red Hat, IBM, Oracle etc compete for the same market but cooperately develop the base product (Linux). I can't see something like this ever working using a BSD/MIT style licence as then they wouldn't be legally bound to share enhancements.",1328655218

3564031,comment,3562776,3562776,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Bad code is a time sink.<p>Think about it. Good code doesn't have many bugs, it's easy to maintain, extend, and improve, and it's easy to review manually to look for defects. Thus, modifying good code or interfacing with good code takes very little time and very few attempts to get right.<p>So where does our time get spent? Working with and using bad code of course. Bad code is hard to modify and extend, but almost all code needs modification in its life. Modifying bad code takes a lot of time and effort because it's crufty and broken so it tends to at best maintain or lower the overall code quality while adding features. Bad code spawns bad code. Poor APIs lead to clumsy workarounds and hacks in client code, which trickles down as technical debt elsewhere. Bad code tends to be awkward and difficult to follow so in order to ensure quality it needs to be tested thoroughly, which takes a lot of effort.<p>Technical debt has interest, and it's typically a pretty high rate. Pretty soon you find your development velocity is slowed because all your time is absorbed by dealing with bad code.<p>My advice: identify bad code and be ruthless about setting aside dedicated time to eradicate it. Have a policy or culture of constant refactoring when anyone makes a code change. Keep track of your major pain points and strive to solve them. Sometimes that's not possible if you are in a giant company but sometimes you can get a lot more done than you'd imagine. The best teams are the ones who spend their time writing more good code to go with existing good code, they tend to be exponentially more productive than teams who get bogged down in firefighting as a way of life.",1328655045

I see myself as a reasonable coder so I should be able to solve most problems, and the problems I can't solve at least my investigation can provide a top-notch bug report for other maintainers can skip some of the tedious investigation.<p>I don't find that this is just an OSS motive to me though as even in closed-source I'll often find myself in disassemblers (in .NET) or JS files, etc trying to work out <i>how</i> something works so I can provide the best feedback I can.<p>The other motive is the ""I know what it's like"" feeling being a coordinator on a few projects myself. I know what it's like to have people say ""what doesn't it do X"" or ""why are you doing Y"", it's generally because I don't have time, so if I'm on the other side I am more than happy to try and solve that problem myself. Again this is somewhat related to my first point but really it's a bit more than that. Just because I need a product to do XYZ doesn't mean that that is what everyone wants to do, or what the other contributors are in a position to make it do, so if I've got the skills why don't I tackle it myself?<p>Lastly there's the exposure aspect of it. As much as I'd love to think that everything I do for OSS is altruistic in nature it's not. I like that when I go for a job I can put on my CV that I've contributed to projects so a prospective employer can see my skills as well as just relying on my word.

Not just to learn programming, and various problem domains, but to practise writing and speaking about my work, writing good documentation, and (crucially) practising API design.<p>Making something you're intending to ship to strangers (or to yourself writing future projects with your tools) forces you to write good documentation (if you want anyone to use it), which in turn forces you to hone your API design skills. If you're having trouble writing the docs for something, you probably haven't adequately solved the problem yet.<p>I'm not claiming to have done a great job at this on all my projects, but it's a learning process and occasionally my projects find a user base, which keeps me busy, provides new challenges when they find bugs, and if your code's any good it boosts your reputation as a nice side effect.",1328654826

They don't want their code to be tomorrow's legacy disaster. This makes them care <i>a lot</i> about languages, if we're talking order-of-magnitude differences like Scala vs. Java. If we're talking about Clojure vs. Python, then maybe not.<p>Friends don't let friends maintain Java code.<p><i>No, let's not start the 'Java is slow!!!!' debate again.</i><p>Java is slow to <i>write</i>. And very slow to <i>read</i>. Ever maintain a Java or C++ project? It's glacial. I'm talking about <i>human</i> performance, not runtime speed.<p><i>I think Greenspun is wrong about why this happens. I think it's a sign of weak program design, rather than a weak language.</i><p>I think it's a sign of bad practices. One thing that impels people toward bad practices (and not the only thing) is using the wrong tools.<p>C was designed for simple programs that need tight control over resource use and speed, or that need direct, reliable hardware access. As per the Unix philosophy, these programs were never supposed to become large; they should be modular and communicate through pipes or sockets. For those purposes, it's excellent. But if you have a 250 kLoC C++ program, you're doing something wrong.<p>One causative factor for the Greenspun effect is inappropriate language choice. It's not the only one.<p><i>I think you are wrong about this. I have seen little evidence in my career of a correlation between chosen technology and ability to deliver results.</i><p>""Deliver results"". Here is your problem. A 1.2 programmer can code software to spec, meet deadlines, et cetera. That's an additive effect: cranked it out, met deadlines, went home. The difference between a 1.2 and a 2.0 is the ambition (in the latter) toward multiplier effects-- toward using technology to make whole teams or companies more effective. It's not just about ""results""; it's about what those results are.<p><i>Expanding your definitions to preserve your point is a symptom of fallacious reasoning.</i><p>I guess my point was that it's not accurate to say that 1.5+ programmers always use functional programming, but the weaker claim is true that, for complex tasks requiring high-level languages, they prefer languages that support the functional style.",1328654284

Because the end user cannot run GPL'd software for certain purposes with no strings attached?<p>I'm sure that the point you're raising has been discussed to death in a thousand flamewars, but I happen to be unfamiliar with them. Sorry about that.<p>Could somebody please sketch out how this argument goes? I will outline my understanding so far, and I will use some jargon and concepts from CS, AI, decision theory and economics, please tell me if that makes me harder to understand:<p>A1: Community effort is good when it makes people better off (as opposed to achieving some narrow goal).<p>A2: Most software is community effort, so good software is that which makes people better off. The way to ensure that is to make software free.<p>B2: Free? Then how would programmers gather resources necessary to support themselves why working in a capitalist economy?<p>A3: Free is a toxic word. Let's taboo it. Instead, let's talk about what matters to the user who has already acquired software somehow without hurting the programmer:<p>0. The user has acquired the software without hurting anybody, and it's nobody's business how the software is used, in which manner and to what ends.<p>1. The user has some software but it's not quite enough to accomplish his task, so he creates the solution using everything at his disposal  and that includes other software he has.<p>When software is distributed in a form that impedes understanding and editing it, this actively hurts user who is trying to reprogram or extend the software, which is a legitimate manner of use, because every manner of use is legitimate.<p>2. He wants to help other people (other economic agents), so he uses all the resources at his disposal, including software, to help them. This encompasses sharing software.<p>B3: But this is a very skewed and simplistic view of economy. Sometimes success depends on hindering your competition (cf. minimax). Sometimes you have to hurt other people to secure your freedoms. Sometimes you have to manipulate the market, withhold information, not do everything in your power to reach the declared goal, not take risks, or take unreasonably high risks.<p>A4: So what? There are some fundamental rights, and since they don't <i>necessarily</i> conflict, we should simply avoid situations where they do. When that's not possible, we should seek compromises. In the case of software, the right thing to do is to err on the side of more freedom, because otherwise the equilibrium will fall at the point where no further progress is possible, and we don't want that.<p>B5: Say what you want, but I have I paid job, and my job security depends on me hindering other people's ability to do the same. The best way to do this is not to share the source code I have written. Oh, and by the way, I have an emotional attachment to it, and I cringe to think of somebody messing with it. It is also badly written and I would be ashamed to have it published, but I have no time to clean it up.<p>A5: This is why we can't have nice things.<p>B6: Most of hardware is closed source. There is a lot of nice hardware. Some of the nicest hardware is made by some of the most secretive organizations.

Most of them are much more interested in what they are building, and interested in how they are building it to the extent that it gets in their way or gets in the way of future maintainers. There are those that are much more productive in languages other than Java, but for most the barriers to productivity or delivery time are not the language but the environment. Using a well-supported and mature platform like Java (both the language and the JRE) helps a great deal here, as does the wide variety of libraries and frameworks available in the Java world. The same applies to the .NET platform, and some other mature platforms that are available.<p>Languages like Scala and Clojure blur the line here a bit, because they are 'more powerful' languages on an mature platform. The Java language still holds some benefits over these languages, mostly in it's stability.<p>> but it's not fast<p>No, let's not start the 'Java is slow!!!!' debate again.<p>> Greenspun's Tenth Rule<p>I think Greenspun is wrong about why this happens. I think it's a sign of weak program design, rather than a weak language.<p>> Are there 1.5 and 2.0 programmers in languages like Java? Absolutely. Is it common? No.<p>I think you are wrong about this. I have seen little evidence in my career of a correlation between chosen technology and ability to deliver results. There are some technologies that I don't like or find not to my taste (PHP springs to mind), which have been the basis for some fantastically successful projects.<p>I might admit that the median skill (measured by the ability to deliver effective results) of people who chose Java is lower than those who chose other languages, but my experience suggests that those differences disappear quickly as you move upward.<p>> Disagree, unless you're taking a very strict view of what ""functional programming"" is.<p>Expanding your definitions to preserve your point is a symptom of fallacious reasoning.<p>Engineers chose tools for many reasons, and a good engineer will have a wide set of tools they know and good judgement about which is the best to use. Looking at which tool they happen to have chosen isn't a good indicator of skill - the actual outcomes are much more useful. Is what they built useful? It is maintainable? Was it delivered on time?

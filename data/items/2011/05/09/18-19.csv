What I'm saying is that the home-runs will move over to self-publishing, reducing the profitability of traditional publishing. Say you're a new author, why not release your first book online under a pseudonym and see how it does. If it does ok, why go to a publisher? So now if you're a publisher you have to make do with the authors that need development <i>and</i> you're hoping for Dan Brown sized successes in a market that is tending towards more, not less, diversity. The successes you do find will now be competing in a much broader market that is priced at a fraction of what you're used to. Doesn't seem like a great place to be.<p>> <i>I also firmly reject the notion that ""truly great"" authors will necessarily lower their prices of ebooks when they transition to self-publishing: they will charge whatever price the market will bear.</i><p>The point is that as an author you can charge a third or less of the price and get the same money because there are less middlemen. Since buyers will buy more of your books if they're cheaper you'd be crazy to charge the same price when you move to self-publishing. As a buyer I'll also spend more on books if they're 3$ each than if they're 15$ each so for the industry this may also be a total net gain.",1304967516

The best way is to go round persuading people of your case.<p>If you declare that it's morally alright for folks to break laws just because they happen to disagree with them, then the biggest problem you encounter is that folks' opinions on what laws are unjust are often just plain wrong. For instance, if Fred Bloggs believes that it should be legal to beat up queers, then he's perfectly entitled to that opinion, and to try to use his free-speech rights to persuade others that we ought to change the law so that it's legal to beat up queers. But it doesn't make it on some level okay for him to start beating up queers.<p>Or a more morally neutral example: some people think we should drive on the left, some people think we should drive on the right.

The gold standard is based on the fact that the currency issuer has a certain amount of gold, and each unit of that currency can be redeemed for gold.<p>Bitcoin is based on the fact that there are 21 million bitcoins, period.  The currency IS backed up by itself, by the fact that there are only a finite number available to you.  That is exactly how the Gold Standard works.

2529625,story,,,1,1,baran,"Ask HN: Will an ""EMR App Store"" solve Health IT's problems? ",,"Background:\nIt's no denying that Health IT (HIT) is broken.  Our gov't is putting billions of dollars into an industry which is adding only marginal (if any) value to the end user.  Many argue that HIT can add value, just the current approach does not.  However, as is the case with most enterprise software, legacy software dominates.  This legacy software is not extensible, making it difficult for innovators to create new solutions.<p>SMART Platforms[1] is looking to change this.  The idea is simple.  First, they want to define a standard API to access medical data.  So rather than having to use cryptic data formats such as HL7/CCR/CCDs, SMART defines a consistent API for ALL electronic medical record installations.  The goal is then to SMART-enable EMR installations at either the vendor or customer (eg. hospital) level.  By SMART-enabling the EMRs, they make the connections between the legacy dbs and their API.  With this an HIT application can use the API and not require custom integration work, which is half the battle in HIT.<p>Do they make a compelling enough case for you to jump into Health IT?  Their success is largely contingent upon innovators, such as HN, wanting to develop on their platform.<p>FYI - SMART is currently sponsoring a HIT App challenge [2] for their new platform.  There is an all-star panel of judges including Tufte.  Deadline is the end of this month.<p>[1] www.smartplatforms.org\n[2] http://www.smartplatforms.org/challenge/",1304965077

And I'm sure a number of you will try to nitpick at my posts and convince yourself that ""hellbanning"" me was just, because surely this elite community you're a part of can do no wrong!  You must defend its honor!  But in all seriousness, you won't feel that way when someone ""hellbans"" you by flagging a comment of yours they don't agree with.<p>As it turns out, I just noticed that I can't post a topic (that doesn't immediately go dead) on the matter from the original ""wrongfulban"" account (account #3!) and proxy I had used to discuss it the first time, because a week or so ago when I posted a topic about it, someone basically told me to shut up again and flagged my submission.<p>I would very much appreciate it if I could have my original account (and IP) back to working status.<p>As it turns out, I've had to find yet another proxy to post this because someone (again!!!!) flagged my original... so all posts from that proxy's IP are also now rendered useless.  Please STOP so this can be resolved.  This is a serious issue.",1304964403

It's an assumption so baked into your brain that you accept it implicitly, but it's not a law of physics or anything.<p>Any deviation from the rules of the system is a challenge to those rules.

Its true, I tried to provoke a bit and its not a totally faire comparison.<p>However, its still against the idea of the Internet, when I can only access certain content from certain locations, no?\nAnd its also somehow censorship, though the proper term may be ""regional broadcast rights"". Its true, that the German government does not actively support this, but I don't see them fight it either. For instance they could insist, that different regional broad cast rights, especially online,  should be baned by the WTO. We do similar thing for inter-EU trade all the time.<p>This new law, like so many, who try to come over the backdoor of European law, is definitely on a different level.

It's clear that written communication skills are in rapid decline, and it's easy to place a value on their presence, but stating the problem is much easier than solving it.<p>Modern young technologists mostly hear words spoken and only rarely read more than a few hundred words at a sitting, so they regularly choose one word that sounds like three others and use that word in all cases -- I call this ""homophonitis"" and it's deadly. I can't count the number of comments about my Website I've received that proclaimed, ""I like your sight"" or ""I like your cite"".<p>Adding to the difficulty is the sentiment that correcting a person's grammar or spelling is bad behavior, even though correcting a person's computer code is encouraged. High-quality prose and code are both important to any useful outcome, but even mentioning one of them is disparaged.<p>Solutions are obvious: (a) much more time spent practicing high-quality, bidirectional written communications, (b) much less time spent listening to words spoken. And (c) abandonment of the unspoken rule that we can't correct terrible grammar and spelling. But I don't think this will happen.",1353355034

4805955,comment,4805091,4805854,6,0,TallboyOne,,,"That is indeed true, but the part I left out for brevity is the part about client expectations, which must also be handled. I disagree however that it makes you appear needy. If you ARE needy, you're going to seem needy no matter what you do. I can assure you though the client would rather have you reply sooner than later... just set the expectation that you can drop them at any time (subtly obviously, you wouldn't say that to their face).<p>Consider the following scenario:<p>A) Email exchange which takes 2 days, for a fix to a site... you quote $800 and they hesitate<p>B) An email exchange where you take no more than 2 minutes to reply, even at 11pm. They are happy that you got back to them so quickly, and you quote $2000. They agree.<p>This happens quite a lot in my experience. To the point where it's extremely noticeable and can't be chalked up to coincidence.<p>I just mentioned what works. If your goal is to get a huge amount of work for $100-200 an hour, then replying right away will get you significantly there (skill aside). Everyone waits hours to respond, so it's the norm. If you want to stand out, you need to be outside the norm.<p>As far as being at the mercy of your email, in practice this genuinely doesn't really mean any difference than if I wait. You're still going to write the email, it's just a matter of when. My productivity remains the same. If I'm very deep in a project, chances are I need a break anyway (I'm bad with taking breaks when I need them). If I'm really busy with some other task common sense would be required, obviously there are exceptions.<p>Sidenote: I don't necessarily do this with well-established clients who I've worked with for years.

Which means Microsoft stays on top, in the mindset of the people, and when those countries become developed the people will buy legitimate copies of Windows/Office.<p>Google has this even better on Android. People aren't pirating Android, they're using open source software. And even if that software runs Bing or Yahoo search and the users like Word to Go rather than Google Docs and Outlook.com rather than Gmail, they're still using Android.

You can also get instances for pretty cheap but I have only used them as throw away test instances. Oh, they have free bandwidth between all their datacenters, even between Canada and France as they managed their own transatlantic links.<p>They have a very decent ""private cloud"" offer. The feedback is good but I am a bare metal + Ganeti[1] to manage my VMs kind of person.<p>If you like pure instances, I have also instance running on Gandi[2] infrastructure. My blog made several times the front page of HN and without special caching it handled extremely well the load (in fact, you could barely see the increase in CPU usage in the monitoring graph while seeing a huge increase of the outbound bandwidth).<p>Another good provider is Hetzner[3]. You need to pay attention to the server you select (ECC memory or not) but then they are reliable (I had a server with them for 4 years or so without a single issue).<p>In Europe, AWS is in Irland, I suppose it was for tax purpose that they selected this location, but from a latency point of view, this is stupid if you want to deliver packets in the South or East of Europe (and even part of Scandinavia because most of the time your route does IE, NL or FR, and then goes North).<p>Sorry for the long post... but at the end of the day, do your calculations. AWS is great if like Netflix you scale from 20% to 100% during the day[4] (the hit on the cache gives you how they scale) but if you are a normal shop without day/night activity because you are at global level or so well optimized that you just not need to scale (a single dedicated server with SSD is incredibly powerful nowadays) you simply do not need ""the cloud"". Just test with 1k, do a bit of maths, then select the best choice.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://notes.ceondo.com/ganeti/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notes.ceondo.com/ganeti/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.gandi.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gandi.net/</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.hetzner.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hetzner.de/</a>\n[4]: <a href=""http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/01/ephemeral-volatile-caching-in-cloud.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/01/ephemeral-volatile-cachi...</a>",1353352707

I'm not always proud of my talkativeness, but let me try to explain why we act the way we do.<p>For extroverts, social interaction energizes us. I'm almost like a vampire if I'm around introverted people. It may be the difference between tribal vs. modern relationships, but in many big families (generally with less income, but not always the case), you need to say something loudly and constantly to get what you want.<p>We also tend to feel noise is comfortable. I've lived in urban areas, where if there isn't noise, it is discomforting if not dangerous. You may have felt the same way at a get-together when there isn't any background music or when you meet a stranger for the first time.<p>For many people in this world, they have the TV on all the time or music blaring 24/7. I'm not saying it's more productive. God knows watching tv while doing anything beyond rote tasks is not a recipe for success, but it makes the task more bearable.<p>As to why we're loud... sometimes it's opinion, sometimes it's emotional release, while other times it's just social pruning. It doesn't mean that we're not thinkers though, it just means we think out loud. It was a key difference between me and another friend I had an argument with, where I wanted to talk it out and she wanted to run away and breathe for a bit.<p>For us, noise/discussion is just as important to the Quiet Ones as quiet.<p>P.S. one caveat, I need quiet when I'm writing, working, reading, or even watching a movie, so I'm not the typical type.",1353352679

Windows RT could have then simply been the most minimal core components of regular Windows to get the Metro add-on running.<p>In fact, with the exception of the Start menu mess up, most of the Metro UI features already do look and behave like add-ons when in desktop mode. Also, if I recall correctly, all the Windows Runtime libraries are pretty standalone and layered on top of Win32 as is.<p>It's unfortunate for Microsoft that they did not take this approach, it would have probably prevented most of the negative reception their new OS has gotten thus far.

I've hired several ""third world country"" developers at US market rates (not Silicon Valley rates; more like midwestern rates, like $30-$50/hour) because they were <i>good</i>.  And, I've passed on $10/hour developers because they didn't convince me they could do the job. It's about value, not price.<p>That's not to say you aren't at a disadvantage, if you're wanting to charge very high rates while being in a third world country, but it's not impossible. Doing the same things suggested by this post, and by other comments, is how you raise your value. You may be raising it from a lower starting point, but it can be raised, and there isn't really a firm upper bound on how high it can go.",1353351921

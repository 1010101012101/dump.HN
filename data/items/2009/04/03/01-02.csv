Its gone from ""Ooh, I can afford to buy myself a Wii"" to ""Oh, erm, it appears that I made more sleeping than I did while awake three weeks out of four last month"".<p>I've blogged pretty regularly about it.  See profile.<p>My advice: find a job which is OK with you having a side business.  I have an arrangement with my company that is mutually beneficial: I firewall my extracurriculars from the day job, I bring them the stuff I learn about engineering and business, they wish me the best of success and officially ignore the existence of my ""personal hobby"".<p>Make a business which is designed to have returns which are super-scalar to your time investment.  I am religious about automating, outsourcing, or eliminating just about anything that I have to do more than once in a blue moon, even if it only takes me 5 or 10 minutes to do manually.  My entire life is a series of 5 minute increments and I don't want to waste any licking stamps.  (Somebody does that for me these days.)<p>Remember that there are more important things in life than working.  If you neglect them, the lack will bite you in the hindquarters, both in more important respects and in impacting your work/business.",1238723999

I don't know how far away in the evolutionary family tree they might have gone with these ""other species.""<p>2) ""Adam sought out gaps in the metabolism model, specifically orphan enzymes, which scientists think exist, but which haven't been linked to any parent genes. After selecting a desirable orphan, Adam scoured the database for similar enzymes in other organisms, along with the corresponding genes. Using this information, it hypothesized that similar genes in the yeast genome may code for the orphan enzyme.""<p>Here it explained that it's not really a hypothesis. Well, it is in the sense that the hypothesis is 'X gene codes for the orphan enzyme.' Then it could test it having been programmed to do laboratory work (presumably) to do so.<p>I say ""it's not really a hypothesis"" because I would have considered the hypothesis of the broader experiment to be something along the lines of 'Proteins/Enzymes for whom we don't know which genes code may be coding for metabolism."" Then the experiment is ""find all such proteins and test them.""<p>3) ""Still chugging along on its own, it designed experiments to test its hypotheses, and performed them using a fully automated array of centrifuges, incubators, pipettes, and growth analyzers.""<p>I don't know anything about the lab work, but before this part happens I gather:\n a) Adam knows what genes it's looking at (it found them, after all)\n b) It looks at those genes being turned into proteins (following the Central Dogma - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biol...</a>)\n c) Using thermodynamics or some aspect of chemistry, it can determine if those proteins play a role in metabolism.<p>Hope that helps.

Oh well -- working on it, one day at a time.<p>The guy next to me at the day job is actually planning a B2C startup, after being inspired by a lot of the US Web 2.0 darlings, particularly the B2SMB ones, and the absurdly easy replace-your-salary-math when you're a 20 or 30-something Japanese engineer.  I honestly believe that that realization could rock this country.

She just assumes that you can make the leap from her <i>Fountainhead</i> characters.<p>That said, <i>Atlas</i> is the more epic novel, and it's a conclusion in a lot of ways to the battle started in <i>The Fountainhead</i>. It's poorly-written, but in terms of pure pulp enjoyment there's nothing to beat it. That's why people get addicted to it: it lays out a fairly complex philosophical idea and attaches pirates, Spanish conquistadors, sci-fi weaponry, mad scientists, and - of course - all-American capitalists into the fray, and lets it culminate in lots of really fulfilling scenes that are terrific fun if you're okay with ignoring poorly-written stuff. It's a quagmire of a book, with several awful chapters leading up to two or three incredible moments - the ribbon-cutting of the train, the court scene with Rearden, the Galt's Gulch chapter - and those are the moments that stick in mind, especially the first handful of times you read the book.<p>So I say ""fine"" meaning ""not terrible"", which I know is a horrible corruption of the idea behind ""fine"". <i>Atlas</i> is worth a read for people who liked <i>The Fountainhead</i>, and it offers stuff that book doesn't have to offer, even if it's not as good a novel.",1238720460

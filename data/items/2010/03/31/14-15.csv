Granted I would rather not have to support older browsers for a number of reasons but the fact is that supporting it hasn't been terribly difficult. With the javascript and css frameworks that are available, compatibility is much less of an issue. We recently rebuilt our site and had to include support for IE6. While developing the site we mainly looked at IE8, Firefox 3.5, Safari 4, and Chrome. Only at the end did we look at IE6 and I believe I had to create 1 stylesheet that has probably less than 30 lines of CSS to fix a few minor visual issues (mainly dealing with widths, margins, and paddings). It took me less than a day. Yes I wish IE6 would fade much faster than it seems to be but I think it is overblown on how hard it is to support.",1270046731

1231869,comment,1231253,1231711,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> My point is that he hasn't given any reason to think that tax / person really is a better statistic for any purpose.<p>It's valuable to look at different statistics in metrics in most endeavors. No statistics are perfect, but it's good to check out different ones. Take baseball, for instance. You have batting average (the percent of times a hitter gets a hit) and you have runs scored (runs are baseball's equivalent of ""points"" or ""goals"" for people unfamiliar; you win by having more runs than your opponent). The usual way people look at tax burden is looking at percent of GDP - batting average, so to speak. But it's also worthwhile to look at runs scored.<p>Why is that? Well, maybe batting average isn't the only way to win games. Baseball used to be obsessed with batting average, but neglected a more subtle and advanced statistic called ""on base percentage"" for years. If you did an analysis of runs scored, you'd find you need on base percentage more than batting average. If you did an analysis of taxation that showed that you could have higher tax yields without taxing a higher percentage of GDP, that'd be well worth knowing.<p>At the very least, it's a number worth looking at.<p>> Perhaps it's something like this.... so demotivation is, so to speak, a function of income; so to measure how demotivated our workers are by tax we should look at their taxes in absolute terms.<p>Actually, the largest reason taxes reduce GDP isn't motivation. It's that the government doesn't invest in the same thing as individuals. When you take taxes from, say, Sergey Brin, and put them under the control of the Senate, that money is going to be spent differently. Brin's money is far more likely to grow the GDP of the United States for the future than whatever the Senate spends it on. The Senate funds some things that produce returns (quality infrastructure, science), some things that help maintain things (a bit of law enforcement, courts), and then a lot of things that don't produce returns. Individuals reinvest in productive endeavors at a much greater rate. Taxation moves resources from the control of people who are more interested in reinvesting and growing their investments to politicians, who are primarily interested in getting re-elected.<p>> the purpose of taxation is to provide the people with benefits<p>The purpose of taxation is to increase the revenues that the taxing authority collects. How those revenues are spent are up to the authority. Some governments provide benefits to the people, some buy weapons and try to take over their neighbors, some just steal the money outright. Taxation is sold as providing benefits to the people, but that's not necessarily how the tax yields are spent.<p>> 1... 2... 3... 4...<p>I agree with some of those arguments, disagree with others. But the main point is he's not offering a Swiss Army Knife that measures everything, he's just pointing out another number we can look at and take into consideration. To go back to baseball, it's good to look at batting average, on base percentage, isolated power, runs scored, pitches taken, and a number of other factors - there's some great players that have a low average and low on base, but hit with lots of power so they're good. All things being equal, you'd like to have your players take more pitches and wear the other side out. There's a hidden value in a player that takes 1 extra pitch per appearance even if he's just an average player - he'll take 4-5 extra pitches a game, which might mean wearing the opposing pitcher out who has to be taken out. That means your teammate will face a worse pitcher. If you can get a full team of players that take a lot of pitches, you might see spend 10% of the game facing the opposing team's worse reliever when the guy who started the game gets tired and has to be taken out very early.<p>But if you said - ""let's only look at pitches taken"", you'd be crazy, because it's useless by itself. If you said, ""let's only look at runs scored"" you'd be crazy, because it's also about how your teammates do after you get on. But that doesn't mean you should only look at batting average either - or you won't have a complete picture. It's worth looking at all the numbers, so I'm happy this number was brought up for thinking about.",1270046286

It actually monitors your system for changes to protected data in realtime, and queues the files for backup. The nice thing about it is, you just configure it and forget it, it'll perform automated near-realtime backups on its own. You only use it when you need it: to revert changes and undelete files.<p>Anyway, I'd really appreciate any feedback you guys can give on the product. There's a lot going on behind the ostensibly simple UI, and sometimes focusing too hard on the core means missing out on the big picture.

At rates that high, some shielding is required, or the cable will pick up enough noise to damage the signal.  The HDMI link has some error correction (contrary to a comment on that site) whereby 8 data bits are transmitted using 10 bits on the wire, so minor errors are tolerated.<p>The important thing, and the central argument of that article, is that with a digital link, once there are no bit errors, no further improvements can be made, and even a cheap cable is plenty good enough for a short HDMI connection.  Gold-plated connectors are still a good idea.

Just kept getting ""401 Unauthorized"" over and over. Still haven't figured it out. (The worst part has to be that I was using a library and serious debugging ended with me following the instructions on the tutorial step-by-step; I still got the error...).<p>My question: Why should this app take 2 hours? Why shouldn't this take 2 minutes? All it is is a little form that stores the number of push-ups you did and the week. Why is everything so hard?

The methods of taxation, and the benefits provided, are different across countries.<p>Europeans pay higher taxes. They also get a lot more in terms of government services. I'd gladly pay 7-10% more in taxes for cheap transporation, free healthcare, and free higher education in this country.<p>Few Europeans, except for rich right-wing assholes, seriously complain that they pay too much in taxes (aside from the nonspecific gripe that everyone has against taxes). If anything, we pay too much in taxes in the US when you consider how little we get and how much is squandered (e.g. the Iraq war).",1270044366

We are more vulnerable when we are entrenched in a proprietary model. In the long run, it will be things like cloud computing, semantic analysis of your output, and even outright spying. Things are already pretty bad right now, and will be worse over time if we don't fight that lucrative model.<p>(2) In the case of popular software, where a popular alternative already exist, I do (although even if I am wrong, (1) is way more important). Also, I suspect you can't use OpenOffice because you are used to word. My brother, who is not so used to Word, actually prefer OpenOffice. It is a bit like 3DsMax vs Blender. I know no one who learned one first and liked the other.<p>Now, it should be clear why a non-tech person should be able to tell proprietary format from free ones: it is about a very basic, universal concept: freedom. So they'd better learn the necessary technical skills before they lose their freedom.<p>This has happened before. When most people didn't know how to read, those who did had a tremendous edge. They could access more ideas, and therefore have more choice, more freedom. The printing press magnified this effect, and ultimately lead to the generalization of democracy in the western world. The catch is, you have to learn to read before you benefit that. And until you do, you will have a hard time to see the need.",1270044356

VCs are ""supposed"" to be the ones who can pick out the good deals; that's why they get paid their high salaries.

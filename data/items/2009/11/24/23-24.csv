960249,comment,959165,959644,0,0,wallflower,,,"In the homework we do for engineering classes, we would be able to make simplifications without fundamentally altering the problem. For example a continuous load on a structure could be modeled as a single force vector because G, the gravitational force always acts downwards. You can't do that in software with loosely-coupled, autonomous modules. These modules do not obey anything. Just an implicit contract that can be broken easily. Unit tests only help to clarify the contract for a module or between modules. In structural engineering, there are a lot of unknowns but they can be modeled across the entire range because there are many known constants. The load-bearing capacity of the beam, the moment (the twisting force acting on the beam). Virtual abstractions like software do not obey physical rules. Because they are virtual. You can create a Castle in the Air in your program world, if you like. Hard physical reality has real constraints. Virtual reality has flexible constraints. Physical reality is one of the reasons building construction is a solved problem. The irony is with sophisticated software, architects like S. Calatrava and F. Gehry can begin to create almost Castles in the Air.",1259106760

960222,comment,960066,960066,0,0,hn,,,"The author missed two key selling points of web apps. Firstly, users don't need to install to use web apps. They just need to open whatever browser and go to whatever url and the app is already there. Imagine if users have to install 100 desktop apps to have the same set of features which 100 websites offer. It's normal before the web era but ridiculous now. Secondly, web apps enable extremely fast iterating development and release. You can ship new versions as quick as you want, no delay, no real downloads, absolutely transparent to users. Essentially web apps and desktop apps are the same in the sense that they both depend on APIs. Web apps depend on remote APIs and desktop apps depend on local/native APIs. The more local dependency you can remove, the more powerful the apps can be. Therefore, web apps are much more powerful than desktop apps and desktop apps making uses of public APIs such as Twitter APIs, Facebook APIs are somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.",1259106017

I suppose they deserve to be called out just for being insufferable douchebags, but there is one very important issue being ignored:<p>The web is a true open standard in a time when computerized technology is crossing the chasm and increasingly the powers that be will seek to control everything in order to squeeze whatever profit they can out of it at the expense of all future progress.  I don't really believe companies like Apple are the real problem, but over time, proprietary platforms will provide opportunities for mega-corporations to lock in consumers.  Up until 20 years ago or so it was very hard to get any kind of lock-in because it was still mostly early adopters and hackers who owned computers.  However once the majority of the world is online, software matures and hardware becomes more complex to manufacture, the inertia of existing technologies will make it harder and harder for disruptive technology to get a foothold.<p>That is why even though the web is inferior to native APIs by numerous qualitative measures, we need to support the web and really push for more ""native"" APIs to be build on top of standard tech like javascript (where feasible), and also continue pushing standards to improve.",1259105919

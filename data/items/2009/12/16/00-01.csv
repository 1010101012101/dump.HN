What I do know is that some of Gore's science is spotty, but that malaria may indeed be affected by any sort of climate pattern changes.  I've done only a bit of traveling in my life, but I think it can hardly be disputed that there are more mosquitoes in Florida than there are in NY, and more in NY than there are in California.<p>The question then is: will global warming increase the primary factor and secondary factors that contribute to mosquito breeding?  Those factors are clearly water/humidity first, and warmth second.  California has few mosquitoes because it's cold when it's wet and it's dry when it's warm, and Florida has a lot because it's got warmth and water aplenty.<p>So then, the answer is complicated.  Some places will see an increase in malaria prevalence and some places will see a decrease, due to the varying effects of climate change.  California is set to be drier and warmer, so we shouldn't have any increase.<p>But that's the twist.  Some places are poised to become wetter and warmer, as opposed to drier and warmer.  Thus, places that don't normally experience it will experience it (or at least be plagued by mosquitoes).  The authorities in those places won't be prepared for it.  So either way you play it, global warming <i>will</i> cause some issues.",1260924431

They are all-cash stores, with an occasional ATM machine in the store. Every single element of the store has an efficiency study behind it.

If McDonald's did the market research to say that this location was good, then it's good enough for WH too.<p>I use the WH Method for my choices on fashion (when I bother to care about fashion): I pick a celebrity who looks rather well put together and similar to me in build, reason that celebrities are required to spend an inordinate amount of attention on fashion in order to maintain their marketability, and then wear/style however they do. It works out rather well.<p>I've also used the WH Method for doing basic site design in a documentation-happy environment.

Using the purported Apple-logic from this post, Apple is (indirectly) paying for that too, so shouldn't they be able to monitor those connections as well?<p>A utility argument here, I don't believe is the way to approach this.  There are all sort of ""useful"" things that companies could do that most folks would agree cross the line into invasion of privacy, in the US or elsewhere.<p>I think there are two important assumptions I'm working with:<p>- People have a right to privacy in personal affairs<p>- The work place being only for work is an idealization that in practice does not exist<p>My argument won't make sense if you don't agree on those two.<p>Employment is one of the fundamental elements of the social fabric, and the rights of employers and employees are participant to a more general social contract.  There exists a line at which a company must sacrifice some utility to uphold its end of that contract (e.g. they can't make people work 12 hour shifts, 7 days a week, even if they think it'd boost output), and as employers have an imbalance of power in negotiating employment terms, the government, in the interest of the people, lays down some guidelines for what the minimum boundaries are.  Every developed country has this.  The only variant is the extent of those stipulations, not their existence.<p>I believe the right to privacy is important enough that it's something that an employee <i>should not</i> be obliged to forfeit it in an employment contract.  And since it's clear that personal and professional spheres overlap in the workplace, no, I don't think the company should have unrestricted access to an employee's data or actions in the workplace or through work-provided mediums.  I don't think there should be microphones in every room; I don't believe that all thoughts discussed in the coffee corner are thusly entitled to the company.  Even if they did buy the coffee and the chairs and are paying you at that time.  And for me, and the legislators of many (most?) western countries, that clearly extends to internet access and company cell phones.",1260922926

In many circumstances, if an employee points out the problem, they are ignored or criticized for making things ""more difficult"".<p>People don't care.  Once the records have no value to them, they want to be rid of them as expediently as possible.  And/or they haven't been taught to even consider the matter.  It's only when people are actively incentivised to handle things differently (good management and operations education and practice, or punitive incentives against negligent behavior), that they go to the trouble of ensuring proper disposal.<p>Again, my personal experience has been:  People are busy and/or don't care.  They want the stuff gone with minimum fuss so that they can get back to what matters for them.  ""Who's ever going to look in that dumpster?""  There's also a lot of cognitive ""not my problem"", in my observation.<p>I mention this because if you are a stickler for handling important things correctly, such as security, learning the above is an important first step.

997747,comment,997698,997698,0,0,city41,,,"I've been using MonoDevelop 2.2 builds quite a bit on OSX for developing in MonoTouch. I have very mixed feelings about it (and granted, I haven't tried the final 2.2 release yet, but all builds leading up to it).<p>MonoDevelop is a nice, lighter weight Visual Studio clone. VS users will feel at home right away. Its intellisense is quite good (just as good as VS's), it's refactoring is nice, most features are either as good as VS or better. For example when you do a replace, it highlights in your current document all instances of your find string to give you a better sense of what the replace is about to do. There are lots of little touches like that that I really like a lot.<p>On OSX at least though, GTK# has some issues. Often times the window ignores mouse clicks, and this is a massive roadblock to using the app efficiently. To fix this you have to cause a refocus to happen, such as focus a different app then come back to MD or focus a different part of MD. If the final release didn't fix this (and I reported this bug), then that's a huge deal breaker. This problem really hurts productivity and workflow. I also don't like how MD doesn't work with apps like SizeUp, and how dialogs are not modal. For example, the find in files dialog is not modal, so after you use it, it can go behind the main window. Then from then on the key command to invoke it seems to do nothing, as the window is still around. You have to go behind the main window and close it.<p>TLDR: On OSX, a nice IDE that is very VS-like with some nice added touches, but has some UI issues that can really hamper it.",1260922147

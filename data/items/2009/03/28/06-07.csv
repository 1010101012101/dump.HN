Though from what it sounds like it's not the computer itself that's the major cost in the lab, it's all the support that goes into it.",1238223378

536258,comment,536181,536181,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"PlinkPlonk says ""My heartfelt wish is that these junk articles don't make the front page of HN. So what's next on HN? raising children? ""<p>This is not a junk article. And yes, articles about raising kids were published here and I do not remember any one questioning if it was hacker news. ( <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/lies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/lies.html</a>). This is intellectually interesting and useful. If hacker news wants to be a community where human beings take part rather than some large drone feeding me with 'programming' news this article stays.<p>For that matter this article has more insight than many articles about 'ruby' on this site, I cringe when articles get in just because it had the word 'programming' in it. There are many programming articles that were a pure waste of time, did not embody what hackers are about. Hacker is an attitude and not just programming. Hacker is the quality in programming and not just the programming. Just dealing with programming is not an automatic pass to be hacker news (some sites are actually banned!), and by the same account just that something does not contain the word programming does not mean its not hacker news.<p>Guess what, we are programmers and proud ones. But I personally value my relationships more than my programming abilities (And my girl friend will never say to me: if you love me stop programming!, she loves me too. Its a nice arrangement. :P).<p>The fear or the question ""If we let this article where will this stop?"" reminds me of people who ask: If we let gay people marry, then where will this stop ? If you felt pity for such people who did not have a good appreciation for dynamic nature of all things nature, then think a bit more. ""Where will this stop?""is not reason enough and is not an automatic pass to raise the objection ""this is not hacker news""<p>There is room here for more insight. Further I said this some 2 years back on this site: I will say it again. Dont have a very narrow view of what you are. Don't define yourself and put  your self in such a tiny box ""I am a hacker because I think ruby is not a gem"". I feel kinship to the person who designs good buildings and the one who designs a good meal which is also cheap. In such a meal I see a succinct program which also is very efficient in terms of memory.<p>There are insights to be obtained from all of them for programming itself.  Further only if you expand  your world view and talk about problems people face on a daily basis can you obtain insights into peoples problems that need solutions. And guess what you will suddenly find a new business instead of hacking together your one millionth web based todolist with email and sms feature.<p>EDIT: adding link to the earlier comment that I refer to <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31799"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31799</a> which was made looong back.",1238221893

Not overwhelmingly so, but it's certainly not a junk article.""<p>fair enough. differing perceptions and all that. I think (note: <i>I</i> think) it was a trashy article, not worth my time I spent in reading it  (which is my working definition of ""junk"") and <i>I</i> don't want to see such articles on the front page so I did my part by  (a) flagging it (b) explaining my thought process.<p>It is upto the rest of the HN community to confirm or reject my perception. And I am completely  fine with that. I can always start reading from teh second article from the top :-)<p>PS: I noticed that the article disappeared from the front page(""Dead"" ed) and then came back a few minutes later. How does that happen? Just curious.",1238220825

536253,comment,536244,536244,0,0,arupchak,,,"This is one of the few blogs that I actually keep up with on a regular basis. I used to work at this hospital as an RA before I left in 2007.<p>Over the past few weeks, the CEO has been holding meetings with his employees openly about their financial constraints and layoffs. If you go back a few posts, you will see that many employees even leave comments on the blog about the topic.<p>One idea he presented to his employees was to 'protect' the lower wage earners. While, from a budget standpoint, it is straight-forward to layoff a higher wage earner, he presented the overall idea to his employees in such a way, that everyone rallied around the idea. Employees willingly gave up certain benefits in order to reduce layoffs across the hospital.",1238220420

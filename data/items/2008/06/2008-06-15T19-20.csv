If you give Africans (for example) their Levels 1 and 2, in 20 years you'll have a tripled population that's just as destitute and dysfunctional as before, if not more.<p>It's the food and medicine programs that are ""feel good"". Without reducing African birthrates (which are the highest in the world), they probably only make things worse in the long run.",1213559891

It the tanks could be small enough to be operated at the household level, then perhaps one enterprising neighbor could buy the neighborhood detritus or offer to convert it for them.<p>Even if it's not competitive price-wise there is significant value for (some) people in feeling environmental; burning carbon negative gas in your car from your yard would probably fit that category.",1213557548

218166,comment,218021,218021,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Although my family was very poor, I was lucky to grow up in a school district where there were a few computers here and there.  I spent countless hours neglecting boring schoolwork in order to get access to any kind of computer I could and I graduated from high school with poor grades in everything except math and physics.  However I taught myself basic, pascal, fortran, cobol, ibm jcl, Z80 and 6502 assembler without ever owning a computer of my own.  It doesn't surprise me at all that computers had the effect of distracting kids from academic goals because that's exactly what happened to me.<p>I can't imagine the school teachers and administrators took into account the possibility of the computer voucher program when they designed their curriculums.  However my nascent computer skills got me the jobs I needed to earn the money to be the first in my family to graduate from college.",1213556694

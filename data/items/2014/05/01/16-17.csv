But in reality ideas almost never get stolen! They arise independently, sure, and on a long enough time line good ideas will be acted on, but in the near-term this is almost <i>never</i> the case.<p>The situation for scientists is exactly the same. On a timeline of writing papers (3 years from original research, say 5 papers). No one is going to steal your data and get it published first! It <i>could</i> happen, and so people are afraid. But it <i>won&#x27;t</i> because your data is hard to interpret, and people are lazy and they people have their own data anyway.<p>There needs to be pressure from a lot of different places to get the point across, but the reality is that sharing is <i>ultimately</i> a great resource for everyone but in the <i>near term</i> not a threat to your ability to publish!",1398963577

7680972,comment,7679116,7680692,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Validation in two different languages is solved by defining your models using a framework that supports proper validation. Moreover, you should do that for all application. Don&#x27;t make me wait for your server to respond to know that I mistyped a credit card number. Validation on the client side and on the server side is a solved problem and if your application has any significant amount of validation code compared to all of your code, your application is way too simple.<p>It is old fashioned. It&#x27;s also backwards when it comes to mobile apps. Phones and tablets have lots of horsepower, but bandwidth is low and more importantly latency is high. I can almost buy that when you expand a menu the whole page reloads if it happens over Google Fiber and your server adds no latency, but when the roundtrip to the server takes 2-3 seconds, I am not using your app.<p>I will repeat: if you are running a mostly static website, HTML + HTTP is the way to go. There are still plenty of web apps that work just fine that way (basic CRUD mostly). However, there is a category of apps that are much better served by running client side with a well-defined API to the server. This provides you with a true MVC setup and makes for much cleaner code. Trying to put together a JavaScript driven app where you reload pages is something I have experienced quite a bit over the past decade. It&#x27;s such a pain that it should not be attempted. Angular and friends make single page apps viable and much easier than the jQuery + HTML + Ajax apps.<p>I don&#x27;t blame you for disliking JavaScript: it&#x27;s an odd little language with some really bad parts. Perhaps try one of the other languages that compiles down to JS? I hear CoffeeScript is very nice.",1398963044

Lessig <i>sucks</i> at rhetoric. Most liberals do. It&#x27;s the one point where I feel shame at being a liberal.<p>If you take a look at his blog post, it&#x27;s all about money. The only words that talk about the <i>problem</i> are &quot;fundamental change.&quot; And while &quot;change&quot; can work as a rhetorical grounding, it is overplayed, and he&#x27;s not using it well.<p>No he needs to demonize the opposition and create a sense of unity in his community of supporters. To one degree or another this is how all political change happens.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d do.<p>Buying our Freedom.<p>Abraham Lincoln, when faced with the impossible evil of Slavery, sought not war, but peace. He sought to buy the freedom of slaves, to pay fair for the freedom of men. Today we are faced with the equally impossible evil of democracy bought and sold in the halls of washington. Corporations hold enslaved our senators and congressmen and they do it through money. Campaign contributions, superpacs, the corruption of greed grips our government, and government for the people has become degrading servitude to big money.<p>Lincoln and the good people who believed in freedom and unity for this country were eventually forced into war, but first there was the attempt at reason, at working with those who purchased and survived on evil. Today we are on the same path. The evil of money entwined with politics cannot stand. It divides this nation into have&#x27;s and have nots. It deprives the average man of his vote and gives it to the rich man. History will judge the evil of this time as a sad chapter in American history, just as we judge the period of slavery, but before History can pass judgment we must act.<p>Today we will attempt reason, and the language the corrupt understand. We will raise money. We will spend money. And we will do this in defense of democracy, not to control it, but to free it, and give it back to the people.<p>The men and women in washington do not <i>want</i> to be slaves to big money. No one does. But they have no champions, they have no defense. We will be their champions and we will rise up to protect them. We will raise money, and we spend money as a hammer large enough to smash their chains.<p>In the next month we will raise such money and spend such money as to show &quot;big&quot; money where power in America really lies. It is in the hands of the people, and the hands of the people are reaching out to take their government back.<p>In one month we will raise $1 million dollars. Donate now to show them. In 5 months we will raise $5 million dollars. Donate now to free our democracy. And in two years we will raise an army of dollars such that Congress can once and for all throw off its chains. We will buy our freedom, we will have our freedom, or, if forced to it by greed of rich men, we will fight.<p>Donate now.",1398962874

If the core foursquare app becomes focused on location discovery and exploration, they instantly become the most viable mobile competitor to Yelp, which is something I (and I think many people) would be interested in.<p>They&#x27;re recognizing that the location browsing/discovery UX is fundamentally different than their social UX, and de-coupling them, while presumably using the same infrastructure under the hood. Hopefully, this will allow UI/UX development that diverges and serves each user group better.<p>I want a better, more usable location database on my phone, I would use it all the time. Yelp is unfortunately the default, I think because through crowd-sourcing data validation, they just have the most accurate listing of addresses, phone numbers, business hours, etc. But after that, Yelp is social features I don&#x27;t care for, review writing that make me sad about humanity, and very likely bully-esque business practices (but I do like the pictures). Foursquare has the second best location DB that I&#x27;ve used, but historically the app has been more aggressive about pushing it&#x27;s social features, which I do not want.

The application has to be of some decent complexity, and using tools that an average developer using the framework might use.<p>In the end, you could compare the complexity of the code, the average page response time, maintainability/flexibility, and the time it took to actually develop the app and the results could let developers know what they sacrifice or what they gain by using one framework over the other. I know a lot of these metrics could reflect the developer themselves vs the actual framework, but it might also be a tool to let you know what an average developer, given a weekend, might be able to produce. It would also help me to see an application written a ton of different ways -- so I can make good decisions about what framework to choose based on my needs.<p>In the end, speed only tells us so much -- and speed is not the only metric that we consider when we write applications -- otherwise it looks like most developers would be coding their web apps in Gemini.",1398961989

We have an algorithm that we&#x27;ve developed over years that is constantly changing in subtle (and not so subtle) ways to make filling more accurate. Some of the biggest changes in a long time will be coming in the 4.2 version of the browser extension, currently in beta.<p>But you&#x27;re right, sites and their password change processes differ greatly. Some require the old password, some require only the new password. Some only require the new password once (admittedly rare).<p>I think at best though we&#x27;d only be able to do this if we went to the password change page for the site and attempted to fill the data in for changing the password.

Note I haven&#x27;t extensively used Gradle, this is just from research:<p>- Intellij has incredible Maven support, and by this point almost all the bugs have been worked out.  Gradle support is improving, but our company has dozens of modules, a mix of Java / Clojure source code, and depends heavily on Intellij automatic source linking working correctly, dependency propagation working 100% successfully, etc, and it&#x27;s really easy for small bugs to become blockers.  Last I checked there were still a number of pretty frustrating bugs related to this<p>- The Jenkins maven plugin is great, and the Gradle one is mediocre.  For example, it does not even handle automatic triggering of downstream builds (this is absolutely critical for us <a href=""https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19941"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19941</a>)<p>- Gradle pretty decent plugin support by now, but is not yet as exhaustive as what you&#x27;ll find with Maven (there&#x27;s a maven plugin for basically everything now)<p>- This may have been resolved, but I had issues configuring getting Gradle to update snapshot dependencies, which was really important to us.<p>In the end I decided to migrate to Maven to avoid these headaches.  I think I will try to use Gradle for personal projects, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable migrating our company stack there yet.",1398961873

So, basically, if our goals were not in line with that, we were reprimanded by being told we would not &quot;make it in this society&quot;.

But if you break it down into some important components like &quot;campaign funding&quot; you can find solutions.<p>First of all, who says politicians need to be running expensive advertising campaigns? There are plenty of &quot;pull&quot; channels that don&#x27;t cost anything. There&#x27;s not much of a benefit to democracy for politicians to be buying TV airtime and putting up signs everywhere. Presumably people want to hear what a Presidential candidate has to say.<p>Second, as long as budgets are small it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem to fund it from any number of sources. Some countries have system for using public money. You could limit presidential campaigns to $1m from deposits totaling no more that $100-$1000.<p>This isn&#x27;t even a hard problem.",1398961483

Our dishes are inspired by the individuality, creativity and cultural heritage of our chefs from around the globe. From Dragon Rolls to Braised Brisket, Gobble has something healthy and exciting for everyone. Local families absolutely love the service so far (4.5 stars on Yelp!), and we&#x27;re only just getting started.<p><i>Bay Area Community Manager</i><p>Calling all aspiring and veteran community managers who love cooking and learning about food! We are looking for someone who can be the voice of our exciting company and help us best communicate with our customers.<p>Now, this is where you come in... Our operations are up and running, and it&#x27;s time to go beyond doing the bare minimum. We need a smart, energetic team player to join our team of five as the first ever Gobble Community Manager.<p>We know this title usually suggests some kind of social media management, but this role goes way beyond that. When we say community manager, we mean that you will be the person who represents who we are to the outside world. You will also be responsible for bringing outside input to our team to help us continually improve our product. We want someone who can sit at the team meetings with us as an equal with the founders and really think about what we want to communicate to customers and how we can do better.<p>The kinds of things you&#x27;ll be doing are endless, but here&#x27;s a starter list of duties:<p>* Customer happiness - you will be talking directly with customers every day and making sure they&#x27;re happy with our product. If they&#x27;re not, you&#x27;ll also be the one to help us fix that. You will be the frontline of defense when it comes to making sure we are attending to customers&#x27; needs.<p>* Writing our weekly newsletter - this is our one source of outgoing communication so it&#x27;s pretty important to make sure it conveys exciting product updates and food world content that aligns spot on with our company values.<p>* Incorporating customer feedback into the product - You&#x27;ll be the one hearing all their feedback and making sure we can turn it into actionable product changes.<p>* Whatever occurs to you and whatever comes your way. You are joining an early early stage startup so we expect you to figure out what needs to get done so that we can successfully communicate with our clients and implement it as needed. We also expect you to be flexible and take on any necessary tasks that might not fit your job description.<p><i>Requirements:</i><p>* A bachelor&#x27;s degree. If you don&#x27;t have one, feel free to convince us of why you&#x27;re still a fit.\nTeam spirit. Have we mentioned we&#x27;re a tight-knit group? We want someone who wants to be part of a team and is a good team played and contributor.<p>* Willingness to dive in. We&#x27;re not looking for someone who wants a 9-5 job. This is just not what that is! We want someone who will join us and think and act like a company founder.\nPrecision. We&#x27;re a team that doesn&#x27;t miss a detail or a beat. You should be highly organized and 100% on your game at all times.<p>* Previous experience in a writing role. Whether it&#x27;s newsletters, emails, blog posts, or your college newspaper, you can quickly create content for our customers that is both creative and clear.\nPrevious experience in a people-facing role. Maybe you worked at an ice cream store one summer, or you worked in communications at a non-profit, or you made sales calls for a past startup. Grace under pressure is the key to success here.<p>* Excitement to join an early-stage company. Early-stage companies are a world of their own. They&#x27;re small and hectic, and it takes someone who loves this environment to succeed in it.\nExperience working at a startup is preferred, but not required. It would be helpful if you&#x27;ve been in this environment before and know what it&#x27;s about.",1398961452

For example, you can mark the interface of a class as @Transactional, and all your implementations will get the behavior.",1398961248

If FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t bump a package and PRs take a whiiiiile, I bump that thing in my overlay.<p>poudriere allows me to build (in bulk) all my relevant packages in jails, is clever enough to rebuild just the stuff that changed (or where I changed the config) and spits out a directory structure that represents a pkgng repository with (optional) signed binary packages.<p>pkgng is pointed to my repository (actually it supports multiple sources, apt like. Can PKG_PATH do that?), which contains now builds from upstream ports and my overlay.<p>How would I (hoping that you have a couple of minutes and can prove me wrong once more)<p>- build binary packages for ports that either don&#x27;t exist upstream (stuff I ported) or are outdated upstream?<p>- distribute those in a decent way (PKG_PATH swapping..?)<p>I guess I&#x27;m left with the question whether we&#x27;re talking about the same thing when we&#x27;re saying &#x27;decent binary packages&#x27;? I&#x27;m sure you can OpenBSD works well for the intended use - but &#x27;decent&#x27; wasn&#x27;t an objective attribute here, it was more a subjective &#x27;decent for my needs&#x27; kind of thing. More details above.<p>In the end, pkg_* feel like ooold Solaris, or like using Slackware again. That&#x27;s package management on a different level and feels like a step down from apt/yum/pacman/pkgng. Again: Probably it&#x27;s just a matter of convenience and my laziness in the end, but so far I feel that&#x27;s not for me.",1398960845

People simply have learned first to &quot;deep read&quot; with books, so they read/learn easier since they can tap those already familiar (perhaps subconcious) habits without having to figure out new ones. Unfortunately, phone and tablet screens are associated with mindless or at least light reading and aversion, not deep cognition,  so perhaps that&#x27;s why there is some observed deficit in reading on them.<p>Still, I&#x27;m going to accept the &quot;science is not quite settled&quot; part of the article.

Some sort of general app framework that could be fired up.  The main distinction between it and the reader would be that a reader app would assume that it&#x27;s valid at any time to dump state to disk and bail, whereas you could configure an app for how you wanted it to behave (I might want a monitor to be up 24/7/365, while a social networking app could shut down if I haven&#x27;t interacted with it for 15 minutes).",1398960685

More than 90% of Americans link that failure to the influence of money in politics.&quot;<p>Most Americans also think we spend 10x as much money on foreign aid than we do. The cause of the current economic malaise is a factual issue, not a matter of public opinion.<p>I have a sincere question for the people who support Lessig&#x27;s statement quoted above: how can America&#x27;s current woes not be easily explained by deindustrialization and automation reducing the need for labor, thus putting labor in a disadvantageous position relative to capital?<p>I go into CVS or Wal-Mart, and see everyone using automated checkout machines with a few cashiers hanging around in case anything goes wrong. Ten years ago, those didn&#x27;t exist, and there would be a long row of cashiers. Is campaign finance really responsible for the woes of the middle and lower class, or is it technology (and other factors that make Americans of average skill more fungible)?<p>I wonder if the focus on campaign financing doesn&#x27;t mistake correlation for causation. I think people mistake the degree to political decisions are caused by the money, rather than the preferences being communicated through the money. For example, if you&#x27;re a big corporation with hundreds of employees in a Congressman&#x27;s district, you might advertise in support of him, to communicate the message that raising taxes will lead to reduced employment. What causes that Congressman to vote against raising taxes? The money that was spent, or the message that was communicated with that money?<p>I guess the bottom line is that rich people and corporations don&#x27;t need to bribe politicians. In the modern economy, where they can replace most workers with machines or outsource most work to China, or even renounce their citizenship and live as an expatriate in Hong Kong, they have all the leverage. They use the money to communicate their preferences to politicians afraid of contravening those preferences.",1398960220

Well clearly <i>someone</i> has to put money into politics or you&#x27;d never see signs up, you wouldn&#x27;t see commercials, politicians wouldn&#x27;t have websites to post their platforms on, etc.<p>It seems to me like what people actually want is better politicians and the influence of money is the current reason to see politicians as poor.  People have always hated politicians though, didn&#x27;t we have Nixon before this big money kick?  What about Herbert Hoover?  Surely he&#x27;d be accused of some corporatist agenda today for his blunders.<p>It seems to me if you don&#x27;t like how politicians behave and are influenced that the solution is to reduce their power and influence.  If, and it&#x27;s a big if, money is the problem, the money will stop flowing if the benefit of spending it drops.  The larger government gets, the more power we give our politicians, and the more beneficial spending that money becomes.  Remove the incentives and this problem will fix itself.  That probably means many more complaints about why we don&#x27;t have specific social programs, research programs, defense budget and whatever else we spend money on, but it&#x27;ll fix the issue of the influence of money.",1398960046

Perhaps I was unclear, but I think that I worded it such that a wide-band device was implied (&quot;wide swath&quot;).<p>Regardless, jammers can be narrow-band or wide-band depending on the goal. The device in the article sounds to be wide-band, but that doesn&#x27;t define the entire category.",1398960045
7680564,comment,7678672,7680478,5,0,avsm,,,"> you have no decent binary packages<p>This is completely incorrect.  OpenBSD has been all about building reproducible binary packages for quite a long time now, and the ports tree is regularly bulk-built and failing ports fixed or swept out of the way.  The key difference from FreeBSD is that OpenBSD binary package sets are released every six months with the base system, and you are expected to upgrade them during a system upgrade.<p>It&#x27;s as simple as `pkg_add -ui` if you point the PKG_PATH to a remote OpenBSD distribution mirror.<p>One advantage of upgrading ports with the base system is that caveats are all conveniently listed in the upgrade guide for that release. E.g. for 5.4->5.5: <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade55.html#Pkgup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade55.html#Pkgup</a>",1398960040

It moves pretty slow when explaining both Haskell and the financial content.  To be fair, this might be considered an advantage if you are new to both.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t really give you alot of &quot;actionable code&quot; that you can drop into an existing system.  Each chapter is an introduction to large subjects, so I guess by definition the author can&#x27;t dive very deeply.<p>In contrast the posted book seems to cover a bit more ground and seems to include on graphing and practical applications of black scholes, which is nice.<p>I&#x27;ll post a review once I&#x27;ve read it.",1398960035
7680562,comment,7679372,7680380,5,0,rst,,,"Among kerosene/oxygen rockets, the RD-180 gets an unusually high amount of propulsive kinetic energy per unit of fuel (technically, high specfic impulse), in part due to a more efficient combustion cycle (staged combustion), and in part due to very advanced materials science the Russians have, that the US hasn&#x27;t matched.  (And other engines with similar performance are also Russian:  the RD-170, which is signficantly larger than the RD-180; the NK-33, which is quite a bit smaller...)<p>There is an American manufacturer that has licensed the RD-180 design, and technically has the rights to build them here, but they haven&#x27;t --- and since that would involve duplicating Russian metallurgy, there&#x27;s some skepticism that they could.  (At a recent Senate hearing, it was the head of ULA(!) who said the Russian design did &quot;things we found that our textbooks said were impossible&quot;.)<p>If you&#x27;re asking why ULA can&#x27;t just buy something else from, say, Pratt and Whitney, then the short answer is, &quot;they don&#x27;t sell anything that fits on an Atlas V&quot;.  Think about trying to use the engine from a VW bug (or a large truck) to replace the engine in a pickup:  even if the fuels are the same (and you can&#x27;t take that for granted!), the fittings and performance characteristics are different enough that the combined thing just wouldn&#x27;t work.",1398960031

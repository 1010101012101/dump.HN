Now that we walk upright, there&#x27;s a dead spot in the back of the cavity where mucus and bacteria can pool. This is why if you&#x27;re experiencing sinus pressure but you haven&#x27;t reached the stage where nothing in your head is moving if you tip your head forward you can often feel an immediate lessening of pressure.",1431611973

Airborne transmission, plus long linger times for surface transmission, plus long incubation periods, plus low survivability, times zero treatment options, times international airports, equals annihilated species.<p>This might connect with government secrets somehow if there were a secret project to develop a weaponized virus, and a vaccine for it, then to sneak the vaccine into a multivalent vaccine commonly given to the domestic population, but not to foreigners.  The revelation might startle another bio-capable nation into pre-emptively releasing <i>their</i> supervirus, relying on quarantines to save a portion of their population from the American weapon.<p>There are <i>practical</i> limits on the downside.  The worst we could probably do at our current tech level is kill everything on the Earth&#x27;s surface except for the extremophiles like D. radiodurans, and even that would assume that a lot of people have been telling a lot of lies about existing stockpiles of cobalt-salted nuclear weapons or other types of salted nukes.",1431611919

It is part of any healthy life and how we handle it, in those cases where we have time to handle it, will reflect who each of chooses to be.<p>Cheri spent more than 20 years as a hospice social worker helping people cope with quality of life by discussing death, and what I know I know mostly through osmosis as &quot;a hospice spouse.&quot; Hospice is usually better than the alternatives. Too many people in the US are discouraged from enrolling until the last ounce has been squeezed from their insurer. This means that palliative pain treatment is weighed against the textbook possibility of addiction and other long term effects as well as the risk of an audit for prescribing opiates.

With exceptions that prove the rule, like SF author Joe Haldeman, all professors are tenured or tenure track, they only get tenure by being #1 or #2 in their field (<i>very</i> occasionally #3, and this is strongly enforced in multiple ways), and that of course means they&#x27;re able to support themselves with grant money (plus one day a week to otherwise earn money).  <i>And</i> they must be <i>adequate</i> teachers, and I came across/knew of very few who weren&#x27;t serious and sincere about education, although of course their ability varied.<p>And this is enforced a whole bunch of ways post-tenure, e.g. I witnessed a case where a professor a lot of us have heard about was sat down by the head of his department (who I worked for at the time) and forced to read all the student evaluations of a course he&#x27;d just taught, which were all strongly negative except for another exception that proved the rule (we&#x27;d read them prior to the confrontation), and was then told he&#x27;d never teach that course again, he&#x27;d screwed up so badly.<p>Anyway, yeah, I can see all your points, which reinforce what I&#x27;ve been reading and occasionally witnessing starting in the &#x27;70s.  One might more broadly correlate it with caviler way colleges and universities let students take on massive debt with all too often little chance of repaying it in a reasonable amount of time, the massive bloat of administrators, and how the latter are wresting more control from the faculty ... too many of these institutions just aren&#x27;t all that serious about undergraduate education.",1431611883

9545016,comment,9543005,9544415,0,0,tel,,,"Closures are one implementation of functions. In a language which also has mutable variables, closures create a special kind of private variable behavior.<p>You&#x27;re used to thinking of functions which act on things passed into them via their parameters. For instance:<p><pre><code>    function apply(f, x) { return f(x); }
</code></pre>
My example, apply, is a bit unique in that it <i>only</i> uses things passed in through the parameters. More normally, you might also use names of things available in the scope when you define the function, for instance:<p><pre><code>    function log(x) { console.log(x); }
</code></pre>
In this example, the behavior of add depends not only on the parameter x but also the fact that console.log is defined ambiently.<p>What a closure refers to is the fact that functions can capture names which are only ever available locally thus hiding a reference inside of them. A simple example might be:<p><pre><code>    function makeExample() {
      var exampleText = &quot;Hello world&quot;;
      return function printer() {
        console.log(exampleText);
      }
    }

    var myPrinter = makeExample();
    printer();
    // Hello world
</code></pre>
In this case, the variable `exampleText` is clearly being captured in the definition of `printer`, but since `exampleText` is only defined in the scope of `makeExample`, we have no way of accessing it. The function stored at `myPrinter` has closed over its own copy of `exampleText` can uses it internally in a way we cannot access.<p>So finally we can turn to the more interesting examples where we combine this closure/capture property with mutability. The canonical example is the counter:<p><pre><code>    function makeCounter() {
      var count = 0;
      return {
        get: function get() { return count; },
        inc: function inc() { count += 1; },
        dec: function dec() { count -= 1; }
      }
    }

    var myCounter = makeCounter();
    var get = myCounter.get;
    var inc = myCounter.inc;
    var dec = myCounter.dec;

    assert(get() === 0);
    inc();
    assert(get() === 1);
    dec();
    assert(get() === 0);
</code></pre>
Here, `makeCounter` returns a struct of functions which have all independently captured a reference to the same hidden variable `count`. While I return them all together in an object, I also destructure that object to stress that there&#x27;s nothing funny going on—the three functions have to be created together to capture the same `count` variable, but afterward they can be separated far and wide.<p>Since all three functions reference the same hidden variable state they can manipulate it together. This is the magic of variable capture under mutable state: closures.<p>---<p>So what&#x27;s the point?<p>Well, we&#x27;ve essentially created a private mutable variable on a home-grown object system. There is no way for someone to access the secret `count` reference except via the get/inc/dec functions which have closed over it. This can be very valuable for data encapsulation.<p>To skip to the punch, Javascript only has a reasonable module system because of closures. If you&#x27;re familiar with the IIFE-based modules of Javascript they go a little like this<p><pre><code>    exports = {};

    (function(exports) {

      var count = 0;

      function inc() { count += 1 };
      function dec() { count -= 1 };

      // With only this function and not `get` exported we can never
      // actually view the value of count. This can be very useful
      // for implementation hiding and building a minimal API.
      function isEven() { return count % 2 == 0 };

      exports = { inc: inc, dec: dec, isEven: isEven };
  
    })(exports)
</code></pre>
Here we see that the IIFE creates a private, local scope where names like `count` can be created and closed over by exported functions like `inc`, `dec`, and `isEven`. This public/private API building is the core of module creation and, ultimately, it rests upon the creation of closures.",1431610090

9544951,comment,9543005,9544415,0,0,ajuc,,,"Closure is a function that &quot;remembers&quot; all variables that were in scope at the place where that function was created. It can then use these variables (as if they were global variables), even if they are outside of the scope when the function is invoked.<p>These variables also won&#x27;t get garbage collected because of that.<p>This feature is most useful when you create anonymous functions that you pass around.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>    function foo() {
       var localVariable = 3;
       return (function () { // this anonymous function can reference localVariable because it is a closure and remembers outside scope
           localVariable++; 
           alert(localVariable);
       })
    }

    var increase = foo(); //foo returns freshly created anonymous function that we assign to local variable &quot;increase&quot;.
   //foo also created local variable &quot;localVariable&quot;
   //and it went out of scope when foo returned,
   //but that variable won&#x27;t be GC-ed as long we keep reference to &quot;increase&quot;,
   //because increase has that &quot;localVariable&quot; in scope

    increase() // we call that variable - it executes that functions and writes 4
    
    function bar() {
       var localVariable = 100; //this is different variable with the same name
       increase(); //bar can reference increase because bar is a closure, so it remembers outside scope
    }
    
    bar(); // writes 5
    increase(); //writes 6

    var increase2 = foo(); // this creates another function and another localVariable

    increase2();  //writes 4
    increase(); //writes 7
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s useful for similar things as objects in OO programming (grouping data with code), but encourages different approach to this.<p>Closures also make functional code with passing functions bearable - without it you would have to explicitly pass variables from scope to each function, or to depend on dynamic scope, so your functions would use different variables depending where they are called.",1431609360

It could be real, but it could also be an increase in false positives.<p>A possible explanation for the false positives:<p>Many large companies are seeing more and more machines moving to IE11, but have websites/tools that require IE8.  Ideally each web site should explicitly declare compatibility/standard modes they require in their HTML.  But for older enterprise software, this is not an option, so companies take the &#x27;easy&#x27; approach of enabling compatibility mode for all sites and/or all intranet sites.  A better approach when you can&#x27;t edit the html of the web app is to use the group policy editor and set compatibility mode on a URL by URL basis.  But many companies take the easier route. This is my theory that may explain the false positives.<p>If they aren&#x27;t doing so, tools that aggregate browser usage should be doing additional analysis on the user agent string to get a better sense of the &#x27;true&#x27; IE version. Perhaps using methods like ie-truth [1].

I was just stating an article to further prove the point that not all schools are just a breeze and hand out As, and the higher grades are more likely attributed to having higher performing students, the trends of which become more obvious as competition for college acceptance goes up every year.<p>I think for my school people did choose the right majors but the Professors were hired based on their ability to bring in research/grant money and had no interest/some even acted disgusted at having to bother to teach a class, therefore alot of the class, despite being high performers in general, found that alot of classes, almost 100% consistent with the Professors mainly focused on research as opposed to teaching, caused lower grades overall. We have a very low endowment and overall much less money than MIT, so the pressure/incentive to hire Professors based on their ability to bring money in the school always trumps their ability to teach or produce a stimulating curriculum in general.<p>I would say this results in higher curves due to lower test performance in classes, that do not actually result in curving everyone up to an A, and thus is perceived by the outside world as &quot;tough grading&quot; but I think the students are of high caliber, but really it is a result of poor teaching. If the 64 students who have made it through the first two years of a college with high grades, all go into one class, and suddenly the average is 18/100 on an exam, and the 4.0 student makes a 55/100 and also gets an F without a curve, then we could say, maybe this is an issue with the a construct of incentivizing Professors to actually bother teaching and not so much that the students werent cut out for the major.<p>To add more stats, according to 2013, there were 16,000 undergraduate applicants to my school with an incoming freshman class of 1,204 so similar.<p>But on the more general point, I don&#x27;t think the main driver for the disparity between high grades in private schools is due to a scandal or grade inflation, as most of my points support, in general higher performing students get into higher performing schools and those more competitive schools are good, especially with a large applicant pool, at deciding who is capable of doing well there, though I would say MIT is much better at this than my school was.",1431608933

9544851,comment,9543889,9543889,0,0,mlent,,,"I can tell you the steps I used to learn German -- it took about 6-8 months until my only remaining hurtles were sheer vocabulary. Granted, I have a background in Ancient languages, so learning an inflected language like German (or Russian) is much easier for me than it would have been, already understanding gender and case and such. BUT, the methods I used to learn Classical languages did <i>not</i> work for German. I was not a believer in the &quot;practical methods&quot;, but they really do work if you do them right, in my opinion.<p>1. Started with Duolingo. I did not find it useful whatsoever.<p>2. Started reading Harry Potter in German. At first it took me like an hour to get through a page, I would just look at the English if a sentence was too complicated to figure out with the dictionary. I started to notice patterns, and would read grammar blogs and help sites for stuff that was reoccurring, (e.g. looking for &quot;relative pronouns&quot; on mydailygerman and german language stack exchange).  After making it through about 20 pages in HP, the improvement was dramatic. Reading is most important for thinking in a foreign word order. Now people tell me that I use some very sophisticated words and constructions, and it&#x27;s definitely because I learned German from reading. I&#x27;ve read three books in german now, and can read HP-level stuff without a dictionary.<p>Btw, I got a kindle for this purpose, but I think that part of the slowness of having to type the word out yourself in an online dictionary helps with memorization. Also, translations are never 1:1, so often the kindle dictionaries are not very helpful. I would go to the park and use my phone to look up words.<p>Also -- translated books are way easier to read than books originally written in a foreign language. Natively written stuff has too many idioms or strange constructions for a beginner. So reading translations of books you already know is much, much easier (you can also follow the story and not miss an important detail because you don&#x27;t understand a sentence and have to skip it).<p>3. Did Memrise for vocab, 1000 Elementary German words. This is huge for speaking confidence (and therefore, speed) -- that you <i>know</i> the gender of the word you are using. They also have sets that teach you which cases and prepositions verbs take, etc. (e.g. In german, you say &quot;I am proud ON you <you in the accusative>&quot;. These are hard to learn from just reading) The important thing is to say it out loud, just like the example. Eventually, you&#x27;ll just use the right gender without even thinking about it! (Something I thought was impossible)<p>4. Watched all the Harry Potter moves dubbed in German, with German subtitles. Twice. First time, I paused when I didn&#x27;t know a word, and used google translate to translate the sentence. So it would take me like 5+ hours per movie. But, this was one of the most dramatic things that helped my listening comprehension. In the two week period where I did nothing but vocab and watched these movies, I would say my german understanding at least doubled. I also re-watched the movies without subtitles (understanding much less), because it forces comprehension speed and really listening. But the subs are important at first so you know how to spell things ;)<p>Now I watch movies in German, and always have German subtitles on if the channel has them. If there is Russian Netflix, you can use a VPN and watch your favorite movies subbed/dubbed. You just really have to get high-quality productions, or the subs are too different to be helpful. The news is good non-subbed because they enunciate very clearly. Nature documentaries are also great, because they speak slowly and clearly. Never be afraid to pause/repeat/look up a word!<p>5. Writing. If you can get someone to write to, it&#x27;s great, because you have time to carefully express stuff you would want to say every day. So you effectively learn to write phrases that you will later want to say in conversation, but you have the time to research some more about how to do it correctly (and get in good habits).<p>6. Obviously, speaking. Though I have relatively little speaking experience (my job is in English), I am very capable of expressing myself. If you don&#x27;t have a native speaker to talk to every day, it also works to talk to yourself and try thinking in the language! Better if you live alone, so only you know that you&#x27;re crazy :)<p>So, in a summary: Watch movies and read books. If you see a pattern, research it. Look it up again and again until you memorize it (by seeing it in context). Tools like memrise are great for stuff that is hard to get from movies/reading, like genders. And of course, you need to find someone to talk to! Above all, realize that you will never know what is going on with 100% confidence :D<p>To give you some realistic expectations: I&#x27;ve lived in Germany since Jul. 2013. It took me 6 months to be conversational, and 8 months to read HP/only really need to improve vocabulary/expressions/comprehension speed. Interacting with German every day cannot be understated as a motivating factor -- you should visit Russia :)",1431608518

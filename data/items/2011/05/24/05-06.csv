And your markings visible to all users of service (unregistered even).<p>Social highlighting, meta-wiki over Internet.<p>My fears:\n- there were many highlighting services before (shiftspace, webnotes.net) and only Diigo is alive now. BUT: all of them is person centered, when goal of my service is to allow users to speed read the web (and help other users to do it)\n- service will be unpopular because people don't like to install extensions, user.js, etc. I don't know any top service, based on extensions.\n- people don't need it because most of them prefer to watch and listen instead of read.\n- there aren't easy monetization way of such service.<p>What do you think about vitality of such service?",1306216720

2578848,comment,2577700,2578705,1,0,Jach,,,"Unfortunately while this may work for design, it doesn't go the other way with programming, and so I then cast doubt on it working for design. I've never had opening problems with doors, so obviously I wouldn't think about designing them differently. I highly doubt I'd be the guy to think ""Hey, we should put a 'push' or 'pull' sign on this door!"" Several weeks ago someone posted on HN the fact that on some cars, the windshield wipers speed up automatically as the car speeds up, and vice versa, and concluded that the people who originally designed the wipers had never driven in the rain before. I've driven in the rain many times, and such an automation never occurred to me. My mind is elsewhere.<p>As others mentioned, maybe if programmers <i>wanted</i> to, they could put in the 10k hours and be designers. The tricky word there is <i>want</i>, and it's not very easy to change core desires. And wanting isn't always enough, some people can put in the 10k hours and still suck. Some people can immerse their minds in a subject and still suck. To me, all-equal ability is as mythical as natural born ability.",1306216575

2578834,comment,2576724,2578268,2,0,rcthompson,,,"It doesn't necessarily take a complex organism to fight disease. Pretty much every organism, including unicellular ones such as bacteria, possesses some form of innate immunity against that organism's most common pathogens. Simpler organisms fight disease by simply reproducing faster than the disease can kill them.<p>As for the brain having some sort of monopoly on ""organizing intelligent bahavior"", that is a complex issue. I wouldn't say that the adaptive immune system necessarily possesses intelligence. It consists of many small and relatively simple components that interact to produce complex behavior. Realize that during somatic hypermutation, the immune system is not intelligently <i>choosing</i> which mutations to generate. It simply generates a random sample of all possible mutations and then sets up a simple selection process that produces a result that looks intelligent to us.<p>On the other hand, one could plausibly make a similar argument about the brain's intelligence being the product of the interaction of individual neurons. Many people believe that our brains are no less deterministic than a silicon-based computer. Complexity is complex.<p>Anyway, to give you another example, cancer cells are subject to greatly increased mutation rates, and mutations that result in faster growth or better recruitment of nutrient-supplying blood vessels (vascularization) will quickly become fixed in the tumor as the cells with that mutation overtake the growth of others. This also provides an example where selection at the cellular level is at conflict with selection at the organismal level. Within the tumor, selection favors faster-growing cancer cells, but these same cells are clearly the most detrimental to the organism as a whole.",1306216029

We had two developers and two designers/strategists, and only one person with previous hackathon experience. The idea came from an offhand comment when we got stuck on another silly idea. After hashing it out, we realized that we all had the same goal in mind and started to build.<p>It was easy to split up the work because our skill sets were so different. We weren't stepping on each other's feet, and because of the time constraints, we didn't have time to second-guess anything. We used Dropbox and Github to manage our files, and frequently pushed updates to each other.<p>Dmitri wrote the server and scraped the CrunchBase. I wrote all the Javascript, except for the backend API calls and some setup logic. Adrian and Chris created all of the game mechanics and graphics, our main website, and some sounds that we never ended up using.<p>We did have some tense moments where Dmitri and I were both editing the Javascript and had conflicts, so we decided to both work on the same screen to stay sane.

Those static types and non-virtual functions means that yes, I can see every place that this particular function is called in our entire code base without having to dig all that much.

J is also very regular, so once one knows the basic vocabulary the programmer is able to infer the meanings of more complicated operators.

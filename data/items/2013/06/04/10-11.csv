5818663,comment,5814990,5818013,1,0,lsc,,,">Even assuming that Google is trying to become Facebook and that everyone is ""trying to get acquired"", why do those situations preclude trying to create something that you believe has actual value[?]<p>well, assuming you honestly believe that facebook creates enough real value to justify it's valuation, sure, you are right.   My take on the matter is that it's myspace 2.0.  I mean, no question, it's worth something, but not nearly what it's valued at right now.   I personally have a very difficult time believing that anyone who was working in the industry during the first dot-com can honestly believe that facebook is a sustainable business.<p>The only people I know who honestly espouse the view that facebook is fairly valued are facebook employees.  (Interestingly, I know no facebook employees who were working during the first dot com.)<p>I mean, maybe these people all really believe exactly what their paymasters want them to believe?   Personally, I find that thought far more creepy than the idea that they are just faking it because that's what the employer requires.   Certainly there is some selection effect;  you are more likely to apply for a facebook job if you believe the company is going somewhere?  but it's weird.  I remember one guy who is probably the staunchest facebook advocate I know now, he was extremely cynical about facebook before he got the job.  Of course, he's also pretty young, too young to have worked through the first dot-com.<p>The weird thing is that I know a bunch of people who work for defense contractors, too... a place where you'd expect a certain level of brainwashing.  None of those people believe their companies are doing good things for the world.   Not one.   I mean, they generally think the work is really interesting, but they don't believe at all in the end goals.  (and I do have some conservative friends... it's just that none of them work for defense contractors.)<p>But then, what do I know?   I find that what I consider to be 'spammy crap'  is a pretty good heuristic for what most people want.  I don't use facebook because it consists almost entirely of what I would call spammy crap.  Spammy crap and baby pictures.",1370343520

Germany and Japan didn't play much of a role in this picture any more.<p>So what the US got from the use of nuclear weapons was much more than just the japanese surrender. It was a stronger position compared to the Sowjets and the garantee that the war in europe didn't continue on after the German surrender. In order to prevent this, the western allies even slowed their advance to Berlin to allow the Sowjets their successes. Which doesn't mean they didn't have their fair share of it anyway.<p>But that is just my point of view and I'm no historian.<p>And finally to the point about saving lives. I've grown tired of nationalistic people stating an unverifiable estimate of probale deaths as the herois reason to kill any number people right know. You don't save people by killing others and it is certainly not heroic. I know that the victors writes the history, but this argument mostly comes up in cases where some really bad things have to reinterpreted.",1370343069

5818608,comment,5817577,5818314,3,0,tomelders,,,"Perhaps every patent suit should trigger an automatic re-assesment of the patent in question. Right now, it seems the biggest weapon in a patent trolls arsenal is the ber-general patent; patents so vague that they can literally apply to anything in the past, present and future. Triggering a re-evaluation of a patent every time it is used in litigation would, I think, serve as a huge deterrent.<p>With regard to companies like ARM, who's patents are of a very high quality and technically innovative and detailed, it would be hard for people to argue that they don't deserve the patent. But people who have essentially patented the internet without providing any worthwhile details would find it a lot more difficult to retain their patent once other interested parties are given the opportunity to call it out as bullshit.<p>I do think it is a little unfair to ask the patent offices to make the right call every time with regard to patent filings, simply because of the sheer volume they have to process. Giving them a second chance to evaluate a patent with the input of experts in the field that a particular patent relates to would be beneficial to everyone.<p>Going to an extreme: Maybe you could grant any and all patent filings automatically, and only the patents used in patent suits are evaluated.

I do not know how familiar you are with some European countries' social system, but young parents are usually given quite a few months of vacation time and salary from the state, a sort of children allowance until a child is 18 years old (100EUR or so), tax deductions for every child until a child is 18 years old, kindergarten 'bonuses', free health care for every child and similar.<p>So this definitely deserves a lot of attention as it makes young parents' lives quite easier.

However the text actually uses mathematical notation throughout, and as far as I could tell it is often not explained.

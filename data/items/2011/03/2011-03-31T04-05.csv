2390451,comment,2390298,2390298,1,0,101north,,,"That's awesome that you've come across an idea that excites you. However, I'd advise against leaving college. Before I get into why, I just wanted to mention that I totally know where you're coming from, as I graduated from college relatively recently with a degree that has very little to do with tech, and I definitely related to that feeling of disenchantment<p>1. Regardless of whether or not your startup works out, it's likely that you'll apply to/work for someone else's company one day (even if it's briefly). While there is this growing notion that one doesn't need a college degree to qualify for a position, it's not widely adopted yet and I wouldn't count on it being widely adopted in the near future. With that said, taking a leave from college and going back a  year later would be an absolute bummer. If you're disenchanted now, you'd be 10X as much once you're back there, because all your peers will have graduated.<p>2. Even if what you're learning doesn't interest you, the experience of college is an education in of itself - in both discipline and the social world.<p>Regarding discipline, we can work all we want at our startups, but if we really need to take a day off then we probably can. There's no one to answer to other than ourselves. If there's a midterm on Monday, and the world is crashing down the week before, you're still going to have to take that midterm. Even if you're not into what you're learning, forcing yourself to do work you don't want to is important, and is a skill that will be necessary no matter what company you start.<p>Regarding the social world, the college experience is pretty key in helping you find yourself and shape yourself as a person. Right now you're a part of a journey, but if you came back a couple years later it will definitely feel different.<p>3. As another commenter mentioned, start the idea while you're in college without taking a leave. Ideas are merely hypotheses. Wait until your hypothesis is validated through user adoption/etc. before you consider leaving school.<p>4. Worst comes to worst, if you don't get to execute the idea because of college, just trust that you're going to have another killer idea. I'm sure you're intelligent and you're clearly ambitious. Ideas might have life-spans but your creativity won't.<p>5. Standing up on graduation day after pulling through 4 years straight is an incredible feeling, and I'm sure I speak for many of us when I say that it's a day where you're just really proud of yourself for pulling through. Unless you have a totally horrendous experience, it'll feel worth it on graduation day.<p>With that said, I wish I majored in CS in college and sat in on more psychology lectures :)",1301547193

2390428,comment,2389653,2389903,4,0,morrow,,,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading that -- spot on.  Just for kicks, here's my more optimistic vision for the future:<p>1) HP/WebOS focuses it's marketing message on using ""open"" tech (HTML, CSS, JS).  Some iOS/android developers convert apps, some web devs convert websites, most don't bother.<p>2) People pick these up as they are in stock and get to the sites people need with flash as a big selling point as well (news, mail, youtube, hulu, entertainment, etc).<p>3) Google releases a ChromeOS Tablet, using point 2 above to their advantage by claiming compatibility with all internet sites (even flash!).  They sell quickly and cheaply, as google takes a loss on each tablet in hope of gaining market share and increasing google search usage (it's the default home-page on this device).<p>4) More hardware / software manufacturers follow Google's lead, and momentum shifts towards using tablets mainly as dumb web-clients (with offline storage, better graphics, and other ""native"" features provided by HTML5 APIs).<p>5) Apple raises the bar by releasing an extremely-polished-at-this-point itunes.com and a super-cheap ""air/cloud"" tablet (similar to chromeOS's offer), allowing you to buy and sell ""cloud"" apps (HTML CSS JS) with existing app store rules and credit cards on itunes.com or in the ""cloud"" app store.  Buy once, use on all your iOS and Mac devices (includes apps,  music, video).<p>6) Tablets aren't bought and sold based on whether angry birds runs on them (its a web-app and runs everywhere), but instead on hardware features and performance (battery-life, screen size/resolution, heat, weight, etc.).  Forced to compete on these grounds, hardware manufacturers invent better batteries, hybrid color e-ink/lcd screens that can be used in the sun, better speakers, and maybe even something crazy like user-replaceable batteries, RAM, and hard disks.<p>One can dream, anyway...",1301546093

Amtrak's TOS require the user to recognize that Amtrak's proprietary right in the data on its website is valid and enforceable probably because the law does not recognize that right by default.  I think it is written that way to allow Amtrak's attorneys to make some creative arguments in court if it would need to sue.

Being a part time student allows you to still access most of the university resources. Many of these can be very valuable.<p>2) Don't drop out <i>to</i> work on your project. Start planning what you're doing, begin to work on it, show it to people, and then drop out once it looks promising.<p>It's tempting to drop out right away, but if you have no plan, no skills, and no money, it's a recipe for disaster.  It's also expensive; paying the rent and food is no fun and occupies my mind too often.",1301544473

More to the point, RodericDay apparently didn&#x27;t have any either.<p>If I say Apple knows a few things about global supply chain management, and thus it might be a good idea not to criticise them as clowns who couldn&#x27;t run a lemonade stand, it does not follow that I disagree with all criticism of every business everywhere just because my arguments could, in theory, have been made about other companies.  Because that particular argument would be <i>wrong</i> applied to almost any other company.<p>> Also, &quot;Communist&quot; China has raised quite a lot of people out of povert as well.<p>That was the precise process I was referring to, and as I&quot;m sure you&#x27;re aware (hence your scare quotes), it was via the operations of modern global capitalism, very similar to what is even now beginning to take place in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the Asian periphery.<p>> I can&#x27;t accept the notion that one has to have a thoughout solution to a complex problem to be able to express ones views.<p>To be sure.

6551753,comment,6551092,6551092,6,0,tempestn,,,"There is obviously a market for a phone with minimal choice, and it&#x27;s filled nicely by Apple.  I tend to agree that Android can be overwhelming, especially to new users, given the overwhelming number of choices, both critical and trivial.<p>In my opinion though, the solution is not less choice, but better and stronger defaults.  There&#x27;s no reason why android phones couldn&#x27;t be as simple as iphones out of the box, but have more options for configuration for users who wish to dig deeper.  Instead, at the moment we generally have phones full of bloatware, where many of the defaults seem designed to sell products and services of questionable value, rather than to aid the user.<p>The example of default application bindings in the article is a good one.  That system is indeed terrible currently, but there&#x27;s no reason it needs to be.  At a minimum it should be possible to edit the bindings of any installed application, rather than simply clearing them all.  (Right now it almost seems like the designers were trying to follow this philosophy of minimizing choice, but ended up with a hybrid that is both more overwhelming and less customizable than it could be.)  There is also no reason why users necessarily have to be interrupted by the choice of app to perform a given action.  Instead, an app could be chosen based on some predefined hierarchy, such as first installed.  Then let the user <i>override</i> that choice if desired.  (For example, by pressing the menu button within X seconds of one app launching another, then choosing the appropriate option.)  You get the same benefit without overwhelming less knowledgeable users with choice.  (And yes, some users might never realize that there was a choice at all, but that&#x27;s a fair sight better than there indeed <i>not</i> being one.)",1381817446

That is about as much entropy as in four randomly-generated lowercase-letter-or-digit characters (log2(36^4) = 20.7): a great improvement for bad passwords, but modest for good passwords.  The authors are hoping that its easiness-to-remember per bit of entropy is significantly greater than that of passwords (randomly generated and human chosen passwords).<p>[1] Once the attacker has gained all server data, there&#x27;s no stopping brute-forcing.  Even with SRP ( <a href=""http://srp.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://srp.stanford.edu/</a> ) in which the server <i>never</i> sees the plaintext password, if the attacker gains a password&#x27;s verifier that&#x27;s stored on the server then they can offline-brute-force it.

Because we constantly fight with phishers, before we switched to CloudFlare, we would get hit by massive DDos attacks at least once a year, and that would result in downtime and in getting kicked out of a dedicated server provider or being asked high fees to put us on on a dedicated network. After moving to CloudFlare, we are not even aware of it if we get hit by a DDos.<p>We are very thankful to CloudFlare! Happy birthday!",1411829979

This test didn&#x27;t stress that as aggressively as it could have.

The fact that there are any reports at all within the first few <i>days</i> of the phone being available is troubling. What matters is the overall rate of bending under &quot;normal&quot; phone handling conditions. Even if that rate is fairly low (say one per million per day) that still results in a huge number of people with bent phones over their expected use lifetime (nearly 1 in 1000 over the standard 2 year upgrade window).<p>Moreover, the rate of things like phone bending is probably non-linear, because it will happen during the highest amount of applied bending force over the period of use, which probably doesn&#x27;t happen every day. If the iPhone 6 plus is just enough weaker than other phones such that it bends more commonly under fairly common handling conditions for any phone then the result could be a LOT of bent phones.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several videos of people bending these phones and to be honest it looks like Apple has a problem. The phone seems to be much weaker than any device designed for that use environment should be.<p>Considering that Jobs went to great efforts to ensure that the original iPhone was rugged under normal but inadvised handling conditions (i.e. putting it in the same pocket as keys, thus the use of gorrila glass), I can&#x27;t help but see this bendiness as a decided step backwards in the design philosophy of the iPhone line.",1411828691

8377062,comment,8376658,8376658,1,0,csandreasen,,,"I think the big issue here isn&#x27;t that Apple is now encrypting iPhones.  In general, being able to secure the data on your phone is a huge benefit for the average consumer.  People lose their phones all of the time, and you have no idea who is going to find your lost phone and what they&#x27;re going to do with the data on it.  Given the amount of sensitive data people throw on their phones without thinking, Apple is probably doing more to prevent petty crime and identify theft by encrypting the data on iPhones.<p>The big issue as I see it, though, is that Apple isn&#x27;t advertising this as a means of protecting yourself from criminals.  Instead, they advertised it as a means of preventing Apple from complying with warrants.  Warrants constitute an violation of a person&#x27;s privacy which is explicitly allowed in the constitution.  There&#x27;s a good reason we have them, and a process that&#x27;s been in place for a few centuries to limit their abuse.  More often than not, the bad guy is not the federal government, and the public is served by allowing the police to investigate specific individuals under reasonable suspicion with specific limitations as authorized by the courts.  If people have a problem with the way warrants are issued or how the police carry out investigations, they should seek to change that process, not try to circumvent them.<p>This isn&#x27;t going to keep out the NSA.  It only affects that data physically residing on your phone, and when was the last time the NSA had your phone physically in its possession?  This likely isn&#x27;t going to stop actual law enforcement officials from getting access to the data on your phone.  Unless you&#x27;re typing in a strong password every time you pull your phone out of your pocket, the FBI will likely be able to brute force your phone to gather evidence with little difficulty, providing the courts allow them to do so.  On that front, the only thing this has really accomplished is allowing Apple to give the middle finger to the feds in an attempt to appease a customer base who thinks the government is out to get them.",1411827261

That is, it&#x27;s worth it to pay more in order to not have to worry about whether you&#x27;ll have enough food when you want it.<p>Right now the only way to make sure you have enough is to buy more than you need by a safety margin.  But what if there was some way to easily procure/prepare the food on an as-needed basis?<p>I&#x27;ve seen ideas about having a 3d printer, where large stocks of food could be kept and combined as needed into a variety of recipes.  The inputs would be stored dry, so they won&#x27;t go bad as quickly.<p>This might work, but there are downsides as well.  Specifically, you might have problems getting the food to taste good enough to be a viable alternative.  From the link, the top types of food wasted are fruit and veg, seafood, grains, meat, and milk.  A powdered version of grains might work, but you&#x27;d probably have difficult getting all other types to be tasty/healthy enough.  I mean, there&#x27;s a reason why everyone isn&#x27;t eating canned food all the time.<p>Another idea is to improve the just-in-time logistics, like the drone burrito delivery.  Aside from the regulatory hurdles, I think this would work pretty well - pay more in order to not have to worry about whether you&#x27;ll have enough food when you want it.  There might also be a B2B angle to this with restaurants or grocery stores.  Amazon has done some work on this with AmazonFresh, where they do same-day delivery of perishables.<p>The other thing to realize is that the actual farming is apparently only 16-18% of the price paid for the food, so you&#x27;d hope to get efficiencies elsewhere.",1411826442

In other words, partition the evaluations into sets based on the students&#x27; performance. Then you&#x27;d end up with a spectrum of instructor ratings, from F to A, not an average.<p>If the institution wants to make a choice of instructors for an introductory course, they might want to select the instructor with the higher low-grade rating. The intuition here is that well-performing students in an introductory course might have prior knowledge, so their ratings add noise.<p>If the institution wants to compare two instructors overall, they can compare their spectra after subtracting the skew that results from low-performers evaluating poorly and high-performers evaluating highly. What remains is some picture of how the instructor handles students of different strengths and weaknesses, which (I think) is the best measure of a teacher.",1411826420

Selection would involve holding the left mouse button down on the user name for more than 1.5 seconds, and then the popup would appear with bio, member since, and karma.

If there is someone who is truly harassing employees, it behooves the company to get rid of them as quickly as possible because people like that are a tremendous liability.""<p>You would think, but reality is sometimes different.  The problem is that these things are often he said/she said, and HR does not want to do anything that creates the appearance that one-side is telling the truth, because this opens them up.  Or if there was negligence in the past, this makes them vulnerable to federal law.  Or if they have a pending lawsuit.

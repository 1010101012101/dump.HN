I don't think I did.  Please point this out in the thread.  My <i>actual</i> position is that DRM and SaaS are two different things, because the former restricts what you can do on machines <i>that you possess</i>.  You reply by pointing out that you can simply choose not to participate.  However, my fear is that DRM on home computers and laptops will become as widespread as DRM in DVD players.  And yes, this battle should be fought in the marketplace.  This seems to be working so far, somewhat. Or is it?<p>That's an interesting point.  If I wanted to buy a <i>new</i> laptop or desktop completely free of DRM, how easy or hard is it for me to do so?  Well, leave out any machines that come with Windows or OS X installed.  Those contain DRM.  Leave out machines with HDMI -- this also contains DRM.  I think I'd have to build my own machine or custom order one.<p>I think we're in danger of becoming a world where non-DRM hardware is hard to attain.  There is far less danger of restrictive SaaS.  If we don't like one provider, we simply move to a different one.  The market for SaaS is still a bit more ""free.""",1262450536

Paine violently disagreed.<p>When you have a complex system, he said, there's nobody to blame any more. If a King masses troops, invades your houses, or taxes you onerously you know whom to blame. If a deomcratic legislature votes to fund a war, conscript your children, or change how people vote, you know whom to blame.<p>But if, as in this incident, an elected legislature sets up a complex, mostly autonomous mangle of agencies managing an also complex underlying system and something goes wrong?

Exported/sold to almost every country.<p>For basic consumer goods, the majority of the time you just have to declare the export/customs paperwork properly, and make it clear that any VAT, import duties, taxes, etc. are the responsibility of the buyer.  Just be sure to fill out the paperwork accurately (people will often ask you to under-value items, declare them as a samples, warranty replacements, and so on).<p>You'll likely want to incorporate an official business entity in your state.  Specifics about taxes and regulations vary by state, but generally speaking you can run something like this out of your garage/basement until it gets large enough to warrant consideration of a more formal location.<p>My best advice is probably to find a decent local attorney and have him/her help you with all the initial incorporation paperwork.  This shouldn't cost more than a couple of hundred dollars.  You will also likely have other legal questions from time to time with this kind of operation, and it's helpful to have a relationship with someone who can give you good legal guidance and help you deal with any regulatory issues and so on.<p>For shipping, get a UPS account.  They have a nice API and you can get real-time shipping quotes easily.  Tack on $5-$10 for each order to cover packaging costs.<p>Stocking inventory depends on anticipated volumes.  I started by placing small orders for items, and when adding new products would do some hyping and offer ""pre-ordering"" to get a feel for demand before stocking up.  You will learn to get the feel of it, and because there are 1,000,000 different niches, I can't suggest anything more detailed.  Also, if you can get products locally, even at much higher prices, it can be helpful to first source locally, even if you don't make much profit, to get a feel for demand, and then order direct.",1262448140

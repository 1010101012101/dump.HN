5459434,comment,5450542,5458816,2,0,Jach,,,"I thought I'd pop in and mention this set of lectures (now a book, huh) from Scott Aaronson on quantum mechanics and quantum computing: <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/</a> Particularly Lecture 9 goes into the basic mathematics of quantum mechanics, and explains why it's more appropriate to consider it an extension to probability theory using complex numbers and call them amplitudes, rather than classic probabilities. Not being a physicist myself I don't know if this is really helpful in clearing up professional scientists' intuitions, but it's helpful for me at least in grasping the basics.<p>You're on the right track by noting that quantum theorists can use probability to communicate their findings. A single classical probability like 0.7 is a <i>summary</i>, not the whole picture. For the whole picture, you need a log of observations with time stamps, which is a tremendous amount of data because taken to the extreme it's a balancing act between maximizing the data you know about you and your surroundings and minimizing the number of planck unit time steps to collect the data. Even with more realistic amounts of data it's still a lot to pack around, so you can summarize it by constructing a probability distribution which is more convenient mathematically, and you can summarize that probability distribution into a handful of numbers if you need to because those are even easier to pack around. (Like the single probability 0.7, or two numbers u and s that characterize a Normal distribution, etc.)<p>So if you think of probability as just summarizing your past observations and constraining your expectations for future observations (because what else can?), I think it's easy to see how two people can have different probabilities that represent a belief in a proposition or an abstract system or something else. If both are being honest (I'm packing a lot of assumptions in that word since this is basically Aumann's agreement theorem) and the probabilities are different, there are a couple reasons why: either at least one of them has information (observations) the other one does not, or they started out with different prior probabilities. In the former case, they can reach agreement by sharing data. In the latter case, they can eventually reach agreement by obtaining more data or choosing a common prior. With enough successive Bayesian updates, you can arrive at the same conclusion regardless of where you started. (In practice, of course, things are more hairy and not this simplistic, which is what the submitted pdf is addressing in part.)<p>I find it hard to grok what it means for something to have a physical frequency property. I can understand it as a statistic of an abstract system, i.e. a probability, but in light of Many Worlds, I don't think a frequency can fundamentally be a property of something in the same way energy can be. But since the energy of a photon is related to the photon's ""frequency"" via its ""wavelength"", is energy really fundamental or is the relation just a convenient means of making the wave mechanics useful? I've read Feynman tell how the whole idea of forces is just a somewhat circular simplification that's not really fundamental, even though sometimes it seems like it is. While I have a high degree of certainty about the physics accurately describing reality as she is, my meta-belief / confidence about that high certainty isn't nearly as high simply because I feel a lot of confusion about the ultimate nature of reality. But at least at a higher level than fundamental physics, it's clear to me that saying a ""fair coin"" has p=0.5 per unique side is really just summarizing we don't have enough knowledge of the flipper and the environment it is flipped in to predict the result with certainty in the way we can predict the result of the output of a logic OR gate with low- and high- voltage inputs with certainty. This is different than the uncertainty of which branch you are within a Many Worlds universe, where it's more of a physical resolution problem rather than one of needing more knowledge, similar to not being able to find out what happens between planck unit time steps (if anything happens and if the question means anything).<p>Ben Goertzel's book Probabilistic Logic Networks is another resource I'd recommend. Sorry if my branching reply is a bit big, but I'm constantly trying to clarify things for myself as well. ;)",1364536005

IQ is literally just ""the (population-normalized) number that comes out of IQ tests"", and IQ tests are structured as a set of pattern-matching/lateral-thinking questions which must be answered under time-constraint.<p>Everyone can recognize a pattern or get a lateral thinking puzzle <i>eventually</i>. Adding the time-constraint splits the world into people who can recognize patterns <i>quickly enough to employ that pattern-recognition in the course of their every-day life</i>, and those who can't: thus, IQ. Without the time constraint, an IQ test wouldn't really measure anything at all.<p>IQ is believed to relate to <i>intelligence</i> because the ability to see patterns sufficiently quickly gives you a kind of ""intuition"" for new subjects. It's like a lubrication against friction: without it, new subjects will be ""at rest"" in your mind, and you'll have to give them a push to get your understanding of them going. With it, they'll just slide down the funnel right into your brain. :)<p>More technically, IQ could be seen as a measure for how much of a cost your brain puts to engaging your type-2 reasoning (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_eleph...</a>). As expected, glucose, butter, CNS stimulants, and other things that make the brain think it has more ""stored resource"" to work with, are measured to enhance IQ--because they lower the brain's calculation of this cost, and therefore allow you to engage your lateral-thinking processes more easily and more often. Likewise, hunger, depression, and other things which raise your brain's cost evaluations unilaterally, also raise the cost of engaging your type-2 reasoning, and thus lower your IQ.",1364535186

5459399,comment,5459216,5459216,24,0,Shenglong,,,"Background and summary (forgive me if some details need correcting):<p>Cyprus is a tiny country with a GDP not much higher than Tim Hortons. Yet, it had something like 150 billion in private funds stored in two of its banks: the Bank of Cyprus and Lakie. Why? Because the majority of the funds (I am generalizing) belongs/belonged to Russians who took advantage of the people on the conversion out of communism (dirty money). As North Americans have Swiss bank accounts, the Russians have Cyprus. Obviously, other people have their money in here too.<p>Greek's insolvency impacted Cyprus greatly, because a large portion of the Cyprus population are of Greek descent. Thus, when the banks were figuring out where to invest, a large portion of the funds went to Greece. As a result, the banks lost a ton of money, and are on the verge of making the country insolvent. The IMF said the government needed to come up with a large amount of money.<p>At first they tried to pass a bill that would skim 10% off all Cyprus bank accounts that had over 10k Euros. There was unimaginable outrage, because as you can guess, that affects a good portion of the population. In response, they changed the bill to only affect those with over 100k Euros. Interestingly, this time, mostly the Russian dirty money was affected, and there was not as much public outrage (stealing stolen money). As a result, now 30% of all bank accounts over 100k Euros are being seized.<p>All the North Americans probably don't realize why this is such a big deal. In North America, we have money in companies, hedge funds, etc. In Europe, from what I've been told, banks are the major (almost exclusive) depository. Thus, you can imagine that this is a much bigger deal.",1364534969

Bleh.<p>The fact of the matter is that the Eurozone is a bad idea, a lot of economists said it was a bad idea, and now they're seeing their predictions come true. For each European financial disaster it's easy to blame some convenient cause, but eventually you have to ask: what is it about the Eurozone that is so good at precipitating financial crises? As banks collapsed and massive financial contagion in America was uncovered, did anyone in 2007-08 (besides a small number of monetary-inclined economists) think the very Euro would be threatened again, and again, and again, as America lurched along in limp but definite recovery?<p>To paraphrase Bill Clinton: it's the money, stupid. The Eurozone is structured to suck the money out of peripheral economies in times of crisis, which then seize up like an engine starved of oil. The best banking system in the world cannot survive if all its money disappears. Cyprus does not have the best banking system in the world, so I guess they're worse off.",1364534054

Some kids, coming out of high school, will know calculus, or have the ability to play an instrument, or the ability to render the human form in an anatomically-correct fashion. They also might know any amount of <i>trivia</i>--a list of presidents, the names of all the bones in the human body, etc.<p>None of that knowledge is really representative of being any ""better"" at anything. They may have just spent less time on the basics, and more time on the advanced stuff. It might just mean they were pushed to take more credits by their parents. They will likely have fundamental gaps (the inability to multiply two numbers in their head, for example) and rely on crutches (like a calculator) to keep up with everyone else in the advanced classes they're forced to sprint through. They might have done it all through rote memorization, and have no clear idea of what any of it <i>means</i>. Recall the refrain of most medical students: ""I don't have time for the lesson; just give me the formula.""<p>This is in opposition to the people who <i>are</i> ""just better"" at the fundamentals: each new thing they set out to learn, they'll learn faster and better, because they'll be building their new knowledge on top of <i>mastery</i> rather than a shaky 60%-and-move-on foundation.<p>You might wonder about IQ: IQ or ""g"" is literally the measure of how fast you can recognize and employ new patterns, and therefore how fast you'll master new micro-skills. Kids with higher IQs will do better under time-constraint. But given as much time as needed, and assuming mastery of previous subjects, IQ is irrelevant.<p>An amusing visual analogy: when you master a micro-skill, you've cleanly filled up a line of blocks in the ""well"" of your knowledge. When you master enough micro-skills, leaving no ""gaps"", the knowledge comes together and compresses: you get a Tetris. :)",1364533614

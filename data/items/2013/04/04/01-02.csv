5490476,comment,5487511,5490367,0,0,crgt,,,"jlgreco noted above that karma has not been measured, and implied that this meant that it didn't exist. The tarantula example was intended as a response to that claim.<p>Regarding your supposed coincidence - how does predicting karma differ from predicting the Higgs?  Until recently, the Higgs previously had never been directly measured, and now it seems that it has been.  It's a coincidence that they found what they were looking for?  That stretches credulity. I wonder why the prediction of karma would be any different than any of the predictions made by Western science.<p>As for why I believe karma is more plausible than unicorns, well, to answer that question I do think it is important to be clear what we mean by karma, in order to get at what I find plausible.  There are many different specific definitions for karma with more nuance than we likely want to dig into here, but the core idea, as I said above, is the idea of cause and effect.  Perhaps the biggest difference between the karmic notion of cause and effect and our Western ideas of cause and effect is the idea that our intentions matter in determining the consequences of our actions.  Why does this seem plausible to me?  Well, it has been my experience that intentions do matter, and can often result in real world effects.  How specifically does this happen?  I'm not sure.  But magnetism worked before we understood why. As did gravity. So it's plausible to me that karma (insofar as it is understood as the intentions of our actions having real consequences) could operate before we understand (or can measure) why.   Is this certain?  As I've said, no.  But it certainly seems plausible that intent matters.<p>On the other hand, if by karma you mean the idea that our actions and intentions will result in a specific kind of rebirth, well, that's perhaps less plausible to me than the more generalized notion.  But I'm certainly not willing to declare it Not The Case.",1365040101

Herokus architecture is bad as well. It's the combination of these that causes the problem. But that does not mean that it's impossible, or even hard, to solve the problem at Herokus end.<p>> I'm not sure there are such providers, and if there aren't, I think it's safe to point the finger towards Rails.<p>This is not sound logic. I described above two methods for solving the problem: (1) increase the memory per Dyno (see below: they're doing this, going from 512MB to 1GB per Dyno IIRC, which although still low will be a great improvement if that means that your app can now run 2 concurrent processes per Dyno instead of 1), or (2) do intelligent routing for small groups of Dynos. Do you understand the problem with random routing, and why either of these two would solve it? If not you might find the paper I linked to previously very interesting:<p>""To motivate this survey, we begin with a simple problem that demonstrates a powerful fundamental idea. Suppose that n balls are thrown into n bins, with each ball choosing a bin independently and uniformly at random. Then the maximum load, or the largest number of balls in any bin, is approximately log n / log log n with high probability. Now suppose instead that the balls are placed sequentially, and each ball is placed in the least loaded of d >= 2 bins chosen independently and uniformly at random. Azar, Broder, Karlin, and Upfal showed that in this case, the maximum load is log log n / log d + (1) with high probability [ABKU99].<p>The important implication of this result is that even a small amount of choice can lead to drastically different results in load balancing. Indeed, having just two random choices (i.e., d = 2) yields a large reduction in the maximum load over having one choice, while each additional choice beyond two decreases the maximum load by just a constant factor.""<p>-- <a href=""http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook20...</a>",1365039714

I asked him what he thought of the terms, and he said that they are the most entrepreneur-unfriendly terms he has ever seen.  His main concern was how low the cap was set at.  He said I should insist on a $4M cap, and not accept anything under $2M.<p>My dilemma though, is we're currently pre-revenue; and I need this cash injection to propel my startup through our launch.<p>Isn't the cap on a convertible note akin to a pre-money company valuation?  If so, I honestly agree with the investor that we are only worth ~$500K. I mean, we're pre-revenue, so $500K is optimistic IMHO.<p>Personally, I have a proven track record of building and exiting companies.  Nothing huge; my last business was acquired for $250,000 last year.<p>I'm confident that I can make this business successful; but I don't want to screw myself over by taking this cash now, when in a year or so I may be seeking Series-A financing from a large VC; and don't want to turn them off by having accepted such poor seed investment terms.<p>Couple questions:<p>1) Do you feel like $120K with $500K cap, and 25% discount is really that bad of a deal?<p>2) If I take this deal as-is, do you anticipate backlash from future investors?<p>3) Where do I have negotiating leverage? Should I tell him I want a $2M cap but am willing to increase the discount to 30%? Should I offer to pay interest on the note?<p>4) I realize posting to HN is no substitute for bonafide legal counsel; so is there someone you would refer me to?<p>Thanks everyone.",1365037598

If you are trying to teach children ""correct"" grammar rules that they will go home and unlearn because their peers speak a different grammar, you are getting teaching very wrong and you should do it differently.

It means you teach it so they actually <i>learn</i> it.<p>Don't take this the wrong way, but highlighting ""your"" vs. ""you're"" indicates you really don't understand what we're talking about here. That is a difference of orthography, of spelling, which is completely unintuitive and frankly <i>stupid</i> to speakers of dialects in which those words are pronounced exactly the same way. <i>Any</i> native speaker, however perfect you consider their English, must be taught spelling by rote.

The account rep didn't say anything about keeping it private though, so I'm sharing in case any other publishers want to get a head start on revisions.<p>Basically eBay in general is making a big push toward attracting new and infrequent users to the site.[1]  EPN is changing their incentive structure to match that, increasing revenue share for traffic from new/infrequent eBay users, and decreasing it for other traffic.  Assuming traffic sent from publishers remains unchanged, this will result in a significant overall reduction in the amount being paid out.  (For us it's 40%; I expect that's on the high end of the range since most of your users already have eBay accounts, but it gives you a ballpark.)  They optimistically state that if publishers manage to drive an increased number of new and infrequent users, overall payments may instead increase, but that remains to be seen.<p>As mentioned, this will apparently be up on the EPN blog on Friday, and the changes will take effect April 15.  So if there's some way you can make your EPN displays more appealing to new or infrequent eBay users, you may want to give it a try.<p>On the plus side, they are also apparently planning to significantly improve the reporting tools, adding more details on what goes into the Quality Click Pricing calculation, as well as more granularity on the type of users being sent for each campaign, which will hopefully help publishers optimize for this new pricing scheme.<p>Again, I have no affiliation with eBay aside from being a member of the eBay Partner Network (their affiliate program).<p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5413300",1365037421

This situation holds also in the case of some customers leaving and never coming back (just by some adjustments in b and k).<p>For k, might fit to past data.  For given y(0) and b, all k does is adjust how fast the curve rises to the asymptote.  So basically all we are doing is interpolating between y(0) and b.<p>Otherwise, all viral curves are the same.<p>So, an advantage of my derivation is a simple, explicit equation for a fairly general solution.<p>The article has a comment claiming that biology addresses a similar problem and gets a 'logistic' curve.  The comment didn't say just what was meant by a logistic curve, but I suspect that my solution here is an example.  If so, then here we have an 'axiomatic' derivation of the logistic curve.<p>It is true that the growth of some products, e.g., TV sets, look to the eye very much like one of the curves from my solution for selected values of y(0), b, and k.<p>Could also make a Markov assumption:  So, assume that get new customers (and, if wish, lose old customers) at some 'rates' and, thus, get a continuous time, discrete state space Markov process.  Then as is well known the solution is a matrix exponential.  Could evaluate the matrix exponential or just use Monte Carlo to generate a few thousand sample paths.

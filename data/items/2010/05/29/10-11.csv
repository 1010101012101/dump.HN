Why do this?  Just, why?  It's almost unreadable.<p>Just write a short 20-line function which validates an email address.  Use if statements.  Write comments.  Then verify that your algorithm does in fact handle all corner cases, just like the regexp does.  (Your verifications will be in the form of short, simple unit test case functions.)<p>To encourage regexp abuse like that is to encourage bad programming.",1275130725

That's his business.<p>Get it?<p>This is not a pure critique, although it certainly has valid points. It's a drum-up-money speech. You don't drum up money by saying ""Yes, it has these problems, but hey, when personal computers were only 3 years old, we all had to swap floppies to move to the second half of our program!""<p>Being fair and pragmatic doesn't get you massive clicks and money, unless you are very, very skilled at delivering pragmatic advice in a delicious and entertaining package.

But I am not sure - the keyboard never appeared for me because I never pressed the menu button for a longer time. Now I tried it and it worked, but I already knew why because of the article.<p>In the other hand, I use my iPod Touch only very rarely. I think there is supposed to be some kind of tap bar (I know this from reading about PhoneGap), and I managed to bring up a menu once in a game I have installed by tapping around on the screen wildly. I was unable to bring it up a second time, so no, it is not always easy to identify the source of some activity.",1275129888

I'd suggest sticking to Python, a clean and pleasant language that 'fits my brain', to solve the problems you do have, until you bump into something that needs more. If/when what you can get for Python (from constraint solvers to whatever) proves insufficient.<p>Also, lookup ""Beware of the Turing tar-pit"". And see what Peter Norvig ( <a href=""http://norvig.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com</a> ) has to say. On the other hand, you may consider rule systems (see, e.g. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1363680"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1363680</a> ); but consider also how you'll debug and maintain them.",1275129482

1388595,story,,,12,12,Tichy,"Ask HN: app generators, OK or evil?",,"Ignoring the iPhone niche where they are not allowed to begin with, would you say app generators are acceptable?<p>The obvious issue is that they could be seen as spamming the app stores. But I tend to think that it just shows that discovery mechanisms in the app stores would have to improve. Even without app generators, there are already hundreds of thousands of apps, so they can't be searched manually anyway.<p>The web seems to do kind of fine with the issue. For example suppose I would generate an individual app for every free book on project Gutenberg. That would be a lot of apps. But at least on the web, it is possible to find and read individual Gutenberg books without too much of a problem (one book could be considered a page a ka ""app on the web""). They are not drowned out because there are so many of them. (I don't plan to do the book thing, it was just an example).<p>The alternative to the app generator would of course be a ""mother app"" that bundles all the other apps. The example would be an ebook reader with a special interface to project Gutenberg. Businesses might not be satisfied with that solution, though, they probably want an individual app for their brand.",1275129181

The cancer somehow damaged his left eye and the eye had to be removed or it would start spreading. So my math teacher took the heartbreaking decision to remove his son's left eye(His son was too young to decide for himself). A few years later, they discovered another malignant tumor in his right eye, so the teacher again took the decision to remove his right eye. Now you could imagine how horrible this must have been for both of them, but his son didn't give up and several years later he created a computer (or was it software?) designed for blind people. Not only did he get rich, but he also helped a lot of blind people.",1275127592

4052453,comment,4052441,4052441,1,0,YAFZ,,,"The ""Pedagogy"" section is superb: ""Systematically investigate the interaction of pedagogical approaches and motivational levels so that teachers can broaden participation. With school sites in Alaska, California, Georgia, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming and over 10,000 student-created games and simulations, we were able to explore a uniquely rich set of motivational and educational data.6 We found the main common factor supporting motivational levels and skills across different school contexts, gender, and ethnicity was scaffolding. Of all the factors we considered, scaffolding was the only significant one. Scaffolding, a pedagogical aspect indicating the degree and kind of support provided by a teacher, was assessed through classroom observation. Direct instruction, which provides a very high degree of scaffolding, highly polarized motivational levels between boys and girls. With direct instruction a teacher provides step-by-step instructions at a detailed level (for example, ""click this button,"" ""paint the frog green""). Direct instruction is particularly unappealing to girls. With less scaffolding, such as with guided discovery, a teacher employs a more inquiry-based approach that includes classroom discussion (such as ""what should we do?"" and ""how can we do this?""). In guided discovery, the motivational levels of girls not only approached the motivational levels of boys but often exceeded it. In a number of classes, using guided discovery raised the motivational levels of girls to 100%. This is exciting because it suggests that broadening participation is not a question of difficult-to-change factors such as school affluence. Preconceived notions such as lower interest of girls in programming turned out to be unsubstantiated. Even in cases where most literature would suggest a gender effect, for instance if there were significantly fewer girls in a class, we found that the right level of scaffolding could raise the level of motivation in girls to be even higher than that of boys.""",1338537588

4052424,comment,4050988,4050988,4,0,caustic,,,"> Pathological love for Java and anything resembling Java.<p>And I think that's the good thing. Over years I finally realized, it's not the programming language you use that matters, or makes you look smarter. It's the kind of problem you are trying to solve by writing code. Computer Science field is far, far reacher than the PL research subfield.<p>I mean, you may be writing another boring enterprise web application in Haskell, or solving Artificial Intelligence problem in Visual Basic. I would prefer later rather than former, although I hate VB. I know, both situations are contrived, this is just a thought experiment to illustrate my point.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love ""esoteric"" programming languages.  Few years ago I spent quite a lot of time playing with Haskell, Prolog  Lisp, etc, and I don't regret it. No, I don't use these on daily basis or going to, but I studied a hell lot of coll new stuff. Most importantly, it taught me about new _paradigms_ of programming, that I really think every programmer should understand.<p>These days, however, I try to squeeze as much math and algorithms from different domains as I can in my poor stupid head and I think that payoff of this would be much bigger for me.<p>PS<p>Few month ago at a local functional programming meetup some guys presented their Scala solution to a trivial problem of validating web forms in a rather trivial web application. Their solution employed the whole lot of functional stuff, like functors, mappings and the things whose names I forgot. I was trying to understand what they are doing but they lost me after fifth minute of the presentation. It took them maybe a week to write all this code. Do you see the irony?",1338537055

4052415,comment,4038113,4039236,1,0,yason,,,"Please don't think I was specifically arguing a point or arguing against one of your points, or reading into what you wrote specifically. I was merely <i>sharing because what you wrote touched</i> me. (It might not have come out that way in my writing, though, I admit.) And that all was mostly triggered by the line that I quoted in my earlier post.<p>Now, your situation is exceptional and something like that can't be assumed when speaking generally. It's similar to your spouse getting seriously ill. From being a husband or a parent it turns a relationship or a parenthood partly into a special case of taking full-time care of a very ill person. So in that case we're not strictly talking about only parenthood anymore. It's partly patient care, not just parenthood.<p>However, I think I still carry the same opinion: taking care of yourself first is <i>especially important</i> in a situation like yours where you might have to take care of someone into his adulthood.<p>A person can <i>only give as much as he's been able to receive</i> himself. If you don't put yourself first ever then eventually you imperatively have no chance of giving anything to your son or anyone else in the long run. (You might be able to trick it for years in the beginning, though.) It's like you have to stop to fill up the gas tank while driving a long distance. Otherwise you just can't do it at all.<p>I also want to point out that I was not advocating taking a long vacation with your wife just like that: putting yourself or your relationship first doesn't mean leaving your kids in abandon. (Or maybe, naively, for some people, it means just that but it wasn't what I was thinking.) I did write that parents can't just do whatever they feel they need to do and ignore the kids. I'll try to reiterate my viewpoint.<p>What I mean by putting yourself or your marriage first is that in the worst cases, you do just that, but only in the worst case. If it's not the worst case you will have <i>some</i> energy left for others, too.<p>For example, if you're truly out of the game, you must be able to say to your wife ""Honey, now I just can not do this anymore. I need a weekend alone at the cottage or with my friends or I'll just simply go mad somehow and I don't have anything left for myself or our marriage. I'm sorry I can't be more flexible now and you'll have to take care of all things but I'm so out of everything now that I just can't. I'll be backbut not today.""<p>Or if you're exhausted with your kids, you're going to have to be able to say: ""Listen guys, we're so worn out of everything that we're going to have to postpone the beach trip we planned with you and instead send you off to your grandparents for the weekend. You see, we need some adult time alone with your mother so that we'll have time to enjoy ourselves too instead of always working and taking care of others. If we didn't do that, we'd become quite uptight and just plain angry at everything, and you wouldn't like that either. So, we're going to have to take you out to the beach sometime later and you're going to go visit your grandparents for the weekend.""<p>Of course you have the responsibility for your kids and you can't drop <i>that</i>. But kids can survive a night without a proper meal. They will live even if they don't have clean clothes for few days. And they can't always enjoy the privilege of your full presence. Doing <i>such things repeatedly would be detrimental</i> to their childhood but in the worst case it's better for them to suffer little than see their parents gradually losing their grasp on life.",1338536811

4052405,comment,4050988,4051873,7,0,tikhonj,,,"I can't comment on Lisp (except to say that Scheme is awesome), but I think you are very far from the mark on functional programmers in general.<p>In particular, Haskellers worry about maintainability <i>far more</i> than normal programmers. One of the main advantages of functional programming is that it makes reasoning about the code--including ensuring correctness--much easier.<p>Haskell enforces referential transparency, limits IO interactions with the type system, allows you to encode some fairly complex invariants in types and, despite all this, has some of the best testing software around in QuickCheck (which goes beyond unit tests).<p>In my experience, Haskell programs tend to have smaller, less coupled parts with better defined invariants. You don't have to worry about a large class of errors right off the bat: you can't get null pointer exceptions, functions you call can't have any unexpected side effects, you won't get type errors at runtime and so on.<p>If anything, Haskellers worry about correctness <i>too much</i>. Happily, this is offset a bit by the language which happens to be very expressive and productive. You can also get very good performance from high-level code and even unoptimized code tends to be decently fast. Some people also find it hard to learn, but that's simply a cultural issue. Somebody already familiar with functional programming has much less difficulty picking it up, but even without much functional experience the basics shouldn't take <i>too</i> long.",1338536321

4052403,comment,4050988,4050988,16,0,antirez,,,"A few days ago I was at a conference and there was this Google recruitment desk, with gadgets and two nice guys.\nI walked near the desk and said: ""Hi, can I have a t-shirt for my son?"", and they said sure, asking me to compile a form in an Android tablet.<p>Basically it was a list of programming questions, and out of 5 questions I was able to reply only to three. One was the time complexity of heap sort, that's pretty obvious, another one a probability theory quiz about trowing balls into bins, also pretty reasonable. Another one I can't remember, still pretty general.<p>Then there were this two questions I was not able to reply: one was about Java argument passing conventions in some specific kind of method I can't even remember (I can't write ""Hello World"" in Java). Another was about graph theory and adjacent Matrix.<p>Well, my idea is, that a big percentage of Google problems are due to this kind of hiring process. It's good if I know the fundamental algorithms as a programmer, but why I'm required to know Java as it was a pre-requisite to be a good programmer? About graph theory, it's something that is rarely used, if I need to do something I can grab a book and check it, it's strange to remember this stuff when you don't use it a lot.<p>Now hiring only guys that know exactly the Java calling convetions AND graph theory means to apply a big filter between the programming world and your company. This filter is good as it's cool to know a lot of things, but it's also bad because, for instance, a lot of good programmers I know don't care about Java at all, and while they may have a generally good understanding of algorithms they don't remember how to factor a number with polland-rho, or dynamic programming, and so forth.<p>This filter does not tell you nothing about the real ability of the candidate to write good programs, to use the right abstractions, and to design beautiful systems. Actually it <i>may</i> tell you that the candidate is focused on the details, and the brain is a zero-sum game sometimes.<p>Another thing I'm pretty convinced of is that this kind of candidates is not <i>the only kind of employees</i> you want if you want to enter the social network business and compete with Facebook. Your output as a company will be a system that little resembles what average people want.<p>So the #1 problem of Google IMHO is to allow more internal divesification of cultures and programming backgrounds.",1338536246

Lots of people are unable to play the game they've paid $60 (or 60 EUR !!!) money for. ""Always online"" was supposedly for security, but people trying to play ""single player"" are getting their accounts hacked. The story and its presentation is an insult to intelligence. Bosses are extremely talkative, and not in the amusing way like in Realm of the Mad God. Cutscenes are used as interruptions. It is also the least random and most linear Diablo game. Low replayability is a big deal because difficulty level (difficulty, no skill level like they were called in Quake)\nAnd all this took more than 10 years to make ? It resembles Diablo Nukem Forever.<p>There is a lot to complain about. But it's not surprising considering the founders work elsewhere, especially at Runic Games. Torchlight 2 is also very colorful and cartoony, but it's not pretending to be something it's not (a grim, gothic game). TL2 is playful and doesn't treat itself very seriously.<p>My favorite action RPG game is Nox, though.

You hit if you aim well and enemy is in range.\n  - no dodge chance. You dodge if you move out of the way.\n  - no shield block chance. You block if you raise your shield in time (and in correct direction :-)\n  - no random levels, but levels very well done and non-linear unlike Diablo 3. Also, some chapters are unique to one of 3 classes.\n  - very unimportant resists: very few arbitrary decisions ""You can't use weapon/spell X against monster Y"".\n  - as a result, combat is so fun that multiplayer had modes like Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, and Team Deathmatch, where everyone was always on the same level.\n  - huge variety and creativity in Conjurer and Wizard classes.<p>See the pattern ?

She finds game here and there that <i>really</i> grab her interest, but everything else just gets a ""meh"". F2P means the ability to sample, no sunken cost besides a little bandwidth usage. It's better than demos were, because if the game is a winner, there's no transition hassle from demo to full product - you just keep on playing.",1338534117

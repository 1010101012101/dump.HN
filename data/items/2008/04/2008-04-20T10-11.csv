168429,comment,168277,168333,0,0,DaniFong,,,"People were all psyched up for more self affirming startup things. Even I seem to operate in a 'startup' mode and a hacker mode. It seems weird. I spent most of my week on machine learning. Yet after hours of talks on  entrepreneurship, Norvig's talk of clustering and segmentation made my mental gears switch. I don't think people expected it.",1208688798

But if that application won't work on windows, SqlServer and IIS. I will never be able to make the case for it and push it.<p>Maybe after I successfully introduce few OOS business apps and Dev framework, I can start to make a call for a linux server, but not before.",1208688429
168425,comment,168400,168424,0,0,jrockway,,,"> hey, you are that dude who wrote the catalyst book<p>yup :)<p>Anyway, I agree that Perl on Windows is painful.  Most of the developers use UNIX variants, so naturally support on the UNIX side is going to be better.  Basically, I think it's best to take the path of least resistance.  If using Windows is important to you, you'll have fewer problems if you use the Microsoft stack.  If Perl is important to you, you should just use UNIX.  It's a shame that we have to make compromises like this, but sometimes you just need to get your work done :)<p>But anyway, I've used DBD::Sybase with modern versions of SQL Server.  It worked fine to get a UNIX application to talk to a remote SQL Server instance and call stored procedures.  DBIx::Class also works.",1208687459
168424,comment,168400,168410,0,0,systems,,,"hey, you are that dude who wrote the catalyst book (<a href=""http://www.packtpub.com/catalyst-perl-web-application/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.packtpub.com/catalyst-perl-web-application/book</a>)<p>Nice to see you're into hacker news, anyway.<p>I would like to recommend Groovy and Grails, the main advantage of these over Perl/Catalyst for me was portability, Groovy/Grails or GG just work better on windows and SQL Server 2005. They were way easier to install, run and getting started with. For example with Perl/Catalyst, Perl doesn't have a DBD::MSSql, I think one can use JDBC or DBD::JDBC, but JDBC is at version 0.1 and DBD::JDBC is also old DBD::Sybase, is well Sybase!<p>DB support of GG via hibernate is just way more robust.<p>Java have many many more active projects which GG relies on and can depend on.<p>Perl's CPAN is for sure fantastic, but CPAN is just not as portable as Java's project, so with GG you know, and I know, that it will run on windows, with Perl, there is no guaranty<p>Finally the moral is, with open source, you really have to consider a project popularity. Project that are too centralized, that do not rely on other popular project are doomed to get in your way!<p>Catalyst relies on CPAN modules, this alone, assure me it is a better option than RoR, because a lot more people are working on the different pieces idependently, the work is better distributed, DBD::JDBC is usefull for a lot more project, not only Catalyst, this suggest it will better survive and evolve,  RoR is full stack, so do evolve it will add a lot more work for its developer, and its open source, so no guaranty you will find one to do the work!<p>GG situation is even better than catalyst, it relies on an even more popular and solid foundation.<p>New Open Source Poject should always trie to introduce the least amount of new code!<p>I do believe that the future for Ruby, Tcl, Python and Perl should be on either Parrot or the JVM this will make it easier for new project to rely on other people's work, will improve portability etc ...<p>I will not drop Perl/Catalyst from my knowledge efforts, I very strongly believe in the Perl community, and that the current problems will be solved in ways that will even push Perl beyond Java<p>Hope i was clear",1208686308

Since you're new to website business(?) they could even try to shut you off by setting the price even higher. That way they wouldn't need to actually implement your custom build site. And if you would take the offer they would atleast get some nice profits.<p>I work in this business as a employee of a professional web firm and a freelancer. I have come across a lot of clients that think they know what they want but actually don't. You should know that when you want something custom build, its going to cost you, by the hour and more.<p>1. Write clear specs. If you know software development you should know how to write clear specs. Try to drop features that are not important. There is a lots of stuff that could go wrong, besides the site, so could it work with less features?<p>2. Freelance designers are actually good. Find one that you like and provide the layout for the web firm, so the firm will only do the technical side and you will probably save some bucks.<p>3. Do as much as you can by yourself. Draw the basic structure of a site in powerpoint/gimp or whatever. Just some boxes that show eg. where is navigation, header, news, some featured products etc. Draw all the different pages and try to write or draw how the site should work.<p>4. You don't need to use a Wisconsian web firm. It's not like there is lots of shipping involved. If you want to discuss the deal in person, a cost of few airline tickets probably isn't too much if you can get better deal.",1208685803

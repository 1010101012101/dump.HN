He may truly be a country boy at heart, but there's little stopping him from doing it now… it's just an escapist fantasy.<p>I always wonder if people who claim to want to travel the world have ever actually done enough travel to know how brutal it can be to, in fact, travel the world. I spent 9.5 weeks traveling around the world last year and it just about killed me.<p>Most people can't separate ""feeling an impulse to do something"" and ""knowing it's the real deal for the rest of your life."" My husband is one of those types who always wants to move to wherever we're vacationing, but since they're usually backwaters, I know for a fact he'd end up miserable. It's just that they feel good because they're away from obligations. (The real thing is that he doesn't enjoy the work he's doing but he's not ready to admit it to himself yet!)",1281794147

The problem here isnt that Google did what it did, it's that they shouted about it for the other side for so long, and then switched teams.  The same thing with China.  If you're going to take a hard stance on something, then do it and people will respect it for you.  But Google is turning into all talk and no walk, and walking straight into the next Microsoft.<p>If they had just said from the beginning that they were out for their own interest (just like everyone else), and not tried to play the good guy even when it would hurt them, then nobody would be surprised by this.",1281792967

1603312,comment,1602383,1603007,0,0,sasidharm,,,"I hate software patents, but it is the reality of the world. Google had a chance to license with Sun, but they did not want to yield any control to Sun and implemented their own technology for the mobile platforms. Sun/Oracle believe they violated their patents in this process. So they are suing Google. I do not see this as Oracle going after open source technologies. 
Google is no champion of open technologies. No corporate company that has to answer their stock holders every three months can be a true champion of open source.
They are open only as long as it suits their business model. Right now making Android open source suits their business model bcos every stupid carrier on the planet can build a stupid android skin on their own, and Google can claim that Android is not a locked platform. 
Sun tried to be truly open and they literally went bankrupt.",1281792193

But in the long term, at the moment I agree with this observation in the article which captures the most relevant and important issue for me:<p><i>Forrester Research analyst John Rymer agrees [ this will have a chilling effect on developers ]: ""I think this lawsuit casts the die on Java’s future,"" he said. ""It will become a slow-evolving legacy technology. Oracle’s lawsuit links deep innovation in Java with license fees, and that will kill deep innovation in Java by anyone outside Oracle or startups hoping to sell out to Oracle. Software innovation just doesn’t do well in the kind of environment Oracle just created.""</i><p>""Deep innovation"" in e.g. JVM GC for functional languages (Clojure) is <i>exactly</i> the sort of thing I'm interested in ... and that's now at best on hold while I get a better grasp of this mess and its implications.

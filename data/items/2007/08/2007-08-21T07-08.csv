This sort of thing has been done before:<p><a href=""http://www.multicians.org/thvv/boyd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.multicians.org/thvv/boyd.html</a><p>...but I think it's more suitable when kids are younger.

books put the language in the background.<p>My recommendation: Get the book ""How to Design Programs"". You can check it out at www.htdp.org first.

And so, if you <i>choose</i> a school, and if you choose the ""best"", it happens to be the one with the best students.  When everyone does this, it quickly leads to a regression to the mean. <p>Depending on the geography, this isn't a problem. But in an area in which there are wildly different populations of students near one another (as in many cities, where the poor and rich neighborhoods exist close by) it won't work. Parents in rich neighborhoods won't stand and watch the average IQ of their public school drop 15 points as idiots are bused in.",1187682049

It's going to make a lot of things easier and some new things possible.<p>One huge gain will be high resolution streaming. Until now you had to pay thousands of dollars to buy the proprietary VP6 encoder. Soon you'll be able to use H264 directly. This is going to be a really big deal.<p>This is also a strong indicator that the iPhone is about to have Flash.

Javascript is beautiful, but not the DOM, and as have been said he would need to learn at least some HTML.<p>On the other side, using only Javascript with a stand-alone interpreter would be a nice.<p>I would go for Logo.<p>[edit: a couple of spelling mistake]",1187681417

Compilers attract both academics, for the theory, and low-level hackers who want their language to be as fast as possible.<p>For instance, parsing is one area that has been researched in incredible depth and the parsers that you find in modern compilers (often) reflect this research.<p>There are also many interesting algorithms found in things such as register allocation, control flow analysis etc.<p>Personally, I find working on compilers fascinating. If you've never written any sort of interpreter or compiler, I would recommend giving it a go. Creating a language that you actually use to program is immensely satisfying.<p>There's also the point that if you are interested in optimisation then compilers are a fantastic place to get stuck in Optimise a part of a spreadsheet program and, well, your spreadsheet program will be quicker. But improve the code generator of your compiler and every program will be quicker!",1306407201

They were members of a committee (Grandi Rischi), part of a government agency (Protezione Civile). They are accused because of their public 'role'. The title is somewhat misleading, it should be: ""Italian Major Risks Committee to be tried etc."", if you search in italian press the trial is called ""Processo grandi rischi"", ""Major Risks trial"".<p>(My opinion is that the congress was just a 'public relations' thing to 'reassure' people. The words ""the scientific community tells me there is no danger"", served, very likely, as an excuse for the 'politicians' to do nothing in order to prevent risks [because of the typical italian cynicism, I can't assure they were not aware of the misuse of their words.]<p>Please note that after the earthquake the public debate was focused on the stupid problem of 'prediction of earthquakes'. Yes we can't predict earthquakes, but we can predict the effect and take measures in order to prevent risks. And it is clear that nothing was done.)<p>[Excuse me for my bad english.]",1306405267

The scientists say that the meeting was too short to consider all the data, while the civil protection agency responds to them that they should have not waited six months to object to that.<p>An aside: back in 2009, before and after the quake, there was one guy claiming to be able to foresee when and where earthquakes would strike with a certain precision by measuring radon emissions. Except the quake he foresaw a week earlier nearby L'Aquila never happened, and after the big one caused 300 deaths, he went on record saying to have foreseen it by something like 6 to 24 hours, depending on which interview. He became somewhat popular at the time, and probably still is, to the point that the public opinion might be left with the notion that quakes can indeed be foreseen - this trial might not be that bad thing for science after all.",1306404978

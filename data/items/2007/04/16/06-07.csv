13233,comment,13219,13227,0,0,natrius,,,"I'm sure they got decent paychecks out of it, but I doubt it was ""fuck you"" money. They're still going to have to start another business or work for someone else in a scenario where making money will still be important. If I was really passionate about an idea and Google bought it just to let it stagnate, I'd be pissed. If someone is going to buy something that I've put my heart into, they're going to have to either pay me enough that I'll never have to worry about money again, or ensure that I'll get to see my vision through. The Dodgeball guys didn't get either of those.<p>For an example of a situation that I'd like to be in, look at Thawte. By selling it, Mark Shuttleworth got enough money that he could do things he was passionate about but might not be profitable in the near future, like paying people to write open source software. For me, it would be investing my time and money in the education of others to make sure more people could reach their full potential.<p>So if someone swindled me out of a business I wanted to see actually change the world in exchange for a couple of million dollars and the expectation that I'd be able to keep developing that business, I'd be pissed. It just puts you in a middle zone where you don't have to worry about money that much, but you still can't do whatever you want. That's lame.",1176705970

13225,comment,13149,13186,0,0,natrius,,,"Actually, it's mostly just other people's content copied to the site without their permission. For instance, the #3 and #4 items on Scribd right now are taken straight from craigslist's best of section. A lot of the other items are from email forwards, but that's a use that I think Scribd is actually good for.<p>With that said, it seems like the whole point of scribd is to be digg fodder in the first place. It's difficult to build a community around text, because any user who gets that serious will probably outgrow Scribd and start their own blog. Youtube succeeded in creating a community because there's no way for most users to go off and create their own video sites. When YouTube first launched, if you wanted to post video online, using YouTube was pretty much your only option. People have plenty of options for text, most of which are more featureful for publishers than Scribd.<p>Without a real community, Scribd is basically just a glorified email forward hosting site for digg users. If you look at the issues all the Myspace-based companies are having, you'll probably agree that Scribd could have a difficult future. If digg decides to let users upload content directly using digg itself, Scribd is dead.",1176704401

(I'm a PhD student in Astrophysics.)<p>I realized something.  Contrary to the article, most great scientists don't really care what the answer to that question is.  Most great scientists love a topic, and through the greatness of their research, make the topic important.<p>The universe is wonderful in that way.  You can study something as lowly as a comet, and it can help you understand how the universe began.  Scientists who can tie these subjects together are great scientists.<p>To tie this thread into startups. Ideas are a dime a dozen.  It's implementation that matters.",1176704338

But I decided to just go in with confidence, and I learned all I could about the research I was presenting.<p>My talk was at the end of a long day, and due to a poorly organized conference, most of the potential audience had gotten fed up and gone home before I even got a chance to give my talk.

We had to roll our own because our application is built on Adobe Flex, and traditional advertising services (ie. Google AdSense) won't work. Besides that, we want our advertisements to be a bit more visually appealing than the standard boxes you see throughout the web today.<p>In order to get our system tested and off the ground, we need companies to advertise with us, and I figured News.YC would be a great place to ask. How interested would any of you be in helping us test our ad system? We'd be offering discounted rates, of course, and you'd get a pretty nice looking ad. This is kind of a ""startups helping startups"" situation: we need help getting our ad system tested, stable, and off the ground, and we want to help other startups by providing some cheap advertising.<p>Please note that this post is solely to gauge interest. It'll still be a while until we're ready to go.<p>More information: http://www.galaxyit.com/index.php?page=game",1207154464

Randomly selected SOAP implementations are just not likely to interoperate. We eventually coaxed PHP5's SOAP server stuff into talking to both .NET 2.0 and Java (with Netbeans 5.5's J2EE libs) clients - IIRC we recommend SOAP 1.0 for one, and SOAP 1.1 for the other.<p>A week after we finished Netbeans 6.0 was released, and the SOAP client stuff that's bundled with it wouldn't play well with our server.<p>From the client end: /if/ you can actually talk SOAP successfully, things work nicely. You just call the generated stubs and the RPC happens transparently. If I was calling our web service from C# I would choose SOAP every time.<p>The REST stuff would be a pain to use if you had to use the DOM to read the XML that comes back, because, well, the DOM is painful. If parsing what comes back isn't a pain, REST works well. For internal clients, we prefer REST/JSON with the standard PHP json parser.",1207154430

They have the skills, but he is looking for a particular mindset (as well as other specifics).<p>Some of the things he stressed were that they should:<p>- Ideally be from Denver, CO or surrounding areas
- Be young
- Be fresh
- Be especially good with Java (damn good)
- Want a laid back atmosphere with LOTS of room to grow
- Want good compensation for their work (solid starting pay (very negotiable, with bonuses and raises from the get-go); he thinks (as I agree) that those who are the best only deserve the best.
- Can handle a fast-paced industry and like working 1-on-1 with the boss to bring solid formulas and ideas into a working reality quickly<p>This all brought me to wonder what I can do to help him find the people who meet those descriptions, and what he can do to make people think, ""I really want to work at this place.""<p>What do you guys think are the best ways to bring fresh, young, damn good talent to the table; and even more so, keep them there and keep them inspired?<p>PS: If you fall into this criteria or know someone who does, let me know.

I am top for the main 3 - 4 word terms, (suffering a slight drop with the latest end march google update) that said the next term were going after is the big one and will bring 4 fold the traffic we have now.<p>My position is this, if your not into seo and your doing a startup then you better have some nice friends, and hope to make the first page of TC etc. Else you will sit there with 50 hits a day and most of them will be from crawlers.<p>I have no 'nice friends' apart from my seo adviser. I'm lucky he is a good friend and trained me well. Now I have a site that has tremendous growth, targeted traffic that sticks about (and comes back) and absoulty zero effort wasted on pitching for editorial, advertising, other marketing, etc.<p>I could care less about word of mouth because it is very hit and miss. People only want to talk about you if you have upset them or if you have a real game changer. Competing or slogging it out in established markets, like music for example just doesn't get the masses enthused to enough to chat about (mind everyone will blog about you if TC did so that's a bonus of being T.cked.)<p>I often check my apps progress with compete and benchmark it against sites that are in the same market that are going for the big bucks, VC backing, big splashes of editorial on TC, advertising and generally hustling their way in, and while I am often behind there initial curves the encouraging thing is my traffic is constantly rising and Im nipping at there ankles as they dip after the sharp rises, while also building a large net to crawl the ocean of organic search traffic.<p>I also freelance, coding and SEO, and it's really amazing talking to potential clients that are working on startups, they are interested in me helping them with their apps, but when I say, look the best advice I can help you with is not coding but in getting your SEO sorted out - blank faces stare back. Just like all the examples given in this article, they are equally nonchalant.<p>The biggest laugh for me was a competitor who had made TC because it had been backed with 5 million USD or some other worthless currency and when I did the quick seo scan (10 secs work) the biggest laugh of my life (index=1 page).<p>Alas I don't expect that the startups I see here will change there focus and concentrate on SEO anytime soon, the general opinion that seems to be prevalent  is that SEO is like web1, and social graphs and viral marketing will build the traffic.<p>That is a huge shame, I feel a huge empathy for the fellow entrepreneur's on this board, sharing many of the same trials and tribulations I feel like I also share some of the same genes, and this is nothing more than a little clan, and I want nothing  more than to see my fellow clan members go out and change the world.

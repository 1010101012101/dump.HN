529928,comment,529584,529677,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I don't think morals have to enter into it. If a country artificially ties its currency to the dollar for purposes of inflating trade, it's going to end up with a bunch of dollars that aren't worth so much.<p>Seems like natural consequences to me.<p>I'm dubious that the system is so simple that simply changing the reserve currency is going to fix anything. But if I were an expert in international finance, I wouldn't be working on startups. And I'd probably be a lot more boring.",1237888559

529922,comment,529552,529552,0,0,Luc,,,"I've seen an even simpler non-moving device to reduce electricity use in supermarket freezers. Because the air in the freezer gains heat more quickly than the produce, the freezer switches on too often. A simple sleeve for the thermometer made in a material with heat capacity comparable to the produce makes the thermometer measure something closer to the temperature of the food. It got tested by the standards agency in the UK and is getting used in some supermarket chains (I'd post a link if I could find one!).",1237887788

The lockboxes must be filled before Victor makes his choice, you cannot change their contents afterwards. Therefore, you cannot return the actual problem when he chooses that and 12345678 when he chooses a row or column. That would require changing the boxes after his choice.<p>Also, if all rows contain 12345678 (same order), then columns contain 111111111, 222222222, ...., 999999999, not 12345678.",1243410345

628151,comment,626518,626518,0,0,SecurityMatters,,," I have never understood why most people even created PayPal accounts.  A PayPal like system that worked well would be very convenient.  But, when I go try to create an account, I always get stopped by the Terms of Service.  How could anyone think that is reasonable?  Why should I waive my cardholder rights for an associated credit card?  If you walked into a store and they asked you to waive your rights under your cardholder agreement in order to use a credit card, would you do it?  And, then you read about the dispute resolution process.  It is clear that if you ever get any money out of the system, you should just consider yourself lucky.\n I'd say that if you think of money in the system as play money and don't care about any associated bank account or credit card, then PayPal would be OK.  Otherwise, it is not reasonable.  I conclude that most people don't read the agreement, and just hope.",1243409080

628134,comment,627666,628087,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I was using boring to be the opposite of charming. Maybe boorish is a better word.<p>However, although it is counterintuitive, I stand my ground. My job (until I stopped doing it) involved a weird intersection of art and technology. My roommates (when I had them) have all been artists. I know every gallery owner in San Francisco, I help set up friend's shows. Art is sort of ""my thing"" outside of programming. Thus I feel like I know a little bit about that world. The guys simply are not getting any. Sexual frustration is probably one of the driving factors for most contemporary art. The better the art, the less sex the artist is having. At a certain point the art becomes good enough to result in an odd sort of fame and fortune and then the artist may get to have sex again. However it's still less frequent than you'd think just because visual art does not carry the same cultural cachet as music, movies, pro wrestling or reality TV.<p>I know less about musicians but I used to be a really good jazz pianist and that got me nowhere with women. In fact it's taken years of heavy drinking to expunge all knowledge of jazz and piano from my system, and it still surfaces from time to time, rendering me involuntarily celibate.  Have you been to a jazz show lately? It's all nerdy dudes. You'll have better luck with women by making inappropriate presentations at a ruby programming conference than you will by being a jazz musician. I snuck out to a jazz show last weekend and when I got home I lied to my girlfriend and told her I had met up with an ex for a drink. I knew she'd find that more forgivable. Of course, when people say musician these days they don't mean a jazz musician, they mean the Jonas Brothers and Dave Matthews. Sure, those guys are getting laid, probably even with similarly aged fans. But for every famous pop musician there are thousands of real musicians slaving away at their instrument with little hope of future procreation. Just read some Zed Shaw, he supposedly practices guitar 8 hours a day and you can tell by the tone of his rants that he hasn't had sex in almost a decade.<p>Now what about that statistic that said people who majored in studio art were 0% virgins? I'll grant that artists who go to art school definitely do get laid... while they are at art school. It's well established that art school chicks are the easiest women on the planet. I taught a ""programming for artists"" type course at an art school once and not a class session went by when I wasn't at least vaguely propositioned, and I was the instructor. Even the ugly fat dude who is supremely awesome at airbrushing dragons will get laid ONCE at art school. However, that's only because the messed up female artist who makes hand puppets out of her own hair decided to use the sexual encounter as the final project for her conceptual art elective. Once all these people get out of art school, the women all date gallery owners and lawyers and the guys never have sex again.",1243407869

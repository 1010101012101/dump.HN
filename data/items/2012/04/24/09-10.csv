3883196,comment,3882817,3882941,7,0,drostie,,,"It's really unfortunate that the ""podcast"" amounts to the authors reading a press release. Good physicists -- and I think these guys probably are good physicists -- can often give an intuitive picture of what such a density limit is, why it exists, what we think is going wrong in the field today. Because they were confined to just two minutes, it seems, they were forced to alternate awkwardly between reading a prepared statement which explains little and name-drops a couple of ridiculously broad fields (""radiation physics"" and ""magnetohydrodynamics"") briefly.<p>I mean, there is always a problem with oversimplifying these things, but talking to a layperson doesn't have to be too much different from talking to a fellow physicist; the key difference for me seems to be presenting two or three perspectives on the same thing before going forward.<p>Here is the backstory to this paper, as I would explain it to laypeople: ""So we've got this plasma -- plasmas are like a metallic gas, lightning is a good example; the electrons get shared between the gas molecules so the gas becomes an amazing conductor. Same thing happens whenever we superheat any gas, really. So we've got this superheated gas in a tokamak, which is a big ring which uses magnets to keep the plasma spinning around in a circle without hitting the edges. It's a neat trick, a bit hard to do. Now if we could get the plasma hot enough and dense enough, we could recreate the conditions in the Sun with it, and solve the energy crisis -- this is what's called fusion energy, much cleaner than nuclear fission. But how do we heat it up? Well like I said, this plasma is metallic, it's just like the wire in a light bulb, so we just put a lot of electricity through it, and it heats up and glows. We call that ""ohmic heating"". But there's a problem. Before it gets hot enough for controlled fusion, we basically run into a wall, we try to pour more current into it and it doesn't get hotter, doesn't get more dense.* And until now we didn't really know why this happened. It's as if the laws of nature just said, 'Eff you, I'm not letting you solve the world's energy problems that easily.' We have an explanation, now, why...""<p>I haven't read the paper yet but I hope it can rise a bit to a better technical level than the press releases. The press releases are a little elliptical about what their solution entails but it sounds like you have to understand what's happening with certain observed impurities in the plasma.<p>* From what one of the press releases says it sounds like it might actually kill the containment field and fly apart, but that sounds really strange -- as if it would destroy the tokamak.",1335261495

3883194,comment,3878522,3883177,2,0,edanm,,,"I agree with this in theory. Here's our problem: What we're mostly looking for is customers who need to build systems, and come to use to build them. Whether it's doing it per-hour, or taking some product specification and building it.<p>What we aren't doing is going to companies that already have systems, and improving them. We're more focused on building products from scratch.<p>It's possible that the problem is with our focus - but this seems the most natural fit for us right now.<p>So I guess these are the questions:<p>1. Should we be focusing elsewhere?<p>2. If so, how do we find the kind of customers you're talking about?<p>3. If not, how do we take a customer, who's a lone guy or a company with a new product, and use the techniques above to present ourselves differently?",1335261464

The US government <i>was</i> infiltrated by actual communist spies (to the extent that they practically ran the State Department in the '50s), and it's hard to argue with the hundred million or so it killed in the 20th century. It's easy to say that there have been no properly realised communist societies/states, but an honest account has to hold the idea responsible for the ubiquitous oppression and murder committed by regimes attempting to create them.<p>I won't argue that the Americans you talked to can give a <i>reasoned</i> condemnation of communism, but with its historical baggage the burden tends to swing the other way. It's hard to have a rational argument with a lot of people about Nazism, but it's hard to criticise people for trusting that it's not for them.",1335261414

The problem here is the lack of backward compatibility of packages, and frankly, if you need to rely on packages which change API willingnily betwen e.g. 1.5 and 1.6, or if each of your service depends on a different version of some library, you have bigger problems anyway.<p>Well, you said there are possibilities of problems but that they shouldnt matter in an ideal world. Maybe youre okay to take the chances but Im not. Every code I deploy has been tested rigorously against a certain set of versions and that is the only combination of dependencies Im willing to consider working. UnitTests with different dependencies are just as worthless like integration/functional tests against sqllite instead of the same DB type as in production.<p>Theres even the possibility that your code works because of a bug and when that one gets fixed, you app goes south because of some weird side-effect.<p>> any sufficiently complex deployment will depend on things that are not python, at which point you need a solution that integrates multiple languages. That is, you re-creating what a distribution is all about.<p>Im not sure if I understand what you mean, but yes if you want to use certain features outside the Python ecosystem, youll have to buckle up and package them yourself too. We cant do that, package XYZ is missing/too old. isnt really a good excuse to not do something that is important/good for your business. And thats one of the main points of the article.<p>> virtualenv relies on sources, so if some of your dependences are in C, every deploy means compilation<p>Thats wrong if you go the way described: The virtualenv is packaged with the code. Build tools dont belong on production servers.<p>> I still have no idea how security is handled when you put everything in virtualenv<p>Just as everywhere else. If you think its okay to tell customers that their data has been hacked because debian was to slow to issue a fix, be my guest. We cant afford that. What happens on my servers security wise is _my_ responsibility and using ancient versions of Python libraries just to be able to blame others for FUBARs is not a solution in my book.",1335259209

I've mostly seen it in Windows shops, but it's by no means limited to that. A common ""anti-pattern"" I've seen is to build a vmware image, or set of images, that run your ""environment"". Developers then spin up copies and request changes that they need be made to the ""master copy"".<p>When it's time to test and deploy, the code is deployed to a vmware image, which is then sent to the testers. When everything checks out, the code is once again deploy to a new copy of the image, which is then promoted to production.<p>On argument we've seen is that it makes it easy to do a rollback of the system, using vmware snapshots. It might be a sensible idea in some cases, I just thing it's a bit weird and some overhead.<p>The worst use case of this I've seen is a Telco, where you needed to spin up as much 12 vms, depending one what you and your teams was working on.

I'm not sure what kind of task would be applicable for you, but I do a simple database manipulation in python. Some people will just do the minimum that works (or sometimes doesn't), but some will send the whole git repository, show that they did tdd, generate documentation, handle logging/reporting, etc. It becomes obvious quickly who do you talk to.<p>These are done at home before the interview - I don't think we need to worry about anyone getting outside help to get a perfect answer. With the amount of bad/mediocre answers the onesI'm looking for tend to really stand out. And issues can be verified at the interview.<p>The trick is to invite people to go as far as <i>they</i> want instead of giving strict boundaries. And lots of time. If it should take an hour to complete, give out a couple of days before the interview anyway. If the answer is really good, the interviewed person will be able to talk for hours about the details.",1335258082

For example, a decision like deciding to defend a group instead of sacrificing it (which comes up all the time) often snowballs really quickly.</i><p>I do that too, but you have a lot of room to back out before your one mistake becomes a losing mistake.  If I neglect a group inappropriately, and then make it heavy, and then try desperately to defend it, and eventually fail to survive with no compensation, that's a lot of mistakes; and I usually could have chosen to stop and cut my losses for quite a while before it came fatal.<p>In chess, you can have long sequences in the midgame and endgame when the game is on a fine tactical balance, and one not-obviously-awful, ill-considered move can either put you in an immediately resignable state or make you spend the rest of the game fighting on the brink of defeat, trying to draw.  And that's not really a style of play you can opt out of if your opponent chooses it.",1335258005

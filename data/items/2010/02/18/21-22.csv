The iPhone can't use another processor without recompiling all the apps, but Windows Phone is processor independent.<p>Not that it really matters as it looks like the ARM monoculture is going to continue for a while. At least ARM is a sensible architecture, unlike the power-sucking monstrosity that is x86 and the hardware to support its weird and wonderful instructions.",1266527058

There is a popular saying in the wine industry: ""The best way to get a small fortune from the wine industry is to start with a large one."" Most producers of fine wines lose money. Owning a winery is a badge of honor among the ultra wealthy, often at the expense of being a terrible investment.<p>In any hits-driven business, like wines, there is a large risk. It's more akin to starting a rock band than a traditional business. For every Screaming Eagle there are hundreds of upstarts who can't even push bottles at $30.<p>It's not fair to evaluate the pricing of only the most successful. That's like saying rock CDs cost too much because the Rolling Stones make billions off of them. Sure, maybe, but overall the industry's profit margin is in line with other industries with similar risks and opportunity costs. Since we live in a free market, if it were not competition would spring up until it were.",1266526849

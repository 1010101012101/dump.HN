My basic plug for it is that it feels sort of like collaborative programming in English, and, perhaps for that reason, a high percentage of players tend to be programmers.  Among other things, this means that we prefer to explicitly define procedures rather than leaving things up to consensus, and that we&#x27;re a bit more literal-minded than you&#x27;d see in a real legal system - if a rule clearly states something, it means it, even if it contradicts the intent, and trying to find bugs and &quot;scam&quot; them, often for the purpose of a temporary dictatorship over the rules or an unintended win, is considered a valid way to play.  Other players like to write a lot of proposals, while some may be more interested in whatever non-meta gameplay mechanics are in place at the time (currently not all that much).<p>There&#x27;s no obligation to read the whole ruleset (or any of it) before joining - it&#x27;s only so big because of that tendency to explicitly define things, but most of those things aren&#x27;t really surprising, or you can look them up as needed.<p>Basically to join you should subscribe to the three &#x27;main&#x27; mailing lists linked from the homepage (agora-business, agora-official, agora-discussion - I really need to add a way to subscribe to them all at once or otherwise merge them, but for now you have to do it individually) and send a message to agora-business saying you want to become a player.",1439510206

It&#x27;s a UX thing more than a bug, although there was two cases where &quot;docker-compose up&quot; destroyed and rebuilt a volume-only container that was in the docker-compose.yml -- unfortunately it was difficult to replicate so we didn&#x27;t send a bug report through. The big thing is that using it on OSX with boot2docker means the cache can get confused, and so to get it to pick up config file changes (say, changes to an nginx config that are brought into the container) or some Dockerfile changes requires a &quot;docker-compose rm && docker-compose build --no-cache&quot;, which of course will delete the volume-only container unless you&#x27;re aware enough of the need to name the container you want to rebuild; as I said, it&#x27;s more a UX issue than a bug, in my opinion.<p>In terms of fixes, ideally I&#x27;d like to see a way of marking a container as &quot;volume-only&quot; -- this would then mean a &quot;docker-compose rm&quot; would not remove it, and &quot;docker-compose up&quot; would never rebuild it.",1439509638

10057835,comment,10056038,10057593,0,0,tikhonj,,,"A monoid is a type where we know how to combine two elements together. There are two parts: a function that combines and an identity for it. (The function is usually written as an infix operator to make it easier to read.)<p>For example, we can combine two integers by adding (+) with 0 as an identity. Or we could combine them by (*) with 1 as an identity.<p>Lists are a monoid because we can append two lists and the empty list is the identity.<p>The combining operator has to be associative and the identity has to be an identity for it. (Combining something with the identity gives you that original thing back.)<p>And that&#x27;s all. There&#x27;s just not much structure to them. In fact, there&#x27;s so little structure that mathematicians don&#x27;t care much about them. It&#x27;s an exotic-sounding name for a fairly pedestrian concept.<p>But they&#x27;re useful in programming. The main reason is that they&#x27;re so ubiquitous: so many different things form monoids, often in different ways. This means we have a single interface applicable to almost every domain you can think of which is useful even if the interface doesn&#x27;t tell us much.<p>They&#x27;re also a good fit for parallelism. Because the combining function is associative, we can a bunch of combinations in any order we like, making it easy to spread them out over multiple threads. It very naturally captures the reduce in map reduce.<p>But mostly it&#x27;s a convenient abstraction that&#x27;s minimal and simple enough to pop up everywhere while still being useful.",1439509027

I&#x27;m not sure I understand the purpose of the &quot;afterRead&quot; hook and how it would help with this use case.<p>- &quot;If it is the case that afterSave does not block a save, then the documentation is pretty poor around this. My understanding is that afterSave and beforeSave are both required to complete before you&#x27;ll get a return value from saving an object. If this is not the case, I suggest making this clearer in the docs.&quot;<p>I was wrong earlier. A client will not get a response until an afterSave completes execution. What I should have pointed out is that ongoing http requests to external endpoints will <i>not</i> block the afterSave from returning. As such, you can still use Mailchimp in this case without worrying that a client will be blocked. Of course, you will want to avoid blocking the afterSave on the third party network request (e.g. adding on to the promise chain), which should not be a problem if this is truly a fire-and-forget operation.<p>- &quot;At the point where you are using Webhooks like this, the advantages of Parse disappear entirely.&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re not giving the client-side SDKs enough credit here. Server side business logic is only one part of the equation. With Parse, you also get a data browser, analytics, push notifications, and probably most important of all, a database.<p>- &quot;It&#x27;s not cloning a DB that&#x27;s the problem -- it&#x27;s programatically updating schema so that I can deploy schema changes to my staging environment and then deploy the matching set of schema changes to prod environment, automatically. This is not possible without a bunch of scripting. And, obviously, there is no easy way to mass-migrate parse objects to a new schema either.&quot;<p>This feedback seems contrary to your earlier ask for a way to script Config variable updates. :) There&#x27;s the Data Browser for UI based manipulation, there&#x27;s a Schema API for programmatic manipulation, and there&#x27;s a dedicated schema migration setting. You can use any of these approaches as needed, and depending on how much scripting you wish to do.<p>- &quot;This needs to be better documented. Google searches bring up results where people are constructing pointers via JSON and this was indicated to be &quot;the right way to do things&quot;&quot;<p>Adding Parse objects to pointer fields is documented in all of the guides. createWithoutData is an alternate constructor that can be useful when creating pointers explicitly, but it&#x27;s not the only way of creating a pointer. The link I posted is straight from the API Reference docs.<p>- &quot;If I want to mass-import data into my system, I&#x27;m at the mercy of system timestamps. There are no options to fix this.&quot;<p>These two fields, as well as the object id, can be set to arbitrary values as part of a JSON import.

Either way, I don&#x27;t think defective software has anything to do with it.</i><p>That seems where we disagree.<p>With other kinds of product I buy, at least in my country, there are consumer protection laws about the being of sufficient quality and fit for their intended purpose. If a product doesn&#x27;t live up to those standards, I am entitled <i>by law</i> to have the situation put right or compensated one way or another, for example through repair, replacement, or ultimately a refund of some or all of the money I paid to buy the product. If a product is so bad that it causes other harm as well then in some cases I would also have grounds for further compensation. (The situation is also somewhat different when selling to businesses vs. private individual in my country, so I&#x27;m oversimplifying here.)<p>With software, developers have historically been given a lot of slack, in part because none of us know how to write bug-free programs so expecting everyone to achieve that standard before being able to sell anything is unhelpful. However, the same basic legal principles do still apply, and they have sometimes been used in practice. Part of the reason that big software developers like Microsoft don&#x27;t fall foul of those rules more often and wind up paying back a lot more in refunds and/or other compensation is that they do make reasonable efforts to fix defects in their software for a reasonable time after purchase.<p>My point is that providing a reasonable degree of support is not really optional for them and they are not really being generous in providing it. If they stopped doing so, and their customers then started suffering real damage because of bugs or vulnerabilities in Windows, then Microsoft would risk being sued until either they fixed the problems or their business failed.<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with any other kind of update. Microsoft has, to my knowledge, no obligation after a customer has already purchased their copy of Windows to provide ongoing development of new features, drivers for other vendors&#x27; hardware, or their UI. They might choose to do that, and they might choose to offer those things to customers in return for money, data, or any other agreed form of compensation.<p>But whether or not they do that, it doesn&#x27;t change the basic obligation they do have to provide a decent product if they&#x27;re charging real money for it, and to make reasonable efforts to fix defects or compensate for them if their original product is flawed. The customer is entitled to get what they paid for, not a broken version of what they paid for, and not a version where a defect was fixed but some other unwanted change was also made so it&#x27;s still not what the customer was originally supposed to be buying.<p><i>A quick google....</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how much credibility I&#x27;d give reviews from that kind of source. Of course they look favourable, because they seem to make little effort to be at all critical of anything and almost completely gloss over the widely reported problems and backward steps in favour of... ooooh, shiny!<p>For example, several of them highlight robustness as a big point in favour of Windows 10. Given the huge amount of negative comments from people who were in the beta/preview programme and the multiple, widespread, system-breaking forced updates that have already been pushed out within just a few days of launch, I don&#x27;t see how any unbiased review could possibly conclude that stability is a strong point for Windows 10 so far, and I see no basis for the blind faith several reviewers seem to have that Microsoft will fix the fundamental risk of bad updates bricking boxes. Few of the reviews make a big deal of removed features like Media Center, or hardware incompatibilities with older devices, which are the kinds of issues that won&#x27;t trouble the majority of users but will be very bad for those who are affected. I don&#x27;t see much mention there of clunky search tools or the confusing division of what used to be in the control panel into multiple areas. None of the reviews that I looked at even mentioned things like privacy concerns, or spamming ads at you unless you pay subscription money to turn them off, or the WiFi Sense security concerns.<p>Try Googling a few other relevant terms, like say &quot;Windows 10 laptop reboot loop&quot; or &quot;Windows 10 WiFi Sense security&quot; or &quot;Windows 10 search&quot;, and see how overwhelmingly positive the commentary looks then.",1439508134

I still don&#x27;t see how &quot;svc -u&quot; is more complicated than &quot;systemctl start&quot;, though.<p>That said, I would definitely not characterize systemd as &quot;just works&quot;. Besides the issues that come with its intertwining system state, service state, process management, process supervision, configuration parsing and so on all in one critical process, the unit file mechanism is significantly less expressive than the chain loading mechanism (which really shines when used with a small dedicated lexer for run scripts like execline). You are limited within the bounds of the INI key pairs and you have no way to compose them, because they&#x27;re just fixed entries in a hash table that systemd sets up at build time to look up.<p>The dependency mechanism is a quagmire of its own, with it mixing up semantics between ordering and dependence while limiting the service relationship types to whatever the systemd toolkit gives you. It introduces the problem of dependency loops which barely give you any debugging context when they occur, and it requires that systemd maintain complicated internal job and transaction consistency checking for a dependency system which will fundamentally always remain incomplete, because dependencies with respect to processes work entirely different compared to dependencies in libraries where you have fixed expectations of public symbols, relocated and resolved by the dynamic loader.<p>It feels like systemd, in the part where it&#x27;s best at - service management, isn&#x27;t ambitious <i>enough</i>. Instead it has decided to be a sprawling middleware doing 100 things and none of them completely, in an attempt to be a standard userland you just theoretically plug in between GNU and Linux and get a distro. In practice, the integration work required to maintain a systemd-compliant runtime and keep up with the rapid chaotic pace of development is not any less difficult than maintaining poorly written SysV initscripts.",1439507669

I hope you guys won&#x27;t me talking about a statically typed language here, but it should be on topic to string interpolation at least.<p><pre><code>    //interpolation\n    print(&quot;My name is &quot;, name, &quot; and next year, I will be &quot;, age + 1, &quot; years old.\n&quot;);\n    \n    //arguments\n    print(&quot;My name is {0}, and next year, I will be {1} years old.\n&quot;, name, age + 1);\n    \n    //arguments with hinting (:label is ignored)\n    print(&quot;My name is {0:name}, and next year, I will be {1:age} years old.&quot;\n&quot;, fetch(), *values + 1);\n    \n    print(hex(size, 4), &quot; KiB&quot;);  //interpolation formatting\n    print(&quot;{0,4x} KiB&quot;, size);    //argument formatting (more covenient, but more cryptic and limited)\n    \n    //without the print component:\n    string s{&quot;My name is: &quot;, name, &quot;\n&quot;};  //interpolation\n    string s{&quot;My name is: {0}\n&quot;, name};   //arguments\n</code></pre>\nThe latter is certainly vastly superior for localization. Because in another language, it may be more grammatically correct to reverse the parameters, eg: &quot;来年の歳は{1}と名前は{0}&quot;; which is something C printf doesn&#x27;t support, shy of unofficial extensions for argument reordering.<p>But I find that as the string gets longer and longer, the former is much more readable. (You&#x27;ll have to imagine the syntax highlighting, which helps a lot.) Eg when you have 17 arguments, it can be annoying to count to find the 11th parameter, whereas with interpolation, it&#x27;s right there where it&#x27;s used.<p>Ultimately, I decided on the former being the default, and added a format class for the latter, which is also really handy for building your argument lists somewhere else. Plus the default won&#x27;t clobber your escape characters (in my case, braces.)<p><pre><code>    //inline format\n    print(&quot;I am {0}, and I&#x27;m {1} years old.\n&quot;, format{name, age});\n    \n    //external format\n    format f;\n    f.append(fetch());      //person&#x27;s age\n    f.append(*values + 1);  //person&#x27;s name\n    ...  //you could fetch the string from a translation table below, too\n    print(&quot;I am {0}, and I&#x27;m almost {1} years old.\n&quot;, f);\n</code></pre>\nWhenever string::append(format) is invoked, it will use all of the values inside the format array to parse {#} entries in the string. Of course, it&#x27;s also safe and will simply skip over a reference to {2} in a format array with only one value.<p>Curious to hear others&#x27; opinions on the above, and any suggestions for improvement.",1439507108

So if demand exceeds supply then prices rise to a high % of income.  This is why I don&#x27;t believe in minimum wage increases in HCOL urban areas.  Real estate prices just rise to adjust.  One way to hack the system is to have LCOL in a HCOL area, like living in a van in SF.  But few people have the fortitude (or whatever) to do this.",1439506970

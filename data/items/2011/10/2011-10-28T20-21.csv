The display is plugged into the wall and then there is just one cable that has data/video and power for the external processing unit.  When it's time to upgrade the processing unit you just unplug a single cable and swap it out.  The display part would be expected to last through at least a couple upgrades of the processing unit.",1319835549

Native Americans have suffered through hundreds of years of genocide (by action or neglect) and laws meant to remove all culture and rights.  Heck, lookup Pres.

Earlier this month, Foundry Group VC Seth Levine said he felt ""surprised"" being pitched by a group of guys in their late 40s and 50s (<a href=""http://www.sethlevine.com/wp/2011/10/is-there-age-bias-in-vc-investing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sethlevine.com/wp/2011/10/is-there-age-bias-in-vc...</a>). Hank described the Sequoia VC saying that they're biased toward younger people.<p>These types of biases come from people who have established patterns of personality traits and other characteristics of what makes for a successful startup and who they like to deal with. I would further posit that they have established norms for dealing with such people (including building networks which support such connections) which makes it easier for both parties to move the relationship forward.<p>If, however, a startup founder doesn't fit the molds of age, ethnicity, education, background, or whatever, his or her chances of being taken seriously and/or accomplishing something together are much less.",1319835355

See, that marketing-babble works even for Microsoft and Oracle too.<p>Google's goal is to get as much diverse data from you as possible and legal. Stop cutting a multi-billion dollar multi-national mega-corp all that slack all the time - especially considering how much flak they were and are getting: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google</a><p>And on top of that they were pretty much the only search engine for the web for a long time, so much so that ""google"" has become synonymous with internet for the average user. At least now there is a bit of competition from wolfram and microsoft and DDG is trying real hard. But google is clearly dominating this market and also the online ads business. Apple can only dream of coming close to this amount of market penetration.<p>> <i>No I haven't because I made it clear that first and foremost I want _personal control_ over my own computer. I don't see why you don't understand this principle.</i><p>Because control of your computer includes control over your data. And you were saying you can allegedly NOT use any proprietary systems because of your work but then it is ok to use completely proprietary services way out of your control? Well look at that, actually it is just your own personal preferences which makes more sense since if you were really legally required, you couldn't use google or any other cloud services.<p>> <i>Getting the tyrants at Apple</i><p>Again, you are mis-using words. Tyranny means they are alone and have all the control and are enforcing it brutally... this is complete, utter bullshit. There are lots of alternatives and on top of that, all this DRM and control for the music was a requirement from the RIAA. They did not understand this new way of selling music online and wanted as much control as possible. And since Apple made that compromise, they were the first ones to provide a legal and usable way of selling music online. And by doing this, they have shown how successful this way of distributing is thus finally they were allowed to drop the DRM. Do you really think Apple cares about controlling whether you distribute your music to 2 or 5 end systems? Then you are even more naive than I have thought.<p>> <i>It is pretty convenient for them to use (steal?) source code from BSD</i><p>Waaaaaait a minute, back up. Drop the fundamentalist brain-wash bullshit-talk. BSD has always been released under the BSD license and there are many, many, MANY implementations and re-uses of their code, both open and closed, private, educational and commercial and not a single one has been ""stolen"".<p>It is perfectly legal and encouraged to use the code any way you want and why should Apple go with other sources that ultimately force them to do things hardly any company does with profitable products? Anyone who ever contributed to BSD licensed software is aware of this and it has worked perfectly fine for decades. Nothing was stolen here. It is perfectly alright for a company to choose whichever software and license agreement they see fit. And there is hardly any commercial software released under the ""viral"" FSF licenses. And Apple has released a lot of components from their OS, again under a BSD style license. Nothing to see here.<p>> <i>it won't be ""good enough"" until they adopt a business model that is not based upon dominating other people's computers.</i><p>See, here is the point: that is your borderline-religious opinion. Nobody really cares about this. if you don't like their product because it is not as open as you like then don't buy it. And if you don't like the price on a Lexus or Ferrari then don't buy one. Nothing to see here.<p>You have clearly made up your mind and are not interested in a discussion. You much rather poo-fling the one or two (out-dated) bits you can get a hold of. And it has got nothing to do with how the overwhelming majority of successful software and hardware companies work. Some are very open, some are completely closed. Luckily there are a lot of alternatives for everything. But your zealot-hatred for Apple is just hilarious considering how 5 to 10 years ago hardly ANYONE knew Apple let alone used any of their products and back in those dark ages there was nothing but Microsoft for the average end user. Apple has come a long way on their own and they have single-handedly created markets that did NOT exist before - like legally buying music and tv shows online. Like the iPad and like the iPhone. Yes there were those ridiculous windows ce ""smartphones"" before but Apple created the market for the modern smartphone and the oh-so-beloved ""apps"". And google was all too happy to follow, seeing the opportunity for more data and ads.<p>Any data I feed my mac, I can always export and take with me to any other platform... there is absolutely no DRM on my Mac keeping me from doing whatever I want.<p>Your demeanor is really cute and very much like the blind fanboys in the huge Linux vs. Windows flamewars back in the day... the 90s called, they want their zealots back.<p>And I dare you, you show me a single contribution you have ever made to Linux?

3169908,story,,,8,13,grkballer44,"Thanks PG, applying to Y Combinator cost me a shot at my local startupfund",,"After being turned down by a local startup fund in Canton, OH (which is being ran by a statewide accelerator program) I enjoyed the spirited 45 minute conversation I was having with the investment analyst  who was in charge of turning down my application, and listening to his reasoning on why I was not even eligible to EVEN PITCH my concept to the local commission who decides who receives funding . 
Let me set the table for the story, I applied to the fund  September 30, and was contacted by the analyst (who shall remain nameless),  after having a brief talk about my idea, he told me to send in an executive statement. During this conversation I also told him I was applying to Ycombinator (which turned out to be a mistake lol).  I had never made an executive statement b4, and after just finishing up my ycombinator application, I couldnt help but feel an executive statement for an early stage tech start up is a  huge waste of time. But I still spent much more time then I could afford (law school full time/ as well as developing a company), because the $25,000 the fund was offering would be a welcome addition to our start ups financial situation (besides being funded solely by a poor graduate student). 3 weeks after sending the executive statement in as well as a follow up email trying to verify he had received my message, I had yet to receive any sort of reply. So I contacted the accelerators offices, and eventually was able to get in touch with the financial analyst over the phone.
After not initially remembering who I was, and having to check to make sure he had recieved my emails (he did), and after briefly visiting my beta for the first time, he told me that my website was not at a point where it was elible to recieve funding. My idea failed for several reasons, which I would like to discuss more fully below.<p>1. I applied to Ycombinator- part of the start up funds conditioning on recieving investment is that the company must stay in Canton, OH for the next 10 years. My application to Ycombinator 3 month program showed that I wasn't dedicated to staying in the area, and was a major part of his reasoning on passing on  my application to pitching to the start up commission.  I found this entertaining on several levels, and apparently my points listed below couldn't convince him. 
        1. There aren't a lot of people who would question my dedication to my hometown. I have lived here my entire life, including while finishing my under grad degree at Mount Union University,  and while pursuing my Law degree at The University of Akron, not to mention locating my start up here.
        2.  The odds of getting accepted to Ycombinator are between 1-3%, horrible odds no matter how you look at it, I'd consider anyone applying who places their start ups future on getting accepted a pipe dream. So I didn't, after my application I continued building my company and working on my product, business as usual. So I find it funny that a potential investor would take my APPLICATION to a program he knows to be a long shot,  as a definitive signs that I would leave the area.  If accepted to Ycombinator it would be a tough decision for me to make on whether or not I should relocate to the Valley full time, but this is a road I haven't crossed yet, and I'd appreciate if someone who understand the ycombinator process (he knew about the program, the analyst is originally from The Valley) would be able to understand this, and at the very least not throw my application to his program out the window just because I applied to another potential fund.<p>2. Uniqueness- according to him my idea wasnt unique enough. After outlining several ways in which my product was unique from the competition, and outlining areas where I believed our start up had a significant advantage. His reply was, whats to prevent one of you major competitors  in the social media field from adopting your idea, and at this point I knew he had no idea what he was talking about. If my idea is unique enough to where major competitors in the field would try to adopt it, then I suppose its at the very least unique, and potentially a market that my competitors would be interested in acquiring us or by competing with us.<p>3. lack of market validation- according to him my company wasnt suitable for the start up fund because it lacked validation, after all when he visited my beta for the first time I only had 4 members  who have joined the site. I explained to him that currently my start up is in stealth mode, and the ""members"" accounts are there simply for testing. He couldnt understand the concept on why a start up would want to remain in stealth mode(or at least how his fund couldnt invest in a company still in stealth mode), and without market validation they couldnt tell if the idea whether the market would accept it.  He couldnt distinguish between a startup that had launched, and one that was simply an idea, prefering to place my site in the latter merely because of a lack of market validation.   At this point I began to get slightly agitated. If you work for a start up fund, and are unable to invest in ideas that have yet to been released, or had significant market validation, good luck. Good investors/entrepreneurs  are able to make a living because they don't need market validation everytime they evaluate concept,  if they did they would have much more difficult time making money, because by the time the market has been validated its either to late or much more difficult to enter it, the competition being more formidable.<p>There's a reason the valley has had a stranglehold on the tech innovation that has been changing the world. Its because outside of the valley, this is the shit the future entrepreneurs deal with on an every day basis.",1319833171

Without fail, they pick the most impressive numbers to present, not the most reflective of ""business success"" (which, admittedly, can't always be directly related to sales figures, but you can usually do better than ""overall page views month over month""). This isn't their fault - it's the sort of stuff mid-level brand managers want to take to the CMO to say, ""See, it's working! Please increase my budget."" And the CMO doesn't mind much, either, because he can go to the board and say, ""See, it's working! Please increase my budget."" And the board likes to leave their meetings happy, so they generally don't mind good news... except when that good news doesn't match what the CFO is presenting for their revenue.<p>Measuring the wrong thing is endemic to technologists because we have the opportunity to measure everything! Drucker once said, ""what gets measured gets managed."" That couldn't be more true.

If you can't put a dollar value on an action (10% of pageviews turn to signups, 25% of signups become active users, 60% of active users become paying members, paying members are worth X, therefore a pageview is worth Y), it might not be worth measuring.<p>Quasi-apropos: what makes Facebook so impressive to me is not that it reaches 51% of Internet users, but that the average one views over 1,000 pages a month[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/adplanner/static/top1000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/adplanner/static/top1000/</a>",1319832412

The terminology is very unfortunate, though, especially if you're outside the culture it originated in.<p>I think the idea they want to convey could be more inclusively expressed as ""We believe in being happy and having a life and interests outside of programming"" or something like that.",1319832363

Touchscreens (especially ones with menus) are impossible to navigate without taking your eyes off the road.  In my old Toyota Echo I could find <i>every</i> control (and its state) by feel alone.<p>Now, if they added tactile feedback to the touchscreen (say vibrations as you moved over controls on the screen, and requiring force to ""click"") and got rid of menus, at least that'd be usable (if not still silly).<p>...That said I'd still buy the car if I had that kind of disposable income.",1319832173

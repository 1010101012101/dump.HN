1742977,comment,1742468,1742468,0,0,DisposaBoy,,,"Just in-case anyone have not seen the system come into use on Facebook. It's like an automated waring system(prolly is fully automatic). First it warns about adding so may people so quickly, it only kicks i if you're adding what appears to be complete strangers. So if you're adding a lot of people and they are mostly a friends-of-existing-friends type of deal or they have something i common like they are in the same school/year/grade network then it not as aggressive. Upon each(yes there are multiple if you keep it up) warning, it states clearly what will happen if you adding people that quickly. IIRC it even says the reason for the warning is that you're adding people too quickly and you should slow down. The next stage is to stop you adding people for a short while, it tells you about this and that you could be banned if you it up. If you stop adding people for say a day or two you slowly regain your ability to add people, if you're well behaved for a while you can start adding strangers again, but for many you will be notified that you can't add them because the system doesn't think you actually know them.<p>To sum up, if you get banned for adding too many friends too quickly regardless of whether or not you were spamming, i.e adding real friends then you're an idiot. Also, throwing a bitch-fit about how you left before you could get banned is silly, all it does is draw attention to you for being one of the people that are ruining Facebook for people who use it. For the record, I log on to Facebook approximately 15 minutes every couple months on average but I still find it annoying when people add you when the have no intention of being your friend.",1285847924

1742955,comment,1742049,1742324,0,0,retube,,,"At 35,000mph would take 402,000 years. Inter-stellar travel is not for the feint-hearted. It's probably possible to accelerate a space-craft to around 10x this speed using current motor technology. Even so, that's still 40,000 years - and 21 light years is like a nano-meter away on a galactic or cosmological scale.<p>Really, if you want to cross inter-stellar space in any kind of reasonable time - O(human lifetime) - you need to go faster. Possible solutions are: solar sail or new kinds of ion thruster. Both of these impart a very small force (and hence acceleration) for an exceedingly long time, resulting in very high velocities. Your target speed is about 10% of c. In the case of the solar sail it receives momentum from sun for ~ 50% of distance (assuming similar-sized star to our sun), and then is braked by the momentum from the target star for the rest of the journey.<p>Problem with solar sail is it needs to be GIGANTIC, and composed of materials stronger and lighter than those available today. Additionally force from sunlight is proportional to 1/r^2 so your acceleration decreases with distance.<p>So, nuclear powered ion thruster is probably the answer. But, obviously, this kind of project is expensive. And either way, you need living quarters for an entire society to live and reproduce.",1285847297

Check the kindle forums below for additional detail.<p>pictures must be in a folder right under the /pictures folder that you have to manually create. you can't put them in the pictures folder or in a subfolder of a subfolder. you can have multiple groups of pictures by having them in different subfolders of /pictures folder, but that ends up cluttering up your menu, if you like having only a few things in it at a time.<p>mp3s can go into audible or music folder (have to manually create music).<p>mp3s in audible show up like books. mp3s in music can be played while browsing, reading, etc. via experimental in home menu.<p>PDFs can load slow as hell, and are a pain to have to resize (basically, they are not usable unless you have a big font in the PDF). Instead try to get free books from Amazon or in mobi format, which is the un-DRM'd version of the format Amazon uses for their books (AZW). Mobi format is available from Gutenberg as the what it calls the Kindle format.<p>Don't load up your Kindle with a ton of crap books because it is a pain in the butt to find the one you want. Unless absolutely necessary, you are probably better off keeping a small collection in it.<p>Pictures are in b/w so darker pictures are just usable, and this is just a ""neat"" feature, not likely to be used much. It might be neat for storing clear customized b/w blueprints, wireframe designs, simple electronic circuit design, simple workflows, etc. It is also kind of hard to resize so it makes good use of the screen (600px × 800px) but then you really want many rotated to look good right off the bat.<p>The browser sucks because it is buggy and because you can't zoom or click easily with the included controls. Buy a Kindle to read, not browse Facebook or type email. Once the Kindle has touch screen and pinch zoom and color, then the browser will be ok. No I'm not suggesting an iPad. They are too reflective in the sun and they aren't meant for reading, and they are overkill for an e-reader.<p>For the scoop on Kindles from a good broad section of its (not always super-technical) users that Amazon watches is here:<p><a href=""http://www.kindleboards.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kindleboards.com/</a>",1285846846

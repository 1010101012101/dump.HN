Im a college student/ biz dev guy and Im going by myself and I dont really have a good pitch. I was wondering if you could critique this pitch:<p>I came across this start up idea when I was diagnosed with Gilberts Syndrome in August. I lost a decent amount of weight from having stomach issues which was unfortunate because I play in an amateur football league during the summers.  I realized gaining muscle was as hard as losing weight, because a strict diet is more important than working out.  Id like to build something like Weight Watchers for weight gainers. Assign points to certain foods that have high protein and carbohydrates and have custom diets for customers.  I think the biggest issue for putting on weight for people who were sick or need to bulk up for a sports team isnt working out but what to eat and how much of it to consume. This tool would solve this problem.  I need a developer and a designer.<p>What do you think?",1320381908

But to write an article using wordplay as the basic tool for explaining anything other than wordplay is worse than being offensive. You run the risk of alienating a lot of English-as-second-language folks for a start, as they lack a lot of the fluency required. But even further, I've learned heavily and repeatedly that there are considerable differences between what many American English and British English speakers can take from talking in metaphor. British English speakers (and the British themselves, in particular) live and breathe metaphor.<p>I find that most people who can't understand speaking in metaphor are either English-second-language; American English speakers; or Brit English speakers who have dropped out of education early and have very little socialisation.<p>It's not to say there aren't American English folks who don't understand metaphor well, it's just that it's so common for them to misunderstand it.

3194955,comment,3194836,3194921,3,0,kylewpppd,,,"This is anecdotal evidence from them coming to speak at my college, but... Walmart controls almost all of it's logistics. Whereas its competitors use other shipping companies, and have inventory sit in 3rd party warehouses, Walmart builds huge distribution centers that service multiple Walmart stores.<p>The distribution centers mean they can purchase huge levels of inventory at discounted terms. Running their own logistics means that they can break up pallets into smaller shipments appropriate for each store. So stores need less space to carry inventory, and they can purchase and store huge amounts at lower cost per sq. ft.<p>The other thing the logistics does is gives them an advantage in transportation cost. Although (I've heard) the margins in ground transport are slim, running your own ground transport saves money, allowing for lower prices to the consumer.<p>Walmart's size also contributes to their ""efficiency"". They can buy in larger quantities than their competitors and try to exert downward pressure on suppliers' prices. They can also nab exclusives and put them on the shelves for less than competitors.",1320381628

Saying ""please"", vacuous as it might be, communicates consideration.  Profanity communicates the opposite.<p>Of course, it isn't that simple; language is language and context is everything.  Sometimes someone swearing at you means, ""Some people would be offended by this, but I know you can take it.""  The inconsiderate language is a compliment.  Sometimes it means, ""We don't have time for social niceties; this is important.""  It's like pounding your fist on a table or slamming a door.  But by itself, the meaning is closer to, ""I don't care about you, because I just don't.""<p>Profanity can certainly be used <i>well</i>, but without a redeeming purpose the vibe is somewhere between stupidity and rudeness.  I find that offensive.  Not as in, ""I'm wounded"", but as in, ""that's unpleasant.""<p>Some of it's cultural, too.  One family may be big on courtesy -- always saying, ""please pass the butter"" at dinner.  Just reaching across the table at that house would give a lot of offense because it violates how they show consideration to each other.  In another house, everyone may just reach for everything all the time, and it doesn't mean anything.<p>Profanity is a lot like that.  In some crowds, <i>any</i> uncensored profanity is highly offensive, a nine out of ten.  In others, vocabulary alone can't push the needle past two, and you need to start in with creative graphic descriptions if you really mean to offend.<p>People have a couple of different reactions to that.<p>Some people, particularly the folks with a high pain threshold, just assume their culture is better.  They swear a lot and the subtext is, ""I don't care if you're offended because I think your culture sucks anyway.""  Hardly polite.<p>Other folks try to speak the language of the crowd they're in.  If you say ""X is sh*t"" to a mixed group, some will hear ""X is stinky socks"" while others will hear ""X is bestiality and I hate you.""  If you're pretty sure where on the spectrum your crowd falls, you can go ahead and use the expression.  If it's mixed, though, you had best go ahead and use whichever of the two phrases it is you actually mean.",1320380987

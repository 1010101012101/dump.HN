There is definitely some overlap, but I think it&#x27;s nice to have the mindset that they are on the external developers&#x27; side rather than just the company&#x27;s side. And it works well I think - by helping out those developers, they can work towards better products and platforms, and increase adoption at the same time. Everyone wins.",1404179924

You may consider it unlikely, but there are some known potential causes[1].<p>As I understand it, Stagflation happens when increased demand is less able to stimulate increased supply than one might expect.<p>As mentioned in [1], an oil supply shock could be a cause. That is not outlandish given the current instability in the middle east and our tense relationship with other oil producers (Russia and Venezuela). The US and Canada do produce a lot of oil, which may offer insulation, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily a defense.<p>Another cause listed is tough regulatory atmosphere. For instance, if the EPA decides to strongly curb CO2 emissions, or misguided labor laws come into effect, or the healthcare system in the US gets even worse.

The route home might be different each time, but you&#x27;ll always get an indication of ETA. Part of the hassle of catching a bus is the last mile and the wait. If a vehicle is arriving shortly after you hail it (or prebook it) and right at your location, those two factors are eliminated.<p>For the privacy factor, I think people will just get used to it as they have with current public transport, or tiers will be in operation (as you suggested) or someone will inevitably design a pod-based vehicle with seats facing port and starboard and a clever door system.<p>I do wonder if people will be uncomfortable with other passengers knowing exactly where they live and work?

The minute Pichai took over I had the feeling that Android&#x27;s future was limited - they would keep investing in it for sure but it would be on a long term road map for convergence and eventual transition to ChromeOS. I expected to first see Chrome apps running as first class citizens on Android, then a new SDK for Android that was all about ChromeOS and then finally a deprecating of the Java SDK. It always felt to me like internally Google preferred ChromeOS and the web as a platform and Android was a sort of accidental success that they were just running with until they could somehow meld it into their pure vision of computing, as represented by ChromeOS.<p>So now I&#x27;m having to significantly revisit all that thinking, as if anything Google seems to be pushing Android everywhere and little was said about ChromeOS.",1404178934

7968743,comment,7968596,7968596,43,0,timothya,,,"One of the things that I&#x27;ve always seen as an interesting difference between how Google and Apple run their developer relations teams is the title that they give their employees. Apple has <i>Technology Evangelists</i>, suggesting that they promote the use of certain technologies (typically Apple&#x27;s own technology or Apple-supported web technology). Google, on the other hand, has <i>Developer Advocates</i> - these are people who actually represent non-Googler developers internally at Google.<p>While they may just be titles, my experience has been consistent with their titles. Apple representatives you see once a year at WWDC, while Google representatives you see at Google I/O and also at a number of Google-hosted events year-round, including the regular videos they put out (and the &quot;office-hours&quot; type Hangouts they have so that you can actually talk to them and get your problems resolved) - just look at all of the events they have scheduled on the Google Developer Events page[0] or all of the videos they have on their YouTube channel[1]. I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of them give talks at tech conferences, while Apple employees are rarely seen at conferences. And you can see that Google&#x27;s Developer Advocates really do talk directly to the actual teams directly and file bugs against them when necessary on behalf of developers everywhere. It&#x27;s a system that has worked pretty well in my experience.<p>I will also agree that Google&#x27;s Developer Advocates don&#x27;t care too much about what platform you&#x27;re using and just want to help you. I&#x27;ve been to a number of Google-run technical workshops and codelabs, and the people there are willing to help you with whatever problems you run into, no matter what it is.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/events/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/events/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers</a>",1404178362

This was before the web took off so you couldn&#x27;t just Google for a Stackoverflow answer when you got stuck!<p>Duke Nukem 3D and the Build engine were pretty interesting for level creation.

You might not have hit it - yet - but you will).<p>The internet - as you are aware - is based on protocols not designed with any significant security in mind.  No-one in their right mind would today sit down and design something like BGP, for example.  With that in mind, any large provider (or large consumer with capability to cause harm) has the responsibility to be a good citizen of the internet, and not to (by action or inaction) advance the agendas of those who would see its demise.  As much as it might be convenient from an operational POV, and justifiable from a moral POV, washing your hands of responsibility  and saying &quot;It&#x27;s not up to us, it&#x27;s up to the courts&quot; just doesn&#x27;t work when the infrastrucure we&#x27;re all building on is so very fragile.\nI&#x27;d also like to note that there&#x27;s a semi-hidden US bias here - what if the target of a botnet, who&#x27;s admin interface is hosted by CF - is based in a country where there is no reasonable ability to recourse to the US courts?  Iran, for example?<p>It&#x27;s admirable that you do not censor content in response to political pressure, but there <i>IS</i> a difference between protecting freedom of speech and protecting malware, and saying that censoring the malware is a slippery slope is at least partly disingenuous - any vaguely controversial decision can be described as a slippery slope to something else.\nPlease at least consider making it easier for those of us who are trying to fight malware, botnets, etc, etc to get the original source of the content.

1061373,comment,1056971,1061226,0,0,mhartl,,,"Ah, so we don't really disagree at all---or, at least not much. It's my fault for using a bad analogy, and you hit on a better one. You're right, the axioms, whether in economics or physics, must come from the empirical world. Given the axioms, you can then prove theorems, but of course the axioms might need tweaking---which can dramatically change the theorems. What I see in economics are cases where people implicitly accept particular axioms, and yet reject many of the consequences (i.e., theorems). It's as if they agree that Newton's law of gravitation is correct, but don't believe that two-body orbits are closed.<p>Though complex in general, there are aspects of human behavior that are consistent and quite simple, and serve as a solid foundation for a study of human action. (You probably recognize this as the Austrian approach of <i>praxeology</i>.) When I read the Austrian argument that any fixed amount of money-stuff (e.g., gold) is sufficient for exchange, I understand the axioms, follows the steps, and accept the conclusion. When I read the Keynesian arguments for the benefits of monetary expansion and ""fiscal stimulus"", I see---great clouds of fog. Their arguments are often too vague to untangle, but I can see that their conclusions (a) appear to be based on the same axioms I accept and (b) disagree with a theorem. Something doesn't add up.<p>In sum, the value of empiricism lies in finding the right axioms. If you discover ""empirical evidence"" that a theorem is wrong, you must either propose a change in the axioms or find a flaw in the proof. Contemporary economists often appear to do neither.<p>(The Card & Krueger example is again instructive. If you raise the price of labor, people buy less of it, so minimum wage hikes must increase unemployment.  And yet, from  a contemporary NY Times article (<a href=""http://bit.ly/5afSyk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/5afSyk</a>), we find this:<p><pre><code>    They [Card & Krueger] surveyed 400 fast food restaurants and found that\n    those in New Jersey actually added 2.5 workers after the minimum wage went\n    up. In Pennsylvania restaurants, meanwhile, payrolls shrank.\n\n    Why should bosses hire more workers if it's more expensive to do so? The\n    two economists speculate that any fast-food restaurant typically operates\n    with a couple of vacancies it can't fill because it doesn't pay enough.\n\n    ""If you raise the minimum a little,"" said Professor Card, ""teens who are\n    sitting [at] home go out looking for jobs."" \n</code></pre>\nApparently, these restaurant managers are too stupid to realize they're allowed to pay <i>above</i> the current minimum wage, thereby getting those lazy teens off their couches to fill the vacancies without a minimum wage hike. Truly, it boggles the mind.)",1263869983

That field has not evolved so much that ""Don't curse at your customers"" is bad advice in 2009.  However, if one of those were posted here, the first comment would likely be ""Dude, mark in the title this is from 2006"", because the audience here is socialized to assume that the new and shiny is what they want to be exposed to and the old and crusty is largely not valuable with the exception of a few classics.<p>I have sites where I have no visible dates for exactly that reason: I intend the content to be evergreen, and if it is evergreen you don't need to know what year it was planted.

In chess capturing a piece, defending a piece or simply making your position better by putting a bisshop on a diagonal can be seen as a step towards winning. Thus a chess AI doesn't need to go very deep before knowing which strategies are bad. For example, chess AI's written in JS often don't go much deeper than two steps ahead but still play quite decently.<p>But with Go you need to build chains made of several (often > 10) stones.

Show the pros a nonsense board that could never come up in real play, and the normal people do the same as they did before, but the pros crash and burn.

However, I doubt the OS will be available to manufacturers to use for their handsets.<p>That's the advantage of Android. Manufacturers can use it and have them negotiate with carriers.<p>With the IPhone, it cannot expand as fast as Android since Apple is the only one producing it and they need to work with every carrier. Whereas with Android, Google will not be doing any of these (or doesn't have to). The phone manufacturers will be doing it for them.",1263867023

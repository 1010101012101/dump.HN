It apparently saves a hardware id on their activation server. After that you can cleanly install Windows 10 and skip the key entry and it&#x27;ll activate based on that hardware id.<p>What could be done if you change the hardware ? If you had a retail key, then you&#x27;d probably need to install Windows 7/8 and upgrade to 10 again to repeat the hardware id registering process,  but I didn&#x27;t notice anywhere if this was tested.",1438174726

They do in fact own it, and, being a private business, they are in fact going to respond more to mob upsets and strong-arming than to any kind of liberal (in the classical sense) principle.<p>If you wanted some liberal principle, there&#x27;s an organization lying neglected in the corner whose charter says it more-or-less cannot censor anything under any circumstances.

9968267,comment,9967357,9967871,0,0,keenerd,,,"> There was similar post with ARM Chromebooks. A few years ago it was impossible to find stable ARMs which could sustain decent load without crashing. Company had to buy bunch of Chromebooks, strip batteries and put them into rack.<p>Well, no.  The guy putting that rack together didn&#x27;t know what he was doing and insisted on using the stock AC adapter for the devices.  You NEVER use the stock AC adapters in a cluster.  They are (usually) made to be cheap and not operate at full load.  Maybe 5% will fail under continuous full load.  Put 16 in a cluster and now you are looking at a 60% chance of a single failure.<p>ALWAYS ditch the bundled AC adapter and use a single, good quality, high power PSU that branches out to all the boards.  5 volts and 40 amps, for example.  These PSUs are more like 99.9% reliable, and as a bonus output much cleaner power.<p>The only reason that this guy had success with Chromebooks is because laptop PSUs are typically sized at 3x capacity (for battery charging).  Running a stock PSU 24x7 but only at 30% output greatly reduces the failure rate.<p>edit:<p><a href=""http://www.systemcall.eu/blog/2014/06/trashing-chromebooks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.systemcall.eu/blog/2014/06/trashing-chromebooks/</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7876235"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7876235</a><p>Besides ignoring the power supplies, the original author used SD cards on the HK boards instead of eMMC, which is another reliability no-no.  Though HK is pretty good about shipping quality PSUs with their hardware, so I suspect it was uSD being flaky in this guy&#x27;s case.",1438174521

It&#x27;s this kind of superiority complex that can&#x27;t see the forest from the trees to save its life. The forest is burning? Yes, but we passed brown 3 trees which means it shouldn&#x27;t be.

(<-- I doubt you recognize what this tone of voice is)<p>Who the fuck cares? Why are you debating if you should call someone an idiot or not? My personal philosophy is to be nice to others, always because I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re going through. What&#x27;s there to be gained by not only calling someone an idiot but defending it on the meta scale? Yes we should always cloak our rebuttals with negativity -- for what other way could there be?!

This is the latest version that we can use due to our billing system. We use WHMCS, so we need to go to V6 instead of our current V5. This is a large undertaking since we need to re-theme a complex theme.<p>- Openssl/OpenSSH is now up to date according to the CentOS repo, which has backported patches for exploits mentioned.

Besides, good-quality classical recordings are cheap and widely available in a wide variety of formats.<p>EDIT: My point was that perhaps the benefits of a good streaming service are lower to classical consumers (than pop music, which focuses more on unique individual performances).

Most classical music has a very wide dynamic range.   Your volume should be adjusted so that the very quietest parts are loud enough to hear every subtlety and so that the loudest parts shake your bones.<p>A single trumpet playing at full volume is loud enough to cause hearing damage.  An orchestra has several of them, along with 50+ other instruments.<p>Loud orchestras are loud enough that freaking cannons do not necessarily overpower them.<p>So next time you&#x27;re listening to classical music (or jazz), crank it up, and discover how much more you enjoy it.<p>Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll ruin streaming and radio, though.   They&#x27;re often compressed, ruining that huge dynamic range.   Each piece will have a different level, so you&#x27;ll constantly be playing with your volume knob to get it set correctly.   Which is really hard if you&#x27;ve never heard the piece before -- is it supposed to be loud or quiet?<p>And if you&#x27;re listening to the radio with the volume set correctly, the announcer will start screaming at you.   I love the CBC&#x27;s Julie Nesrallah&#x27;s voice, but I can&#x27;t listen to her program because they have her voice turned up way too loud.   If they turned it down the program would be much more enjoyable, and people would enjoy the music more because they&#x27;d turn their radio up to hear her properly.",1438173365

I know they have much work to do but it still feels like an operating system of many parts, all glued together.<p>Some issues I noticed in the preview I tried:
1. The underlying system hasn&#x27;t changed (still life in COM land with the joys/distresses of the registry and cryptic UUID keys where half of the configuration is secretly stored)
2. The icons in MMC don&#x27;t match anything else on the system (even the icons in Control Panel are not consistent - are they flat or should they have depth? Should they have no perspective or should they be set at a jaunty angle?)
3. Even the icons in Explorer don&#x27;t match each other (my user directory doesn&#x27;t match any of the icons beneath it)
4. The new Settings window is not resizable even though it is 50% white space
5. Control Panel is still there despite this new Settings window (duplication!)
6. Explorer permits you to show menus but they&#x27;re actually just the tabs on a frustrating ribbon bar
7. Notebook theme issues that were introduced in Windows XP still persist (Explorer&#x27;s Folder Options window has a white tab and border for the General page but the General page itself is grey; when you switch to the View and Search pages in this very same notebook those pages are white without a hint of grey; this General page is written without knowledge of theming..? plus none of the controls line up!)
8. There is still no consistent Open Dialog (Notepad uses a different Open dialog to MMC, for example; the MMC one is from about 1995, I was surprised there wasn&#x27;t a briefcase on it!)
9. There appears to be no HIG for menu placement in relation to toolbars (is the menu ABOVE the toolbar or below it?; control panel menu is below the toolbar, Explorer is above, Settings app doesn&#x27;t even have one), should true menubars be allowed (like in Notepad) or should they just be placeholders for ribbons (like in Explorer)?<p>It&#x27;s all just a big ball of different GUI styles and fashions from 25+ years of fashions, windowing toolkits (yes, you can find the MFC40 and 42 DLLs in the Windows directories in this, and yes .NET is there too, but the ancient Windows API will still work fine too, plus Win32!), user-interface guidelines from different decades and generally a mess.<p>I will wait to see how people rate it before installing.<p>EDIT: I notice downvotes but no responses?? I thought my points were valid - the mishmash of libraries from decades and decades with artwork from those decades makes for a convoluted jumbled experience. You wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable in a car that had a klaxon for the horn, a handbrake outside and a gear system with no synchromesh but that sported a brand new LCD illuminated dashboard - it would feel a mishmash and a mess.

Since a patent can keep coming back for examination after every rejection, they typically generate more responses than patents.<p><i>> 2. patent offices are funded through maintenance fees... </i><p>Actually, while maintenance fees are the largest portion of revenues, they are also funded by examination and issuance fees:
<a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/about/stratplan/ar/USPTOFY2014PAR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/about/stratplan/ar/USPTOFY2014PAR.pdf</a><p>They get paid an examination fee every time 1) someone files a patent application and 2) someone requests for further prosecution after they get a &quot;final&quot; rejection.<p>You could also argue that this creates a perverse incentive to keep rejecting patents, especially as issuing rejections can also be easy for an examiner. They are supposed to attack every element of the claim and prove it is covered by specific sections of prior art, but I&#x27;ve seen responses where they literally dismiss entire claims with some vague prior art references. And there is really nothing an applicant can do about such behavior other than suck it up and pay for continued examination.<p><i>> the existing patent system simply isn&#x27;t a good fit for software... </i><p>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s not true anymore. There was period where patent offices suddenly had to start accepting software-based patents and didn&#x27;t know how to deal with them, resulting in poor quality patents. Things are lot tighter now.<p>Also, I wouldn&#x27;t conflate &quot;business method&quot; patents with &quot;software&quot; patents. In fact, there is no such thing as &quot;software&quot; patents. There are only patents on solutions to problems that happen to be best solved with software. Business methods are just one such area of problems (which I&#x27;d agree are not amenable to patenting).",1438172147

Maybe check you have &quot;crossfade tracks&quot; disabled in Spotify&#x27;s advanced settings.",1438171348

Those are already a massive pain.<p>Then i also listen to vocaloid music, where the complexity gets downright insane. Vocaloid music is music where the &quot;performer&quot; is a software using a prerecorded soundbank to render the vocals into the final piece.<p>For those you typically have: The song writer, the music writer, the music arranger, the vocals arranger and one to many soundbanks (which may come in variants, with two soundbanks being recorded from the same person, but with different tonal qualities). And to put the cherry on top, most of the people making this music only put them on youtube or niconico, the japanese youtube.<p>Getting sound files with any sort of useful metadata for those is almost impossible.",1438171260

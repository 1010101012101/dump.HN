By threatening, instead of doing what an assertive person might do (which might be to simply walk away with the code that you own and wait for them to contact you with a sweet offer in writing), you might be sending them a message that is poisoning the negotiations. It <i>is</i> possible to be passively abusive to people. It might be your own greed and anxiety that is preventing you from being a stand-up person, doing the stand-up thing, and making money off of this situation.",1223218650

324111,comment,323787,323787,0,0,prime0196,,,"I would find out who is really pulling the strings.  Could the founder's lawyers or maybe the investor be asking that all parties involved sign an NDA?  Are the founders merely advising themselves?  You may want to think about having a meeting with everyone(founders, lawyers, investors) and find out where the contingencies are.  The people in control may not even know your situation.",1223218401

Communism assumes that we are (or can be made) purely altruistic (""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" collapses if there is just a single selfish, greedy actor present).<p>That's why free markets work remarkably better than communism.",1223218302

324106,comment,324035,324035,0,0,antiform,,,"That was a remarkably well-reasoned and plainspoken summary of some cool facts and trends in ""sociobiology."" I remember seeing a talk about evolutionary psychology early in my college career and dismissing it as imprecise, speculatory nonsense, but perhaps I judged too quickly. It seems more interesting and credible when the person talking about it doesn't seem like a crackpot. I'll take another look when I get the chance.<p>Also, on ""A scientist would rather use another scien­tist's toothbrush than his termino­logy,"" I think that goes double for mathematicians. For instance, in complex analysis, ""analytic,"" ""holomorphic,"" ""regular,"" ""differentiable,"" and ""complex differentiable"" all mean the same thing in the context of functions/maps, with various subfields of mathematics adopting one or the other at various times.",1223217256

And if I skip out on updating, then comes the script kiddies using all the holes to exploit the site and others to plug ads and spam. And when I get around to updating, all the customization hacks done to the wordpress installation either completely goes fubar or everything comes to a screeching halt.<p>/rant<p>Spend a day, write your own cms and save a ridiculous amount of time in the long run while having total control over your features.",1223216646
324101,comment,324035,324090,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Selfish, greedy, unrelated, <i>and fertile</i>.<p>E.O. Wilson's point was that since each worker ant is closely related to the rest of the colony, and they can't reproduce themselves, it's in the best interest of their genes to look out for the colony.  We could get a similar effect by sterilizing humans (perhaps this is why monarchies have used eunuchs as their closest advisors and attendants), but I don't think it'd go over well.<p>Ants are selfish and greedy too, when it comes to warfare between colonies.",1223216565

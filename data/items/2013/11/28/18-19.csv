6815914,comment,6814383,6814572,9,0,gboudrias,,,"As a huge believer in unconditional income, let me address your whole comment:<p>> The thing I genuinely don&#x27;t understand regarding the basic income for all argument is that surely it just moves the goal posts rather than solves the problem at hand?<p>I agree, but I see it as a good first step towards getting rid of the plague that is (savage) capitalism.<p>> In the current system, you can go stay at home and get income support, which should provide you with the basics i.e. a home, food, electricity etc. If you would like more than this, you can go and get a job and hopefully earn more (have a better lifestyle) than staying at home not working.<p>The problem is that a lot of minimum wage employees are treated with minimum respect since they really are forced to be there. This way of thinking makes everyone miserable by not considering the quality of life of those concerned. And I&#x27;m just talking about &quot;not being verbally abused&quot; here basically, not even &quot;have a nice kitchen&quot;. And there aren&#x27;t enough public employees to ensure people don&#x27;t get treated like shit.<p>> This therefore means there is an incentive to go work. There is also control, to make sure the money the unemployed person is getting is mostly spent on the basics (such as housing, rather than say drugs).<p>See, I disagree that the state should have such moral authority. But more to the point, this provides an incentive to the state to disregard basic needs (thereby reducing &quot;needed&quot; money) and pretend everyone has the same basic needs (thereby giving more people an arbitrary minimum). Also, people are still currently buying drugs/alcohol with their state money, because at the end of the day addiction will often win over food, and that&#x27;s not a problem you solve by giving people less money (who will only starve more and/or commit more crimes).<p>> The problem with suddenly giving everyone a minimum amount of money, is that due to everyone now &#x27;at least&#x27; having that amount of money at hand, this becomes the new &#x27;bottom&#x27; of the market. If I get a job, I earn money on top of this basic amount, which means I can afford nice things and the person unemployed still can&#x27;t afford anything.<p>That&#x27;s on purpose. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a communist scheme. But don&#x27;t forget that food and house prices are/can be mostly controlled by the state, so it can make sure that everyone gets the real basics (as it already tries to do).<p>> If let&#x27;s hypothetically say, you gave everyone in Vietnam this basic wage, the cost of beer would not remain at 14 pence. The first reason is because the work force would find their existing pay negligible compared to the basic pay (so wages would have to rise to be incentive to work on top of basic pay) which would in turn cause cost of manufacturing to rise, but also the market would realise with this extra money available - the price could be set higher and would rise accordingly.<p>That&#x27;s also on purpose. One of the points is that everyone gets to be treated in a non-shitty manner, which means everything is going to cost more to produce, which means the middle class and above will be poorer on average, all things considered. I count that as a good thing (reducing income gap). However we&#x27;re not talking about Vietnam (or China or Taiwan), because the powers that be would not allow the world factories to fuck up their way of life. This program only makes sense in first world countries, if we&#x27;re aiming for things staying the same.<p>> Now back in the UK if this was to occur, you would have slight price rises due to these factors which would in affect move the poverty line up higher, which would mean the people at the bottom are still poor relatively.<p>Right. But more people would be able to not work under terrible conditions.<p>> What&#x27;s worse is that assuming the people who are unemployed are given the choice on how that money is spent, they may in fact not spend the money sensibly (i.e. on their housing) and end up homeless instead.<p>That doesn&#x27;t really make sense, since people need an address now to receive welfare, and I see no reason for this to change. If you&#x27;re homeless you have a whole new set of problems, which would not be addressed by the measure afaik.<p>> The final problem with this model is that the cost of living and economic output is not evenly distributed throughout a country. £1750 a month in northern England may give you a fantastic lifestyle, where as in London you&#x27;d barely cover your rent. (What happens to the unemployed in London in a fixed give everyone a basic income situation? They have to leave London and move where they can afford, which then makes it potentially harder to find a job and splits the country into two halves, the elite / the poor).<p>This is a problem and needs to be addressed. I don&#x27;t really think people on welfare can currently afford to live in London anyway (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), so it doesn&#x27;t really change anything.<p>All in all, remember that no one <i>wants</i> to have a shit life and be homeless. So if you give people money, they&#x27;re likely to use that money to get a better/steady life rather than fucking up their life. There will be people who &quot;mooch&quot; on the system, but there already are. This is about working conditions and the right to be treated fairly (and to left-wingers like me, the right not to work).",1385665005

6815909,comment,6814211,6815191,2,0,jmpe,,,"That&#x27;s for a large part due to the charging speed itself. If you charge at the maximum allowed current your battery will have the shortest longevity. Most chargers advertise on the capability to charge fast, but for a lot of battery chemistries it comes with that trade off. If you have the habit of charging over night I&#x27;d suggest to buy a slow charger or trickle charger. The slowest (optimum longevity) are typically &quot;40 rate&quot; which means (I&#x27;m simplifying here) the charge current is 1/40 the Max capacity current and takes about 40 hours to charge.<p>Note: don&#x27;t go cheap by buying Chinese crap for battery chargers, especially Li chemistries.

There&#x27;s nothing intrinsically wrong with &quot;throwing your weight around,&quot; as you put it.  For example, that&#x27;s exactly what IBM was doing when they decimated SCO&#x27;s absurd lawsuit.<p>Microsoft was hated because they aggressively pushed out competitors in dishonest ways, because they intentionally made it difficult to interoperate with their software through proprietary protocols and file formats, and because they attacked open source.<p>Some of your questions directly illustrate why &quot;throwing your weight around&quot; can be a good thing. Did Sun/Oracle accuse Google of &quot;stealing&quot; Java?  Yes, but do you really want to live in a world where people can copyright APIs, thereby giving creators of popular APIs a large amount of control over everyone else?

The original document was discussing the problem of text normalization, which still remains.<p>If I have a database of employee bios and I write an app so HR can search that database, it&#x27;s no problem for them to type in &quot;management&quot; and get a list of all employees with the word &quot;management&quot; in their bio.  But when a division does the same thing in a non-English-speaking country where there&#x27;s an é in the word, then that word can be composed of either two characters or one and searching one way will tend to miss any results which were composed of text the other way.

When she would not settle, they picked 24 of the 1700 songs and actually filed suit for statutory damages. Why 24, instead of all 1700? I&#x27;ll cover that at the end.<p>Statutory damages range from $750 per infringed work to $30000. If the defendant can prove she was an &quot;innocent infringer&quot;, the low end drops to $200 per infringed work. An innocent infringer is an infringer who did not know and had no reason to believe they were infringing. If the infringement is willful, the high end can go up to $150000. The actual amount within that range is determined by the jury.<p>Since she was in fact guilty, and should have easily known she had almost no chance of winning at trial, and almost no chance of convincing anyone she was an innocent infringer. It is then a simple matter or arithmetic to conclude that going to trial is in the best realistic case going to result in a minimum of $18000 damages. This is the point where those who are not massively stupid say &quot;I&#x27;d like to accept your settlement offer now&quot;.<p>As I said, the actual amount of damages awarded is determined by the jury. She had tried to destroy evidence, she was caught in outright lies on the stand, and she tried to blame her children and boyfriend for the infringement. This probably made the jury less likely to head down to $750 per work, and they ended up at $9000 per work.<p>Why sue over just 24 songs, instead of all 1700?<p>Contrary to popular belief, they aren&#x27;t setting out to ruin people&#x27;s lives. When they catch a pirate and make a settlement offer, they offer a very reasonable amount, typically around $2-4 per infringed song, which comes out in most cases to a few thousand dollars. This is large enough to be annoying and serve as a discouragement to others, but not so large in most cases to seriously mess up one&#x27;s life for a long time.<p>If they cannot get a settlement and it goes to trial, they cannot ask for $2-4 per song. That&#x27;s below the minimum possible statutory damages award. If they sued over all 1700 songs in the Thomas-Rasset case, for instance, a win would result in a minimum award of $1.3 million, and probably much much more. Since they will be happy with a much smaller amount, they can cut down on the number of songs and still achieve their goals.<p>Also, there is a cost to including a song in the lawsuit. For each song, they need to make sure it was properly registered with the copyright office, and show that they are authorized by the copyright owner to sue on his behalf. The court will know about the settlement offer and so will know what kind of damages the plaintiff finds acceptable, and might get annoyed if it perceives them as just piling on. You do not want to annoy the court.<p>I don&#x27;t know how they came up with specifically 24. 7 would be enough at $750 per song to get the $5000 they were initially looking for. Toss in a few more to allow for the possibility that the defendant will be able to find some flaw in the paperwork or in the RIAA&#x27;s right to act on behalf of the copyright holder on some of them. Maybe they now want more than $5000 because their collection costs have risen in this case from &quot;write a letter&quot; costs to &quot;prepare a lawsuit&quot; costs.<p>Or it could be that a list of 7 songs (enough to get the $5000 they want) just looks small. Perhaps they believe a jury will think &quot;why are they wasting our time over a measly 7 songs?&quot; and so go with a beefier list.",1385662683
6815742,comment,6815321,6815638,7,0,ygra,,,"Most high-level languages have the drawback that they usually cannot inter-operate with anything else, or if they can, it gets very ugly. This begins with C++ being impossible to consume from anything else than C++ and certainly doesn&#x27;t stop with Java or similar languages. For a portable, low-level library that aims to exist nearly everywhere I doubt there is anything better than C.<p>And you&#x27;d need tests either way. With certain high-level languages you could reduce the need for valgrind and signed integer overflow tests perhaps, but nearly all other test (and thus error) classes remain. You will want to be safe from regressions, you will want to make sure that you can recover gracefully upon process termination, OOM or power failures. You also want to make sure that your SELECT doesn&#x27;t yield different result sets than other database engines for the same data set.<p>All those cases are not going away, just because you use a different language. And proving things correct necessitates that your formal model accurately describes what you want to create. Bugs in said model will still be bugs in the application, even if you proved that the application conforms exactly (which still isn&#x27;t easy).",1385662666

A consequence of the page bloat is that the ipad 1 has become almost unusable to browse the web because it has only 256 mb ram. If the current page doesn&#x27;t fit in ram, safari closes down. I remember at one point that browsing slashdot and amazon on a machine with 128 mb ram worked just fine. There&#x27;s no reason for the current bloat aside from simply not caring about efficiency.",1385661807

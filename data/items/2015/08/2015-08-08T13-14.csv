Not a big problem in this case, but worth mentioning.<p>(2) If you have to be on your work VPN as well, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.  Being only on the work VPN often isn&#x27;t an option, as a lot of personal use might run into blocks and/or violate the company&#x27;s policy on use of their resources.<p>(3) Some sites block VPNs, either intentionally or unintentionally.

Its either a bike welded to a trailer (0:34), or a face replacement. The first Digital double is at 0:42 (there are lots more.)<p>So you can see that actually it happens a lot, and frankly there is nothing wrong with it. In fact there is a whole achademic field devoted to it, (fun thing, google &quot;digital doubles framestore&quot;)<p>Its basically a case of some dickhead wanting to see tits, and feeling cheated because he can&#x27;t command someone he&#x27;s never met to do a full frontal scene for the price of a movie ticket (or less)",1439039379

They are transported around the country by beekeepers every year, spreading their diseases and parasites. And they have their produce taken by humans.<p>Even if you removed all insecticides, they might improve a bit, but I doubt they would be doing <i>well</i>. And if they did get wiped out, so what?

A person on a movie can correlate to a real actor, but with improving CGI technology it might actually be anything; One actor, several actors, or maybe just bits on a hard drive.

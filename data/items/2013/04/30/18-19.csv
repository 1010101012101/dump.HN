I still can't agree though.<p>Any argument based on statistics is going to be strongly biased against the FDA's current procedure. It is impossible to predict how many deaths were prevented from keeping dangerous drugs off the market, so it is impossible to make a meaningful comparison. Furthermore, a simple utilitarian argument about the net lives saved is not how most people would comprehend the situation. The situation where a drug kills someone will be weighed much more gravely than the situation where a life-saving drug was kept from you because it couldn't be proven effective. So a net-lives-saved calculation simply doesn't capture the intuition that most people have.<p>Being biased towards conservatism is appropriate at the scale of approving drugs and advertisement towards an entire country. Most people do not have the knowledge (even considering the internet) to appropriately evaluate a drug. I would wager that even doctors are not equipped to make this sort of safety evaluation for their patients.

The overreaction to her tiny tweet was about a million to one and her very public flogging was so out of proportion and so misogynistic and racist that if I were her, I'd be scarred for life. It reminded me of those 3rd world stories that pop up every once in a while where some poor woman gets raped by an entire village as punishment for adultery. Let's not pile up on an already unfortunate situation by suggesting that the perpetrator of a tiny crime (if a rather temperate tweet that called a joke ""not cool"" can even be called a crime) has to apologize in the wake of other people's much, much larger crimes (from the firing of one of the jokers to rape threats to death threats).<p>On a larger note, it's never a minority group's responsibility to keep the majority prejudice-free.  We really need to dispose of the silly notion that it's our responsibility as women in tech to be 100% perfect lest some men decide to withdraw their respect. We do not deserve to be held to a higher standard than men who engage in irrational, drama llama or otherwise childish behavior <i>all the time</i> (case in point, the dongle joke that started the whole thing).<p>Our reputation does not need to be ""returned"" because it was never ""lost"". Adria Richards, take care of yourself.<p>P.S. You said, <i>I don't like how she's trying to speak for me</i> and want her to apologize.

Being unable to read, because it's too much information at once. Being unable to watch TV shows that have too many ""facts"" in them. All of the above -- including simple questions of ""What do you want for lunch, honey?"" -- triggered panic-like attacks in me, who'd never had a panic attack despite years of physical and emotional abuse as a child. It was like being surrounded and squeezed and shouted at by a million people all at once, just to try to listen to my lunch options.<p>Holy...! You have described my current condition even better than I could. Interestingly, I just came back from a doctor who, after reviewing my blood tests(standard blood tests), said that there wasn't anything wrong with me and my issues were lack of exercise. Which may be true, but getting out of the bed currently IS an exercise for me. It is getting better though, two months after quitting my job - I can even enjoy Hacker News again.<p>Since you've gone down this path, what would you suggest?

5633999,comment,5632321,5633861,1,0,manicbovine,,,"> 'Stripping away' is just division in another form...<p>I'd say that the terms ""stripping away"" and ""division"" are being used in slightly confusing ways here, and I'm not sure if ""stripping away"" is ""division in another form"". But I guess that's not your point. Anyhow, you started off this thread by essentially saying something like ""experience varies, so it can be endlessly subdivided"", and someone else chirped in with ""Yeah, that's basically Dennett's point of view."" I want to emphasize that variation in experience doesn't lead to endless subdivision, nor does Dennett make this claim.<p>Regarding the idea of ""qualia over time"", I think that sounds like an interesting line of thought. Let's just assume that qualia have some atomic structure -- an experience particle, if you will. Maybe it exists in the other half of some Cartesian reality.  Well, much like an electron persists over time (perhaps varying states along the way), I don't see why this imagined ""qualia particle"" cannot exist over time without  requiring us to subdivide it indefinitely.<p>Of course, I find this idea of ""qualia particles"" to be ridiculous and I bet you do too. It's just a tool to point out that persistence over time doesn't require indefinite subdivision.<p>> Right, intuitively, we feel there is something more to the process of experience. I get that. Yet many things we conceptualize don't work in an intuitive fashion. Why do we require experience to?<p>I don't think that our intuition about experience is the last word on qualia. On this point, I'm in complete agreement with Dennett.<p>EDIT: This whole issue of divisibility is a massive red-herring anyhow. The stanford encyclopedia does a much better job of defining qualia: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/</a> .",1367346610

For the people other than you, your changes exist in the future.<p>History rewriting in general lets you fuck around locally with stuff you haven't shared, making trashy checkpoint commits or whatever you want to do, and clean that all up to represent a logical series of changes for sharing.<p>In short:<p>Don't work on tracking branches. Branches are cheap.<p>Periodically bring in others changes into your work with rebase. Your work isn't public and theirs is, theirs is part of public history, yours is part of future history.

Often, the history cleanup I want to do is handled by merge --squash, bundling up the change I'm pushing as one commit.<p>You, whoever is looking at my incoming change, care about the fix for bug FOO or feature BAR being completed.

The results were interesting (""Oh there's someone offering a ride to Finland, how cool"").<p>Only at that point did I figure out what you were selling, so you definitely need to work on your copy on the landing page (""Ride, rent, and experience a new way to travel"" doesn't cut it, more like ""Find rides for sales and appartements for rent from multiple sources near you"").<p>I'm not familiar with the space, so I can't comment on how good the idea is (i.e. what your competition is), but it sounds like a good idea and nice execution.<p>A suggestion: maybe make it automatically locate me, and show something like 5 results on the landing page already, without the map but just in a nice list, to ""show"" what you're offering instead of telling through copy, and with a link ""See overview"" or ""See more"" or something.<p>An interface thingy: The flash messages in the bottom right didn't catch my eye at all until I scanned the map and saw them.

It's certainly inspiring. Both planes (the spaceship and the carrier) are very innovative designs and the system can be scaled up to orbital launches. Even without scaling, the mothership can, conceivably, launch an SS2-derived rocket into LEO (think same mass with liquid fuel and a relatively small payload). A modified SS2 could serve as first stage to a LEO-bound smaller rocket.<p>Both planes also make extensive use of composite materials, far more than most of the industry.

You're dividing experience into that which your stripping away and that which you're keeping. You keep doing this division until you get to the qualia. I think you can keep going with this. Say you look at a red dot at noon for ten seconds. There's no individual 'redness of red', there's the red you saw for the first second, the red you saw for the second second, and so on. This just leads to your next point though...<p>> Yet, we intuitively feel that there is something above and beyond those aspects of the experience.<p>Right, intuitively, we feel there is something more to the process of experience. I get that. Yet many things we conceptualize don't work in an intuitive fashion. Why do we require experience to?<p>I certainly think that there's more to experience and consciousness than meets the eye, I just wonder if examination of the process and trying to individuate experience as qualia is actually helping towards that goal.<p>I think the reason rejection of qualia is the mainstream point of view right now is because most everyone believes consciousness works like a computer. Sure, there's this world of hardware underlying the operating system, in the same way that there's a biological brain underlying consciousness, there's still this entire world we can reason about and play in and theorize about even despite this. There's no reason to go ""Oh, we're just robots"" because much of our behavior can be deduced from our neurology.

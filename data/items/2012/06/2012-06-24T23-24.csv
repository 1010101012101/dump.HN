4154553,comment,4154484,4154484,9,0,WTPayne,,,"Well, everything that jmolly says is true, but decoupling data and functional behavior is only part of it. Indeed, OOP was designed specifically to couple data and behavior together, so some people (at least) think that this is a good thing.<p>In my mind, the difficulty lies not with OOP per se, but in the thought-patterns and practices that have grown up around modern OOP programming, and the mental confusion that we have between the construction of models, the design of algorithms, and the creation of machines to help solve a particular problem. To a large extent, we lack the intellectual tools required to understand the problem; or, at least, the use and understanding of those tools is not widespread.<p>Personally, I suspect that there is a significant difference between product-centric thinking (design the product, ignore all else), and product-line-centric (or capability-centric) thinking (design the machinery that will make it trivially easy to design the product). This, for me, is a more important distinction than OOP vs FP, or any other dichotomy that you might care to mention.<p>I am not suggesting that I am right here, mind you: this is just the way that I feel; my gut instinct ... so perhaps some Socratic questioning might be in order here:<p>Let me start.<p>What problem, as software developers, are we actually trying to solve?",1340581720

4154550,comment,4154201,4154201,1,0,rst,,,"Turing was a brilliant mathematician, but he wasn't a businessman or a charismatic leader.  He did have a go at leading a computer development project (the ACE project) at a government lab, but got frustrated enough with the project and his role that he wound up decamping to what we'd now call a systems programming job for the machine being built at Manchester.  And even his fellow academics regarded him as a bit of an odd duck, not always easy to get along with or even to understand.  (Maurice Wilkes's memoir has some relevant anecdotes, including a conference talk in which Turing did blackboard arithmetic in the least-significant-digit-first notation that he'd adopted for the Manchester Mark I, to the general bafflement of the audience.)<p>There's a larger question, though, of whether something <i>else</i> could have made Britain a success in the computer industry.  Especially since they briefly started to do that.   It's not just that the British were hugely innovative (the group Turing joined at Manchester developed, among other things, the first index register, very early HLLs, and ultimately virtual memory).  More importantly, they were also the first to deploy computers in industrial use.  Ferranti's commercial version of the Manchester Mark I is arguably the first commercial machine to be delivered to a customer, and the LEO (a machine based on Cambridge University's EDSAC) was running logistics for a chain of tea shops in 1951.<p>So, why didn't these take off?  A couple of possible reasons:  First, building computers at the time was a very capital-intensive business, and there wasn't a whole lot of money for speculative ventures at the time --- both because ""Venture Capital"" in the way we're used to didn't really exist yet anywhere, and because postwar Britain was in pretty bad shape generally.  Second, rather than try to create conditions that would encourage researchers to branch out to industry, the government had an explicit policy of trying to license British-developed technologies to all comers, notably including American companies like IBM.  There's an MIT Press book on how this worked out; it's a dry read, but the title tells the tale:  ""Innovating for Failure.""<p>(By the way, similar things happened in other fields:  The Brits developed the world's first jet airliner, and wound up basically ceding the market to Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed.)",1340581532

4154473,comment,4153930,4154141,53,0,schacon,,,"I'm curious how you think it's possible for a structure like this to emerge after some level of success?  You think that any company sets up a traditional management structure, accomplishes success and then fires all the managers and tells everyone to work differently?  Or do you think it might be more likely that thinking differently early on about how to treat employees and how to focus creative energy somehow helps to achieve that success?<p>GitHub has always run this way, since it was 4 people.  When we tell people how we operate, they have always responded that it will never scale - people have told us that since we were 4.  We're now at nearly 100 employees and it's still working great. Valve is 300 and Gore has several thousand, so we're pretty sure we can keep going this way. We are slightly different than Valve, but their handbook really resonated with the way we do things.  The main difference between companies like Valve or GitHub and many other companies is that we don't look at other places and ask ourselves how we can copy their structures, how we can cargo cult their success, instead we look at our problems and ask ourselves how we can address them in the best way possible. It appears that Valve has done the same thing and we've come to some similar conclusions.<p>I think this is a big reason why we've been successful - that we ask ourselves this when approaching product too.  You say we're sitting pretty at the top, but when we started there were tons of source hosts.  Valve was just as bad - starting in another industry that was totally saturated.  The reason we were able to break through I believe was largely due to the fact that we thought about problem solving differently than the industry leaders that we started up against.<p>The real point you should take from the article is not that Gore or Valve or GitHub are lucky, but that we approach problem solving in a very different way and that might be an interesting thing to take a look at.  If all you read in an article like this is that we're 'goofy' or 'kooky' then you're missing everything that's important and it's a waste of time for you to read the article at all.  In fact, if that's what you take and then you try to copy us you will fail horribly in what you do, because you're blindly copying the least important of the many symptoms of this approach.<p>Approach problems from first principles. Figure out what the best possible experience would be for the person using your product (not just the person buying it). Make that experience a reality. Don't copy anyone. Do that same thing internally. Now what does your company and your product look like?  That should be what you take from this article.",1340579344

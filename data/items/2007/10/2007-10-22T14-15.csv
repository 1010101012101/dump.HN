Its biggest fault is that there are so few bugs that I'm not motivated to keep up with new releases.<p>There is at least one other JVM-based Scheme implementation out there, and it's stable and well maintained too.",1193065143

71143,comment,71054,71054,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"DZone (www.dzone.com) has that endless pagination thing. If you scroll the articles down, they just keep loading up.<p>
I've got to admit I'm conflicted about this issue. On one hand, what the heck is the point in making the users flip through a dozen pages? Simply to get more hits and ad revenue? On the other hand, the google-can't-index-you issue sucks. And users are used to using the back button and paginators at the bottom of the screens. I guess right now I think that pageless navigation is a ""better"" way, but I'm not sure the users or market has caught up with it yet.",1193063187
71142,comment,70999,70999,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There are limits in human abilities. We actually don't multi-task very well at all. Concentration is key.<p>This means that the scarcity of time should kill all illusions of the potential to do it all. There just isn't enough time to get good at many things.<p>If we could fork our intelligence, learn and do multiple things at once, even if only virtually, and then merge the result, we'd get closer to the ideal. Unfortunately, this is still science fiction.",1193063052
71141,comment,71121,71121,0,0,amalcon,,,"Heh... From reading the first part of this, I rather expected it to be an implementation of a Lisp-like language (complete with first-class functions, macros, the whole deal, maybe sans some of the bloat) on top of some other runtime environment like Java or Python.  That would give the developer the power of Lisp with the libraries of some other language.<p>It quickly became apparent that it was just an attempt to ""dumb down"" Lisp.<p>Incidentally, does anyone know of a (mature) language that does the above?  Preferably derived from Scheme?  I have really wanted to use this for some time, but I've resisted implementing it myself, thinking that ""Someone MUST have done this by now...""  As it happens, people have, but it's typically more of an ""I hacked this together last weekend; please don't actually use it for anything!"" type project.",1193062984

71139,comment,71129,71138,0,0,chris_l,,,"Yes, I've done a major project in Common Lisp and had to do so many things on foot, I just ran out of steam. I guess it depends on how many libraries you can use as they are, and how much you have to write yourself anyway.",1193062175

71137,comment,70963,71018,0,0,brk,,,"I think yours is a common feeling among true hackers.  Sales is less of a ""binary"" thing, there are too many other grey areas that get in the way of making it a process that can be solved with pure ""math"".<p>You could say that I am more of a social-engineering hacker than a software hacker.  Although, I know more than a fair bit of perl, C++, SQL, linux, etc.  I've written my own apps and various bits of glue logic as part of getting a sale done, because I could, and because it was the most efficient use of resources.<p>But sales-hacking is (IMO) sort of a language or process unto itself.  It can be fun and challenging and rewarding (when it's not utterly aggravating :)  )",1193061895

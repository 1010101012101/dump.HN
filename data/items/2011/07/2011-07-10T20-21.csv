I say this as someone who has a couple of websites that grew out of emails I wrote on lists where I was popular and then, when I left one such list, the websites largely languished, in part because they had no audience, there was no one whom I was speaking to, there was no definition for what I should communicate.  In recent weeks, I seem to no longer be the red headed bastard stepchild in some circles and, combined with other events in my life, I am beginning to write more.  For now, I am mostly writing more emails for some subjects and it hasn't really led yet to significant development of the websites on those topics. I expect it to eventually lead to that, but it hasn't yet. However, on another topic entirely, I have found an audience and am suddenly productive after languishing a long, long time, even though the intended audience is currently only one person.<p>If you don't know whom you are speaking to, it is difficult to know what to say.<p>Best of luck.",1310331460

Honestly, that's how I feel about requiring a car to be <i>more</i> noisy.  The only reason people rely on cars being noisy is that they <i>always have</i> been noisy.  It's not like engine noise is the only thing separating life and death.  Consider parking lots, which are exactly the kind of close-quarters, limited visibility place where engine noise would be vital, if it were really vital.  When a parking lot is too busy to pinpoint the engine noise of a nearby car -- when there are cars all around, shopping carts jangling over rough pavement, people talking, PA systems blaring announcements, noise reflecting off all the metal surfaces -- does that make it a deadly environment?  No.  People are careful, and accidents are rare.  Relying on sound is not a necessity; it's just a habit that has become a mistake.<p>The danger is based entirely on people needing to adjust their assumptions about cars, which has basically already happened for people in the United States, where hybrids are now commonplace.  The longer we can hold off this insanity the more obvious it will be that it <i>is</i> insanity.  Who in 2015 will assume that cars are noisy, if we don't commit the folly of making them noisy?  In 2020?  Or we could choose to make cars noisy now and be stuck with the noise pollution forever.",1310329131

If you are saying ""These four functions can be written in assembly"" then you are not saying anything interesting about C, because it is true of <i>any</i> language that it is possible to write its library in assembly if it's possible to write it at all.<p>In more detail.<p>Whether you can write va_arg in C depends on the platform's calling convention.  On most platforms you can (because the default calling convention has to support varargs, and the easiest way to do that is to push the arguments on the stack) but on x86-64 you can't.<p>setjmp and longjmp cannot be written in C on any platform I'm familiar with, unless you're writing them on top of something like setcontext, which has a slight superset of their functionality.  They are, however, very simple to write in assembly.<p>You can write sbrk in one line of C, and the glibc implementation is only ten: <a href=""http://koala.cs.pub.ro/lxr/glibc/misc/sbrk.c#L29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://koala.cs.pub.ro/lxr/glibc/misc/sbrk.c#L29</a>
But sbrk is simply a convenience wrapper around brk, which is necessarily a system call.  And C doesn't have a ""system call"" statement.<p>(Actually, you can write brk in C too if you just want to allocate out of some fixed blob of address space, which is a reasonable choice on, say, a microcontroller.)",1310328798

It seems like, for non-variadic calls at least, it should take the same amount of time to add a constant to %esp whether you're doing it in the RET instruction or in the caller; but factoring that code into the callee should improve code density and therefore icache hit rates.  What am I missing?",1310328040

It makes street photography a lot more difficult.<p>I assume by sexual misconduct you mean someone taking pictures in the bedroom (as opposed to photographing women at the beach, which is public space - unless specifically prohibited). I feel that is too specific a protection to make the lives of legit photographers difficult. Instead, more severe punishments could be implemented to protect men and women whose sex videos are filmed without consent.",1310328007

3840152,comment,3839861,3839861,12,0,comex,,,"The fact that C++ is almost a superset of C is commonly used as an argument for C++, and the accepted answer in the post is a common response - C++ is not quite a superset of C, you have to cast malloc, you lose out on C99 features, etc.  But I think it misses the point: if you could really get the advantages of C++ by using its features in a few necessary places in your C code, I think it would be worth it to make your code slightly uglier to accommodate it.<p>You can't.<p>Generic containers are probably the C++ feature C is most sorely lacking.  But as soon as you start using map<> in your code, you have to deal with slower compilation in all the files that use it (if a map is declared in a header file, e.g. as a struct member, that could be quite a lot), repetitive code generation the linker might or might not optimize, verbose syntax (std::map<struct foo *>::iterator, yay), and the requirement (more or less) to use new instead of malloc for any struct that contains a C++ object.  And if you want your map's performance to not suck, you'll need to depend on either a nonstandard extension or C++11 to get hash_map/unordered_map.<p>Then there's writing templates - even in the context of C++, template code tends to be hideously ugly (template<typename T> everywhere, the aforementioned issues with code generation and sticking everything in header files, pages of confusing error messages when you mess up), and is hard to debug with a debugger.  Trying to use them with C can only lead to pain - especially since they work best when you have actual objects to specialize on.  Templates do allow certain C code to be written more nicely, such as binary formats where there are multiple versions of the same struct, but even then there are limitations to the magic - template-ness tends to spread to callers.<p>gcc apparently wanted to switch to C++ partly in order to use destructors: now you have spooky action at a distance, where the caller of your method is a closing brace, thanks to a declaration a page away somewhere up in the function.<p>Do you want to use a few classes to add some structure to your code?  It will certainly start to seem a bit forced to declare struct foo and functions like foo_alloc and foo_get_bar once you're in C++, when declaring a class expresses the concept more elegantly.  And then you're stuck with C++'s context sensitive nature (anyone who understands the code will know that it->getName() is a reference to Foo::getName, and fooCount used here is a member variable, so it's fine, right?) and poor separation of interface and implementation (it really doesn't make sense that you have to declare private fields in your header file, and it doesn't make compilation any better), and if you're not careful your code will start to feature a vector of objects where an array of ints is appropriate, or yet another method whose only purpose is to pass on slightly different arguments to a method of a member variable.<p>C++ programmers accept these issues in exchange for a high-level coding style (less security bugs!) and an easier time writing clean code than C programmers (although bad C++ code is a whole lot worse than bad C code).  You will gain hardly any of that by sprinkling C++ into C.  Solving these problems in C sometimes leads to more work and more verbose code, but the result is also often a better solution.  If you absolutely must have code generation, use a macro, they're not as bad as C++ programmers make them out to be - or, at least, they're ugly enough that most programmers know to use them very sparingly.  (I'm rather a fan of <sys/queue.h>, for example, although you do have to understand how it works to make sense of code that uses it.)",1334386190

Nor would we expect so with K groups, especially with exponentially decreasing prize amounts. If this is even slightly a risk, you can compensate by making the maximum number of prizes awarded a function of the number of participating teams.  For example, you can award 10 prizes if there are >100 teams, and if not award floor(num_teams/10) prizes, with the prize pool redistributed among the top 10%.<p>It was pure luck that the threshold for the million-dollar prize was crossed. If it had been arbitrarily set at 11% (as opposed to 10%), then there's a good chance the million dollar prize would have never been paid out.<p>The advantage of paying out K top prizes is that other teams that don't win outright may have developed additional useful models or insights (or used more computationally efficient algorithms), and you may access to these in this manner.",1334385746

The realities of corporate politics, management, social dynamics, etc. say that the frequency of the review (or if you even get one) is mostly out of your control.  Further, the amount of the increase may have little to do with you; maybe there's ""no room in the budget for increases this quarter"", or maybe your manager is giving you poor evaluations to try and keep you from being promoted out of his department thus reducing his headcount.  Finally, there is a force in almost every organization that says that salary should be based on <i>seniority</i> not merit.  There may be pay grades, or salary caps, and there is almost always some limit on the size of the raise any person can get without a top exec signing off on it.  I could go on.  :)<p>Meanwhile, you (hopefully!) have more knowledge and skills than when you were hired; you certainly have more experience.  After a few years, you are almost certainly worth a lot more than when you were hired.  (If the job market has improved since you were hired, this goes triple.)<p>The end result is that, for most people, your salary represents a pretty good snapshot of your ""worth"" when you are hired, but every quarter thereafter it diverges.  Changing jobs periodically lets the good employees ""lock in"" that extra value.  (Meanwhile the poor employees will do their utmost to stay, as they know they may not deserve all of the raises they've received.  This is but one of many reasons why organizational performance trends downwards over time.)<p>You'd think that you could just renogotiate with your current employer.  ""Hey, I know I was only worth $60k when you hired me, but I'm now an expert on X, Y, and Z, and the job market is really hot right now.  I know you've upped my salary to $90k, but you'd have to pay over $140k to replace me.  Give me a raise or I'll go next door and get $120k.""  Seems logical, but human nature being what it is, this never works.  Instead, you quit and go to work next door for $120k, while one of their guys quits his $90k job and comes to work at your old employer for $120k.  Of course, both of you are now less productive for the next 6 months as you learn new systems and a new codebase.  It's silly, but there you are.",1334385409

Even C has it... for instance in your example printf formats to a buffer and writes at some later time, which is concurrent in that the next numbers can be created and formatted before the first is printf operation is complete.<p>But the reason almost nobody uses any of the general forms of this concurrency (coroutines, fibers) is because the general case of this is as useless as it is easy to do.  For instance there are plenty of C coroutine libraries (including Russ' libtask) and they work fine.  The reason nobody uses them is the because the situations where this is called for are precious few.<p>The other day on reddit Ian of gccgo even butted into a conversation about 1:1 threads vs m:n threads, but could not muster up an answer as to what conditions m:n threads (ala goroutines) would be called for.

Until harassment and BS is stamped out for the people already in the industry, the people who have a choice whether to enter the industry or not aren't going to be easily persuaded.

As a kid (I'm 34 now) my late father (hardcore electrical engineer) used to bring home electronics junk so I could build robots aged 10 (solder+Commodore 64 joystick port+Lego+Basic). Then I got bored of robotics for a long time.
For 11 yrs I've worked as an A.I. consultant after an AI degree/MSc, recently I wanted to hack, play and build fun stuff so I setup the AICookbook.com with Google Group and I'm posting my play-time projects. Headroid is one of them, there's also OCR (see the Plaque entry on the blog), NLP, recommendation engines, data mining, game play (auto Zork solver anyone?) and more to be done. I'm also a part of Brighton's HackerSpace (BuildBrighton.com) which is where I met BotBuilder who built the servo board and frame.
All are welcome to come join the fun :-)",1277713643

1467405,comment,1466164,1466257,0,0,roel_v,,,"There are, roughly, two schools in modeling (I'm not in the finance modeling field but I see no reason to believe it's different there): extrapolation and process modeling. Extrapolation becomes better with more data and more accurate descriptions of the curve. Process modeling becomes better with (duh) understanding the processes better. Of course in practice all models incorporate aspects of both. My point is that just adding data isn't the only way to improve a model, and in my opinion, it's even only relevant after you've achieved a sufficient level of accuracy in your process description. In my limited understanding of financial modeling, quants focus a lot on the mathematical aspects.",1277713160

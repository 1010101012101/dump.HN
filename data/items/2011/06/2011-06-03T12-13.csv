I once worked in a company that (after I left) made a huge investment in WebClasses, as they ""were the future"" of web development on Microsoft platforms. ""The Future"", as often happens, didn't last long.<p>Microsoft hasn't clearly ditched neither .NET (and .NET permeates most of Microsoft's server business) nor Silverlight and the ""classic"" view will still be there for when it makes sense (and it really does in a lot of scenarios). I suspect, however, ""modern"" apps will prefer to use the cleaner tile interface. If things like Gmail and Google Docs taught us something, is that simple interfaces are a good idea. With the onslaught of fresh desktop GUI ideas like Apple's full-screen apps, Gnome's new shell, and Canonical's Unity, Microsoft had to show something.<p>And that's what damns them. When a competitor, any competitor, shows something, they make themselves show something like it. Frankly, this whole tile thing has ""PDC 2003"" written all over it.",1307105458

Unless the tiling interface is the <i></i>primary<i></i> mode of use, then most people simply won't use it and it'll be relegated to the list of features the OS has, that simply no one uses. Think ""Windows SideShow"".<p>Of course, this all depends on what MS are planning on doing - and I think they've made yet another PR misstep (even if it's only to developers) in that they've simply not released enough information.

Her only regret seemed to be that she was dying.<p>I don't believe this list of top 5 regrets is based on research at all. I suspect that it is mostly only in TV, movies, or novels where a person on their deathbed contemplates things they would have done differently. Usually the impending death overwhelms all other thoughts.",1307102650
2615997,comment,2615621,2615797,2,0,jodoherty,,,"I agree. For most existing users, especially power users, this will probably be as insignificant on the desktop as Active Desktop and Active Channel were in Windows 98 or maybe desktop gadgets in Windows Vista. I mean, who even remembers that stuff?<p>For some users like my dad, the tiled interface with a touch screen should make it easier to use the computer. He doesn't use them enough to learn the whole stacks of windows metaphor and all the operations involved with it, but he can pick up an iPad and use it just fine.<p>The real significance I see here is that Windows mobile developers with just the skills of a web developer can now target desktop and tablet users fairly easily with the same exact code and a similar UI. If Microsoft releases their own App store for Windows 8, then that provides a unified platform for developers to sell the same product to every kind of Windows user from kids with smartphones to grandparents with a desktop PC.<p>And if the tiled interface takes off with the not so computer-literate, there'll be a great new demand for applications that fit into it's metaphors to prevent the jarring experience of being thrust back into a classic Windows-like environment, kind of like the demand for GUI applications after Windows supplanted MS-DOS.",1307102642

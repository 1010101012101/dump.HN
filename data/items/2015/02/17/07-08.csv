9061095,comment,9058701,9061002,0,0,kw71,,,"Usually a booting PC will issue several identify commands and try a SMART health check, and if there is a RAID option ROM then specific series of READ will be issued.  If it would really disclose itself with simple RESET, READ interrogation then I must be a better malware author than those players.  I don&#x27;t think I am, and I feel that if it would give itself away without ensuring that the OS is really booting, this is a big flaw.  If it were my project, it would be a showstopper.  I&#x27;m a noob in the sense that I have never considered malware before, so probably the developers (who are smarter than me) thought about it long before I did.<p>This flaw would also make it much simpler to write a script for MHDD that would reveal the infection on the infected target itself after booting from a floppy.<p>I think a JTAG probe is not especially useful to analyze a hard disk.  The flash on the board is usually only a bootstrap and &quot;physical driver&quot; of sorts.  The rest of the firmware is stored on the media - you can see that many disks do not even know what they are if you disconnect the heads and try to identify.<p>I think JTAG is not commonly in the toolbox of the data recovery guys who dump firmware modules and trade them.  DR sometimes involves replacing corrupted firmware that is on the disk, or reprogramming a controller board to match one that&#x27;s failed.  They have bought software and serial port cables, and this seems to handle it for them, so I concluded that there must be a way to dump all of the firmware - on chips and disks - with ATA commands or the serial port, and we know from field-service tools that there is usually a way to update it all with only ATA commands.",1424159386
9061094,comment,9057034,9059867,0,0,xaa,,,"> Longevity research is currently a career dead end.<p>Ouch, that&#x27;s my career ;)<p>But the current trick to do longevity research in a way that will be funded is to point out how major diseases have age as a major risk factor, and that to tackle cancer, heart disease, etc, we need to understand more about aging. And that the median age in the US is increasing, therefore age-associated diseases will cause more of a health care cost burden.<p>In absolute terms, our society spends a pittance on this important problem. But relative to other biomedical researchers, aging researchers don&#x27;t have that hard a time. You just have to be careful not to make overly bold claims and be lumped in with de Grey et al.<p>To summarize my thoughts on this article, I will add that I independently came to much the same conclusions as the OP, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m doing what I am.

Devices connected to those buses must be pooled by the system, they cant initiate transactions on their own.<p>On the other hand you have PCI/PCIe/FW/Thunderbolt/SCSI, those buses allow every device to take over as a temporary bus master, and some of them (Im not familiar/sure about scsi, probably not) allow arbitrary memory access.<p>So you cant use SATA in a way FW can be exploited. There might be some obscure state machine bugs in some hardware host implementations, but why bother when you have low hanging fruit of access to raw binary data.

It would be a twisted interpretation of that to allow (eq x x) to ever return false.<p>Now (eq 1 1) is specifically not required to return true, as, for example an implementation that boxes all numbers could create two separate objects for that expression, and the arguments are now in fact not the same identical object.<p>This is something that exposes implementation details to the user, so using eq is discouraged (and in fact it can only portably be used to compare symbols).  There are times when the best way to accomplish what you are doing is to (ab)use implementation specific behavior, and this is particularly true of Lisp which was a dynamically typed garbage collected language in the 70s (yes, predating the VT100 terminal referenced in this article).",1424156853

With them you could set up a proxy server (I prefer nginx) in front of the apps for your clients and serve them all from a single vps. The traffic of 10-1000 of users is not too big but if you feel that performance of an app is degrading you can always migrate it to a managed hosting service like heroku.

While it&#x27;s nice to push rendering out to clients for saving your server CPU, that can lead to a suboptimal mobile experience, requiring more CPU and battery power on the mobile device to work on the javascript and render the page.  There are other factors, for sure, but you want to be keeping client side javascript down to a minimum.<p>Taking a quick spin through yslow in the mobile browser suggests they&#x27;ve got a number of areas to improve on to make the time to screen significantly better on mobile devices (even on a fast connection here it took several seconds to even start showing me content, and several more before it had finally loaded everything)<p>Given the world wide reach of the BBC, expecting high speed and low latency networks seems like a bad idea.  In the US, 3G & 4G typically see 90-100ms latency per request. Mobile Yslow is reporting that they&#x27;ve got 21 javascript scripts alone on the page.  IIRC The android browser will limit itself to 4 threads retrieving content typically so that&#x27;s (21/4 * 100ms) 525ms just lost in latency requesting the javascript, let alone actually downloading it and the overhead of the javascript renderer.  It&#x27;s also pulling in content from 21 different websites, so at the bare minimum that&#x27;s 21 DNS calls being made (with the same latency penalty!)

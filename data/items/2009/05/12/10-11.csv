If the interviewer is looking for a discussion on that he will pick up and ask for more. If not he will let it pass (and probably note that your recognised the issue).<p>In an interview you must dangle relevant information in front of the interviewer and wait for him to pounce on things he wants more information on :)<p>Also: NEVER assume a concept the interviewer has ""never heard"" of IS something he/she has never heard of.

""The financial sector...rapidly burn[ing] through their political capital"" doesn't imply that I should get five cents on the dollar while people behind me in line get forty.

I think most Perlmongers like that folks are talking about the language as something new and interesting again.  But, I suspect it's not entirely Perl 6 that's to blame.  Moose has been raising a lot of eyebrows lately, and with good reason...and it's actually usable today.  Very few people are writing actual software in Perl 6, so it seems unlikely that folks are twittering about it all that much.  But, lots of folks are building software with Perl 5 and Moose.",1242123786

Each server has a single type of resource - slots (Note that in real world servers have more resources CPU/memory/disk/etc...).\nLet a server have M slots.\nServers can run virtual machines, every VM occupies from 1 to M slots.\nOnce the VM (with k slots) starts on a server, the number of free server slots is reduced accordingly.\nWhen the VM stops, the occupied slots are freed.<p>VMs can live-migrate across servers. For example, when there is no server with M free slots (every server runs at least one VM), and we need to start an M-slot VM - there we need to rearrange VMs across a cluster.<p>The goal is implement a VM placement policy to satisfy the following requirements:<p>* utilize server resources in a uniform way, e.g. if we have 3 servers and 3 single-slot VMs we should place them on different servers.<p>* minimize number of VM migrations as it is a costly operation.<p>It looks like the problem in question has something to do with multiple knapsack problem, so I'm looking for some kind of heuristic algorithm.<p>Any advise / papers / working solutions ?<p>Thanks in advance,<p>Kirill",1242123706

However, it's definitely the case that for both privacy and bandwidth reasons, sometimes it's a liability. We don't require a webcam so for now you can just disconnect it if you're uncomfortable with it, but we're planning to add an option to intentionally omit the webcam feed in the future.<p>Thanks for the idea on topics; we've got a lot of ideas in that space, but we wanted to launch as soon as we had a viable product.<p>Glad you liked the call quality, it's central to many of the features we're hoping to introduce in the future.

For myself, I don't believe I've said anything that qualifies as deriding anyone's credibility or history (or trying to make a post-hoc defense for myself).  I'm just trying to bring facts to light -- because a relevant issue was brought up, I took the time to pore through details I otherwise would not have.<p>In short, the issue brought up was that the sentence seems excessive given that ""child porn"" could mean a picture of 17 year olds.  Having done the research, it's clear that the picture was of much younger children, and that the length of the sentence was due to several factors beyond the ""child porn"" issue.

Then, create a visual ""tree"" around your specific hashtags by date which would basically take you through a historical account of your discovery process over a period of time.

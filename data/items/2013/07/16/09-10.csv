There is zero chance that anybody will believe what the US government / US companies will say from now on.

But I am confident they will emerge, since a huge market for these kind of services has opened up - before the Snowden relevations we were just suspicious, now we are certain.<p>And an important selling point of these services will be to not be US-based, and better yet, not run by any american company. Trust can not be regained, and <i>whatever</i> will be said won&#x27;t be believed: so you say that you are not spying on me? Yeah, sure! So you say you have no backdoors? Yeah, sure!

But prosecutors have refused to say whether the government obtained those individual warrants based on information derived from the 2008 law, which allows programmatic surveillance.&quot;<p>This <i>exactly</i> what I feared, and I thought would happen.

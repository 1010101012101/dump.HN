For example, our time spent on reading computer science books, learning more math, talking with other good programmers all affect our programming productivity. Moreover, learning to write clearly in English (or one's native language) also impacts how well one can code and comment. But much of those 'practices' has accumulated over years or even decades, some since childhood, some from family influence without one's trying.<p>The system you propose, if implemented, will soon degenerate to how well one can pretend to be disadvantaged or fake the effort, so that more rewards will be offered even when the work output stays the same. This is equivalent to giving bonus for the hours spent as face time in office while chatting on Facebook there.",1293346791

It's illegal to steal money from other people, barring taxes -- so other than taxes, <i>none</i> of it is stolen.<p>The only economic system that is not predatory is a free market, which is based on voluntary trade for mutual benefit; any other economic system involves coersion, which is required for something to be predatory. In the current economic system of the civilized world, government holds a monopoly on coercive power, so only the government and those influencing it can be/are predatory.<p>Among the people who have the most wealth (at least in the US), most of them are prey, not predators, if you agree with my claim about the nature of predation.<p>If you're going to make accusations, don't hint at them, make them.",1293346583

2040213,comment,2036588,2037139,0,0,bugsy,,,"The Constitution prohibits slavery except as a <i>punishment for crime</i>. The punishment for each crime is set by a judge during sentencing after a guilty conviction and it is very specific. Sentencing a prisoner to punishment in the form of prison for 10 years is not the same as sentencing to punishment of slave labor for 10 years. The two are completely different. If a judge has not sentenced the prisoner to slave labor as punishment, it is not Constitutional to have prison slave labor.<p>Slave labor convictions for blacks were very common in the South from reconstruction up until World War II when they fell out of favor. For 70 years from 1870 to 1940 it was quite routine whenever slave laborers were needed for companies to pay local sheriffs to round up blacks on bogus charges such as loitering, convict them in sham trials, and then sell them to corporations to do hard labor 6 days a week 14 hours a day. This is extensively documented in Blackmon's ""Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II.""",1293346518

They work in service jobs that will be trivially automatable in our lifetimes.</i><p>Most jobs that truly are ""trivially automatable"" have already been automatized. I think it's extremely unlikely that most or nearly most of Americans' jobs can be replaced by computers in our lifetimes, barring something like the Singularity happening (which I'm not holding my breath for).<p><i>Wealthy people will actually own the means of production in a very meaningful way</i><p>Like I said, this is a Marxist bromide. Fundamentally, the means of production is mens' minds.

If you are capable of making something amazing, you still need savings or investors who will feed and house you while you make those things and pay the still significant costs of infrastructure that many products require.</i><p>Big projects typically require capital investment, but so what? That can be gotten if you have a good idea. Also, lots of people that work in service jobs and don't need heavy capital investment do important, creative work. My point here is that, no, it's not ""very much about what you own."" Most people in America are doing just fine, especially those with an education, and most people in America did not inherit a trust fund or something.<p><i>Concentration of wealth matters. That doesn't necessarily mean that government intervention is a good idea.</i><p>If it has no implications, then by definition, it doesn't matter.

It's generally best to start on the highest interest loans first, but sometimes its more emotionally gratifying to have the visible progress of loans getting paid off.<p>As for consolidation, it depends on a few factors. A lower interest rate in the new loan is certainly good, but that benefit is limited if the consolidation will result in fees, or if you plan to have the loans paid off quickly (which I recommend if at all possible). In any case, always be careful about the small print, <i>especially</i> when it comes to private student loans, which are NOT all alike and are notoriously prone to pitfalls and gotchas (hooray banks).<p>You mentioned having loans managed by the Department of Education.

And some (maybe a few, maybe most, who knows?) of the very rich understand this; look at what Larry Page and Sergey Brin did in establishing Google's charitable foundation.

In ""our world"" (that is, computers, software, web-based consumer sites, etc.) it's already possible to build a software startup with a negligible amount of money.

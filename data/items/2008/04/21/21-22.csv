That much is certainly undeniable. But the online communities associated with such things have some significant downsides.<p>I hate to do this but I'm going to advocate acting classes. The reason I hate to do it is there's always somebody in an improv class who's obviously just there to become more spontaneous. If you study acting because you have a genuine interest in doing it, people who are there to become more spontaneous, or better at public speaking, or whatever, are just annoying as hell. Acting classes <i>do</i> make you socially adept but <i>PLEASE</i> avoid serious professional acting classes in favor of weekend workshops at community colleges. Also if you are ""that guy"" and you're taking acting classes without any real interest in acting please understand that the serious actors want you to die.<p>I think the best option suggested here is user groups and presentations in front of other geeks. Not because talking to geeks is going to expose you to incredible social skills - far from it - but because sincere interest is a much healthier motivator for any type of social activity than the desire to be social for its own sake.",1208815108
169958,comment,169715,169715,0,0,jrockway,,,"Why is everyone so concerned about people not using RDBMSs?  Database management systems are not magic, they are just a query parser on top of some smart data structures.  They are a generic solution, and might not be suitable for <i>every</i> situation, and that's why people are examining other data storage and retrieval methods.<p>It's kind of odd, but I've noticed that databases are a touchier subject than most things in the computer world.  If someone says they're not using a RDBMS, there is always someone who immediately jumps down their throat as though SQL is God's Gift To The World.<p>Anyway, RDBMS aren't going to go away, so if you like them, use them.  Some of us are willing to experiment with other solutions, however :)",1208815070

So, starting conversations is a great way to get over the fear of them, ending them in a reasonable time frame is a great way to insure you aren't crossing the boundary into uncomfortable (for the other person...I know that the introvert is going to be uncomfortable throughout the exchange, as I'm an introvert myself, and so the cues that may be obvious to most folks aren't as obvious to an introvert...insert boiling frog analogy here).",1208813754

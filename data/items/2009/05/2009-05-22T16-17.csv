Both Silverlight and AIR are cross-platform. NYT chose AIR over Silverlight for purely technical reasons that all seem reasonable. Silverlight is not as far along as AIR at this point, simple as that.<p>The article mentions a bunch of anti-Microsoft comments on the NYT web site, suggesting that 'Microsoft-rejection' led to the migration to AIR. I find that very unlikely.",1243011498

I don't like flash. I don't like any of them.  I think they run contrary to the future of the web.  I believe the web should be designed to run in the browser.<p>I don't like that flash is so heavily used. I install it, but I don't like it.  I don't use it myself. I think it's just one more vector for viruses, malware, and little flashy, moving things that distract me from text on the page and whatever it is I'm trying to do.  Of course video and audio is still an issue, but HTML 5 will solve these problems and hopefully we can stop using flash too.<p>The whole point of the web is that it is a standard environment.  That we can build sites and applications that work for everyone, whether or not their corporation will allow them to install flash or anything else.",1243011406

Fix the interpreter - or just don't use reserved words, or enclose those in quotes if you use them.<p>Everything adds up. Imagine you were sending a few billion JSON objects a day. Requiring quotes on <i>every</i> single property name is wasteful and unnecessary. It's redundant useless information.<p>A hack around would be to regexp a replace to add quotes, and then JSON.parse it, but then you may as well just continue using eval, or a parser that doesn't care if you omit quotes, which is a shame.<p>IMHO, JSON.parse should function exactly as eval does for de-serializing js objects.",1243010945

This is due to both increasing clock frequency and the fact that propagation speed has gone down as feature size decreased.",1243008622

Sakai (<a href=""http://sakaiproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sakaiproject.org/</a>) has the more substantial ""big school"" base, and looks like a good platform on which to build if you're okay with a Java app stack, and willing to put up with some ""design by committee"" architectural choices. Moodle (<a href=""http://moodle.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moodle.org/</a>) on the other hand is much easier to get up and running quickly (it's just a standard PHP app), and has an active community of extension, theme, and patch contributors, albeit at the cost of some of the typical PHP framework's tendency to grow warts.",1243008617

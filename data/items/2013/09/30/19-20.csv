Manual investigation would be triggered.<p>Look into how JavaScript minimizers/obfuscators work.  They could be parsing your code down to a form where your variable names and comments don&#x27;t matter at all.

6471929,comment,6467130,6469655,1,0,lsc,,,"Hah.  I thought I was giving a lot of credit to it being 1997.    I mean, that was kinda the central point to my post.  I&#x27;d have been in bad shape if I ended up looking for work with no experience in 2001.<p>>However I can tell you right here that if I had started out looking in 2001? I would have been fucked.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say it wasn&#x27;t a self-absorbed comment...  I was speaking from experience.  A lot of time I try to stick to direct knowledge in my writing... which /is/ self-absorbed, but in some ways, I think, is less offensive, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m writing about things I know (which is to say, myself and my experiences.)  rather than spouting off about people I don&#x27;t know anything about.<p>Edit:<p>The problem, I think, isn&#x27;t anything cultural having to do with young men;  the problem, I think, is simply low demand for labor.   Shifting people around so that they can do different sorts of labor, sure, could be really good for the people in question, however, I don&#x27;t think it would really solve the problem.   There is simply more people of working age than there is demand for labor right now.    Yes, there&#x27;s demand for top-end computer folks... but for the bottom half of computer folks?  yeah, still not so much demand.<p>This is the primary reason why I think it&#x27;s not particularly productive to focus on group X or Y.   With demand as it is, /someone/ is going to be unemployed;  I think that societal effort is better focused on getting demand up in general vs. focusing on helping one group (potentially at the expense of others.)<p>Something needs to change this low demand.   I don&#x27;t know what that something is.  Perhaps Entrepreneurs need to focus on finding new ways to profit from human labor?  perhaps the government needs to spend money on WPA-style infrastructure projects that use a lot of labor?   I don&#x27;t know.   Seems to me like we need the former solution for it to stick long-term, but the latter is often put forward as a way to jump-start that sort of thing.    (Or maybe we do need a kind of government work-corps long-term, that do the sort of infrastructure work that private industry won&#x27;t, and that employ many laborers?)<p>Going back to being self-absorbed:  one thing I notice is that my local Safeway (the rivermark in santa clara)  is always really busy, and always has a 5+ person line.   There are plenty more checkout lanes, they are just empty.   It&#x27;s a fairly wealthy neighborhood, full of computer types.  Why doesn&#x27;t safeway bump their prices by a percent or so and hire a few more local kids to man some of the idle registers?<p>Something is wrong there, and I don&#x27;t know what it is.  It&#x27;s possible that there is a cost to firing folks at safeway that I don&#x27;t see. [1]  It&#x27;s also possible that my neighbors are more price sensitive than I think... but it&#x27;s the only serious grocery store for miles, and the lot is always crowded with newish luxury vehicles.  Fry&#x27;s handles the same problem (varying levels of checkout demand)   fairly well.  When they get busy, they quickly put more folks on the register.  The check-out line moves quickly all the time; when it&#x27;s busy, they just have more registers open.<p>(but yeah.  Talk about self-absorbed.  &quot;Oh no, I have to wait 10 minutes to buy my grass-fed beef,  either that or drive 20 minutes to the whole foods, something is terribly wrong!  I chuckled.)<p>[1]From what I&#x27;ve seen?  the legal costs, unemployment, etc... don&#x27;t explain the reluctance to fire people.  I think there is a high social cost to firing folks because of this.  It&#x27;s possible that corporations are hesitant to respond to spikes in demand by hiring folks.   Perhaps we need a &#x27;temporary employee&#x27; category to set expectations?  but...  seasonal employers work that out under the current scheme, so why can&#x27;t Safeway?   I mean, population and demand, in silicon valley, might as well be seasonal (though, our seasons last half a decade)  It&#x27;s also possible that large corporations have firing costs that are simply way higher than small corporations;  I really only have direct knowledge when it comes to the small shops.",1380570969

Never had a problem.<p>I remember a couple of years ago the guy that came to the Bay Area for the google interview and stopped in to see someone in Oakland the night before and was shot dead.  Or, the old man that was killed by someone on the street hitting him so hard.  Or, the kid that was paralyzed while getting a music lesson because some shot off a gun during a robbery.<p>In the past, the crime in the bad areas of Oakland didn&#x27;t bleed out to the nicer areas.  I predicted this after the 2008 crash.  I knew once the economy crashed, it wouldn&#x27;t take long for the very large numbers of uneducated, jobless, young men in the bad parts of Oakland to realize their meal ticket was walking around in the nicer areas of town.  Piedmont, surrounded on all sides by Oakland, has been hit by an increase in robberies, many of which are home invasion style.  I was talking with a friend the other day who knows a lawyer that is defending some of the people in the gang (Easy Money Team... what a name, but it gives you insight into their thinking).  They&#x27;re all 14-20ish, with parents about 14 yrs or so older than them.<p>There is a lack of opportunity, but the black community needs to address some of their problems, at least one of which is cultural: it is uncool for kids to succeed through academics, it is very cool for kids to succeed via sports or rap music or dancing.  Until it is cool to do well in school, and that starts with the parents, this problem will only get worse.<p>For those that want to label me a racist: there are studies that back up what I said.  There was a prominent researcher that died recently, but not before writing a scathing article about this problem.  There was an article about him and his research in the East Bay Express.

I&#x27;d consider many of my friends and peers geniuses, and their talents astound me consistently.<p>What I meant more so was that government policy seems to be pushing Irish innovation into a corner, while cheerleading a &#x27;knowledge economy&#x27; that probably doesn&#x27;t jive with our ideas of what a knowledge economy is. You only have to look at the recent reductions in the wage-floor for importing tech workers, on a fast-track visa scheme, from outside the EU, to see what I mean. If we had a thriving tech sector then why are wages stagnant? Why did Sean O Sullivan bleat on about needing to issue, what was it, 15k visas to non-EU people per year? We have a <i>massive</i> EU wide workforce, with massive unemployment and masses of graduates graduating each year. A significant number of STEM grads leave the industry because they can&#x27;t find work, and yet we don&#x27;t have enough workers? And if we don&#x27;t have enough workers then why do they need to lower the wage floor for importing people? Shouldn&#x27;t wages be rising?<p>Government policy is purposely driving wages down. Jobbridge internships have been extended to 18 months, and I fear for the effect that this is going to have on the country, in terms of brain-drain for graduates, and general morale.<p>It sounds like you guys all feel good about our tech sector. I&#x27;m glad, because as well as the above, all i&#x27;ve heard for the last 10 years is how terrible our graduates are, and how companies are annoyed that they have to spend money bringing people in from elsewhere. This isn&#x27;t true of course, they don&#x27;t have to, it&#x27;s just part of the same &#x27;we only want geniuses&#x27; narrative that&#x27;s taking place in the US and elsewhere, which is handily also stagnating wages. I could link to probably 50 interviews and articles (if i had enough time) from CEO&#x27;s of Havok, Demonware, Paypal, Google etc etc saying how poor our country is for talent, and whether you feel good about our tech sector, the statements coming from our indigenous companies, and MNC&#x27;s, don&#x27;t make me feel good.<p>So i&#x27;d suggest that if the sector is thriving, it&#x27;s in spite of our culture, political climate (except for corporation tax), and whatever else, rather than being a thing that was destined to happen.<p>Anyway nevermind that, if anyone has any more suggestions for meetups, i&#x27;d love to hear them.

May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza&#x27;s Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.[19]</i>&quot; //<p>I don&#x27;t think it does justice to Einstein&#x27;s beliefs to say &quot;&#x27;he was an agnostic&#x27; and that&#x27;s all&quot;. For example the statement - though I&#x27;ve not looked at the wider context - that:<p>>&quot;[...] Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it [...] is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity&quot; Einstein &quot;Ideas and Opinions&quot; (1954), NY, Bonanza Books [via Wikipedia]<p>seems quite contrary to Bertrand Russell&#x27;s position of whom it could equally be said &#x27;he was an agnostic and that&#x27;s all&#x27;.",1380570274

On the radio side, bluetooth LE solved that problem for us. Since we are sending data in bursts and the amount of data transferred is so little, the radio power consumption is almost negligible. We also use an ultra low power micro-controller with intelligent power management to low power consumption when the lock is not in use. The biggest power sucker was the mechanical actuation system. So that became more of a mechanical design and engineering problem. Using a solenoid was our of equation. There are extremely inefficient. We design the lock so that the actuator movement is minimal and is driven by a very low power motor. However there was one last issue. Most of the off-the-shelf batteries leak energy and deplete even if you are not using them after a 1-2 years. We are now using an advance lithium battery technology that has a very high energy density as well as very low leakage rate (This technology is commonly used to power sensors in remote sensing and telemetry application)<p>Eventually when the battery level drops low after a few years, you can notification on your phone and you can then replace the battery.",1380569675

When we apply the term loosely like that we aren&#x27;t just applying a term carelessly.  When we do that, we are attributing all the past crimes that we associate with that name to the people that we are calling &quot;Al Quaeda&quot;, whether they had any involvement in those past crimes or not.  We are further creating a situation where &quot;Al Quaeda&quot; can appear from nothingness, with no connection to previous &quot;Al Quaeda&quot;.<p>Hypothetical example of why I think this is dangerous: If we (for whatever reason) invade Malaysia, and Malaysian Muslims start shooting at us because we have invaded their country.  The moment we apply the <i>&quot;Muslim who shoots at us?  that is Al Quaeda&quot;</i> logic, those Malaysian Muslims then, in the eyes of the general public, inherit the crimes of Al Quaeda (say, 9/11).  All of a sudden we aren&#x27;t in Malaysia for &quot;whatever reason&quot;, but because those darned Al Quaeda <i>(you know, those &quot;9/11 guys&quot;)</i> are there, and they must pay for their crimes.",1380569182

Instead, the Schwarzschild radius of a (potential) black hole is proportional to total mass. That means that as you increase its mass, the actual radius of a sphere of constant density grows only as m^(1/3) while its Schwarzschild grows much faster as m^1.<p>Thus, as you pile up more and more of your identical 1cc cubes, the size of the pile will grow more slowly than the size of its Schwarzschild radius. As soon as you add enough cubes for the Schwarzschild radius to exceed the actual radius, the system must inevitably form a black hole.<p>I <i>think</i> that this behavior is directly related to the information density limits that we&#x27;ve been talking about, but certainly the end result is the same: piling up lots of similar stuff in one place will eventually lead to gravitational collapse.",1380568617

The original design only considered documents in one static use case, a desktop browser.

Both happened in broad daylight, in heavily trafficked areas with people around. I was unable to assist OPD with the former case, but for the latter I ran down to give a statement. OPD never caught them last I heard, the car hasn&#x27;t been recovered, and an elderly couple was very shaken.<p>I get the feeling that some elements inside OPD are trying to help the public, while others are cops for the power trip (see the Riders case of the early 2000&#x27;s). OPD is absolutely stretched thin, but they are that way because Oakland is a big city and the command structure has previously had major run-ins with the DoJ (see Riders again) and therefore is very very careful about putting officers on the street. More so, they keep having issues with the DoJ (See Occupy Oakland, Scott Olsen), going so far as to the DoJ throwing down a threat of having the force taken over and reorganized, what would be a first for any organization in the US. We can&#x27;t even keep a police chief for more then a few months, or days for that matter. Howard Jordan was around from 2011 until earlier this year. A day or two before another DoJ ruling/meeting, he suddenly retired due to a &quot;medical condition&quot;, which he still hasn&#x27;t disclosed. His replacement, Anthony Toribio, only lasted 2 days. Days. Not months. Days. The current interim chief, Sean Whent is still around, but we will see how much longer. We only have 637 officers as of last check. 637 for a town of 400,000 people.<p>Oakland has a broken government, including OPD and other services. It caused all of it&#x27;s own problems, mostly due to OPD. Oakland won&#x27;t get better until crime gets better or people start caring more about Oakland. I love my city, but I can&#x27;t do much to help, other than helping the community (see OaklandWiki.org).<p>Maybe this is rambling, but whatever, it&#x27;s out there.

This is the second essay I&#x27;ve seen recently that seems to completely miss the magic of our trade, and I feel like we need some strong cheerleaders to counter this stuff.<p>How does a programmer NOT wake up every morning with a head full of inspired, flaming joy at the thought of what we do for a living?  I&#x27;ve been at this for 5 years now (putting me in the same generation as OP, and the other blogger I came across) and I&#x27;m still ragingly in love with this craft.  And I (_just_, you might say) write web apps.  Yes, there are tedious days (we are, as many have stated WORKING, after all).  And yes, sometimes the nature of constantly shifting specs leads us into some ugly code - but that&#x27;s the nature of writing and designing to meet the needs of customers; sometimes customers really just NEED something that isn&#x27;t very pretty.<p>But the root of what we do is this: we conjure ideas from memory and imagination, commit them into words and incantations in the terminal, and send out our instructions to be carried out by the machine.  Making our will manifest through a medium that is almost completely malleable to our intentions.  If there&#x27;s another trade out there that&#x27;s more nakedly similar to &quot;wizard&quot; I&#x27;d love to hear about it.  What we do is barely-adulterated magic.  And there is so much room for improvisation, art, and beauty in the crafting of our instructions, that even a simple CRUD interface can become a work of glory.<p>I freely admit that, in my enthusiasm, I&#x27;m sounding a bit deranged.  And I&#x27;m painting this in a bit more glowing light than most day-to-day coding deserves.  But it pains me to see a programmer with such a negative outlook on programming.  And when that view gets touted as a warning against being a coder, I feel those of us who really and truly enjoy our trade need to be standing up and making the counter-argument - with all the ardor and enthusiasm it deserves.<p>Addendum: and OK, so the OP may not be making the claim that &quot;programming&quot; itself isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s the JOB that&#x27;s bad.  It&#x27;s writing the code that our clients need, day-in, day-out, that&#x27;s bad.  My counter-claim to that: writing bad code is a choice.  You can look at every problem that comes to you as &quot;just more toilet cleaning&quot;, or you can look for the aspects of the problem that separate it from all the code you&#x27;ve written before, and start writing the correct, clean, elegant response to it.  And if you&#x27;re solving the same problem a second time, well it ought to be that much easier than before, right?  If you solved the problem PROPERLY the first time, there should be very little work in solving it a SECOND time.  So now you find yourself getting paid to do less work, while - hopefully -leaving yourself room to more fully commoditize whatever process you&#x27;ve found yourself on, making it easier to KEEP getting paid while doing less and less work each time.  With your remaining time, you solve OTHER problems, and continue filling the pipeline with magic and money.<p>Seeing the job as tedious and boring starts as a choice you make yourself.  Getting back the magic you felt in your youth is just a matter of remembering it; and choosing to see it in the next project that hits your inbox.",1380567802

Not so much on desktop browsers nowadays, but in mobile very much.",1380567689

This has helped me manage my anxiety on a day to day basis, and the worrying I used to suffer during the day have definitely calmed down. However, for the last 2 months I have been falling apart when I have been trying to go to sleep. I have been very at peace with myself, incredibly happy but then as soon as my head hits the pillow I get incredibly bad physical symptoms - intense chest pains, palpitations and this incredible feeling of adrenaline being pumped around my body - as though I have just been mugged or scared.<p>I have seen my doctor and physically everything is fine - my bloodwork is in perfect order and I am a non drinker, smoker and not in any way obese.<p>This is beginning to really effect me - I am getting no sleep and because I am getting no sleep my anxiety during the day is becoming worse and my work is suffering. I am struggling to keep going at the moment as I am just so exhausted. Even if I do get to sleep, I suddenly wake with the symptoms I described above.<p>As I say, I feel as though I am happy - good job, nice partner, nice home, no real worries to speak of but it is though my body has a phobia of going up to the bedroom to try and get some sleep.<p>What I desperately need, and what my councillor is not giving me, is ideas on how to: \n1. Stop the pains from coming on in the first place (vary bed times, put film on in the background, meditate before bed etc). \n2. When the pains do kick in, how to then manage those so they don&#x27;t take over. At the moment, the first sign of a pain and I panic myself into thinking that I am going to get zero sleep.<p>If anyone has any advice or tips (no matter how stupid!), or reading that I can do/meditation techniques - anything - then I would be most grateful if you can share these with me. Thanks!",1380567679

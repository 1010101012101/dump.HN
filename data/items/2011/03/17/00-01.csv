Two minutes later, I open up my inbox, and I start receiving messages from women wanting me to go to MySpace to talk to them.

It seems that each app is simply running on one or more of it's own EC2 instances with the smallest plans (free tier and the smallest paid plan) running on micro instances.  Those micro instances are horrible (generally slow, terrible I/O) and for the monthly fee they are charging, there are much better options.  That probably explains why they only give one free app for the entire account, it would be too expensive to provide more than one free micro instance for everyone.  Though I haven't been impressed by the AWS micro instances, PHP Fog apparently has an option to run on Rackspace cloud which is much better for the low end IMO.<p>Heroku doesn't put your applications on their own instances.  I imagine they are also getting around the problem of crap low end EC2 instances by distributing all apps across clusters of the largest instances.<p>Not to bag on PHP Fog, they have created a lot of excitement in the PHP space.

The presumption that knowledge of the nature of the danger and the geographical boundaries of the exclusion zone will be preserved and passed on to future generations for the entire duration that the area remains a danger to human health is rather dubious.  History is riddled with examples of ancient civilizations whose secrets are lost to us.  As members of the technical elite of our society, we tend to implicitly assume that knowledge will be preserved and technological progress will continue in an unbroken chain, but that doesn't necessarily make it so.

I think the lesson is that you need to work hard to educate your user to get it to catch on.  Think of specific killer use cases.  I would recommend going to the nearest business school during interview season and posting a bunch of flyers that say something like ""We'll call you when you get the email that's going to change your life"".  Maybe target med school applicants similarly, anyone who's checking their email every 5 minutes waiting for the big one.  Don't target developers, they already know how to forward emails to text message.  This is also the easiest to monetize without charging.  If people give you 5 email addresses, the domains may well give you insight into what they care about most.  Targeting advertising rocket fuel (applying to Goldman, are we?).",1300321947

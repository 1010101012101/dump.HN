269661,comment,269574,269574,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Having failed a couple papers in educational theory classes for proposing vaguely similar ideas, I'll give you the standard criticism: How does this maximize the child's intrinsic motivation to learn? Which isn't the same question as 'will this be fun,' which you make the case for. But rather, will this make kids the kind of people who want to check out non-fiction books from the library on their own ten years from now.",1218121106

This has gotten a pretty positive response so far, and has the added advantage of being very difficult to duplicate, giving you a big competitive edge.<p>Not sure how this could be applied to subjects other than language, and doing it for language is hard enough, but that's what makes this an interesting problem. :)<p>Also, I've dug around quite a bit, and talked to a few other researchers, and have yet to find any proper studies on the effectiveness of SuperMemo algorithm itself.  There are lots of testimonials, but nothing involving a control group, and so until I see some hard data, I'm going to remain a little skeptical.<p>If anybody knows of such a study (with associated data), please let me know.<p>Of course, since I'm building a learning system, this puts me in a good position to undertake such an experiment. <i>grin</i>  Which I plan to do next semester, using a few hundred students' worth of Japanese classes.",1218120942
269658,comment,267298,267315,0,0,Retric,,,"Summary:
Apple options are horribly overpriced.
Dell XPS laptops are overpriced and are similar in price to Apple systems.<p>I spent a few years developing OS 8,9, and X Software back when OS X was new.  I used a dual G4 and upgraded to a G5.  I honestly don't miss OS X it's just an OS and their hardware is expensive in useless ways.  If your building a 3k system use 8GB of ram not 2 Xeon chips and 95% of the time you will be happy you did.  I am currently using a  3 month old 1200$ dell and its fast enough that I just don't notice any issues.  If I would upgrade anything I would spend ~2k on better displays a long time before I upgraded my computer.<p>PS: Granted some people might be CPU bound and happy with 2GB of ram but that’s got to be a tiny fraction of the market.",1218120794

269643,comment,269585,269585,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Good article with a lot of good points, but I was put off by this quote:<p>""[UI Design] is not something every programmer can learn. Most programmers don’t have any aptitude for UI design whatsoever. It’s an art, and like any art, it requires innate ability. You can learn to be a better writer. You can learn to be a better illustrator. But most people can’t write and can’t draw, and no amount of practice or education is going to make them good at it. Improved, yes; good, no.""<p>I get his point, but saying that everyone who isn't a natural {writer, illustrator, programmer, UI designer} will never be good is a slap in the face to everyone who's ever worked hard enough to get good at something (including the naturals).  I think the ""naturals"" are the people who care enough to work, practice, think, and generally dedicate themself to becoming great.",1218119492

269638,comment,269232,269232,0,0,thedob,,,"The whole key to this idea will end up being the music, and not the 'getting paid for downloading the music.' If the site does a good job of promoting quality artists who you may have never discovered otherwise, then that's reason alone to buy Popcuts. When a band gets big, people will buy the music off of ITunes anyway, but if Popcuts identifies a quality band early, then it saves hours of internet search and digging to find good new stuff. And that's something worth paying .99 for.",1218118527

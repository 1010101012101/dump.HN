Let's talk about why this is a shitty conclusion.<p>1. This study was looking at protein markers on cells that were aspirated out of stomach masses and comparing the results to the pathology report. This thinking completely discounts the other actor in the scenario, the gastroenterologist who is doing the aspiration by endoscopy. If you give me a sample with cancer, I'm going to report it. However, the GI doc has to sample it and he has to give me a decent sample to work with. If he does not biopsy your cancer, I can't call it. I don't practice faith-based medicine. The thing is though, I spend a not-insignificant portion of my days in procedures just like this immediately assessing the material (looking at it under the microscope) and can tell the GI if he is sampling the material, or if it is enough for us to make the diagnosis. He usually knows if it is cancer before I leave the room (and it is a lot shorter than even 60 minutes).<p>2. This small device has detected a single type of cancer in pre-screened patients, that is patients who have a reason to have this done (maybe they're just having a little stomach pain, or maybe they've been vomiting blood and have had a 20 pound weight loss in the past 3 months). Try screening the general population and let me know how your device fares. It is not portable. It required an entire endoscopy suite, expensive endoscopy equipment, and a highly trained (multiple years of clinical fellowship) operator. You ain't gonna pull this off in a rural village in Africa (and let's face, what's the point of that, you don't have anything to treat it with). Plus you were directly sampling the tumor mass with a needle. I do this all damn day! I don't really have much problem calling cancer, or even better, telling docs that masses are benign if someone is able to stick a needle in something. Wake me up when you can diagnose any form of cancer by sampling tumor cells circulating in the peripheral blood (actually we are probably closer to that than you think!).<p>3. For lesions of the stomach, aspirating the lesion is a shitty way to make the diagnosis. Forceps biopsy is a much better way and that is the way this type of cancer is going to be diagnosed in the vast majority of patients. So if you are already there with your endoscopy, just get a goddamn biopsy already.",1298667405

Think of having a Thunderbolt connector on your laptop but then also in your monitor at home. The monitor has an USB EHCI, a SATA HBA, etc to support a bunch of integrated USB ports and maybe an eSATA connector or two. You get home, connect your laptop to your monitor via Thunderbolt, and new USB and SATA adapters appear in your laptop's PCIe configuration.<p>Thunderbolt is more of an external PCIe bus than a peripheral bus like USB.

This matches my experience a lot, and it's interesting that this is one level below O notation but one level above ""counting how many operations should happen, roughly"", which is what you have to do in practice to make algorithmic code go fast.<p>2. The examples around which an intro to CS course is structured are really uninteresting. I couldn't agree more, and never cared for computing factorial, fibonacci, etc, or for writing silly games or dumb data-processing programs; Simulations and numeric algorithms are far more interesting, and can get students interested more easily when they realize that other classes' work can be made far easier with computers.<p>3. Everyone should know CS. Even my philosophy-major wife often has the need to run short scripts to automate some tasks, and I think that if a philosophy major can benefit from CS concepts anyone else should as well.<p>All these things one should find out eventually, and I agree that exposing people to these concepts as soon as possible is a very good idea, far better than what is usually taught as CS-for-non-CS-majors.",1298665437

The first of these is concerned with mathematical structures that are tantalizingly close (or identical) to data structure that we often use. These can be represented as algebraic expressions and converted into related or equivalent ones using simple operations from algebra and calculus. F&S exhibit the tools necessary for analyzing the properties of these structures, using complex analysis, the same tools used to get a grip on ""ordinary"" algebraic expressions. It turns out these tools can help predict the performance of algorithms or help generate large random data structures for testing or statistical analysis.<p>We are used to the strong connections between type theory and mathematical logic, and here we see something that looks like types being manipulated with algebra!<p>To me the trend is this: CS will benefit in the future from borrowing more and more design patterns from math.

Since a few years for you might be tens of millions of years elsewhere. There is also little matter between galaxies, so the hyper velocity particles problem would be less severe. Still total sci fi from where we are sitting, just saying that once you approach c distances shrink a lot (relative to your frame of reference). So if travel close to c is possible at all, travel almost anywhere is possible.<p>This is one of the reasons the Fermi paradox is so interesting. There are tons of possible explanations. One simple one in this context is, of course, that accelerating to speeds that close to light is just physically impossible for various reasons. This would at least limit migration to nearby interstellar distances at best, which when combined with other factors would make intelligences encountering one another statistically rare in the universe.<p>There was a sci fi book where a ship&#x27;s Bussard Ramjet got stuck in the &quot;on&quot; position and they kept accelerating until time dilation allowed them to survive a great crunch and another Big Bang. By the time they stopped they were in a new universe.",1422503867

As a result, we just straight up aren&#x27;t using most of what Slack is great at, and we probably never will.<p>If they offered a paid tier for just extending the number of integrations available, I think it would quickly become far more useful to my team, but none of the rest of the paid features are of any use to any of the teams I&#x27;m on at all. I get that I&#x27;m probably not the target market, but I would wager that whatever those two extra integrations would cost them to provide us, our team would be able to pay and then some.",1422503861

Unfortunately, a large quantity of dicks (literally) in SV think that operations positions are cookie cutter and can be filled by anyone hungry for a job. I can assure you from first hand experience that&#x27;s not the case, and have seen many a company encounter additional struggles because they lacked (or lost) the operations support to keep the team together in hard times.<p>Operation&#x27;s positions are primarily filled by women.  Women who work their asses off to keep the rest of the company fed when they are in crunch time. Women who ensure the office is warm, friendly and receptive to creative work. Women who make sure the ADD CEO is where they need to be on time to make deals happen. Women who understand the business better than most of the executives, because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s required to be good at helping the executives to get their shit together and get stuff done.<p>And, sadly, these women doing operations are paid a fraction of what men are in other equally critical roles.

8964172,comment,8962896,8964050,0,0,fryguy,,,"The reason it is costly, is because it needs to be costly (sorry for the circular logic). ~3600 Bitcoin is given away each day to miners, which means that rational actors in the mining network are going to be able to spend that same amount in power on mining (~1M USD). That money is put into the Bitcoin network, as prevention of some kind of exploits on the blockchain. An attacker would need to spend that much in order to be able to fork the blockchain for any period of time.<p>As far as why it needs to have no benefit, the main reason is that the state of the blockchain needs to be transferred into a hard problem of some kind in order for the proof-of-work to work. You can think of each attempt at solving it is a &quot;vote&quot; for that particular version of the blockchain. If everyone could vote very fast on their own particular version of the blockchain, then it would very quickly pollute the bitcoin network, and consensus would be very difficult to achieve. If, instead each vote could be scored some way (randomly), and only one out of every thousand one of your votes for the state of the blockchain is broadcast to the bitcoin network, then that means it&#x27;s going to be much less polluted, and much easier to come to some kind of consensus. By being random, the fact that you are able to send a vote at one out of every thousand, means that each vote really represents 1000 votes. This is how bitcoin works, but the thousand is a much larger number (200,000,000,000,000,000,000).<p>In the naive implementation, the proof of work could be done by having a function f(x) producing a number in [0, 1) based on x (and f is irreversible), and then submitting votes that are below/above some threshold. Suppose f is the protein folding problem, and f(x) is some energy on how well you folded it (I don&#x27;t really know how folding works, but bear with me). The problem with this is you could sit in your basement for several weeks and solve a bunch of these problems, and then all at once use them to fork the blockchain by having several blocks that have a proof of work assigned. This means that the work that&#x27;s being done needs to be related to the state of the blockchain that you&#x27;re voting on somehow. Another way, is that there needs to be a function w : b -> f where b is the blockchain state that you are voting on, and it produces f. In bitcoin, this w function is the merkle tree of all the transactions in it, and f is sha2(sha2(blockheader with the merkle tree and x)). This step is what makes it very difficult to &quot;do actual work&quot; when mining, since it&#x27;s hard to make a hard problem that is dependent on random data, that&#x27;s actually useful.",1422502537

possess. One should not obstruct access to such a vital tool.&quot;</i><p>Maybe it turned out that practical evidence has shown that lazy evaluation wasn&#x27;t as important for modularity as Hughes thought, or at least that its drawbacks have been found unacceptable in practice?",1422501527

The gist of it is this: your first 100 users will be completely different from your last 10,000. The first 100 have to be courted - you&#x27;re going to have to bend over backwards to make them happy. If that means customer support emails from the founder, so what? Those first 100 users, the ones who are overwhelmed by your support, will be the most valuable customers you&#x27;ll get, because once they&#x27;re through the door, network effects can really start to kick in.<p>The apocryphal story I&#x27;ve heard (but never verified) is of how PayPal broke out in the eBay marketplace. Instead of trying to convert customers with advertising and the like, they pretended to be customers on eBay, offering to buy inexpensive items from popular sellers before asking if the sellers accepted PayPal. This got the first few sellers through the door, and once they started using it the network effects propagated through eBay and beyond, turning PayPal into the giant it is today.<p>Hope this helps.

However, LSD has a ""speedy"" side-effect which kind of puts you in a good mood as you get higher, whereas shrooms usually have the opposite - a slight feeling of malaise centered around your stomach, which can help start your trip badly.<p>That said, I agree that starting easy is a good idea.",1240818932

You may think reality is something tangible, reliable, objective... what you find after a psychedelic trip is that actually, things can be otherwise, and all you need is a few micrograms of a simple molecule. Considering that your brain manufactures enormous amounts of other chemicals, that should raise questions about quite what this ""reality"" thing is and how much it can be trusted.<p>Worth adding: those are good questions, worth asking.",1240818724

581013,comment,580981,581004,0,0,swombat,,,"The first piece of advice is good. Do it in a safe environment you control, ideally with someone else who has already taken psychedelics before. Oh, and make sure you <i>both</i> take psychedelics, at the same time. Otherwise you might get a bad trip form feeling paranoid about them.<p>The second piece of advice is only useful if you want to give him a reason to freak out and have a bad trip. LSD is one of the safest mind-altering drugs around. As far as I know the chances of it triggering psychosis based on a single dose, a single time, are pretty much nil. Regular users might go nuts, but then anyone who spends a significant portion of their life on LSD is pretty much nuts to begin with.",1240818519

581005,comment,580981,580981,0,0,mlLK,,,"Generally speaking, psychoactive drugs will radically alter your <i>state</i>. Your state will scale according to your mood and well-being. If you trip with a group of people in a good mood and adventurous spirit you will have a great trip. On the other hand, if you are tripping with a group of individuals who are emotionally unstable or generally prejudice towards new experiences, don't do it.<p>As a rule of thumb, do it with people you're comfortable around and would trust with your life, pick a controlled environment, stay positive, be curious, and mentally prepare yourself for a ride you will never forget.<p>Otherwise, test-drive some psyclocibin (shrooms) first, as it is a much more mild psychedelic.",1240818053

The risks are real, and experts are still divided over how much long term damage can be done even from one experience.<p>One tab is a mild dose in the range of LSD dosages, it is likely to be 1/4th the strength of one unit of LSD from the hippie era. The risks are indeed real but are overstated. Flashbacks as discussed in DARE are effectively nonexistent and are a symptom of PTSD. It takes a monster of a trip to trigger PTSD. The greater, somewhat realistic risk is triggering latent mental illness.",1240817769

A physical system can either:<p>1) Be sufficiently large that quantum effects are irrelevant, like a billiard ball, and thus it can be modeled deterministically inside of a computer. The Tegmark paper proposes this is how the brain works.<p>2) Rely on quantum mechanical effects (which are non-deterministic, but can still be simulated inside a computer if you trust a computer's opinion of ""random""). Penrose, Searle, etc. would argue otherwise, that there's a method to the madness, and that there's something ""special"" about the quantum mechanical effect on microtubules. We still don't understand quantum mechanics very well, so if human consciousness really relies on quantum mechanics, there is arguably a bit of wiggle room here, especially if you're a physicist of the same caliber as Penrose.<p>Microtubules are specifically of interest because they're one of the few brain structures small enough to arguably be subject to quantum mechanical events.<p>Tegmark argues that they're not small enough and that it's irrelevant.<p>The real question is:<p>Is it <i>possible</i> to simulate a brain within a computer?<p>- not -<p>Is it really hard? Is it too hard for modern technology? Is this problem simply too complex for us to understand? Do we lack the technology to build sufficient understanding today? Etc. Etc.<p>This article is claiming it's IMPOSSIBLE to simulate a brain within a computer. Proving that is a tall order.",1361253558
5242881,comment,5241977,5241977,13,0,jimmytucson,,,"This article points to a real problem in our society but the scope of it is much larger than just African-Americans or just drug-related crimes.<p>I know because many of the kids I grew up with (including one very close family member of mine) were convicted of felonies and sentenced to anywhere from 1.5 to 12 years in a federal penitentiary.  Of the 9-or-10-some-odd kids I know who did time, less than half of them have gone on to lead normal, productive lives.  Many of them are back in prison now.  Bureau of Justice Statistics back up my experience.  If you are a male between the ages of 14 and 17 who is convicted of a violent felony, your chances of getting re-arrested are better than 80% [1].<p>So, why is this?  Well, in my opinion, based on countless conversations I've had with these individuals and others, it's practically unfathomable that any of them actually succeed in going ""straight"".<p>It's not rocket science.  Imagine you're 17 years old.  You've been hanging out with the wrong crowd, doing drugs, getting into trouble, and leading a scumbag lifestyle since you were 15 or 16.  You get charged with a violent felony, tried as an adult, convicted, and sentenced to 5 years in a maximum security prison (where you get to meet and hang out with a plethora of other gang bangers, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers).<p>Now picture this.  You make parole after 3 years.  You're 20.  You've got no high school diploma, no college credits, no work experience, no car, no money, and the only friends you had who aren't currently either 1) in jail or 2) about to be in jail are juniors and seniors in college and probably studying abroad in Asia or something while you're living at home trying to figure out what to do with your life.  3 of the most formative years of your young adult life have essentially been obliterated.<p>What are you going to do?  After striking out at 5 or 6 other local establishments, McDonald's just became the latest to turn down your application (you have to tell them if you've been convicted of a felony and if you don't they'll find out when they do the background check).  You might have earned your GED while you were in prison but the prospect of getting that pre-law degree you sorta once dreamed is looking pretty slim.  What would be the point, anyway?  You're not allowed to pass the bar exam.  Maybe you should join the military.  Oh, wait... they don't want scumbags like you carrying around an assault rifle.<p>Remember your codefendants?  One of them lives right downstairs.  He wants to know if you feel like ""chilling"" later.  He just got an ounce of cocaine from one of his buddies and there's still a ton of beer left over from that party he had last night.  Fuck it, you're not getting anything done in the next 24 hours, anyway.  You're bored.  You might be embarrassed to admit it, but you're lonely.  Might as well crack open a cold one and try to forget your problems for a spell...<p>See, when you get convicted and sentenced, you may only serve 15 months in prison but you will be a felon for the rest of your life.  And if you got arrested in high school then you don't have any ""former life"" to go back to.  You are not educated.  You have no friends.  You are not hire-able.  You do not have the right to vote.  You cannot serve in our military.  They're practically begging you to fuck up again.<p>And, unfortunately, most of them do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/rpr94.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/rpr94.pdf</a>",1361253518

5242872,comment,5242381,5242631,12,0,xyzzy123,,,"OK, so the link you provided is a gross simplification of current thinking. Government officials have been quite clear that CNE[1] is NOT generally considered an act of war, rather, it's part of the usual intelligence operations expected during peacetime.<p>It's CNA (e.g. operations designed specifically to disrupt or destroy civilian or military targets) which is ""on the table"" for act-of-war status, particularly if there is kinetic effect. An example would be if something like Stuxnet were deployed against the U.S. power grid.<p>The idea is that it doesn't matter whether a power plant was  disabled via a bomb or a backdoor. Both the intent and the outcome are the same. So the declaration of policy you linked to is really a clarification rather than a ""change of course"".<p>The lines are blurry when it comes to CNE and critical infrastructure. The problem you have is that if, say, 3 competing agencies are all vying for control of the same powerplant for CNE reasons (e.g. not <i>trying</i> to cause damage), the plant might nonetheless get taken out by accident. I'm not sure anyone is clear on what to do in that kind of a situation.<p>[1] We can divide ""cyber"" operations into the following categories (straight from wikipedia):<p>* Computer Network Attack (CNA): Includes actions taken via computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the information within computers and computer networks and/or the computers/networks themselves.<p>* Computer Network Defense (CND): Includes actions taken via computer networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect and respond to network attacks, intrusions, disruptions or other unauthorized actions that would compromise or cripple defense information systems and networks. Joint Pub 6.0 further outlines Computer Network Defense as an aspect of NetOps<p>* Computer Network Exploitation (CNE): Includes enabling actions and intelligence collection via computer networks that exploit data gathered from target or enemy information systems or networks.",1361253347

5242869,comment,5241977,5242648,2,0,kamaal,,,">>5 years is a very, very long time and if we actually made an effort to rehabilitate you could teach a person a ton in 5 years.<p>Rehabilitation and reformation is a two way traffic and for that two way traffic to work a lot has to click at once.<p>Frankly speaking a lot of people can be reformed, especially the poor ones or people coming from poor families. Or people who commit crime in a impulse or fit of sudden rage(Who as a matter of fact are not criminals at all). For such people a term called 'justice to the victim' mandates a certain term of 'punishment'. I think the same term must be used to rehabilitate and reform the person.<p>Now the problem is something like this. The prisoner needs to be convinced that he can make a living out of every day work. Which is difficult- you have to go and out and really find a way a prisoner can achieve that, then the prisoner has to be himself willing to undergo a change to get into the new world. This is a ideal scenario.<p>Jail reforms were a thing here in India. To take small time thieves and other petty offenders and reform them so that they could re enter the society was taken. But taking into consideration the trauma of being in a jail, then to be treated like animals and forced to live in sub human conditions. To be in false hope of getting released/out on bail. Then to carry the stigma of society always considering you a criminal and prison inmate at a time.<p>A person will get little time to think about reform and rehabilitation. What a person in that state would go through total devastation, or at most a emotion of relief if he can get to divorce his wife, let them free to live without the burden of being known as attached to a family of a criminal. Hope that his kids can somehow make it through well in the real world.<p>Or worse after spending so much time in the prison a person might get <i>institutionalized</i> to the prison.",1361253241

Legalizing drugs but taxing the dickens out of them removes the huge profit motive from distributors, so you would see less ""marketing"" and fewer unsuspecting people getting addicted in the first place, and licensed distributors would be far less likely to unlawfully target children. Then you can use the tax revenue generated to fund anti-drug programs like the ones that have been relatively successful in reducing cigarette smoking in recent years, to stigmatize drugs use as much as possible socially.<p>And we can make getting drugs very unsexy: Require them to be sold only by licensed pharmacists who are obligated to describe the correct dosage and side effects etc. For hard drugs, require them to be consumed on the seller's premises with a physician present at all times and the user to be attached to medical monitoring equipment.<p>The goal should be to make drug use legal but lame. The problem now is that people don't recognize the risks and costs and foolishly choose to consume dangerous and addictive substances. Make them go talk to a legitimate physician in a lab coat who explains how doing this will cause their teeth to fall out and suddenly the whole idea just seems silly.

However, current disk-based operating systems may perform thousands of File I/O operations per second when performing seemingly trivial tasks - dramatically slowing down the perceived speed of the operating system.  Webapps do not perform thousands of Network I/O operations per second.  Instead, webapp authors go to great lengths to maximize that the perceived performance of the app, even on very slow network connections.  For example, Gmail perform asynchronous background network operations, so the user rarely perceives any sort of network delay - even on a very slow connection.<p>Another significant trade-off of running webapps instead of locally installed application compiled to machine code - webapps are usually written in some combination of Flash, ECMAscript, or HTML5, all of which are much slower than machine code.  However, webapp authors also go to great lengths to insure their apps perform very well, despite the slow language interpreters.<p>In the end if the webapps are written well, they absolutely can run faster than a traditional operating system running local apps.",1361250921

It's considered par for the course these days.  It's not always breaking in to the infrastructure, sometimes it's providing it.<p>For just two well known examples, look at Israel's Mossad-affiliated <i>AMDOCS</i> company's widespread global telecommunications data theft with ""hosted billing solutions"" for major mobile and fixed-line telecommunications carriers worldwide (certainly US and EU-wide).<p>Or, look at the European Union's exposure of how the US has been constantly abusing surveillance capabilities for global geostrategic business purposes in their original report on Echelon; IIRC they had a very well documented case of Airbus vs. Boeing.<p>These things don't stand still, and the above examples are continuing but originated 10+ years ago.<p>IMHO it is now ignorant to believe that we live in anything less than a world of constant conflict where corporate-government mutual assistance and backscratching are the order of the day and citizens rights are nothing more than a quaint, antiquated notion you can easily put down in court given enough lawyers, legal entities, deniability, media gag orders (UK tops the world for these), assassinations (Singapore is up there), imprisonment (US after Wikileaks) or the odd, extreme, resignation.",1361250511

The question, then, is whether it's simpler to write a verifier that simply walks over parse trees or whether it's simpler to write a reader for whatever custom bytecode is defined. I don't think that the verifier is much harder: the JS version of the verifier clocks in at just over 1,000 lines of code [1], which is nothing compared to the size of the VM as a whole. Certainly that 1,000 lines of code doesn't justify breaking backwards compatibility, in my mind.<p>""it would make defining the specification and determining compliance with the standard very straight forward""<p>The specification already more or less exists, and determining compliance is straightforward: 1,000 lines of code for the reference implementation.<p>""it would let us eventually do web programming without being tied to a specific language""<p>asm.js doesn't tie you to a language. On the contrary, it allows you to use alternative languages in order to get better performance than you would if you used normal JavaScript. JS is used as the transport format for backwards compatibility, nothing more. In fact, in SpiderMonkey, asm.js has its own set of IR opcodes (Asm*) that are separate from the JavaScript opcodes.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/dherman/asm.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dherman/asm.js</a>",1361250181

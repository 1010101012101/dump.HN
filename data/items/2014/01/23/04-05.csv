There is one more thing I forgot, however -- there might also be a bias for the 5s in that early adopters (and those who upgrade every year) could be more likely to both own the 5s and have been trained by past iPhones to use as much data as they want. Those who stick with older phones might not use them as often off wi-fi. (Where &quot;as often&quot; is still within reach.) Who knows, though. Perhaps the difference is that the iPhone 5S is easier to unlock, or supports LTE in more places. I&#x27;m sick of guessing, at this point. :)",1390452972

7107030,comment,7106377,7106956,1,0,patcheudor,,,"I think you just hit on a major issue that merchants face when it comes to the PCI DSS.  Many merchants have been wrestling with the scope of PCI DSS compliance for years.  They are looking for easy solutions where unfortunately there are very few. The PCI council has done a very respectable job of creating compliance guides and standards documentation.  However, when it comes to implementation merchants struggle with scope.  If a merchant server as an example responds with a reference to the stripe.js & that code is then executed within the browser context of the merchant domain, is that merchant server in scope for that component?  I believe it is and every QSA (PCI qualified security assessor) I&#x27;ve had this same conversation with has come to that exact same conclusion.  If Stripe consults with their QSA and they come to a different conclusion, then I would hope Stripe would share that publicly with the community.  That would certainly be a ground breaking event for those of us who deal with PCI DSS on a daily basis.<p>In terms of accusation, my goal here is to ensure that Stripe.com and others who are working in this space are being as clear as possible with their communication, that&#x27;s it.  Stripe is going to address statements like the one I pointed out on their site & hopefully as an industry we can get to a point where everyone is a bit more clear on what falls in and out of PCI DSS scope.",1390452537

It is most definitely a win from a user-experience perspective. Even more so... its a win from a developer perspective.<p>A single XML file can serve as a consistent menu across old-style C++ COM programs or even be used in the new .NET / C# programs. You no longer have to worry about resizing icons to the user&#x27;s screen, Ribbons automatically stretch or shrink as necessary.<p>Just from an API perspective, they are far more powerful and consistent way to communicate between the user and the program.<p>--------------<p>Menus of old can be well designed, but they won&#x27;t be consistently designed across all programs.<p>That said, the older menu system of MS Word was well designed. The <i>real</i> issue was that they totally reorganized everything in a feeble attempt to get people to start using the more advanced style options of MS Word.<p>&quot;Properly&quot; using MS Word involves using it more like LaTeX or HTML: you use semantic markup, and then later style your document. (or use a style that is consistent with the rest of your office).<p>But people would rather just hit the bold button or italics button. They don&#x27;t want automatically generated table of contents or figure charts... they want to manually type that stuff in... like a typewritter from the 80s or something.<p>I don&#x27;t know, I can agree that the new Ribbon interface makes it harder to do certain things in Word, but that was unfortunately the purpose. People need to learn the semantic-markup style of Word and start using better methodologies to organize their Word Documents. But no one seems to put in the time or effort to learn how to use the programs they use every day.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve put in the effort to learn the &quot;new way&quot; Microsoft wants you to use MS Word. And I personally agree with Microsoft, documents are much more consistent, and much easier to update styles consistently across the whole document when you focus on styles first and foremost. Hiding the Bold and Italics buttons (and several other popular... but &quot;wrong&quot; features) was a wakeup call indeed.<p>The problem is that most users don&#x27;t like being told that &quot;they&#x27;re using the program wrong&quot;. Part of it is truth (really, the new way is better). Part of it is business based though (Using a document editor as a fancy typewritter means you&#x27;re ignoring a lot of useful features... and are probably better off using the much simpler Google Docs, or OSS like Abiword)",1390450994

Sometimes utterly contradictory (&quot;inflammable&quot;, &quot;citation&quot;, &quot;oversight&quot;, etc.)  It&#x27;s when I find people dismissing common terms or arguing <i>against</i> the dictionary that I rapidly lose interest.  What&#x27;s the context/field for your use of decoupling?<p><i>&quot;Population growth is exponential, but the exponential rate keeps changing&quot;</i><p>Mapping different fits to different portions of a curve is neither unknown nor invalid.  A mathematical model simply describes the behavior of data.  The underlying mechanism isn&#x27;t itself described by the model (which itself is something of an orrery).  Instead, as Murphy notes, population was responding to markedly different circumstances at different points along the line. You&#x27;ve neatly skipped over his explicit recognition of this:  &quot;What accounts for the discontinuity in slope?&quot;, and:<p><i>Plotting global population in the last thousand years (below), we see a few breaks in the slope. For most of this period, we saw a modest 0.12% growth rate, amounting to a 600 year doubling time. Around 1700, the rate stepped up to 0.41%, doubling every 170 years. The next break happens around 1870, jumping to 0.82% and 85 years to double. Then around 1950, we see another factor-of-two rate jump to 1.7%</i><p>What happened at those dates?  1700 marks the nascent beginning of the Industrial Revolution (Newcoman&#x27;s steam engine pumps in coal mines) and more abundant coal.  1870 marks (roughly) electricity and modern sewerage, sanitation, antisceptics, and anesthesia.  1950 marks the beginnings of the Green Revolution as well as the great advance of manufacturing and post-war renaissance around the globe.  The earlier 0.03% growth to ~6000BC marks the period prior to advanced agriculture and urbanization.  Noting where your tidy mathematical model breaks is just as important as seeing where it fits.<p>In the &quot;Economist&quot; dialog, you&#x27;re failing to recognize the point that it&#x27;s the <i>economist</i> who&#x27;s positing eternal growth:<p>Physicist:  &quot;So what’s a typical rate of annual energy growth over the last few centuries?&quot;<p>Economist:  &quot;I would guess a few percent. Less than 5%, but at least 2%, I should think.&quot;<p>The remainder of Murphy&#x27;s analysis is to demonstrate the patent absurdity of this.<p>I&#x27;ve observed that this leads to a number of fairly typical responses from Murphy&#x27;s critics:<p>⚫ He&#x27;s extending a growth trend which has broken down in recent years (your objection).  The point is that the energy growth he demonstrates is tightly coupled (correlated) with economic growth.  And if you want the latter, you&#x27;re going to need the former.<p>⚫ Economic growth has been decoupled from energy growth.  The graphical evidence I&#x27;ve shown suggests otherwise.<p>⚫ Technology will fix everything.  &quot;Growth doesn&#x27;t depend on increasing material consumption at all&quot;.  /u/geezerman at reddit and Tim Worstall at <i>The Telegraph</i> essentially make this argument.<p>⚫ &quot;There is no energy/resource shortage&quot;.  Humans will find and tap endless sources of new energy and raw material ... somehow.<p><i>I don&#x27;t accept the fundamental premise</i><p>So:  what would be a valid basis for a model of future resource availability?  How do you address Hubbert peaking and depletion curves and the accuracy with which they&#x27;ve predicted known peaks in local, national (US and elsewhere), and by appearances, global oil production, as well as other resource peaks?<p>Rubbishing models without presenting a more accurate one yourself (or pointing at one) isn&#x27;t science, it&#x27;s denial.",1390450655

7106966,comment,7105712,7106351,10,0,billyhoffman,,,"People here seem to have a strongly misplaced expectations about what bug bounties pay. Vulnerabilities in web apps/servers tend to be worth less than vulnerabilities in client computers for a few reasons<p>First, web app vulns are usually specific to a single site. (Unless obviously you find an issue in a common underlining framework, say, a session fixation attack in how PHP or ASP.NET handles sessions).<p>Second, and much more importantly, the vast majority of site&#x27;s don&#x27;t have financially actionably information. Unless you handle banking/credit card info, I am limited in what I can do to extract value from the server (compared to a compromised client). There aren&#x27;t that many vectors to extract value.<p>-Dump their list of usernames/passwords? Ok, maybe some of those will also be used on other banking or commerce sites, but I have challenges/risks actually getting money out. And if I want stolen credit card numbers I can just buy them in card forums.<p>-Serve sleazy advertising? Ok, possible, but ad&#x27;s are a crappy business to be in and its definitely a high volume/long time approach (ask how well Huffpo pays its writers). You can try affiliate spamming/stuffing, but again, not huge value. Both ads and affiliate approaches are dependent on how much traffic the server you hacked gets. Low traffic, you make no money. The more traffic, the larger the site, the smarter/better equipped the IT/security team. How long do you really think an Alexa top 10 or top 100 site won&#x27;t notice an IFRAME pointing to .ru or .cn?<p>-Mining cryptocurrency? Not financially viable<p>What usually happens when a server is compromised is that an exploit kit is installed and it&#x27;s used to attack the visitors (specifically exploit a vulnerability in the client). And so we are back to attacking clients to extract value over attacking (most) websites. Why do this? Simple:<p>- There are orders of magnitude more desktops/browsers than web servers.\n- They are running tons of diverse plugins and software so the attack surface is much larger.\n- Most of that software will be out of date and have known vulnerabilities.\n- Very few of these clients are &quot;managed&quot; by a personal IT person like a web server. The user is far less likely to notice anything bad.<p>All of that mean I can reach more targets, compromise a larger number of them, <i>and</i> hold them for longer. Why is this better than pwning a server? Because lots of scenarios to extract value that don&#x27;t work on a handful of web servers <i>do</i> work when I have thousands and thousands of compromised clients:<p>-Show them ads\n-Stuff affiliate links\n-Changing their DNS settings and MitM all their traffic (bank.com? Why that&#x27;s right over here!)\n-Keylog them to actually steal financial data, credits cards, bank logins, etc\n-Use them to send spam\n-Use them as a botnet to DDoS people and get paid protection money\n-Mining? perhaps?<p>To put this in prospective, very smart hackers doing crazy stuff to break out of Chrome&#x27;s sandbox and exploit clients are getting $50-$100k in public contests like Pwn2Own. Getting $35,000 for a RCE is pretty awesome",1390450607

They don&#x27;t have any chance in the case of an embedded script.  Now if we go back to my original concern, it&#x27;s that merchants are being told that they simply need to implement Stripe.js & enable HTTPS.  Modifying that statement to something like this would be far better:<p>&quot;Stripe minimizes the scope of PCI DSS by removing the need to implement and audit security controls surrounding the transmission, processing, and storage of card-holder data.  This does not; however, absolve Merchants from compliance with the PCI DSS & in order to assist with that we offer the following...&quot;",1390450131

The merchant is presenting the form for which the user enters their credit card information from within the context (same origin) of their domain: e.g., <a href=""https://merchant.com/payment.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://merchant.com/payment..</a>.  As a result, under the PCI DSS they are obligated to protect that component of the transaction because if they don&#x27;t a criminal could change it so that the card data doesn&#x27;t POST to Stripe.com but instead goes to the criminal.  Implementing a bit of Javascript and enabling SSL/TLS is far from all that is needed to be PCI compliant as a merchant so long as the payment form itself, whether delivered via an iFrame or a bit of Javascript is hosted within the merchant domain.",1390449859

I used it a few times to get cheaper tickets:<p>when you are buying long distance flight tickets, pick a city close to where you will depart (this will add an additional flight transferring from your departure city). When you get multiple transfers there is a possibility that the offered price will be cheaper (I confirmed this with an agency when I initially  figured this out). If you get a cheaper price buy it and call the airlines to tell them you will miss the first flight, and have them correct the check in location to your departure city.

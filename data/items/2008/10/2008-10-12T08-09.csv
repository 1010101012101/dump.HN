Members can opt-in to view one another's positions before doing business: like befriending someone on Facebook or Friendfeed.<p>Also, perhaps from this pillar of transparency, it may be possible to cancel net debt positions computationally rather than let markets gradually build again. Many people may lose out, but others should be held accountable and people can move on.",1223801849

330206,comment,330104,330205,0,0,froo,,,"yes, I know... and on reddit (which is where I picked up on it) and it originated on the UG forums, this wasn't a question on the origins of the nomination idea, it was on how to deal with the media attention as a result of spearheading the voting effort.<p>I'm not saying, nor have I ever said it was my idea, I've just helped focus the chaos.<p>By the way, I actually know the vote totals so far (from someone at MTV who reached out to me) and can quite comfortably say that the tool on our site has contributed to a significant amount to that number (which I can't disclose), given I know how many we've also done.",1223801551

330202,comment,330046,330134,0,0,fallentimes,,,"1. World wide? What source are you referencing? The States sure, but I have no idea about the rest of the world and have never read anything talking about world wide debt rates.<p>2. See number 1.<p>3. The saving rate statistics are misleading because they don't include 401k and IRAs, which were not nearly as popular 10-20 years ago as they are today.",1223800699

330200,comment,329993,329993,0,0,symptic,,,"My partner and I were discussing this exact thing earlier, albeit in more harsh terms.<p>Our consensus was that companies need to form around a business model rather than a business model form around a community. Communities suffer form group-think and tons of start ups show this to be true. This isn't how we should be doing business. Keyword there: Business. Not ""projects"" or ""apps"" or ""widgets"".",1223800140
330197,comment,329763,329763,0,0,fallentimes,,,"Buying albums doesn't support the talent - it supports the suits. Margin wise, artists make jack shit from albums. They make significantly higher cuts from touring, but even that isn't enough.<p>I wish there was an easy way to donate to the bands directly. No TPS and no big labels taking 90%. Clean, easy, and direct. Tipjoy are you listening? :)",1223799696

330194,comment,330104,330190,0,0,froo,,,"When did I say I took credit for the rickroll?<p>The story is more like how I helped co-ordinate a large group of people (it will be several hundred thousand people by the time this is done given we're now at 150k) getting an 80's pop star the best act ever award (an award I might add that they probably weren't going to nominate him for given they announced it days before without his name), completely frustrating a major media organisation by getting Astley the vast majority of the votes in the process.... in my spare time.<p>That's a pretty cool story IMO.",1223799084
330193,comment,330139,330139,0,0,natrius,,,"If you're correct that a social aversion to debt will develop, then debt will become cheaper as demand decreases, at least after banks have money to lend again. In that case, it seems like swearing off debt as you suggest would be passing up a bargain.<p>Debt often makes sense.",1223798933

330191,comment,330139,330139,0,0,ahold,,,"""Most prestigious nation on earth""? Update: (I had to puke.) You are just 'known'. Known as most militant and most dangerous. You are directly or indirectly responsible for every war in the last 60 years. If you sniff oil, or other form of money, you are ready to kill even civilians or children. You are also ready to send your sons to die for smell of money. You have biggest number of homeless in the world, even children and so we can continue whole day... but I still hope there are some people there who understand this and can do something with that. This is how we perceive you here in Europe, my fellow ""Americans"". :) or :(",1223798603

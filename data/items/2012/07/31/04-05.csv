This type of communication would be undetectable by the questioner (the verifier) and thus allow a group of attackers to ""cheat"" various cryptographic protocols. However, it is found that MIP* contains MIP. Therefore, there are proof systems (and thus protocols) resistant to quantum communication of the provers.<p>Thus, zero-knowledge proofs and the like still work in with quantum entanglement powered assailants.",1343710764

Just have to laugh and move on.<p>I was once at a interview were the HR people were assholes like that though the IT manager in a seprate interview was blown away with my skill's and demostrated abilities and offered me more than what I was asking for,  I turned them down due to the experience I had in the HR interview prior to the technical interview and told them why as well.  Took a lesser paid job at a company called RAND who I had also interviewed with that same day.  Had HR not been so rude and downright insulting due to my age etc, then I would of taken there job offer.

We have in the neighborhood of 5 million lines of (mostly C++) video game middleware that my department works on, all of which must be backwards compatible, all of which can't be significantly overhauled easily. It also builds on 15 different target platforms with 2-5 configuration variations per platform.<p>Similarly, we use Perforce. Similarly we have a CI system that builds our code on a farm of VMs, though ours does fairly extensive unit testing on every build. We also have a significant number of version permutations we test on a fairly regular basis as well.<p>We regularly, automatically, run Valgrind and it's on my to-do list to hook up the Microsoft static analyzer and investigate code coverage tools.<p>One saving grace is that the code base is very modular and has decently quick iteration times in general.

Our main result is the first nontrivial lower bound on the class MIP* of languages having multi-prover interactive proofs with entangled provers; namely MIP* contains NEXP, the class of languages decidable in non-deterministic exponential time. While Babai, Fortnow, and Lund (Computational Complexity 1991) proved the celebrated equality MIP = NEXP in the absence of entanglement, ever since the introduction of the class MIP* it was open whether shared entanglement between the provers could weaken or strengthen the computational power of multi-prover interactive proofs. Our result shows that it does not weaken their computational power: MIP* contains MIP. \nAt the heart of our result is a proof that Babai, Fortnow, and Lund's multilinearity test is sound even in the presence of entanglement between the provers, and our analysis of this test could be of independent interest. As a byproduct we show that the correlations produced by any entangled strategy which succeeds in the multilinearity test with high probability can always be closely approximated using shared randomness alone, and are thus restricted to being quasi-classical.\n""""""<p>(I have no idea what that means.)",1343709683

Is anyone who says something that aligns with a corporate interest plus takes a million dollars from said interest a ""shill""?<p>I like a good muckraking as much as the next guy but in the end, judging individual actors as ""shills"" or whatever obscures the important issues, which are systemic. It may even be that tarring a few people as shills and frauds is a big mistake insofar as the rest of us then take that as a license to let ourselves off the hook.<p>In my opinion academia, medicine, and journalism (to pick three pretty important institutions) are all corrupt in this systemic way, a way that has little to do with individual choice (apart from a few ethically gifted souls whom we can all admire but mostly won't imitate) and much to do with human nature. And this is a big, big deal because it deeply affects what those institutions are producing. Think of all the work done on how big pharma gets doctors to push their product into people who don't need it, or about how journalists are mollified by ""access"" (friendly personal contact) with powerful people they're covering.<p>The really great thing about what researchers like Ariely are doing is that it could lead to an objective basis for preventing the conditions for corruption from arising in the first place.

The truth is that there are simply techniques that have been finely crafted over decades that you are simply unlikely to discover from your own hacking.  There are algorithms that are subtle and the product of pure academic research.  For example, a self-taught hacker probably wouldn't even know that there are methods to build a self-balancing binary tree.  This is because, in the course of your own hacking projects, you may never encounter datasets that are large enough and ill-conditioned enough for it to matter whether you used a self-balancing node insert algorithm or the standard algorithm that any clever highschool student could roll up.  How many self-taught guys can code quickly and even bug-free, yet don't know that there are better algorithms for sorting than bubble-sort?  These are the type of things that someone with a formal education would be aware of, even if they couldn't code the algorithms themselves or very well.<p>I used to think that just being a good hacker was all it took to be a good developer but the fact is that you don't know what you don't know.

They're used by the Twitter follower selling companies and there's an absolute metric fucktonne of these accounts, some examples of such accounts:<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/Yahairayqlcd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/Yahairayqlcd</a>  \n<a href=""http://twitter.com/Kenyetta992"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/Kenyetta992</a>  \n<a href=""http://twitter.com/Jade_482"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/Jade_482</a>  \n<a href=""http://twitter.com/Mozella_nxi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/Mozella_nxi</a>   \n<a href=""http://twitter.com/Alane508"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/Alane508</a><p>It's becoming a really big problem, every day I come across accounts that have bought followers\* (a few belonging to HN users) and it's... disappointing. Inevitable, but disappointing. I started putting together a website for checking if someone had bought their followers but haven't found the desire to finish it yet, but there are so many that do it, anywhere from purchasing 4,000 to 80,000 followers which can be done for ~$300.<p>I've been reporting the people doing this to Twitter but nothing has been done about it, ultimately it looks good for Twitter metrics so I doubt they care that there are people with 80k fake followers, that's an extra 80k users for their investors to salivate over.<p>As a side note, it's fun to pick out a random account (like those listed above) and see who they're following, there are some people you'd not expect to be purchasing followers that are. An alternate theory is that Twitter is responsible (after all, how can they not detect these obvious bots?) but I can't see why... well I can, but I don't think they would.<p>*I'm probably alone in this but people that buy followers really irk me because I like numbers to be accurate. The site I started making had a directory of people that bought followers, I'm wondering if I should finish it up, I figure it would be interesting for people to see that a large number of ""media personalities"" are just buying up their followers.",1343708058

4315659,comment,4311287,4313792,1,0,blair_strang,,,"Re: images over HTTPS; most of the attacks involve an active MITM, so it's a question of how seriously you take that threat. Usually, most people ignore this scenario until it gets automated via ""coffee shop network attack tools"" like firesheep or sslstrip.<p>As a practical matter, if you embed http images in your HTTPs page I believe you will get mixed content warnings in some browsers. See e.g: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3278341/help-with-ssl-vulnerability-mixed-content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3278341/help-with-ssl-vul...</a><p>Another strike against non HTTPs images is that if you don't have the 'secure' flag set on your cookies, these may get sent with requests, compromising your users' sessions. I guess you could consider not setting this cookie flag as a separate issue. Note that this is a passive threat, exploitable via sniffing.<p>Thirdly, an active MITM can return any MIME type in response to your <img src> link; you now have to be 100% sure that no browsers will try to process a malicious response of any type when it gets one instead of an image. Probably OK, but are you absolutely 100% sure? What about indefinitely, as browsers implement new features?<p>Fourthly, think about all the creative ways a malicious user could embed instructions or change the appearance of your site by substituting arbitrary image content. Also note that SVGs can run javascript. One could change an image to be an ad or promotion, for example, to convince the user to carry out an action.<p>I wouldn't neccesarily follow facebook's lead on security practices.<p>Modern thinking is that if you care about SSL at all, you should force SSL for everything. For example if your ""secure banking site"" has an HTTP landing page, an active MITM will just sslstrip the customers and get them to enter their password in the wrong box.<p>This is why we have HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) header, and why sites that care deeply about security (gmail, paypal, lastpass, etc) use it.

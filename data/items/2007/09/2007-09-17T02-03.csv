If there's a cautionary tale here, it is that you can't take a dying project, sprinkle it with the magic pixie dust of ``open source,'' and have everything magically work out. Software is hard.

You built up credit by watching ads, and you couldn't do certain things online when your ad credit was too low. So you could have a screen with lots of ads open in your loungeroom for an evening and top it up. ",1189997090

55492,comment,55381,55381,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Xen is great for many things, especially for performance. With help from newer processors it can essentially run a virtualized OS at close to native speeds. You could do the same with commercial offerings from VMWare but as far as free solutions go it doesn't get much better than this. Having separate VMs for each service does indeed make it easy to scale but you don't need to go through this overhead from the start. Instead try to focus on building share nothing architectures that can scale horizontally and then you can worry about VMs at a later point.",1189996846

55487,comment,54965,54965,0,0,arvid,,,"As a former mathematician, I can understand what he writes. Mathematically, it is basically  a lot of ranting and raving over nothing. Set theory provides a foundation for mathematics.  It is not the only foundation.  Category theory is another.   Pedagogically, his argument makes more sense. I think he is mostly arguing against using set theory in the teaching of math.  True most mathematicians do not use set theory and mathematicians studied math for years without the concept of a set. Set theory is more used as a language and for that reason it is taught. In this sense, set theory is like turing machines and turing equivalence. Important concept, yes. Good to know, yes. Used by most in comp sci, no.  Necessary, no.",1189995977
55486,comment,54977,55229,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Yes. One of the nice things about a smart hosted gmail system is that when spam happens, they will see a corresponding flood of spam reports coming in over a certain amount of time, so that would make it much easier to stem the flood of spam. I am sure there is quite a lot to it which we will never know, but it does seem to be the best out there.",1189995971

Especially CLRS.<p>If you don't know much about algorithms right now, then you'll find Cormen et al. very challenging to start with.<p>If you're like me, you want to be able to use algorithms as a tool to solve real problems. <p>To practice that, I have a few suggestions, if I may be so bold. <p>Pick up a copy of the Algorithm Design Manual and Programming Challenges, by Steven Skiena. Programming Challenges will introduce you to the ACM-ICPC repository of programming problems, which is a great low-pressure area to build some top-notch skill in algorithms. You'll want to get into TopCoder as well. <p>For a slightly different taste, pick up Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, also known as AIMA or the Green Book. Its discussion of search algorithms is unrivaled.<p>Good luck!",1189995957
55484,comment,54977,55178,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I always wonder about google and that - gmail was (and still is I think) spread by sending invites. So there is the FOAF angle there as well - and the same accounts are used in all their apps not just email. Mix in search history (if you use it - which I don't) and that is just frightening.",1189995764

55478,comment,55381,55381,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"What you build should be scalable, whether you are on one server or a thousand. I'm a huge VM fan, mainly because of the complexity of some systems we use. If you solve your app for a few VMs somewhere, it becomes trivial (mostly) to scale. Then you can do backups easily, share snapshots of complex systems, allocate hardware resources virtually, etc.<p>Not sure about Xen, though. I've been using VMWare for a bit and I'm a happy customer.I would be interested in hearing how the various VM tools compare.",1189994631

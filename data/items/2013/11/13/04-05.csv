6723417,comment,6722693,6723118,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"Fascinating stuff, and a great comment overall.<p>But one thing needs to be clarified here: the fear over &quot;killer robots&quot; is that the capacity to make war could be placed largely on autopilot. The danger isn&#x27;t so much a Terminator-style robotic uprising, which is so farfetched in today&#x27;s world as to be sensationalistic (if not laughable). Rather, the danger -- a very real one, at that -- lies in an accidental war as the result of malfunctions or data-interpretation errors.<p>We have more to fear from dumb AI than from smart AI.<p>As it turns out, the US and the Soviet Union came perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions over the result of computer errors. (For an interesting look into the subject, I recommend Eric Schlosser&#x27;s &quot;Command and Control,&quot; a recently released history of nuclear weapons policy over the last 50 years).<p>Banning autonomous or semi-autonomous tactical systems (&quot;Terminators&quot;) seems misguided and impractical. These things will get built, and some of them are being built already. The jury is still out on the ethics of building them (Do they save lives by taking humans off the front lines? Or do they take lives by turning war into a sort of game?). But they&#x27;re being built, and that genie&#x27;s not going back in the bottle.<p>But banning fully autonomous <i>strategic</i> systems (&quot;Skynet&quot;) seems more fruitful and worthwhile. Again, this is not because we expect &quot;Skynet&quot; to become self-aware and intentionally initiate a nuclear holocaust. It&#x27;s because &quot;Skynet&quot; might misinterpret something and accidentally initiate a nuclear holocaust.<p>(I don&#x27;t mean to dismiss the very real role of human error in this same domain. But fail-safes, in the form of humans having the final decisionmaking authority over warfare at a strategic level, make a lot of sense.)<p>I&#x27;m a layman here, and I&#x27;m way out of my depth in discussing the intricacies of war making AI. But the way I see it, we need to avoid a sort of dangerous middle ground here. Either we keep AI dumb and intentionally non-autonomous, or we make AI a heck of a lot <i>smarter</i> (therefore reducing the risk of fatal errors).<p>In a weird way, building Skynet might be less risky than getting halfway to Skynet. A relatively dumb AI with full autonomy is a frightening thing. An extremely smart AI with the same degree of autonomy is a little unnerving, perhaps, but it&#x27;s significantly less dangerous in practical terms.",1384318409

It tells you absolutely nothing about, <i>if</i> you observe such-and-such data, <i>then</i> how strongly should we believe the hypothesis.<p>For example, you could have an extremely unlikely hypothesis (eg. &quot;dice are controlled by alien telepathy&quot;), test it, and still come out with p < 0.05 because of something much more plausible (&quot;the dice were badly made and are biased&quot;). This is known as the base rate fallacy; an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof. Moreover, to prove an extraordinary claim, you must show it is more likely <i>not</i> just compared to chance, but compared to every less extraordinary alternative, including &quot;the experimenters are faking the data&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also entirely possible to get a result at p < 0.05 that makes the hypothesis you&#x27;re testing <i>less</i> likely.

You take some measurements, and get values of 19.6, 17.4, 20.1, 20.4 and 18.5.<p>Now, this is a significant result at p < 0.05 - <i>if</i> the star is 13.4 light-years away, <i>then</i> getting these numbers has a probability of less than 5%. However, these results completely <i>rule out</i> the hypothesis you&#x27;re testing. The numbers you get are pretty unlikely if the real number is 13.4, but <i>extraordinarily</i> unlikely if the real number is 12,000, so this experiment makes the 13.4 number <i>more</i> credible. This kind of thing is why lots of researchers still believe in psychic powers - they keep testing for psychic powers, and keep getting results at p < 0.05, but don&#x27;t notice their results make psychic powers <i>less</i> plausible.

I vaguely remember that weird difference being part of the way Hallmark has managed to hold the copyright to Happy Birthday. If I remember correctly, the lyrics were way out of copyright, but the piano arrangement that was written in the 30s or 40s and is now in common use now was copyrightable. Bleh.",1384315208

964941,comment,964613,964754,0,0,tungstenfurnace,,,"Thanks for the criticism! I take your point about fructose and appetite.<p>My reason for believing that carbs stimulate the sympathetic nervous system is that I think that, paradoxically, excitement and stress are essentially the same thing. (Excitement initially <i>feels</i> better because thoughts are stimulated and negative emotions are numbed, along with the rest of the body.) Whatever, when it comes to blood sugar, hyper is followed by hypo, so you can get cortisol that way.<p>I doubt that looking at neurotransmitters is the right way to think about addiction. It is a mental phenomenon which operates on a different level of abstraction. To use an analogy from computing, explaining a software bug does not in general require looking at hardware.<p>Until we have good explanation of addiction, we can't meaningfully test related theories. So it's hard to take seriously what medical science currently regards as evidence in this matter. However, the fact that AA uses a 'spiritual' programme to break addiction, and that some addicts claim to have been helped by mystical experiences brought on by hallucinogens -- these do seem like significant pointers.<p>More basically, people commonly report being in two minds about food, which is the hallmark of addiction.",1259395148

964928,comment,964519,964883,0,0,camccann,,,"<i>To turn matter into biochar requires heat input - so generally this means burning some sort of fuel - which releases CO2. Leaving the matter as it is, or burying it does not require this fuel, hence the CO2 ""savings"" are even greater. To do all this to sequester carbon seems to be missing the point, and we'd all be better off by not burning anything in the first place.</i><p>Well, organic matter normally releases carbon when it decays, so just leaving it as-is would be carbon neutral, liberating the carbon the plant originally drew from the air to grow.<p>On the other hand, the pyrolysis process requires energy, yes, but releases very little carbon from the material being processed. The resulting carbon-rich biochar doesn't rot, so the carbon isn't released back into the atmosphere but remains in the soil, while new plants grow in place of the old ones, pulling more carbon from the air.<p>The claim in the article, presumably, is that the carbon output associated with the energy to heat the biomass is less than the amount of inert carbon added to the soil, making the entire process effectively remove carbon from the atmosphere.<p>Highly doubtful that the amount of carbon thus extracted would be significant, though. The soil improvement aspect is far more interesting to my mind, the carbon stuff is probably just a way to get more attention.",1259394338

964920,comment,964518,964827,0,0,rjurney,,,"I needed to do pattern matching to pull data out of many different formats, then clean the data before processing it.  We were parsing radio station song feeds, and the data is varied, chaotic and often unavailable.  This was also a port of a perl POE app, and so it was regex intensive in its original implementation and I don't see how you could effectively deal with such noisy text without regexes.<p>As to snark - his reply was snark, I just replied in kind.  Regexes are incredibly useful for all kinds of things, most especially in parsing data from web services.  The fact that he didn't need them isn't 'funny,' it means we were doing different things.<p>In any case - using Erlang for something like this is so much win.  The POE, and threaded implementations got real ugly real fast as we scaled it up.  I knew Erlang could do it - across boxen, without a problem.  It sounds like the regex libs have improved, and I look forward to using Erlang again in the future.<p>Happy? :D",1259393705

Using &quot;const&quot; doesn&#x27;t really make a difference, it&#x27;s more of a hint for the compiler.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t make any difference in this case.",1428145074

Using a CM I&#x27;d have to:<p><pre><code>  * install ruby and various ruby lib pkgs\n  * install chef or puppet, and a multitude of rubygems \n  * add recipes/manifests\n</code></pre>\nMy image is now several times bigger than it need be, and the configuration is now more opaque, in several files. It&#x27;s a pain to debug and troubleshoot when something deep inside the recesses of chef-solo fails. And why would I?<p>I&#x27;d rather have a dockerfile with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y redis-server` and perhaps a line adding a custom config file. Very readable.",1428144157

Most CAD software now allows some paremeters, like certain lengths or radius can be changed. But if changing the value of such a parameter needs significant changes to something else, the end result is not very good. And trying to generate the model programmatically and read the results of the simulation from an outside program is often harder than it should have to be.<p>--<p>I&#x27;ve seen these designs many times, cool to read more about them.

I won't check Facebook or Twitter or MySpace for the same reason I refuse to check my voice mail at work -- checking too many things and having too many accounts is a waste of time.<p>Send me an email, or I won't respond.

61377,comment,58025,58870,0,0,rabagley,,,"Evolution is an observed fact and even religious leaders 150 years ago did not argue this.  Natural Selection is a theory which explains, without reference to any supernatural agent, how evolution might have happened.  Darwin didn't posit evolution as it wasn't a subject that was very exciting.  It happened, everyone agrees.<p>Natural Selection, on the other hand, is more than just a hypothesis (you're using the word ""theory"" incorrectly).  It (with refinements) is one of the most widely established explanations for all of the observed phenomena of lineages, species differences.  It also made a number of testable predictions that have since been borne out (it predicted DNA, among other things).  More recently, natural selection has led to the development of new sciences, like evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary linguistics, etc. which are taking our understanding of biology and behavior further than ever.<p>Evolution is a fact.  Natural Selection is a theory (and not a hypothesis).  No scientists are ""moving away"" from natural selection.  Anyone who told you that is uninformed or lying.",1191186010

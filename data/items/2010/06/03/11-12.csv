Hiring and firing new doctors, and trying to navigate ""what should I investigate next?"" on my own.  To be fair, there were several doctors who were willing to try (just about) anything I brought to the table, and when they were all out of ideas, they admitted as much.  Unfortunately this type of doctor is rare, in my experience.  Which is why I'm asking for help finding a good one in my area (Cleveland).",1275566360

Swearing is a part of honest society (and, luckily, gratuitous swearing is downmodded to oblivion in my experience).<p>Why did pw0ncakes get upvoted. a) because he is probably right but b) mostly because he accurately represents his generations reaction to things like this (and, lets face it, the original post was rather silly/incindary)<p><i>My suggestions (which will not be popular with many of Ycombinator’s hackers but may meet your goal of civility).</i><p>And here's the problem with this entire post; it adopts the same slightly sneering, ""peering down on us"" tone. It's not overtly rude - but no better, really, than ""fucking asshole"" (once you get over the swear word).<p>It's not, actually, a post about improving civility on HN - it's a thinly veiled attack/return shot :)<p>Ok, I'm not going to support calling the guy and asshole (he sounds like a bit of an idjit, I think, reading through the various posts/comments etc. and the original post he made before the updates did sound a bit ""asshole"") and, yes, there is a slightly growing problem of attacks over fair argument here in HN comments. But this is still a stellar community; positive suggestions are good, sneering resentment, probably not :)<p><i>Send me alerts when comments come in on a story I’ve written</i><p>That's silly; just monitor your logs if you want to see when HN comments come up (or set up a google alert etc.).<p>But actually I would prefer <i>not</i> encouraging people to come here to write about their posts unless they are already a member, reasoning:<p>- they are probably not ""up"" on how things work here, and so it risks going downhill<p>- comments here can be acerbic and honest, and people do take offense at that (which seems unfair to the writer)<p>By all means if it benefits the discussion invite him/her in. Otherwise leave it be :)",1275563124

People use real names on Facebook, and i've seen some very nasty stuff there after wandering into the wrong groups by accident.<p>There just needs to be a way, and a culture, of playing the ball and not the man.  Most of use are OK with the substance of our arguments being torn apart, but aren't ok with abuse.  Sadly there are many who can't do the former so always stick the latter, like quarreling bullies in the schoolyard.  Maybe that's where they are from.",1275563014

Yes, the civility on HN is much higher than on many other discussion sites, but it's still a lot lower than you'd find in most real-world situations.<p>I agree that throwaway accounts are useful, and that there are times when anonymity is advantageous, and that the added civility that comes with real names is a bad tradeoff in this case.<p>However: in this case, the second point (downvoting) didn't prevent an uncivil (yet insightful) comment from becoming the highest ranked comment in the thread.<p>I'm not saying Suster's suggested fixes are good ones-- but I don't think we should dismiss the problematic out of hand.<p>Unchecked nastiness and incivility are the broken windows of the online community.",1275562985
1400949,comment,1400882,1400882,0,0,looprecur,,,"Job hopping is a touchy subject because young people don't like job hopping, as was discussed in those posts. They do it because, in today's corporate climate, they usually have to do it in order to prevent being pigeonholed, neglected, and otherwise left to stagnate.<p>Most people in most companies are going to find that the people above them don't care about their advancement. Sure, companies have their spiel about personal growth and continuing professional development, but it's often paper-thin. Managers can't look out for the careers and development of 10 or 20 different people, so it's often only one or two who gets ""protege"" status (favoritism in project allocation, mentoring, political look-out).<p>Also, the level of visibility and relevant work that are necessary for career advancement in today's competitive culture simply cannot be available to everyone. Unless you're a startup founder, you <i>have</i> to become the protege of someone important-- which only happens for the lucky few within 12 months at a new job, or you're wasting your time. This means that anyone with half a speck of ambition is going to keep moving around until finding a fit. No one exactly likes doing this; it's better to have this success early on and no longer need to ""job hop"".<p>So job hopping is not really voluntary. It's a natural outgrowth of today's corporate culture, one created by our elders who seem to be unhappy about our rational response to it. They're mad that the people under 35 have actually figured out the unwritten rules.<p>Oh, and I am pw0ncakes. Why did I (have to) change username? Because the incivility on Hacker News exists on both sides of the table. At least uncivil comments can be seen and argued against, whereas the sloppy, poorly-reasoned, invisible and heavy-handed ban policy, on the other hand...",1275562866

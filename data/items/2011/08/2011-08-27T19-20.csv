2932296,comment,2931314,2931314,1,0,planetjoe,,,"I just returned to linux after a ~7 year hiatus and have found it to be a night and day experience.  My xp install had gotten so bad that I was forced to escape and decided to try ubuntu on a whim.  I'm so glad I did because the OS is really snappy and I'm able to do everything I was doing on xp and I'm not subject to random crashes.  The reason I think ubuntu is ready for the masses is because the install process, which is the first obstacle to adoption, is mindblowingly fast and smooth compared to what it was like 7 years ago when I was using debian 2.x.  Two major pain points that are now fixed (at least for me):<p>-The wubi installer lets you effortlessly install a dual boot win xp / ubuntu machine in about 45 minutes.  Previously I would have to use QParted or Acronis to carve a new partition and then run a linux installer, which for me wasn't that bad, but would be unseemly for a newbie.  With wubi, you set everything up inside of winxp and it reboots your computer, installs the distro, and you instantly have linux on a dual boot.  Anyone, no matter how little computer knowledge, can give ubuntu a try because of this.<p>- Driver support is much better than it was.  It used to be a major pain to get important hardware such as wireless and video adapters working.  When I installed this time, everything worked out of the box.  This is huge for newbs.<p>After my latest ubuntu install, I'm going to try to fully transition my personal computer to linux.  I'm also comfortable recommending it to those less computer savvy than me.",1314474938

2932266,comment,2931940,2932135,9,0,hxa7241,,,"You are not thinking of the harmful effects of copyright. The mechanism of copyright, by definition, is to restrict the flow of information. This is exactly what you do <i>not</i> want in an information economy.<p>First, because the cost of that restriction is effectively magnified. When information was in paper books, it was difficult to copy. Copyright restricted copies, but since people could not make copies it did not make much difference. But now information is digital the cost of copying is practically zero. That means the restrictions of copyright stops people realising a large benefit that would otherwise be available.<p>Second, the most vital ingredient in production of new information seems most likely not extra monetary incentive, but <i>other</i> information. And the fact that information is infinitely copyable amplifies its value. A single amount of money can pay for only one piece of information production. But a single amount of information can contribute, through copies, to an unlimited number of pieces of information production.<p>This is the funny thing. Copyright really only works with products that are substantially <i>non</i>-abstract, <i>non</i>-informational. When you have an economy that really <i>is</i> all informational, copyright does not actually make sense: its intrinsic contradiction just becomes too self-destructive.",1314474194

It runs the apps I need: perl, sh, apache, php, vim, and stuff from the various software repositories.<p>When I need to interact with data from coworkers at my non-techie organization, I use Windows.  Why?  Because the people there barely know how to use MS Office, much less something more complex.  We use Linux on servers, but not desktops.  Not yet at least.<p>When we need to deal with video, we send it out.  We can do some in-house, but it's time consuming and kind of expensive.  We use Sony Vegas on Windows (which is fine), but the real pros use Macs.  So we have some Mac drives around.<p>The same goes for printing jobs.  We do most of the in-house stuff in Office, and I've been pushing Publisher (which is a POS, but is available).  For dealing with the outside world, though, I need to use Adobe Illustrator, because that's the standard.  (At home I use Inkscape.)  At the printers, they use Macs and PCs, but do most of the real work on Macs.  The UI is just better.<p>The next platform is going to be the iPad.  It's kind of a POS for non-managerial work, but some people just use email and don't really do computer-based work.  They're already using phones, or just don't do the computer thing too much.<p>The Linux desktop is not going to displace Windows.  Windows' edge is not the OS but the ISV (independent software vendor) environment.  It's the most mature low-end ISV market.  The Mac's was decimated with the demise of the old OS, and they're trying to rebuild it, but it's not doing well.  The iTunes app store is potentially a challenger.  The Android market is not a challenger.  Linux's exists only for upper-end enterprise software.<p>Linux could displace Windows is by having a single dominant platform, and having an app store for it that is successful enough to fund a software ecosystem and pay the programmers.  Then, people would choose Linux based on the apps.<p>At least that's the business model that worked for the Apple II / Visicalc, the IBM PC / Lotus 123 / dBaseII, the Mac / Aldus Pagemaker, Sun / SunOS and later Java, and Linux as a datacenter node.",1314474118

It's most likely that that the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi temporarily broke the spell of apathetic stupor.  (or perhaps this only applies to South India, in which case that would be sad yet telling, since South India is the home to most of India's IT sector.)<p>India's high population and smaller landmass (--> higher pop dens) requires innovative, planned, coordinated strategies to conserve resources.  To say that India is a democracy does not mean that it is a meritocracy.  It still seems to be more like a feudal-like hierarchy inherited from the British, which itself was usurped and adapted from the feudal monarchies before.  Most post-colonial states wrestle with issues of being too top-down, despotic, nepotistic.<p>Laws are only really worth anything if they can be adjudicated and enforced.

In a place like Singapore an entrepreneur need to take around 7 permission to start construction, in India you need to take 30+. Is the way to reduce corruption is to bring a new inspector who will looks after all those 30+ permission processes or to reduce these permission to 5 ?<p>Indian government employes 3 million employees out of which 1.4 million are employed purely by railways. Does it make sense for the Ombudman to appoint 7000 inspectors to look after Indian Railways corruption or Should the railways try to thin its staff by outsourcing most of it's processes?<p>Does it make sense to waster tax-payer's money on an ombudsman inspector to look after corruption in a loss making government factory that manufactures soap ? (Yes, in India government runs soap companies). Or should it get rid of that factory itself ?<p>If you want to start a hotel you need to take around 300 permissions our of which most needs to be renewed yearly. One permission for example is from the 'weights and measurements' department which certifies that all the weighing scales in your hotel are up-to the standards. No one bothers to get their scales checked they just send a packet of money to 'weights and measures' department and get permissions.<p>The root cause of corruption in India is not in lack of some laws but the policies which government has put in deliberately to ensure that politicians are in position to control every aspect of it's people's life.<p>In software terms I would say Indian government is a case of bad architectural layout. You have a zillion components tightly coupled with another zillion components which are affecting performance of the system. If someone wants to be efficient he has to hack the system.

People keep saying stuff like ""get better Steve"", which is a nice sentiment but at some point it's not appropriate anymore to talk about a terminally ill person that way.<p>This guy has already survived a very long time with an illness that kills most people within months. He has now chosen to take a bow and exit the stage gracefully, a decision that I'm sure was made as late as possible. I'm certain that resignation letter has been sitting in a drawer at his lawyer's office for quite some time. The truth is this man will be dead within the next few weeks, let's give him the privacy to go out with decency. Paparazzi shots and discussions about how ""not good"" he looks are completely unnecessary.<p>As far as this thread's topic is concerned, the question boils down to the point of whether Apple can thrive on execution alone. We'll see. Ideally, Ive will reconsider scaling back his role as a creative lead. I think together with Schiller's enthusiasm and Cook's organizational talent, there is no reason why Apple shouldn't continue to put out great innovation. But even if they <i>do</i> enter a creative slump, they have a lot of momentum and cash to carry them over any dry spell that might happen.",1314472059

This is a general analysis and not a position on the Lokpal bill itself.<p>Corruption at the lower level of bureaucracy:<p>Corruption/graft is faced by people every day in common functions of their life. The market incentives are there to support graft (low salaries, a huge imbalance in supply and demand - contributed in part due to a very large Indian population, wide disparity in income distributions).<p>But consider that there are limited or no checks <i>against</i> corrupt officers. We got the Right to Information Act (RTI) recently due to civil activism. RTI enables you to get data from public offices. A lot of times this data is enough to point out instances of corruption.
So you can point out corruption, but when you want somebody to act on it, its so far neigh impossible to see action. Police won't register your case easily, so a common man is left with very little avenue to pursue this further.
RTI activists and whistleblowers experience a lot of hostility. 10 were murdered in 2010 alone for bringing to light scams and corruption cases.<p>There is a strong erosion of trust from Government and Public offices. The word correctly describing the situation is <i>malaise</i>. Folks are sick and tired of experiencing day to day exploitation. As with any typical malaise, it crept up, slowly and steadily, steeped into our systems.<p>The bill is seen as hope by a large section of the public as a first step towards fighting corruption. Hence the hundreds of thousands of people out on the street protesting. Peacefully. Not rioting.<p><opinion>
I too have concerns with regards to the policing of the Lokpal body. Or who will guard the guards. 
But strong public opinion and action on corruption is needed.

2932163,comment,2931317,2931317,6,0,mkramlich,,,"I also like to inject into any discusion of home buying the point that nobody truly buys a home, it's just a different variant on renting and serfdom to the state. When I own a ball, it's mine, and absent me using it to hurt someone with it, it will not and cannot legally be taken away from me. Additionally, since I own the ball, and am not merely renting the ball, I do not have to make any monthly or yearly payments to any other party in order to keep ownership and possession of the ball. Where when you ""buy"" and ""own"" a home (assuming current US, etc), you are required in 99.99% of typical situations to pay taxes at periodic intervals. If you do not, eventually men with guns will come use violence if necessary to force you out of that home and take ""ownership"" away from you. If you squint your eyes a bit that should look like renting. Rather, the government entities which claim dominance over the area containing your home have a set of rules which allows you to acquire the illusion of ownership over a home in exchange for paying rent/tax to that government periodically. Whether you call that money transfer rent or tax does not matter as much as the physical event that occurs and it's net effects and consequences.<p>Now I understand there are some ownership qualities to so-called home ownership, not denying that. There are shades of gray between pure renting and pure owning. But what most people talk about is something clearly in the middle of that spectrum, not on one end. Thus, I think the better description is different variants on renting. Different lease permutations.",1314472030

The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that all processes cause the entropy of a system to increase.  But entropy doesn't naturally increase over time without any processes happening.<p>> And doesn't general relativity state that time is a function of gravity or acceleration or relative mass?<p>The apparent passage of time (""proper time"" in a particular reference frame) is influenced by gravity and acceleration.<p>> So wouldn't increasing gravity/acceleration/mass, i.e. relatively increasing the passage of time, also relatively increase entropy?<p>What actually happens is that gravity and acceleration decrease the passage of time (as compared to a reference frame not influenced by the gravity/acceleration.)<p>So if there are two otherwise identical experiments, the one with more gravity/acceleration will experience less time passage, and accumulate less entropy.  But since increases in entropy aren't a direct result of the passage of time, it doesn't follow that increases in entropy lead to more passage of time, or any effect on gravity.<p>Hopefully that makes sense and is mostly correct, it's been a while since I studied this.",1314471757

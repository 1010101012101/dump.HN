At the same time I don't think that replacing coal with nuclear power is acceptable.<p>However, since this thread is pretty much dead (except for us two!) I'll say this:<p>I'm not as anti-nuclear power as I might appear here. For example, I'll happily say that the panic associated with a nuclear leak is usually unjustified. I'll even go so far as to say that nuclear power might have a place in the future of power generation.<p>What I don't like is the uninformed cheerleading by many technophiles of nuclear power.<p>There <i>are</i> real risks associated with nuclear power, and they <i>are</i>  grossly understated by those in the industry, which then gets parroted mindlessly by many. There are plenty of examples on this thread of blind acceptance of ""facts"" put forward by the nuclear industry (disclaimer - I'm not accusing you of this). A trivial amount of research is enough to raise pretty significant questions on them.<p>The trend towards blind acceptance of those claims, and the whole ""nuclear is cool"" thing is what I try & push back strongly against.",1305698212

2559206,comment,2557461,2558489,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I would think you are confused. :-)<p>For one, I don't mind if you don't use Ruby -- I'm not out to evangelize, I'm just responding to one person's response to a simple question: why don't more startups use .NET? I barely care at all what language <i>I</i> use; I have absolutely no interest in what somebody else uses.<p>But, if I asked you why you don't use Ruby, and you said, ""because I have to use Linux and I have all these issues with it"", <i>and Linux was developed and supported by the same people that developed and supported Ruby</i>, I'd say, ""Fair enough.""<p>I was just pointing out that there's a certain guilt-by-association. I mean, this happens all the time in business. When someone talks about a brand, that brand can bring up certain positive or negative connotations in your mind. If someone were to ask me, ""Why aren't you spending any time looking into buying a new GM car"", I would say, ""Well, for one, because my Honda works just fine, and besides, GM makes crap."" Now, GM probably makes at least one really great car -- it's just that I can't be bothered to spend much effort trying to figure out which car that might be.<p>Branding is really something that all business owners should think about often. When people hear your name or see your brand, what do they associate with it? If you go out of your way to lie, cheat, steal, or screw over your customers now, and you put your brand behind that, what is that going to mean for your business tomorrow? Is anybody going to care if you do an about-face and produce a really great product once they get sick of your brand?<p>I think Microsoft's brand is irreparably tarnished among the exact crowd that's most likely to launch tech startups, and since most of that crowd <i>already</i> has a language and set of tools that they like, there's literally a negative incentive for most of them when it comes to considering building on the Microsoft platform.",1305698070

The idea is that even moderates and other more casual observers of a religion tacitly support that religions fundamentalist core.<p>It's a sound argument but there are two main barriers of acceptance. First the anti-theists do not acknowledge that religious beliefs (and indeed many unfounded beliefs) are rational. Religious people are not crazy or uninformed. This is a separate issue from having an inconsistent and / or scientifically unfounded belief system.<p>Second, the anti-theists do not provide much of an alternative.

That being said, he was in a place that is probably worse than what the average reader is in and is now much happier with his life now that he has 'taken control of his life.'<p>I read his story and liked how he discovered he was being held back by his own pre-conceptions of how he ""should"" be living his life. Now that he's doing something he loves doing he's both happier and more successful than he has ever been. Score one point for doing what you love.<p>The cautionary tale is that his 'recipe' won't work for everyone, and probably not for a lot of someones. Writing, like drawing, or programming, or fine carpentry, or any of a number of things takes dedication to learn to do well and hours and hours of practice. If you don't love to write, trying to re-make your life as a blogger is going to fail and fail big. So exhorting people to ""Do what I did, be a blogger!"" is ultimately bad advice for the verbally challenged.

Once you've done that, you can toss out additional ideas or expand on it, but you have to at least do it once.<p>If the actor simply wants to give the director or other actors general notes that they aren't immediately involved in, the answer is ""no way."" The director was hired to shape the overall vision of the show. However, that's not to say that they are infallible. Good directors will generally ask people they trust to come in and watch the show and give feedback. The Artistic Director (the director's boss) will also usually give feedback.<p>And ultimately, directors get reputations. Actors can choose who they want to work with and theatre communities are small. Just a few months back I watched a director get fired and completely ostracized because she was downright mean when it came to giving feedback. She would use insults and fear to control actors.

Now the thing is i have little to no programming or developing experience but have read enough blogs and posts about how you wont get anywhere without having at least a bit of programming knowledge and at least a skeleton of what you want to build. so, the past month or so ive been trying to learn ruby on rails following a tutorial to built a twitter like site. i have to admit though, programming just confuses the hell out of me and is just one of those things that i can't just get or understand easily. but, im gonna continue to try to learn it (while brushing up on my webdesign skills and learning css and html) and maybe try to learn some python with that one learnpythonthehardway tutorial.\nNOW, in the meantime, i want to try to work on a smaller and much simpler project but i need help doing so. the very basics of the site i would like to achieve would be this: users come to a site where they can login (with twitter/google/facebook/etc) and post ""tips/tricks"" (not gonna say about what atm). then other users can vote up or down. these posts are accompanied by tags. users not logged in can only view these posts and not vote. thats the skeleton of this idea. i want to know if there are sites similar to this. ive seen some code snippet sites but i cant recall their names. even better is if there is a tutorial out there that can help guide me in making something like this, even if it is just the very basics. thanks!",1305695987

2559104,comment,2556550,2556550,13,0,Nycto,,,"In theatre, we have a maxim: ""Take the note.""<p>The rehearsal process is short, maybe a month max for straight plays. Once you get past the grind of blocking and memorization, the director doesn't have much time to shape and mold things to make the show fit their vision. Which means that actors have to swallow their insecurities (of which actors notoriously have many) and incorporate everything they're given. Fast. It's an exercise in feedback loops at break-neck speeds. And believe me, directors don't like giving the same note twice.<p>What I'm getting to here is that feedback has become a social event in theatre. I don't mean that there is pizza and noise makers, just that it's done as a group. Every night after a run through, the entire cast will sit down for however long it takes and go through the director's notes -- of which there will be many pages. Given the timeline, there is no time for debate. If you start a discussion with the director, you are wasting their time, as well as the time of all your cast members (who are on the clock). It doesn't matter if your feelings are hurt, or if you have some lame excuse -- at that moment, you're always wrong and the direct is always right. And the only thing going through everyone else's head is, ""Take the note."" There isn't a single actor in the world who wants to work with someone that can't take criticism.<p>The real rub is that all of these opinions are completely subjective, yet deeply personal. Because that's art. Ultimately, you just have to know your shit and be willing to think on your feet. In you're spare time, study what you're given and think about <i>actual</i> ways you can incorporate it. The big realization is that it's collaborative art. Everyone is working together and NEEDS to be willing to work towards the same goal. If you don't, you're the bad apple. Directors will simply stop casting you.<p>I don't know that any of this can be incorporated into the tech world. Maybe this is how we should do code reviews or design meetings. Or run startups. Heck if I know. But it's not something I've personally encountered in any other social groups so far.",1305694878

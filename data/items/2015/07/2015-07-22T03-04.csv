Addressing risks:<p>Coal mining is a strawman. The comparison you want to be making is to solar, wind, hydro, and biomass.<p>All of which compare well with, if not better than nuclear.

<a href=""http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/</a><p>The problem with nuclear power is that, with little warning, things can go very, very wrong. From good neighbor to continent-contaminating, centuries-long nature-preserve (no humans allowed) creation.  The uncertainty and disputes over nuclear accident consequences (Chernobyl deaths: a few dozen, hundreds, thousands, millions? Over what time? When do you close the books? What happens if containment around the sarcophogus fails some time into the future?).<p>The worst power plant accident of time, not a nuclear power plant failure, but a hydro station in China, Banqiao Dam. It&#x27;s instructive several ways:<p>Any number of fairly simple methods would have hugely alleviated the impact of the disaster.  Much as with major nuclear disasters, it was a cascade of failures, starting with poor management and a dysfunctional culture, amplified through poor design, adverse conditions, poor communications, delayed or absent warnings, and little or no disaster response (many of the deaths were attributed to starvation and disease, not drowning or other physical impacts).<p>A useful thing to keep in mind, though, is that <i>after</i> a dam break is done being a a massive disaster area, which typically resolves in a few hours to a few weeks, the land is no longer a glowing radioactive mess.  It can be re-settled and populated as structures and infrasctructure are rebuilt. Zhumadian City, the region surrounding Banqiao, has a present population of over 7 million.<p>Or look up the story of the Johnstown Flood, worst dam break in US history (by deaths), which saw the emergence of the Red Cross, of national response to disasters, and changes in liability laws.<p>(Excepting Johnstown and Banqiao, dam failure mortality falls off rapidly, with another 8 disasters of 1,000+ lives. Wikipedia gives some 908 notable dams, and 137 hydroelectric facilities of 1GW+ net capcity.)<p>There are other questions, notably whether or not &quot;deaths per GWh generation&quot; is the most appropriate measure of risk. Particularly for a technology whose risk tail spans not years, decades, or even centuries, but millennia. Or longer.<p>Last I checked, there were few human institutions with lifespans of similar scale.

There are over a hundred things you have to do right to prevent this, and if you miss one, you lose.<p>I know that isn&#x27;t the answer you wanted, but it&#x27;s the truth, so: don&#x27;t lose your web server.<p>In certain regulated industries you&#x27;ll be encouraged to do some theatre like separating the database from the server on a different network, putting a firewall between them, yadda yadda.  Which is all great, but the web server has to be able to talk to the database in some fashion, and that&#x27;s game over if the web server can say the right things.  If you assume the ability of the attacker to coerce the web server into saying any of the range of things the web server is authorized to say, that&#x27;s usually &quot;pretty bad news&quot; with regards to what you have in your DB.<p>Concrete example: suppose I have the web server connect to the DB with a relatively limited privileged user, which is one thing you should certainly do.  That user only gets access to the proper database on the DB server (which after all might have many of them), which prevents e.g. someone from hopping from a WordPress compromise directly into the main application database...  <i>sorta</i>.  You&#x27;ll probably also want to limit the actions the webserver can take to avoid e.g. creating users or changing schemas.<p>That still leaves the web server able to do CRUD operations, which is <i>easily enough</i> to do a lot of damage to your business and yourself.  Rails can trivially execute &quot;select * from patients;&quot;  That single line, or one isomorphic to it, is a catastrophe if you&#x27;re in healthcare.<p>(Yeah yeah row-level ACLs, I know, I know.  Aside from &quot;Not widely supported in actual web application stacks&quot; they&#x27;re probably not sufficiently robust in the face of a server compromise because the server should be able to authenticate as every user <i>somehow</i> and at that point you&#x27;re just a for-loop away from total compromise.)",1437535953

The difference is difficult for a member of a dominant group to fully understand, partly because they don&#x27;t have to be aware of their position in a dominant group every single day, whereas members of oppressed groups are constantly reminded of their position.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that men don&#x27;t have their own issues that they need support with -- issues like (I think) higher rates of unemployment, depression, suicide, drug abuse, imprisonment, lower graduation rates, problems with custody and child support payments, etc. Some people do go too far in saying that if you&#x27;re a member of a dominant group then you cannot claim to suffer from discrimination in any way, and that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m trying to say.<p>I totally agree that the long-term goal should be to make e.g. women in CS programs unexceptional -- and to get there we need to recognize the ways that we make it harder for those women who are in CS programs today to stick it out.",1437534852

Several of my relatives own million dollar homes there, and none of them are college educated or had spectacular careers or anything. Their only advantage is they were part of previous generations. Not a single one of them could hope to buy their current homes if they were starting their career from scratch today. Relative to housing costs, they enjoyed incomes that today would be in the range of a $300k+ base salary.<p>We look back on their lives and don&#x27;t see them as particularly posh because we&#x27;re blinded by the astounding pace of technological growth.

That&#x27;s why the paragraph about Ford and Toyota is very relevant here; once that wireless exploit is found (and believe me, it <i>will</i> be found; this is a question of <i>when</i>, not <i>if</i>), drivers of Toyotas and Fords are hosed.  Being anywhere on that list of &quot;hackable&quot; cars [0] should be recognized as a significant problem, but manufacturers are continuing to blow off the core problem and only react to specific breaches.<p>Basically, folks like Chrysler, Ford, and Toyota (and other mentioned manufacturers, too, like Cadillac) are relying on white hats and grey hats to be the ones finding the zero-day exploits in their wireless systems.  And even when those exploits <i>are</i> found, they&#x27;re being &quot;addressed&quot; with half-assed solutions like requiring an upgrade via USB (never mind that if a remote attacker can <i>hijack the brakes and transmission</i>, of all things, an OTA upgrade should at least be possible).<p>In other words, I&#x27;m not ignoring Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;response&quot; at all.

Windows tools tend to be monolithic, which is okay for certain things, but it&#x27;s generally difficult to extend.  As a developer, modularity is important to me.  Even GCC I can&#x27;t use to build any development tools since it&#x27;s monolithic.  LLVM is extremely modular though and even provides an intuitive API to interface with the AST, which makes building any new tools simpler (ycm is based on it).<p>I disagree on the well thought out IDE.  A lot of people I know are more productive with them, but the functionality tends to actually slow me down.  The interfaces are generally point and click oriented, which I prefer to avoid.  Another issue is that non-typical functionality tends to be hidden behind deep, unintuitive menus.  Doing simple things often means digging through documentation, searching the web, or even manually digging through menus which wastes a lot of time for me.  For example, building a static LUT with 255 entries.  With vim (nvim), all I need to do is...<p><i>qqILUT[<c-r>=i<cr>] = y;<cr><esc>:let i+=1<cr>q254@q</i>.<p>I&#x27;d be skeptical there&#x27;s a way to do that in an IDE.<p>I personally haven&#x27;t had any issues using syntax based or explicit code folding in vim (nvim), but it&#x27;s rare that I actually need it.

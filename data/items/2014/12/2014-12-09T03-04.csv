My problem is not with teaching/grading/doing silly RA work [1], but that they expect me to spend my entire Saturday and most of Sunday doing it just because the faculty are flying away early on Monday.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to put it, but it&#x27;s not just a matter of working, it&#x27;s about feeling respected. And I think that component is not there.<p>[1] My last RA work involved going to the website of the top 100 US and international business school, and collecting the number of assistant professors and the details of all the female and African American asst professors. It seems MBA rankings are starting to include that in their rankings so the faculty wants to recruit in those demographics. (And when I reported back that there was not a single African American assistant prof in finance in the top 100, I was told to go back and include the next 50 in the list).",1418097415

I would love others to weigh in, correct me, add but I&#x27;m assuming not your own infrastructure, which is a valid option :<p>for a small webpage/server, perhaps linode or digital ocean.   I find heroku nice for free hosting, but they are a bit pricy for paid services.  I do love how easy it is to push code to heroku (especially with ruby on rails).  if you never used amazon and only want to use it for a year, their micro instance is free for one year.<p>for large scaling systems and a suite of services, I would suggest AWS.  they have so many services it confuses the heck out of me sometimes.  if you want low cost high performance, especially for development digital ocean seems better for this.<p>i never used Azure, cant comment on it.  Also there was a company that basically rented physical servers at a cheap price, from what I remember they had the best performance per cost that I have seen.  Also another obvious consideration is software/applications - some tie in better than others.  for instance, I use ArcGIS Server which is VERY easy to deploy on AWS",1418097404

The cost of goods, while reflecting the value added, also has the cost of externalities extracted.  The cost of the cab ride may include gas and equipment depreciation, but may not include the cost of the driver&#x27;s family not having the opportunity to find a better lot in life.  Maybe it all works out fine; I don&#x27;t know.  But I&#x27;m guessing people with minimum wage jobs are not setting their own price for their work, but rather society is conspiring against them to convince them to work for less than their actual cost.

I consider it a feature rather than a bug.<p>For example, if you have the parameters at 33% and 100%, you converge on a racist/segregated state. However, at 33% and 95%, people keep moving around. You see the large contiguous regions that would otherwise be suburban enclaves hollow out. But you never get to a stable state, which is kinda like real life so it works.<p><i>Small individual bias → Large collective bias.</i><p>This is so incredibly true. I wrote about this.

Let&#x27;s also assume that beauty is uncorrelated to kitty-race and that there are only two colors: white (80%) and orange (20%). You&#x27;d expect that 7 contestants would be orange: a proportionate share from the non-racist states and none from the racist states. But you&#x27;ll actually get very few, because the non-racist states still want their cats to win, so they&#x27;ll be <i>de facto</i> racist for strategic reasons except for an occasional &quot;weird&quot; state (say, Minnesota) that nominates an orange cat and Fox News doesn&#x27;t shut up about it being &quot;political&quot; in its &quot;making a statement&quot; (even if the orange cat from Minnesota <i>was</i> the most beautiful). Thus, when you look at the contestants and see 49-50 white cats, it creates a horrible and completely false perception that white is the standard of cat beauty and that no one finds orange cats beautiful.<p>In other words, small differences in preference, once they gain a certain social currency and acceptability, snowball into something a lot more horrible. This is also why it&#x27;s so important to keep racism socially unacceptable, and why Stetson Kennedy&#x27;s infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan (he exposed it as childish and ludicrous) was so powerful.",1418097004

8720891,comment,8719593,8720761,0,0,mikeash,,,"Those first two suggestions are good. The last one, not so good.<p>First, it&#x27;s not very random. As you point out, it will often just be zero. If zero is acceptable to you, then just initialize it to zero. If you need something reliably different then you can&#x27;t count on uninitialized memory to deliver it.<p>Second, it will trip diagnostics in tools like Valgrind, which you&#x27;ll have to either silence or ignore.<p>Third, and this is a real fun one, any C program which reads from uninitialized memory is non-conforming, which means that the compiler is allowed to assume that it never happens. For an example, let&#x27;s say you wrote some code to flip a coin &quot;randomly&quot;:<p><pre><code>    int uninitialized;
    if((uninitialized % 2) == 0) printf(&quot;heads&quot;);
    else printf(&quot;tails&quot;);

Perhaps. But it&#x27;s also possible that the professor did something egregious, and it may not be helpful to air that out (especially if it means reproducing offensive photos that were allegedly sent).<p>So when is conduct benign enough that the University could just publish, and when is it not?

Or for instance, it is possible to appropriate the rhetoric of &quot;social justice&quot; and construct a troll that is indistinguishable from a legitimate statement, the only difference is the context, e.g. used by an oppressor rather than the oppressed. Finally, in many communities it is acceptable as part of the in-group to flame the out-group, but not vice-versa. One person&#x27;s &quot;eat shit and die&quot; is acceptable, the other person&#x27;s is not.<p>I suppose this could be mitigated by training your own bayesian filter based on your ingroup and your outgroup separately, based on who you designate your ingroup via social network or something.

If Uber wants to come along and take the &quot;cream&quot;, let them. If that means traditional taxi companies go out of business, or have to change their business model and cater to a different segment, then so be it. That&#x27;s competition, and competition is a good, healthy thing. It keeps us strong. A market that doesn&#x27;t allow this is dysfunctional.<p>If some of these segments are unprofitable and cannot be served by regular businesses, then that&#x27;s good for us to realize! That encourages us to have the discussion we ought to be having, which is: should we provide these services in pursuit of a social goal? And what are the services worth?<p>I would be much more in favor of cities contracting with private companies to provide a service than passing regulation to require it. Requiring a service by regulation hides the true cost of the service and causes it to be borne in random places and in random ways through price increases. It&#x27;s like a hidden tax.<p>There should be a clear dollar cost for these services in the budget, and voters should be able to inspect the costs and decide what&#x27;s reasonable. Requiring private companies to provide the service through regulation does not promote a transparent democracy, since voters cannot easily determine the cost, and indeed the actual cost may be hard to determine.<p>For example, if the city wishes there to be a certain number of vehicles available for the disabled, then a reasonable and fair approach is to ask private transportation companies to bid on a contract to provide that service. The city should be satisfied paying the lowest bid for that service. If the lowest price is viewed as too high, then this is a signal that either some political debate is needed regarding the budget for such things, or that the resources should be spent on another social goal which provides value more effectively.<p>Far too many different issues are bundled together in the discussions of taxis.

Random Forests work well because as ensemble methods they can be optimized to explore many different aspects of a data set, but they don&#x27;t perform significantly better than SVMs or most of the other methods.<p>In practice the solution is often to <i>use a combination of multiple methods</i>. Trees, support vector machines, multilayer perceptrons, gaussian kernels, bagging and boosting. In most applications you don&#x27;t have choose. Combining the results of all of them together using a weighted average will out perform any of them individually. And in most cases, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each classifier fits a given data set differently and provides its own perspective on the prediction problem. The goal isn&#x27;t to choose the best one, but to find an ensemble of methods that best explain the patterns and relationships in the data.<p>There are many cases where resource and speed limitations dictate that only one classifier can be tuned and implemented, and in those situations it&#x27;s good to know which one is &#x27;best&#x27;.

Five years ago, pretraining was how everyone attacked this problem, although they usually did a different kind of pretraining (basically, we train a different kind of model, and then perform surgery, cutting it apart and using some layers for it for the earlier layers of our model).<p>More recently, people, especially the younger generation of deep learning researchers, tend to be skeptical of how much pretraining helps.<p>Advocates for pretraining now tend to argue that it helps you find better local minima, instead of focusing on it helping the vanishing gradient problem. For example, see this paper: <a href=""http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/erhan10a/erhan10a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/erhan10a/erhan10a.pdf</a> .<p>As I&#x27;m sure Michael will address in coming chapters, there&#x27;s a bunch of tricks you can use that make training deep neural networks a lot easier.

I meant that they way it was told in the company how AAA do it sounded similar to what I learned about how big companies done it 10 or something years ago. Coming from agile workplace, I think there were things that could have been kept in place to improve quality of life for developers and art teams. I&#x27;m not sure if I can express what I mean correctly. For example, why the dreaded &quot;crunch time&quot; in gaming is treated as norm, while in modern web/mobile shops its believed that something like this is going to result in worse quality over time?<p>I could see arguing here with myself that AAA games are usually &quot;ship and forget&quot;, with some bugfixes only. Maybe because company I was working in was not AAA, but small (by industry standards) f2p mobile shop, where applying AAA ideas is not that great (in my opinion). I mean that&#x27;s where your product is more along lines of web apps - you are going to constantly add content, update code base, refine features, so focusing on quality in long term is better. This, thought, I was not able to articulate clearly and properly to AAA veterans.<p>I feel like not all ideas from current practises can be applied to big gaming studios, but saying that I believe it can be improved. This may need time and risk that companies that are big enough to be called AAA are not willing to take.<p>Why two companies you mentioned failed? I think we can assume there might be more reasons to that than only being Agile, maybe their games were just not that good, or IP was boring? Still you sound like you have more experience than me here, I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around whole AAA industry thing. I&#x27;m ranting about it so much because making games was way more entertaining than web/mobile, but the industry is so poisonous for pure developers that I had to quit to regain my sanity :)",1418095492

Without being privy to their investigation we don&#x27;t know what all led to that ongoing concern, but it&#x27;s plausible to assume they have reasons.<p>Second, it may be that MIT&#x27;s policy in these cases is to formally cut all ties with the harasser, or something to that effect. This might be the online equivalent of insisting that a disgraced emeritus professor give up their office on campus. There are clearly downsides to the community for such a policy, but there are indisputable benefits as well.<p>And finally, it strikes me that MIT has very little leverage to punish a retired professor who damages the university&#x27;s reputation and community in this way. But this action of taking down a big part of his life&#x27;s work is a way of hitting him right in his legacy. I know that were I in his shoes, I would be devastated by such a decision.

My issues with Xcode isn&#x27;t the lack of buttons, it&#x27;s the lack of functionality.

Encoding high-level categorical variables as unordered integers, or even frequency count maps, is pretty common practice, but really only valid (as the author says) in tree based methods. Given deep enough trees (or enough iterations in the boosting scenario), it is my anecdotal experience that trees are able to parse out relevant values. The problem with indicator variables in general is the enormous potential loss in computational time and increase in complexity. My models have hundreds of vehicle/car types, U.S. state, etc., and so this type of coding helps quite a bit in performance without sacrificing (and sometimes improving due to curse-of-dimensionality) model performance (IMHO YMMV)",1418094741

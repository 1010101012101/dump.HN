It sounds like you think that any murderer who can hide a body and clean a crime scene should be impossible to convict.<p>There's nothing wrong with circumstantial evidence. It's used all the time. The ambiguity you're having trouble coping with is the reason we have juries and strict rules regarding admissability.",1209427182

176121,comment,176098,176098,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I worked with Hans and his team a few years back on an experimental ReiserFS-based filesystem for Squid (still the fastest Squid ever, as far as I know), and find the whole thing difficult to believe.  He very likely suffers from Aspergers (""suffers"" in this case, since it seems to have led to his conviction due to his insistence on taking the stand and deep misunderstanding of human nature and how his behavior would appear to others...it seems to be a beneficial condition for some folks, ordinarily, at least with regard to productivity, but when it comes to a jury they aren't likely to be your peers), or a similar condition, and I always found his famously obstinate behavior more amusing than threatening.<p>I, of course, have no idea if he committed the crime, but I find his bizarre explanations far more believable than the jury.  He really is just that kind of person...a bit paranoid, extremely analytical, and significantly smarter than the vast majority of people.  This is true even among extremely smart folks, like those on the Linux kernel mailing list, he's probably among the smartest in the conversation.  But he's also lacking in many social skills to the point that his involvement in a discussion usually hurts more than helps--reading his numerous arguments on the LKML is like seeing a warm up for his bizarre performance on the stand.<p>So, one could make the case that Hans' feeling of superiority, which might be hard to avoid for someone as smart as he is, and his paranoia combined to produce this very result.  Perhaps he figured he'd get away with it, because he's so much smarter than everyone else.  And perhaps his paranoia convinced him that Nina had plans to steal away with his children and he'd never see them again (there is some evidence that this was actually her plan).  Since the average American has a rather deeply ingrained mistrust of really smart people, his particularly ornery and superior attitude certainly didn't help him.<p>I genuinely like Hans, and think very highly of him as a developer...so I'm not going to spend a lot of time dwelling on the uncomfortable thoughts of whether he committed the crime or not.  I'll just hope that if he did, he gets some help for his mental illness while imprisoned (I'm assuming that if he did it, it's due to his paranoia being far worse than is apparent in his public persona), and that he's able to accept responsibility for the act.  And, if he didn't do it, I hope that something comes out that exonerates him before he's too old to enjoy a return to freedom.",1209426673
176120,comment,176098,176098,0,0,breily,,,"Regardless of whether he did it or not, this seems like a failure of the justice system - sentencing someone to 25 years in prison for a murder in which there is ""no body, no crime scene, no reliable eyewitness and virtually no physical evidence"".

176119,comment,175840,176063,0,0,sovande,,,"Most developers working on open source software see no problem and love working in open source project. This is because most open source developers work for a large company, such as IBM or Sun. These companies of course use open source software to sell services which pays so much better than selling shrink wrapped software. Must better to push 30 junior consultants through the poor customers door for 2 years than simply selling software.<p>Look at the Linux commit log, 80-90% of new code comes from corporate open source drones.<p>However, every independent developer that has been working on a fairly successful open source project for a couple of years will become bitter at times and to some degree. Even Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite hints about this in the google video where he discuss SQLite.<p>The reason is simple, after the first fun of working on a new project, there is very little incitement to continue. a) There is no money to be had, donation does not work in the sense of putting salt on your table. b) Selling services does not work, because most users don't need support or if they do, support will already be provided be lots of ""open source"" consulting companies selling services for your product. c) Most user feedback is rude and usually complaints about missing feature or bugs and d) you are usually alone. Its a myth that most open source project are run by a merry band of altruistic developers. Usually they are run by 1-2 developers for the love of the craft - at first. No wonder these independent developers become bitter if they continue for some reason. And the worst part, if he should dare complain a bit, he only get smug stupid remarks from idiots like yourself who have never contributed a line of code in your whole life.",1209426333

But I still believe it's a Good Idea to play safe until broader legal fallout is definitively ruled out one way or another.

I'm not scared of learning it, but if I am going to dream of pie-in-the-sky, I might as well dream of a world where one language gets things done on the web.<p>[1] I would suggest Lisp here, but honestly I got started with Scheme, and for some reason (purely aesthetic), CL just seems so ugly to me.",1209424191

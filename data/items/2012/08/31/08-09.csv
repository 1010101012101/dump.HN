Paid users make heavy use of the service and active users make good use up to the free limit.<p>Without giving away product details publicly, we're looking for some general advice on where you all think we should start on marketing this ourselves (two founders, both technical, determined to tackle the marketing problem without taking anyone else on).<p>Do our numbers look about right? (paid users to total users) or should we work on converting more free users to paid users?\nDo our numbers look good and should we just concentrate on bringing in more traffic/users and keeping up the conversion rate?\nShould we look at 'inactive' users first and figure out if we can persuade them to start using the service and become paid users?<p>Thanks",1346401752

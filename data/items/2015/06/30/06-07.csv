The US has about 100 F-22&#x27;s which are used primarily for national defense.\nThe bulk of the F-35&#x27;s were supposed to go to the Navy which is the defacto offensive air force of the US armed forces which cannot fly F-22&#x27;s off their carriers which means they&#x27;ll actually need a fighter which is capable in CAP / A2A roles.<p>But we&#x27;ll see what comes out in the end of that, the 1st country which will get the F-35 as early as late 2015/early 2016 is supposed to be Israel, they are getting their own version which will include a different engine and their own avionic package.\nAnd the IAF doesn&#x27;t care about BVR despite having what is arguably the best A2A BVR/WVR missile currently in service the Python-5, their doctrine is go for the gun kill and that anything else doesn&#x27;t count.<p>That said you can find similar reservations in pilots going from Gen 2 jet fighters to Gen 3/3.5 fights like from the Mirage 3 likes to an F-16 losing quite a bit of agility in the process.<p>The F-16 at the time was the 1st negative stability FBW Jet and quite a few pilots took it to town complaining that it&#x27;s too unresponsive too sluggish and you don&#x27;t fly it but rather the computer flies you.<p>That same issue would&#x27;ve probably been sensationalized just as much as the F-35 if it would&#x27;ve happen today, well the Aircraft will get better and pilots will learn how to use it&#x27;s flight characteristics, so how much of an improvement needs to be done to the F-35 is yet to be seen.",1435647465

9803425,comment,9803043,9803319,0,0,jonathankoren,,,"Dogfighting was supposed to be archaic and improbable in 1968 as well, since who was going to get close and maneuver when you had guided missiles? Then the losses mounted, and they created TOPGUN.<p>What really makes dogfighting unlikely, is the fact that United States hasn&#x27;t fought anyone with airplanes in 40 years.<p>From everything I read, the F-35 is shit for two reasons. First, the Pentagon hadn&#x27;t learned it&#x27;s lessons from all the other times they tried to make one fighter for every service which almost always has failed. (The F-4 being the notable exception.) And Second, the Marines insisted on a damn VSTOL aircraft. Really, it&#x27;s the Marines&#x27;s fault. If ignored them (and really you should, because they&#x27;re just insisting on duplicated effort), then you&#x27;d have much narrower, and thus maneuverable, airframe. The reason why the airframe is so wide, is because it must accommodate a lift-fan than isn&#x27;t even installed in the Air Force and Navy versions. Even when the lift-fan is installed, the extra weight, and the need to take off and land vertically, causes the Marine version to have less range and less armaments. If you had cut the Marines out, you would have gotten the <a href=&quot;<a href=""http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/amazing-photos-of-chinas-newest-stealth-jet-show-growin-1657003826&quot;>J-31</a>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/amazing-photos-of-chinas-ne...</a>.<p>It&#x27;s really a shitty plane, and what really pisses me off about it, is that this seems to be incredibly common place anymore.

9803414,comment,9800987,9800987,0,0,facepalm,,,"London is not creating the prices of property, the people are. They will be prepared to pay as much as they think living in London is worth. If eventually all the cool stuff is driven out by the high prices, prices will fall accordingly. Or rather, presumably there will be an equilibrium of prices vs coolness.<p>It kind of sucks, but what would actually be a better system? That people get assigned places to live by lottery, so if you happen to live in a cool place on the cheap, you were simply lucky? It sounds good on the surface because you only have the people living there in your mind. You forget about all the other people who never get a chance of living there. Why is it fair if some randomly selected people get to live in nice places and others don&#x27;t?<p>I am not convinced that the market approach is not preferable. After all, those people PAY for the privilege to live in a cool place. If they have the money, presumably they should have delivered something good to the world in exchange.<p>And, hello, welcome to overpopulation. The number of nice places to live is finite. Even if we can cram ever more and more people into the world (by building skyscrapers or whatever), it doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to me that we can provide nice places for everyone. For example, the length of shorelines is finite (glossing over fractal issues), so if your idea of living in a nice place is to live by the sea, there are only so many people who can have that privilege.",1435647229

They asked me to join on an equal share basis and asked me to lead the dev team in Chile and relocate from Germany for that. That one guy came over for just the first month. I was not a beneficiary of the incubator and after a month in Chile, we had to found a company and that company was to be owned by only two of the four founders, with &quot;that guy&quot; putting himself at 50%. I brought up the topic in a skype meeting with 15 supporters and at the time I had figured that mentioning that I signed up for 25% of the cake might get people angry and &quot;that guy&quot; yelled at me he would fly down to Chile and kick my butt … anyway, long story short, I took my hat and our Chilean founding partner made sure I got my 90% reembursement of the reembursable money I had put in, and 100% of what I paid to our developers to make them good for what &quot;that guy&quot; and the other German partner didn&#x27;t pay.<p>At the time, I was super stressed and worried and tried to document everything in case it will be of relevance later on.<p>Yeah, that was three years ago and I&#x27;m forever thankful for our Chilean partner that took a great financial hit later on when the startup finally went down but that I only heard second hand …<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m still in Chile and like it here.<p>Not all startups will be the next Facebook.

By all accounts, Uber is worlds better than foodservice, unless you count both the lack of disability insurance (workers comp functions as a sort of disability insurance for most people)  and massively increased danger (driving a car is one of the more dangerous jobs available)   -  but certainly for the right now?   the people I know who work for uber?  they are so happy to not have to work foodservice.   And the schedule control?  the schedule control is unheard of for unskilled labor jobs.   If you don&#x27;t know anyone who works retail, it&#x27;s not like being an engineer, where so long as I show up between 8:00 and 11:30AM, the boss is cool.  No, not only do they have to stick to a schedule, but that schedule changes from week to week and even day to day.    Uber lets these people have, if not full schedule flexibility, at least more schedule flexibility than I get.<p>I... don&#x27;t think I could handle an unskilled job for more than a month.  I&#x27;d get fired for showing up late, or quit after one too many customers laid in to me because they were having a bad day.<p>So...  yeah, even without the disability insurance, I think I&#x27;d choose an uber driving job over a fast food job.  And if uber loses the appeal? (what happened with that, anyhow?) and is forced to pay on a W2 basis and cover worker&#x27;s comp?  That problem will be solved, too.<p>(oh yeah, as an aside, if I ran uber?  I&#x27;d tell my lawyer to take a fall; to make damn sure we &quot;lost&quot; that case.   Uber is far better placed to absorb the extra costs associated with paying drivers as employees than any of the other ride-sharing companies.)<p>>On top of all of that, I believe they&#x27;re a great example of the shift back to a new gilded age, where the main function of the poor is to directly serve the wealthy. But instead of a Victorian model where employees are part of the household, in the Uber model we&#x27;ll get paid only during the instants we are directly useful to somebody with money.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not defending uber on any of the other counts; or this one, really;  you aren&#x27;t wrong.  Especially on the bit about wanting the convenience of having servants without wanting to deal with the <i>relationship</i>  -<p>You could make the argument that the new arrangement is more respectful to the workers;  when the uber driver is off shift, she is my social equal, and that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> true of the Victorian model.   It&#x27;s certainly a hell of a lot less paternalistic.<p>Of course, you certainly have a point that the new model is less stable.  (I return again to the worker&#x27;s comp issue)<p>But the truth of the matter is that it sucks to be poor.  It always has, really, and it probably always will.<p>I&#x27;m just saying, when you compare working for Uber to the other choices an &quot;unskilled&quot; person has, it doesn&#x27;t look so bad.   Being poor sucks, sure.  but I think being poor and driving for Uber is probably better than being poor and working at McDonalds or target or what have you.    (minus, of course, that disability insurance thing, which, I guess, could actually be a pretty big deal, considering the increased chance of disability that comes from driving all day)<p>I think that if the disability insurance problem was solved (say, by Uber losing that court case) then if Uber or similar services increases the demand for professional drivers, that might be a win-win for both the poor, who get slightly better jobs, and the upper middle, who don&#x27;t have to drive as much.<p>(I need a better word than &quot;unskilled&quot;  - I highly doubt I could maintain a minimum uber driver rating.  I&#x27;m a below-average driver, and while I could maintain that level of social function for eight hours, I&#x27;d find it pretty draining;  just that level of social interaction, for me?  I&#x27;d be able to pull it off two, maybe three days a week.)",1435646106

Now we find out that, as everyone knew, it can&#x27;t dogfight. So why even design it to do a mediocre job of dogfighting when they could equivalently eliminate that design constraint and allow it to do its other roles better?<p>The simple fact is that the military has tried to bite off more than it can chew by asking that the F-35 can do everything at once. Because the F-35A is slated to replace the F-16, other sacrifices have been made to make it sort of approach being kind of nearly as capable as the F-16. As a result, it is doing its other roles worse than what would be the case if the military instead accepted that one size does not fit all and removed that requirement.<p>Frankly, it doesn&#x27;t matter how unrealistic the idea of dogfighting is. The military said &#x27;make this thing able to dogfight at least equivalently to the F-16&#x27; so LM have gone away and made specific design decisions to try to achieve that.

And the side effects (memory operations) are unimportant and beyond the control of the programmer. So you can do all sorts of transformation on the code without effecting the end result.<p>C is definitely impure. There is a large set usage cases where the memory layouts are important. Where the orders of operation and memory accesses are important.<p>What I worry about is when the optimizer is allowed to make assumptions about undefined behavior, that may be actually important on certain targets. Consider referencing a null pointer.<p>Winows7, Linux, in user land if you do that and you&#x27;ll get a seg fault. And if the default handler runs your program dies.<p>The ARM cortex processor I&#x27;ve been slopping code for, reading a null pointer returns the initial stack pointer. Writing generates a bus fault. Since I actually trap that, and error message gets written into non-initialize memory and then the processor gets forcibly reset.<p>On an AVR reading a null pointer gives you the programs entry point. Writing to that location typically does nothing. Though you can write to it if running out of a special &#x27;boot sector&#x27; and you&#x27;ve done some magic incantations.<p>So that&#x27;s the problem I have with the idea that &#x27;undefined means the optimizer can make hash of your program&#x27; instead of trusting the back end of the compiler will do something target appropriate.",1435645469

Despite developmental issues, the F-35 Head-Mounted Display has been completed and displays imagery in a complete sphere (4pi steradian) from the aircraft&#x27;s Distributed Aperture System. Additionally, the F-35 has a somewhat roomier cockpit than the F-16, though rear visibility is more obstructed.<p>The control systems are still being tuned to some extent as well.

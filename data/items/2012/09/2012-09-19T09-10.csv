Or really in any interaction. If you didn't read about iOS or never used one of these devices, the home button is _not_ intuitive to figure out. Ignoring all the following warts and hidden features.<p>So your recollection of your Android experience is probably spot on, but not surprising for me.

Granted, I didn't get the wrong color, but it rides around in my purse unprotected and has held up better than either the cable that came with my 3GS (frayed right where the cable meets the connector in under a month; it was a complete piece of crap), or the cheap monoprice cables I originally replaced my cable with (bought a 3-pack, good thing, only one held up past 3 months). I never took the MySaver off it to inspect the build quality of the actual cable, but it seems to be fairly well constructed to me. Better than the OEM one at least.<p>Now the very first Kickstarter I ever backed... it was to cover the editing and production costs of a documentary that was supposedly already completely filmed, it just needed to be put together. Funded in early Feb 2011 and not a single update on the project or comment from the creator since that day either. Still bummed about that one - I genuinely wanted to see the documentary, and my pledge was supposed to get me a copy of the DVD.",1348048404

4542875,comment,4540719,4542394,2,0,dalke,,,"""which is all he was asking of Google""<p>He was asking for funding. For funding, you need to convince people that it's worthwhile. There are many ways to do that. One is to say ""trust me"", another is to persuade through education, a third is to use money which was promised for another purpose, and so on.<p>He used the first approach. Only, he did it in a way that's similar to what a lot of kooks do - throw graphs up on a screen, without the time to review them, and on a topic which few in the audience will understand. That is not a way to convince people to fund your project.<p>You say ""That tends to be how geniuses talk."" That is incorrect. Look at Fermi, Feynman, Gould, Sagan - all considered geniuses, and all renowned for their ability to explain things. Darwin's ""The Origin of Species"" was meant for a wide audience, and was not a technical monograph. Freeman Dyson has written some marvelous essays, including his ""A New Newton"" book review of Gleick's Newton biography. Just take a look at the Nobel Prize lectures and you'll see good evidence that Nobel Prize winners are also able to explain their work using something other than a blizzard of viewgraphs. Those people are ones I admire.<p>Instead, I think this sort of presentation tends to be the way that people who are convinced of their genius-ness talk. And again, it's the sort of way kooks talk.<p>I want to be clear here. I'm not saying that he's a kook. The polywell reactor may be the power source of the future. But that presentation detracted from his goal, I presume, of getting funding for the project. Really, if you didn't know it was Bussard, would you be convinced? If I had given the same talk, in the same style, would you be willing to contribute $10 million in funding?",1348048230

4542851,comment,4532922,4542422,1,0,einhverfr,,,"It's too late to post on your blog, unfortuanately (great article btw) but I think your article hits the nail on the head.  A couple points I would make though is that I don't see anything wrong really with using an ORM plus views to encapsulate data.  INSERT INTO invoice isn't all that bad if invoice is a view.  Data operations are still encapsulated.<p>The second point is that I am a relative fan of loosely coupled systems.  Loose coupling gets away from CAP theorem problems because each system is autonomous and can always defer interop with other applications until later.  On the other hand your centralized RDBMS goes down and every app that needs it dies with it.  How many apps we want entangled in that way is a business decision but there are tradeoffs on both sides.<p>That doesn't mean endorsing the NoSQL approach though.  I maintain that you can't have ""eventual consistency"" in any meaningful, guaranteed way unless you always have ""absolute local consistency"" within some scope.  Postgres-XC defines that scope as cluster-wide.  In a loosely coupled system it could be each individual node.  For this reason BASE doesn't work for anything that is important.  It reduces to:<p>Best-guess Attempt at Semi-consistent Eventualities.<p>Lesson is:  not only do you want to encapsulate your data, but anywhere that you want eventual consistency, you need to have local ACID compliance for some defined scope of local.  This is a big issue that NoSQL db's have and that they cannot solve (due to CAP theorem issues).  If only it were absent from the RDBMS world.  I groan every time someone asks for ""multi-master asynchronous replication.""",1348047556

4542826,comment,4541839,4542636,7,0,rayiner,,,"First, there are a lot of lawyers engaged directly in public service. Lawyers work at non-profits, as public defenders, and for the government. A number of my friends (say 1 in 10) from law school had the grades to make $150k+ at a large law firm and didn't even apply to such jobs, instead taking $45k/year jobs as public defenders. While DOJ is often used as a political tool, the rank-and-file there are true believers, mostly top graduates from top schools who could make twice as much in the private sector. Now, to be perfectly fair the large majority of lawyers do work in the private sector, but even there public service is institutionalized in a way it isn't in other professions. The majority of lawyers at any large law firm do at least some pro bono work. Last year, attorneys at my big Wall Street law firm did on average over two working weeks worth of pro bono. Nearly all law firms count at least a week or two of pro bono towards yearly hours requirements. Nowhere near 10% of my engineering friends went to go work at non-profits for low pay, and I know very few engineers that donate that much work for free.<p>Second, law has lagged the rest of corporate America culturally. Over the last 50 years, corporate America has replaced independent ethical principles with the ""ethics of the market."" The business culture has internalized the idea that the purpose of corporations is to maximize profit for their shareholders to the point here people genuinely believe that anything legal that maximizes profit is not only good business but rather morally righteous. The legal profession is one of the last places where people use the word ""fairness"" without it being the punchline to some joke about things that are only relevant in grade school. Obviously you see more of this in the judiciary or among public service lawyers than at big Wall Street firms, but even lawyers defending big evil corporations have a constitutional discomfort with bending the rules too much--after all without rules a lawyer's life would be without meaning.<p>Third, law is as a profession very self-conscious about it's special role in the economy. Lawyer's attitudes towards their ethical codes are more similar to that of accountants than say that of financial service professionals. Part of this is the constitutional preoccupation with rules, but the other part is basic self-interest. In the financial sector, there are little to no consequences, other than some bad press, for selling a client on a bad deal while taking the other side yourself. In the legal sector, breaches of ethical duties to clients trigger the professional death penalty (disbarment). People have this image of scummy lawyers lying and cheating to benefit their clients, but very few lawyers like their clients enough to risk their own livelihoods on their behalf. Every single admitted lawyer went through an invasive ""character and fitness"" investigation before the state licensing boards, an investigation so thorough it digs into sealed juvenile records and verifies the consistency of facts on your law school applications. I was quite shocked at how much more seriously my classmates in law school took the Honor Code than my classmates in engineering school... Now, you certainly do see lawyers lobby for laws that create more work for them, but it's kindergarten stuff compared to businesses that lobby to be allowed to externalize more of the costs of their activity onto workers in the form of workplace hazards, or banks that lobby to be allowed to take more risks with their depositors' money. When I was working as an engineer in the defense industry, it wasn't like we scrupulously avoided opportunities to make ourselves relevant (""now that you've invaded Iraq, you might want to look at our product..."")<p>Now, I don't want to oversell my case. There are a lot of scummy lawyers, especially of the personal injury kind. And most lawyers who make a good living do it by defending big evil corporations. But you know what? There are lots of scummy people everywhere and everyone works for those big evil corporations anyway. And unlike lawyers those people don't swear to follow an ethical code that makes it a punishable ethical violation to not rat out your friends.",1348047035

A few well-recognized researchers openly and publicly admit that Rossi's research appears promising and deserves more research (such as Dennis M.

Saaspose.Barcode provides two approaches used to create barcode. Firstly, you can upload the desired file to Saaspose Storage using Saaspose REST API. Then you can generate barcode image using Saaspose.Barcode REST examples. You can also use Saaspose.Barcode SDK examples for generating the barcode image from the file uploaded on Saaspose Storage for different languages like .NET, Java, Ruby and PHP. Another way is to directly generate barcode image on your local system using Saaspose.Barcode REST API and SDKs without saving the file to Saaspose Storage. You can use the file path or stream to generate barcode image using Saaspose.Barcode REST API. The file is sent through request stream to Saaspose servers, processed and the output is sent back as response stream. In this case, the file is not saved on Saaspose Storage. It is a single call process that uploads the file to server, generates the barcode image, sends the generated image as response stream and deletes the source file from the server.",1348046358

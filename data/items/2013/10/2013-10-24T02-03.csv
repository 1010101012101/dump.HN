It may not be hand-wavy object magic.. but let&#x27;s be real about this: we&#x27;re not a future-oriented culture anymore. We&#x27;re all about the present. Lots has been written about this elsewhere.<p>The secret to creating advanced tools is to minimize the magic. Crazy powerful tools still require the expert user to have a predictive mental model of what is really going on so that accurate decisions can be made and valuable experiences can be accumulated on the learning curve.<p>I would say, though, that the programming we do is by its very nature futuristic. So few humans have been able to interact with information the way programmers today do. The tool churn and huge volume of ideas and trials that we&#x27;re going through will, eventually, become a mainstream way of working with ideas. It may take a long time.<p>The other thing is.. a hammer may seem like a simple and obvious tool, but there is still a huge gap between an expert and a novice when it comes to pounding nails. You still need a lot of practice.",1382583580
6603173,comment,6601748,6602641,2,0,Jtsummers,,,"Lisp and Smalltalk are not on the standard curriculum at most US schools. I know that GT used to offer an OO course (speaking of abandoning history, can&#x27;t view old course webpages past 2008, and new ones are apparently hidden behind a student only portal) which used Squeak, it was a co-requisite of Software Engineering (circa 2003, don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s changed since because I can&#x27;t get to the pages). I wasn&#x27;t introduced to lisp until I took a special topics course that used Common Lisp for AI in grad school. Ok, technically I used scheme before then in a survey of programming languages course, but 2 weeks exposure hardly counts. For various reasons I left GT about that time, and finished up elsewhere. I do know that in 2002 (2001?) they introduced scheme for CS 1301 (whatever the number changed to), but dropped it for python later (cheating scandal that year, something like 200 students caught in CS 1 and CS 2).<p>Speaking of, that PL course was probably the closest to a CS history course that I ever took. The only other courses that came close were ones where I deliberately sought out papers on algorithms (AI, graphics) that had been developed in the 70s/80s relevant to projects I was working on. Other students just brute forced their solutions taking advantage of the much faster hardware available at the time.",1382583579

I think individuals come to their own conclusions about morality, but those conclusions are informed by the information that they receive from their environment and community. A person who never experiences meaningful debate, thought, or contemplation is going to be morally stunted compared to those who engage in regular debate and discussion. That doesn&#x27;t mean every person who argues a point is morally superior, but in the aggregate, engaging in moral discussions will enhance an individuals expertise in determining moral veracity.",1382583538

I had an iPad before but after I got my Surface (both RT and Pro) I found myself using the tablet for more stuff and I found myself having it with me much more and enjoying it. I&#x27;ve used Surface Pro for work (Visual Studio, Office) and it&#x27;s been working good.<p>Regarding the keyboard and not having a desk, with Surface 2 it is supposedly better as you have one more angle with the kickstand. I love the TypeCover when I am by a desk, never really found TouchCover that enjoyable to write on.<p>Here&#x27;s some of the prices:<p>Surface 2 with 32GB is $449<p>Surface 2 with 64GB is $549<p>Surface 2 pro with  64GB is $899<p>Surface 2 pro with  128GB is $999<p>Surface 2 pro with  256GB is $1,299<p>Surface 2 pro with  512GB is $1,799<p>iPad 2 with 16GB is $399<p>iPad Air with 16GB is $499<p>iPad Air with 32GB is $599<p>iPad Air with 64GB is $699<p>iPad Air with 128GB is $799",1382583302
6603157,comment,6603008,6603008,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"I will have to side with Microsoft here, everything said is in-fact true. The Surface from a technical perspective trumps the iPad, it&#x27;s effectively a true computer (USB ports, storage options) inside of a tablet form. In all honesty, it was never Apple that was focused, it was Steve Jobs. When Jobs was at the helm, he did things differently to everyone else and it was this different approach that got Apple to where it is now. The legacy that Steve Jobs created is being carried on, albeit rather loosely. It&#x27;s obvious Apple are losing their way very slowly, we can&#x27;t forget that the iPad and iPhone were both masterminded by Jobs and Johnny. I mean seriously, the iPad Air? It has nothing to gloat about except being lighter, but was the iPad ever that heavy to warrant being lighter? It already weighed less than some books can way.<p>Microsoft don&#x27;t get enough credit, they&#x27;ve done a lot of things wrong, but I think the Surface is a solid device that doesn&#x27;t get enough attention. The price point was definitely wrong, if you want to rival Apple you have to undercut them in the market. Most people don&#x27;t buy Apple devices because of technical specs, they buy them because of the large library of applications, the hype around owning an Apple device and the look and feel. When is the last time you heard someone saying they were going to buy an iPad because of the kind of CPU it has?<p>The iPad and Surface Pro 2 are both fantastic devices that can achieve the same things. The software is different, but on a hardware level they are both highly capable devices with seemingly limitless potential. Apple has the better OS for the moment and the better design, but Microsoft has the better hardware. For those that have used both iWork and Microsoft Office, it&#x27;s obvious that Microsoft wins hands down. You never see anything other than Microsoft office being used in the enterprise and I doubt you ever will in this lifetime.<p>If you want to win accolades and praise, making fun of the competition in this way makes you look like a jealous douche, both Apple and Microsoft come across as childish to me. Once upon a time Apple in terms of their public presence and marketing never really mentioned the competition but based on remarks that Tim Cook made, it&#x27;s obvious their strategy is to no longer take the high ground and let the consumer make their choice, they&#x27;re playing hard-ball with Microsoft and Samsung now.",1382583286

And once that store of value starts to rise more in price, that just accelerates the trend. It is speculation but not random speculation.

I don&#x27;t need an allocation the size of my address space in order to want to address both the first and last bytes in the address space.<p>That&#x27;s a pointer issue.

Pretty much all tablets do that.<p>The problem with this statement is that its not relatively easy.

Perhaps the limitations that really matter is how we think about programming.

Zynga - which is what I consider a web startup - has been at the origin of a revolution in the <i>game industry</i>. At the same time Activision did with Call Of Duty, this is one of the first company which leads the XP + items revolution. That was the first time you saw XP + items in a game from another style than RPG. This is also the reason of the success of the Call Of Duty franchise: COD 4 was the first FPS to have XP + item which were previously reserved to RPGs. 
Nowday, you can&#x27;t find a game without XP + items. These things came from companies outside the game industry - except Activision and a very - very - few others.<p>The <i>energy</i> for example is now a main game design and monetization component you find in many, many video games published by the industry now and this is Zynga&#x27;s invention.

Some excerpts (with emphasis added to a few key concepts):<p># # #<p>The Coordinate Plane<p>All information about location or movement is given to QuickDraw in terms of coordinates on a plane. The coordinate plane is a two-dimensional grid, as illustrated in Figure 2.<p>Note the following features of the QuickDraw coordinate plane:<p> All grid coordinates are integers (in the range -32767 to 32767).<p> <i>All grid lines are infinitely thin.</i><p>These concepts are important. First, they mean that the QuickDraw plane is finite, not infinite (although it&#x27;s very large). Second, they mean that all elements represented on the coordinate plane are mathematically pure. Mathematical calculations using integer arithmetic will produce intuitively correct results. <i>If you keep in mind that grid lines are infinitely thin, you&#x27;ll never have &quot;endpoint paranoia&quot;the confusion that results from not knowing whether that last dot is included in the line.</i><p>Points<p>There are 4,294,836,224 unique points on the coordinate plane. Each point is at the intersection of a horizontal grid line and a vertical grid line. <i>As the grid lines are infinitely thin, so a point is infinitely small.</i><p>Figure 3 shows the relationship between points, grid lines, and. pixels, the physical dots on the screen. (<i>Pixels correspond to bits in memory</i>, as described in the next section.)<p>Rectangles<p>Any two points can define the top left and bottom right corners of a rectangle. As these points are infinitely small, <i>the borders of the rectangle are infinitely thin</i> (see Figure 4).<p># # #<p>The full PDF is available here (or via a search for &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot;), and it&#x27;s better with the illustrations:<p><a href=""http://www.pagetable.com/?p=50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pagetable.com/?p=50</a><p>The description of the QuickDraw coordinate plane is on pages 148-151 (I-138 to I-141).<p>Figure 3 is especially good.

Emails from outside recruiters != decent job offers. Recruiters are drawn to warm bodies, so they&#x27;ll talk to anyone who they think they might be able to put in front of a company. While some companies choose to work with them, keep in mind that because a relatively small percentage of new hires typically come through recruiters, candidates brought to a company via one are often at a disadvantage right off the bat.<p>3.

Once you enter your location and legal issue/problem, you can instantly book an appointment with a lawyer near you who has expertise in the area of your concern.

This allows for the most optimum matching of clients with the properly qualified attorney.<p>LawNearMe.com was founded by Sam Shusterhoff, a lawyer himself, with the mission to improve and modernize consumer&#x27;s access to legal assistance. Sam decided to start this venture after repeatedly hearing stories of how difficult it was for people to connect with the right lawyer for them (i.e. issue, location, fee, etc.). He created a website where people could not only find the perfect attorney, but took it step further and produced a website that allows the consumer to book a consultation with the attorney instantly from the website.<p>LawNearMe is free for all consumers looking for an attorney and provides multiple subscription plans for attorneys to be listed on the site.

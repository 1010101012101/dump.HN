331950,story,,,3,6,motoko,Humility,,"Response to ""Reflections of a YC Dropout"" http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=330470<p>""Be humble"" is bad advice. Humility isn't an independent trait like ""smart"" that means ""self-critical."" It's socially contextual that means ""benevolently knows his place."" For example, Jesus is the most humble man possible, yet he claimed to be God. Yet, a nerd is openly disrespected for merely claiming to be good at video games. Jesus was so humble that even him _existing_ was a sacrifice. Yet, a nerd is disrespected the more he tries to do anything, and nerds are notoriously self-critical.<p>So ""humility"" can't simply mean ""self-critical."" Yet, when one _tries_ to be humble, that's what one tries first. The result is arrogant people acting pathetic. When one _is_ humble, it's not self-criticism itself that matters, but the right amount of it.<p>There's something about ""networking"" that attracts people who try to be better and repels by people who are better. I don't know what it is precisely, but it's the difference between that and ""networking"" without the quotes.<p>And, there's something about ""growing out of geeky"" that makes one sensitive to that difference. Maybe the difference _is_ humility.<p>For example, I wrote this post in Paul-Graham-essay style. Does that make me less humble? It doesn't feel humble to post this. It makes me uncomfortable. But, saying that it makes me uncomfortable makes me more comfortable.",1223960280

Still, programming isn't easy, as evidenced by how few people there are to look up to in the field relative to the number of participants, many of them themselves somewhat proficient.<p>Our modern languages let us do things that used to be hard in just a few lines, but that just means that we imagine more ambitious projects - so ambitious, in fact, that we coin all sorts of terms like ""Test-Driven Development,"" which is itself nothing more than a moniker for ""We know that we're not going to get this right the first time, and even if we get it right later, we should frequently verify that something else doesn't break it."" Yes - programming is so easy that changes far away still break things, and despite a lot of theories on modularity and the like, we still don't know how to do it in practice.<p>We all want to figure out how to write better software, but despite all of our languages and methods and collective experiences, we're still not very good at it.

331930,comment,331311,331699,0,0,sfamiliar,,,"i actually attribute that to the overall culture of india.  i was in south india; chennai.  the folks that live there have been in a caste system for a long time -- it's integral to their culture.  when the caste system was abolished it didn't go away, it just manifested differently.  russians can't exist without dictators, indians can't get by without brahmins.<p>at its core, it is a fundamental need for permission.  it's not that indian software developers can't make decisions, and can't make good decisions -- they can.  they're sharp folks.  rather, there's an inherent prohibition within the culture not to jump without being told to.  not to strike out on their own and forge new code.  it's the injunction to wait for orders from a superior, or else face the consequences.  it's a very subtle thing, a cultural trend that's hard to identify the origin of in an individual, just like it's hard to figure out why all americans need to have credit cards.  credit cards are just what we do.  they wait for someone to tell them to do something.<p>it's even more insidious than that, especially if you're closely partnered: if you tell them to do something, and it's a bad idea, 9 times out of 10 they won't correct you.  i, as a fallible human, depend on other people to correct my dumbass mistakes, especially in matters of software development.  no one gets everything right.  that's what's so fantastic about pair programming -- both people get the best judgment of their partner.  if you're paired with an indian, and they perceive that you are in a higher position than they (even if it's on a subconscious level), they'll follow you right into hell, or at least an ill-advised has_many :through relationship, even if they know better.  it's the way they're raised, the way they live.<p>i'm not passing judgments on the culture, it just makes for bad programming partners and strange traffic patterns.",1223958465

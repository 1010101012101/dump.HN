My<p>desire and my wish is to find an agreement with Robin van Persie, extend the<p>contract and stay with us for a longer time. Hopefully we can reach that.

This is the harder part, but try something like the pomodoro method, where you work for 25 minutes, and take a 5 minute break. No distractions at all during that 25 minute period. Once that becomes a habit, it gets much easier.<p>Conversely, if you do find yourself wondering why your doing what your doing, or you have to convince yourself, just think of what you want to accomplish. Is it going to the gym, or working on a side project, or reading more? Just think of the first step. The first step of going to the gym is just getting in the door.

3931437,comment,3928155,3931022,1,0,flom,,,"I'm not a physicist, but my understanding is that the debate about whether or not ""quantum is deterministic"" centers around what your interpretation is of the wave function. I think most physicists, who Penrose would probably criticize, believe the ""Copenhagen Interpretation,"" which says that the wave function of a system is literally the function that, when you take the inner product with its conjugate, gives you the probability distribution of the state of the system, and hence, the state is non-deterministic.<p>The uncertainty principle arises from quantum. Specifically, it's a statement about the commutativity of  operators that act on the wave function, which, going by the Copenhagen interpretation of physics, means it's a consequence of the non-determinism of the universe. I think this is a philosophically satisfying explanation for why getting the state of the universe is impossible.",1336195682
3931436,comment,3927670,3928013,3,0,v-yadli,,,"Agreed.<p>As a native Chinese speaker I'm not sure about how a foreigner feels when he's picking up these chinese chars, but I do feel much better to remember new english words after dividing them into their original form, prefixies and sufficies.Now I can guess for the meaning of an english word even if I have never met it before.<p>My point is, this method can also be applied to studying Chinese. Modern Chinese words are seldom built with a single char(as opposed to the ancient Chineses). A character in Chineses does have some meanings, but not too detailed. I do not have enough linguistic knowledge but it feels like we need ""modifiers"" plus these ""meta meanings"" together to build a word.<p>From the perspective of a programmer let me show you some examples:<p>    -- Meta, means ""sub"", ""child"", ""unit""
  -- Noun, means ""node""
 -- Child node
   -- Noun, means ""system"" (I believe this word comes from English because the pronounciation is similar to ""system"" :-D )
  -- Subsystem
     -- Meta, means ""Ammo"" or ""something moving in high speed""
    -- A small, single unit of ammo(just bullet, not bombs, a bomb is too big to be described by """")
      -- Meta, means ""meta""( :-D ), or ""original""
    -- A ""meta unit"" or ""original unit"" should be an atom shouldn't it?<p>Hope this will make you better understand how we construct words. :-)<p>And for grammar, I think the best way to learn grammar is to   observe how native speakers speak. Every language have some fixed ways so it will be fast for one to adapt to it.",1336195660

But I know that Java Guys like to separate everything from each other. That is not necessarily bad. But it leads sometimes to over engineering. 
Anyway. I like the solution. And the Demo is great! I tried the Maven2 Archetype and the JSP Tutorial, too. Worked both fine for me.",1336195036

Movement is relative, based on your chosen point of origin.<p>But, I guess your question was, how did we learn about the structure of the solar system, planets and orbits and all...<p>By observing the planets, you can map out their path, and you can see that they are not orbiting earth. The only sensible explanation is that all the planets, including Earth, must be orbiting the Sun.<p>Kepler then further observed that the orbits are elliptical, and then postulated Kepler's laws (that planets orbit the sun in an ellipse, with the sun in one of the focuses).",1336194547

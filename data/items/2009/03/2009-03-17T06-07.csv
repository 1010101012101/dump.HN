519546,comment,519433,519529,0,0,pg,,,"I generally tried to err on the side of flexibility, and it seemed more flexible not to require the lengths to match.  I could imagine cases where you might want to use patterns both longer and shorter than the lists they were matched against.  On the other hand, I'm not sure I've ever ended up taking advantage of this.",1237273185
519545,comment,519337,519418,0,0,pieterbreed,,,"There is a rumor going around in the South African Air Force that the South Africans with the help of the Israeli Air Force (who had big ties in the bad old days) figured out a way to shoot the SR71s down. It had to do with a technique called storm-climbing (which was novelized by Wilbur Smith in 'Eagle in the Sky') where a normal fighter aircraft would go full-tilt with maximum weight in a downward trajectory, flatten out the dive, dump excess weight, and start climbing vertically. This way the pilots would get to an altitude where the missiles could get a successful lock, which in this case was far higher than the 'normal' ceiling for these aircraft. From this height they could then fire off the missiles. I'm not at all sure if they ever attempted it, but I'm pretty sure they didn't succeed. Still in interesting thing to hear :)",1237273108

After the .com bust, a lot of Calif. schools (our main market) got their budgets and grants slashed and our business slowed. The bank was really cool about letting us make interest only payments for a while.<p>Eventually, we were able to sell the business for enough to pay off the loan and have a little extra dough.",1237271872

I did check whether the incoming request was allowed to modify each field it was trying to modify.  But the code that decided whether a field was modifiable was using a four variable list to destructure on a five value description of the field.  This caused the variable determining whether a field was modifiable to be bound instead to the value saying whether or not it should be displayed.  Which meant every field that was displayed was modifiable.",1237271555

519518,comment,519290,519290,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's kind of an unfortunate fact of life that high rewards require high risk, and high risk requires frequent failure.  There's basically a continuum between doing what you're told, never taking on any risk, and collecting a steady paycheck, or shooting for the moon at every chance and falling on your face each time.<p>FWIW, I had the same sort of existential crisis when I was about 13, and it was so depressing I almost wanted to kill myself.  However, the real working world is <i>not</i> (always) that bad.  I found it helpful to think of every job as a learning experience.  When you've milked it for everything it's worth, move on and find a new job.  If you don't have any possible new jobs, quit and found a company, take it as far as you can possibly go, and if that's not far enough, go and get another job that'll let you work on the reasons you failed as an entrepreneur.<p>This, BTW, is false:<p>""It's eight hours a day, almost completely absolutely and rigidly, five days a week, for forty-sixty years until one saves sufficiently amidst it all to retire.""<p>Think about it this way: there are grad students that live reasonably comfortably on $25k/year.  A decent computer programmer can easily pull in $75k/year.  So for every year you work, you are ""buying"" two years of freedom, if you're willing to live like a grad student.  Work for a couple years, build up skills, then quit and do what you want with your savings.<p>I know a bunch of people who've put this to really great use.  I funded my first startup - which I spent about 15 months full-time on - entirely with savings from a couple years I spent at a financial software startup.  A friend of mine is a grad student in physics, and managed to save $20K on a grad student salary (think about that for a second: making $25k/year and saving $10k/year of it), then worked as a baker's apprentice for 6 months.  An innkeeper I once met worked in Silicon Valley for about 15-20 years, lived like grad students with his wife and son, and then bought a sailboat, sailed around the world, finally settled in Seward, Alaska, and bought an inn with their savings.<p>The whole point of money is that you have a <i>choice</i> of what you want to spend it on.  You can buy time as easily as you can buy things.",1237271410

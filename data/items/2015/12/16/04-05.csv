10742480,comment,10720218,10724640,0,0,heurist,,,">Well you&#x27;re probably right, but I don&#x27;t think that you can do too much, realistically, to regulate early access to very fresh ideas through networks like that - and I think that&#x27;s fine so long as there&#x27;s no purposeful or unnecessary delay in spreading the information more widely.<p>Keep the team distributed across the world and make all communication surrounding the projects open as well. If it&#x27;s for the world it should be by the world.<p>>You could for instance make the same kind of point about YC companies&#x27; access to investor networks, advice of partners, all those sorts of things which aren&#x27;t explicitly reserved just for them but of course are more readily accessible by virtue of being in the program. It&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s inherently bad, it&#x27;s just how it works.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t argue that, that&#x27;s just how business works. I would argue that the founders are playing OpenAI up as humanitarian aid when really it disproportionately benefits them (autonomous cars, paid for by research grants? Investment in early adopters of the technology? Uh yeah).<p>>I&#x27;m not saying that having very close contact with this research group won&#x27;t be advantageous to YC companies, of course it will, but with that as a given, the ethos of this group&#x27;s findings being made open and freely available for anyone to use is well-intentioned and to be applauded, when it&#x27;s a privately funded initiative that could just as easily be justified in being somewhat or completely closed and proprietary. Is it really important if some YC companies happen to have a slight advantage from this, as an inevitable side effect, in the big picture?<p>YC&#x27;s business is growing businesses, and they&#x27;ll take any advantage they can get. If it benefits them more at all then it&#x27;s not charity or non-profit, and they shouldn&#x27;t be billing it as such.",1450241956

10742453,comment,10740029,10740685,0,0,takosalad,,,"Funny you started out mentioning WebObjects. It&#x27;s free and does everything you dreamed of. It came a long way from the ugly table based layout SJ showed off in 1995. It is the ultimate full stack MVC framework. There is still nothing comparable today.<p>The Model can be generated from db schema or vice versa. You don&#x27;t need to know SQL. The Model informs the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) how to create/read/update/delete (CRUD) your objects to/from the database. The model also validates your data for you. The field is 255 wide? Then 256 chars throws validation exceptions automatically, and so on.<p>The view is generated by reusable components on the server. Small reusable components ultimately assemble into a full page. Hundreds of components that do everything imaginable exist already.<p>With no code at all, they Controller wires them together using the Direct to Web (D2W) rule system. In fact, if all you want is an admin interface to do CRUD type operations on your database, you won&#x27;t need anything beyond the hello world D2W application. These rules allow you to make sweeping changes throughout your entire application. Want to change every component that handles text input in a form page? Create one rule:<p>100: task = &#x27;edit&#x27; and attribute.className = &#x27;java.lang.String&#x27; => componentName = &quot;MyNewEditStringComponent&quot; [Assignment]<p>Or override with other components as appropriate<p>105: task = &#x27;edit&#x27; and attribute.className = &#x27;java.lang.String&#x27; and session.user.isAdmin => componentName = &#x27;AdminEditString&#x27; [Assignment]<p>WebObjects allows you to maintain a level of state that no other web based MVC can match. You can nest your tables of data as deep as you like, paginating and sorting any of them at every level. No other web framework can do this. Period.<p>You only need to learn WebObjects to be full stack.",1450241452

The second case is where you need to map types to instances of those types, something akin to a Map<Class<T>, T> in Java syntax.

I have learned a lot about how the Matlab language works, and also a lot about how Octave is put together.<p>I don&#x27;t have much to offer to Julia on technical terms.

I think this is something that could fit quite well into Rust, actually, with its philosophy of allowing compiler plugins.<p>A simple example: Most high-level array implementations have a <i>reserve</i> method that allows you to specify the expected number of items added to the array. This allows allocating all required memory up front and hence avoids re-allocs and the associated copies.<p>In many cases, it would be trivial for a compiler to automatically determine the size of the array and add a reserve call automatically (because the entries are added in a loop with an easily-determined iteration count). Yet compilers cannot be allowed to do that, because doing so changes the visible behaviour of the program.<p>However, <i>the library in which the array is implemented</i> is free to define the semantics of the array. So that library could provide some hint to the compiler, in essence a library-provided optimization pass, which allows such reserve calls to be added automatically.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that coming up with a good DSL to describe such optimization is easy, but it may well be worthwhile in the long run.",1450239377

I&#x27;m a long time Java dev and been doing JS/TypeScript dev the last year. I&#x27;d been deciding with a newer Java/JVM stack or node.js/TS.<p>There&#x27;s a library that fixes the sync I/O issue in Java call Quasar which implements lightweight threads called Fibers. I remember seeing it a while ago and thought it was pretty interesting and it seems reasonably mature now. \nOne of the nicest things about it is you can get async IO with a sync programming model. So no callbacks and chaining of promises.<p>I&#x27;ll probably start with Java 8 but the other JVM language I quite like it Kotlin, which has a similar style to TypeScript in some ways, and is designed for Java interop. Kotlin + Quasar fibers seems like a pretty nice combo on the JVM.<p><a href=""http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/06/04/quasar-kotlin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/06/04/quasar-kotlin/</a>\n<a href=""http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/08/28/quasar-0.7.3-comsat-0.5.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/08/28/quasar-0.7.3-coms...</a>",1450238538

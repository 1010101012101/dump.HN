He had documented periods of extreme withdrawn depression and others of mild manic productivity.<p>Because of that brain disorder, perhaps because it was not attacked with the requisite treatment, he is dead.<p>If you or a loved one are ever feeling suicidal, depressed, or are acting abnormally erratic, contact an expert. It's nothing to be ashamed about. It's just a lottery of genetic expression.<p>There are others going through the same thing. There are excellent treatments available, and they get better each year.

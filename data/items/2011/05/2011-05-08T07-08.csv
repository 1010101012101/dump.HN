It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation. A number of other consequences of this result are also discussed.""<p>Also a very cool short story about this idea: <a href=""http://qntm.org/responsibility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qntm.org/responsibility</a>",1304841516

He's simply saying that there are times when the guy on the bottom of the ladder has his hands tied and can say there is nothing he could have done(breaking and entering is not a viable option for a janitor). At some point someone has to take responsibility, Jobs says that starts at the VP level.<p>I also think people get a little carried away with this due to Jobs' persona. I don't think he means it in a, ""you must get X done at all costs"". I think he's simply saying, ""This is your responsibility. You're accountable.

People buy iPads and MacBook Airs to play with. People generally buy MacBook Pros, iMacs, and MacPros for work(I did.) The fact is that ARM chips are not cut out to handle the demands of professional users and won't be for the foreseeable future. Especially now that Intel has announced tri-gate. Finally, why would Apple switch when they are placing a major bet on Thunderbolt? It seems unlikely or more accurately unwise for them to switch to AMD without a tremendously compelling reason.

Everything's just ""fast enough"" for most people.<p>Performance increases, if any, are more likely to be attributed to Windows reinstallations or the fresh setup in a new computer rather than the CPU power. Installing more memory and better hard drives have more to do with the snappiness of a personal computer than the CPU.<p>In fact, heck, I'm a programmer and the last time I think I cared about the processor speed was in the turn of the 2000's. I do notice CPU performance when compiling big codebases but compared to hours of turnaround time in the 90's any messages from the compilation units have generally just been swooshing by at an unprecedented pace during the last decade.<p>I would notice an ARM CPU on my main development laptop but I could probably live with that easily, especially given the better battery life and decreased heat production of an ARM chip.<p>Anyone else from office workers to my parents probably would never guess if it's ARM or x86, even if the former was 1GHz and the latter was 3GHz.",1304839248

She's feeling terribly overworked and unproductive mostly because of some boneheaded organizational practices.  I don't know the full story, but it sounds like she has pretty much accepted that management is brain-dead.<p>At Google, there's a culture that if something is broken, <i>call it out</i> so that it can be fixed.  At best, you will save thousands of employees hundreds of hours.  At worst, you'll learn <i>why</i> it's broken.  Many problems are inherent in running a large company, and there is no easy fix for them.  But many others have simple solutions that make everyone's lives better.<p>The way I see it (and this is completely my personal opinion here, <i>not</i> speaking for Google), he and other Xooglers who've written posts like this are being Googley.  You don't work for seven years at a company without absorbing some of the culture, and that culture doesn't simply leave when you hand in your badge.  Posts like this are not all that different from something you would see on internal Buzz or mailing lists, and I think the spirit of them is not to ""bash"" Google, but to call out things that Google could improve upon even after the Xoogler has left.",1304839179

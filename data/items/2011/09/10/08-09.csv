2981204,comment,2979405,2979935,6,0,HSO,,,"Although my instincts are the same (i.e. inequality per se should not be a problem, logically), both introspection and some academic studies* suggest inequality actually is a problem. While the incremental benefits of more _absolute_ wealth seem to vanish in the limit, the psychological cost of _relative_ poverty seems to be constant. In his excellent book ""Fault Lines"", for example, Raghuram Rajan attributes a lot of the pressure on US politicians to funnel credit to ever wider segments of society to growing inequality in the US.<p>The problem is compounded by growing inequality of opportunity or decreasing social mobility (lower now than in many parts of supposedly ""socialist"" Europe, even!). Indeed, from my perspective -- as a European of East-Asian stock and traveling between the two regions -- the US looks more and more like a plutocracy, not unlike post-communist Russia, and not like a liberal democracy. The start-up system acts like a pressure valve in that system, but that just means there is pressure to begin with.<p>Which indicates another problem with high inequality: it seems to be self-reinforcing (ossification is the keyword here). You can see this on so many levels, starting with the fact that higher education in the US costs real money.<p>_____________________<p>* which I'm too lazy to locate and properly cite here and now",1315645101
2981203,comment,2980267,2980656,7,0,cousin_it,,,"As a consumer of programming languages, I'd like the evolution of languages in the mainstream to be less incremental and more punctuated.<p>If you make a new language that's exactly like the old language but has a slightly tweaked syntax for one or two little things (e.g. changing the capitalization of the name of the string class), you're forcing lots of programmers everywhere to rewrite their code in the new flavor. You're forcing companies everywhere to spend more resources on hiring, retooling, etc. And you actively contribute to bitrot by weakening the incentives to keep old code running as-is on newer runtimes, because ""no-one writes such code nowadays anyway"". It's basically a lot of waste that could be avoided.<p>The jump from C++ to Java was big enough: it introduced garbage collection, proper modules, proper strings and other nice things into the mainstream. The jump from Java to Python, if it happens, might be marginally big enough to merit rewrites (we gain many nice small-scale constructs like dicts, generators and list comprehensions, but lose the IDE tooling and guaranteed-correct refactorings enabled by static types). The jump from JavaScript to Dash doesn't seem big enough to justify all the busywork. Please come back in five years with more shiny things.<p>...A man can dream, can't he. Obviously the big guys will keep introducing new languages where a new library or a new runtime could've done the job. They have incentives to do so. But it's not so pleasant to the rest of us.<p>You'll note that I have avoided using the word ""innovation"" so far. That is because genuine language innovation generally happens outside of the mainstream and takes decades to percolate. For example, the idea of list comprehensions is older than I am (NPL '77). For that matter, so is the idea of lazy pure functional programming (SASL '76), and the idea of parameterized types (ML '76), and any number of other ideas that people mislabel as ""innovative"" to justify creating new languages today. Adding 30-year old features into curly brace languages, bit by little bit, and forcing us to rewrite all our code at every step doesn't sound to me like the noble practice of innovation. It's more like a big coordination trainwreck.",1315645079

Depending on where the delivery is coming and going to, users who are in walking distance of the pick-up point will be able to see the request on our app. If the delivery is en-route to where ever they are going initially they can choose to accept it.

As this is obviously never going to happen, I say the copyright holders have failed to hold up their end of the bargain, and we as a society has no longer any obligation to protect their works.<p>The claim made is that copyright must be extended to properly encourage the creation of new works of art. Beatles' made their entire discography under copyright laws which would put their works in the public domain by now. Seemingly the shorter copyright didn't stop them from recording music back then. And how has extending copyright encouraged them to make more music? Right. It haven't.<p>With the public domain effectively a thing of the past, we should do away with copyright as well.",1315642590

You're trying to produce something that will be parsed as a string literal. For the most part, non-alpha-numeric characters should just be escaped. If all non-[:alphanum:] characters were escaped regardless of need, I can't think of anything that would accidentally parse as anything dynamic in any of the shells out there.<p>Also, the most common case would be system(sprintf(...)). This should just pass the command onto the shell in compatibility mode, meaning most of the extra sugar should be disabled. Even all of zsh's string parsing sugar needs to be turned on (disabled by default).<p>Ignoring all of that, the most common thing that you want properly escaped would be:<p>- Semi-colon to prevent injection.<p>- Spaces to make sure that the string is parsed as a single arg.<p>- Quotes and double-quotes because you want them to be part of the argument text and not part of the shell's syntax.<p>Even that short list of requirements would be useful.",1315642155

Now if productivity has increased in the three years that consumption had this ""U"" shape, it means the same amount of consumption goods and services can now be produced using less labour. This means that even though GDP may have returned to its previous peak level, this level of GDP is now accompanied by higher unemployment - unless new jobs have been created by something else.<p>A typical candidate for such job creation would be investment. However, given that consumption has only barely increased over the previous peak, there is currently little need for companies to make investments to satisfy consumption demand.<p>So I admit to not looking up the latest numbers before making my post, then I would have rephrased my statement. What's clear is that consumption hasn't returned to the previous trend (and probably won't), and that's a problem for the recovery (especially compared to the recovery from the 2000 recession, for example, where consumption did not deviate from the trend as the graph you linked to shows).",1315641850

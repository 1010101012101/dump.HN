Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think it would be very surprising to most people (just as this list probably isn&#x27;t surprising to most math majors, since we&#x27;ve all made at least one of these &quot;stupid mistakes&quot; before, even when we knew better, especially in the early years. The difference -- and this is reiterated several times -- is that good/smart students notice their error and debug their math/program, instead of just going with it or fudging their result).<p>Here are a few:<p>* Not actually thinking of a solution to the problem before starting to write a program; not soliciting requirements.<p>* ALL of the mistakes covered by this article. Struggling CS majors are often (not always) really, really horrible at math, and this -- more than anything else -- really holds them back from writing correct programs.<p>* Off-by-one and the functional equivalents<p>* Infinite loops in exception handling<p>* not enough input validation; too much input validation<p>* Reinventing bad versions of existing algorithms (Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is a good example) and in general not enough research before implementation.<p>* The other side of that coin is taking stack overflow upvoted answers as gospel (basically our equivalent of trusting the calculator)<p>* Fundamental incomprehension of boolean algebra, which gives rise to all sorts of errors:<p><i></i> incorrect paren placement<p><i></i> Obscenely complicated conditions and/or absurd if conditions because they don&#x27;t understand boolean algebra (e.g. I&#x27;ve seen conditions that eventually simplify to a || !a)<p><i></i> Complicated programs and grandois bug-hunting because they couldn&#x27;t figure how a simple boolean expression (there was a post on HN a while back about Javascript == vs === where the developer basically wasted a day going down a rabbit hole he attributed to == vs === but was actually completely avoidable if he had taken an undergraduate discrete math course that hammered home boolean algebra.)<p>* This page contains a very useful implementation details section which describes some common errors implementing quicksort: <a href=""http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/23quicksort/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/23quicksort/</a><p>* As a general rule, any program written by a student containing concurrency is always wrong, unless concurrency was explicitly taught (many schools just have a short unit in a course or two, instead of integrating the topic throughout the curriculum).",1408089341

Sometimes it takes someone pointing something out to me, to allow me to course correct and I thank you.<p>I guess I really connected with what you said and it was well written. You said it in a way that would take me quite some time to get across, and described it much better than I could. That blended pretty well with my own experiences. I could procrastinate about procrastinating myself, it&#x27;s not a good place and a frustrating feeling. I tried to read as many books and read about as many other people as possible to try better my understanding of why I do it so much, so often, despite me knowing a lot of data about it. I believe what Petsfold is trying to do is to personify procrastination to a recongizable point, like a character, so you can consciously choose to not let that character win. That&#x27;s my main takeaway from the book. It&#x27;s certainly helped me. I still procrastinate, but I feel like I know a little more. Almost like &quot;what is it I&#x27;m resisting about x that&#x27;s making me procrastinate so much&quot;. This can sometimes, not always, help me identify and act on variables that might be affecting me at that moment in time. Best of luck, and thank you again.",1408089341

Redundancy is built into the language for a reason - language communication is extremely noisy and if there&#x27;s two-bit-error distance between &quot;I love you&quot; and &quot;I killed and ate your dog&quot; then the usage of this language by humans would not be comfortable.<p>Moreover, people communicating are imperfect. So if you have a language which is very precise and concise, you would have to spend a lot of effort to find a word or set of words which exactly expresses your meaning (in programming, we call it design when we do it upfront, and debugging when we do it post factum) and communication would be a very complex exercise. However, if you have a lot of words which mean roughly the same, you can be sure the meaning is passed through even if the words are not chosen super-carefully.",1408089080

Exactly <i>how</i> you go on about this varies <i>wildly</i> depending on what tools you have at your disposal, but the unifying thing about all of them is that you&#x27;re writing code which acts on other code, for some (rather fuzzy) definitions of &quot;code&quot; and &quot;acting on&quot;.<p>One nice example of modifying code on the fly I just remembered is goto decorator in Python: <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576944-the-goto-decorator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576944-the-goto-decorato...</a> As for code generation, if I recall correctly, Salt (<a href=""http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/</a>) uses YAML and Jinja2 to generate shell scripts.

What exactly does it mean to &quot;know math&quot;?<p>Here&#x27;s an alternative explanation: math students do lots of computations, and sometimes make mistakes which they would be able to identify immediately if someone told them &quot;you made a mistake on this line&quot;.<p>Kind of like how all programmers occasionally drop a paren or a semicolon.

This is true especially when there&#x27;s no guarantee that the article/post/whatever-content being accessed is gonna be of super-high quality. These things have been well captured through theories like Privacy Calculus [0] which basically posit that privacy concerns can often be trumped by the benefits of sharing resulting in a net positive utility.<p>[0] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=privacy+calculus&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C33&as_sdtp="" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=privacy+calculus&b...</a>",1408087149

Two of the three co-founders (including me) are recent University grads. For the past few months we have been working full-time, living on our savings from the grad-school funding and the prize money from a local startup competition that we won. However, now we are  running out of our funds and would probably dry-out before we have a product ready to launch/show-off. \nWe are open to the idea of external funding of any sort. We have talked to a bunch of investors and are currently in talks with a company that is interested in acqui-hiring us(nothing&#x27;s finalized and we are still debating if it would be a good thing or not to take the deal, in case we get one). We have received good response and validation from most of the investors we talked to (which is motivating), but, not surprisingly, they all at least want to see a working product before they can think about funding us. \nIt will take us ~3 more months before we have a product that we can show-off. To keep us going until we have some funding/paying customers, we are planning to take up part-time freelancing projects to sustain our product development. We understand that this could be very consuming and there is a risk of losing focus, but we don&#x27;t see another way that would keep our startup from dying out. I would really appreciate if you can share your advice, opinions and suggestions on this. \nNote: We are also working on launching a kickstarter campaign.",1408087113

Being able (or expected) to enjoy your work is a relatively new thing in human society.<p>I don't know how true this is, one of Marx's key criticism of Capitalism was the idea that, under capitalism, workers were alienated from their work, because they were unable to find true autonomy and determinism in what they did, nor reap the true value of what they produced. So I don't think the concept that work should also be fulfilling is entirely new, if Marx was lamenting its demise over 100 years ago.",1286323193

Yeah, those ruffle my feathers, and I think eliminating those things and striving for their elimination is an element of good governance.<p>> This is a fine example of a place that has thrown away the heterogeneity of life, the celebration of differences and quirks, in exchange for strictly enforced harmony.<p>That's nonsense.

It's safe, clean, and orderly because it's incredibly conservative and repressive - culturally and politically. I mean come on, can you seriously buy that only a single person stepped forth to run for the highest office of the land? Or that a single party has 97.6% representation in parliament?<p>IMHO this is too high of a price to pay. This is a fine example of a place that has thrown away the heterogeneity of life, the celebration of differences and quirks, in exchange for strictly enforced harmony. No thanks - some things are worth the dirt and grime, the chaos of disagreement and protest.<p>You mentioned Hong Kong in another post - I'd much rather explore Hong Kong's system than Singapore's. It's dirtier, grimier, but much more human and IMHO real. It's free market almost to a fault, and is IMHO a pretty damn good example of libertarianism as a success rather than Singapore's story of centralized one-party rule.<p>Your idea of ""well governed"" seems to have an awful lot to do with lacking in things that ruffle feathers and make people uncomfortable. IMHO the mark of an enlightened society and people is its ability to integrate individualism and inevitable disagreements into the core of how its society functions - rather than seek to squash all semblance of it in exchange for artificial harmony.<p>[edit] I also find it somewhat distasteful that we harp on China for its human rights abuses, its repressive single-party rule, and its incredibly socially conservative policies... yet we give Singapore a free pass.

Suffice it to say, you all can do the math.<p>But that's not why I comment. I was actually thinking of a startup idea re: driving and accidents. Specifically, a site attached to Google Maps, etc., where people can register comments about where and how they got involved in an accident. If there were a way to feed in police report data, that would be awesome too.<p>But like the San Mateo bridge. I can see it from my desk. And I can see when it gets slow, and sometimes I'll check sigalert and note that there's been an accident (it seems to me usually at the top of the bridge where it's kind of windy and the furthest left lane has like no shoulder). Or otherwise I've gotten to know where accidents occur on my commute.<p>So my point is that all the information should be readily available so that people can figure out what are the high risk locations of their commute or trip.

If encryption becomes widespread, this just isn't practical.  It's easy to prove that you sell drugs; someone goes up to you and buys them.

This is why I am learning how to code; so I don't have to go through all the trouble to get a technical cofounder every time I come up with an idea I really like. This way I can build a prototype and be a lot more credible when I approach people to work with me.",1286319704

After these 5 minutes, the address is still available if it life was extended, but any new resubmission get another address.<p>In this way the shortcut is active between 5 and 10 minutes, and at any time there are at most two shortcuts for each original URL (for each expiration interval).",1286319672

Something more than a 20 questions test and 10 minutes in the car with a tester would be a good start. Maybe some sort of forced driving school?<p>Then, when everyone's better educated, we can raise the speed limits to reasonable levels and still have less accidents.",1286319633

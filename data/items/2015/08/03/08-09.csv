I do this primarily for exactly the two reasons you mentioned above.<p>FWIW, I run my own mail server and all e-mail accounts and aliases are stored in SQL.

I do this to avoid any &quot;coincidences&quot; where a spammer tries to send mail to a random address that actually exists as one of my aliases. That is, a spammer may try to send to &quot;hn@example.com&quot; which very well could exist.

I didn&#x27;t have my laptop handy (only my iPad and iPhone) so instead I used the &quot;checkout as a guest&quot; option and employed the &quot;+&quot; separator trick (i.e., I used &quot;me+papajohns@&quot; as my e-mail address).  I try to avoid this whenever possible and create an actual alias as some sites a) don&#x27;t allow &quot;+&quot; as a valid character or b) are aware of this &quot;trick&quot; and simply strip off the suffix, thus ending up with my real e-mail address. (For the curious, the confirmation e-mail was sent via ExactTarget and they didn&#x27;t strip off &quot;+papajohns&quot;.)<p>I just started doing this several months ago but it helped me discover that either the dealership I bought my newest car from or Reynolds and Reynolds (who provide an application the dealership uses) shared my e-mail address with Edmunds.com, who later started spamming me. Because I do this, however, that situation was easy to take care of (delete alias and blacklist the sending mail servers).",1438588941

The primary practical benefit of a common, strictly enforced set of rules is that it solves a great many of coordination problems (think prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, tragedy of the commons). The problem isn&#x27;t usually with a single greedy individual who wants to profit off the group; it&#x27;s with the (apparently) natural human tendency to optimize for one&#x27;s own benefit first. It&#x27;s fine when one person does it, but when everyone does it, everyone loses. So a set of <i>enforced</i> common rules is a thing that keeps the group both from getting overrun by freeloaders and by self-destructing because of the usual human stupidity.",1438588898

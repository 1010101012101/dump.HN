There is really only so much you can do with HDMI + IR blaster (or for the lucky few with very new TVs and/or set-top boxes) HDMI with CEC.<p>There are tons of edge cases you run into when you don't have full control of the tuning stack.  As one example (I can think of dozens easily):<p>Family has a single-tuner old school Scientific Atlanta DVR (still very popular with cable operators despite being horribly obsolete).  They set it up to record a show, it is currently recording said show, person interacting with the Xbox One does something to change the channel to one different than the one being recorded on... oops!  There is no way for the Xbox One to know this is a potentially destructive operation for the DVR.   At worst the DVR changes the channel and loses half your show, at best the DVR is smart enough to prompt you about this and stop the channel change, but how does the Xbox One know this occurred?  There are some high-end DVRs with APIs that exist in an attempt to deal with situations like this but they are very few, very far between and there are no standards for them.<p>Corner cases like this present themselves all the time with these HDMI-in/HDMI-out devices like Google TV and they are inherent problems with the current state of set-top box technology.  No matter how many resources Microsoft throws at this, the end result will still be kind of lame a lot of the time and a far cry from the seamless experience you see in the on-stage demos.",1369259948

I too was lured into more education with high prospects but the truth is that it's really difficult to get in on the awesomeness. If you want to make a statement about long-term benefits you better talk about the average situation. Some PhD's do provide quite a bit more money on average, but a lot of PhD's (math, for example) provide only a marginal benefit over a Master's degree. I don't have the data in front of me but when I checked the situation for math, the difference in the mean was about 2-3 thousand dollars per year. If you take into account the financial opportunity costs of doing a PhD (things like low wages, tuition, loans), it will take you about 40-50 years AFTER finishing your degree to be on par, on average.",1369259933

Gun-based suicides are a major cause of death using guns (I think more than third-party shootings); high per-capita rates in places like Wyoming where people are remote.  Mental health services in those markets would be great.<p>2) Drug war issues; using technology to help reduce violence in the drug war (which is the main driver of third-party violence).  Could also use technology to reduce profits or demand for drugs, too.<p>3) Technology applied to domestic violence; the smallest of the three major forms of gun violence, but still a major issue.

Business people tend to mistrust highly educated people with no at least as impressive industry credentials. The meme of the crazy scientist with the head on the moon an no concern to real concerns runs deep and wide. Once you have both the schooling and the provable hands on experience it starts to pay off, but getting there is not trivial. Also, to make it pay it off you must go into consulting, since no employer will think they can afford you full time past some point. And to make it as consultant you need to pick an specialty that provides hard qualitatively measurable value.<p>2. Scratch that immense job security in the private university. As a matter of fact, they tend to hire a lot of adjunct professors and post-doc lecturers in order to avoid giving the sinecure for full professors. Public universities and research centers are still ok, but you will have a hard time in any education center whose bottom line depends on undergrad tuition.<p>3. Don't count on the flexibility thing either. University may be happy to hire part time lecturers with lots of industry experience, but not the other way around. I had a very hard time crawling out of this particular hole and have know others that never were able to make it back after a ""short stint as a teacher"".<p>4.

It is harder to question the authority of a (technical) PhD. This is much more pronounced in 3rd world economies. Also Germany. Basically anywhere besides the non-super-meritocratic US. This is a huge benefit: my opinions are more likely to be listened to, my consulting fees are likely to be higher and be more credible, career breaks (maternity) will not set me back by much, because a PhD proves technical mastery of an area as well as tenacity, responsibility, and independence - all of which non-PhDs will continously try to prove to new coworkers and new management.<p>- Universities are forever open, but not so with Masters. That gives immense job security as a private university lecturer for the rest of your life, in any country (flexibility to travel and find a job even in countries you don't speak the language of). Private universities in rich countries pay a lot to be able to say they have a, say, MIT-PhD on their faculty. I knew a person who had a data-entry job and saw the faculty salaries in Saudi Arabia. The profs were making 396$k/year, housing and living costs fully compensated by the university.<p>- Flexibility to find jobs forever (especially because of the university thing). Normally I imagine it would be harder to be a salaried employee after 65 years of age. Nobody will hire you because it is so weird to have an employee your dad's age. Ageism is real. But because you can always lecture, you are pretty much unretirable.<p>The 4-5 year salary cut is nothing compared to a lifetime of these benefits and zero anxiety about job prospects after 50.

Suffice to say that many people saw this as counter productive, and more recent research has shown that in many ways it has been exactly that; or rather, misguided interpretations of fostering self-esteem have led to the creation of over coddled babies masquerading as young adults.<p>Unfortunately, your generation is saddled with this stereotype whether you like it or not.

You can view the cache contents as being <i>part</i> of the state (rather than the memory); you can similarly view instructions as being part of sequences, so that a single instruction can mean different things depending on the state from which it is fetched.  Other modern features can be similarly approached (with the exception of CPUs whose behavior depends on environmental factors like temperature, but that is an edge case).<p>Really, if you doubt that the RASP model is appropriate for modern architectures, you can test it (a typical exercise in an algorithms course) -- see if, as the input size grows, the timing follows the asymptotic analysis.  That is basically what the article you linked to does, and the results are not all that surprising -- where things are linear time in theory, they are linear time in practice; where they are quadratic time in theory, they are quadratic time in practice.

There were a lot of events but you could only choose to be in 2 of them.<p>Apparently my class decimated the competition.  Whoops.

This is especially true for the people who would be considering a PhD in the first place.<p>Whether or not someone pursues a PhD likely comes down to the personal value they believe they will get from the process, not the projected economic benefit.<p>On some level, it makes sense that the majority of PhD-holders do not have a starting-gate income advantage over BS holders. In recent years, a BS has become a gateway to the workforce.<p>I think this is partly because of the ease of hiring it presents to employers. If someone is a college graduate, that serves as a soft guarantee of ability, responsiblity, and education.<p>PhD work is by nature ill-suited to the workforce. Research positions are rare, and finding an open opportunity that speaks perfectly to a unique education will be difficult.

Assuming they're well paid, resorting to carting off a fridge full of soda every week is a disturbing way to behave and I'd want to understand their motivation and identify if they behaved this way in other areas of their work-life. They likely thought (1) they'd not get caught or(/and) (2) the value of the theft was so low that they'd likely not get in trouble. I'd be concerned most about the ""I won't get caught"" people at any company that a large part of their profits are from selling closed-source software. Sharing loads of source code might also be seen as something they'd think they wouldn't get caught doing. I'd still be concerned about anyone with the moral flexibility to brazenly steal large quantities of even inexpensive items and expect, if caught, to get away with it. At a minimum, that's not the kind of culture you want to spreading and it probably speaks to their intelligence slightly.<p>Generally, people hate ""passive-aggressive notes"". At a previous someone placed a note on the sink asking everyone to clean up the microwave after using it. Someone had heated up pasta and left the tomato sauce all over the interior. I took the note down and kindly asked the person responsible to be more careful in the future. It was equally effective, but without pointing the finger at every person on the floor. In the case of the soda, skip any note and let the word spread through informal lateral communication (""gossip"" channels are rarely used effectively by management).",1369256567

My point was that the amount of savings they would realize ($280,000 per year) was so marginal when the number of affected employees were taken into account.<p>If I came up to you and said ""I can give you a piece of software that will save you $1.17 per month, but I will have to sell it to you for $40"", would that be a good deal?<p>Why is it that when you multiply those numbers by 20,000 that it all of a sudden becomes a good deal?  Especially when you can't be 100% certain that your cost projections are perfectly accurate, being a bit too optimistic can wipe out any hope of any savings.<p>My point was just that because the numbers are big they look really important.  But when you look at them spread across the workforce it looks different.  Saving $280,000/year after 3 years is just fine.  Saving $14/year after 3 years is fine too.  One looks far more important than the other.<p>If the news story said that it would save them $1.17 per user per month after 34 months, would it have the same impact?<p>If a company says they spend 2 million dollars a year on free soda for staff, that sounds excessive.  If they spend 2 million dollars per year on soda but they say that they spend 45 cents per day on average on soda per employee, does that have the same impact?<p>In the former, you don't have any point of reference 2 million dollars is a lot of money.  In the latter you immediately consider things like how much the employee's wage is, how much electricity they use, how much water they use washing their hands after using the toilet.   If you have someone using a Xerox copier that charges a few cents per copied page, now their copier usage is majorly competing with the cost of soda.<p>In the grand scheme of things though, a couple of dollars per day per employee, for professionals, can be pretty much ignored. But if you think of it instead of $1,000,000 per year, it's harder to ignore, even though it's the same thing.",1369256462

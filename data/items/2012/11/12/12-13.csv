We didn't have many, but it was helpful to talk about the few things we did disagree on. I wonder if they were able to do something similar before their marriage; maybe it would have helped.</i><p>We didn't meet on a dating website, but my current partner and I have done pretty much this. We sat down, and talked, and had a very frank, logical discussion of the things we disagree on, to try and weed out any red-flag issues before they became issues. It transpired that politically, we're quite different - but we both think it's pretty boring to be with someone who feels the same as you on every issue, all the time. I think it was good to do that - to talk thoroughly through things in a calm way, before they turn up in a completely unrelated fight.",1352725193

We do now though, but we had to do that ourselves.\nTo get systemd right for Mageia one person got involved with systemd and has sent various improvements upstream. Fixing bugs, etc, because nothing is perfect.<p>In any case, my point is that almost everyone at GNOME uses all kinds of different Linux distributions, so everyone is aware of that.<p>That GNOME is not packaged on *BSD: Why should that be troublesome if there is no involvement from them? In any case, we do get involvement from OpenBSD, just very little in comparison.<p>For GNOME, various distributions send patches because a released tarball does not work in their environment. This is often done in the two days between tarball creation deadline and the actual GNOME release. This does not happen too often btw, but this is not limited to any specific distribution.<p>What I am trying to say is: to make something work you have to work together. If you expect something perfect, I find it logical it turns out as a disappointment.",1352725111

4772616,comment,4772133,4772249,4,0,pmr_,,,"The maturity of systemd is at the root of the problem here. I switched (even for ArchLinux standards) relatively early and since then I could see how things changed continuously. There are two factors here: I appreciate active development of software and I would like things to stay compatible with previous releases at a minor cost to ""progress"". It is hard to get both in such a complex design space. Most of the problems are hard to predict and only come up as soon as there is active use of the system and if you never go public, there will never be active use.<p>Overall, jumping on the systemd bandwagon was done prematurely (at least by ArchLinux) and I think the large software packages should just give it another few months before migrating. systemd solves a lot of problems now and developers want problems to go as away before they become a feature or to pervasive to the codebase, but a little restraint might to a lot of good here.<p>There has to come a point where systemd announces feature completeness and stable interfaces so everybody can use it as a standard and then everybody can go for broad use and acceptance. I would hope that this gives the smaller players a chance to catch-up and much needed safety when investing resources into their own implementations.",1352724829

Aside from The Greater Good they've got themselves a nice little vendor lock in, and unlike Apple who was making money hand over fist with the iPod and using the iTunes store to help get consumers to start building digital libraries, Amazon isn't making staggering amounts of money on the Kindle and they <i>really</i> need people to stick on the platform.<p>Seems like a few publishers have seen sense regarding DRM (Tor and Angry Robot are the first two who spring to mind), so maybe they'll eventually wise up and start dropping the DRM requirement.",1352724690

It would be a massive undertaking, and, unlike many other aspects of OS development, would require very serious long-term commitments. That's what makes this new screw-you attitude in Linux upstream so frustrating for the BSDs; it's taking groups of developers that are already stretched really thin, and it's placing even greater demands on them, and for pretty silly reasons in some cases. You really can't blame the BSD developers for feeling sabotaged.<p>So I think it's more likely that another desktop environment project that still has sane developers, like xfce, will end up getting some more activity while being easier to install on the BSDs (and consequently better supported there).<p>> <i>It doesn't exactly help that there are four major BSDs</i><p>Yeah, the fallout between NetBSD and Theo was unfortunate.

Good software either gets championed by someone, or it fades forever into obscurity. (I wrote a really amazing hack years ago ... in COBOL. Maybe you've heard of me?)<p>Likewise, the people that are contributing to BSD right now are doing so because they believe in what they are working on. Although some of them are true cross-platform developers, many others would never make the switch. It would be agony trying to work in Linux if you're, say, Theo de Raadt. Seriously, I wonder if that might be his own personal version of hell.<p>I use a lot of both -- Debian, an Arch-like thing, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and have for years. The only reason that I know that iptables has serious shortcomings is because I've used pf. If I had never used the BSDs, I would have no idea what I was missing out on. If I had twenty more hours in a day, I might even be tempted to make iptables more pf-like.<p>pf is kind of my go-to for BSD cheerleading, but it shines in other core areas too. For instance, Linux is really only just now getting stuff that looks like a distributed or cluster file system; but BSD has had this for quite a while already. Heck, one of the best options for a while in this area was HAMMER, developed by <i>one guy</i> for his personal BSD. And if you wanted something a little bit more mainstream, FreeBSD has supported ZFS for a long time -- Linux is still catching up there. Or, there was the new malloc that OpenBSD developed a few years ago, that ended up revealing old memory-related bugs in all kinds of software (e.g. <a href=""http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20080708155228&mode=flat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=2008070815522...</a>).<p>There's simply no way that all those people would be doing the same kind of work in the sort of environment that Linux is fostering right now.",1352723439

Make or take a desktop environment that those clamoring for GNOME 2 or KDE 3 love, integrate it very well with your base system, and make a very predictable ABI, ABI, and development schedule.

This Apple //c came with a single software package that included two disks and a book.  It looked pretty lame at first.<p>The first disk contains a typical BASIC programming tutorial.<p>The second disk contained 15-or-so of games written in BASIC.  Some graphics games, some text games.<p>The book contained a high-level design document for each of the games on the second disk, along with a low-level, line-by-line explanation of each line of code.  It's amazing.<p>I would have killed for something like that as a kid.",1289897596

But the same thing is true with math and science education. If you want to learn trig or calculus, it's set at such a pace in schools that it guarantees that only the absolutely best students will learn it.</i><p>Reminded me of the essay <i>""Everyone Should Get an A""</i>:

Haskell is the way their thinking comes out. So if you're in that 3% you probably know and possibly even use Haskell already because you have that sort of train of thought. If you're in the remaining 97%, you could only do much less or barely nothing at all until you had had a long series of ""aha!""s, not often even related to Haskell itself.<p>Instead of language training, effectively a mindset-changing smartness training is what would have to come first.",1289894903

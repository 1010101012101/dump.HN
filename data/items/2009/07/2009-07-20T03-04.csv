A better metric is a journey of constant distance,
I've been making long journeys(4-6 or 8-10hrs) since early childhood.
They definitely feel considerably shorter now.

Think of it as a big de-orbit burn. Of course you'd want it to deposit you into Earth-orbit (perhaps after some aerobraking), hence the need for proper timing, but on the whole much easier than trying to enter the higher orbit of Mars. Two rocket scientists I asked confirm this, but asked me not to quote them on it, so I'm paraphrasing :). Also, Mars' lower gravity makes achieving escape velocity substantially easier than on Earth.<p>Of course, it's still a not insubstantial amount of fuel, but it's not quite as bad as duplicating the trip up to get back.<p>Personally, though, if we shipped up enough stuff to survive, I'd be cool with a one-way trip.",1248061921

713907,comment,713585,713649,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>We went to the moon to beat the Soviets.</i><p>That's half the truth. The rest of the truth is: We went to the Moon out of <i>sheer terror</i>.<p>In fact, the Moon trip itself was a side effect. The space race took the form of a race to the moon because ""the race to the Moon"" was a much more joyful marketing slogan than ""the race to design and build the next generation of ICBMs that will enable cities and towns like yours to be destroyed with even greater precision.""<p>Remember that the Moon race was conceived in the early 1960s. ICBMs were a brand new technology. Everybody knew that we had to build more of them, keep improving them, stay ahead in them -- they'd seen the H-bomb tests. People who had lived through the 1940s -- Stalingrad, Auschwitz, Nanking, Bataan, Dresden, Nagasaki -- naturally found it difficult to have faith in human decency and restraint; they all thought World War III was inevitable, and probably imminent. This was several years before the Cuban missile crisis and a decade before the ABM treaty.<p>But it was hard to stay cheerful when talking about the world's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenals, so the space race was portrayed as a game to get astronauts and/or cosmonauts to the moon, and everyone had a lot of fun playing along. Enormous quantities of money were poured into rocket research, the military on both sides of the Cold War got their high-tech missiles and spy satellites and electronics, and in the end we got to watch some truly amazing pictures of people walking on the moon and feel proud. Smiles all around. A big win for everyone.<p>But the Moon itself was a secondary goal. A Macguffin. The Soviets didn't even bother to go, and their effort seems to me to have been rather halfhearted. By 1969 they had long since achieved the important goal anyway: Better rockets. The USA followed through but quickly got bored with the actual ""moon"" part. The <i>Apollo 13</i> movie talked all about that: Mere months after the first moon missions, the remaining ones attracted scant public interest.<p>So I find the space race fascinating, and I understand the nostalgia for it, and I'm glad some good came out of the cold war, but I don't want to live through anything like it if I don't have to.",1248061859

When in fact it's just the opposite.  It's setting the stage for it's eventual return under a new name if they should ever feel the need to bring it back.<p>Because if they do bring it back part of the push will be ""we realize DRM was bad but this new thing fixes the problems.""  In order to make that statement they need to disown DRM now.",1248059620

713844,comment,713529,713529,0,0,iigs,,,"It annoys me when router vendors (Cisco, looking at you) advertise their throughput as theoretical maximum bi-directional. Almost no real network design can take advantage of that speed. If this router only has 4x10g port (the two left cards), for all intents and purposes it's a 40-50gbit router. That's probably a great deal in the $50-100k range, though, so there's still a place for it.<p>I feel like I'm telling Larry Wall what is up with Perl or something, but this guy is making route caching sound like something new, when it has been in crappy $4000 workgroup-class layer three switches now for almost a decade. This kind of deflates his ""I should know"" appeals to authority.<p>The buffer-alternative algorithm isn't well explained but sounds kind of novel and useful. It would be particularly so if it allows the network operator to manage flows on a per subscriber basis.<p>One other concern: if this router is cutting power/weight corners by decreasing its ability to calculate new routes (""flows""), it's possible that an ISP would be exposing themselves to a DoS of their network by intruders sending a lot of unique flow requests to the router. An obvious example of this would be several concurrent NMAPs of a large range of IPs.<p>If it can keep up with the large workloads they claim with only 300w and 3U (or so) of space, it's pretty compelling, all of these issues aside. I'm excited to see it in the real world.",1248058987

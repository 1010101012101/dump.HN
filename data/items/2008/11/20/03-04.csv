370292,comment,370258,370258,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Okay, I've probably spent 150 hours reading about branding and naming... two corporate structures, three websites, and a half-dozen products now. Here's where to start:<p><a href=""http://ezinearticles.com/?Monster-Amazon-Crocs---Why-Creative-Brand-Names-Work-Best&id=425088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ezinearticles.com/?Monster-Amazon-Crocs---Why-Creativ...</a><p><a href=""http://ezinearticles.com/?Why-Weird-Words-Make-Great-Brand-Names&id=177974"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ezinearticles.com/?Why-Weird-Words-Make-Great-Brand-N...</a><p><a href=""http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Power-of-Storytelling-to-Build-a-Better-Brand&id=170871"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Power-of-Storytelling-to-Build...</a><p>The author of those pieces has some really good ideas. Now, some feedback:<p>1. Do what other people aren't doing. Sounds obvious, but you're almost certain to pick something that sounds like what others are doing in your field unless you take a really bold stance. Look at 37signals: They named most of their products after camping. They compete primarily with business software with boring titles. They started marketing first and foremost to design firms. Cool.<p>2. Look at negative words. Every is ""Super Awesome Perfect Strategically Integrated Systems"" - much more interesting to be ""Apocalyptic Computers"" than ""Desktop Systems Corp."" -- Of course if you brand negative and your product sucks, people curse you even louder.<p>3. Keep a running list of words in a notepad file. Just let it get bigger and bigger to mix and match later.<p>4. Try putting the names of people/things you admire into Wikipedia, follow the links around, and read the words in the file. Start with Renaissance artists and inventors if you like. Explorers, military leaders, writers, humanitarians, reformers. There's lots of interesting words associated with them. Rome and Japan have a bunch of words that everyone's heard of but rarely thinks of.<p>If your name is creative, everyone will hate it at first. And even if it sucks, everyone internal will come to love if you start using it. Don't trust either of these reactions. Finally, ""Web 2.0 names"" will almost certainly sound really, really stupid in five years.<p>Good luck - the process takes a while, but business life really is easier and better with a cool, memorable name.",1227152600

370270,comment,369480,369577,0,0,celoyd,,,"A master model is not necessarily slower. Everything goes through the server either way, and it comes down to how much data you have to transmit and how much the sender, server, and receiver have to process it.<p>At <a href=""http://draftastic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://draftastic.com/</a> we keep a master but only broadcast changed portions -- a compromise between re-sending the whole document and handling a hail of tiny diffs. This uses automatic locking, which we thought was reasonable given that people rarely want to type directly on top of each other, but it means a much simpler implementation of undo and so on. Basically, we've made a heartbeat-based system with heartbeats so cheap that they can be fast, and we never need a merge algorithm.<p>In any case, I'll be watching the just-raw-edits approach with interest. Best of luck to Etherpad -- there's plenty of room in the market.",1227150845

I thought about putting the bar at the top but I didn't want to obstruct logos and headers by setting the iFrame as-is, while starting the main frame at the bottom of the bar would then eat up too much real estate.<p>As for your question, it's an awesome one. To this point I have not received any negative feedback from developers but I've also only pushed testing traffic through the site. It's entirely possible that I will receive negative feedback as the site grows, though I obviously hope developers see worthyy as helping more than hurting.<p>My perspective is this: I could easily start yet another blog that covers web services and each post would be just another singular perspective on each site. Try as I might to avoid it, my opinions, impressions and perspective will inevitably come through as visitors read my take on each site. My perspective will weigh heavily on whether or not readers end up clicking through. I don't want this.<p>I want the developer's work to do the talking. Developers put tremendous amounts of time and thought into building these sites. I obviously don't need to tell you that. Why should I be just another guy who covers their work on my blog, inevitably misrepresents something, misses covering key functionality, etc? I want worthyy users to see and experience each site as the developer envisioned it - without preconceived impressions from my opinion or anyone else's for that matter. I then make it as easy as possible for the user to bookmark the site and should they choose to click through and discuss the site, there is always a direct link waiting for them.<p>That said, my intentions hardly invalidate the fact that some may potentially view worthyy as stealing their content. To that I can only assure those concerned that I will, without hesitation, remove content from my site immediately should the owner of the content request that I do so.

I don't think that google has voice recognition.  At least in that respect, voice recognition will be very hard for all when based service to do.  You'd really need a desktop application such as the built in each recognition in Microsoft Windows vista to catch up to the future of the Internet -- voice dictation.  For example, this polls is written entirely in Microsoft backspace now delete that in speech recognition.",1176663189

Microsoft's software is unmaintainable, without throwing titanic amounts of money at it. This means that if Microsoft experiences declining sales on its basic products (Windows, Office), the products themselves will disappear. In a decade, Wine may be all that is left of Windows.<p>2. The price of Windows is increasing, as the price of computers is plummeting. A $2000 computer with a $100 operating system works. A $500 computer with a $200 operating system doesn't. Windows should cost no more than $20 today. Microsoft's model is clearly unsustainable.<p>3. The biggest benefit from Microsoft alternatives isn't replacing Windows, the benefit is being able to do things that were never possible with Windows. Linux bootable CD/flash is a wonderful approach for single-purpose devices, which is what most of the world wants almost all computers to be.<p>I've been programming computers for 40 years now, and this is about the third major transition I've been through. It is by far the most fun.

I have to assume they're doing it for the first two reasons, not so much the latter.  My guess is that they've already got a good solution to this, given that it's integral to their business.  Maybe they think they'll find a better solution out there, and if so it'd make sense to hire that person.",1176660205

76629,comment,76469,76625,0,0,pg,,,"From the variation between Ron Paul's prominence in hacker opinion and on reddit.  Till now (and I have literally been observing reddit since day 1), the topics on reddit have been an exaggerated version of typical hacker opinion.  E.g. though there were a lot of anti-Bush links, most people in the hacker world do dislike Bush.  But I have literally never heard anyone mention Ron Paul in conversation except when talking about how his supporters spam the aggregators.  He's like Levitra.  I only even know his name as a spam token.",1194367639

I only come to the site when I really want to vote something up, or if I want to comment (or read comments).  I'm a fairly passive user of YC, so a lot of my votes I didn't even 'click' from the site, so you'd also have to check those from the RSS feed for this to even remotely be effective.\n",1194367539

76621,comment,76461,76607,0,0,SirWart,,,"I guess my problem is that he's implying that simple systems are bad because they can be easily implemented by anyone.<p>It is very easy to write a Scheme interpreter, and a lot of people write very bad interpreters, but that doesn't imply Scheme is a bad language.  Java is a lot harder to implement, so the few implementations out there tend to be very good.<p>As for language, I agree that the C programmers left are on average better than the average Python programmer (I'm not using Java for this example because I don't actually know much about Java), but that doesn't imply that it's better to use C than Python because the average C programmer is better than the average Python programmer.  Personally, I'll use Python wherever I can even though I'm a better C programmer than Python programmer, simply because getting things done in Python is on the whole easier.",1194365980

That means that Joe User gets the admin page sent to them hidden using CSS.<p>If you want to cache individual pages for users then you can do that with a standard cache mechanism (e.g. memcached) and just expire the cache when you decide an update is necessary.<p>John.\n",1194365854

Some consider fun to go out every Saturday to hit a disco, but I don't really like them (way too noisy). On the other hand, I consider programming fun, but there's a lot of guys that think that me coding in my free time is weird.",1194365745

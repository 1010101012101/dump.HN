But it means adding yet another FB dependency (or third-party if you will) to my web page, and that means more stuff for users to download. It also clutters the UI and placing it on a page can sometimes be a mayor PITA, depending on the layout of your page, and the last thing I want is to redesign parts of my pages yet again because FB released a new button. You can always choose not to use it, but we all know how that is with search-driven traffic. Now days if you don't have FB's like button it's like putting ""Disallow: *"" in your robots.txt.

Facebook's challenge is to stay ahead of this curve such that their garden appears to be more open than it is in order to stem attrition, but there are still lots of people who aren't interested in likes or tweeting or any other form of information-disgorgement toward a private company. Couple this with possible (and possibly inevitable) privacy breaches and Facebook remains vulnerable. Think of where Google was five years ago and where they stand today, as a less-than-total (and possibly decreasing) presence.<p>There is an ebb-and-flow to these developments, and Facebook users constitute thin-clients in the continuing historical battle between centralization and nodal power.<p>EDIT: clarified 'thin-client' relationship",1303803864

I have identified few specific areas that can make use of our product, but as you mentioned engaging with them in a conversation may be the best way to find out.<p>I just read the article recommended by the other commenter (Joel's article on Segmentation) and it makes sense.<p>I think I should do the following to start with: talk to potential customers to find out what is critical; identify their price sensitivity; then group the features needed for various customer segments and identify price points.<p>I guess this will take several iterations to get a grasp, but I think I have a fair idea now as to where to start.",1303802535
2484282,comment,2483507,2483507,1,0,assiotis,,,"Problem with RAID is not just drives failing, but also the UBE (Unrecoverable Bit Error). Lets say you have a RAID5 configuration. In addition to the probability of disk failure, you need to account for the probability of some failure plus the controller's inability to repair the problem because a sector on the good disks experienced an UBE. The probability of UBE on enterprise level disks is rather low (10^-16 I think) but that quickly shoots up if you start considering 1TB and 2TB drives.<p>Problem with EBS benchmarks is that they largely depend on who else is sharing the spindles with you at the time the benchmark was run. Given the large variance in performance that is being reported, the sample size for some reliable statistics would need to be quite large",1303802534

It's not a black and white thing and it is sometimes very difficult to even tell goals and approaches apart because a particular approach to solve a larger problem can become an intermediate goal. Sometimes minor differences regarding the preferred approach become dogma. On the other hand, it's always possible to define goals broadly enough to find common ground with almost everybody but then it becomes meaningless.

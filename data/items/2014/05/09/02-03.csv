7719014,comment,7717742,7718959,2,0,brc,,,"Nice.   In terms of buying the raw materials - you should find if there is a specialty supplier in your area.  You can get a lot more interesting cuts and species from those, especially if you&#x27;re working on relatively small scale projects.  The major stores are optimized around people buying lots for bigger projects.  You might even be able to find a sawmill somewhere that is willing to sell direct.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget...they&#x27;re just trees.   You can get them milled yourself and get your own wood.  My brother in law saw an old oak tree get cut down for a new factory.  It had a nice, solid straight log.  He approached them (they were going to chip it) and asked that, if he had it removed within 24 hours, could he have it?  They said yes, and were happy.  He got a truck to pick it up, and delivered to his house.  He then got a portable sawmill contractor (these are a framed saw that sit around the log and mill it in place, rather than feeding the log through a stationary mill).  They then stacked the green wood in the yard (correctly spaced for airing) and covered it with a tarp and an old sheet of roofing iron.  A couple of years later it was good to go.  About 10-15% was warped and useless but he got lots - and I mean lots - of fantastic oak all cut too sizes he wanted.  From this he worked (and is still working) on building furniture - sideboards, table, a &#x27;piece&#x27; chair, as well as trimming for his mantelpiece and a lot of other things.  He could have sold the surplus for a healthy profit, but instead chooses to keep some and give away others to people who are interested.<p>If you enjoy the process of choosing the right pieces, you&#x27;d love the process of actually selecting a tree and then turning that into long-lasting, quality furniture that will outlast you.<p>EDIT: On that point, some timber is near-impossible to obtain now because of logging restrictions.  However, sometimes individual trees are cleared from urban areas that would never be allowed to be removed from a forest.  If you learn what the trees look like you might get lucky one day.",1399602801

The difference is generally if there&#x27;s an explicit compilation step that is not hidden from developers. If you &quot;run the source file&quot;, then it&#x27;s interpreted. If you &quot;run something generated from the source file(s)&quot;, then it&#x27;s compiled. Stronger type checking and compiled mode is likely since the cost of compilation is higher and more resource intensive, so it makes sense to push it into an offline step.<p>>  You can run C++ or Java with run-time type-checking, but it doesn&#x27;t conform the to spec.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;conforming with the spec&quot;. You can opt out of type checking by using only `object` or `void*`. But golang has a mode where you run a go file directly and a mode where you generate a binary. There are no traditional interpreted languages anymore (or at least only very few). And what we call &quot;compiled&quot; languages today are not actually compiled ones.

If this is your attitude:<p><pre><code>  > I have no doubt I could do a good job with just youtube\n</code></pre>\nI highly suggest you do not go through with this plan. From reading this statement it sounds like you have very little knowledge of renovation/remodeling. There are three big problems<p>1.  Lack of respect for the skill and experience needed in basic trades: electrician/plumber/carpentry. This attitude &quot;oh there is nothing to it, it is just blue collar work. I can watch some youtube videos and learn it in no time&quot; is dangerous, costly and silly/arrogant. Master craftsman take a long time to learn their trade. Your inability to estimate what is needed and how long it will take and what might come up is going to be a giant problem. Experienced tradesmen have seen the 50 different ways people have screwed up plumbing/wiring/etc and has a good idea how to begin a new project and handle these screwups as they are slowly discovered. A lot of the work you will do will be do to &quot;oh shit X is busted&quot; moments, not &quot;Wow, that went smoothly, X is done. Lets proceed to the next item on the outline of work I came up with originally and have not had to deviate from.&quot;<p>2.  It takes a couple of full Xs to get the hang of doing X. Lets take something basic like rocking and taping a room. There is a guy on YT, DryWallGaul, that makes the best drywall videos I have ever seen. I have had a lot of people &quot;teach me the trick to taping&quot; and it never made sense and never came out well. If you watched his videos and practiced hanging sheetrock you could definitely get great walls in due time. The problem is your one year turn around house only has so many walls. I redid almost all of the walls in my house but I never got the hang of it until I hung sheetrock at a 4,000 square foot volunteer project. I went through three left hand mechanix gloves before I got proficient zipping screws into studs. (The let index finger is slowly eaten up from holding the screws)  Maybe you can do a good job on the last bedroom but I promise you your first three bedrooms are going to look like homeowner harry went to war on the weekend. How many opportunities to do X/Y/Z do you think you will have in this one year house?<p>3.  Working by yourself safely is tough.(Especially if its your first time ever doing X) Doing good work, safely, alone is tougher. Doing good work, safely, alone, for the first time and finishing in a year is impossible.<p>My advice is that you volunteer for habitat for humanity or something similar. Get a decent amount of experience under your belt and then rethink this plan. The nice thing about the volunteer &quot;internship&quot; is that you will also be able to get an idea of what tools to buy and which ones you like and you can slowly build up a tool set.<p><i>Drywall Master:</i> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/drywallgall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/drywallgall</a><p>I can&#x27;t say enough about Laurier, he is not only a skilled craftsman--which is rare enough-- but most importantly he is a good teacher.",1399602148

The first project I wanted to take on was to build a replica of the picnic table my grandfather built about 90 years ago.  I remember sitting with him at that table many afternoons, planning projects, talking about cars, life, etc.  So, this table means a lot to me and even though I&#x27;ve taken care of it, the years have caught up and it is rotting away.<p>I built a Sketchup model of the table in its exact form, then I made a copy and started making minor upgrades (I think he&#x27;d approve).  Here&#x27;s the original table along with one of the benches, along with what the updated version is going to look like:\n<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/2a2T0S1W280r"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/2a2T0S1W280r</a>\n<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/1j2q3P2d3V2X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/1j2q3P2d3V2X</a><p>There _is_ a certain process and inherent knowledge that people who shop for things like wood, tools, supplies, etc., just inherently know that seem like huge hurdles for nerds like us.  It&#x27;s &quot;just wood&quot; just like it&#x27;s &quot;just typing&quot; for us. When we&#x27;re rude to a n00b, think about what &quot;old timer&quot; thinks of you going into his parts store or lumber yard in your khakis asking about stuff you don&#x27;t know about.  MOST of them are encouraging and want to share their knowledge, but it&#x27;s really up to us as newbies to take initiative and learn how things work.<p>I had an opportunity last month to buy some shop tools (table, radial arm, band saw, sanding equipment), so I decided to finally give it a real shot.<p>First, I got the equipment set up and watched dozens of youtube videos about each piece of equipment - from keeping them clean and working well to calibrating every possible alignment & went to work making sure they were all perfect.<p>Next, I bought a set of precision rulers, protractors, etc., and made some practice cuts on scrap wood I had in the house/garage/etc.<p>Finally, it was time to buy wood.  I must have watched 25 youtube videos about not just buying wood, but learning about the various cuts and ratings of wood. All very interesting, and I felt like I could at least identify a good bit of lumber from the bad, and it helped to catch up on some of the terminology & etiquette of the lumberyard.  To make a long part of the story short - if you walk into a Lowes or any real lumber yard wearing shop-looking clothes and are carrying a notebook & pen, nobody&#x27;s going to bother you.  You can spend all the time you want looking over the selection, noting prices, etc.  Seriously, this was a major milestone for me to realize.  I ALWAYS feel rushed when I&#x27;m in a store... there was something different and nice about taking time to pick through and find the wood I thought was going to be great.   Of course, if you do this, don&#x27;t make a mess and put everything back the way you found it.<p>Another hurdle was that I didn&#x27;t think (at first) I could fit lumber in my car.  I drive a crossover and discovered that the passenger seat folds flat, leaving plenty of room for 8&#x27; lumber.  I can fit 10&#x27; in diagonally if I let it touch the dash.  You might be surprised what you can fit in your car when you fold the seats down & give it a measure.<p>Anyway, with the wood all loaded up, I got home and started planning my cuts.  I printed the sketchup model and started documenting everything - making notes of how I can get the most of each board, figuring out which order I should tackle them in, how I&#x27;d arrange the mounting bits, etc.  Honestly, I probably spent 5 minutes planning for every 30 seconds of cutting.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal, but it was actually kindof exciting to make some cuts, get out the protractor, and find that I was dead on with what the model said I should be.<p>I wrote WAY more than I expected. This particular post and topic really hit me though.  Here are some more pics of the work - I have most of the table completed and ready for assembly. The benches are finished & ready to be sealed, though. They came out pretty well, especially for my first project.<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/3z2C2F072M1K"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/3z2C2F072M1K</a>\n<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/0Q06180Q2y3q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/0Q06180Q2y3q</a>\n<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/2U3f3q1n2Y1W"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/2U3f3q1n2Y1W</a>\n<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/1Y3d0l123L35"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/1Y3d0l123L35</a>\n<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/1X410N281K11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/1X410N281K11</a>\n<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/3g2k3j3f3E1P"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/3g2k3j3f3E1P</a>",1399601711

The desire to reinforce the territorial claim to Tibet was why all the considerable engineering difficulties were overcome with sufficient resources to push through the project.",1399600961

When other languages/frameworks are wrapping or calling openssl, it&#x27;s a really nice feeling to have a common crypto algorithms implemented in your languge/platform.  Same goes for image encoding/decoding, database access, lots of examples.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s the benefit of (essentially) standard builds, project layout, dependency management, and deployment strategies (jar or war).  A java developer can walk into a new job and be productive right away.",1399600864

It seems we are definitionally cordoning off where and how computation occurs in consciousness.",1399600825

The self-promotion is completely unhelpful in directing my attention to anything useful, but it is designed specifically to try to fool me.<p>Nobody needs advertising to be ""willing to buy stuff.""  Advertising shifts demand around from companies that are worse at advertising to companies that are better at it.  What do you suppose people would do with their portion of the GDP if there were less advertising?  Sit on their hands, because they don't aspire to anything?  Would men, their savings accounts bulging with useless money, moan, ""I only wish I wanted an iPad more?""

The physicist made a self-deprecating joke about how he sees his occupation as not terribly productive (I guess he saw his own potential for making a big discovery as pretty slim), but then remarked with some relief that at least the fact that he can dedicate his life to research is ""a sign of a wealthy society."" Immediately after that, he went up in arms against the guy in advertising, confronting him with, ""but what do <i>you</i> do that's useful?"" I had to interject, telling the physicist, that without people willing to buy stuff including all the plastic toys (chemical engineering) and fancy gadgets (electrical and computer engineering), there would be much less currency floating around in the economy and we wouldn't have the wealthy society he spoke of just a minute ago, in which case the big physics projects like the LHC would not get funded (i.e. we would be back to the 18th century or earlier).",1304995739

2531061,comment,2530754,2530765,4,0,yurisagalov,,,"IRC operators and Channel operators are very different.<p>IRC servers have IRC operators. They are volunteers who make sure that the server remains connected to the network (They can split/reconnect leaf nodes and hubs to/from other servers based on pre-defined rules in the IRC daemon's configuration. This allows you to rebalance the network, and reconnect servers if a central hub goes down/becomes unresponsive). They are also in charge of ""policing"" the network, they have the ability to kill (ban) users who misbehave, re-assign control in channels which are ""taken over"", and so on.<p>I've never been on Anon's IRC network, but most IRC networks these days use a ""network services"" scheme to automate the policing of channels (e.g. ChanServ/NickServ on DALnet/Freenode/Other networks, X/W on Undernet. They are essentially sophisticated robots that have IRC-operator priviliges. They can make someone a channel moderator, automatically ban users by ip/hostname/etc, as well as numerous other functions... I believe EFnet is one of the few ""major"" networks that doesn't have a services scheme). In any case, a channel takeover, or what this wiki entry referrs to as internet relay chat takeover, can only happen temporarily. Most servers will reset the channel to pre-split conditions upon reconnection. Moreover, any IRCop can reset the channel's operators/moderators/numerous other settings.<p>The problem in this case was that an IRCop misbehaved, not a channel operator :)<p>(I grew up on IRC...can you tell? ;)<p>edit: I'm aware I'm not using proper terminology for most of these things; this is on purpose.",1304995357

They throw powerpoint, visio, word, excel on top of that, plus the operating system, and they own it.  From an operating system standpoint, there's not any real threat.  From a productivity suites perspective, there's a bit more threat from cloud, but it's still comparatively small.  Same can be said for email - gmail is a much larger threat but for corporate security, calendaring, integration, it's still not really there.  This will probably be different in 5 years as the proprietary  protocols and integrations move towards open standards.  I find it ridiculous that I can't find another desktop email client that will natively work with exchange/MAPI, and Microsoft knows it.  Skype is just extending it to the desktop, and it's a strong part of the desktop suite.  I think they want to play in the enterprise space, because nobody wants to use Lync for anything other than IM (aforementioned turd comment here).",1304995253

I was the founder / developer that wrote the stats system for JIRA, and I'm quite proud of that code! :)<p>But I'm worried as I've read a few people on this thread say that JIRA is made for managers and not for developers.  As the guy who was here from the beginning - I can say that it is definitely true that we made JIRA target managers - we found that too many people using Bugzilla spent all their time reporting status upwards, and if we could automate this, then developers could spend more time coding, and less time reporting.<p>But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be a great experience for developers.  As someone who longs for the day that I can spend 10 hours coding (I'm now co-CEO, so I don't get to code as much anymore), I want JIRA to rock for this use-case.<p>But I'd love your feedback on where we need to improve.  What is the 'inner loop' of JIRA usage for yourself?  What functions do you do 20 times a day that we should make lightening fast?<p>I'd also love to know which version you are using.  We've made some serious speed improvements in the last 12 months, as well as introducing keyboard shortcuts for the most common actions, so you can get around much faster than you used to.

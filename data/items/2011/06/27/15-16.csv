For many people, spending the $10/year on a private domain with the 10 account limit would be more than sufficient.  Allocate one of those accounts to a strictly administrative role with 2 factor authentication.  That way, you can self-serve on things like emergency password resets etc.",1309190373

It's the US Government who keeps pushing for policies like these, and who is disregarding due process whenever they think they can get away with it.<p>And finally, it's the US people who are at blame for being content living under such policies, and not speaking out enough against them and trying to stop them from materializing or trying to get them cancelled - allowing the Patriot Act to continue, allowing the TSA to not only exist, but also expand outside the airports, not speaking out against the Protect IP, and so on.",1309190327

2701768,comment,2696283,2699744,2,0,ckarelis,,,"From Charles Karelis. To begin with, I don't think the kinds of income transfers from rich to poor that would significantly raise aggregate utility from consumption are in fact politically unfeasible, so I am, as you appreciate, reluctant to get into this what-if area.<p>That said, taxing the poor and transferring the money to the middle class let alone to the rich would carry big negatives according to my approach. We ought to care not only about maximizing aggregate satisfaction from consumption, but about autonomy, including maintaining people's incentives to acquire what they want to consume through their own efforts. Making poor people even poorer will (on my hypothesis) lower (not raise) the marginal utility of their consumption and thereby undermine (not strengthen) their motivation for self-help. If someone with six bee-stings has enough salve to relieve five and the state takes that salve away, this action will probably reduce rather than increase the effort the person will make to get the salve needed to relieve a single sting, because the salve needed to relieve a single sting will make less difference now that the other salve has been confiscated.<p>A fuller answer to your objection than I can give here--including a discussion of the roots of the moral intuition behind your question--is offered in the last chapter of Persistence of Poverty.",1309190298

This is one instance where you can't blame it on them, unless you're saying that they should pull out of the U.S. (which the author did).<p>But Google is an american company. They've got huge investments in their U.S. facilities. Many of their developers live in the U.S. Many of their data-centers are in the U.S. Pulling out of the U.S. would come with a huge price for them and it isn't really feasible.<p>So instead of blaming Google, why not blame the government for extending / prolonging the Patriot Act? Heck, why not blame it on Obama, since all his preellection talks about civil liberties were clearly bullshit?<p>This reminds me of that South Park episode: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douche_and_Turd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douche_and_Turd</a>",1309190281

For example, most junior pilots commute to work because your duty station is a function of seniority and they don't want to live in the shitty places they have been assigned to.  So, such a pilot might start his day in the city where he actually lives, catch a ride in the jump seat from there to his duty station and <i>then</i> begin his work day, which is allowed to be up to 16 hours long (the actual hours of flying allowed is less than 16, but the time from when he shows up to work to when he has to stop flying is 16 hours unless the airline imposes a more conservative limit).

2701555,comment,2698246,2700931,1,0,fmw,,,"Contrary to your assumption I've done a reasonable amount of traveling. This summer, for example, I'm working from Paris for a month. I've done an internship in the US and visited four continents and around fourteen countries. I'm not done traveling, because there is so much left to see and experience, but I do have a little international perspective.<p>I tried to give some perspective with my post, but didn't intend to be overly pessimistic. In fact, I applaud your initiative (in hindsight, I could've been more clear about that). That being said, I still think that we lack an entrepreneurial culture here in the Netherlands[1] and that the image of intellectual and cultural freedom that might attract foreign startups has lost part of its shine in the last decade of isolationism[2], high-profile political murders and racial tension.<p>I do wish to concede on my point that Amsterdam isn't really a local technical startup hub in the first place, apart from the creative industry and mobile applications. From the Dutch perspective this might be true, as we have more advanced hubs in Enschede/Twente and Eindhoven, but from an international perspective distances are so small that this isn't really a factor and your initiative seems to be broader than just Amsterdam anyway. Amsterdam definitely has more allure to foreigners than provincial towns like Eindhoven and Enchede. E.g. Utrecht is one of the universities on the forefront of the Haskell community and this city is 30 minutes by train from Amsterdam. Groningen is a bit further, but their university has some great hackers working on cool stuff too (like two NLP specialists that are also on HN: <a href=""http://nlpwp.org/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nlpwp.org/book/</a>).<p>Other than the ""inappropriately pessimistic"" tone, is there anything in my post you disagree with on a factual basis? I do consider myself an optimist, by the way, because you almost have to be as a startup guy. So what you might consider ""inappropriate pessimism"" is realistic optimism to me. I do wish your initiative to succeed and it is a lot more promising than the government-funded campaigns we've seen. I'm highly skeptical about government intervention because it rarely (if ever) works. Private initiatives like Appsterdam do have potential, though. In fact, I'm hoping to attend one of your meetings to see what all the fuzz is about.<p>[1] The Dutch people aren't very much inclined towards risk taking and entrepreneurialism, to say the least. Also, high taxes and business-unfriendly labour laws aren't helpful either. Contrary to the American Dream, we have a culture of applauding the average and consensus. We're keen on making money and sometimes prone to mass hysteria when speculating (e.g. the famous 17th century Tulip Mania and the more recent WorldOnline debacle), but the average Dutchman frowns on people that want to excel. A typical Dutch saying is ""Doe maar gewoon, dan doe je al gek genoeg"" (lose translation: ""Just be normal and average, that is sufficiently special and crazy"").<p>[2] E.g. the majority of the country is very negative about the EU and the Euro, famously voting against the very reasonable referendum on the European 'constitution' a few years back out of spite towards the political elite. These people live in a world where they think everything got more expensive since the introduction of the Euro, while in fact the opposite is true.",1309187386

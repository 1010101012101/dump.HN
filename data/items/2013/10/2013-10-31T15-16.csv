How could he know they were encrypted unless he intercepted a payload?<p>> With the speakers and mic intact, Ruiu said, the isolated computer seemed to be using the high-frequency connection to maintain the integrity of the badBIOS infection as he worked to dismantle software components the malware relied on.<p>What would be the point of this communication?

6647529,comment,6645977,6647434,2,0,EGreg,,,"Don&#x27;t confuse the two things. Force is not 100% or 0%. In your system the &quot;men with guns&quot; still come to evict you from your house when you fail to pay the rent, therefore you are coerced into earning money.<p>You pay attention to the &quot;force&quot; used on the taxpayer. When you do business in a jurisdiction then it often imposes taxes, but you are free not to do business there.<p>But what about the &quot;force&quot; used on the person living paycheck to paycheck? The government enFORCEs property rights (or, without government, it would be private mercenaries that do it) and so the wage earner is still forced to do what he doesn&#x27;t necessarily want to do.<p>So although it may be that neither your employer nor any individual is coercing you to work for that industry, nevertheless you can be coerced by the system. Because what is force, really? Can you give me an example of force? Perhaps nanobots in your bloodstream forcing you to do something is force. Because if someone puts a gun to your head, you still have a choice: you can choose to die, or do what he says. The point is that force is whenever your alternative options are completely unacceptable to you. And homelessness / hunger for days are such things. Exposing humans to market discipline without ANY safety nets results in many of them being coerced -- not by an individual -- but by their circumstances -- to continue in a path that may not benefit them or even others. J K Rowling was for example able to make Harry Potter into a billion dollar industry only because she was able to afford to write it. She was a welfare recipient at the time.",1383234859

Even if public schools don&#x27;t have the resources to hire a teacher who is, by training, a programmer, there is no reason why students can&#x27;t be exposed to things like Codecademy, Coursera, and Udacity.  Online courses with syllabi could even be offered to students (a teacher could simply verify that the work was being completed and that the code works) as replacements for the joke of a &quot;computers&quot; requirement that I had to complete, where the final was just making a PowerPoint, and half the class just played Oregon Trail during. I don&#x27;t think &quot;everyone should code!&quot; should be the goal, it should be that &quot;everyone should be truly exposed to coding while in school.&quot;<p>Now that I am talking about it, there are so many basic things that people should be introduced to in public school, some of which used to be mandatory (I believe).  Things like basic accounting/personal finance, some intro level cooking course (make sure people can boil water and follow a simple recipe), some kind of shop like class, etc.  California has a &quot;visual arts&quot; requirement that is much less useful to most students over the course of their life than most of the courses I just named.

His rebounding numbers dropped, but he no longer plays down low as much, because LeBron and Wade need space there.  They also ignore that he&#x27;s become nearly as good as Dirk Nowitzki at long 2&#x27;s, which is generally an inefficient shot (unless you hit it at the rate the two of them do), which spaces the court very effectively, especially given Miami&#x27;s 3 point shooters.  He redesigned his game to fit into a really unique system that has ended with them in the Finals every single year.<p>He then tops all of this off with really insightful thoughts for a high level athlete (not saying athletes aren&#x27;t capable of this, but they unsurprisingly tend to dedicate the vast majority of their mental bandwidth towards their sport), and a fantastic sense of humor.

VP8 cannot be added to those devices. Practically every device supports AVC and new devices will continue to do so anyway for compatibility with existing systems and services so inclusion of VP8 would always be additional on the VAST majority of devices.<p>> Mozilla has been resisting Googles libre codecs even though they come with full source code and a patent pledge. Google has already even paid to eliminate potential threat from the evil MPEG LA. It is as free(libre) as you can get in this space.<p>Probably true although Nokia wasn&#x27;t in the MPEG-LA VP8 pool and was bringing legal action.  Not sure where this went but it might still be &quot;as free(libre) as you can get in this space&quot; without reverting to MPEG1 on which the patents should be expired by now.<p>> On the other hand, the Cisco plugin is no solution at all. A binary module that has to be downloaded by each user? How can Mozilla justify recommending/requiring a binary module whose source it can not view/audit/share? This approach wouldn&#x27;t be permitted under Debian Free Software Guidelines, thus ensuring that WebRTC-Firefox won&#x27;t work on debian and its derivatives.<p>As others have said it is auditable and open source.  Debian could offer an option to download or not include it either leaving nothing or offering an non patent licensed FFMPEG decoder or the Cisco one without license or others.<p>Actually source distribution is probably not patent infringement and neither is personal use so for many people they could freely build from source themselves. Businesses may need to use the Cisco binary or otherwise procure a license.<p>Practically there is no barrier even if there is an ideological one. I don&#x27;t expect Stallman to use the Cisco binary although few of us adhere as consistently to the free software lifestyle (and even he makes practical compromises sometimes).<p>> Cisco benefits from H.264 winning the standards battle. They also have patents in the MPEG LA pool. Apple, MS and Cisco - none of them are under any obligations to provide a libre implementation of WebRTC. Only Google and Mozilla have that responsibility. And they can make it happen today by just agreeing to go with VP8 and VP9 when it lands (both are covered by the patent pledge as well as under the MPEG LA agreement).<p>Cisco mainly win by being able to sell gear that is compatible everywhere without needing to bake in two codecs and have transcoding gear everywhere for when a Firefox/Chrome wants to talk to a phone user.<p>> H.264 is a defacto standard already, I understand. But google, with its control of youtube and Android, can make a serious dent in that. If Moz and Google ensure that VP8 becomes the de-jure WebRTC standard, a Free software implementation of that can be released by mozilla today. No need to wait for Dwolla to come to fruition.<p>It is an international standard too. Google could have made a dent in it a couple of years ago at the cost of some real fraction of Youtube traffic and revenue but it didn&#x27;t. Moz and Google cannot ensure VP8 becomes the de-jure WebRTC standard because of the existing mobile hardware. [I haven&#x27;t been following Dwolla so no comment on that].<p>> I&#x27;d really like to understand what I am missing here.<p>You are missing that AVC won the battle for the generation of video codecs we are currently using at sometime around 2005. (The competition at the time was VC-1, Xiph&#x27;s video codecs were nowhere near at the time).<p>You are missing the practical benefits of ubiquity and especially mobile the benefits of hardware support.<p>I hope Monty is right and that Daala is going to be sufficiently better than HEVC in time to be relevant for the next generation and that it is free of patents. If that doesn&#x27;t happen we will need to wait for about 2015[1] for a truly free and Free video ubiquitous video codec and that will be AVC when all the patents have expired.<p>[1] Estimate, I haven&#x27;t checked the expiry dates, all should have been filed well before then but the grant dates are also critical.",1383231814

If you read my first comment I knew that I was disputing that he had any right to comment on hardware as he did which would put him into the electrical or mechanical engineering. As for getting hired with a CPS as a software engineer, uh yeah it&#x27;s not identical but that&#x27;s the same area as I mentioned in my later posts.",1383231746

He has a right to this opinion, whether you agree with it or even if you consider it right or wrong.<p>But anytime someone is allowed to shut down an opposing viewpoint it will eventually lead to problems. Once someone has the ability to shut down one opposing viewpoint they disagree with, then they will have the power to shut down any viewpoint they disagree with. Possibly even shutting down a viewpoint they think is of the opposition when it&#x27;s likely it&#x27;s not, such as a misunderstanding or being inarticulate.<p>The difference being, a person actually has to commit actions against another human being to for a reaction need to take place. If someone says he doesn&#x27;t like gays, fine, let the guy state his outdated rant and get on with your day. The moment the guy actually discriminates or commits an illegal act, then do something.<p>As for consequences, this movie is an excellent example. If you boycott the movie because of your disagreement with Card, then you are hurting far more people then you will ever hurt Card. Another example, the Chik-Fil-A boycott a while back. That hurt local businesses run by local owners who employ local people far more than the dude at the top that still got paid no matter how much chicken you refused to eat.<p>If anyone has the generic &quot;you seem to defend what I don&#x27;t like so I dislike you&quot; reaction to this post, you are practically proving my point.",1383231712

Essentially, anyone with root access to the front-end server. That doesn&#x27;t leave behind any traces.<p>Same for breaking into the networks (like the NSA did with the Google data center interconnections): you only need to know into which fiber you have to place a tap module into. And a subpoena or whatever against the company providing the fiber service (as most of the fibers are leased to Google by  some other infrastructure company).",1383231711

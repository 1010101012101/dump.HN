Indeed, the article states this:<p>""Its aim was to guarantee a swift transition to capitalism, before Soviet sympathisers could seize back the reins of power.""<p>In other words, the goal of rapid privatization was to prevent, at any cost, the return of Communism. Was that a good idea, from an economic point of view? Probably not. But an ideology that, several times, nearly plunged the world into a nuclear war, and was responsible for the deaths of over a hundred million people, between the gulags, famines, and the Great Leap Forward, might have generated a bit of fear among the Western countries, who wanted to get rid of Communism as quickly as possible.

Now, to get all the angry mathematicians from stabbing me, here's another truth: bad software engineers (i.e., people who do software engineering but aren't good at it) are useful and are often paid real money for what they do. Bad mathematicians are chased away and either become jobless or find a new destination of being a physicist, software engineer, or restaurant owner, because bad mathematics doesn't pay for itself.<p>Intuition (the thing that the article's author bumps his head against without noticing it) is really important in mathematics, even though its importance is usually played down wrt. the importance of handling the technical details (correctness of a proof, keeping mathematical structures in your head). In fact, the same faculty used for the formal work is also used for your mathematical intuitions, but then the intuitions are turned into a proof by checking and re-checking how it all fits together.<p>Eugenia Cheng (a category theorist) uses the term ""morality"" for the mathematical equivalent of design patterns:

The converse of this is ""Don't decouple related things"", which is equally valid yet often ignored. Decoupling X and Y means that in the cases where you want to use X and Y together you need to connect them together again. This is a bad thing if in 99% of the cases you want to use X and Y together.<p>An example of this is the Java file API. In an effort to decouple a reference to a file, a reference to a stream of the file's contents, a reference to an arbitrary stream, reading from a stream, and reading from a stream in a buffered way, we end up with FIVE classes (File, FileInputStream, DataInputStream, InputStreamReader, BufferedReader) that will almost always be used together simply to read the contents of a file. This is of course an extreme example. A better design is to ""couple"" these things together in a gimmeTheContentsAlready(filename).<p>Likewise, the Opa guys are expecting that most people who use their stuff will use their database interface, and their language on both the server and the client, their easy client/server networking, and their http server.

3771409,comment,3770914,3770914,3,0,crewtide,,,"""Some economists argue that mass privatisation would have worked if it had been implemented even more rapidly and extensively."" This is always the argument about any failed policy.  These researchers should do a wider study that includes privatization efforts before 1990.<p>We could conduct some pretty sweet experiments in virtual worlds.  Would libertarianism really work if it were the law? A real welfare state?  Privatization of a communist country?  Start a virtual world with those laws and see what happens.  Some obvious drawbacks include:\n- self-selection of participants (you could get around this by controlling who is allowed to participate)\n- lower motivation (being unable to pay your actual rent has a pretty different effect from having a low virtual bank account balance)\n- natural anonymity of avatars (there are plenty of things people do online they'd never do in real life)<p>But a well-done research study could probably account for a lot of those things.<p>Maybe the IMF should conduct some virtual world experiments before shoving their current pet policy down the throats of millions of people whose government just collapsed.  This isn't the first complaint I've heard that goes, ""The policy forced on X country by the IMF turns out to have ruined everything. Oops.""",1333033909

Good times, indeed.<p>I don't think naming a test app ""Testosterone"" is particularly sexist, especially next to a lot of what we've seen happening recently, but I think he's making the right decision by renaming it and publicly acknowledging the issue.<p>Sexism is a continuum. This clearly isn't as egregious as the ""CouchDB + Ruby: Perform Like a Pr0n Star."" talk at gogaruco or last weeks' Geeklist kerfuffle, but we need to recognize that there is a pervasive boys club atmosphere in much of the programming world.<p>Testosterone and projects/attitudes like it set up this association of ""doing X, which is tricky and requires great knowledge or skill from the programmer"" is ""manly"" and ""manly"" is a positive thing. OK, Testosterone also makes a play on using curses as being manly, which is clever, but this is certainly a pervasive attitude (I remember Linus Torvalds famously making  a statement to the effect of ""Debugging with printk puts hair on your chest"" as justification for not including debugging facilities in the Linux kernel). This kind of language is common and many of us (even women) are guilty of using it in varying degrees. Individually, these aren't a big deal. But the overall atmosphere is off-putting to many and we need to at least be aware of that.<p>I applaud Chad for responding in a professional and respectful manner. We need more of this and less of the ""I'm sorry you found that offensive"" non-apology apology attitude that's been the typical response.

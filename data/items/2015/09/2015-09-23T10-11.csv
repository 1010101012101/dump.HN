And they are all totally useless for advertising. If I watch a let&#x27;s play on some game, ads for the game or similar games will half of the time lead to me buying it. Current tracking ads will show me an ad for something I bought a week ago next to the video, and one week later, after I have the game, I&#x27;ll see ads for the game everywhere.<p>𝗪𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘀<p>If I load a website, I don&#x27;t want to get a metaphorical – or for some people, quite realistic – epileptic shock. I want to be able to enjoy the content. The ads should be visible (not just plain text), but they should not be annoying or misleading. Don&#x27;t put 20 ads looking like download buttons on a download page, or I&#x27;ll stop recommending your page – or, worse, recommend people to install an AdBlock extension.<p>𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘄𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗻&#x27;𝘁<p>Obviously, this all only helps for affiliate-type ads, not for Brand Awareness. But for those, there is a far better solution, that is far more successful: Viral Marketing. Often, Brand Awareness works best through marketing that is fun to watch, fun to interact with. In that case, a minigame as ad in your Facebook stream, or a fun video on YouTube can be far more effective.<p>Disclaimer: This is just my personal opinion.",1443005836

10264215,comment,10256479,10262305,0,0,simoncion,,,"I assume that you&#x27;re asking &quot;How do I advertise a ULA prefix on my LAN, as a home user?&quot;. If you&#x27;re not, then the following probably won&#x27;t answer your question. If you&#x27;re already familiar with ULA prefix generation and IPv6 prefix advertisment, and are just trying to find out how to advertise on your home router, almost all of the following will be redundant information. (I&#x27;m happy to read the manual for your make and model of router and try to see if you <i>can</i> easily advertise prefixes on it. :) )<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much experience you have with screwing around with router settings, your level of familiarity with IP networking concepts, or even what software you&#x27;re using on your router, so I&#x27;ll give some background information on prefix advertisement, and describe prefix generation and  how you might actually advertise a ULA prefix on a router running OpenWRT. Because the underlying software that does the work <i>should</i> be the same regardless of router model, reading about how it is done on OpenWRT <i>might</i> give you a starting point to discover how it&#x27;s done -if it is at all- on your router model. I&#x27;m more than happy to clarify anything that&#x27;s confusing, give additional information, or track down and read documentation for a particular router!<p>Background information:<p>Many routers use a piece of software called radvd to advertise IPv6 routes. Radvd -effectively- takes a list of network interfaces, each with a list of router advertisment options, and transmits advertisements on those interfaces. radvd has a config file whose syntax is documented here [0]. A minimal radvd config file would look like<p><pre><code>  interface eth0
  {
    AdvSendAdvert on;
    prefix ::/64
    {
      AdvOnLink on;
      AdvAutonomous on;
    };
  };
</code></pre>
This would instruct radvd to advertise whatever prefix had been assigned to the interface named eth0 to machines attached <i>to</i> eth0. Note that an interface section can have multiple prefix sections. If you have a particular prefix that you <i>want</i> to advertise, replace &quot;::/64&quot; with that prefix. The overwhelming majority of options in the radvd config file are both entirely optional, and entirely unneeded in most situations.<p>Now, I suspect that on most routers that support prefix advertisement, you&#x27;ll never need to touch an radvd config file. Like I said, this is just background information. So, let&#x27;s get to generating your ULA prefix:<p>Generating your ULA prefix:<p>Get the MAC address of a computer that you control.<p>Go to <a href=""https://www.sixxs.net/tools/grh/ula/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sixxs.net/tools/grh/ula/</a> and plug that MAC address into the MAC address field on the page. You&#x27;ll get a value back that of the form: fdaa:aaaa:aaaa::/48 This is your ULA prefix.<p>Advertising a /48 is kind of awkward for downstream devices. You need to carve out a /64. So, take that ULA prefix, add a colon and four zeroes to it and replace the /48 with a /64 like so: fdaa:aaaa:aaaa:0000::/64 You can now go to advertise this on your LAN. [1]<p>Advertising the prefix:<p>I actually have no idea what the prefix advertisement option is called on most consumer routers, or if it even exists on <i>your</i> router. A quick look at Belkin&#x27;s and Linksys&#x27;s support sites didn&#x27;t turn up anything promising. I would dig around in the IPv6 settings tabs until I found something that looked promising, or had exhausted all options. [2]<p>If you&#x27;re using a recent version of OpenWRT (That is, OpenWRT Barrier Breaker or later), /etc/config/network has a ula_prefix option in the globals section that&#x27;s used for <i>exactly</i> this. [3][4]<p>If you&#x27;re using a version of OpenWRT <i>earlier</i> than Barrier Breaker, you can tell radvd to advertise your ULA on your LAN interfaces. The prefix section of /etc/config/radvd is used for this. /etc/config/radvd is documented here [6]. You <i>can</i> have multiple prefix sections for each LAN interface. [7]<p>Now, reload the network config (Call /etc/init.d/network with either the reload or restart option, I can&#x27;t remember which.), wait for a minute or two, and machines on your LAN should have a new IPv6 address in the /64 that we carved out of the ULA.<p>If everything&#x27;s working, -optionally- register your newly-generated prefix with SixXS at the page where you generated your ULA prefix.<p>Feel free to ask any questions that you have. :D<p>[0] <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/5/radvd.conf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux.die.net/man/5/radvd.conf</a><p>[1] Note that you can create 16 bits worth of networks out of your /48, not just one network.<p>[2] If you can tell me the make and model of your router, I&#x27;d be happy to try to find and read the documentation for it. :)<p>[3] <a href=""http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</a><p>[4] Though, to be frank, I can&#x27;t remember if you plug in the /48 and it automatically creates /64s for each LAN interface that you have configured [5], or if you can only plug a single /64 into it. I would try the /48 first.<p>[5] OpenWRT lets you set up multiple LAN interfaces. I found this useful when I was using VLANs to make isolated WiFi guest networks.<p>[6] <a href=""http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/radvd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/radvd</a><p>[7] So, if you have IPv6 service from your ISP, you can advertise the ISP-provided prefix <i>and</i> your ULA prefix. Have one prefix section that contains <i>no</i> prefix option, and a second prefix section that contains a prefix option whose value is the /64 that you created earlier.",1443003672

Solving the problems is the better solution but in the face of how impossible it is due to the changing landscape maybe it would be a good idea to educate tech illiterate people instead. I think it&#x27;s a viable alternative with possible positive side-effects of getting enough momentum to make legal solutions possible as well.<p>Additionally, sad news is that there a lot of people who don&#x27;t care about their privacy or the homeless however hard <i>you</i> find that to believe.",1443002441

In other words, if you are scheduled to run on a thread, you and only you have access to that thread stack.<p>Stack switching doesn&#x27;t take more than a few machine instructions.<p>The problem with tcsetattr is that it&#x27;s a library function, so you (generally[1]) need the target library in order to create a program that calls it. This is bad because in Go we value cross-compiling a lot, so we can&#x27;t depend on having other people&#x27;s shared libraries available in the build environment.<p>Syscalls, however, we know how to do them and we know what they are, so we don&#x27;t need any special target library in order to generate programs for the target.<p>[1] On platforms like Solaris and Windows, where we are forced to use target shared libraries, we cheat a little and encode the target symbol names that we need, and we rely on standardized ELF/PE symbol resolution mechanism creating a scheme that&#x27;s essentially equivalent to having import libraries available. But this is very complicated and takes a lot of code in the linker, so it&#x27;s not at all unexpected that we avoid it whenever possible.",1443002423

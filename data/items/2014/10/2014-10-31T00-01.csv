Some folks argue that Box is in better shape than it might appear to be in[3], but this is based on assumptions which may or may not prove to be valid[4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://kellblog.com/2014/03/27/burn-baby-burn-a-look-at-the-box-s-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kellblog.com/2014/03/27/burn-baby-burn-a-look-at-the-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tomtunguz.com/box-ipo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tomtunguz.com/box-ipo/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-boxs-aaron-levie-is-a-genius-2014-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-boxs-aaron-levie-is...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://kellblog.com/2014/05/15/the-box-s-1-delayed-ipo-and-the-genius-of-tien-zuo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kellblog.com/2014/05/15/the-box-s-1-delayed-ipo-and-t...</a>",1414717184

You can come back in 24 hours and vote based on the real outcome of a couple of these points, hehe:<p>- Anakata will get a sentence somewhere in the upper middle. My guess is 4-5 years of which he has already served some.<p>- JT will get a somewhat mild sentence of nothing higher than 1 year. The case against him is pretty weak, compared to Anakata.<p>- The case will almost instantly be appealed by Anakata.<p>- JT may not want to appeal if the sentence is somewhere in the middle of the 2 years window. The reason is the extra jail time he has served will be compensated by the state and the state might be seeking a sentence in the middle to &quot;encourage&quot; him not to appeal. Appealing might increase the sentence and you would be paid less.<p>The case might go all the way to højestreret, which is the highest court in Denmark. There is also a chance the case could end up in ECHR (European Court of Human Rights), though I feel that chance is slighter. It would depend on the sentence of JT. If it ends up being a conditional sentence, then the jail time he has served is definitely going to have been unfair. As for Anakata, it is a bit more bleak I feel, since the argument of flight from the country applies, like it did in Sweden.<p>What is <i>really</i> likely to push this to ECHR however, is the inhumane isolation jail treatment and harsh conditions they&#x27;ve both received.

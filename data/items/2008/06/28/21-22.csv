The price is very competative, tech support exists, and they accomodate special requests with no particular hassle (e.g. please make sure my two VPSs are in different data centers).<p>Last time they had a problem was a few years ago (server hardware failure) and they bothered to give updates frequently and rapidly opened up new temporary hosts for customers who had backups to restore from. Pretty good service for a 'no support' plan.",1214690326
230789,comment,230614,230782,0,0,aantix,,,"While trying to pin down what exactly Gladwell is concluding is generally difficult, you're certainly right, his gift is definitely in the story telling.<p>And honestly, that's good enough for me.  While I believe that I am up to date on the latest in Computer Science I am not well read on the any of the recent or popular studies going on in social psychology.  And Gladwell brings that research to the forefront.<p>Gladwell was the first to expose me to Paul Eckman's work; a man that has dedicated his life to recording and interpreting the micro-expressions that individual faces take on as different emotions escape us.<p>This led me to think ""Oh, this would be greatly if I could interpret these expressions and use them in my weekly poker game.""  And sure enough Mr. Eckman offers a training CD.\n<a href=""http://www.paulekman.com/cds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulekman.com/cds.html</a><p>Gladwell is dusting off the basement academic journals, painting them with great story telling, and shining a spotlight on the research.  And that has merit.",1214690214

230787,comment,230700,230700,0,0,gaius,,,"A PM's job is to manage <i>the project</i>. If someone's falling behind, find out why and do what you can. But don't ever make the mistake of thinking that because your title is ""manager"" that you're in charge. Remember that you need the engineers on-side to fulfill your obligations. Remember that  the demand on engineers is higher than the supply - they can easily justify working on someone else's ""more important"" project, then yours slips and slips and you find yourself trying to explain to your boss but you don't know why. But you can easily impress engineers by demonstrating that you are on top of all the details. You've got a plan, you know what needs to be done (and you trust the engineers for the <i>how</i>), you know what everyone needs, you've got all the dependencies figured out, you've chased all the external suppliers, you've chased the internal stakeholders, there is <i>nothing</i> stopping anyone getting right to work. In that situation, your engineers will make you look <i>great</i> to your boss.",1214690136

230782,comment,230614,230614,0,0,gruseom,,,"Gladwell is a good storyteller. He weaves disparate things together in a way that seems convincing and brilliant at first but dissolves on inspection. When challenged, his answer is, Oh of course I never said that anything was <i>true</i>.<p>I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, entertainment is fine, Gladwell is an intellectual entertainer, nothing wrong with that. On the other hand, his narratives do depend on an implicit claim to being true discoveries about how the world works; they're not nearly as valuable and interesting if they're not.<p>If you look up the definition of ""charlatan"", Gladwell is perilously close to it.",1214689141

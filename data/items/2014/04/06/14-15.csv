Not sure what the quality is like though, and not sure if the technology generalizes to the fully blind (who may have entirely atrophied optic nerves).",1396796384

7541137,comment,7540232,7540640,8,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;ve noticed two things as I&#x27;ve grown older.<p>1. Time just seems to move <i>sooo</i> fast. When I was 6, 30 minutes seemed like <i>forever</i>. Now as I close in on 40, 30 minutes feels like a handful of breaths. I can easily spend 2 hours on something, feel like I made no progress because the time is short. Even into my 20s, I felt like I could crank out tons of things hour after hour. Now the work of a week feels like the work of a day.<p>2. I think why this happens is that I&#x27;ve noticed I feel like I take in more space-time at once than I used to. Hypersmall details I used to obsess over seem to blend into an entire scene. I&#x27;m gulping space-time rather than sipping it. I think it&#x27;s because I have much more experience and knowledge than I used to that I just automatically filter out most things. &quot;Bigger picture&quot; isn&#x27;t just a word to me anymore. I&#x27;ve largely stopped thinking in hyper-local ways and started thinking more strategically, in terms of systems rather than components and in terms of aggregate behaviors rather than individual behaviors, etc.<p>I have to consciously focus down my attention onto small, local concerns when it used to just happen. When thinking about business ideas, I don&#x27;t think as much about smaller concerns like the technology stack or whatever, but where I can take the entire idea over the next 5-10 years. Ideas grow like trees in my mind stretching out for a decade without mush effort, but looking at an individual leaf (which used to be easy), is exhausting.<p>It&#x27;s given me a lot more understanding of what my parents are going through as they age, things I never really understood when I was a precocious child, but now make perfect sense. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re going through now, but now that I understand roughly the trajectory of my own mind and thinking, I can kind of see how they&#x27;re arriving at where they are.",1396796207

That&#x27;s why everything probably fell through after his death. He probably funded most of it with his time and money, took all the shortcuts he could because he had to (hence the poor reliability - it failed after eight weeks), and asked the patients to pay for the rest.<p>It&#x27;s not a dystopic science fiction story, it&#x27;s how slow and cumbersome and real world engineering based medical research works, and how the only way to make any meaningful progress fast enough (if you&#x27;re not in one of the few well funded and well staffed places in the world, working on one of the few projects that are considered &quot;important&quot;), is to work around the system, cheat and look for sloppy shortcuts, ask the poor patients for money directly, and how everything crumbles when the one genius/madman that pulled all those tricks to make it work goes out of the picture.",1396796098

7541128,comment,7540590,7541019,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"The example reminds me of a web page presenting the Awesome Unpredictability of Chaotic Systems that left me underwhelmed. You&#x27;d click on a pixel in a flash object and it would start moving in a lemniscatish path defined by some differential equations. The lesson to be drawn was that this system, easy to define, makes it &quot;impossible to predict&quot; the position of the particle at any given time, in the sense that tiny changes in the initial position led to rather wide gaps between the particles at time t=t_1 (maybe two particles released at the same time from adjacent pixels end up across the lemniscate from each other at some later time).<p>The lesson I actually drew was more like so:<p>Hm, if you release a few particles into this system you&#x27;ll quickly notice that they all seem to be traveling along the same rough lemniscate. The lemniscate is a tiny minority of the entire space, so learning the differential equations lets me substantially improve my predictions of where the particle will be at any moment.

I&#x27;m assuming it comes down to what the service providers TOS says, but then doesn&#x27;t every service running on a windows based server need to have you agree to both the windows TOS and their TOS before taking your information (even if you agree to one TOS within another TOS)?

In fact, it makes much more sense than capitalism: trust is built slowly, and enhanced by gifts of land and marriage bonds. It was a major cultural change that allowed people in the early modern economy to put blind faith in faceless institutions and unseen strangers. People living in developed countries often don&#x27;t see how much trust is required to maintain it, and this trust takes ages to build. Children grow up seeing that the &quot;system works&quot; so as adults, they don&#x27;t rock the boat (well, most of them don&#x27;t). To them, rampant bribery and nepotism in developing countries seems strange and illogical, but it is the exact opposite. Those &quot;backwards&quot; systems are built around the idea of cultivating personal relationships because you can&#x27;t trust strangers.<p>The lessons from this is that the converse is also true. A society built around capitalism (and I&#x27;m talking capitalism in general; not necessarily predatory free-market capitalism) requires, first and foremost, a lot of trust in the system. If that trust is lost, we go back to feudalism. There is no such thing as trust-free capitalism (specifically, because without trust there is no credit – which, literally means &quot;faith&quot; – and without credit there is no capitalism).",1396794946

Microsoft have a long and colourful history of doing real damage to open standards, free software, and their own business partners. Even their development community has been harmed by repeated changes of direction in their development efforts – damage which is made worse by that fact that the ecosystem is traditionally so closed. Maybe we are seeing a core of developers who are actually too young to have experienced this firsthand, or at least with limited experience of other platforms, who are a little less skeptical.<p>Anyway, Microsoft&#x27;s recent bout of openness is nothing but a good thing.

Just because your ancestors developed a more complex Rube Goldberg machine for threat response and finding nutrients doesn&#x27;t mean you should diminish those living things less fortunate than you.

Is it any surprise that different living things have different kinds of experiences and ways of &quot;computing&quot; those experiences?<p>Plants have glutamate receptors (analogous to higher organism&#x27;s system for memory formation and learning). Sea Sponges, just like plants, have no neurons at all, but can use various mechanisms for whole body contraction and other intra-cellular communication -- like calcium waves. <i>Radiata</i>, some of the simplest multi-cellular mobile animals, have nervous systems, but some threat responses, like stingers, are wholly automated and disconnected from their nervous systems entirely.<p>You don&#x27;t <i>know</i> if a cow or a pig or a chicken experiences pain. They could just be operating according to an evolutionary pre-programmed instinctual chemical trigger response that you are simply personifying as pain. The reaction of a cow to a threat is not much different than a bacteria to a macrophage.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose an Alien drops to Earth tomorrow. But because of how their species evolved experiences the universe in ways we can&#x27;t even begin to imagine.

Woke up at 4 a.m. with a hypothesis, and built a working prototype before breakfast. What a great day already.<p>I have written over a million lines of commercial code since 1979, still work serving customers pretty much full time and have enough time left for another 20 to 30 hours per week on personal projects. I have at least one or two more start ups in me, for sure.<p>If this industry was like it was when I started, before PCs and the internet, and I had to sling COBOL for enterprises, I&#x27;d probably be a greeter at Walmart now, planning for social security. But fortunately our world has changed and it&#x27;s so much more interesting and fun. If I ever do retire, I&#x27;ll probably still keep building stuff forever.<p>The 2 best things: software is <i>everywhere</i> and involved in <i>everything</i> now. I can&#x27;t imagine not finding an interesting application. And perhaps more importantly, things change so fast, there&#x27;s always something newer and possibly more interesting right around the corner. (I wish I had more time to explore node, go, and some more frameworks, but I&#x27;m so busy...)<p>Between building software, riding my bike, drinking great beer, and getting laid every once in a while, I still feel like 25.

Here in Jakarta lanes are mostly for decorative purposes only, but the roads are shared by cars, trucks, autorickshaws, motorcycles, and various forms of human-powered cards (either pushed by a pedestrian or with a mechanism based on a bicycle).  It is amazingly chaotic.<p>But one of the first things you learn is not only to be pedantic about signalling when turning but that you need to claim space because otherwise you are asking for an accident and if you are involved in one as a car driver, it doesn&#x27;t matter whose fault it is: the motorcyclist/bicyclist loses on the physics and the car driver loses in front of the police (that&#x27;s one way btw that police corruption protects the poor here).<p>The space-claiming is key.  You <i>do not want to be passed</i> on the left while making a left-hand turn (they drive here the same side as in the UK).

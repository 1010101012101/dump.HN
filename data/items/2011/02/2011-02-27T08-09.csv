The trouble is that their jobs involve taking care of people and a significant portion of their personal identity is wrapped up in this. Doctors will work extra unpaid hours ""off the books"" so patients won't suffer, teachers will buy classroom materials with their own money, fire-fighters will still respond to fires, even with inadequate safety gear etc.<p>Bureaucrats are more or less free to make whatever cuts they want in these professions because they know that those on the front lines will quietly mutter ""I will work harder"" and pick up the slack until the stress finally drives them from the profession entirely.<p>I've never once seen an employee of the DMV run out to kinkos and spend their own money because the copier was broken.",1298797175

If it turns out to be terrible, oh well, $4/$7/$10 isn't much money.  I watched Green Hornet, too.  It was bad, but it is not so bad that it will scare me away from the cinema forever... and it cost three times as much as genre fiction for a fraction of the enjoyment.  (Semi-relevant: like many genre fans, my consumption in 2010 was above that of 20 average US households.)",1298797140

Those few that still want to pay must pay much more than they would have before the government started giving it away for free because the market has shrunk so much<p>3) The same thing happens to alternatives to the thing they made free<p>4) Decisions are now made by those delivering the process instead of the person choosing between the alternatives. Costs and benefits are no longer weighed together or by the person that cares about the outcome the most. Considerations easily described in resumes and sound bites become uber important<p>5) The corporations and unions move in and start influencing the decision makers, carving out expensive niches for themselves<p>6) Things that truly matter but aren't profitable for the politically connected fall by the wayside<p>7) People getting something free put up with it because ditching the free thing for same thing done right is now a super expensive alternative<p>8) Delivering the free thing grows more expensive, much faster than the rate of inflation<p>9) Eventually the tax payers fight back and the costs of delivering the thing are slashed, along with quality. The corporations and unions have to spend and/or threaten more to hang on to their protected positions.<p>10) Those getting the service for free now have to spend all their time at rallies and fine tuning the stories about how badly they're being treated.",1298797098

2267544,comment,2266193,2267466,0,0,Derbasti,,,"I think in the US, Amazon is in one special state where taxes are low or something. So they have to ship from there, too. Hence, the mean distances Amazon has to ship to in the US is way longer than in smaller countries.<p>However, USPS is slow even for short distances. I presume it is optimized for mean shipping time of all US destinations instead of minimum shipping time of individual packages. And population density in the US is slightly smaller than in Germany, so shipping is more bound to be slightly less efficient.<p>I guess Canada has a considerably lower population density, so shipping gets more expensive. Maybe the Canadian postal service does not offer fast shipping at attractive prices?",1298796993

2267528,comment,2267203,2267203,0,0,6ren,,,"Disruption has three parts I believe:<p>1. incumbent, customers, and an offering that is high quality along a dimension valued by the customers. The dimension might be: how entertaining, how educational, how clever, how escapist, etc.<p>2. entrant, different customers, and an offering that is <i>crap</i> along the above dimension, but better than nothing for their customers. They can't attract the incument's customers, so they instead attract people who currently have nothing (and to whom ""crap"" is therefore delightful). It serve them, but the incumbent can't, because it is cheaper and/or more convenient/accessible/customizable.<p>3. over time, the entrant improves. The incumbent's customers don't actually want perfection along that dimension, just good enough (like a small meal, you want it bigger, but eventually it's big enough, you are satiated, and you don't want any more). The entrant doesn't need to beat the incumbent; it only needs to be good enough. But it's also cheaper/more convenient etc, so the incumbent's customers switch: disruption.<p>notes: Disruption might not happen, e.g. if the customers aren't satiated; if the entrant can't improve enough. In considering the dimension, it's important to consider not just want the company provides, but what the customer is trying to achieve (benefit, not feature).<p>For indy writer's, the product seems to be clearly inferior. But it's cheaper and more convenient (on a kindle - though many books are too). It seems to have already found an audience who doesn't mind that (who is that audience?). Dedicated, intelligent people get better at whatever they work at; so it's reasonable to assume that these indy writers will improve.<p>Is there any reason to think they won't improve enough to meet the needs of readers of traditional books? One issue is that they have no editor, and an editor can help tremendously. Not just in proof-reading, but also in direction, even plot ideas, character issues - and marketability. It's hard for the one person to be both creator and objective appraiser. But perhaps there could arise a new ""indy editor"" position? Or writers can persuade their spouse to be their editor (osc does this). Or (who knows) crowd source it (webpage?)/mechanical turk it.<p>[EDIT <i>But I cannot edit properly myself. It's just not possible.</i> - <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tonya-plank/meet-mega-bestselling-ind_b_804685.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tonya-plank/meet-mega-bestsell...</a>]<p>But note that <i>it doesn't need to be as good as traditional books</i> - it just needs to be good enough for what the market wants. That's enough to disrupt the incumbent publishers. I will note here that many page-turners that sold very well were decried by critics. It seems almost a truism that popular books are ""trash"" - til the author's dead, anyway. (Though I note that these sometimes are based on savvy market reading - for example,  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardy_Boys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardy_Boys</a>) Therefore, it seems quite plausible that indy writers can eventually become <i>good enough</i> to disrupt traditional publishers.",1298795505

2267525,comment,2266924,2267426,0,0,Mz,,,"Actually, I spent a year at death's door and I agree with Groxx.  Some folks who are sick do not have the ability to do something like this. But lots of them spend time on email lists, trying to give support to others as one of the few useful, gratifying things they are still capable of.  I went back to school (part-time and mostly online) and, while still very ill, began growing some little websites (which originated as emails on some email lists).  Finding something, anything to do to occupy your mind while your body is a hellish prison of endless torment is blessed relief and sometimes the only reason to not commit suicide.  Different people handle it differently, but people who are dying don't typically do stuff like this to be remembered heroically.  They typically do it to still have something of a life in spite of it all.<p>The main text for my class on homelessness and public policy was a book called ""Tell them who I am"" written by a man dying of cancer.  He was already doing volunteer work with a homeless shelter and when it became clear he likely wouldn't live, he decided to do something more satisfying with his life than just keep showing up for his job.  So he quit and spent more time with these homeless women and wrote a book.  It is an amazing book.  But the guy didn't do it to be all heroic.  He did it because he valued the experience more than showing up for work and wanted to grab a little gusto while he still could.<p>Anyway, I upvoted you for all the good it did.

They're even behind #3, Palm/HP. They haven't shipped, and I don't have any idea when they will. I read the tech press pretty much every day, and I have no idea when this is supposed to be. I assume this year?<p>If you're working on a RIM app, I'm asking you: why? I am honestly curious.<p>Edit: I went to rim.com, and after three pages and <i>six</i> clicks (including that funny country selector thing - why do I have to do this again? I don't need to do this when I visit apple.com), I finally got to the ""playbook"" page. But nowhere on that page is any indication of when I'll be able to buy this thing, or any kind of online store that would let me order it. All I can see is ""Get Updates"" which takes me to the form on the bottom of the page where I can tell them how to send me a promotional newsletter. (This makes me glad that I bought an iPad last April. If I had to wait for RIM, the best I could do would be to print out a picture of their product, glue it to a thin book and pretend that I have an iPad.)<p>Edit #2: You know, Palm made a great effort at almost this same thing, <i>actually shippped their product</i>, and they still sank (and they're only relevant now because HP picked up the pieces) for messing up less than this.

7808870,comment,7807991,7808437,1,0,k-mcgrady,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot. I&#x27;ll answer it two ways.<p>Negative:<p>- As we&#x27;ve automated jobs we&#x27;ve also created new ones, but lots of these new jobs are BS. Inspectors of inspectors etc. to fulfil health and safety regulations. We&#x27;re also creating a lot of things that improve our lives or entertain us but are really just created so we have something to spend our money on. We don&#x27;t need them.<p>Positive:<p>- I think the idea of a basic income would fix this. If we can automate everything and reduce the number of people that need to work AND provide them  with a basic income, they can live their lives and not have to work. If you aren&#x27;t anti-government you could even have the government owning factories, producing goods through automation and selling them to other countries in order to finance a good basic income for its citizens.<p>It&#x27;s going to be interesting and if you are young enough likely something you will see played out in your lifetime. Although the changes in the 20th century were massive and world changing I think the changes this century are going to be ones which change how we actually live on lives on a very basic level. What we do everyday and how we get money. Even if it all goes to hell it&#x27;ll be interesting!",1401263573

7808863,comment,7805922,7806167,1,0,sytelus,,,"In statistics, taking average on any distribution is perfectly valid metric that give you an <i>expected value</i> - even on power curve. For example, let&#x27;s say you roll a dice and get a million dollar if you get 6 but nothing otherwise. Then your expected return is $1M divided by 6.<p>I was always interested this number: Sum the personal networth increase of each founder and divide that by number of founder years. That would give <i>expected</i> networth gain per year for being YC founder. Due to outliers, I think it would be significant number and actually makes a case for being YC founder.<p>One another advantage in calculating this number is that you can compare it with other accelerators (provided you have data for large enough number of founders for each). This would be interesting for rank accelerators from founder perspective (as opposed to investor perspective).",1401263324

Manned spacecraft usually orbit at extremely low altitude because they tend to be heavy and the tradeoff of regular reboosts is mostly worth it (manned space stations need regular resupply anyway). However, whereas the orbital lifetime of the ISS may be measured in mere years even just a few hundred km higher increases lifetime to centuries and beyond that to millenia.<p>Here&#x27;s an excellent infographic on orbital debris: <a href=""http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/ArtAndPhoto-Fronts/TECH/Graphics/RT_SPACE-DEBRIS.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/ArtAndPhoto-F...</a><p>You can see that most of the debris below 700 km has naturally been culled by aerodynamic drag, but above that altitude there is still a large amount of debris, most of which has an expected natural lifetime of many centuries.",1401263322

There are also people I know who normally don&#x27;t get motion sickness but get a bit queasy facing the wrong way.<p>2.

I know several cars currently (mostly people carriers) that have rotating seats but they can&#x27;t be rotated when driving.

Contacts your support. You finally figure out that the problem is caused by a system you have no control over. You tell the user a) there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it b) they should prepare for it happening in the future. The user is unhappy. This repeats over and over again.<p>2. Custom sync: A user experiences an issue. You go to your server, find the root cause and fix it. The user is happy, and you also fixed problems for all the other users with the same issue. So this particular situation is never repeated again.<p>I&#x27;ve never said everything in your system had to be custom made. I emphasized, &quot;it depends on what your priorities are&quot;.<p>If you priority is customer experience, then you can take the huge field of syncing, slice off a little manageable portion of it -- that makes sense for your app -- and attack it with elegance.<p>See you don&#x27;t have to do a better iCloud, you just have to do a better slice of the syncing pie. Big difference.<p>Clearly not all developers are suited for this. But in a lot of cases, it is not only possible, but even advisable at the moment. Vesper is a good example.<p>(scenario number (1.) is not just a hypothetical situation you just have to look at the mountains of evidence: lot of apps had to remove iCloud syncing, because of the tons of complaints that flooded their support channels)",1401262579

The only difference is the cost of the driver, so the automated bus might save passengers $5/day. Is that $5/day extra cost keeping this business non-existent at the moment? I&#x27;m a little skeptical.<p>Keep in mind your taxi service is cheap because it&#x27;s on the road all the time. A taxi might make $250/day, and pay the driver half of that cost. That means the company is making $125/day per taxi. You&#x27;re one of 15 or 20 people taking that taxi in a day, so the $15 trip is possible. If everyone was taking an automated car to work, they need to pay the majority of that $125/day price. Split it with 4 people, and that&#x27;s just over $30/day each. Kind of expensive. Add more people and we&#x27;re turning into a bus or public transit again.<p>Work schedules offset would help everything all around. If some people worked 7-3, 8-4, 9-5, 10-6, 11-7, etc, then we could decrease rush hour traffic, and use the cars multiple times to lower the price to $10/day, which starts to become interesting.<p>I like your idea of buying a car, adding it to a network, and getting money back when you&#x27;re not using it.",1401261798

Knowing the opening is more about understanding the position, it&#x27;s strength and weaknesses, the immediate tactics available, and the natural flow of pieces towards their strategical aims.<p>Yes, tactical lines do require more knowledge of concrete lines, because they are complicated to work out over the board. But at that point the memorisation should be a &quot;summary shortcut&quot; of your understanding or assessment of the position.<p>If it were about memorisation, what happens when both players reach the end of their memorised lines? If it&#x27;s not mate, or one player being substantially better off (in which case, why did the other player memorise that line too), how do you proceed from there?<p>And that&#x27;s where knowing an opening comes to the fore, the important part of the opening isn&#x27;t the moves themselves, but how the game opens up to the middle-game. Understanding the types and structure of the middle-game that&#x27;s derived from the opening is a far more valuable investment of time. For instance, knowing how to play with and against an isolated d-pawn - a significant number of opening variations lead to these kind of structures. Hedgehog structures, static double-pawn structures, backward pawns, outposts on an open file.<p>Knowing how to play a position is long term more valuable than memorising a routine of moves. Understanding over rote-repetition.<p>Granted, some positions are predominantly tactical, and those you need to calculate - either at the board, or before hand. Memorisation is a poor substitute for actual experience.<p>One of my proudest over-the-board achievements was understanding how to exploit the positional drawbacks of the Black side of a Stonewall Dutch. And beating a player 600-700 Elo stronger than me because I understood the White knight manoeuvre from f3-e5-d3, before exposing Black&#x27;s backward e6-pawn by opening the centre with the f3 + e4 pawn advances. I spent a week trying to understand one model game of that opening, white&#x27;s plan was logical, and the strategic aim of exposing the backward e6 pawn easy to understand and attempt.",1401261512

Here&#x27;s why: the two most important concepts to understand before you can properly grok DVCS are (a) that your source history is a key integral part of your workflow and not just a sideshow, and (b) how revisions, changesets and merges relate to each other through the DAG. GUI tools do this very effectively by putting your source history, complete with a graphical view of your revisions, right at the front of your workflow. By contrast, the command line requires you to type git log --graph, effectively relegating it to a sideshow like in the bad old days of Subversion.<p>I can&#x27;t help getting the impression that learning DVCS through the command line risks you ending up with an understanding of the subject that is fundamentally flawed.

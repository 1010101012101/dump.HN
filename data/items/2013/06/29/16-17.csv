Several visualizations are shown, typically contrasting Java&#x27;s adoption and job market against that of other popular languages (C / C++ or Python, Ruby, JavaScript - depending on the time period involved).<p>* Take home from the above : Java is not in decline (in adoption and job rankings) relative to other major languages.<p>* A Stack Overflow survey result is presented, showing a weak but statistically significant correlation between Java use and age (slightly older developers being a bit more likely to be familiar with Java)<p>* Java is still being used in major open source initiatives (Hadoop, Lucene, Cassandra, as well as a number of projects released by Netflix). This is presented as a particularly reassuring sign of Java&#x27;s role in the development ecosystem. IMO I agree.<p>Additional points / Java&#x27;s shortcomings :<p>* Java kind of sucks at reducing friction of deployment. Illustrated by comparing PostgreSQL&#x27;s friction of installation to MySQL. The talk refers specifically to things like ease of installation & configuration, but (IMO) the lack of a single, unified, <i>simple</i> package management system is just as lacking in this regard<p>I&#x27;m sure there was more, but I mostly watched the talk in the background.

5962965,comment,5962493,5962493,6,0,jvm,,,"There are two major counterpoints here. The first, which has already been mentioned, is that economists do agree on many things.<p>The second big point is that the profession actually does (mostly) agree on monetary policy when interest rates are comfortably positive. In the mainstream, it&#x27;s widely agreed that when interest rates are positive, a) the fed controls inflation and b) the Taylor rule is a good approximation of what the fed should do.<p>When interest rates hit 0 in 2008-9, the field was thrown in disarray. Roughly, neo-Keynesians like Krugman believe the fed no longer controls inflation (or controls it less well) and so fiscal stimulus is necessary to supplement monetary policy. Neo-monetarists like Sumner believe the Fed continues to control inflation, via QE, so the Fed should just continue to use the Taylor rule but use QE instead of interest rates and basically just pump out money as long as the Taylor rule calls for negative rates, echoing Milton Friedman&#x27;s advice for Japan in the 90&#x27;s (which Krugman agreed with at the time!!).* According to both those views, monetary or fiscal stimulus have been inadequate.<p>Due to the unprecedented nature of QE an opposing camp has strengthened, arguing that the fed&#x27;s actions have been reckless and ineffectual. These have been joined by dissenting voices, such as the Austrian real business cycle theorists which have always been opposed to fed intervention in the money supply.<p>The recent crisis raised new problems that the field has yet to grapple with. But finding good answers is likely to be very important. As events proceed, it will hopefully become obvious which concerns and predictions are warranted. I see the process as a healthy scientific debate, not a reason to throw out the whole field.<p>* To be more technical, they actually call for an abandonment of the Taylor rule and its replacement with NGDP level targeting, but in effect those are actually quite similar. One important motivation is to move away from equating interest rates with monetary policy, since interest rates aren&#x27;t useful at the ZLB.",1372524779

5962948,comment,5962493,5962493,1,0,mbesto,,,"IMO - The underpinning issue with the subject of Economics is that it&#x27;s often misconstrued as a science. A science implies that what you are studying and testing is reproducible (i.e. the scientific method). However the issue with many of the <i>theories</i> of economics is they are subject to change. Let&#x27;s say for example you state a theory that says &quot;If X happens, Y will happen&quot;. Often in economics, once X happens to a certain point (let&#x27;s say everyone catches on to the idea that X will always yield Y, so everyone simply goes and does it), Y may no longer happen at the same rate.

Nevertheless, according to the morals listed in the DoI, the US government is founded on the belief that Russians have these rights, because they are human beings.</i><p>The distinction one must make based on my interpretation is that the US may believe that Russians have those rights, but it is not the US Government&#x27;s responsibility to secure them, especially if doing so would conflict with the objective of securing the rights of its own citizens.<p>The Government&#x27;s first duty is to its citizens, and it&#x27;s the duty of citizens to hold its government accountable.  It is, therefore, not the least bit surprising to see a different reaction between the idea of a government spying on others versus spying on citizens.<p>I also did not bother to question the relevance of bringing in Geneva convention arguments into a discussion about surveillance and privacy.  If you examine carefully, you&#x27;ll discover that the Geneva Convention deals with issues of life, liberty, and happiness quite directly in the sense of execution, imprisonment, and torture.  Privacy, meanwhile, is a right derived from the US Constitution and not one of those alluded to in the Declaration.<p>Nowhere do I say that you can&#x27;t argue that a Government should uphold basic rights of all humans everywhere regardless of citizenship.  What you can&#x27;t do is trot out the first half-phrase of the Declaration of Independence, highlight one example of a legal argument that a non-state entity had flagrantly violated terms of a convention and should not enjoy its benefits, and somehow try to connect that to Americans being really pissed off about being subject to a large surveillance program by their own Government.",1372524042

But if that person was my boss, I would feel much more violated.<p>For an American like myself, domestic spying is scary for the same reason. The US government is my local government. They run our children&#x27;s schools. They make me send in reams of silly tax documents. They make me wait in line at the DMV. They patrol the streets of my neighborhood with guns. When I call 911 (the emergency number), it&#x27;s the US government who answers. In short, the US government -- my government -- is in a great position to abuse the knowledge gained from spying. It&#x27;s this immediacy that heightens fear of domestic spying.<p>Another thing to note is that there is a subtle but important distinction for Americans between the CIA and the FBI. The connotative equivalent of the FBI is the police and the connotative equivalent of the CIA is the army. Thus, watching the CIA spy on Americans feels ominous and sinister. It&#x27;s the spying equivalent of martial law.<p>What Americans don&#x27;t realize, I think, is that for foreigners it is an issue of respect. That is, the underlying context of domestic spying outrage is that US citizens were _not_ outraged by foreign spying; that it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to spy on the foreigners as long as we protect our own privacy.<p>In the end, privacy is about perception.

5962893,comment,5961785,5962498,47,0,4891,,,"Thank you - this is the most sensible comment I&#x27;ve seen in this thread.<p>Many thinkers throughout history have noted that states and criminal gangs are effectively the same. They are both inherently violent organisations. Criminal gangs are tiny states; states are large, settled criminal gangs.<p>The Yakuza in Japan or the Cray family (when they ruled half of London) are examples of intermediate forms: criminal gangs that have taken on some of the role of the state. Rather than arbitrarily robbing people, they instead ask for protection money. This is more than just a polite form of robbery: they legitimately protect you from <i>other criminal gangs</i>. Though I doubt anyone here has had to make the decision, I think everyone would prefer to deal with one predictable criminal gang than many competing unpredictable gangs.<p>Eventually the gang leaders realise that it&#x27;s in their own interest to build a stable, prosperous society: its better to be a Caesar than a barbarian warlord. If nothing else, the wine is nicer. Passing laws and promising that even the leaders will abide by them makes the citizens comfortable dealing with one another and makes everyone richer. Once everyone is comfortable with the idea of the law being supreme, the mob might realise they can do away with kings and bring in constitutions and parliaments and so on. Democracy works (and only works) because the mob agrees that <i>these</i> are the set of rules they will live by, and that therefore it&#x27;s not wise to ignore them.<p>Still, rights and laws remain contingent on power. Human rights only extend as far as the military reach of states that support human rights. Until we build a world government, the only universal law over humanity is the same as it was in 10000 BC: raw power, physical force, violence. The world as a whole is essentially a lawless realm consisting of about 200 gangs; the only thing that stops everything turning into bloods vs crips is a shaky system of alliances, treaties and, ultimately, mutually assured destruction.<p>One obvious counterpoint is that France no longer needs to fear Germany because the Germans and French are suddenly BFFs and neither will vote to go to war with the other. The &quot;international community&quot; is slowly coming to resemble a federated state, with one set of laws. But this community is not truly international. Russia and China can violate your right to privacy all they want. Ultimately, this is because they have H-bombs. Likewise, we can violate Sharia Law as much as we like and Iran can&#x27;t stop us.<p>My point is this: most of these complaints would make sense if America truly was a world government, achieving legitimacy via just consent of the 7 billion governed. But it&#x27;s not, and it can limit its citizenship however it pleases. The fact that America was historically built on immigration doesn&#x27;t give me, a foreigner, the &quot;right&quot; to live there. The very concept is nonsensical - the USG has more guns than me, and so they can decide who&#x27;s in and who&#x27;s out. The idea that people should be able to live wherever they want is a beautiful dream but is entirely counter to the way the world is going, and is also horrendously impractical.<p>I&#x27;ve travelled to China a few times over the last few years and each time the visa requirements have gotten stricter. They&#x27;ve decided they don&#x27;t need any more foreigners, and I can&#x27;t contest the morality of this with the CPC because again, they have more guns than me. As the world gets more crowded, other middle income countries will follow suit. The walls are going up everywhere. As much as I, personally, would benefit from the US tearing down its borders and letting me live there without restriction, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense if they do so and other countries don&#x27;t.<p>Americans can constrain their intelligence agencies and open their borders as much as they like. They can&#x27;t force other countries to do the same, which means that these policy proposals are equivalent to &quot;we should make our intelligence gathering less capable than that of China and Russia&quot; and &quot;we should import Latin Americans until our quality of life is equal to that of Honduras&quot;. If America wants to reenact the fall of Rome, that&#x27;s their prerogative, but as a foreigner I wish other foreigners would not cheerlead them as they do so. No America means no &quot;international community&quot; (what can the EU do against China and Russia?), and good luck petitioning China to respect your human rights as a global citizen.<p>Although you might not believe it, I&#x27;m not actually a cynic about human nature or pessimistic about our future. We built stable, peaceful societies in a violent world. Go humanity! But we have to remember that this was not achieved by the divine intervention of the Great God Human Rights, but by working within the universal laws of power. Good can triumph over evil, but as even Jesus said, it needs the &quot;cunning of snakes&quot; to succeed.",1372523534

There is even a notion of a &quot;secret&quot; list where the cops operating the system aren&#x27;t even aware of what the analysts are looking for. These systems can also do geofencing -- if a plate for a known sex offender is spotted within a certain distance of a school, they&#x27;re busted. Lots of stolen cars have been recovered via ALPR -- and remember most serious crime starts with the criminals obtaining a stolen car.<p>The system can also be used for internal investigations -- for instance there was a cop who was stalking his ex-wife who happened to have an ALPR. They pulled the capture history and her license plate came up multiple times. So he&#x27;s busted.<p>Depending on how the system is set up they could store and back up the images and geolocations forever.

A lot of businesses depend on traffic from google, and if it decides to cut them off, well too bad. Many governments including the US government constantly look into google to prevent a monopoly. You want a monopoly in search? And how about the direction of where your hosted software will go ... when Larry Page took the reins, he decided that Google+ should feature prominently in every product. I agree with him but others may not. And what about killing off Google reader just like that? Do you think people come to rely on these things and then the centralized company can just kill the product?<p>And as for building stuff &quot;in the cloud&quot;, what happens when your AWS availability zone goes down? Lots of big internet sites go down. Centralization on the internet also got us facebook, and when facebook goes down or shuts off a site, &quot;Connect with Facebook&quot; doesn&#x27;t work on that site anymore until they fix it.<p>(responding to your edit) As for the iPad, etc. ... yes, the original platforms are usually proprietary walled gardens, but eventually the tech gets commoditized (sometimes after a protracted software patent fight). Rather than expound on it here, you can read my complete thoughts on multiple app stores and reputations: <a href=""http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=114"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=114</a><p>NOW THE DISCLAIMERS:\nI will admit, that Google is also full of extremely bright people and does awesome stuff with all the money it makes. Self-driving cars, google glasses, and much more. But you are still relying on Google to maintain its data liberation and open technologies, and to some extent their commitment has lessened.<p>Also, Amazon&#x27;s impressive commitment to low margins is a net win for all of us consumers (including the developers). At the scale that Google and Amazon build, a lot of amazing research is possible. That is the upside of centralization. And I am not saying that we should &quot;abolish&quot; centralized services. Especially the ones which are open and have great tools.<p>What I <i>AM</i> saying is that the open source foundations need to step up their game and produce SERVERS that are user friendly and easy to install, maintain and run. This new generation of servers should automatically link together. I really do believe that at the end of the day, history has shown that open PLATFORMS lead to the greatest good for humanity, as everyone can build apps on top of them without favoritism. For example Apple&#x27;s iOS favors twitter and facebook sharing over any other companies, because they made a deal with them. There needs to be competition between the &quot;centralized sector&quot; and the &quot;open source sector&quot;, which will lead to the server software becoming commoditized and more user friendly, just as browsers are today.",1372522142

5962795,comment,5962577,5962577,1,0,mjn,,,"I think one of the tensions underlying this article and responses is a quite longstanding debate over the relative strengths of writing text and interactive editing for specifying and editing computations. Smalltalk was perhaps the first to take a strong position against writing text as the best way to do things, and instead pushed for an interactive system that just happened to have text as one component. A certain style of macro/DSL-oriented Lisp is perhaps the other end of the spectrum, which aims at coming up with expressive code interfaces to a problem (though there are also very interactive approaches to developing Lisp, going all the way to the extreme of image-based development where there actually is no easy way to recover the running image&#x27;s source code). The Lisp impulse (in one flavor of Lisp dev) is to find a way to write a macro as a new interface to common patterns, while the tool approach is to find a way to write refactoring/manipulation/codegen interfaces to deal with common patterns.<p>Maybe some defenders of XML are one extreme in the tool-oriented direction; some explicitly argue that human-editable syntax doesn&#x27;t matter, because concrete syntax is for machines, and how a human should input it is an interface-design question. I&#x27;m tempted to think some C++ advocates also have views along those lines.<p>Anyway I think a lot of these debates are about where exactly on that spectrum constitutes a sweet spot, so point to some fairly deep splits. I personally lean towards wanting expressive source code, and start getting suspicious when I&#x27;m shoveling around huge amounts of boilerplate with an IDE; I start thinking, why is this something I&#x27;m manipulating in an editor, rather than something that gets abstracted by a macro or language feature? But I still use a number of semi-automated things in vim, certainly the low-level stuff like variable-name completion and folding.",1372521899

About the only thing that doesn&#x27;t work, is that you can&#x27;t use the &quot;binding&quot; macro inside of a go macro (but using one outside the macro will work as expected). Go block translation stops at function boundaries, so you can use a for loop inside a go, but since the for returns a lazy seq, putting takes inside the body of a for doesn&#x27;t really make sense (or work), instead, use dotimes or a loop/recur.<p>Aside from that, go blocks do slow down the code they contain a bit. From my tests, this slow down is within 1.5-2x the original code. However since go block shouldn&#x27;t be looping a ton, this shouldn&#x27;t matter.

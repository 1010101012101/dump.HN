If you want to sell a book to me, don't call me an idiot.<p>Yes, I know it's just a joke, but to me, it's a poor, insulting, and, most of all, an idiotic joke. Perhaps the authors think of themselves as idiots. Why should I read them?<p>I'd much rather buy from a ""For smart people"" series. It's a shame no one publishes that.",1218182209

His waiter example was trivial; there's no reason you wouldn't want the marshmallow bowl refilled, but usually programs aren't like that. I hate when programs do stuff without asking me, especially by default. Everytime I start using OpenOffice on somebody else's machine it takes it all of a minute to incorrectly autocorrect something I've typed (I disable autocorrect on my machines). That's the kind of ""silent waiter"" I hate, I don't want it automatically doing something unless there's absolutely no way I wouldn't want it done, and that's fairly rare",1218181540

270354,story,,,7,4,iamdave,"Ask YC: Client Presses Charges (an update)",,"It's now been a week since (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=263646) one of my developers was threatened with legal action from a client regarding a deposit they made for him to put together a site.<p>The client has officially pressed charges after our boy resigned, and decided to move back up north and refocus his life.  Needless to say, internally there's lots of concern and we're deciding to lease out our programmers if someone requests services from them.  Meaning, if our developers end up working for their own client, that client will be billed at our company rate, under company standards and policies to protect such a thing from ever happening again.  In addition to this, the client must meet with me personally and sign an agreement of indemnity which will secure the company if they client is dissatisfied.<p>The last thing we want is to stifle these guy's skills and force them to work on only one thing all the time, even though I know some of you will think it's just a bad idea to let our developers work on outside projects anyway.<p>Regarding our boy, Jim. We're giving him access to our legal resources to combat this, after taking a look at the paper work he initiated the client doesn't appear to have a case and Jim is expected to pull through with flying colors.<p>I posted this primarily as a little alert to new founders and people getting into the game: Keep every little bit of paper work you get, understand the legality behind starting a business, even if it's a simple web shop being developed by someone else.  And for Christ's sake, if you're a business person with no know-how in technology, be prepared to pay the developer you hire more than you think they'll need.<p><i>Any suggestions that you guys want to throw out here, I'm sure Jim will appreciate the encouragement and advice on dealing with the matter.</i>",1218180864

270347,story,,,5,7,lazukars,"HTML Hand Coder with Issues",,"I am hand-coding the HTML for all of the pages for a stealth startup and and having issues with other people altering my code.<p>Pretty much when I complete a new HTML page it is sent to developers in India who eventually put the webpage live.  Once in awhile these India developers will make changes to the code or they will tweak existing pages upon the request of my boss. My boss makes it mandatory that these Indian guys make changes from time to time so I have no control over these guys.<p>The problem lies in the fact that they are using Dreamweaver to make changes on the startupâ€™s webpages, which as a result, screws up all of hand coded HTML and more specifically the layout of the entire page.  The layout is really what is causing most of the problems.  The Indian guys, by using Dreamweaver, change the layout of the page every time they do any minor adjustment in Dreamweaver.  The layout may not change the look of the webpage in the browser, but it does change the CSS.  This in turn screws up the layout of any of my newly added sections that I add from time to time.<p>So my solution, and hopefully some of you can help, is to make a template for every page on the site; a template that can not be altered by these Indian developers.   This way even if these Dreamweaver guys change some code around the template is intact and so is the general layout of the page.<p>Now here is where some of you (I hope) can help.  How do you lock an HTML template, so no one can alter it.  Second, any suggestions are welcome.  Thanks in advance.",1218180051

If we supposedly 'get wise' to inflated asking prices and start haggling down to 30-50% original - they'll just inflate the original.

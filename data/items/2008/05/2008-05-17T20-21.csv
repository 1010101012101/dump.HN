192896,comment,192887,192887,0,0,davidkellis,,,"From the article:
""What we really need is a persistence-aware programming environment""<p>This really hits home with me. I've been working on a data model for one of my projects. I'm trying to model time series data so that I can perform analysis of the data as it changes over time. I've been thinking about how best to model this using the relational model, but even after a few months I've been unable to develop a relational model that I'm happy with.<p>The more I read about MapReduce and similar methods of computation, the more I become convinced that I could model time series data and perform analysis of it with a method of computation that is more ""integrated"" into my data store. Essentially, I'd like to be able to use my programming language of choice (at the moment, that's ruby) to perform queries on my datastore that for one reason or another I've been unable to represent in SQL or a similar query language.",1211055831

192886,comment,192616,192811,0,0,maximilian,,,"So, you know how like Rails runs on Ruby, which is kinda slow.  As you may or may not know, Ruby isn't compiled into any sort of machine code, or even bytecode.  It is compiled down into a tree-representation (like all languages i think), but instead of taking this tree representation into bytecode or native machine code, they just leave it.  This makes ruby extra slow and hard to optimize.  Rubinus (as far as I know) takes the tree and makes bytecode which is then executed on a VM.  This should make it <i>much</i> faster.",1211054661

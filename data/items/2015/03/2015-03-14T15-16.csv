In this sense it is similar to akonadi: there is a threshold after which, if you have a fast connection, it makes dealing with 20GB of email better than using an email client which uses sqlite. In a sense I always felt that while nepomuk and akonadi where plagued with implementation issues, part of the hostility in the KDE community was due to selection bias: people who like KDE in general grok the &quot;hierachical filesystem&quot; metaphor, viz. how kcm is structured. However the random Windows/OSX user (to which a desktop environment like KDE has also to cater, to a certain extent) more often than not has a terrible time organizing files: he creates &quot;dumping ground&quot; folders, and then nest them eight times, or simply puts everything on the desktop and ends up relying on finder for everything.

You then feel pressure to rush through the new features to make up for lost time, causing more bugs to stack up, and... In extreme cases the project reaches a virtual standstill, spending all resources fixing past mistakes. Usually that&#x27;s around the time it gets canceled, no lessons learned, freeing up everyone to do it over on the next project.<p>So, the issue is not one of budget, but of accounting.

First, allow me to say that I spend a lot of time daily reading all kinds of content here, but I don&#x27;t post much, so moderators, please don&#x27;t be too harsh on me if I screwed something up, I hope this post is not against any rules. Thank you for understanding! :)
The reason I&#x27;m writing here is because I&#x27;m searching for a support, for a longer period od time now, teached me there is no better place to find support than in a warm hackernews community.<p>So, my friend and I started our first project on Kickstarter and it&#x27;s about a mobile game we made as a part of our hobbies. I, personally, am not a developer, he did the programming stuff, I helped with graphics and ideas. The game itself is very simple, it&#x27;s played by tapping your finger on the screen which makes jumping character to move forward. The goal of the game is to precisely adjust your timing to avoid touching the worms while moving forward and collect the biggest personal highscore.<p>Here is the link to our Kickstarter project so you can see how it works:<p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1909046409/wormup<p>It&#x27;s not yet available on Google play, unfortunately, because we are still adding some final touches, but we expect to launch it soon.
If you think it has potential, you can support us on Kickstarter, our wishes are very modest: we are asking for 300$ dollars just so we can launch it on App store too, buy music for the game and cover some minor expenses. I know it&#x27;s a funny goal for a Kickstarter project, but we are both university students in a poor economy country, so 300$ is actually a too much of a money for us to pay from our pockets. So, yeah, we really appreciate our backers and you can support us by donating if you like, or just a few words of encouragement here would be great too! :)
Thank you all! :)",1426346295

This desk almost seems to be designed to <i>not</i> allow that to happen, which is counts as a feature rather than a bug to my mind.<p>A nice compromise would be to use butcher-paper that&#x27;s less wide than your desk is deep, leaving perhaps the back third of the desk uncovered.  That way, you can put your various permanent pieces of desk furniture --- pen-pots, charger cables, paper trays, whatever else --- at the back of your desk and still have the front two-thirds as a rolling writing surface.<p>That also probably makes it easier to use 100% of the depth of the writing surface, because reaching right to the back of the desk isn&#x27;t really practical.

This has many, many drawbacks... no type safety, poor performance, frequently requires allocations if you want to store more than sizeof(void<i>), forces the compiler to generate poor code...<p>- Custom data structures for your use-case. In my experience, this is the most common for performance-critical code. Doesn&#x27;t end up being a problem </i>nearly* as often as some people think (e.g., you don&#x27;t spend much time writing data structure code), as you only write the subset for what you actually need at the time (A hash-table is fairly easy if you only need get-or-insert, exists, and clear), and you don&#x27;t tend to need these data structures as much as you might think. This is still not ideal for some applications that require many containers (this is the minority of all applications, in my experience!).<p>- Intrusive containers. This only works in some cases (lists, trees, and chained hash tables), but basically the idea is that you put the shared part of the data structure as a struct at the front (or in the middle if the  implementation does some offsetof math) of your type, and then all the operations use that. This tends to be less than ideal because of both the pointer chasing and storing additional pointers, but it beats the void* approach, and is better than poor implementations of the others, assuming you can do the data structure you want this way.<p>- Writing code that generates the code for the container for each type you need. This isn&#x27;t as common as the other three but you definitely see it. Typically after generating it once it&#x27;s customized but sometimes the ability to edit the generator and re-generate it might take priority.",1426346126

2768396,comment,2767495,2767495,3,0,richardw,,,"Wrong. In Facebook most 'groups' are formed only from the people you know. The 750 million people has zero relationship to how many groups I'll be involved in, so there's a strong upper limit to potential group formation that is nowhere near what Reed's law predicts.<p>I've largely filled up my FB friends and rarely add new members anymore. I'm pretty sure that I'll be adding links (and being added) indefinitely with G+. On G+ I've already had more interesting discussions with people who relate to me in different ways from my real-life friends. These are spontaneous 'groups' that have formed briefly around a post, and from which links have been made that would normally not have been made. I wouldn't friend someone on Facebook just because they said something interesting, but on G+ I might follow them much more easily. There's less of a big deal with having to be 'friends' - you can just subscribe to their posts and might end up in many more discussions with them in future.<p>Think about HN. It's created friendships and careers and companies. If we were all doing this only via our Facebook friends, how much of this would have happened?<p>G+ has more people you'd interact with, more posts to interact with them, more dimensions to add links by. Not just friends, but interest groups, industry leaders, etc etc.",1310752711

2768385,comment,2767176,2767176,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I enjoy the Economist because they cover topics well and will tell you their sources as well. (which both validates that they <i>have</i> sources and you can evaluate the base information they are using for their article). That being said, this particular event, or series of events, will change the European Union profoundly.<p>As with most political enterprises, the EU is a compromise. Much like the original Articles of Confederation [1] it took a very touchy situation (pretty much independent political nation-state entities) and attempted to craft a framework around how they might co-operate politically, financially, and militarily.<p>Early criticism of what was produced was once called 'a bus where every passenger has their own steering wheel' by a Swiss delegate. We can see the literal effects of that as participating countries, have their wheels apparently turned 45 degrees to the direction of travel. If enough countries do that the bus can, and will drive off the road. (ok that's enough torturing of that analogy!)<p>Europe remembers what it was like to be dominated by Germany involuntarily. One of the sub-themes of the original EU discussions had very real tension about effectively handing over the soverignty to the 'big' economic powers (France, Britain, and Germany). So there were a number of checks and balances in the final treaties that provide very real limits on what the EU can do (mostly they left in the ways to 'help' and took out most of the ways to 'discipline'). That compromise may ulitmately be untenable and the events of the next few years will test those compromises to the breaking point.<p>I predict several things will be true <i>after</i> this crisis that are not true now. One, I think there will either be a way for the EU to expell a member or to put it under 'federal' control. Second there will be a trans-EU judiciary system which allows for injecting change (either through impeachment, imprisonment, or both) into member states leadership. If such a system existed it would have allowed the joint-EU leadership to demand (and get) corrective action on destructive behavior.<p>Those changes will effectively mean handing national soverignty over to a central authority. And either the Europeans will be able to swallow that change, or the EU will disintegrate back into independent nations.<p>It may be that they reach a compromise somehow, but my expectations that the EU will survive unchanged are low.<p>[1] <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Articles_of_C...</a>",1310752565

I'd strongly recommend ""Heaven's Command: An Imperial Progress"" by Jan Morris for a piece that looks at all the good <i>and</i> bad that the British Empire did under Victoria.<p>To make a long story really short, the British did ridiculous amounts of good in their colonies.<p>For instance, eliminating the Thugee strangling cult:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuggee#The_practice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuggee#The_practice</a><p>They also ended a lot of cannibalism, human sacrifices, completely ended the worldwide slave trade, eliminated piracy, brought rule of law, built infrastructure, brought science and the scientific method, eliminated cults, ended rituals of widows burning themselves on their husband's funeral pyre, eliminated kidnap/rape/murder cycles in many of their possessions, brought sanitation and education, and... just tons of good. Overwhelming amounts of good.<p>The Empire was lost largely out of a sense of guilt and an unwillingness to take the actions that would have preserved it - pretty much any individual uprising could have been crushed if they'd decided to (including the American Revolution - see Ron Chernow's ""Washington - A Life"" for just how easy it would been for the British to end the whole thing at Boston, New York, or Valley Forge at various times).",1310752476

2768376,story,,,135,78,CCapigami,"Google's Android Market is crippling small development teams",,"I've been a long time lurker on Hacker News. I apologize for the somewhat sensationalist title, but it really is rather true.<p>Out of Milk started off as a dedicated Android project as our attempt to create an application for Android phones that absolutely screamed quality. We looked at the apps currently available on Google's Market and realized that there is a lack of quality applications with dedicated developers. We have spent a lot of money and a lot of time trying to prove that Android is a robust and high-quality platform. Unfortunately, Google is making this extremely difficult.<p>I am a developer / co-founder of one the most popular Shopping List and Productivity applications on the Android Market. Our application is called Out of Milk (https://Market.android.com/details?id=com.capigami.outofmilk).  As of right now, we are currently nearing 1 million downloads, a gigantic install base of users, and over 6000 ratings, nearly all 4-5 stars.  Over the past several weeks, it is almost as if Google is working against the people contributing applications to their Market.  Google is consistently releasing updates to the Market that is consistently and thoroughly making it impossible to be profitable in one of the most aggressive and fast-moving markets on the internet.  I'd like to outline the bevy of issues we have been facing.<p>1) Statistics - Developers get to see statistics for their applications in the Developer Console which are updated regularly (usually on a daily basis).  These statistics include how many downloads you have had, how many users have your application installed, how many ratings you have, and other important metrics for your application.  The stats showing the total number of users who have your app installed will randomly freeze.  For the past month, it's only been updated a few times due to issues with the Developer Console.  At the same time this is happening, your competitors may or may not be experiencing the same issue.  The stats are a factor in your apps ranking on the Market so if your stats stagnate it may give your competitor an unfair edge in the Market.  Once the statistics start working again, they do not work retroactively, it just starts where it originally froze.  The last time it froze for us, 3% of our install base magically disappeared because we got a ton of downloads but no installations over a 2 week period.<p>2) Market Search - This is the big killer.  Before the updates to the Market over the past few weeks, searching for our application by its content type would consistently put us near the top of the results.  I believe that this is correct due to the fact that we are extremely popular and well-reviewed.  However, now when searching in our application category, we are result #227.  We are consistently being beaten by hundreds of application that have 10-50 downloads, zero ratings, and absolutely no Market history.  This has caused our purchases to fall from doing very well to almost getting no purchases at all.  Google's Market updates are effectively making sure that Out of Milk cannot continue development due to not making enough to cover operating costs.<p>3) Comment Sorting - When visiting applications on the Market, the comment ratings consistently display in a very strange manner, almost as if there is no sorting at all. Instead of showing the most recent reviews that may praise us for adding a new feature or condemn us for a bug, it is displaying reviews from the beginning of the year that may or may not be relevant to the application by this point in its lifecycle.  Users who visit the application and read reviews that are extremely out of date do not get a good overview of what this application is about.<p>4) Google Support -  This is a complete joke. I am not even sure why Google is providing support at all.  We contact Google on a regular basis trying to find out about our issues and how we can recover from them.  If Google replies, it usually takes well over 3 days for them to reply with a canned response. After asking as to how we can fix our Market ranking results in the search and for a status update if they are working on it, the reply was, and this is almost an exact quote, ""Google is always working to make the Market even better."".<p>The four issues I have detailed above are game breakers.  How can Google expect developers to get involved in the Market if the success of their application is completely based on the whim of broken updates to their software?  Out of Milk went from doing extremely well to dead in the water almost overnight.  We are working as hard we can to try and figure out solutions from our own end, but Google is the guy driving this bus and we can only do so much on our own.<p>My advice to people who are currently looking to get into developing for Android: wait.  There is absolutely no benefit to spending your time, money and effort on getting involved in the Android Market place at this time. Google is actively working to make sure that you, the developer, cannot and will not succeed in their Market.  That sounds like a bald-faced lie, I know, but it is the only conclusion I can come to in this matter. Visit the support forums for Android Developers and look at the hundreds of threads about these same issues with absolutely zero replies and it all becomes a little clearer.",1310752388

Bird flocks are often a great demonstration of emergent and cooperative behavior in the animal kingdom.<p>As to your point, while I would not assume people are strictly rational its important to understand the transition points where rational behavior becomes destructive for society.  Not because everyone acts in a strictly rational fashion but rather because there is a tendency for the average individual to do so.   for example corruption often links to both the benefit and the risk of being corrupt and enforcement is far more important than what's in the books. IMO, the most important insight is given a large population there are usually several productive approaches that tend to balance over time.<p>PS: If you think about it Sociology and Psychology are considered separate disciplines for obvious reasons.

For an animal to survive it needs to take in at least as many calories as it expends, so evolutionary scientists often explain behavior in terms of expending calories and preserving calories.  E.g, Predators tend to sleep a lot because hunting takes up a lot of calories.  It's better to preserve the calories they gained hunting by sleeping a lot, rather then spend them on another hunt that may or may not be successful.  As opposed to large herbivores that don't gain that many calories from grass, but don't spend so many eating it, either.  They sleep very little because foraging those extra hours turns out to be a caloric win.<p>Our ""ancient"" brain (which is a crappy term, I know) refers to the set of behaviors we evolved to survive in a society pre civilization.  In that environment, effort == calories spent.  What the author is saying is that for evolutionary reasons, we evolved to not want to waste calories (put forth effort) if there isn't a good chance of getting them back.  But, because our food sources no longer in jeopardy, that evolutionary urge which led to our survival in the wild now leads to the vice known as procrastination.",1310751034

Notice that there are close to 60 such messages. If I include blog comments in the search, the number jumps into the hundreds.<p>Deep procrastination is a distressing affliction. Students who suffer from it lose the ability to start school work. Deadlines pass and they hand nothing in. Professors provide special extensions, but the students still cant bring themselves to do the work. And so on.<p>As evidenced by my inbox, this issue is surprisingly common, especially at elite colleges. Yet its also almost entirely off the radar of traditional student counseling, which is why I dedicate time to it here.<p>In my previous post, I introduced a dubious evolutionary explanation for an otherwise very real phenomenon: procrastination, in my experience, is not a character flaw, but instead evidence that you dont have a believable plan for succeeding at what youre trying to do. In this post, as promised, I want to apply this evolutionary perspective to help better understand, and therefore better combat, the deep variety of this common issue.<p>The Question of Why<p>Deep procrastination usually strikes students later in their college career, when the difficulty of their courses ratchets up. At this stage, their work load gets harder and harder, and at some point some powerful part of their brain says no more!<p>An evolutionary perspective on procrastination helps explain this reaction. The student is asking his or her brain to expend lots of energy (from a biological perspective, studying for an orgo exam is an expensive thing to do). One way to see this process is that theres an ancient part of our brain that has evolved to evaluate any such plans  a filter, of sorts, to prevent the wasting of precious energy.<p>Why are we going to expend so much precious energy?, it asks.<p>The more modern, abstract-reasoning, rational part of the students brain is quick to respond: Because we need to expend this energy to pass the test which we need to earn our degree!<p>What the hell is a degree and why do we need one?, the ancient brain counters.<p>Because thats what youre supposed to do, the rational brain responds.<p>And this is where the problem occurs.<p>The rational part of the brain is promoting an abstract societal value. It knows that for a middle class American, earning a college degree is an expected milestone on your path to integration into the middle class economy<p>But the ancient brain doesnt do well with abstract societal values, which are a recent addition to humankind on the scale of evolutionary time. One way to understand deep procrastination, therefore, is as a rejection of an ambiguous, abstract answer to the key question of why youre going through the mental strain required by the college experience.<p>(As in my previous post, Im using an evolutionary explanation metaphorically  as a way to help explain a concrete phenomenon Ive observed in my research and writing on this topic. Whether the evolutionary explanation for the phenomenon is strictly true is somewhat beside the point and beyond my expertise.)<p>The good news is that this understanding provides a clear strategy for combating this scourge: form a more concrete and personal answer to the question of why.<p>Combating Deep Procrastination<p>From my experience, an effective answer to this question of why youre at college can be constructed through the following process:<p>First, devise a (tentative) answer to the following question: What makes a good life good? This is the foundation on which everything else in your life will be built. Your goal is not the identify the right answer, but to instead identify a working hypothesis. This answer will evolve along with your life experience, so this is not a time for perfectionism. If youre religious, your starting point for finding this answer is obvious. If youre not religious, you could jump into philosophy  as this question has been at the core of human thinking since the time of the Greeks  but Ive found its more approachable to start with biographies of people whose life you admire, looking for evidence of their own responses to this prompt.
Second, decide how your experience at college can best be leveraged to support this vision of a good life. If, for example, you decide the key to a good life is to master something useful to the world, this might lead to you to see college as an opportunity to master a hard skill while exposing yourself to examples of people applying this skill in useful ways.
Third, identify the set of specific student tactics that will help you succeed in this leveraging. In our above example, this thinking might lead you to the concrete strategies I espoused in my romantic scholar series.
This process provides a more personal and concrete answer to the fundamental question being posed by your ancient brain.<p>Why should I expend all this difficult energy?, it asks once again.<p>Because its part of a well-thought through plan for leading a good life, you now respond.<p>Sounds good, it agrees while you head to the library.<p>As I noted in an earlier post on this subject, this self-reflection is not an easy process. But college really is a fantastic time to face these basic questions. Deep procrastination, once you understand its source, doesnt have to a Jobian affliction. It can instead be seen as the prompt you need to get your internal shop in order.<p>If youve had success combating deep procrastination with answers to these basic questions, please share your experience. Concrete examples help deep procrastinators commit to a way out.",1310750952

  Ability to collapse comments on a post in the Stream

  Nested Circles would be kinda cool.

  Deeper integration of G+ with Google Calendar, Google Reader, GMail,

  Hashtags

  A quick way to navigate to / view / list all my comments

  Apps support using OpenSocial.

This date suggested that Y chromosome Adam lived tens of thousands of years after his female counterpart Mitochondrial Eve, who lived 150,000-200,000 years ago[8]. This date also meant that Y-chromosome Adam lived at a time very close to, and possibly after, the out of Africa migration which is believed to have taken place 50,000-80,000 years ago.<p>One explanation given for this discrepancy in the dates of Adam and Eve was that females have a better chance of reproducing than males due to the practice of polygyny. When a male individual has several wives, he has effectively prevented other males in the community from reproducing and passing on their y-chromosomes to subsequent generations. On the other hand, polygyny doesn't prevent most females in a community from passing on their mitochondrial DNA to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success of males and females can lead to fewer male lineages relative to female lineages persisting into the future. These fewer male lineages are more sensitive to drift and would most likely coalesce on a more recent common ancestor. This would potentially explain the more recent dates associated with Y-chromosome Adam.[9][10]<p>From: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam</a>",1310749529

It doesn't matter if a person is receiving a ""non-monetary reward"", in the form of a sense of fulfillment, or in satisfaction.<p>If a person chooses to do something which will benefit others, and not themselves, they are acting altruistically.<p>Now, I happen to think that a person can be selfish <i>and</i> still be altruistic, because of the non-monetary rewards you're alluding to. I am self-interested in improving the lives of the people around me, so, although my actions are altruistic, it still benefits me in a sense. But, that's not a very popular way of looking at it; by definition, when people talk about ""benefits"" and ""costs"" associated with altruism, they're talking about things like money or physical health. So, again: if your actions <i>cost you money and benefit others</i>, then you are acting altruistically. I would say that choosing a life of academia fits that rather nicely.<p>By the way, you and I have gone 'round about this subject not all that long ago (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2695906"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2695906</a>).

Either method involves making first contact, and nothing starts without some form of communication with the company you're interested in.  The issue isn't throwing resumes at every company with no plan, the issue is actually getting to speak to someone at the company who knows what they're hiring for and is willing to talk to you about it.  I don't think this article covers that first step (and nothing can be done without that initial contact).",1310749244

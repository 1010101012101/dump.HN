2312854,comment,2309317,2309779,0,0,sp4rki,,,"It doesn't have to be miserable at all. If your profits doubled this year and some employees are the reason for such an increase, then you would be a jerk to play hardball with said employees about salary increases. Now if your company took a negative hit and an employee that doesn't really create a decent amount of value asks for a raise, then he's a jerk for not having the company's best interest in mind (and if his performance is not good enough you should be thinking about letting him go anyways).<p>Hell the whole point of working is to advance in the world. You as an employer should be making more money with each year that passes in comparison to past years. Employees as people with goals and dreams should be making more money as time passes also. If you're making more money thanks to your employees, your employees should be making more money also. Not just because they're entitled to it, but because there's always the possibility that by letting them go could end up costing you more money than a raise of a couple of thousand dollars.<p>A great team is something you should strive to maintain and cherish, but is also something that becomes exponentially more expensive as years pass. If they're working like a well oiled machine and creating insane amounts of value for your company, just pay up. If by comparison they're average (or worse) and your company isn't growing one bit because of lack of innovation or performance on their part, then you're correct in playing hardball... while you look for replacements that can actually benefit your company.",1299837511

Is it because he's rich and he can afford it? No, it's because this is who he is. He wasn't born rich; he got where he is because he could never ever produce garbage. A simple way to prove this is to consider: if he had shipped garbage through out his career, why would he stop now?

But a host of evidence strongly suggest they <i>do</i> manipulate you.<p>There's doing better this year (lessons learned etc), and doing less than optimal now so you can do better next year.  If I recall correctly, Apple did that once with the IPhone: the case had room for a camera that wasn't there in this year's model.<p>On a different note, there is better and there is different.  The design of cars, for instance, changes much faster than the underlying mechanics (engine, safety…) improve.  As far as I can tell, Apple isn't too guilty of this.  Their design though exquisitely shiny, is relatively stable.<p>There's also the timing of product: most goods now are designed <i>not</i> to last (designers actually learn at school how important this is for their future customers).  The most famous example is light bulbs.  They only last 1500 to 2000 hours because the biggest vendors at the time colluded to limit their lifetimes.  They got sued, but since, despite numerous patents for long-lasting light bulbs, you don't find any for sale.  Apple used this strategy once with irreplaceable IPods' batteries.  They eventually backed off because a consumer union sued them.<p>Going back to the IPad, if Apple really cared about making the best product possible, they would have made the processor replaceable, and the memory extend-able, so that when they inevitably improve, customer can replace them at lower cost (both in money and in resources).<p>Now, I'm not willing to blame Evil Corp™ right away: they just maximize profit.  So, I'd rather ask what in our society generates such profit maximizers.",1299837285

He certainly doesn't make huge donations or contributions to many non-profits, but does his work impact millions of people and drive innovation greatly? Yes. Even if its not the kind of work that solves problems relating to global warming or poverty, it has it's own kind of impact. Does all that work vastly help improve technology as well as the quality of life in some way? I think most would agree that the answer is a definite hell yes regardless of what they think the definition of the word social entrepreneur is.<p>I may not be doing something like Sal Khan with the Khan Academy or anything like Bill Gates with his foundation, so in that sense I'm not a social entrepreneur, but I'd like to believe that what I am doing (or trying to do) does have impact in people's lives and help make some people's lives better albeit not to the extent of Steve Jobs or the greater social good. I don't believe I'm just aiming at some profit number and blindly ignoring my fellow man either. I think that solving a problem and making someone's life better is still a social impact, albeit not in the way people would think of a social entrepreneur, but that's fine by me.<p>That said, I view the definition of what constitutes an ""entrepreneur"" does not matter whether they are doing something noble or not. An entrepreneur to me is anyone taking the risk to run their own business. That is the general definition in the vaguest (is that even a word?) sense. A startup entrepreneur or a social entrepreneur are specific types of entrepreneurs. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course this is all personal opinion.",1299835957

Those that are available haven't really been a fit.<p>2. Going through my network of friends have been tough. Everyone is looking to hire people so they're all looking to hire people themselves. If they do have friends who are available for recommendation, these guys are either happy where they are or if they do leave, would want to do their own thing.<p>3. Listing jobs on craigslist and job boards for the most part have returns lots of resumes but few that really meet the requirements (I personally feel not many coders are as good as they think they are or they lack chemistry in other areas beyond their coding ability).<p>I've talked to a lot of people lately and it seems everyone is having a hard time finding quality talent to hire. For those that have had great successes in hiring talent, what worked best for you?<p>PS I have a solid idea, traction, technical myself, and profitability so those things are not an issue in attracting talent.

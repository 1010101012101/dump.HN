Lots of it.<p>The user side is simple:  As the user base grows your infrastructure requirements grow as well.  And, at certain milestones these needs grow in large capex bursts.  Flexible services such as AWS have made scaling far cheaper, more linear and less expensive, but it it still very expensive once you cross certain business-dependent thresholds.  Hardware is hardware, whether you own it or not.<p>Of course, the team will scale based on other parameters.  More engineers, more designers, customer service, accounting, operations, whatever.  More people.  Not working for peanuts of feel good hippie thoughts but for money.  They need it to live, rent or buy a place to live, feed themselves and their families, save, invest, have fun, etc.<p>Given that internet culture quickly --from the very early days-- levitated to free and add-supported free most internet users only want to pay for their connectivity.  Nobody wants to pay for anything on the internet.  That&#x27;s just a fact.  Pick any service, say LinkeIn, far more free users than paid users.  It&#x27;s like that across the board.<p>Hell, it&#x27;s even like that in mobile.  Unless you get lucky it&#x27;s nearly impossible to make money with paid apps.  Make them free and then sell them something from within the app or support it with ads.<p>I stand by my original sentiment:  The internet would collapse tomorrow if advertising was banned.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I prefer it that way.  I am simply reflecting reality.",1372118279

Perhaps even better, hand them out for free to neighbours that can plug them in as well.<p>Linksys WRT54G from 2004-2005 used to be $60-70, and powerful enough to be flashed with better firmware.

However, I like smaller cities, commuting exclusively by bicycle, having an enormous garden, eating locally grown food, easy access to amazing outdoor adventures, and mild winters.

Ninety nine people out of 100 never have a great answer to the question, &quot;Where do you want to be in 10 years?&quot; Instead, they treat their careers in ad hoc fashion, hopping opportunistically from job to job.<p>The best way to succeed is to have a very clear answer to that cheesy question. Such a clear answer that you&#x27;re almost burned by its intensity. Such a clear answer that it guides your every move. This clarity of vision will allow you to weather temporary failures and setbacks, and it&#x27;ll provide you a roadmap for the climb up the mountain.<p>This is what separates the brilliant-and-hard-working from the brilliant-and-hard-working-and-uber-successful. The world is full of brilliant, hard working people who never get a &quot;lucky break.&quot; The secret is that the &quot;lucky break&quot; is often the result of many years of <i>directed</i> effort. So keep that in mind as you go along. If you want to achieve tremendous success in any field, there&#x27;s a buildup period of at least 5 years, and often more than a decade. It really pays to pick your path early, and to stick to it.<p>Obviously, some folks have taken more circuitous paths to success, and that&#x27;s totally cool.

Democracy in an industrialized world is no trivial task.<p><i>Basically, I can&#x27;t know everything about everything. At some point, I have to trust others.</i><p>Yes, of course.

I&#x27;ve seen doctors do shit (to others) that made me not EVER trust one blindly. I am usually lucky with mine, but I do pay attention to them, I do second-guess them, I measure up their character, how peaceful and concentrated they are, versus just loud and constantly on the move, etc. At the end of the day, nobody but my own immune system, family and friends <i>truly</i> care about my well-being, to the point they&#x27;d loose sleep over it.",1372117701

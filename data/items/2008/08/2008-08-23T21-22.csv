The developers were aware of the problem but seemed to be having problems fixing it. I highly recommend Taboo however, it's a similar plugin I found later that also has an excellent mechanism for showing all the pages in your queue: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5756"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5756</a>",1219528490

  * Very expressive, short easy to read programs that are very composable and easy to refactor.

  * Faster than other interpreted languages except for some or most LISPs.</code></pre>",1219528409

Suppose one person says something mean to another person (MySpace Fiasco) or someone gets too addicted to the game (EverQuest / WOW), I don't want to get personally sued (and in this current time, people sue each other for trivial reasons) -- so it's about protection.",1219528176
284833,comment,284205,284336,0,0,gamble,,,"I agree with your assessment. Having a brand-name degree does open doors - particularly if you're a graduating CS student in competition with thousands of other candidates for the small pool of 'interesting' software jobs. Right or wrong, landing that first job at Google (say) rather than Blubcorp has a significant influence on what positions are available to you down the road. It may not mean you'll make more money, but the work will be more intellectually rewarding.",1219527964
284832,comment,284682,284682,0,0,mdasen,,,"My thoughts:<p>Django has, for a long time, operated as a small-ish community.  When you're a small community, people generally know what's going on just because they hear things and there's a lot of trust in each other.  As projects get larger, you often need a more formal structure.<p>For example, Django has been slow to release and has even recommended that you run off SVN.  That's great when you're an involved person who knows what's going on, but less fun for a casual user of the framework.  Django is getting more casual users.<p>That's great too, but sometimes it requires organizational change.  Django hasn't been (and probably will never be) the boisterously-led community that Rails is.  It isn't the personality of its leaders.  That said, I think we're going to see a lot more communication happening.  For some people, Django has dropped the ball here, but the 1.0 plan definitely cleared a lot of things up and I hope we similarly create a 1.1 plan over the coming months to provide a neat roadmap for developers).<p>In terms of the framework moving forward, I think the 1.0 release will fix a lot of complaints that people have had.  One of the problems with the ""run-off-svn"" mentality is that you're very cautious about putting in big changes.  However, with the run-up to 1.0, we've seen qsrf, newforms-admin, geodjango, etc. all merged.  I think the 1.0 stable release will give us the opportunity to get through a lot of the other patches on SVN as people use 1.0 in production.<p>Every community stumbles, we can always do better, and Django is moving forward and post-1.0 is a great time to start changes.  As a developer with a post-1.0 item in queue, I'm excited.  Yes, it's frustrating when you've contributed a patch just to see it wait in queue.  Hopefully version stability will change that.",1219527812

284816,comment,284657,284696,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Momentum is strong in any major corporation.  Google still has Exchange running for their people who refuse to use GMail (and for BlackBerry users).  It's not just presentations...even at Google, a lot of people are afraid of new technology and continue to use whatever it is that they're accustomed to.  And that makes sense, in many cases...if it takes a day to understand a new product well enough to use it to the same level you used the old product, you've just lost a day of productivity.  Everybody does the math on the additional value that product provides them differently.  Maybe for some, data portability is not a big enough benefit to overcome the lack of flashy slideshows, existing PPT templates they may have been refining for years, and the time it takes to figure things out.",1219525475

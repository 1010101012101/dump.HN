You can't please everyone all the time and I wouldn't expect anyone to start taking advice on how to make a post more relevant to me personally. I would simply find another blog that fits my interests. There are plenty. You know the audience and you did a good job of engaging them. Your writing style is great too. You totally captured the 37Signals voice while still making it your own.<p>Now, what I was talking about is a pattern I see where posts from particular sources end up here very frequently. When I see that happen I start to wonder if they're here because they truly are great articles or just because they came from a particular source with a lot of clout. There's nothing wrong with this in and of itself, it just makes me wonder if we're starting to give particular sources a free pass, allowing them to ride the wave of their previous successes without really evaluating if the latest article truly is worthy of so much recognition. For me, the test would be to put the same article on an unknown blog and see if people still feel the same way about it.<p>Please know, that there's nothing about the content or style of your post that I object to at all. My mind just goes off in that direction after seeing any source on the front page very frequently in a short period of time. And you're right that this on the front page because the majority found it appealing. We have a great community here and I trust them to choose what's good. I want to thank you for posting this comment here because it forced me to be honest with myself and ask, ""what made me react so negatively/too critically to this post being here?"" and while the reason I mentioned earlier is still true I have to admit that there are two less than desirable traits or attitudes that I let slip out.<p>The first was plain old jealousy. The ""I wish I was successful and cool like 37Signals"" type jealousy. The second was negativity for negativity's sake. It was like I just had to go against the grain here for the sake of going against the grain. I'm also in a bad mood today which doesn't help. I think I have to admit I was partly just being petty and that's not cool. Rather than delete my previous comment I'll just man up and admit I was letting my inner asshole/troll slip out and maybe others will be able to learn from me and catch themselves when theirs slip out. Anyway, it wasn't a bad post at all and I'm surprised you even took the time to respond to this unwarranted negativity.",1328558367

It's probably cool for someone looking over your shoulder and wanting to take control of your computer.  But for sitting at the computer and making something happen... I don't think the usability needs to be 'equal'.  And in the desktop world it should <i>favor</i> the keyboard/mouse.<p>Here's an anecdote for touch vs. mouse/keyboard:<p>Pretty sure I'm not - nor is my family setup - typical of a windows user.  We have two touchscreen desktops in our house.<p>I have a two year old that can work the touchscreen very proficiently.  My 5 & 7 year old stick with the mouse and never use the touch, I almost never use touch, and my wife rarely uses it.<p>Based on my personal observations, <i>on the desktop</i>, touch is good for very new users or those who lack the physical coordination to control the mouse and keyboard.  Otherwise, mouse and keyboard wins.<p>The Windows 8 mouse experience is really lacking at the moment. I expect that gets a major update in the next version.",1328557822

I've got 6 hard drives, and I couldn't manage to get SMART warnings to stop popping up because one of them had 6 reallocated sectors. Like, every 3 minutes SMART was screaming at me.<p>Then I was trying to install Amahi and it required a package that was different than one that was installed by default. I could not figure out how to get yum to replace the current package with the one my software needed. The help from the developers? ""--force is never a good option, so we don't offer it"". Thank you, Microsoft, for protecting me from myself. I uninstalled the package, and it automatically uninstalled Network Manager and everything related to DHCP/networking. After that, I couldn't install the package I wanted because I couldn't configure a network connection.<p>It really seems the only time I have to resort to using the command line is when the distro's ""intelligence"" breaks the GUI. Ubuntu doesn't <i>not</i> break things, but at least when it does I know the best recourse (since I partition /home on it's own drive) is to just reinstall. Wouldn't have fixed a thing in Fedora.<p>I grew up on a command line, and I really hate being forced to go back to that just because the developers don't care enough make the GUI work properly.",1328557680

The recent TechCrunch article over Honeywell and Nest really got me worried. Not because its a big corp attempting to kill innovation, but because its killing my innovation.
I work for a small startup that does commercial HVAC optimization. We keep a strong eye on the Nest because, simply, they've got the resources to handle any and all the issues that come with HVAC optimization. Our development team is 4 people compared to their dozens.

Check out the site to get more info on what the product is and try it out for free. It is built with ruby on rails, JS, Chef, MySql, AWS, Rspec, etc.<p>Where we are - I recently left my very well-paying salary job to work on Teamly with my co-founder. We are now both working on Teamly full time. We have an up and running product, good traction (very active users), paying customers (freemium model), and a ton of user feedback. We are close to a small angel round of funding and are in talks with a few accelerators. We are now focusing on our data + user feedback (we have tons of feedback) to really improve the product.<p>Who we are - Matt Berman (me, growth hacker) and Scott Allison (hustler) are the two current co-founders. My background is mostly in user acquisition and coding but I have experience with business as well. I've worked at large corporations and startups alike. Scott has had 3 previous successful businesses and is the most dedicated hustler I've ever met. He is technical in terms of knowledge but doesn't code.<p>Who we are looking for - We are looking for our 3rd and final co-founder to round out our skill set. We are definitely looking for another hacker to join us. This is not a ""small equity"" type position, we are looking for a true co-founder. Expertise with Rails is a must since Teamly is built on Rails. The three main qualities we are looking for in a co-founder are: expertise/knowledge of our stack, passion/dedication to startups and our space, and resourcefulness (aka scrappiness). We are looking for someone who is in the Bay Area as well.<p>We believe we are on to something special and are currently at an exciting point for our startup. If you are interested in learning more, we'd love to hear from you!<p>Matt & Scott

I don't mean smart thermostats, but in accessible premium home technology (as you can tell, their name is more general than thermostats).<p>There are many areas of technology in the home that are controlled by very old companies that are in markets that are very slow to innovate.  The real proof of this is in these patents (q.v.), which detail seemingly near-archaic technology.  Seriously, this is their state of the art?  These are exactly the kind of competitors you want to have.<p>That is a byproduct of the fact that brands and design for home technology last a long, long time.  Recently, I replaced my gas water heater valve and discovered that it's a part that's been around since the 1950's in its current design.  Proven technology sticks around.  Similarly, Honeywell has been in thermostats since forever.<p>Finally, the margins in this business can be pretty impressive.  There are home appliances and technology products whose premium versions cost twice as much as the regular version even though they're not much different.  Some people are just willing to spend a good bit more for the absolute best.  Very much an Apple market strategy (i.e. high-capacity iPods).<p>I hope to see Nest introduce more devices like their learning thermostat soon, as well as a new way for them to communicate and be controlled which can hopefully improve on and replace the ancient X10 automation standard.

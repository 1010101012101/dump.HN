You must get your own domain, with your own email address. You don&#x27;t have to host your domain (web etc) anywhere if you don&#x27;t want, just have your registrar set your mail records to wherever you happen to have your email served.<p>There&#x27;s no way around this one if you want to leave gmail <i>and</i> not be tied to whoever the replacement is. You could go for a yahoo address, or your ISP, but you see where that eventually goes. You need your own domain.<p>Do a little research, it doesn&#x27;t have to cost much, and you can transfer your domain between registrars later if you want.<p>Just don&#x27;t use godaddy.<p>You should think carefully about your domain name, and the address within that domain that you choose for your permanent-ish address, because you only want to send out one more &quot;I&#x27;ve changed my address&quot; messages to your contacts. But once you&#x27;ve done that you&#x27;ll never have to again.<p>2. Once you have your own domain you can host your own email on your own server or VPS if you want, but it&#x27;s not necessary and most people shouldn&#x27;t bother with it.<p>You can even use gmail, but with your own domain and address; I&#x27;ve done that for a time. But you want to <i>leave</i> gmail, so I&#x27;m only pointing this out to make the larger point: once you have your own domain you can have your email sent and received (almost) anywhere.<p>2.1 You can set up gmail to forward to your new domain, so you don&#x27;t miss anything an you don&#x27;t have to log in to gmail. At your new destination you can set things up so that anything forwarded from gmail lands in a gmail folder, so you know who you missed in your &quot;changing my address&quot; message.<p>As time goes by and your people get it right, you&#x27;ll have less and less traffic going through gmail. I still have my gmail account forward to me, years after leaving, but I don&#x27;t think I get anything beyond a few per year anymore. Everyone knows me by my domain, as it should be.<p>Another poster here says not to have gmail forward, but I don&#x27;t know why. Maybe he&#x27;ll update that.<p>2.2 Even if you don&#x27;t use gmail at all, ever again, gmail will still store 25 to 50% of all your email (or some similar sized chunk), because 1/4 to half your correspondents still use gmail.<p>3. Don&#x27;t be averse to paying for email, it brings a little sanity and transparency to the relationship. If you&#x27;re a paying customer then you&#x27;re the <i>customer</i>, not the product, to invoke a tired but true phrase.<p>Valuable and excellent service <i>should</i> cost money. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be a lot.<p>I think I pay around $40 per year for my fastmail account, they have cheaper, and there are other good solutions too. (See the last section below.)<p>3.1 Whoever you go with will almost certainly offer web access. Many people think that that&#x27;s what email <i>is</i>. The look and feel of their web interface might influence your decision as to who to use.<p>Nevertheless, best if you find a provider that offers IMAP access in addition.<p>N. Other than your domain name and address, you don&#x27;t have to get any of this right the first time. You can change registrars without too much hassle, and you can change email providers on a whim if you have your own domain. And yes, you can of course change your domain and/or address later if you must, but try to get that one right, as it&#x27;s the only part of the equation that is <i>you</i>.<p>N.1 See also:<p><a href=\"http://www.emaildiscussions.com/showthread.php?t=64118\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.emaildiscussions.com/showthread.php?t=64118</a><p><a href=\"https://kkinder.com/2013/05/21/leaving-googles-silo-alternatives-to-gmail-talk-calendar-and-more/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kkinder.com/2013/05/21/leaving-googles-silo-alternat...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/</a>",1387342505

Hence proposals like css-regions (see comment below) -- which <i>are</i> about layout. It&#x27;s a common mistake: We came to html (with our designer hats on), and thought: Oh, we can layout text with tables! We were wrong, and we got css -- and we thought: Oh, we can layout text with CSS -- but we were still wrong. We could do some minor (and as it turned out pretty major) styling with CSS -- but it was never really meant for layout. We do need a system for layout, and perhaps the most sane thing to do these days is to wrap CSS into a tool that does styling <i>and</i> layout. But CSS of today isn&#x27;t quite there.<p>See: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-css1-951117.html#abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-css1-951117.html#abstract</a><p>&quot;This document specifies level 1 of the Cascading Style Sheet machanism (CSS1). CSS1 is a simple style sheet language that allows <i>authors and readers</i> to <i>influence</i> the <i>presentation</i> of <i>HTML documents</i>. E.g., a publisher can <i>suggest</i> font families, colors and layout for a document, while the reader can ask for the document to be magnified. By attaching style to HTML elements, document structure and device-independence is preserved.&quot;<p>Over-eager use of emphasis mine.

6925952,comment,6922954,6923637,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> As all data increasingly goes digital, it is wrong for our society to present a conflict of interest: either keep my data myself, and lose out on modern technology; or use modern technology and be subject to omnipresent surveillance.<p>This is a false dichotomy regardless of the state of fourth amendment jurisprudence. There is no inherent reason why you have to store all of your data on Google&#x27;s servers rather than having your own storage device(s) just as you didn&#x27;t need to keep your papers in your associate&#x27;s office a hundred years ago. \bThere is no insurmountable technical reason why your data can&#x27;t be stored and processed locally.<p>The problem is really economic. The problem is that you are about to buy a television and it won&#x27;t change your life one bit whether the television is made by Samsung or LG, whereas that decision of yours will change Samsung&#x27;s bottom line to the tune of a couple hundred bucks. Which means that Samsung et al are willing to pay more to influence your purchasing decision than you are willing to pay for e.g. email service, and allowing them to doesn&#x27;t cost you anything. Which means that it&#x27;s more profitable to offer &quot;free&quot; ad-supported email (and document hosting and blogging etc. etc.) than it is to sell you a product that allows you to seamlessly operate the service using your own hardware. That&#x27;s the problem -- economics. The fact that the economic value of invading privacy in order to target advertising exceeds the value of not having it invaded for that purpose.<p>But once you have a system designed to allow surveillance for the purpose of targeting advertising, which most people have no significant objections to, you get every organization and government lining up who wants to do surveillance for purposes people <i>do</i> strongly object to, and the infrastructure to do it is already in place. So now there&#x27;s trouble: Either you have exclude from government surveillance the data shared with corporations for targeting advertising, which governments don&#x27;t like, or you have customers withdrawing that information from the advertisers in order to keep it from being exposed to government surveillance, which cloud companies and advertisers don&#x27;t like.<p>Somebody is going to be unhappy. And there&#x27;s a good chance that it will be the cloud companies -- even if the US government relents and announces that it&#x27;s going to discontinue SIGINT operations against Americans without a warrant, there is very little chance that they&#x27;ll actually stop against foreign citizens (though they may claim to officially), and even less chance that China and non-state actors (i.e. organized crime) will refrain from doing something similar. Which means that the cost in privacy is no longer just privacy against targeted advertising, it&#x27;s also privacy against surveillance by governments and criminals.<p>On the plus side, new market demand for data hosting products without third party central servers.",1387341746

I think he&#x27;s unlikely to ever write an article that states that the NSA is doing something beneficial to national interests - it won&#x27;t bring in nearly as many readers as a story on overzealous infringing of privacy, and it could potentially call into question his previous reporting.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you can&#x27;t have reporting that&#x27;s both balanced and worth reading.  I&#x27;ve found some of the NY Times&#x27; reporting on the NSA to be fairly interesting.  In particular, &quot;No Morsel Too Miniscule for Consuming NSA&quot;[1], despite the sensational title, was fairly balanced; definitely not propaganda, but at the same time not falling into the trap of saying &quot;the NSA is likely watching you, your friends and your family 24/7&quot;.  They go on for 7 pages describing the NSA&#x27;s problems and successes, inefficiencies, bureaucracy, etc.  They manage to ask the reader to call into question privacy issues and ask whether we&#x27;re getting our tax dollar&#x27;s worth in terms of foreign intelligence delivered - and they managed to do it without whipping their readers into fear-driven frenzy.  It astounds me that two different news agencies can look at the documents that Snowden leaked and get such different interpretations.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/world/no-morsel-too-minuscule-for-all-consuming-nsa.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/world/no-morsel-too-minusc...</a>",1387341454

On the macro level because they stand to lose money. But I’m pretty sure that the picture will be very different when looking at the micro level. I’m pretty sure that when you look at the people leading the charge for these companies you will find many who feel passionately about this and always have been. It’s just that now there is both enough political capital inside the company to actually start lobbying and the revelations have also put pressure on the government, so moving the status quo got (even if only ever so slightly) easier.<p>Many people you will hear speak for these companies will actually feel passionately about this.

The demand for labor is pretty low. Blaming the few companies that are hiring workers isn&#x27;t fair, and forcing them to raise wages doesn&#x27;t fix the problem.<p>>The second problem is that your analogy is imperfect, because it switches round to the demand side rather than the supply side.<p>I think that people thinking of supply and demand sides separately is where a lot of people get confused, especially when discussing labor markets. There really isn&#x27;t any difference and the same economic principles apply to both sides.<p>>companies (often, and in the case we are talking about) don&#x27;t <i>need</i> your labour, they will simply be less productive without it, but you do <i>need</i> a wage, or you will starve to death.<p>Another good point and what I am trying to get at. The problem I think is that people depend on the value of their labor for their income. That&#x27;s hardly fair to begin with (some people are simply worth more economically than others), but it&#x27;s especially problematic if some people&#x27;s labor becomes almost worthless due to automation or whatever.

Someone might invest a great amount of time and effort on encryption, but then look past the fact that the encryption is only as strong as the password that protects it...or that the password is only as secure as the place it is stored (lastpass, 1password, or even your brain).<p>There are many creative ways to circumvent encryption, and one of those ways could be something sinister like a wrench-torture, but it could also be through social engineering or psychological craft.

The most common personal science is health self-measurement, which has recently become much more popular. This article describes 14examples of personal science involving health. The topics include blood sugar, sleep,mood, body weight, resistance to infection, and brain function. Most of the examples areabout new ways to improve these measures. For example, the results suggest that: 1.Skipping breakfast reduces early awakening. 2. Looking at faces in the morningimproves mood. 3. Flaxseed oil improves balance. 4. Butter improves arithmetic speed.Overall, the results suggest that personal science plus expert advice can produce betterhealth than expert advice alone. Personal science may influence statistics in two ways: 1.A new audience. Personal scientists want to learn statistics. 2. Better understanding.Learning about personal science may help statisticians understand science in general</i>&quot;<p><a href=\"http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-...</a><p>---\n---<p>Seth Roberts:&quot;The unreasonable effectiveness of my self-experimentation&quot;<p><i>&quot;Over 12years, my self-experimentation found new and useful ways to improve sleep, mood, health, and weight. Why did it work so well? First, my position was unusual. I had the subject-matter knowledge of an insider, the freedom of an outsider, and the motivation of a person with the problem. I did not need to publish regularly. I did not want to display status via my research. Second, I used a powerful tool. Self-experimentation about the brain can test ideas much more easily (by a factor of about 500,000) than conventional research about other parts of the body. When you gather data, you sample from a power-law-like distribution of progress. Most data helps a little; a tiny fraction of data helps a lot. My subject-matter knowledge and methodological skills (e.g., in data analysis) improved the distribution from which I sampled (i.e., increased the average amount of progress per sample). Self-experimentation allowed me to sample from it much more often than conventional research.

6925816,comment,6922954,6924190,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Is there precedent for a party to put up a different choice in the primary when there&#x27;s a reigning incumbent?<p>The parties elect their candidates in a primary before putting them on the ballot in the general election. But parties don&#x27;t like primaries: You have two of your own candidates saying bad things about each other in public, taking specific stances necessary to win a primary that may be disadvantageous in the general election, and using campaign money that could otherwise have been used against the other party in the general election.<p>So the result is that if the incumbent wants to run again, generally no one from the same party will be willing to mount a primary challenge, and anyone who does will raise the ire of other party members for causing trouble and wasting money. Hence the absurdly high incumbency rate.",1387339294

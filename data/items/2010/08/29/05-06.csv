I could address this specific point, but I just feel it's irrelevant in light of the much bigger issues. I think that this clip is quite insightful to the prevailing attitude in Britain and much of Europe:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E7wgFcCefE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E7wgFcCefE</a><p>At 3:06, Jimmy Carr says ""I'd very much like to say something hilarious, but something must be done."" Take note of his tone - it's not the indignation usually aimed at America. There's no sense that he thinks you should know better. It's the same tone he would use to talk about a humanitarian disaster in the developing world. He's just sad. We're describing ""slavery by the backdoor"" and we're not even angry.<p>We don't view you as ""the evil empire"", not any more. We don't hate you, we just don't have the heart to. We pity you. We pity what you have become and what you may yet become. You look to many of us like a punched-out former heavyweight - once great, now just an incoherent wreck, old and infirm before your time.<p>When hurricane Katrina hit, many of us agreed with Kanye West's sentiment that ""George Bush does not care about black people"". Five years on, many of us have come to believe that the US is just becoming incapable of managing its own affairs. I'm not sure which is a sadder thing to believe.<p>Us Brits can empathise to an extent - we used to have an empire on which the sun never set, now we're just a drizzly little island with a few rotten banks and a rubbish football team. Where we can't empathise is that we've always been able to feed our poor and sick and old. Since 1948 we've had a right to a hospital bed, regardless of our means. We used to think that you were unwilling, but now we're not sure whether you're just unable.<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704913304575370950363737746.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704...</a>",1283061441

The ""system"" really does seem to try.<p><i>""or really the tech industry at all.""</i><p>....aaaaand, No.  You've just grossly over-generalized.<p>The tech industry is clearly unappealing to women.  Maybe that's because women like to have a sense of the humanity of their work.  Maybe it's because it's a terrible choice of long-term career.  Maybe it's Barbie's fault.  But just because you can't identify the reason, doesn't mean that the phenomenon doesn't exist.<p>Instead of observing that your freshman courses were hideously gender-unbalanced and then stopping the intellectual pursuit, you <i>have</i> to dig deeper.  It's a hard problem, but even hard problems have an explanation.  I can come up with one consistent pattern without even trying:  most women don't like working with anti-social losers.  And like it or not, our industry is filled with 'em.<p>Personally, I had about the same number of women in my CS101 course (back in the mid-90s) as you did, but the difference is, I saw them <i>treated like shit</i> -- usually by guys who didn't have a clue that the way they behaved was boorish and offensive.  Those guys also liked to believe that the gender inequality in CS was ""just the way things are"".  Nonsense.<p>More recently (just a couple of years ago), I had a female friend who became really interested in CS, and enrolled in the 101 courses at a top program.  Because of the way the courses were structured, she was a brand-new programmer, competing with guys who had been writing code since they were knee-high.  Doesn't matter -- she still kicked their asses; she was one of the top students in the class.  But she ultimately <i>dropped out</i> of the program because she felt unwelcome, and felt that the barriers she had to overcome were too high.  Every day, I was treated to a new story of how some dude ignored her opinions, stared at her chest, or belittled her in front of her peers.  It was infuriating.<p>To this day -- from classroom to coffeehouse -- I see programmers who treat women like another species.  Just today, I watched a guy write code, while taking a break every two minutes to check out a nearby girl's ""attributes"".  It isn't cute, it isn't endearing, and you can damn well bet that this kind of stuff plays a role in why women decide that they don't want to work with us -- even before they get to school.  And it's our fault.",1283061236

Could men be doing more to change that perception, I think so. So whenever somebody complains about the problem men like Mike Arrigton should not lash out but instead they should just list all the things they do to encourage more female participation. Then the people that complain about the problem can actually point at the proactive steps people are  taking to address the problem and tell them these things are working and those things are not. It's silly to tell women to put up or shut up because it's a lot like telling somebody if you don't like the country then leave.",1283060995

1643216,comment,1641827,1642568,0,0,siglesias,,,"It's too bad you feel this way, because whether you like it or not, most (if not all) of the great intellectuals of the 19th and 20th centuries--Einstein, Wittgenstein, Planck, and (why not?) Jobs--saw a critical role in music as providing some kind of aesthetic guidelines for their work. Bach's music, for example, is contrapuntally rigorous to the extent that fairly complex matrix mathematics are required to explain his patters in crafting The Art of Fugue. Mozart's music Einstein described as ""perfect,"" as if ""plucked from nowhere,"" containing a grace that he was convinced existed in the mathematical formulations describing the cosmos. Believe it or not our logical convictions and ""faith"" in science do have deep-seeded atoms of intuition that nearly identically match the visceral responses we have to music.<p>That's not to mention the fact that music ostensibly IS intertwined with our language and culture, so it would be almost impossible to relate to other people (or understand them, communicate with them, as is the project of numerous scientific fields) if we didn't share their practices. You'd be left in a very strange position of describing an ""objective"" reality devoid of the emotions that make humanness--and by extension, the world--what it is.<p>I recommend you engage in a deeper reading of science and objectivity, because nary will you find a thinker or scientist whose findings, motivations, or thought processes are completely uniformed by a particular set of aesthetic considerations.

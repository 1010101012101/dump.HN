A defense lawyer in this video advised not to talk to police at all if you are being investigated; you could misspeak (esp. under stress), be misunderstood, be taken out of context, the officer could misremember, etc. I have no idea if he&#x27;s a crank or if it&#x27;s good advice:

I enjoy high-quality audio, so I made the effort to do some research and spent decent money on a good sound card and two high-end headphones. End of story; it&#x27;s unlikely that I&#x27;ll need a replacement for those things for a decade. Thankfully there are <i>tons</i> of good products in the area and it makes little sense to sweat it once you&#x27;re found a dozen good choices.<p>As far as furniture goes; it really depends on how obsessive you are on design and interior decoration. There&#x27;s a healthy compromise to strike between utility, cost, and aesthetics, and my experience is that once you have a solid idea for your interior decoration (which is not easy, mind you) you&#x27;re probably good to go; minor blemished and defects should not detract from your satisfaction.<p>In kitchenware, solid and cheap is a good combination. Apart from knives, the most important thing is build quality, but a cheap cast-iron pan is good as long as you&#x27;re not burning stuff.",1415685487

I&#x27;m not sure why.<p>I read your basic point as, &quot;Sure, we all like to use incentives to encourage good behavior, but there are some special cases where incentives completely backfire. In general, feedback systems arise in public services, especially where funding is correlated with or necessary for performance.<p>e.g., If a middle of the road school starts to falter, you don&#x27;t strip away all its funding and expect it to start churning out well rounded prodigies. No, you have to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work of figuring out, &quot;ok, what broke down? Is this a morale issue, something with leadership/management, is the cohort of students a bad outlier, did materials quality decline?&quot; Recovery might take more funds, not less.<p>Other public services would see similar results. A struggling fire department shouldn&#x27;t lose its trucks. A police department that can&#x27;t effectively deter or arrest criminals needs a little more work than just being driven into bankruptcy.<p>To panic&#x27;s point, maybe there are other ways to incentivize good behavior.

The traffic moving at 70 mph (which is 5 mph over the legal limit) or the car that merges into that traffic at 40 mph?<p>All, one-up that one.  How about someone merging into a 60 to 70 mph highway flow at 40 mph with three cars behind him that also need to merge and are now stuck behind someone creating an incredibly dangerous situation because they are (conjecture) afraid of the accelerator.  I have see potentially horrific situations just like the one I described on the California 5 freeway.  This is a major trucking route which is full of 18 wheelers.  They, of course, keep to the right-most lanes.  I saw a woman (sorry ladies, it was a woman) merge onto the freeway at what had to be 35 mph and get right in front of a semi doing at least 60.  Right behind her two cars who were just stuck there desperately trying to figure out how not to get killed by this semi that had to lock all its breaks.<p>Nah, give me someone with years of experience (not a teenager) driving fast any time.  They are generally much safer drivers than the fools who are afraid of going over the posted speed limit.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting on the freeway behind someone who&#x27;s got the pedal to the metal and knows how to match traffic speed and merge safely.",1415684503

[1] It contains five links to the words gesture, quitting, discovery, piggy, and eager, set in Helvetica.<p>To produce the iOS 8 version, I opened the page in Safari on iOS 8.1 pinched zoomed to the maximum amount while keeping all five links within the frame, and took a screenshot.<p>To produce the SmartUnderline version, I visited the SmartUnderline install page [2] in Google Chrome on Mac OS X, entered the test page URL, and clicked “Preview in a separate window”. With the screenshot from my iPhone opened next to the browser, I used Command+[+/-] to zoom the browser until the font sizes were the same size, then took a screenshot.<p>Here are the results: [3].<p>To summarize, I believe iOS 8 has some advantages and some disadvantages, but to me there is no clear winner.<p>Some specific points in no particular order:<p>- iOS underline breaks are always vertical cuts. Since SmartUnderline uses text-shadow to “white-out” the underline, the cut-outs are in the shape of the glyph. To me, this looks better in the “g” in “eager”, but worse in the “q” in “quitting”.<p>- iOS 8 shows a line between a “g” and ”y” (as in ”piggy”) and SmartUnderline does not.<p>- SmartUnderline’s underline extends less far to the left of the first letter and right of the last letter. This looks better in “quitting” and potentially worse in ”discovery”.<p>- In general, SmartUnderline sets a little more space around each descender.<p>- Both implementations show no underline before or after a leading or trailing “g”.<p>- Both implementations show the underline very close to the left side of the “y” descender. I think improvements could be made here with both implementations.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/adamschwartz/hyyerbq4/show/light/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/adamschwartz/hyyerbq4/show/light/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://eager.io/app/eA9ULux0UOJP/install"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eager.io/app/eA9ULux0UOJP/install</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://postimg.org/image/nf9b2ahd1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postimg.org/image/nf9b2ahd1/</a> (@2x <a href=""http://postimg.org/image/688ricy2v/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postimg.org/image/688ricy2v/</a>)",1415684390

Instead of renting a few VM&#x27;s on say Digital Ocean or Amazon and spending probably $50 a month, my co-worker spent at least 50-100 hours of time to put everything on Docker and Puppet.<p>Let&#x27;s say the net cost of that orchestration was around $10,000 in terms of billable time.

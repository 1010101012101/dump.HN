172736,comment,172617,172617,0,0,schammy,,,"A lot of ad networks suck big time. AdSense is decent if your site is content oriented, e.g. articles about specific thigns or whatever. If you run a service like I do however (getclicky.com) then these types of ad networks don't work at all. Plus AdSense seems to be real anal and your account can get canned at any time without explanation and no chance of getting it back. Wow, that's fun.<p>A lot of ad networks also have a 30-90 day pay delay which sucks when you're just getting started.<p>If you have a decent amount of traffic, say at least 2,000 daily visiors or 20,000 daily page views, you should be able to sell ads directly without any problem. You set your own price and cut out the middle man and swim in the money.<p>However the problem with this is that you have to deal with inquiries all the time, worry about billing (unless you have an automated billing system setup already for something else that you can integrate ads into as well). So this service came along called BuySellAds.com that we now use on getclicky.com for our ads. We still set the price and decide how many ads we want to sell, what size, etc. And they deal with all teh billing and take a 25% cut. I think that's reasonable for the automation they provide. Before we switched to them I was dealing with advertising billing and inquiries for many hours every month. They also allow you to cash out at any time. Because of this I highly recommend the service.",1209062878

172733,comment,172513,172670,0,0,LPTS,,,"Some people will claim that psychedelics improve creativity.  I am one of them.  But psychedelics improve creativity by giving people synesthesia, providing years worth of very clear detached associative thinking in hours, and by cleaning out the crud in your psychology so psychological defense mechanisms don't stop you from seeing clearly.  I think psilocybin is a better choice for using psychedelics for creativity than LSD, because psilocybin lasts half as long, and so the experience is less likely to be stressful.<p>Pot changes the perception of time and space, which changes the perception of music, for the better.  As Bill Hicks says, if you don't think drugs have done good things, take all your CD's and burn them.<p>With heroin and successful artists, I think a different type of thing is going on.  I think  people who are highly sensitive are both better artists, and also more likely to carry around pain and to be aware of the pain around them.  They are drawn to heroin because they carry more of the pain around them, and they are good artists because they are highly sensitive.  Some people experience vivid musical hallucinations while on opiates, but one has to be predisposed to it.  The composer Berlioz used a lot of opium remedies for tooth pain, for example, and much of his music is influenced by musical hallucinations while on opiates.  Or, the seventies.<p>Lest I sound too much like some Timothy Leary hack, let me also say drugs can only enhance your creativity if they do not become such a big part of your life that you act on the ideas you have.  Let me also say that creativity requires no drugs.  It's perfectly doable to be maximally creative and not use any drugs.",1209062725

172731,comment,172617,172617,0,0,ROFISH,,,"Just as my own personal anecdote, I've found that CPC AdSense style ads are near worthless, at least on non-targeted sites. I've had ads on the forums of my medium-sized site (<a href=""http://starmen.net/forum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://starmen.net/forum/</a>) and not received very much money.<p>The AdSense ads a lot of times don't even make sense. If you look today, there's a lot of ads about termites, which really is only visible in the title since a goofy server administrator changes the title to a random movie quote every once in awhile. Originally there was a lot of ads for 'mothers', but that's only because it's a website dedicated to the MOTHER video game series.<p>Of course I'm in the unholy combination of 14-25 year old technically-savvy viewers who pay no attention to advertising at all, whether by willful ignorance or intentional AdBlock. It's why Facebook can't generate any cash: Anybody below the age of 25 does not click on ads at all.",1209062670

172710,comment,172529,172529,0,0,marvin,,,"I have personally spent a good deal of effort trying to find out how to create convincing, counterfeit currency. I am reasonably sure that I have the major points nailed down: you have to create your own paper (preferably after chemical and visual analysis of the banknotes in question) and then get hold of some ferromagnetic and fluorescent inkjet inks. Intaglio plates and watermarks can probably be created through a photolitographic process. Color-changing inks are the most tricky part..they obviously use some application of interference, but I haven't quite figured it out. Holograms, for the currencies that require it, can be created with an incredibly expensive hologram machine, which is probably impractical.<p>You'd be surprised at how little of this information is available to the public; most of the information I've gathered I've had to figure out by myself from looking at the officially available information on the security features of paper money. A more paranoid individual would suspect a cover-up. Perhaps there are laws against discussing things like this.<p>If someone has ever read a good book on the history of counterfeit money, I would be glad to hear it. To me it seems as if there is an information desert on this subject - which just sparks my curiosity furher. Counterfeiting is a fascinating engineering discipline, even more so in regions where the economic loss is handled by vast entities (counterfeit money, if not discovered, is paid for through the resulting inflation, counterfeit gold, if done properly, would end up at the balance sheet of a central bank and hence the taxpayers of the country in question, etc.)",1209061456

There are other ways of doing it, but economics and practicality needs to be considered. It is probably easier to build a badass particle accelerator than a nuclear reactor. I am reasonably sure that most modern accelerator laboratories have done this experiment, but it is probably not economical with today's accelerators.

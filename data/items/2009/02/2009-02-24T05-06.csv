492715,comment,492245,492613,0,0,jskopek,,,"They're still valuable, only not in a advertising-driven model. As a platform though, it has a ton of value; when the majority of a company's employees are connected on a system they use personally on a daily basis, there's a lot of potential. When an entire city is connected, you open the door to interaction that haven't been possible until now.<p>Facebook could replace dating, restaurant review, business productivity, classified sites, and expand into things we haven't thought of yet, but that requires a substantial user base. The company is still growing out of its college foundation, but judging by its growing acceptance among the 25+ age group, it could start gaining value fast.",1235455018
492714,comment,492450,492559,0,0,mrtron,,,"Tapes went well beyond what you are giving them credit for - the mixtape scene in rap pre-released compilations of hits and were massively popular.  Many artists claim they went the equivalent of platinum on mixtapes in NY alone.  The distribution chains were also quite complex and well defined.  However - it also served as a method for new artists to gain exposure so artists would actually leak their own material to good DJ's, sometimes even paying them to use their material.  So it was a symbiotic relationship, like downloading music is.<p>It wasn't just teenage kids recording the radio.

But using torrents the 'wrong' way?<p>File sharing is legal in Sweden, which is why they have been able to operate for this long in a very transparent way (in terms of who runs the massive site).<p>Downloading music/movies is legal for personal use for me in Canada.  Annoyingly, we pay a tax, but that is a whole other can of worms.<p>Why would the Pirate Bay remove torrents by request?  They are doing nothing wrong.  The MPAA/RIAA's course of action should have been to try and track down and sue individual downloaders in the US.  The reason they aren't keen on that anymore is the bad publicity of suing regular folks and especially children.<p>I also really dislike the term 'wrong' here because it is not clear that it is wrong to copy a file.  Downloads can lead to higher sales through exposure, and to me the rampant litigation to fight change (as demonstrated by the cartoon) is wrong.",1235454641

It's hard to read (text is sideways), vacuous (""Drink in the spirit of the morning""), and the juice pictured looks sickly and pale.  The most readable text, and hence the part my eye is drawn to, reads ""Some Pulp"".  At best, it looks like a weak imitation of a high-end store brand.<p>I'm left with two questions:<p>First, why would Tropicana choose to change their existing strong brand to this, rather than launching this as a side-brand under a new name and testing the market?  To my limited knowledge, there are probably the strongest brand in orange juice in the US.  I don't see why they would take this risk.<p>Second, it sounds like many people here and elsewhere actively like the new look.  Others, such as me, do not.  I have to presume that I'm in the minority, otherwise the consumer resistance would have turned up during Tropicana's user testing.  Any ideas on why what underlies the divide between the presumed majority who like the new design and the curmedgeonly minority such as myself?",1235454613

492689,comment,492673,492680,0,0,rms,,,"Well, it depends. You should be careful, but then what's the worst that can happen? I had a rather bizarre experience with a first time angel investor, who invested the money and then decided he didn't want to spend the time being an angel investor and basically wrote us off as a loss and didn't want to talk about our business. But the money was real and I wouldn't expect my scenario to ever happen to anyone else.<p>Is the investor bringing anything to the table besides money? You'll want to ensure your investor is mature enough to understand basic things like he is making a loan/investment to your company and that you aren't personally liable for it. Make sure he is an accredited investor. Tell him to go to Angelconf! <a href=""http://www.angelconf.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelconf.org/</a> Hell, maybe you could go with him.<p>In this economy, if you aren't in the Valley you may be waiting a very long time for smart money. So is it normally looked down on here to take non-smart money? Yes. But if you're not a company coming out of YC that is juggling angel investors to find the one that is the best fit, sometimes you have to take what you can get.<p>Are you planning applying to YC or any of the incubators? That would be another reason to wait.",1235452732

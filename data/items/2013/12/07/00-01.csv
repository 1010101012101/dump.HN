6864878,comment,6861654,6862981,1,0,sdesol,,,"The only thing that I got out of it was, if you are using GitHub, why not use it to manage your DNS. This type of service would be interesting to me since I do need to create a lot of short term sub domains but I wasn&#x27;t sold.  This is my current workflow:<p>- User requests a free trial for my product<p>- I spin up a private VPS for them.<p>- I create a temp subdomain so the user can access the newly created VPS.  I use Amazon Route 53 and their command line tool dnscurl.pl to create a new DNS record set.<p>- I keep an eye on the VPS and after an hour, I&#x27;ll destroy the VPS and remove the temp subdomain with Amazon&#x27;s dnscurl.pl<p>All of this is automated and adding/removing DNS records takes seconds and I pay about a buck a month.  The only thing that I find annoying about working with Amazon S5 is you have to use XML files and they do not support IPV6. I would rather use JSON to manage my domains but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s $50/month nice.<p>I also have concerns about introducing a layer in front my DNS management.  GitHub is not available from time to time and I&#x27;d hate to have this be another thing to worry about.  Maybe I&#x27;m not the type of customer you (Namecast) are looking for, but I can see how this would benefit novices.  From their point of view, they&#x27;ll just have to know how to edit a file and do a git push to GitHub.",1386377967

If this knew what my insurance company had negotiated for the procedure, and I could input my policy details to figure out what my personal cost would be then I can totally see the usefulness. But as a consumer I just have no idea at all what knowing the Medicare reimbursement prices tells me.<p>If I assume that the relative differences that Medicare has negotiated are similar to the relative differences my insurance company has negotiated (which I&#x27;m guessing is an invalid assumption), and if I accurately know what my policy will cover vs not cover (again, a nearly impossible thing to know given how complicated these things are), then maybe you can make a decision with this data.

Some hospitals have higher fixed costs or salaries depending on the geography. Also, if a hospital is more research-oriented, R&D funds are normally tacked onto the price (one of the reasons why Stanford&#x27;s Hospital is really expensive).<p>It&#x27;s hard to find quantifiable data on the breakdown of bills, but based on a great article in Time a few months ago, prices are almost entirely arbitrarily defined: <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/08/an-end-to-medical-billing-secrecy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/08/an-end-to-medical-billi...</a>",1386377659

All of the &#x27;raw language&#x27; niceties that Geoffrey mentioned in the article are true, but for me one of the greatest things in Elixir is processes.  Just, the way the Erlang system operates is so well thought out, I&#x27;m more impressed every time I learn something new.<p>Shameless self-promotion here - I run <a href=\"http://www.elixirsips.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.elixirsips.com</a>, which is a screencast series that releases 2 new episodes per week covering some topic in Elixir.  I started it out as I started learning Elixir, and I&#x27;ve been going for quite a while now (I&#x27;m on Episode 33 next, so 16 weeks so far).  It&#x27;s the most fun I&#x27;ve had with a programming language since I first saw Ruby, and I think the BEAM VM is the future (as is Rust/Go/clojure&#x27;s core.async, other concurrency-oriented programming models, etc).<p>So yeah, Elixir&#x27;s amazing and everyone should play with it.  I think just looking at these items mentioned in the article aren&#x27;t even giving it a fair shake - learn about Erlang&#x27;s concurrency and distribution models, or else you aren&#x27;t even scratching the surface :)",1386377630

If it&#x27;s a principle that &quot;everybody&quot; has a copy of the block chain, and the block chain records every transaction ever, isn&#x27;t that going to be a storage problem? How big is one person&#x27;s copy of the block chain now, and how many petabytes might it grow to be in a few years?<p>2. The way to spend a fractional coin is to have one input and two outputs, one back to yourself with the unspent change. But doesn&#x27;t one&#x27;s wallet begin to be cluttered with lots and lots of little fractional items? Like having a pocketful of small coins...

6864850,comment,6864360,6864360,2,0,amark,,,"This article is severely flawed.<p>1. He&#x27;s confounding &quot;The Internet&quot; with electronics in general. He mentions how most days he spent time listening to an e-book or playing video games. The problem is lack of human connection, emotion, and socializing, the internet is just one piece of that puzzle. Playing video games for 2 hours straight is just as bad as surfing reddit for 2 hours.<p>2. He&#x27;s clearly an introvert, and his natural tendency is to avoid human interaction and involve himself in solitary pursuits. Introverts aren&#x27;t always happy about their lack of human interaction, but it&#x27;s their natural state. The internet is just an enabler of his aloneness, much as videogames, or e-books, or even regular books are.<p>3. He talks about losing track of friends. He is the only one culpable for that, nobody else. When we have facebook, it enables us to passively keep up with friends, but in a superficial way. To maintain a real friendship, we must still be active, with our without tools like facebook.<p>4. He complains that traditional communication is just as time consuming as things like email. However, he&#x27;s receiving snail mail in excessive quantities because he&#x27;s a writer, which is not indicative of the average person. Hes not charging his phone, which is his fault. And the fact that he&#x27;s afraid to call anyone is, again, a symptom of him being an introvert. Email, texting, and commenting ARE excessively time consuming.<p>The problem is not the internet, the problem is the fact that we all waste ALOT of time spewing content, forming superficial relationships, and encouraging superficial online communication.<p>The solutions are things like time management. Attitude. Action. The internet, and technology by extension, enables wonderful things, but it also enables the worst of us. It&#x27;s up to the individual to make the best of it.",1386377502

6864772,comment,6862277,6864460,10,0,WildUtah,,,"There are so many conclusive arguments against software patents that the result is overdetermined. Nevertheless, lining the pockets of the patent bar is likely to overcome any quality of argument as long as computer programmers have even less Washington influence than illegal alien terrorists.<p>I&#x27;ll give a few arguments, but first let&#x27;s consider yours. Black boxes are never patentable. The concept of patents is that you reveal exactly how your process works and you get a limited monopoly on the totally new and non-obvious bits of your process for the public benefit. It always matters how the process works inside. That&#x27;s the theory anyway; the patent bar loves to rob the public by cheating the bargain.<p>1. Computer programmers are overwhelmingly against software patents. For the first time in my life I see educated people advocating the abolition of the entire patent system, even at the cost of life saving drugs, just to get patents out of computer software (John Siracusa, to cite a public personality, but there are many, many more who agree). Programmers hate patents in their industry by something like ten or twenty to one.<p>2. Software patents are harmful to innovation. They created almost all the modern patent trolling crisis. They shutdown startups and innovative projects and block open source. They promote vendor lock-in and empower giants over small companies with new ideas.<p>3. Software is math and both math and mental processes are SCOTUS identified ineligible subject matter.<p>4. The quality of software patents we see is uniformly bad. None of Apple&#x27;s, Motorola&#x27;s, Oracle&#x27;s, Samsung&#x27;s, or Microsoft&#x27;s recent patents in litigation or threats thereof have contributed anything to the public. The billion dollar patents from Eolas and NTP were pure garbage. None of the troll patents we hear about all the time ever contributed anything to our art or even constitute inventions at all. Bilsky, Ultramercial, and Alice are all ludicrously abusive. Whole teams of programmers could work for decades searching without finding a single plausibly valid and useful patent in their field.<p>5. When we bought our computers, ever since the first general purpose computers in the 1940s, we have done so expecting to run programs on them. Using a machine for its expected and customary use is not subject to any patents beyond the patents on the machine itself. Running any program at all is the expected use of a computer, at least for programmers who write their own programs, so any program running on a computer is automatically in the prior art. In fact, we already have a list of every program our computers are expected to run and it includes every program any computer can run. We haven&#x27;t printed the list out (not enough paper), but we know exactly how to produce any part of the list for your pleasure on demand.<p>Now the patent bar wants to tell us that programs we expected to run, that are the conventional use of our machines, and that have been on our list since the 1940s are their brilliant inventions and they are going to prohibit us from running them.

But lets look at it from a couple of different perspectives before we conclude they won&#x27;t like that.<p>First we&#x27;ll assume that the Series A is much larger than the BOOST redemption cost, anywhere from about 10x to 20x. We make that assumption because it the BOOST aka &quot;seed&quot; round is much bigger than that the Series A looks more like a Series B than a Series A, which is to say the company valuation isn&#x27;t really in a place where VCs would jump in ok?<p>Lets put some numbers down which makes talking about it easier.<p>Lets say the Series A really is 9X the BOOST so in a post money valuation with 60 percent for the company founders/employees we&#x27;re looking at a cap table that is<p><pre><code>                  versus\n    60% employee          60% Employee\n    36% VC                40% VC\n     4% BOOST              0% BOOST\n</code></pre>\nSo in the left scenario everyone stays in, and in the right hand scenario the Series A investor has effectively &quot;bought out&quot; the BOOST investor. (the money flow is different but the effect is the same). Lets assume that value post money was $5M.<p>Company value increases 5x and the company is sold for $25M.<p>Series A guy in the left scenario gets their liquidation preference + 36% of the remains (with participation) whereas in the right scenario they get their liquidation preference + 40% of the remains (again with participation) in the second scenario.<p>If the company is going to do well (and they assume it will) they do better by <i>not</i> having the BOOST guys in the cap table then they do with them there taking a percentage. If the company does poorly they still lose their same investment they would have lost anyway.<p>Things are simpler for the BOOST guy too, instead of managing dozens of small share holdings in small companies they get a smaller but faster return. This creates a reliable source of seed money for the ideas, which creates a larger pool of potential Series A investments for VC companies.",1386375936

But precision isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> required, because it is a huge mistake to think that investors use precision.<p>It&#x27;s possible to think that they do, and that they make a choice based on adding up the dollar-value of alternatives, multiplying each by its probability, and summing the results.<p>If that were the case then two things would be true (among many others):<p><pre><code>  ----------------------------\n</code></pre>\nI<p>First:<p>Debt that can be repaid would greatly increase the chances of a landed investment (investment being made in response to pitches), since there are many, many cases in which a small group of people formed into a company can repay an early debt, even if the company ultimately folds. All these cases would detract from the down-side. This would, in theory, tip the investment in the favor of being made. For example, if a company has a story that you might make 15x your money in 2 years, but you believe there is a 1 in 15 chance of this happening, then it should objectively make a big difference whether (or how many) out of the other 14 chances repay your money. If all 15 repay your debt, and 1 in 15 makes 15x, then that&#x27;s a good investment, slightly beating the alternative places you could park your money. On the other hand if most of the cases end up losing 100% of your investment, that &quot;should&quot; make the investment quite a bit worse. For example if 14 in 15 lose the investmnet and the fifteenth makes 10x in 3 years, then that is not great.<p>But htis is not how investors actually make their decisions.<p>No investor will give a seed that has a 8 in 10 chance of being repaid (as debt). Period. They just don&#x27;t.<p>Firstly, they are looking for that big, big win. And secondly, they want to skew the probability distribution toward that win.<p>An investor far prefers: (package 1)<p><pre><code>  0.0125 probability of massive, huge, breakaway hit: 500x\n  0.05 probability of HUGE growth: 50x\n  0.9375 probability of total loss (goes to 0 in 3-7 yrs)\n  ------\n  0.0125 * 500 + 0.05 * 50 = 8.75x average.\n</code></pre>\nMeaning: if you invest in 67 companies you will get one 500x growth story to woo your next set of LP&#x27;s with. (1/0.0125 = 67), 1 in 20 of your companies will at least show a 50x growth story, roughly paying for the rest which silently go away within 10 years. If you have a $500M fund you can make 1250 seed-stage investments of $500K. Hopefully you can invest enough Googles with them.<p>to: (package 2)<p><pre><code>  0.05 probabibility of total write-off\n  0.15 probability of small win (e.g. 10% p.a., i.e. debt repaid)\n  0.459 probability of &quot;failed&quot; i.e. moderate growth (5x)\n  0.34 probability of successful growth (20x)\n  0.001 probability of 500x\n  -----------\n  0.15 * 1.1 + 0.459  * 5 + 0.34* 20 + 0.001 * 500 = 9.76.\n</code></pre>\nEven though the first sums to an expected value of less than the second one.<p>Investors aren&#x27;t trying to go for the second package - i.e. making a shot at a very sure 20x and maybe missing it and making 5x. That&#x27;s not what they make seeds into, $2.5M companies they can believe in at $125K (20x).<p>It&#x27;s just not what they&#x27;re about.<p>That is not the story that is interesting to these investors. They would far prefer the first package (as far as I understand) that comes with a bigger shot at the moon, even though this greatly diminishes the overall return.  Tons of companies are very close to being worth $2.5M, and not really more, and don&#x27;t need much money. They&#x27;re just not that interesting.<p>----------------------<p>II<p>Second:<p>A second way you can know that this isn&#x27;t a case is that nobody would even look at an investment like (package 3, hypothetical)<p>Hypothetical:<p><pre><code>  0.0001 probability of 75000x\n  0.9999 unknown result\n  ---------\n</code></pre>\nThis sums to at least 0.0001 * 75000 = 7.5x. But what does it mean?<p>Well, it means investing in something that will grow to 75,000 times its size with a 1/10,000 chance of doing so.<p>It means somehow onboarding 10,000 people - investing $200K into 10000 companies - that are all saying they will turn it into into let&#x27;s say a $60B company.<p>Do you see anyone investing $200K at a $800K valuation into 10,000 nascent companies that are saying they will be $60B companies? And showing very, very little chance of doing so - 1/10,000?<p>Of course not. The amount of money required to invest in, say, 10,000 such companies is $2B. Taking $50K of it would cost $500M. Some VC&#x27;s have this.<p>But do you see any VC&#x27;s with massive, massive onboarding programs where they are pouring $50K into 10,000 companies, that each give you only 1/10 000th confidence that htye&#x27;re actually the next Apple or Google?<p>No. It&#x27;s just not being done. You can play with the numbers but they show that nobody is summing in this way.<p>They want a different distribution that they can believe in. They&#x27;re fearing on missing out on something big.

Because safe investments that paid out reasonably existed, defined benefit pensions were a reasonable thing.<p>The economic reality is very different now, and the very idea that someone could make good on a defined-benefit pension is kinda laughable.  My point is that the economic realities were different in the 80s.

Is that the measure of a successful education system, or a successful society?<p>I think the really dangerous thought is not that the people in the schools are special snowflakes held back by the system, but the realization that those at the top are not special snowflakes and are instead propped up by the system.  Because then even the very faint illusion of meritocracy as a justification for the distribution of wealth and our current system falls apart completely.<p>Perhaps a good education system would also have to face the friction between freedom, merit, enlightenment, democracy, and economic output.  The US has a strong ideological undercurrent that the earlier factors directly lead to the last.  I would argue not only that is it possible that there is in fact potentially an economic cost to a free and enlightened populace, but that such an ideology primarily exists in the US as a social-psychological-bulwark to justify the position of the wealthy.

You&#x27;re making it impossible for yourself to succeed.<p>It&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to start big / expensive / complex businesses without the ability to raise equally large amounts of capital. And raising large amounts of capital for that type of business is nearly impossible without the experience and or connections you&#x27;d properly expect it to require.<p>So let me put this out there: do not try to start such types of businesses, unless e.g. you&#x27;ve got the kind of wind at your back that Elon Musk did after selling PayPal (to then start something like Tesla or SpaceX, which required immense capital and amazing execution, drawn on from huge amounts of experience and plenty of brilliant influences and employees).<p>Imgur, Reddit, Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, eBay, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and on and on. These were not massive, highly complex concept businesses to get started (some of them become very complex of course). In fact, they were small&#x27;ish concepts, narrowly focused, with the capacity to snowball massively.<p>Zuckerberg didn&#x27;t need a billion dollars to build the first version of Facebook, and it wasn&#x27;t complex. Ditto Twitter or YouTube or Snapchat and so on. Facebook started at one college, Zuck knocked over one bowling pin market, and then the next and then the next.<p>What&#x27;s big and elaborate about the core of Candy Crush? Draw Something? Absolutely nothing. You&#x27;ll find most successful businesses start out very simple; in hindsight, they make you think: holy shit, that&#x27;s so stupidly simple why didn&#x27;t I think of it.<p>Even difficult to start businesses typically start from a simple premise or a simple attack approach. Take Tesla for example, Elon didn&#x27;t jump right into trying to make the model S (or a mass consumer electric car). He built up experience, an amazing team, capital, manufacturing experience, technology, a sales channel, a brand, global hype - by first building the low-production roadster for a small group of rich people (which could afford it, which then helped fund the next level of development).<p>Simple idea + easy to get started + low cost to build first version/s + the ability to snowball massively = what you should be building (strictly my opinion). It helps if you can derive sales from day one to use customers as your funding, instead of giving up equity, but that&#x27;s not a requirement depending on what direction you want to go.<p>Also, very importantly: the idea itself matters a lot less than you may think. Ideas are nearly worthless, a dime a dozen. For every Facebook, there are dozens of people that had the same idea and didn&#x27;t execute / didn&#x27;t ever build it.<p>This is one of my favorite articles on this topic:<p><a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2010/08/21/the-bowling-pin-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cdixon.org/2010/08/21/the-bowling-pin-strategy/</a>",1386374451

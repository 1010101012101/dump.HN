If the system has restrictions on microscopic behavior, then Gaussian distribution will not apply. I think the benefit of talent may not be in normal distribution. The distribution of probability depends on the case and conditions that we pay attention to.<p>For example, a talented chef can only serve similar amount dishes in a night as less talented chefs. But the dishes they made taste much better than those and charge more.<p>At the same time, a talented plumber or a talented doctors can not serve more customers or patients than a less talented plumber or doctors.<p>It seems when the benefit of the talent scales, the distribution of their influence is Pareto distribution. So it seems developers, musician, artists, physicists fall into this category.",1254952777

Restaurants have ""special pricing promotions"" to set the expectation that the ""lower price"" perk won't be around forever (and to motivate people by through the creation of temporal scarcity).  During the perk period, the restaurant gets more people in the door by offering a better deal.  Google's perk cycle is opposite that of a restaurant.  During good times, they have to make working there really attractive.  But, right now, they don't have to give away so much, so they can scale back.

867742,comment,867558,867558,0,0,buster,,,"What a stupid post of someone who obviously doesn't know a bit of android app development.
The UI widgets are done through XML (not unlike you do HTML for the browser). And guess what: Browsers can display the same webpage on totally different resolutions and be navigated by keyboard, mouse or whatever you want.<p>It's quite the same for Android. You do the layout in XML, Android scales it and puts it how it fits. This works pretty well.<p>Second: In general every widget, button, whatever can be access by touch or buttons. There is even an android phone without a touchscreen.
This list goes on and on.<p>One part of why android is a great platform is that it is designed from scratch to be a _modern_ mobile operating system and the developers took care of a lot of cases. Unlike some other operating systems, it's new and especially designed for modern hardware (now, look at windows, symbian, and i am wondering how mac osx would perform on a variety of devices...)<p>Another example. 
As a developer you want to have the geographical position of the phone: Easiest way to do is ask for it, regardless of it coming from GPS, WLAN or GSM cell info. But you can also put criteria in the exact same function call if you want exact positioning (say, GPS but von WLAN). Of course, if there is no geo information available the call will tell you this and you have to take care of it. But you'll have to do that anyway, because GPS/WLAN/cell info is not available everytime on a capable device.
This goes on and on in the whole framework.<p>Last but not least:
Afaik, neither iphone apps nor windows mobile nor symbian apps will run on a different CPU architecture. Android apps use a VM and can be just run on every architecture the VM runs for. Switch from ARM to x86? No problem, take the same app (not two versions compiled for two different architecures) and they will run just fine.<p>It's quite shocking that someone writes such a post. It doesn't look like he has even read 1 page of information about android, yet he spreads bullsh<i></i>.

The time is directly proportional to the bits per spindle and so is the probability of latent sector errors, but they are otherwise unrelated. If there were a magical way to recover an array in zero time it would still fail on a URE, and if we took twice the amount of time to recover it wouldn't double the probability of failure (though it would increase it slightly because there would be a larger window for a failure to occur).",1254951726

867711,comment,867452,867633,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"For learning this side of Unix, I've found the following very helpful (note that this is a bit BSD-centric):<p>1. _The Unix Programming Environment_ by Kernighan and Pike. The best overall intro to the pipes, shebangs, and other assorted command line stuff in Unix. Very old school, but still very relevant - those are the root of many of Unix's strengths. (K&P's _The Practice of Programming_ is also excellent, though not as specific to Unix.)<p>2. _Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment_, 2nd ed., by (the late) W. Richard Stevens. This and man pages will go a long way.<p>3. The man pages themselves. It's generally understood that OpenBSD's man pages are particularly well written, but if you're using Linux and the GNU userland, there will be lots of differences in the details.<p>4. The 4.4BSD ""Programmer's Supplementary Documents"" (PSD) - This is a collection of papers and man pages. While some are out of date, and some are mainly of historical interest, the introductions to tools such as make, lex, yacc, gdb, etc. are quite good, and often a tenth the length of the corresponding O'Reilly book. (These papers may be installed with your distro. OpenBSD has them in /usr/share/doc . I bought the book used for a couple bucks.) There are also ""User's Supplementary Documents"" (USD) and System Manager's Manual (SMM) collections, with papers on configuring sendmail, using vi, etc.<p>5. _The Art of Unix Programming_ by Eric S. Raymond - I recommend this one in spite of finding ESR <i>incredibly</i> irritating. It's a very good conceptual overview of the big design ideas in Unix and their ramifications, albeit one interspersed with narcissistic soapboxing by the author.<p>In general, using a Linux distro with a strong emphasis on having a friendly GUI layer can keep you at arms length from really learning Unix. Dig around in /etc. Learn to use cron and ed. (No, really.) Get your hands dirty.<p>I would also highly recommend learning a scripting language that integrates well with C (some people like Perl, Python, or Ruby, I prefer Lua), because really using Unix well is going to involve some C. Working with C isn't scary unless you're trying to build a large system in C - try instead to break it up into a suite of smaller programs, rather than one monolithic one. Take advantage of pipes and all the other existing Unix infrastructure. It's there to help keep complexity at bay.<p>Mostly, though, tinker and explore.",1254951486

It does use select to handle requests that are arriving, and then farm them out.<p>This model does scale pretty well though - you can saturate a T1 with Apache just fine.  Also, it's a pretty decent model for when your connections are causing something to do work (like running a script which hits a database).  If you have everything in one big poll()-happy process, you still have to farm things out to separate processes if they risk blocking.  Well, unless you're using Erlang, which has a scheduler of its own so that its processing doesn't block.<p>Moral of the story: event based servers are faster/smaller/more efficient when it comes to serving static content.  When you start doing more than that, things get more complicated and you generally need to offload work to processes/threads/something in any case.<p>Which is one reason why Apache has always been quite popular, despite the presence of whichever select/poll based server du jour.",1254951103

As a user I like it because it does everything I need it to.<p>Confluence is used here, again for worldwide multi-project deployment. Mediawiki is also used but rarely - when starting a new project developers are given the choice and Confluence is the preferred wiki system. Managers love it because of the excellent Word editing/export features. I like it because it does everything I need it to.<p>Downside of both: the searching on either system isn't that great.

Y'all recall, I assume, that SourceForge was a spin off of VALinux, which in its day (the first boom) was, I seem to recall, the fastest rising IPO in history (which means the funders, founders, and underwriters made off like bandits, and the company ended up with far less capital than it should have gotten out of the deal, and I won't even mention the folks who bought shares at those prices).  And, certainly, it was the biggest Open Source related IPO in history.<p>I've often wondered why they've waited out the whole web 2.0 thing, as seems to be what happened.  Now that we have another bust on our hands, they're starting to try something new.  Fixing Sourceforge might have been a good place to start, in order to slow the bleed of projects to other hosting options, but I guess trying new things is good, too.  (We're still hosting our OSS stuff there, but I wouldn't choose it for a new project.)",1223931418

Some companies can be built cheap and they can reach profitability quickly. Not all companies can follow this model. Sequoia doesn't just invest in YC style companies that can be built by 2 people over 3 months.

IMHO soon enough at a time where there's plenty of venture capital to go around might be very different from soon enough at a time when capital is scarce.

They aren't telling people to stop taking any risks-- they are telling people to prepare for a down market, which DOES affect the trajectory of a startup (even if they are on the right track).  Pasting bits from my comment on SvN:<p>In a happier financial times, customers are flush and buying. Buyer confidence is high. Growth is easier, your sales/marketing spend can be a touch lower, etc.<p>In happier financial times, VC-backed startups can count on more investment if they are generally moving in the right direction. Whether you think VC-backed startups are stupid or not, that’s how the game they are playing works. Funding in a down market is scarce and terms are rougher.<p>In happier financial times, VC-backed startups have a better shot at an exit (IPO, M&A). Again, whether you think it’s stupid or not, that’s the game.<p>Your Google/Pets.com argument is kinda strawmanny itself.  Pets.com died because they didn't create much value.  There were times in Google's growth that they would've DIED if they couldn't get funding.  Growth costs money and revenue can be realized months or years after smart spending.  If you don't have a big war chest and capital is scarce (and expensive) it makes sense to grow a touch slower.",1223931196

331492,comment,330995,330995,0,0,iigs,,,"The overall WiMAX picture is about providing a foundation for next generation devices to innovate. That's not BS and I'm not a CEO, so forgive that it sounds kind of mission-statementy and let's dig in:<p>Devices are getting bigger and faster at every announcement. Today a college graduate can put into an Altoids tin a device that is faster and more powerful in every dimension than the desktop computer they started high school with. A similar thing has happened with mobile data networks -- the phone I purchased eight years ago could not send text messages, and the only ""browser"" type functionality it had was a very crippled WAP implementation. The back end was overwhelmingly voice oriented. WiMAX is about bridging the gap from IP on your phone as a novelty to IP as an expectation -- IP as the default, and possibly only protocol for communication.<p>WiMAX itself isn't some kind of miracle protocol. It has some very desirable attributes, and was subject to a large amount of review by companies, from carriers to silicon vendors. People that say that WiMAX itself is going to revolutionize anything are dreaming, just as naysayers are missing the bigger picture.<p>The bigger picture, here, is that new radio links are capable of consuming enough bandwidth that carriers need to rethink their backhaul, or site to main internet connection, infrastructure. One of the reasons, to date, that the incumbent carriers have treated data so gingerly is because their towers are frequently served by a small number of T1s, each 1.5 megabit. If you have 4 T1s to a site, you only have 6mbit total, which of course could be consumed by a single aggressive user, even with existing 3G technology.<p>The backhaul requirements of WiMAX (and LTE) are going to require intense effort invested by the carriers. The carrier(s) that do the best job on this aspect of the network are going to be in a position to offer the most flexible data plans, which may drive a lot of customer adoption (innovative platforms that can't work anywhere else). Carriers that punt on this are going to need to traffic shape to keep the network under control, and this will limit what they can offer their customers and at what price.<p>Disclosure: I have skin in this game.",1223929921

I can remember in the late 1980s you could buy a new home for less than $100k. Good luck doing that now!! I find it incredible that people can afford to buy, and live in, these huge homes. They pay hundreds a month just for electricity. Astounding.",1223928693

It's actually a Firefox extension, allowing ones without a native IME to input Chinese chars in text fields. However, both typd.in and that plugin share a similar limitation: it's unusable OUTSIDE the browser :|<p>Plus, what's your target audience? Anyone serious enough to type Japanese should have some native IME installed, right?",1223928478

That is worth something to the people doing the hiring, which is why they are willing to pay the added costs of locating a business there.  If outsourced development was always a win, areas like the bay area would disintegrate on their own.<p>This is why no one worries about top-shelf product development jobs being ""outsourced"" for the most part.  If developer talent was fungible in this way, we'd have seen rampant ""outsourcing"" to St. Louis and Pittsburgh long before it became popular in Bangalore or Beijing.  The jobs at risk of being moved offshore are those doing lower-level ""IT"" jobs.  These are the people who were complaining a decade ago about being replaced by contractors -- it's the same principle.",1223928058

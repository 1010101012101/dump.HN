This is a similar process that you would have to go through to open a bank account at any US bank. You make it seem like &quot;It took over 45 minutes&quot; but this was your first withdraw, subsequent withdraws would only require the ~10 minutes to confirm your deposit of BTC into the robocoin wallet. 10 minutes to (reliably) convert BTC to cash is unheard of.

If you want to read a really scathing attack on MongoDB, consider this post:<p><a href=""http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never...</a><p>But I recall reading that essay and thinking &quot;These people don&#x27;t want a document store, they want a relational database&quot; and most of their criticism amounts to &quot;MongoDB is not a relational database.&quot;<p>In my experience, you have to love map/reduce if you are going to have a positive experience with MongoDB. I mean this in the abstract sense: both your project and your mind need to be able to fit with that pattern of data flow that is called map/reduce. I&#x27;m thinking of map/reduce in broad terms: use a filter to get some data, use reduce to produce some aggregate.<p>I will here briefly mention a criticism I have of relational databases. Consider Wikipedia&#x27;s explanation of Edgar F. Codd&#x27;s life:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd</a><p>&quot;Codd&#x27;s theorem, a result proven in his seminal work on the relational model, equates the expressive power of relational algebra and relational calculus (which, in essence, is equivalent to first-order logic).&quot;<p>and Codd&#x27;s theorem:<p>&quot;The domain independent relational calculus queries are precisely those relational calculus queries that are invariant under choosing domains of values beyond those appearing in the database itself. That is, queries that may return different results for different domains are excluded. An example of such a forbidden query is the query &quot;select all tuples other than those occurring in relation R&quot;, where R is a relation in the database. Assuming different domains, i.e., sets of atomic data items from which tuples can be constructed, this query returns different results and thus is clearly not domain independent. Codd&#x27;s Theorem is notable since it establishes the equivalence of two syntactically quite dissimilar languages: relational algebra is an imperative, variable-free language, while relational calculus is a logical language with variables and quantification.&quot;<p>Clearly, this assumes that the relations among the data are known. I work mostly with early stage startups. The entrepreneurs I work with have no real idea about what relations they want establish among their data. They are an exploratory phase. I believe these entrepreneurs should be described as &quot;pre Codd&quot;. If you force them to specify relations among their data, you will get answers exactly as useful as these:<p><a href=""http://blog.jimmyr.com/Funny_student_Exam_Answers_13_2008.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jimmyr.com/Funny_student_Exam_Answers_13_2008.ph...</a><p>MongoDB is useful in this context. Start acquiring data. Don&#x27;t pretend you know what your schema is. You do not know what your schema is. The entrepreneur who perfectly understands what sort of data they want, and what the relations will be among the different sets of data, before the startup has launched, is a bit like Newton and Einstein: you can expect 1 such person every 200 years.",1395338074

Also, I think the desire to encapsulate authorization into a reusable object seems slightly more in the spirit of the emerging school.<p>What I find odd is that they&#x27;d offer a solution for authorization which is so bound up in Rails magic.  It seems to me authorization is really part of the domain model and as such you would expect to find that code in whatever gets called by the controller (which I would expect to be something like an interactor, but in this blog post is just plain old Rails code.)",1395337917

On the bright side, the half year since I quit was a really great time.<p>So it sounds, like you are making mistakes, because you made mistakes.

It is a struggle day after day and accomplishments can only be evaluated in hindsight, sometimes you underestimate the time a project will take usually you overestimate and the roads not taken only look good because you never encountered the roadblocks on them.

Social isolation triggered it, and now you feel like a failure because your thinking habits are diseased.<p>Usually when we fail at something we make excuses such as &quot;I wasn&#x27;t prepared for this&quot; or &quot;I just needed more time&quot;. Most of the time these excuses are reasonable, other times they are delusional. No matter the validity, excuses protect your self-esteem and psychological well-being.<p>When you put yourself in an environment where there are simply no excuses you are in full responsibility of your actions. When you fail, the only logical conclusion is that you&#x27;re stupid, not fit for the job, a deluded loser.<p>An environment where you have full control over the variables implies that there is no other person meddling with it. Control requires isolation, but us human beings were never meant to be completely isolated and it takes a heavy toll on our well-being.<p>I personally worked myself out of this hole by giving my depression some meaning. Before I was proud of my skills, fiercely independent, even a bit arrogant. Going through this allowed me to really appreciate the value of my friendships and family. It allowed me to see the importance of relaxing, enjoying and exploring life. It made me humble and sympathetic towards other peoples struggles. Had you written this one year ago I would have told you &quot;man up and get your shit together&quot;.<p>Above all, it allowed me to deeply explore my inner self and feel at ease with my short-comings.

Many people work to change or better the world for their entire lives while only viewing change in the smallest ways. It&#x27;s not a realistic expectation that you will generate something world changing in the span of a year, or even two. So to be happier you need to learn how to enjoy yourself while you work and learn, whatever it takes.<p>Learning how to manage yourself and your life is one of the greatest keys to completing a project. If you are successful in your world changing idea, but you have not learned to manage yourself, how are you going to manage other people? Start out by training yourself as a manager with your first employee - yourself. You would not want a boss that worked you night and day with unrealistic expectations. So - don&#x27;t be that boss. You can be hard, but reward yourself too. And give yourself the time it takes to really learn.<p>Personally happiness for me includes going to the gym daily, sleeping well, eating well, and seeing family. And I&#x27;m getting closer to some of my goals than ever before. When I worked myself late into the night and didn&#x27;t eat well, I actually saw my goals slipping away since I was no longer managing myself in a direction that would actually bring about the goals I had set. Maybe I was chasing after short term deadlines, but not really striving toward life goals.

The performance difference is not that important when choosing between these languages, because they are all slow anyway. If you compare PHP vs Java or Ruby vs NodeJS, then performance gain might be an important factor when choosing. Python is used more outside of webdev than PHP and Ruby, so that might be something to consider, because there are more libraries for making UIs, games, graphics, etc.",1395336980

7437179,comment,7435720,7436825,2,0,zanny,,,"> My main point is that in a market where can freely consume a freeware, free software and fully proprietary software is a free market. A world with only free software is still one sided.<p>And my argument is a world with only free software is just one without copyright law. How about we add in a new kind of software - loanshark software. You have to pay monthly and you get a random file from the source code each month as per the EULA. We don&#x27;t have much of that software around, though, so I guess the market is lopsided and needs more balance?<p>It is all artificial, and yes, even the release-the-source part of the GPL is artificial. But if we lived in a world without copyright, we wouldn&#x27;t need the release the source stipulations because you couldn&#x27;t profit off artificial scarcity of information anymore anyway, so not releasing the source would just be considered a dick move. But platform lock in matters a lot less when you have no way to profit by &quot;having the platform&quot; since you can&#x27;t enforce distribution restrictions.<p>> but if there is no free alternative competitive sacrificing is how we live in this world.<p>What software is there without free alternatives? I&#x27;d get started tomorrow on any unique problem not addressed to some degree by a free software project. If you are going to argue &quot;the proprietary has more features and convenience than the free&quot;, then of course it does, our current copyright regime enables the profiteering off information denial, you can make <i>profit</i> off of denying freedoms. So businesses can bloom under it. It just means you are leeching value out of artificial constructs and are redirecting effort and money artificially.<p>> Is there not enough people already writing code and plugins for LibreOffice suite? Sounds like free software moment is pushing people to write free software because they don&#x27;t have enough developers who are willing to put time writing code for free software.<p>There are <i>never</i> enough people. We could have most of the human species devoted to the development of free software and we wouldn&#x27;t have enough. There is always work to be done, especially if you are claiming MS office as having features Libre doesn&#x27;t - then yes, Libre is understaffed and needs either funding or developer hours to make it better, and that is your (and my, and everyone elses) responsibility if you believe in software freedom. If you don&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t consider it, then the entire argument is moot since the whole position of free software assumes a belief in it by providing its rational argument for why it is optimal and why proprietary software is bad.<p>> That&#x27;s why free software movement from R.S. is radical to me.<p>And your stance is radical to me, because I think respecting a users freedom should be assumed, not extraneous.<p>> If we shall, free software is awesome, it has the ability to study and modify the software in any way the user wants, now, how do I make a living off my work?<p>You do the same thing you do anywhere else, you propose value and seek compensation for your work. &quot;I want to add bloom filters to GIMP, but will need about 400 hours to do so, and at $50 an hour that is about $20000 of work, so if I can raise that money I&#x27;ll implement the feature&quot;.<p>The same thing applies to pretty much all other copyrighted works, but this is beyond the scope of free software arguments and into the anti-copyright movement, but it boils down to &quot;charge for scarce resources, not for artificially restricted infinite information&quot;.",1395336920

7437108,comment,7430501,7434875,1,0,derefr,,,"Let me highlight the most important part of what I said:<p>> And, as with nearsightedness, it&#x27;s readily apparent to those who use the prosthetic that they <i>were</i> impaired, because they now have access to experiences that they may have heard unimpaired people speaking of, but never previously got to experience for themselves.<p>The human body requires its internal chemicals to be maintained within certain ranges for various features to function. Each of these features is relevant to what would be called &quot;the human experience&quot;--things that are built into the generalized human utility-function to want, as terminal values.<p>When you have a neurotransmitter imbalance <i>to a degree that it becomes an impairment</i>, it is so because it disables some of these features, and therefore bars one&#x27;s access to these terminal values.<p>In AD(H)D, the feature that gets impaired is the &quot;sense of intrinsic motivation&quot; generated by the dopamine system. The terminal values one loses access to are the feelings of striving, accomplishment, or pride in one&#x27;s work; and, in more extreme cases, the feeling to hope that one will be able to improve one&#x27;s lot in life by one&#x27;s own hand. (When you <i>know</i> you can&#x27;t motivate yourself to get a job, being jobless is a lot more depressing.)<p>When you apply the appropriate prosthetic to the impairment--combined dopamine agonist/reuptake inhibitors, in this case--you gain access to this feature, and through it, the terminal values you were barred from.<p>As with putting on glasses, if you <i>have</i> the impairment (everything is blurry), then it is very, <i>very</i> obvious that when everything comes into focus, that this is the way things were &quot;meant&quot; to be--not from some moral imperative, but just because <i>the rest of your body was built to rely on this feature that was previously broken</i>.<p>With glasses, this means you suddenly stop bumping into things, and don&#x27;t find yourself moving closer to people to see them. With normalized dopamine levels, this means you suddenly feel able to <i>make yourself</i> accomplish things you&#x27;ve always wanted to accomplish.<p>If your dopamine is set to the correct range <i>for your body</i>, this doesn&#x27;t &quot;make you into a robot&quot; or any of the things people talk about with various neuroaffective drugs. Inasmuch as that was ever true in clinical settings, it was from failure to identify the neurotransmitter which is in imbalance (i.e. treating a norepinephrine production deficiency with dopamine agonists).<p>---<p>And now, a rant:<p>Inasmuch as AD(H)D treatment is made out to be a problem in pop-culture, though, it does indeed come from &quot;overdiagnosis&quot;--if you give a drug to boost a neurotransmitter <i>into</i> a reference range to someone who <i>is not impaired</i>, you will of course boost that neurotransmitter <i>out</i> of the reference range it was already in. People who can see fine already will find glasses quite harmful to their vision.<p>&quot;Overdiagnosis&quot; is a very strong word for what happens with AD(H)D, though. Population studies have been done, with random samples of adults brought in off the street given strict evaluations to test for AD(H)D--and as much as 3% of the population has scored far into the &quot;impaired&quot; range. (This is, coincidentally-enough, about the same percentage we see for all the other neurotransmitter-reference-range problems, e.g. clinical depression, giving merit to the genetic-drift hypothesis.) This number is far higher than the number of people actually diagnosed with AD(H)D. The stigma behind &quot;overdiagnosis&quot; has lead to underdiagnosis.<p>The real problem, of course, is parents wanting to treat their children for neurotransmitter imbalances at all. <i>Children do not have stable neurotransmitter reference ranges.</i> Their brains produce random spurts of neurotransmitters at random times, just like their bodies produce random spurts of growth in random body parts. (This is why children have such vivid nightmares and fantasies: random spurts of serotonin will induce visual and auditory hallucinations, much as are found during an LSD trip; coupled with random spurts of adrenaline, these hallucinations can be quite stressful. It is also why they may not &quot;feel tired&quot; after being awake for many hours: due to random spurts of acetylcholine, their bodies can be effectively self-caffeinating. You can surmise how this applies to each other neurotransmitter as well.)<p>AD(H)D is <i>not</i> a &quot;childhood disease&quot;, any more than nearsightedness is. Both impairments tend to first reveal themselves, oddly-enough, when one is first asked in childhood to sit and stare at a blackboard--but this doesn&#x27;t imply that the problem <i>goes away</i> when the blackboard does. In fact, it usually gets worse--but there is no longer a set of parents being sent report cards to indicate a problem which they might get it into their heads to &quot;fix.&quot;<p>So, when I say &quot;get checked for AD(H)D,&quot; I&#x27;m intending that advice <i>for adults.</i> Children might certainly have AD(H)D already--if you have a neurotransmitter imbalance, it&#x27;s almost always present from a very young age--but the rampage of random neurotransmitter releases during development will moot any sort of prosthetic, just like (no, not glasses this time!) a bone- or skull-plate to fix a break would be inadvisable for a child: their bones haven&#x27;t finished growing or forming, and the plate would soon harm instead of help.<p>Having said that, school systems <i>must</i> be designed around the fact that children will have various neurochemical imbalances--whether temporarily due to growth, or permanently, due to genetic problems--and around the fact that it is <i>improper</i> to expect the child to be treated for these before their neurology stabilizes. Grade-school must be an environment where a child is given the resources to succeed <i>despite</i> neurochemical imbalances. This calls for a radical restructuring, much moreso than the &quot;radical&quot; ideas one sees proffered on education around HN.",1395336449

7437040,comment,7436140,7436812,2,0,Jtsummers,,,"Aside from property taxes on the dealerships&#x27; land holdings, most states have ad valorem taxes on cars. This is typically paid whether you bought the car in the state or not, often at the time you register the vehicle in a state. This is also, typically, an annual tax. So if I buy a car in FL and register it in GA, I&#x27;ll essentially pay sales tax twice (once in FL and once at registration in GA, also depends on how much the ad valorem tax is). So GA tax revenue will be consistent whether I buy it from the dealership or from Tesla.<p>Regarding employees, direct sales will reduce the number of sales people, yes. Or it&#x27;ll change the nature of the salesman&#x27;s job. From pusher on a commission to a salaryman. Now, Tesla and other electrics may not need frequent work done by mechanics (even the standard maintenance stuffs), but other cars still would. Just because I bought my Subaru from Subaru proper instead of the local dealership doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t need to take it in for service every 6 (or so) months.<p>And if electric cars really do have an effect on employment of mechanics and service technicians, then that&#x27;s the consequence. We can&#x27;t legislate the cars away to preserve jobs anymore than we can legislate manufacturing robots away to preserve the jobs of the assembly line worker. (That said, a change in employment status of a large segment of the population will have to be dealt with. Either by charity, retraining, welfare or some combination of those and other methods I&#x27;ve not mentioned.)",1395336012

You must apply for a change of status as quickly as possible (this isn&#x27;t too difficult), to switch to a different visa (B1 or B2, and the appropriate visa for your spouse). These will allow you to stay in the country for several months.<p>Then, you have until your I-94 date (on a H-1B this is normally the date your visa expires) to find another employer who will sponsor you for a H-1B transfer. This transfer is exactly the same as a transfer from a current employer; you can begin work immediately, and the cap does not apply.<p>It&#x27;s these sorts of tales that make me thankful that I have a very good, honest immigration professional.

Showrooms had crèches and children’s play areas and offered coffee. Cars were not serviced at the same location, but rather by the well-known retailer Halfords in their out-of-town service centres. The themes used by Daewoo to further differentiate itself included good value, reliable cars (3 year warranties, AA breakdown cover) with additional safety features (eg ABS brakes and side impact protection) and additional features and benefits that would otherwise be extra cost (eg power steering, no-fuss guarantees, courtesy cars or pick up and collection for services).

Now they&#x27;ve written (1) a compiler to C++, (2) a compiler to VM byte code, (3) a corresponding runtime for each, (4) extensions to PHP, (5) a type checker, and (6) an inference engine. That&#x27;s a lot of stuff.<p>All languages, runtimes, and standard libraries (and databases, and source control, and on and on) are &quot;broken&quot; at sufficient scale. You&#x27;re going to be spending time rebuilding things other people take for granted no matter who you are and what language and technology you are working in. The underlying assumption that a &quot;proper language&quot; gives you these things for free is completely false.<p>> Writing correct type checkers and inference engines is kind of difficult.<p>Just so we are clear, you ask why Facebook didn&#x27;t rewrite 10,000 human-years of code into a mythical unnamed &quot;proper&quot; language, but you consider writing a type checker to be &quot;difficult&quot;. I think you might have vastly inaccurate pictures of what is and isn&#x27;t &quot;difficult&quot;.<p>> That way, the compiler is now almost an engine to prove your code is correct. I don&#x27;t see how the same guarantee can be made with something that is just cobbled together.<p>Computing history is littered with dead projects from people who believed that anything less than perfect is unworkable or non-valuable.",1395335428
7436949,comment,7435720,7436178,2,0,torrent-of-ions,,,"> The point, for me at least, is to increase the total volume of freedom in the world.<p>Yes, absolutely.  This is something I rarely hear mentioned.  Many people consider freedom only as a local optimisation problem.  This is why some people argue that the BSD licence, or the public domain, is &quot;freer&quot; than the GPL.  It&#x27;s true that if you receive a program which is in the public domain that your personal freedom is maximised with respect to that current program.  It&#x27;s also true that if you receive a program licensed under the GPL that you have less personal freedom (you now lack the freedom to deprive others of the same freedom you received).<p>But we can do better than this.  Freedom is a global optimisation problem.  Locally optimised freedom is called divide and conquer.  Copyleft is the best solution that I&#x27;m aware of for the global optimisation problem.  It should also be noted that copyleft itself only needs to exist in order to &quot;undo&quot; the effects of copyright.  Public domain would be a trivial solution to the global problem if copyright didn&#x27;t exist, or at least didn&#x27;t exists in its current form whereby it automatically attaches itself to anything and everything.  Having a world where both copyright and trivial copying by each member of society exists makes this a non-trivial problem.",1395335427

On a local level, away from the large cities, it&#x27;s not uncommon for the guy or gal that owns (not necessarily the same as the name is on the sign though) the local dealership to be the area&#x27;s state senator or state representative.  No amount of lobbying or money from tesla, etc, are going to convince him to vote against his/her own business.",1395334942

Interesting, but not much fun.<p>Commercially, we commonly used cross assemblers or cross compilers and simulators that ran on minicomputers (like DEC VAXen).  We could then burn the output to PROMs to put in the target machine for final debugging.  Later we used a more specialized cross development environment (HP 64000 and Intel MDS) which had a big cable tied to a pod that plugged into the CPU socket on the target, allowing much more sophisticated debugging.",1395334939

Or that that even adds to significant extra costs for the consumer. By &quot;significant&quot; I mean the extra cost per car because there is a dealer.

7436872,comment,7435720,7435720,2,0,cottonseed,,,"It is interesting to read this through the eyes of the burgeoning Open Source Hardware (OSH) community.  There seems to be an Free Hardware Foundation in Italy, but I have never seen it mentioned before, and rarely do I see discussion of the sort of essential freedoms I see Stallman is talking about.  However, I often see people struggling with (and reverse engineering) proprietary hardware, firmware and software.  Hardware tools often come feature locked and internals are intentionally obscured, down to sanding the labels off chips.  When the question of open tools comes up, the response is usually something like this: &quot;How much demand is there for, say, a 100 MHz open &#x27;scope that costs a bit more than a Rigol?&quot;  Taken from a recent discussion about Free/Open Hardware:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7375771"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7375771</a><p>Does the Free Hardware movement need a Stallman?",1395334894

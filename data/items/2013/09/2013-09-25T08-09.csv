6443340,comment,6442289,6443310,13,0,anovikov,,,"Not true at all. Your statement about available land is correct of course, but the important part of picture is that the soft costs for construction of solar electric power plants are already much higher than hard costs. And, improving efficiency is a great way to cut them.<p>Imagine a 10 MW power plant built out of panels with 10% efficiency. If you replace them with 20% efficient panels, you increase output 2x without measurably increasing soft costs - like land provision, fixtures on which the panels stand, installation work, insurance, etc. Only part that will increase will be inverters (not a particulary big item) and thicker cables connecting it to the grid. So, soft costs per watt will fall by 40-45%.<p>So, given that the wholesale price of solar panels now stand at 40 cent per watt, and even in cheapest countries the complete plant is $2 per watt, increasing efficiencies 2x means building a 2x more powerful plant for about $1.4 per watt (soft costs fall from $1.6 to $1.0 - i.e. they slightly increase but power output doubles) and hard costs stay the same. Big deal.<p>And almost all of the progress in solar power costs we can have now lies in this field - increase of panel efficiency, not decreasing their costs. Even if panels were free, costs won&#x27;t fall much...<p>Of course this article bears no relation to that - these are high concentration cells, and cost to build collectors is already  much higher than just buying enough of flat panels... better show me a non-concentrated cell with at least 35% efficiency.",1380098298

6443310,comment,6442289,6442289,19,0,dredmorbius,,,"For those wondering about the significance of this announcement:<p>As several people have noted, what matters for solar PV isn&#x27;t <i>efficiency</i> but <i>cost per Watt</i>.  The maximum <i>available</i> energy is 1W/meter^2 at ground.  Single-layer PV efficiency is on the order of about 40%.  Mutliple-layer cells can reach a maximum of around 80%.<p>Even with existing efficiencies, the land space necessary to dedicate to solar power for all electrical energy needs is reasonably small.  A percent or so of the Earth&#x27;s surface.  The hard part will be fabricating the PV and/or CSP (concentrated solar thermal power) plants to collect that energy, estimates run well over $100 trillion globally (Jacobson & Delucchi).<p>A key limiting factor in solar, wind, and other intermittent renewables is <i>storage</i> (or baseload / standby power).  Assuming you&#x27;d want 7 days&#x27; total energy output on reserve, there&#x27;s quite literally not enough lead in the world to build storage for just the US, let alone the rest of the world.  Pumped hydro storage is very efficient, but sites are limited.  Biomass similarly doesn&#x27;t scale to present populations.  Geothermal is good for 5-20% of power demands depending on locations (and some places such as Iceland might be able to export energy).  Thorium reactors look like a plausible bet but require development.  Liquid metal / molten salt batteries (such as Donald Sadoway&#x27;s designs) look like they&#x27;re both cheap and abundant enough to make the grade, though they&#x27;re still under development as well.<p>Solar power <i>does</i> have its equivalent of Moore&#x27;s Law:  Swanson&#x27;s Law.  Solar PV costs fall by 20% with each doubling of capacity.  It&#x27;s held since the 1970s and looks likely to continue.  Effectively, costs half about every 3 years.

For ground-based generation, look for costs to come down further.<p>And pray for highly effective storage solutions.",1380097675

  * Person on the swarm is necessarily there to download
  * Person on the swarm is necessarily downloading something they don&#x27;t have a license for
  * Person on the swarm is necessarily consuming the media they&#x27;re downloading (some people just like to collect)
  * Public trackers are the only means of pirating via torrent
  * Other mediums are completely ignored (IRC/Usenet/HTTP sites/EDonkey/DC++/etc etc etc etc)</code></pre>",1380096388

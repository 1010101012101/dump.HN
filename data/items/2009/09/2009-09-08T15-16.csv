Whom understand the long hours, and the large feat that you are trying to accomplish, and you can be successful.  Have a supportive wife/husband, parents, friends etc, and you will be ok.  If they are not supportive, then maybe they are not the ones for you.  Cannot do both without that support.",1252422282

People only care about whether a company is evil if it creates products and services they <i>want</i> to use, or whether the company is so massive that it can't be avoided.<p>Small companies can't, and companies with crappy products don't, inflict their evil upon you -- so no-one notes whether they're evil or not, skewing results.<p>It could well be (and I believe it to be the case) that <i>every</i> company is essentially 'evil', but that tendency can only be exposed when they attain the requisite leverage to push what they want, as a priority, onto the market.",1252422092

Almost all hospitals were the same, there was one good hospital, and then there was this hospital which had twice the C-sections of any other.  But it&#x27;s the hospital that gets the hard cases, a friend later delivered there (I think by C-section) after barely avoiding premature labor from 20 weeks to 35 weeks.

6872277,comment,6871650,6871650,1,0,brickcap,,,"I picked up on erlang during august this year after reading an article by Joe Armstrong on it. I was new to functional programming and there were two things that I found really interesting.<p>First was the use of atoms. I am not too proud to say it, but when I as a beginner I used lots of &quot;magic strings&quot; in my code. I found them a lot more easier to understand.Stuff like<p>if(a=&quot;run&quot;)\n//some piece of code here<p>was common in my code. Of course the best practice was to use a bool run, but I had to train myself to stop using magic strings when I found out that it was bad practice.<p>In erlang however it is very common to use literal values which are known as atoms. So for instance an atom &quot;blue&quot; is blue. It does not have anything associated with it(well internally it is represented as an integer). You can&#x27;t perform any operations on it, you can&#x27;t change it etc. And it immediately clicked with me<p>The second thing was pattern matching<p>You have got to use pattern matching to see how awesome it is. It allows you to make your  programes much more readable by dividing your function into a group of clauses. A clause will be executed only if a corresponding pattern matches to it. If you use it well you can grasp the flow of your program in a single reading.<p>There was other really cool stuff about erlang like otp, concurrency etc but when I started with it the only things that I cared for were atoms and pattern matching.They got me started with erlang. Now that I have used erlang a bit more I find things like gen_events and gen_fsm behaviors invaluable for the stuff that I am trying to do.",1386549668

See &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; by Herman and Chomsky.<p>> so I struggle to understand where you gain the insight to claim Rusbridger &#x27;would have been loath to sign off&#x27; the Snowden leaks.<p>It is a straightforward application of common sense that is supported by critical media analysis and nearly tautological: Powerful organizations are powerful. The government has a great deal of influence on the Guardian and those who work there. Opposing the government in a serious way typically results in hardship while supporting them yields benefits. You still have to maintain the appearance of seriously challenging power so that people buy your paper but you can go far without actually having to do much of it.<p>The only reason they got away with it this time is they can claim that they were &quot;forced&quot; by the fact that other newspapers also published and that their publishing wouldn&#x27;t have been a factor in whether the material was disclosed.<p>> which also partnered with Wikileaks around the time of &#x27;Collateral Murder&#x27; etc.<p>Same situation with multiple publishers. Even in that case they redacted names of elite, public individuals, claiming it was to protect themselves from libel allegations.<p>> There are two false dichotomies...<p>I never made either claim. Surely Bernstein should praise Snowden and Greenwald to the extent he has praised Rusbridger and <i>before</i> he praises Rusbridger? And competition is not the only factor but when competition for a particularly story exists it both forces a publisher&#x27;s hand and protects them: They look foolish if they don&#x27;t publish because somebody else will and they can claim their publication made no difference because someone else is going to publish anyway. In fact this might be one of the few reliable ways to pressure publishers to actually publish sensitive material: Leakers should give material to several news organizations in different countries and tell them so without disclosing the names of those organizations.",1386549226

Given that Bluetooth is already ubiquitous on computers and smartphones, and Bluetooth LE is starting to catch on, it&#x27;s pretty likely that Bluetooth could supplant Zigbee in not too long if a few hardware vendors started selling Bluetooth controlled hardware rather than Zigbee.<p>So yes, you can get a Zigbee hub and use Zigbee via a hub, or you can use something that connects via WiFi. Zigbee has the disadvantage that you need a separate hub. WiFi is quite complex (and thus more expensive) and doesn&#x27;t work well for low-power applications. Bluetooth LE has neither of these problems; it&#x27;s simpler and lower power than WiFi, and already has ubiquitous device support so you don&#x27;t need some other interface hub to plug into your network.<p>Note that the WeMo Insight switch (the one that&#x27;s comparable to these, as it provides energy monitoring) costs $60, while these cost $45 each; which is a pretty big difference if you want to wire up a bunch of lights.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://elinux.org/6lowpan/ROLL_support_on_802.15.4_radios\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://elinux.org/6lowpan/ROLL_support_on_802.15.4_radios</a>",1386548393

A few points:<p>- We emailed people to update their availability. If they were available this week, we&#x27;d email. Otherwise they could set their busyness to between 1 week and 3 months.<p>- We tracked where people were working and used that to bill  the companies that hired them. First we charged a flat subscription rate of $3600 per year but people didn&#x27;t want to pay that. We then charged $100 per week per freelancer. They wanted to go back to paying the subscription again. Then we went broke.<p>- People won&#x27;t keep their availabilities up to date. They won&#x27;t like you asking them to keep their availabilities up to date either. They really won&#x27;t like you asking them where they&#x27;re working this week.<p>- People will ask you how you&#x27;re curating the list. If you&#x27;re not curating it, theirs no point in using it as I can get list of people to hire anywhere. I want a list of people that are good at what they do.<p>- Recruiters function because they hide the cost of hiring freelancers. You&#x27;re a design agency, your charge out rate is $250/h. Hiring this gun front end developer through a recruiter costs me $100/h. I make $150/h, simple math.<p>The most important things to solve from POV is how you&#x27;re going to curate the list and keep the bad coders off it. You want to start with A&#x27;s and only have A&#x27;s. As soon as B&#x27;s creep onto the list then your reputation goes down.

In grade 12 I got on to a national competition sort of thing that taught you python as you went and ended placing really well. I really enjoyed the challenges, so I decided to try and teach myself a bit more, but schoolwork got in the way, so I shelved that idea for a year or so.<p>I later decided after doing a fair amount of front end design work for friends and family that I&#x27;d try and learn back end development, so I tried python again, using the flask microframework. I did a few small projects with that, then I found sinatra on ruby and ended up really enjoying ruby more than python. I ended up working pretty much entirely in ruby for any back end dev stuff (although it wasn&#x27;t very much), and slowly improved my javascript skills.<p>During Uni, I have also learned enough C# to make my way around. In my second year, I got a job doing front and back end dev, and made my first big project using sinatra and I loved it.<p>Later on we needed to write some software that interfaced with a label printer, and the best library we could find was for java, which none of us knew (nor did we want to learn). I had been reading about clojure and liked the look of it (and heard that it had great java interop) and I made my first (very dodgy) clojure app to interface with the printer.<p>I got hooked on functional programming then, and in the past year and a half, I&#x27;ve learned up on a few different languages. I have vastly improved my Javascript skills after using Backbone.js and then Angular.js. I also improved my Clojure skills, by re-writing my first work sinatra app using compojure, as well as a few side projects. I also took an interest in Erlang and Elixir after hearing about both on HN, and I learned the basics by reading &#x27;Learn you an Erlang&#x27;, and trying to make a few small project in both.

I have Type II bipolar, and I am certainly prone to poor judgement and borderline delusional thought patterns in an untreated manic episode. However, I am on a medication regimen, that while not perfect, makes me effectively indistinguishable from a &quot;normal&quot; person in day-to-day interactions.<p>However, categorically suggesting that people should &quot;keep [their] distance&quot; from those with bipolar disorder seems like an extremely destructive message. As another commenter pointed out, there is a spectrum (as with any mental disorder), and I feel like sweeping generalizations of the societal risks of individuals with BP serve to exacerbate the issue of negative stigma surrounding the disease.<p>At what threshold of treatment efficacy <i>should</i> those with BP be allowed to participate equally and without stigma, in your opinion? Will it require some sort of brain stimulation to address the root cause? genetic engineering to attempt to prevent it? more advanced mood stablizers?<p>Treatment has progressed substantially from the heavily stigmatized 40s-80s already, and it&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume that eventually it may become trivial to treat for the majority of cases.

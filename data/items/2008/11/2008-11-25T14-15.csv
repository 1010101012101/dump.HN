376390,comment,374390,376054,0,0,cconstantine,,,"Perforce is not terrible.  I'd even go so far as to say; of the centralized systems, it's better than any other I've tried (including Subversion, and cvs).  It could be better, but it could be much worse.<p><pre><code>  Things we like about perforce:
   - Client side changelists for modified client side code.  This helps organize our local 
     changes to make sure when we're working on multiple things they stay separate.
   - The server is solid.
   - Can handle large files, including the ability to 'forget' previous revisions to save space
     on the server.  It's abusing the system, and we've been told as much by Perforce.  It just
     happens to be the way we do business, and changing that is another project.
   - It can do branching/merging
   - The visual diff and merge tools are pretty good (mostly, more below).
   - Everything that's under revision control is in one place.  If you don't want to have the 
     files on your workstation you can simply remove that tree from your view.

  Things we dislike about perforce:
   - It costs money.  At the size of our organization it costs about as much as another employee.  
     This is the reason we were 'given the OK'; developers don't really care about cost as long as 
     we're employed, and management doesn't really care about features as long as we're productive.
   - We've had significant issues when merging.  Conflicts are not properly flagged and ""ghost"" code 
     (code that didn't exist in either branch) sometimes appear in the merge result.
   - The clients are very iffy.  Crashes are frequent, and the merge problems are related to 
     client-side bugs.
   - No one in the company is a fan of being required to 'check out' files to get them to be writable. 
     This is how perforce knows when files are modified and because there is no equivalent for new 
     files people frequently forget to add files and break the build.
   - It can only show you < 1000 files in a given changelist.  Big changes like that are when it's 
     most important to see what you're doing.  This is pretty common when doing branch integrations.
     When this happens you have to hit the ""auto-merge"" and hope for the best.
   - Branching/integrating isn't streamlined enough to really support every developer having their 
     own branch.  If it was dead-simple we could support a distributed development model with a 
     centralized server.
   - No real way to share code (for reviews, or collaboration) without going through the shared 
     depot.  We use p4tar, but it doesn't play nice with cygwin and has it's own problems.
   - No direct way to revert code.  Reverting is a 5 step process that isn't entirely obvious.

He says he would not recommend outsourcing to India, Pakistan, etc., but would consider outsourcing to a qualified firm closer to home.<p>This doesn't necessarily imply that he thinks developers in India and Pakistan are a bunch of dopes. In fact, it doesn't imply anything at all except that he prefers not to outsource overseas. We can really only speculate since he doesn't provide any reasons for his opinion, but maybe we should give him a little more credit here before we jump to conclusions and call the post offensive.<p>His opinions could be explained with a variety of reasons like time difference, difficulty in communicating (either long distance phone calls or having to do everything over email) or even possible language barriers. Sometimes when you need a very specific result you need to be careful how you explain this to someone whose native language is different from your own. Even common figures of speech can be taken literally and result in confusion over what is expected. All of these possible hurdles can be alleviated by working with a group closer to home.",1227622736

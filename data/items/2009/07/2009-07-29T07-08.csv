Part of the problem is that if you type an 'a' you always get the same three color triplet.<p>It seems to me that the simplest fix would be to add something like a seed value to the input or the triplet colors and then randomly generate the seed each time the page is loaded.  At that point someone replaying or recording the colors would have no idea what seed would have been generated, but as long as both fields use the same seed the color triplet would be identical for both.",1248854344

Yes, your customers will tell you what they want, but ultimately YOU decide the direction of your product/company.  In this sense, you most certainly are your own boss.<p>2. You won't like your personal life.
Unless you are passionate about what your business, and you love what you are building. Also, this is empirically and anecdotally wrong.<p>3. You won't succeed.
Every startup fails for one reason: the founders quit before they build something people like. There is no other reason for failure (esp. in the case of software). I will defend this point separately, if need be.<p>4. You'll hate the problems.
By definition, problems are problematic. But the problems you are trying to solve in YOUR business will be a lot more engaging than the trivial problems you are working on in a large company.<p>5.

11040193,comment,11037937,11037937,0,0,m0dest,,,"The key innovation in Windows Phone&#x27;s &quot;Continuum&quot; feature is that the desktop is just another view into the phone.  You can access the same exact apps and user data - browser, mail, calendar, messaging, etc. - and switch back and forth without losing state.  In that world, a phone with KVM support doesn&#x27;t just save you from owning a PC; it saves you from having to keep track of a different set of installed apps, setting up accounts, preferences, and state (currently open tabs, documents, etc.)<p>I&#x27;d welcome something like that for Android, especially as Google is experimenting with support for windowed Android apps with mouse support.<p>Unfortunately, Maru is not that.  It appears to only run X11 apps on the desktop, and only Android apps on the phone.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough value in that.  It has the inconveniences of needing to dock/undock your phone <i>plus</i> all of the hassle of having to maintain 2 separate sets of apps, settings, and state.",1454659198

It&#x27;s a third party music player and I use it full time since Apple Music was trying show up everywhere in the music.app<p>Ecoute uses the same library as the default app, shows a nice simple grid or list of your albums/artists/playlists and is well designed. When you use any controls in either app it will be picked up in both. It doesn&#x27;t matter in which app you start a playlist/play/pause/skip/whatever. With that in mind, using Ecoute as default app was as easy as replacing the icon in the dock.

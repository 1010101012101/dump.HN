Nice.<p>I don't know what kind of college your wife is attending, but it sounds suspiciously like a University-of-Phoenix-ish institution.

448495,comment,245227,245425,0,0,RobGR,,,"I don't think Apple's comeback (the OS-X based one) was miraculous.  They took a basic Unix that the Plan 9 guys would have turned their noses up at, and put a reasonable user interface on it and worked their way through all the tedious parts of making a stable, useful operating system; and then, it did exactly what the linux zealots had been saying was possible with Linux -- it became very popular, and known for being more stable, easier to use, and more secure than Windows.<p>The miracle is that Windows survived.  Given that Apple had a focus on hardware lock-in and the high end of the market, that left Windows a big hole to live in; Linux should have copied OS-X ""look and feel"" down to every detail, made it run even faster on cheaper hardware, and given Windows a run for it's money.<p>As one of those linux zealots, I intend this to be self-criticism.<p>Ubuntu is going to eventually do that, I think.  It is not OS-X compairable yet, but it is improving.",1232837420

But when programming in Scheme I find myself wanting monadic operations, like the seed in Oleg's SSAX parsers. But my code that rhymes with monads <i>requires</i> tail recursion, and the author didn't mention tail recursion at all.<p>I prefer to see monads as fold + tail recursion -- and without the latter, it seems you need the mutation that Common Lisp encourages.",1232836818

448485,comment,447435,447571,0,0,ruslan,,,"It's not about what you can or cannot build. It's about how you build it. For example, if you build a distrubuted system on unix or win32, the MPI API is almost the only way to go for you, which turns your code and entire application into complete mess. Whereas, Plan9 introduces a very different approach, which makes your code neat, lean and robust and you can dynamically add/remove nodes without rewriting and/or restarting your app.<p>I believe there will come some Linus Torvalds into Plan9 world who will revive the system and its ideas. From my point, Plan9 is ideal infrastructural solution for heavily loaded distributed web systems (AKA cloud networking) and other Web 2.0 stuff.<p>PS. pls don't mention Mosix.",1232836244

Thus more or less equal in potential power. There we seem to at least mostly agree.<p>I guess I was guessing that if people in the US didn't read newspapers they got at least some information from alternative sources. The ones I could quickly think of where all non-written, e.g. TV or youtube. Those would, in contrast to the written ones, generally not be as well suited for in depth analysis. My guess could, of course, be widely off.",1232835165

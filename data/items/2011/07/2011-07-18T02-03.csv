The purpose of the visit, to see if they want to give you a show, is known to both parties, but never explicitly stated. If the dealer doesn't want to give you a show, then you just had a nice visit where they gave you some feedback about your work. If they do want a show, obviously there's no problem. But the perils of saying ""Can I have a show?"" and getting rejected are avoided by the introduction of ambiguity.

While this is true of other non-real time communication mediums (like snail mail), that doesn't mean we shouldn't try solving it.<p>Improved spam detection increases the likelihood that an email will actually reach its intended recipient. In the 7 years I've been using gmail I've seen exactly one false positive (although there is some bias here as I've long since stopped checking my spam folder). But such technology has been slow to filter out to the less technically inclined ISPs and mail providers.<p>As far as actual verification, there are several ways to achieve this now. A popular technique is embedding a 1x1 pixel image with a unique id in its url. Unfortunately this is frequently abused by spammers looking for verification that an email address is good, so many email readers block images by default.<p>Any real solution is going to require some sort of trust mechanism or better make the procedure opt-in.

He <i>is</i> a coward. He comes out and plainly says that it's in his best interest to go along with the incentive structure in front of him instead of standing up for academic integrity.<p>Let's not let the cultural politeness here get in the way of calling it like it is. ""Coward"" may be a strong word, but it sometimes does apply.",1310955404

2774860,comment,2774254,2774743,1,0,justin_vanw,,,"I realize you are trying to maximize the quality of education you are providing.  I don't think you can use that as an argument against failing students who blatantly cheat.<p>There's not an easy solution, obviously.  You are taking a risk when you do something that some other members of your faculty are not doing.  You must realize, they are threatened by your attempt to prevent cheating, because it will become obvious very quickly when you find such high rates of cheating and deal with them appropriately, that they are not doing so.  That will raise difficult questions, deans will notice.  I think you might find, to your surprise, that there are many other people in the same position as you, but perhaps not as bold as you are. I would wager that that many, many other faculty members hate cheating as much as you, and are disgusted by the blatant plagiarism, but also like you are pressured by the current state of affairs to bury it.<p>I would encourage you to stick to your original guns, and keep grinding cheaters out of your class.  First of all, your reputation will be established very quickly among students.  Students who know they have to cheat will avoid you every semester, saddling other professors who are softer on cheating with worse students, and concentrating the best students into your classes.  More to the point, students won't try to cheat in your class nearly as much once your reputation is established, so the amount of time you have to deal with it will, I suspect, go down dramatically.<p>Edit:  This is way more congenial than how I actually feel.  It's your responsibility, and every other faculty member's, to identify cheating and run those students out of the university.  They are stealing from the students who are trying hard and mastering the material, by graduating uneducated and unprepared.  When they go out and embarrass themselves, it reflects on every other student with that same university's name on their diploma.<p>As for the girl crying for 2 hours, who cares?  Let her cheating ass go cry in her dorm, I think you have very weird priorities to let her waste your entire office hours (with honest students waiting) with her obvious, transparent attempt to manipulate you emotionally.",1310955268

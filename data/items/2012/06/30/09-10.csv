For example, you get typesafe URLs so that if you have a standard query like myapp.com/person/345 you can't mistakenly misuse 345 as an article id. Every input string is tracked by the type system so the possibility for escape issues, injection attacks or cross site scripting exploits to sneak in is minimal. Static types also make sure that internal links can not be broken - if for example you decide to change the above URL to myapp.com/getperson instead, your application won't compile until you've fixed every other part that still references the old link .../person, and so on.<p>Not to mention the (also type safe) dead easy to use persistence framework.<p>I'm still in the process of evaluating different solutions for my next web project but so far I'm pretty sure this is gonna be my go-to framework in the future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.yesodweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yesodweb.com</a>",1341049406

Money is information. That's all it is. Who owes what to whom.<p>So we could have a giant centralized computer system that tracks everyone's move. If we want a car, the computer could tell us how much we would have to work and serve society in order to deserve that car.<p>Now if we want to live in a somewhat free society, we obviously don't want to be tracked that way. In a free society, there will be different concepts to approach the money-as-information idea, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and people would choose freely what to use.<p>For example, there is Ripple: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_monetary_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_monetary_system</a> , a peer-to-peer credit system.

Also some seem to be concerned that it might destroy friendships. ;)<p>Bitcoin's approach is different.

They did it again with the iPad -- a product class around since 2000, and pushed by Microsoft in 2002.  In the past, they absolutely shaped the personal computer.<p>I am not currently purchasing new Apple products (Asus and Samsung are almost all my hardware), but I won't claim they aren't an innovator.  When I look at the SIII, I am happy apple helped shape the market into something beautiful.  I am also happy that Apple often pushes or drops new technology first...<p>That I said, I have absolute nightmares of a market where Apple wins and is able to really effectively drive out competitors.  I only enjoy Apple for its side-effects not direct-effects.  I hope that other companies (Microsoft, Samsung, Ubuntu) learn a bit from Apple, and grow some balls and try bold things.",1341047682

When people are scared of being blamed for things, and potentially also fired with little prospect of re-employment, then they just stick very rigidly to whatever they believe their job description to be, and never seek to explore new possibilities.  The classic phrase is ""it's more than my job's worth"".<p>In a culture of blame anything new or different is seen as bad, and to be avoided at all costs, because the unknown nature of the new might also bring blame with it.",1341047235

PHP has all the tools available to allow you to build anything <i>within a certain problem domain</i>, i.e. web programming. If you start with it, your focus will be shifted towards that domain. I think a better idea is to start with something more general-purpose, more consistent, get a good foundation, and then look at all the available options and say ""ok, now I want to work in this field"".<p>>  I don't like to see people who never got beyond the newbie level criticize something<p>It is true that I don't have 10 years of experience in php, but I don't see why I should have continued investing valuable time into learning this platform when there were clearly better options available.<p>>  not understanding how stings and numbers are equated etc<p>I understand it. I just think it's a bad decision to do it that way. Also note how all of your examples with other languages have reasonable logical explanations.

I'm only going to say the things I don't like because I'm wasting your time if I only say the things I do like (If I don't mention it, assume its awesome and pat yourself on the back for it, because overall you did a great job). You've obviously got a cool concept thats headed in the right direction, but the design needs some tweaks.<p>Make the nav bar smaller. I'd go 60px at max for the topbar. Also less white border on the bottom. 1-2px max there. Scale back the shadow on the bar as well, too much shadow says ""I just learned how to use shadow"". With drop shadow less is more. My rule of thumb is if you notice the shadow, its too much. You obviously want it to be there to add depth, but you don't want it to be distracting. While your at it, scale the shadow back on the screenshot and other bars as well. Again, less is more. Take a look at apple.com for a good, subtle use of shadows. (I'd even go less opacity than they do, but thats just me)<p>Green buttons get a bad rep for some sort of psychological connection with spending money. Don't know if thats voodoo web development or not, but I tend to stay away from them.<p>New money bag icon.<p>The footer is too tall. Make it only as big as it needs to be.",1341046941

I might be wrong, but as far as I know there are only a few bigger websites that put out their code (such as reddit if I'm not mistaking).<p>Secondly, to fix a problem with the skills we are trying to use(web development mostly) you need to host it, launch it and then maintain and manage the site. While getting what we build up and running would not be too big a problem, neither of us would have the time to invest in maintaining and managing the site. Therefore, we thought that it would be more beneficial to help someone with their backlog.<p>So, to sum it up, we thought of this more along the lines of: ""hey, you know that thing that you have been thinking of building, but have been putting it off for months? pitch it to us and we'll make it for you"".",1341046864

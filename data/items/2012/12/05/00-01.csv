4874279,comment,4872851,4873101,2,0,brc,,,"This is true of life for many people, not just online, though online tends to bring out the worst in people, in the same way that rolled-up car windows bring out more agression in people than, say, a bicycle would.<p>Ultimately snipping off the points where the rage is surfacing won't solve the problem.  You might think that because you don't rant on twitter it is case closed, but in reality it's probably still there, looking for a way to get out.<p>Online tools allow so much of our traits to escape because they are instant, easy and somewhat detached if not outright anonymous.  But if the underlying rage is still there, you'll find yourself with road rage, footpath rage, the list will go on.  Until you can get zen about things, it will just continue.<p>The key is to re-center your life, focus on what you can achieve and change and release the things you can't.  Many words have been written about this in many different contexts, but I prefer the Steven Covey (7 habits) definition of circle of influence, and circle of concern.   If you let your circle of concern develop into a larger set than your circle of influence, then you'll be conflicted at your inability to change things, and become less effective as a result.  And you'll find yourself raging at people with different political opinions, different life outlooks, people who are outside of your control.<p>I'm definitely not a religious person or one prone to quoting scripture, but I think there is a christian prayer which goes along the lines of 'grant me the wisdom to accept the things I cannot change, and the ability to change the things I can, and the wisdown to tell the difference'.  OR something like that.  I think its in the AA steps.<p>I would be surprised if all major religions don't have something along the same lines.<p>TLDR/ chill out more, and let things slide.",1354668971

It took a solid 2 weeks to get the bag, which is what I would expect. The cost to ship expedited versus the labour cost is a wash, especially considering they stil had to post the bag to me anyways.<p>- The goods in-store are still marketed as premium goods; to use an HN appropriate analogy, this is like me telling you that your Mac is crap because you bought from a 3rd party retailer. For reference, this was $150 for a laptop messenger bag. Not a ton of money, but not cheap considering there's no leather, etc involved.<p>- If you look at the store I mentioned, they're not really big-box. They're in some awkward in-between yuppie place where everything is greenwashed. I still shop there, but I'm pretty disenchanted since this incident.<p>- This event has, in my mind, destroyed whatever brand recognition they had. The product is alright, but I'd rather support a company that does everything in NA.<p>The point being, the market're selling into would be more than willing to absorb the cost of local production. I suspect at a point during their growth they were unable to afford to scale up locally, and decided to contract volume manufacturing for the channel. Now that they're well established, I would hope that they would perform an exercise like the one in this article, and see if moving production back makes sense.",1354668817

4874246,comment,4871994,4873294,2,0,neonkiwi,,,"I was curious about statistics regarding devices 'in the field,' and all I could find were these figures from Google such as the ones you cite (55% on Gingerbread, 15% pre-Gingerbread), which I think should be tied to a very important measuring detailthey are percentages of Android OS versions hitting the Play Store during a two week period.<p>I think this is a deliberate choice of reporting statistic to make the Android device world look more modern. They could report on a number of other metrics[0], but from my observation, non-power users aren't frequenting app storesperhaps they'll download apps a few times when the device is new, but after a while their phone is as customized as it's going to get. This issue is likely compounded after a few times of hearing about some app to try, and finding that it doesn't run on the dated OS.<p>Basically, I think there are loads of older Android installs in the wild, whose owners aren't going to the Play Store as often as people who just bought a new phone or tablet.<p>[0] I think something like access to Gmail via Android would be a better representation of the real market, and that figure is likely measured within Google. If not, it could be. I doubt the numbers would be very flattering... even the Play Store access metrics aren't so great to begin with.",1354668281

4874242,comment,4873311,4873967,5,0,Steko,,,"> Disney could (should) be most profitable when they make access to their product (content) easier.<p>Ok I'll bite.  Access to content has multiple facets:<p>First main point is price.  Obviously it's not ""most profitable"" for Disney to make it's stuff free.  A subscription service is going to charge a monthly fee and that fee is going to be primarily licensing and overhead.  Dividing that over a dozen companies reduces the profit taking of a market leader like Netflix but also multiplies the overhead. Note, the 3 year contracts already control Netflix from taking too much of the profits so it seems like there is little incentive for Disney to want a market of say 10 netflixes over one.<p>Second main point is that not all access is equal.  Disney has strong incentives to associate its content with:  (1) a quality service both in delivery and interface; (2) a service that provides useful data back to Disney; (3) a service that will promote Disney.  Why should Disney associate itself with your fly by night terribly performing service that streams in 360p, constantly drops and has a 15 step sign up process riddled with malware carrying flash ads?  Why should Disney help me launch a foreign film centric service where Disney movies are also rans?",1354668224

I know people who work for Bank of America and IBM and they have never been to the office.  Those companies have tens of thousands of employees, and the math just makes sense for them.  Each remote employee is money saved on office space, parking passes, pots of coffee, etc.<p>For smaller companies, it seems to be harder to accept telecommuting.  It could be that in smaller companies, the focus is growth, which is often aided by the type of face-to-face collaboration you get from having everyone in the office.  Or it could be that bosses just don't trust what they can't see, and in smaller companies, they are in a better position to regulate it.<p>The strange part is, I am many times more productive working from home than in the office, and I have demonstrated it on many occasions at multiple companies.  Sometimes I can get a whole week's work done in a few hours at home.  Other times I sit in the office and surf the 'net all day, not getting any work done.  The bosses have never complained when they catch people goofing off at work, as long as they put in a full day, but they are always suspicious of people who work from home, requesting email updates throughout the day.",1354666680

Assuming you have another point on your API that provides more resources from this _thing_ (resources that are so numerous you would not provide on the previous point), you could include an href on each one of these objects.

Keep track of metrics like how much bandwidth someone has shared or used (somehow), and then allow providers to define a measure for who can share their connection based on those metrics.<p>For example, one provider might let anyone connect no matter what, while someone else might only let people who have shared their own connection connect.<p>Determining what to share and to whom is a hard question, and when there are upstream costs to the provider the balance seems like it would be hard to find. The yourkarma model is more or less a loss-leading strategy (we pay you in bandwidth to sign up new users) and it's hard to see that being sustainable long term for the user. It's not completely obvious if the 100mb is for <i>new</i> karma users connecting, or for <i>any</i> connection, but based on their help page[1] it seems to be only new users:<p><i>Why do I get extra bandwidth when I share my connection?<p>Every time another person uses Karma, our company grows a little bigger.

You'll get good service up to a certain amount (at or below 1gb by my experience), then you'll be throttled back to 1999 for the rest of your billing cycle.

The idea that you should just talk with people face to face is nothing new and you're not doing anything remarkable.<p>Generally I'd just ignore a post like this, but they seem to be increasing in frequency.",1354665804
4874080,comment,4865590,4867230,1,0,jessaustin,,,"Some people frame the gov't-vs-corp question as one of trust, which it certainly is. If we really thought about it, however, we might find that we're more motivated by the feeling (not the fact!) of agency. If you write lots of letters to your reps and attend lots of city council meetings, you probably feel more agency in dealing with the government. If you spend lots of money and change vendors often, you probably feel more agency in dealing with ""private"" corporations. Some of us might not experience much agency in our day-to-day lives, but still be tempted to choose one or both scenarios as a pleasant imaginative exercise.<p>I suspect that much of the agency we feel in our dealings with both of these groups is illusory, perhaps inspired by a conditioning to approve of the broad basket of behaviors they were going to exhibit anyway. Even more imaginary, however, may be the thought that a strong embedding in a peer-regulating group will give us more agency. Humans had that arrangement for thousands of years, but most recent (last few centuries anyway) changes in society have undermined it. Society is the sum of choices we all make, and we don't seem to be returning to the village green.",1354665801

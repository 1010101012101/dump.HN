And, honestly, once a startup reaches the scale where it has multiple hierarchies of management and engineering organization that requires formal training, it's not a startup anymore. It's a different kinda beast... small business perhaps.<p>Not saying informal training isn't useful, it's just not something you'd formalize at a small startup.",1273906650

The question investors must be asking is whether he can translate his obvious aptitude for community building into an arena that isn't absolute anarchy.<p>On a personal level, I'm tremendously pleased for moot. He's been running 4chan on credit cards and goodwill for longer than any sane person would bear. Closing /b/ might have made 4chan profitable or it might have killed the community stone dead. I don't know why moot didn't chase anon out of town and turn 4chan into a halfway legit community, but I think the world is all the better for it. I might be being silly, but I think anon will be a far more important figure in the history of the internet than any of us realise.",1273906327

It differentiates this project from Silverlight, JavaFX, and Flash for one thing.  But going as low-level as possible is a great way to start the platform and ensure that it's secure and free from cruft at the very bottom.

Considering that moot managed to build a well-known, high-traffic website before he was 20 is significant. The fact that it is sometimes controversial and has had run ins with the church of scientology and yet survived relatively unscathed is also somewhat in his favor, I think. Investors want to know whether you'll be committed to your vision, even through the hardships. Dealing with competitors who want nothing other than to see their success and your failure is probably a hell of a lot easier than dealing with scientology lawyers and fanatics trying to bring you down in any way possible.",1273904891

1349478,comment,1349261,1349329,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It's looking more and more like we are entering a new age of web/browser innovation. Google, Mozilla, Apple and sometimes Opera are in a browser arms race, each pumping up the speed and capabilities of html/css/javascript to heights not many people imagined they could go 5 or 10 years ago. And with stuff like native client and soon LLVM support I think we're going to see an explosion of innovation as people discover what's possible with the new web.<p>Long ago some crazy folks managed to cram most of the guts of a processor onto a single integrated circuit, allowing the creation of a crude yet functional general purpose computer with a single printed circuit board and a few commodity support components. This enabled the creation of ""personal"" computers that were cheap enough and small enough for nearly anyone to own. At first they were far, far less capable than the mainframes and mini-computers of the day, and written off by many professionals as merely toys. But the nature and simplicity of their construction as well as the expanded potential user and developer base enabled for a faster rate of evolution than old style computer systems. At first micro-computers could only run native code, then people started writing simple interpreters and compilers, then developers created command line operating systems, just as had happened for mainframe computers decades ago, the micro-computer was simply playing catch up. But micro-computer development caught up extraordinarily quickly, and then began to surpass mini-computers and mainframes (as the rate of evolution didn't change after having caught up). Mini-computers quickly died out as specialized micro-computers began to take over their old roles.<p>Will things be the same for the web? In 5 or 10 years will we see web based applications and games more advanced than photoshop, visual studio, and Halo today?",1273904480

I am in no way associated with google, and a quick Google of my username would have figured that.<p>From the quick skimming of the articles I did I saw several mentions on different places of debug versions. It is very plausible.<p>You may be paranoid, but if you had read any of the articles you would have seen that the cars channel hop 5 channels a second, and that they are constantly driving. All they are looking for is beacon information sent out by access points. Apparently this also captured a couple of packets of actual data that was not discarded by the computers in the Google cars because of a debug build (from what I have read, again that might be pure speculation, but makes sense).<p>That won't be enough time to even figure out if the user is using Google or not. Go grab an wifi antenna, a wireless networking card, your favourite Linux distribution and go wardriving. You will pick up the same information that Google picked up. Now, if from the small samples you did get you can determine where people are using Google and for what and can make it valid research, good on you, but I doubt you will get much more than the occasional URL, and if you are lucky that URL is a Google URL.",1273904463

And that&#x27;s not news.<p>Researchers simulated a 1Tb/s transfer rate within a 100Mhz channel. Shannon&#x27;s limit[1] explains how: set the noise term arbitrarily small, and your transfer rate can be arbitrarily large.<p>Bandwidth is popularly misunderstood to be some fixed range of spectrum, as if signals outside the range are attenuated to zero. But you can&#x27;t attenuate a signal to zero. &quot;Bandwidth&quot; is measured[2] as the range over which attenuation is less than (say) 3db.<p>If not for noise, you could utilize a limited-bandwidth channel as if it had infinite bandwidth merely by amplifying frequencies outside the range in the exact proportion they are attenuated.<p>But every real system has noise. Overcoming this noise is the challenge of high speed transfers.

9125848,comment,9125193,9125788,0,0,shawnee_,,,"There&#x27;s an even larger issue driving this problem:<p><i>As Table 1 shows, Infosys and Tata pay very low wages to their H-1B workers. The average wage for an H-1B employee at Infosys in FY13 was $70,882 and for Tata it was $65,565. Compare this to the average wage of a Computer Systems Analyst in Rosemead, CA (where SCE is located), which is $91,990 (according to the U.S. Department of Labor). That means Infosys and Tata save well over $20,000 per worker per year, by hiring an H-1B instead of a local U.S. worker earning the average wage. But at SCE specifically, the wage savings are much greater. </i><p>When the H-1B worker isn&#x27;t employed directly by the company seeking the &quot;savings&quot; (for example, Infosys or Tata), and instead is employed by a middleman outsourcing company, the worker is essentially a victim of double exploitation. In these situations, wages for the h1B workers become even more dismal.  The outsourcing company takes a huge cut of the workers&#x27; earnings (which are usually hourly and without benefits) and then uses threatening tactics to essentially &quot;scare&quot; these workers into outputting more in less time, without overtime, etc.<p>See also:  <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/03/176134694/Whos-Hiring-H1-B-Visa-Workers-Its-Not-Who-You-Might-Think"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/03/176134...</a>",1425178244

I think any \n> freelancer can whip up a page like nngroup.com and \n> present themselves as a consultant, or is there more \n> to it than just the surface?<p>> So essentially it&#x27;s a sales technique.<p>I&#x27;ve worked as a freelancer and with consultants and I think your problem is that you&#x27;re focusing on the website. These businesses receive Zero (0) inbounds from their websites. The reason why they even have a website is because, well, it&#x27;s 2015. It might be a window into how the business works but changing your freelance website to look like a consultancy would make no difference whatsoever.<p>What divides the two is their professional networks: where they find business, who they&#x27;re working for, and why. Freelancers try to drum up business by going to meetups, following up on weak leads (&quot;I hear Jim needs a new website&quot;) subcontracting through agencies. Their value proposition is that they do an hour&#x27;s work for an hours pay and they&#x27;re in business for themselves most likely cause they&#x27;re just trying to escape the cube farm.<p>A consultant got into her business because she&#x27;s realized that she&#x27;s reached the peak of what she can make as an &quot;individual contributor&quot;. She has a big book of business before she even hangs out her shingle and perhaps decided to start consulting because she had too many people wanting to give her money and didn&#x27;t want to commit to one. Her client list grows organically through referrals being made through her huge professional network. When she enters into sales negotiations the impetus is on the client to sale the gig to her rather than the other way around.<p>I would like to work for myself again but not as a freelancer. That&#x27;s a dead-end world. My goal now is to either develop my career to the point where I can be a proper consultant or (even better) develop a SaaS product.",1425178039

Why would anyone expect software they installed locally to need one? Thunderbird is a mail client, so why would they expect it to send data to anyone other than e-mails to their chosen recipients? And even if they knew the privacy policy existed, did anything suggest to them that they might want re-read that policy to find these changes when they were added? I assume the details were also on display in my local planning department in Alpha Centauri.<p>Incidentally, if you&#x27;re reading this and thinking that I&#x27;m naive and/or over-reacting, you might want to stop and consider the company you&#x27;re keeping. What other types of people use software that does things the user doesn&#x27;t expect, collect data without advertising it, and make arguments about implied consent, the relevant disclosure being available somewhere hardly anyone will ever look, or how it&#x27;s all done to improve the user&#x27;s experience somehow? How many of those people do most of us like?<p>In any case, from both a practical and probably a legal perspective, anything that is not actively presented to a user is the electronic version of small print <i>at best</i>. You can rationalise this as much as you like, but the facts are:<p>1. Thunderbird is phoning home.<p>2. The user is not informed of this explicitly.<p>3. The user is certainly not actively giving their consent.<p>4. This still appears to be the case even if the user has explicitly opted out of sending telemetry when the software was first installed.<p>IMHO, any such policy is indefensible in 2015 if you want to be taken seriously as an organisation that protects privacy. This particular behaviour may be a minor infraction, but it&#x27;s the general principle (and, frankly, your enthusiasm for defending it) that is of greater concern.<p>Edit:<p><i>the risk to the user of rogue plugins/extensions was and continues to be serious. (Plugins probably more than extensions; Thunderbird tends to pick-up all the plugins that Firefox would see and most adware/malware implementors seemed otherwise unconcerned with Thunderbird.)</i><p>WTF??!! Thunderbird is apparently automatically running a whole bunch of plug-ins that I only installed for Firefox and have long ago set (in Firefox) not to run automatically, or in some cases that I didn&#x27;t even voluntarily install at all. <i>None</i> of these things have any business being in any sort of e-mail client at all. When and how the [multiple expletives deleted] did this happen? I thought you (generic &#x27;you&#x27;) were concerned about someone installing an extension that had a buggy update and caused a hang on start-up or something.

Are they hiring for general talent, offering 200k a year with a nice private office?  Are they offering 100k, forcing people to work in a loud open office where everyone can see your screen, requiring that you live in SF where the median priced house is over a mil, and demanding immediate plug and play developer with a a very narrow specialty skill set?  I mean, they say they can&#x27;t hire, but doesn&#x27;t that mean they can&#x27;t hire at the price they think they should get to pay?<p>I do agree with you that one shouldn&#x27;t conclude a person isn&#x27;t high talented in software if he or she doesn&#x27;t have a grad degree.

9125799,comment,9123577,9125691,0,0,Jach,,,"The same way they currently work in a system everyone gets burned by? The main benefits of the current system from my perspective are that fraud detection algorithms are really good now, in the cases of credit card fraud the CC companies usually just credit back the stolen amount to the customer (which unfortunately hurts sellers since buyer fraud is still common), and when events like $300m-$900m getting stolen from banks happen, the overall system generates so much profit that it mostly gets swept under the rug and the average person isn&#x27;t hurt. (FDIC helps too.) Despite all these benefits, the elderly are still routinely scammed out of money. (Some reports suggest increasingly.)<p>I haven&#x27;t heard anything about outright bitcoin thefts from privately owned wallets with a password protecting them, but then again I don&#x27;t follow bitcoin too closely. The typical drama I hear is an exchange shutting down (why would the elderly have their btc on an exchange when their bank account funds aren&#x27;t on an exchange?) and occasionally someone&#x27;s unencrypted wallet backup on a compromised server being taken. There was also the issue with the android wallets a while back generating insecure keys. I&#x27;m not convinced the elderly would lose any more than they already do on average given they&#x27;re using bitcoin (which I think they&#x27;re fully capable of using if they&#x27;re already using online payment systems).

Problem is, you have to go through med school and run up that debt before you know if you&#x27;ll be getting one of those residencies.<p>While the article is positive about nursing and PA, I actually think the article underplays the possible compensation in these fields.

Is widely known that the Chavez government has been one of the most corrupt government in Venezuela history.<p>What do you think is going to happen to this gold when it gets to Venezuela? (If it ever gets there)<p>I mean, I don't know the dynamics of this, but which authority is going to weigh the incoming gold? Who are we supposed to trust when every institution in the country is in Chavez hands? They basically say what they are told.<p>Also, our Central Bank does not have the physical capacity to store that much gold. Chavez already offered the basement of the Presidential Palace :S (which I have been to and is as a regular basement can be).<p>What about the cost of moving that quantity of gold? They are already talking about 40 trips. Yeah, that's going to cost, 400 million according to the article.

The new government will have to deal with Russians and Chinese institutions under a different premise, because the new government will be or will try to be very close with the US.

2916007,comment,2914960,2915845,5,0,danssig,,,">I'd like a calm discussion, if possible.<p>You're both implying that poor people are lazy and confusing economics for a hard science.  The latter is annoying but the former is offensive.<p>>You aren't disagreeing that if an individual works more hours at any given job[1], all else equal, they will make more money.<p>Actually I absolutely disagree that working more hours at a job gives more money.  I've been a career software developer for 12 years now and for me it is the exact opposite.  The more I work, the less I make.  I don't claim that working less means more money but rather that any correlation between the two is largely coincidental.  The hardest working white collar workers I ever knew worked at the Walmart home office.  They were (and still are) also the worst paid I've ever worked with.<p>By what mechanism would a salaried worker make more by working more?  In my experience they either work more because the position requires it (i.e. it's expectation and you don't get performance raises for meeting expectations) or they are under the mis-impression that this will get them ahead.  Usually in the latter case, several people get this silly idea and start competing with each other pushing <i>team average</i> working hours up and thereby making each other mediocre again.  You can't give one guy a raise for working 12 hour days when the whole team is doing it.<p>From everything I've ever seen in my career; networking gets you ahead, not number of hours your butt is in a seat nor gallons of sweat you perspire.  If anything, these two things get in the way of networking.<p>>Also, I might have close to $0 in my bank account, but I don't really care that there are rich people out there and am not envious of them. It's enough for me that as I work harder, I will see the returns of my personal effort.<p>It doesn't bother you that since '79 middle/lower class wages (inflation adjusted) have remained relatively flat while the top tear have around 4 times more wealth? [1]  People who got rich by making their own business didn't hurt you, true, but that is a vanishingly small percentage of the wealthy.  The CEO's are making megabucks and laying you off instead of passing on part those profits to you (the worker).  As a workforce we've gotten vastly more efficient but most of the fruits of those labors are going to upper management.<p>>If instead one is really concerned about other people, then you've set yourself up for discontent, no matter how hard you work!<p>A good sentiment overall, but in this case not quite true.  Politics got us in this mess and good politics could get us out again.  Either that or if most of the workforce would just stop working for BigCorp Inc. and start their own small businesses, make a big Coop, whatever.<p>>You can focus on the cosmic injustice of this and make yourself unhappy, or you can do what you can to make your own life better.<p>You seem to have turned into an infomercial, but this touches on the whole point: what you can do to make your life better <i>is not</i> working harder.  There are a lot of things you can do, but hard work will have the lowest (if any) yield.  Networking will have the biggest effect if you're both lucky and good.<p>>Well, if you believe this premise then it's not possible to submit evidence supporting any position, either mine or yours.<p>I believe because it's not only true, it's obvious.  That doesn't mean we can't support positions it just means you can't come out and say ""see, it's the poor people's own fault, here's the proof"".  There is no ""proof"".  There is only faulty data and antidotes to build assumptions on.<p>>I do believe there is some objective truth out there.<p>There are experiences of real people.  Claiming something like ""salaries go up with hours worked"" just can't be proven conclusively any more than the weather man can tell you how much rain you will get on Tuesday, 3 months from now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tucsoncitizen.com/medicare/2011/02/24/the-rich-get-richer-while-average-americans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tucsoncitizen.com/medicare/2011/02/24/the-rich-get-ri...</a>",1314094120

I have persuaded my bosses to relocate me to NYC and they have agreed. Though the HR talks have not yet happened regarding salaries, i would like to prepare and set mine and their&#x27;s expectations.<p>After a lot of research on google/glassdoor/etc, i have come to the following conclusions:\n1. I might not get the best market salaries (Asian/NYC being high cost center/non native English speaker/first timer to USA/etc)\n2. I should range my salary expectations in a range of 130K-150K just to be safe in the zone and not miss out on the job. Is this fair?\n3. I have no option but to work in NYC and live in NJ. It seems that this is the sanest thing to do.\n4. Taxes being high compared in NYC, I can safely assume 40% of my salary being cut. So that leaves me in a range of 78K-90K after tax. Assuming my rental will be around 2k and monthly expenses around 1k, that would leave me with 42K-54K. This i believe should be more than enough.\n5. My life-work balance might go for a toss given that longer hours are the norm in NYC (Wall Street). Am i right?\n6. Given that i will be moving to USA on an L1 B visa? (not a senior management guy) i can apply for a GC (as in Green Card, not the other GC) as soon as i join and get it in around 2-3 years. Am i right?<p>My preparation for my move has not yet started and i am sure that i will have more questions. Since i have no one in USA (friends/family/etc) i am completely reliant on YC.<p>Please let me know on the above points and if any of my assumptions are wrong. Also please feel free to advice me on anything that you think would be a appropriate.<p>Warm regards from Hong Kong...",1376801234

6231628,comment,6229555,6229871,3,0,kafkaesque,,,"I just recommended someone on HN a book by Camus. <i>The First Man</i>.<p>I read your other comment about your having a troubled childhood. I can relate.<p>When I was 14 I started reading everything Camus ever published. I became very withdrawn. My family became very concerned. I wrote important phrases by Camus and stuck them on my wall. Pretty soon my entire wall had Camus phrases. My dad&#x27;s psychologist (and my family) recommended I should &#x27;explore&#x27; other types of literature. It was a very tough time. Except for me, I viewed my depression as crippling.<p>Yes, I was a very logical child, as yourself, but, as Camus suggests, viewing life as absurd leads to a very morose nihilism. I skipped school and was about to fail secondary school. I didn&#x27;t care. I didn&#x27;t excel at school, I excelled at philosophy, but that didn&#x27;t really matter in secondary.<p>Every single book I read by Camus influenced me and was a stab to the heart. He sometimes wrote on the troubling matter of adults not willing to understand adolescents, and I felt very much misunderstood. Plus, I was also torn between two cultures; one rooted in tradition and another which was very progressive.<p>The Myth of Sisyphus has references which might help to know or understand before jumping into it. The Stranger is definitely more accessible and, for obvious reasons, it is his most widely read book. But the protagonist in that book is a bit of a character study. I think at one point I related to him, but stopped saying so, because a lot of people interpret Meursault as a sociopath. I don&#x27;t think I was a sociopath, but was deeply confused about the world in which I lived and distanced/detached myself from everything to understand my world better. It&#x27;s hard to explain, especially here.<p>The First Man was the first book that ever made me cry. I never really knew my mother, and this book is about a boy named Jacques, and his relationship with his mother. It is also about a boy&#x27;s reservations about living in poverty, and living with a poor family (and everything that entails), which I got to experience very early in my life. But it is also a metaphor for cultures colliding: Spanish (which also happens to be my grandparents&#x27; culture) and a more &#x27;modern&#x27; one, French (in my case, English-speaking North American). Of course, it has Algerian references, as well.<p>I highly recommend Camus. For those who&#x27;ve never read him, I would recommend these, in this order:<p>A Happy Death<p>The Stranger<p>The First Man<p>Exile and the Kingdom<p>Resistance, Rebellion, and Death<p>I would place The First Man first, but it is a very different book from everything else Camus has written (except his diaries, I guess).

The reason this piece is so bizarre is that the sorts of traits that allow you to build great fortunes in business[1] are anti-correlated with those that result in becoming a tattooed, drunk, abusive, morbidly obese, criminally-inclined drug addict. Put another way, the kind of guy who would build up a fortune like that would be unlikely to have a biological son like this. In America we&#x27;re supposed to pretend that DNA doesn&#x27;t matter, and that you can only pass down looks/height and not brains/behavior, but reality doesn&#x27;t work like that [2,3,4]. Babies put up for adoption at birth in particular tend to disproportionately be children of parents with low impulse control and mental disorders, and at least some of that appears to be due to the genetics of the parents above and beyond the orphanage conditions [5].

6231602,comment,6229512,6231433,1,0,dnautics,,,"I guess I&#x27;m uncomfortable using taxes to pay for stuff (especially overfunding) that will be mostly crap.  Taxes, because if you don&#x27;t pay for them, you go to jail, should be subject to a particularly strong level of accountability[0], and &quot;we don&#x27;t know what is going to be useful&quot; is just really a recipe for spending abuse.<p>Peer review is one thing (and it looks like it&#x27;s going to be getting better)...  But reviews for funding - that&#x27;s really tricky.  How do you select whom to review science?  In our current system, you wind up with program administrators (people who advocate and shepherd funding projects) who are mostly[1] people who &#x27;couldn&#x27;t make it in science&#x27;.  So you get effectively second-rate-intelligence fanboys and fangirls who get paid six figures to fawn over the scientists with the biggest mouths and most outlandish claims.  To actually conduct the reviews, typically PIs are hired (in a secreted process[2]), so there&#x27;s of course a level of cronyism involved - not to mention how PIs are generally clueless for other structural reasons.  It is hard to believe that this system is efficient or effective at being a good steward of the public trust.<p>[0] Science is not by far the worst area where government excels at failing to be accountable, but I also see no reason to increase our investment in a system that isn&#x27;t working.<p>[1] I know one program administrator who isn&#x27;t incomptent, she&#x27;s my ex-boss; the reasons why she wound up as a program administrator are rather complicated <i>and</i> everyone hates her because she isn&#x27;t interested in doing things the usual way.  My neighbor growing up - who introduced me to science - was a physics administrator was probably also not incompetent, but I don&#x27;t really know.<p>[2] by which I mean the process is not secret, but the actual goings on are, i.e. you don&#x27;t know who reviewed you etc.",1376798608

With that said, if you build a reactor that doesn&#x27;t need to moderate the neutrons and slow them down you could use nothing but plutonium as a fuel.  But why bother, LEU is just fine and you cant make a bomb with it.  Whereas plutonium is a proliferation hazard and much more expensive.",1376798527

True, it would probably discover another couple thousand planets, but Kepler has already done that once.  What&#x27;s another factor of two in the number of known planets?<p>Kepler looks off the plane of the Galaxy at stars that are typically several kiloparsecs away.  In other words, we are never going to visit these worlds.  Now that Kepler has revealed that planets are common, it will be much more interesting to find nearby planets that we have a better chance of characterizing, seding probes to, or even visiting one day.<p>This is what TESS will do: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Sat...</a>",1376798526
6231598,comment,6230355,6231543,4,0,lutusp,,,"I&#x27;m a former NASA design engineer. Reaction wheels are a real weak point in spacecraft design. They basically allow one to accurately point an observing spacecraft, but without using propellant.<p>If you use propellant, you eventually run out and the mission is over. With electric-motor reaction wheels (a minimum of three), you can keep them going with solar energy. So in principle, they&#x27;re a big improvement over the alternatives.<p>The problem is that they&#x27;re constantly in motion -- constantly. If you turn a spacecraft and bring it to a new stable position, that new position must be maintained by constant reaction wheel motion. So they&#x27;re essentially running all the time, there&#x27;s constant friction, and their parts and bearings eventually wear out.<p>> Seems like either a more durable item or some sort of cartridge system where you can have like 20 spares ready to go, eject one and slot in a new one or something.<p>You&#x27;re overlooking something. To turn a spacecraft like Hubble or Kepler in a reasonable time, you must either have a massive reaction wheel, or you need to make it spin fast (it&#x27;s all about momentum). Typical reaction wheels represent a compromise between mass and rotational speed. If you want to reduce frictional wear, you make them bigger, more massive, which increases the mission cost. If you need to reduce the size and mass of the spacecraft, you make the wheels spin faster, and they wear out sooner.<p>So solving the problem by adding more reaction wheels is a non-starter -- they&#x27;re too physically large and massive to just add a lot of spares.",1376798519

For a lot of the scenarios you describe it would suffice to have a fleet of planes that take off, fly, land, resupply and take off again completely autonomously.",1205052369

That doesn't mean stop altogether, of course, but it may mean giving one thing up for another.",1205052316

Are you sure mnesia:dirty_update_counter/3 doesn't work for your needs?<p>As for ids in mnesia, you aren't (realistically) at risk of overflowing an integer storage size since you get automatic promotion to bignums.  {node(), now()} works fine if you are working in a distributed context and don't need sequential IDs.  Also erlang:md5/1, or crypto:sha/1 can give you unique IDs to use over distributed nodes.  I wouldn't recommend erlang:phash2 because it only yields 27 bit to 32 bit hashes.<p>I'm not sure what good term_to_binary would be if you are keeping everything in mnesia.<p>I would recommend looking into mnesia:dirty_update_counter/3 first and then expand to either {node(), now()} or erlang:md5/1 or crypto:sha/1 if you find updating the counter at distributed nodes is a problem.",1205050650

132409,comment,132328,132364,0,0,cawel,,,"Slate.com had an interesting article on this topic of Web 2.0 democracy: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2184487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2184487</a> And it went in the same direction as this Newsweek article: debunking the myth that <i>most of the users</i> are contributing to Digg or Wikipedia, in their respective community, as implied by the Web 2.0 democracy concept. Rather, ""At both Digg and Wikipedia, small groups of users have outsized authority."" (Slate.com)<p>Think about the tight moderation at Slashdot given to a selected few, or the 1% at Wikipedia. Most of Wikipedia edits are not done by 100%, not 50%, but only 1% of their users. As a result, one cannot call it a web 2.0 <i>participative</i> democracy. And I think that's the message from both Newsweek and Slate.<p>Of course Newsweek ""wish[es]"" the experts had more eyeballs/attention, since that's their business, to be news experts. But while user-generated content is certainly not ""out"" (that's probably exaggerated wording to catch the eye), the point is that there is a desirable need to have those experts (or in other words a kind of elite) in order to have quality content.",1205050490

How has the content of their jobs changed in the last 10-20 years compared to software development. As a firm grows less of the total headcount is in engineering, attacking these functions might yield more productivity improvement. You have yet to answer my status quo question: what is the baseline for your 10X comparison?",1205050264
132407,comment,132268,132404,0,0,webwright,,,"That's a great point-- one of the recurring themes we hear from speakers at YC is ""you can't underestimate the importance of distribution"".<p>That being said, I'm always a fan of nailing the most important distribution tool there is-- word of mouth-- before focusing too much on anything else.  If you can't tell 10 people about it and have them be excited enough about your product to tell a few more, then distribution is really just pouring water into a leaky bucket.<p>Facebook apps are a fine example of distribution-mania that ventures into the realm of unhealthy.  Turns out, no one really wants a lot of those apps-- so their active userbases are dramatically declining.",1205049983

People seem to just be curious, it just seems critical to the story.<p>2. What were these gamers doing to your business?  What specific things were they doing to circumvent your revenue model?  I notice promotion codes were passed around in that chat you posted a picture of - how did you get that picture?  Are they doing anything else to avoid paying for your service?<p>3. When did this happen/what is the timeframe for this?  The tweet happened, and then after what period of time did your user influx happen?  How long did it take before they became problematic?<p>4. Where was your interaction with them taking place?  Email?  Does your website have a tool for live interaction with your customers?  What frequency were you interacting with the gamers vs. your &quot;real&quot; customers?<p>4. Why do you think they felt the need to treat your business so poorly?  Do you think their general entitlement attitude is based on using generally large-scale products, products which don&#x27;t get impacted quite as negatively by their behavior?<p>6. How are you dealing with this?  You mention straight-up blocking these problem users, and in these comments you talk a bit about how you determine they&#x27;re gamers, but could you elaborate on this?  I think it&#x27;s pretty clever that you&#x27;re looking at bio data from Twitter, but are you doing anything else?",1375811945

Having worked at a mega-sized corporation, I definitely felt like there was a serious need to revamp/rethink the current command and control system. Most employees feel disconnected from the decisions made by the management and the managers have hard time earning the buy-ins from their employees. I actually entertained the thought about building a thriving company without central management, with every employee empowered to make their own decisions (also take the responsibilities for them as well). I asked that question to the founder of Hoovers.com at a guest lecture. His answer was, based on his experience, pretty strong no. Most successful companies of our current time are represented by strong leaders, take Apple with Steve Jobs. But Apple will not stay Apple after Steve Jobs. A great company cannot last after the strong leader/founder leaves the company. Can we create a sustainable success with great PEOPLE instead of a single leader? I think Holacracy seems to be a promising solution and I would like to see this system stands the test of time.",1375811805

My two main points:<p>1) A difference in scope means a difference in kind. Using a service such as KeysDuplicated (formerly Shoosl[1]) from your mobile phone enables opportunities. These opportunities break previous assumptions in the security threat model but can also lead to new business opportunities (see for instance Prim[2] - a laundry service that will come into your home if you send them a photo of your key; they will then find and do your laundry.)<p>2) The huge missing element here, which has been a necessity in computer security for years, is monitoring. For many, many people, replacing the lock or installing an alarm may not be an option. My company makes a device that fits over your lock and alerts you when someone uses a key (or bumps your door, or comes in without your permission, etc)[3]. It also allows you to grant virtual keys to actuate the lock - enabling use cases like Prim without having to fabricate a physical, non-revocable access token.<p>[1] <a href=""http://keysduplicated.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keysduplicated.com/</a>

The competitive advantage of software is that you only have to build it once. (And, if it&#x27;s well-written, it costs as little to maintain as possible.) Then you sell it as many times as you can. That&#x27;s what our professional pursuit of &quot;scalability&quot; is really about: The more &quot;scalable&quot; the product, the less time a company needs to spend worrying about how much work the software can do and the more time the company spends trying to convince people to give the software more things to do. The ideal software company would spend 100% of its time thinking about sales and customer satisfaction and 0% of its time thinking about software.<p>If you or your peers are noticing sales happening more often, it may be because you&#x27;re becoming more aware of how the software business actually works. You&#x27;ll need to figure out how to cope with this knowledge. You can choose to embrace it. Or you can choose to avoid working in the software business, which is easy to do. (Most programming jobs are not part of the software business, and even those that are often have nothing to do with the strategic side of the business. Though, I have to warn you, once you&#x27;ve learned to see the strategic side of the software business it is hard to un-see. And the power to change the real world at scale is addictive and is not lightly discarded.)",1375811410

How can this be regarded as a workable system?<p>The fact remains that at any given moment, there&#x27;s a single set of policies that apply universally within society.  The likely ephemeral nature of the current policy equilibrium has no bearing on the fact that the nature of the system eliminates all possibility of &quot;agreeing to disagree&quot;.<p>In a system where all social questions are political ones, and all political questions are addressed as universals, there&#x27;s no alternative to all-encompassing political conflict.  Every divergence in values or priorities serves as the basis for an all-or-nothing struggle, that invariably spills over into the rest of society, and corrupts our social relations to the point that every other institution and community in society becomes polluted by political acrimony, even in contexts where the political state has no legitimate role.  The so-called &quot;culture war&quot; in modern American society is a clear example of this.<p>> How is this not the case in a democracy?<p>It is the case in a substantive democracy, where clear boundaries are indeed drawn between distinct social context and institutions, and in which the state is properly regarded as a single institution within society, and not a unified expression of the whole.<p>Where those boundaries are blurred, and the political state is equated with society as a whole, substantive pluralism is diminished, and authority becomes concentrated in the institution of the state.<p>> Pluralism comes from the liberal doctrine of individualism; it&#x27;s a natural consequence of asserting the individual worthiness and dignity, which demands that the individual&#x27;s concerns be considered in some fashion.<p>No, real pluralism  doesn&#x27;t come from some vague notion that &quot;individual&#x27;s concerns be considered in some fashion&quot;, by some unstated but presumptively singular authority.<p>It comes from the recognition of the fact that society <i>is</i> the patterns of interaction that exist among individuals who assert their own agency, in pursuit of their own purposes, in undertaking relations with others, and that in doing so, they <i>create</i> a great plurality of autonomous communities and institutions, and maintain the inherent right to define the nature of those communities and institutions without making reference to putative universals promulgated by external third parties.<p>> Making a false distinction between state and society is useful only for disempowering citizens who see themselves as part of one but not the other<p>Asserting a false equivalency between society at large and the state in particular is useful only for disempowering citizens, who learn to outsource responsibility for their particular circumstances to external institutions and vague abstractions, instead of applying their own initiative, in concert with others, within the context of the substantive institutions and communities that they inhabit.<p>> Why do we rely so heavily on the fourth estate to speak on our behalf?<p><i>You</i> might, but <i>we</i> don&#x27;t.<p>> Why are we ourselves not speaking?<p>What is this obsession with <i>talking</i>, anyway.

6167977,comment,6167746,6167746,4,0,codegeek,,,"First, congratulations!! I can give you a few important things to keep in mind (just had a baby..well 5 months now)<p>- Prepare for delivery at a hospital that you are comfortable with. Go take a maternity tour by arranging one in advance. This way, you know where to go exactly when the day comes without any confusions. The guided tours are usually pretty good and they show you the Labor Delivery and Post Partem rooms. Since you are a couple of months away, I hope you have already done this. If not, do it asap<p>- Buy an infant car seat or borrow one from your family/friends if you can. We use Graco brand for our baby and highly recommend it. For infants, you need a rear facing car seat. This link can give you ideas. [1]<p>- Make sure you get the car seat in advance and learn how to install it in your car. Depending on car models, it could be different. In more recent years, cars usually have a child seat hook/harness that you can attach the seat to. Look for it and make sure you practice. Note: Some hospitals are very strict on how the newborn is taken out in a carseat and will supervise you as well.<p>- Depending on the season, ensure you have proper clothes ready for the baby. Cold or warm, prepare accordingly. Our baby was born in March and it was very cold (eastcost). So we prepared accordingly with baby blankets etc on top of the clothes. Shop around for newborn clothes [2]<p>- Strollers, we use Graco again and works really good for us. [3]<p>- Get a pediatrician for the baby. Usually, the hospital will ask you if you already have one. If not, then they will assign you one during the delivery but if possible, get one beforehand so that you baby can be seen by the same during delivery and afterwards.<p>- Diapers and wipes. These will be big items for you to buy all the time. We use Pampers swaddlers diapers. It has wetness indicator (yellow turns blue if diaper is wet). You will probably start witha  size 1 for newborn and slowly move to bigger sizes. For wipes, we use Pampers sensitive wipes. [7] [8]<p>- Breast milk and pumping: If the mother decides to pump which we found out to be easier for us, get a breast pump. Sometimes, your insurance can pay for it. I think Obamacare has the provision. So you might get it for free or very cheap.<p>- Formula: Depending on your individual case, you will use formula in addition to breast milk if any. For formula, we use Similac Advance Early shield. It comes as powder or liquid. Powder is cheaper but you need to do additional work to mix it with warm water. I suggest keep both because for travelling, the liquid one is handy while at home, you can use the cheaper powder option [4] [5]<p>- Bottles. Go to a local babiesrus and take a look. We use these [6]. Nipple type and size matters as well. Talk to some friends/family to get an idea.<p>- Buy a crib. Dont go for sometjhing too fancy in my opinion. Just get one that works for your baby. You will see 4-in-1 convertibles etc. Explore and see what works for your baby<p>- Buy a swing. We found it easier to put our newborn to sleep if she was cranky. Sometimes, they dont like to lie in a crib but the swings helps (with light white noise/music). It was very useful to us for first 3 months. our baby outgrew it afterwards though:)<p>- Use <a href=""http://www.babycenter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.babycenter.com</a> and even add your email for updates. They have the best tips, articles and even track your progress throughout including post delivery.<p>- Many more I am sure. But these will give you some insights.

We&#x27;ve been able to reproduce keys, even fairly complex ones, well before 3D printers came along. Get a clean enough impression/scan/photograph and we can make it happen, perhaps 3D printing is seen as making it more accessible to the general population.<p>I&#x27;m about to go on a whole thing here, so let me first say that I am excited about their work and I have personally been pushing for years to see more high security key printing happening (see Nirav Patel&#x27;s Abus Plus key printing[0])<p>What I take umbrage with is the idea that this development is going to be the death of mechanical locks. Even the suggestion that it _should_ be the death of mechanical locks. In the Forbes article [1] One of the students behind this work suggested that his goal was the elimination of mechanical locks:<p>&quot;If we show that mechanical locks are vulnerable to key duplication just by having a handful of numbers you can download off the internet, hopefully they&#x27;ll be phased out more quickly,&quot; says Van Albert.<p>What this fails to address is that the cuts on your key are supposed to be a secret, and your behavior toward your keys should be the same as your behavior toward a password. You don&#x27;t pass it around and you are very careful about who you trust it with.<p>I also dislike the characterization of the discovery of the &quot;numbers&quot; in the main and sidebar bittings. That information has been publicly available and the suggestion that they &quot;reverse-engineered&quot; (from their abstract submitted to defcon)[2] the lock is a bit dramatic. Better, I think, to say that they &quot;read the documentation.&quot;<p>Obviously I have a chip on my shoulder when it comes to mechanical security, but I am confident saying that any call for the blanket abolition of mechanical locks is short-sighted and narrow-minded. This could have been an amazing opportunity to address human behavior as it relates to mechanical security, but instead it was wasted on the age-old call for the death of locks.

And the bike that was stable with no trail and no gyroscopic effects used this to provide stability; the stability was provided because the fork, with the lower center of gravity, would fall faster than the frame (taller inverted pendulums fall slower than shorter ones, which you can easily demonstrate by how much easier it is to balance a long object like a shovel than a short object like a spoon on your hand). This provided the necessary feedback that caused it to steer into a turn in a way that stabilized.<p>The takeaway is that there are several factors which influence the stability of a bike. We know of certain designs which utilize one or more of these factors to achieve self-stability (and the conventional bike has all of these factors, hence why it tends to work so well), but we don&#x27;t know the exact set of conditions on the combination of factors which would allow you to characterize which designs are stable versus unstable, without simply trying out any given design and simulating it.",1375809890

6167842,comment,6166808,6166808,76,0,grellas,,,"Many may be unfamiliar with how legal billing practices have evolved over the past years in the U.S. At the risk of boring people, I&#x27;ll try to sum it up as I understand it. It does have some interesting aspects.<p>In the days when law was more a &quot;profession&quot; than a business, blue-chip clients would pay the bills of blue-chip firms based on, e.g., a $50K invoice that said &quot;For services rendered.&quot; In a typical case, no further explanation given and none requested. This probably was a vestige of the &quot;old boy&#x27;s network&quot; by which top lawyers and top executives came from a similar elite pedigree and it was regarded as undignified to question professionals about the mysteries of how they worked their craft. (This goes back before my time but I have it on good authority from senior partners with whom I worked circa 1980 in prestige firms).<p>That represented billing at the elite level of law. In the mundane, everyday practice of law, the common practice in billing was indeed that of fixed-fee services. In pre-Silicon Valley days of Santa Clara County in the 1950s, for example, sole practitioners would bill for basic services based on a fee schedule put out by the local bar association (e.g., &quot;Preparation of will - $400&quot;). Those were the days when local bar associations held much more sway than they do today and, in order to practice, a local lawyer had to do such things as sign up to represent criminal defendants in murder cases as part of an obligatory process (these were the days before the Supreme Court rulings made the right to counsel in capital cases a much more involved process than it is was back then). In any case, it was the courts that caused time-based billing to be foisted on clients as a matter of routine when they struck down the local bar fee schedules as illegal price-fixing.<p>The pattern above is pretty evident: in all cases, lawyers as professionals were seen as part of a closed network by which they themselves set the rules that everyone else simply had to accept. In billing, that meant that lawyers billed as they deemed fit without much scrutiny and without much explanation.<p>The scale of law was also very different then: back in that day, a prestige law firm in San Francisco, for instance, might have 20 to 25 lawyers at the most. The work it did was sophisticated but a typical high-end practice might have included heavy doses of such things as personal injury, maritime practice, construction, and the like in addition to sophisticated commercial and contract work.<p>As litigation exploded in the 1960s and 1970s, as law came to fill social needs previously not considered within its province (e.g., non-discrimination laws), and as mechanisms were adopted to promote large-scale legal actions (e.g., class actions), law morphed from having been primarily a &quot;profession&quot; to being primarily a business. The McCutchen (now Bingham) firm that I worked for in the early 80s had about 250 lawyers then and was considered elite. In 1965, it has 20 lawyers, a level to which it had grown from its formation in the 1880s. Today, it has well over 1,000 lawyers and is part of a conglomerate firm with branches in many cities throughout the world. Along with this growth came the rise of hourly billing practices that were typically &quot;aggressive.&quot; Demand was such that large companies sopped up the services and paid dearly for the privilege: high rates, team-based billing practices with multiple attorneys and paralegals typically staffing a matter while each billing every minute of all their interactions with one another in meetings, chats, intra-office communications, etc.<p>In the beginning, as this explosion in growth occurred, clients were reticent to question the resultant high billings. By the mid-1980s, however, the remnants of the old-style &quot;profession&quot; were rapidly fading and law was a big business. Firms such as Finley Kumble were suddenly formed out of nothing by defecting big-firm partners who saw large and fast profits as the primary goal of their business and the billing practices quickly became abusive (Finley became a poster child for this sort of thing and fell apart owing to client revulsion at such abuses).<p>Thereafter, large companies began to question billings much more closely. The rise of in-house lawyers was in part a reaction to the high cost of outside services but, in time, those lawyers were also used routinely to &quot;manage&quot; the outside firms by keeping their billings in line, among other things. After a while, as the go-go years of the 1980s and 1990s culminated eventually in the tech bubble of 2000, a funny pattern emerged by which a big-firm billing was almost in the nature of an &quot;opening offer.&quot; It would routinely come in very high, the in-house people would demand it be reduced, and, after some back-and-forth, &quot;adjustments&quot; would be made and it would be paid.<p>The pattern lasted until the bust of 2008 and 2009, which bust sent the big firms reeling and has caused a further re-evaluation of billing practices. The reason for the further change was simply one of supply and demand. Pre-bust, no matter what the abuses, the law firms held ultimate sway because even the largest companies with the most sophisticated in-house staffs would be wary of switching firms easily or of wanting to alienate their main outside firms in any way. That changed with the bust. Suddenly, the large firms looked bloated, overstaffed, and inefficient. And clients, who came to hold the leverage, used it to demand billing concessions: lower rates, caps, fixed-fee arrangements, discounts, and the like. And the law firms had to adjust.<p>In the meantime, quite apart from the big firms, technology has changed law firm billing practices generally. Owing to the widespread availability of information today, clients are much more savvy about how legal billing works and are not hesitant to ask for arrangements that make sense for the client even while being fair to the lawyers providing the services. Thus, scrutiny of legal billing is taken as a given and we have indeed come around 180 degrees from where it all used to be.<p>What SimpleLegal is doing is thus very timely and interesting. Honest and fair billing should be the goal of both lawyers and clients and this seems like an excellent model for helping to promote this. I wish them well in their endeavors.",1375809699

6167826,comment,6166113,6166384,1,0,SeanLuke,,,"> primarily by increasing trail and rake<p>This is oddly redundant, kind of like saying &quot;primarily by using computers and laptops&quot;.<p>Trail is the tendency of the front wheel of a bicycle or motorcycle to act like a caster.  If you change the bike geometry so as to increase trail, the bike will increase its resistance to being turned (steered).  This makes the bike easier to handle, particularly at high speeds, and makes it much easier to ride no-hands.  But it&#x27;s not all good: it also makes it very hard to control the bike when the wheel has a lot of load on it (like front panniers) and makes the bike less manipulable.<p>You can change the trail by changing the angle of the steering column (steeper angle, lower trail), changing the size of the wheels (smaller wheels, lower trail), or adding &quot;rake&quot;, which is the forward swoop that many bikes have in their front fork (more rake, lower trail).  Though some think rake is to provide a bit of bounce or suspension, it&#x27;s really not.  It&#x27;s a device used to add trail.",1375809505

You can build a bike with a negative or zero rake angle that is still self-stable (at least, according to the bicycle dynamics modelling software they were using, JBike6; they didn&#x27;t actually build this particular bike, but did build one that had small negative trail and no gyroscopic effects that was still stable).<p>As they demonstrate in the paper, none of rake angle, trail, or gyroscopic forces are either necessary or sufficient for self-stability. All of them can influence stability, so saying the gyroscopic theory has been proven wrong is not entirely right either; it is a part of the dynamics that adds stability, it is simply not necessary or sufficient on its own. In fact, the paper shows that on the &quot;benchmark bicycle&quot;, removing the gyroscopic force makes it unstable, so on that particular design, the gyroscopic force is necessary for its stability (thus explaining why it was believed for so long that gyroscopic force is what provided stability).<p>What we know is that gyroscopic forces, trail, rake angle, and distribution of the center of mass of the fork and body of the bicycle all influence stability (in particular, the center of mass of the body of the bike being substantially higher than that of the fork); none of them alone are sufficient to provide stability, and likewise none of them alone are necessary as we can build bikes without them that are still self-stable.",1375809258

Well, no company ever is, really. It&#x27;s like when every company under the sun says they &quot;only hire A people&quot;. They don&#x27;t. They say they do and they want to, but they don&#x27;t. Otherwise no B or C people would ever make their way through these companies and we all know they do. Heck, there are C, D and F people leading venture funded companies in SF right now.<p>So, in closing to this rambling comment, terms don&#x27;t matter. Systems of management aren&#x27;t important. Focus on the people, the mission and understanding both and you&#x27;ll be fine.",1375809040

It&#x27;s still relatively easy to throw hardware at the load problem (up to a point, naturally), but safety shouldn&#x27;t take a back seat to performance.<p>The wget shell script installation does make me nervous and I&#x27;m glad the source is available separately. Blind installation of scripts was never &quot;a thing&quot; with me.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m still glad people are writing proper web servers (as opposed to simple 2-10 line ones).

If someone has access to your computer and wants to do damage, they have full access to do it.<p>However, keep in mind &#x27;open door&#x27; syndrome. A crime of opportunity is very different than one of bad intentions. Leave a car unlocked with a $20 bill on the seat and you might find that $20 gone when you return. Now, if you lock the doors the odds are it will still be there when you return. The fact is that when you increase the barrier to doing evil, many give it up. A potentially honest person might open a door and take something but if they must now break a window to accomplish the same task many will not pursue it.<p>Having to potentially download a third party program to decrypt the password DB and/or run additional commands is very different that just navigating to the chrome settings page. Its almost akin to why so many coworkers always jacked each others wallpaper when they forgot to lock their computer. They could have still done it even though the computer was locked, but they did not because it was too much work.<p>Also, going off what you have said, the &quot;locking&quot; process in windows is pointless since it offers a false sense of security. It can be broken just by rebooting the computer with a boot disk, right? So why include it? Because its useful.",1375808421

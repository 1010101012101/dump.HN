I prefer to define genius as one who fundamentally changes the way we think about the field in which is genius operates.<p>By this definition, a genius can have an incredible talent for a field without having deconstructed the way their talent comes into being.  They work on intuition.  It is up to the people the follow them to figure out how they did it.",1190745889

59493,comment,59491,59491,0,0,karzeem,,,"This article isn't notable for its content as much as for the evidence its presents about where social networks are in the media.  I was a freshman in college when Facebook and MySpace came out, and to anyone my age, articles like this would have been passe two years ago.  It's a little funny watching the rest of the world go through exactly the same little crazes (how many friends can I add today?  what do I do if someone I don't like friends me?) that we went through back in 2004.<p>It's reminiscent of those articles from the late 90s explaining the various types of emoticons.",1190745251

7134273,comment,7132783,7132783,1,0,Broken_Hippo,,,"I am very far from alarmed. Though I can think of all of the &#x27;scary&#x27; doom scenarios that go along with this, I figured out a long time ago that even my normal barely-running vehicles could be broken into or worse. Any doom beyond that has chances that are more rare than hurting myself while getting into the same car. So I&#x27;m not going to worry about it.<p>I&#x27;ll continue to take reasonable precautions (don&#x27;t keep valuables in the vehicle, have insurance, look into the car at night since I rarely lock it, etc). And yes, I rarely lock the car. I figure that a broken window (what I figure is the most common entry) will hurt me more financially and cause more inconvenience than anything in the car.<p>Technically speaking, if people can get my credit card numbers, it is unsurprising that the door lock technology can be manipulated. Locks never keep the determined out, it merely forces them to work more creatively.",1390867149

My recent favorite is discovering &#x27;ppriv&#x27;, which lets you drop processes&#x27; privileges on a process-by-process basis without even starting up a new container/zone to encapsulate them. E.g. you can run a process with no network access or with no ability to fork, or with no ability to read/write files (or all of the above). Super-handy for running untrusted code as a stdin->stdout filter without worrying about it causing other mischief, and not having to encapsulate it in a zone/jail/container just to run one process.<p>FreeBSD&#x27;s &#x27;capsicum&#x27; [1] also looks promising at the OS API level as a similar initiative to write code with minimal privileges, but afaict you can&#x27;t use it on the command line to run unmodified code with restricted privileges, at least not yet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/</a>",1390867082

7134246,comment,7124753,7133823,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"I think I would mostly agree with your definition of fundamentalism - I just would be careful with that &quot;binary views&quot; thing, as that indeed often is a characteristic of fundamentalists, but it&#x27;s not a defining characteristic. I also have very binary views about slavery - but I think I could give you well-founded rational arguments for my position. This is often not appreciated, but there are plenty of questions where there is no gray area whatsoever, so a view that does not allow for any compromise whatsoever can actually be perfectly rational (the only &quot;gray area&quot; of sorts is that any rational argument can be attacked at its premises, but there just are some premises that are sufficiently well-founded empirically that noone really expects them to ever be invalidated). Also, not everyone who thinks that we would live in a utopia of sorts if we followed their lead is necessarily wrong, as you also can see from history: A world (kinda) without slavery really seems to be a far better world, even if it might have seemed totally utopic back when slavery was normal and people who advocated for abolishing slavery might not have been particularly popular.<p>Now, I never said fundamentalism (by that definition) was good. I only applied exactly what you are saying to what you were saying: People who fight against fundamentalism for the wrong reason are doing the wrong thing. There are good reasons for fighting against fundamentalism, &quot;fundamentalism is bad because it&#x27;s bad&quot; is not one of them, as that is just dogma, aka blind faith, aka fundamentalism. But I guess you did already understand that - though it&#x27;s not at all similar to the case of &quot;intolerance of intolerance&quot;, except at a very superficial level. There is a contradiction between &quot;advocating for a world without intolerance&quot; and &quot;defending the intolerance of people&quot;, which is why that conflict has to be resolved somehow, and it&#x27;s easy to resolve it in such a way that &quot;intolerance of intolerance&quot; really is a perfectly self-consistent concept that provides real value to humanity (when your goal is to improve people&#x27;s well-being, there is no contradiction in allowing gay people to be openly gay (tolerance) and also putting people who try to kill gay people in prison (&quot;intolerance&quot;)), which is why that &quot;criticism&quot; really doesn&#x27;t make any sense - it&#x27;s essentially just being obsessed with a word which has a somewhat ambiguous meaning. It is perfectly possible, though, to provide rational arguments for why fundamentalism is bad, ultimately grounding it in almost universal preferences like avoidance of pain, suffering, sickness, ... - I did provide one rough version of such an argument in my last post. That&#x27;s why &quot;fundamentalism is bad because it&#x27;s bad&quot; is bad.<p>Now, it&#x27;s obvious that those same rules do apply to the FSF and RMS, but I doubt there are many devout RMS worshippers. And if you were trying to imply that RMS was a fundamentalist - well, I guess I would suggest that you try to understand his position and his arguments, because, you know, he does actually have arguments, and those are not quotes from a holy book, but actually rational statements based on explicitly stated premises. When doing that, you might even see that he understands the gray areas around his position very well, it&#x27;s just not his primary job to promote the gray areas - but if you don&#x27;t call Bill Gates a fundamentalist because he doesn&#x27;t promote Debian, possibly calling RMS a fundamentalist because he doesn&#x27;t promote proprietary software isn&#x27;t quite appropriate either? One certainly can disagree with him on things, but claiming that his world view was purely based on dogma says more about you than about him. Now, maybe I am putting in your mouth what stephenr said, in that case take it less personally ;-)",1390866722

And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

7134209,comment,7132754,7134086,8,0,pron,,,"> The &quot;.Net&quot; can be much faster than Java because Java has to have the things on the heap which can be on the stack.<p>This is a famous fallacy (except in some very specific circumstances). The reason for the performance difference is probably due to packed structures and better CPU cache behavior.<p>Stack/heap makes very little difference in most circumstances for two reasons: first, Java heap allocation is as fast as stack allocation – it is a thread-local pointer bump. Deallocation for short-lived objects is free. You do incur an indirect cost of triggering a young-generation GC which causes a pause linearly related to the size of new-but-not-so-young objects. These pauses add up to very little (under 1% of total time). The second reason is that stack memory is usually a very small percentage of the total memory for interesting programs. Programs manipulate data. Non trivial programs usually manipulate lots of it, otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t need so many gigabytes of RAM. A thread&#x27;s stack is rarely over a few megabytes in size, so to have a significant portion of your data on stack you need tens of thousands of threads which the OS can&#x27;t handle anyway.<p>To sum up: 1) Java&#x27;s handling of short-lived memory is extremely fast; 2) all interesting data lives on the heap anyway.<p>Stack allocation can make a difference in reducing the number of young gen GCs, but it&#x27;s not a huge difference in most circumstances. Packing your heap data structures better is more important.",1390866245

Direct injected four strokes have nearly instantaneous throttle response, whereas because the air-fuel mixture in a two stroke has to flow through the reed valves, the crank case, and then up to the combustion chamber, they have a delay.<p>This is made worse by the un-clean burn inherent in the gas/oil mixture a two stroke burns.<p>A 125 might rev slightly faster from 6000-12000 than a 250 four stroke, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t right from idle. And also note that the four stroke I&#x27;m comparing it to is TWICE the displacement. A high performance 125cc four stroke (like European cafe racers use) would certainly rev quicker.<p>Still.. I ride a two stroke all the time like I said. I grew up on them, so the sound, the vibration, and the powerband just feels like home. I&#x27;m sure you feel similarly which would explain why you restore old bikes (I love the Elsinores too, even though they are before my time).

Though at this point, what kind of half-ased terrorist wouldn’t just assume the NSA has everything?<p>I think the biggest shell game might arise from the distinction between account (say, my entire Google identity) and selector (my various GMail email addresses, Blogger ID, etc). By permitting reporting on selectors, not users, this could obscure whether a report affects 30 identities of one customer or the accounts of 30 customers. Further, there’s a lot we still don’t know about what FISC might consider a selector (they have, in the past, considered entire telecom switches to be).",1390865964

Bar gets a copy of W and modifies it (call the modified version Y) such that Y now does support remote network interaction when it is run on a server.<p>We assume that Foo, the original copyright holder of W, did not have to &quot;comply&quot; with AGPLv3 section 13 not ony because there was no AGPLv3 licensor upstream from Foo but also because W wouldn&#x27;t have triggered section 13 under any reasonable reading, since W was not &#x27;remote-network-interactive&#x27; software.<p>Clearly if Bar publicly deploys Y, Bar must comply with AGPLv3 section 13. The question is whether Bar has to do something like ensure Y presents a download-source link if Bar merely publishes Y for others to download and install themselves.<p>Bradley&#x27;s view is that Bar does have such an obligation, for two reasons. One, this is how Bradley reads the text of AGPLv3 section 13 paragraph 1. (I admit that this is one plausible reading of it.) Two, if this weren&#x27;t the proper interpretation, then there would be a loophole of sorts, or at least a policy frustration, in AGPLv3: If Bar gives Y to Baz, and merely complies with the GPLv3 subset of AGPLv3, then Baz will have the Corresponding Source, but Baz will have no obligation to make that source code available to Baz&#x27;s users of Baz&#x27;s deployment of Y. Those users will thus never get the improvements Bar made to W unless they also get a compliantly-distributed copy of Y from Bar.<p>Bradley was closely involved in the drafting of the original (2002) AGPL and I think his interpretation is influenced by that.<p>RMS sided with Bradley: he felt that in this scenario Bar had to do something to Y to make sure that when Y was run it would comply with the source code availability requirement of AGPLv3 section 13.<p>I don&#x27;t believe this interpretation has been recorded in the FSF&#x27;s GNU Licenses FAQ yet. I don&#x27;t have any link or reference other than what I&#x27;m reporting right now  (this came out of an email discussion).<p>Note that I do not think RMS would take the view reported above if <i>W</i> had been remote-network-interactive software, though I have not asked this question of RMS. W failing to &quot;self-comply&quot; with AGPLv3 section 13 in that case ought to mean that no downstream distributee ought to be held to have to comply with it (somewhat like (A)GPLv3 5d/GPLv2 2c, which was part of the inspiration for the original AGPL).",1390865336

7134087,comment,7126605,7130363,1,0,dalke,,,"My assertion is that reducing government to &quot;people-with-guns&quot; is not useful, because there are non-force means of state coercion.<p>You say that without the ability to project force, then a response from someone being denied services is force, and when that happens, the government responds with force.<p>So be it. Yes, that&#x27;s almost completely true. At some point, every single action can be trumped by someone with bigger guns, and everything recast into a force viewpoint.<p>There&#x27;s a few which cannot and were not trumped by guns. Under the old laws, someone had to plead innocent or guilty before being tried, and lands could not be confiscated without trial. Giles Corey famously resisted the torture of being pressed to death, calling out &quot;more weight!&quot; instead of pleading innocent or guilt. As there was no trial, his lands were not forfeit to the government. Having the biggest guns didn&#x27;t work there.<p>As a more hypothetical example, it&#x27;s hard for you alone to force a doctor to do a quadruple bypass on you, because at some point you will be unconscious, and the doctor can simply stop working. You might try various dead man options, but the odds of success for you are very small. Nor can you and a thousand others, by threat of force, get people to build you a spacecraft to travel to the Moon and back - there are too many points of failure where a single person, through deliberate negligence, can stop that from happening.<p>In any case, a government does not need to claim a monopoly on violence, nor does civilization need that as a prerequisite. I pointed to the Viking sagas as a case in point. Look specifically at Grettir&#x27;s Saga. It&#x27;s acceptable to kill someone, so long as you are willing to pay the weregild. That&#x27;s part of medieval Scandinavian law, which is not based on a central authority.<p>In this saga, the people involved could not settle on the payment themselves, so they consulted the lawman. (The lawman was the sole government office of the medieval Iceland.) Thorkel Moon decided on how the weregild was to be paid from the lands. In addition, the killing started because of a disagreement in who gained from a beached whale. The lawman decided &quot;henceforth be it made law, that each man have the drifts before his own lands.&quot; Based on the previous paragraphs of the saga, which describe the violence between the different parties, I easily draw the conclusion that  people decided it was better to follow that edict than to undergo the deadly fighting every time this might happen in the future.<p>Clearly civilization can exist and has existed where the government does not claim a monopoly on violence.<p>Even in US law, the government has explicitly stated that certain types of violence by non-state actors are explicitly allowed, and the government will not interfere. For example, parents are allowed to beat their children, to some extent, even when a government actor cannot do so.<p>Yes, you can recast this as the government allowing some sort of devolved violence, but as it&#x27;s indistinguishable from saying that the government has a non-monopoly on violence, and there&#x27;s clear examples where government didn&#x27;t have a monopoly on violence, I conclude that your view is too reductionist to be useful.<p>&quot;Laws either are backed by violence if you persist in violating them, or are ultimately irrelevant&quot;<p><i>shrug</i> Everything is ultimately irrelevant. The US will crumble and/or be replaced someday. All acts of violence any of us do will eventually be meaningless in the face of entropy.<p>In the shorter term, consider the US Pledge of Allegiance, probably the most recited socialist-derived words in the US. US law - the Flag Code - describes the pledge. The Supreme Court in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette said that the government could not force child to state the pledge, as it was a violation of the First Amendment. Further court decisions said that a child could not be punished for not standing up for the pledge, and that recitation must be voluntary.<p>Thus we have a law which has no &quot;guns&quot; behind it. When teachers have tried to punish students for not saying the pledge, the government courts have reprimanded and fined the schools.<p>And yet that law has a coercive ability even though there is no state force. It&#x27;s backed by social ostracism, yes, but that&#x27;s certainly not part of &quot;the government&#x27;s monopoly on violence.&quot;",1390864702

Either way, it&#x27;s a fair question.<p>As a point of semantics:  TDD generally stands for &quot;test-driven development,&quot; not &quot;test-driven design,&quot; though the article here does make the claim that TDD helps with design.<p>To reduce my personal philosophy to a near tautology: if you don&#x27;t design the system to be testable, it&#x27;s not going to be testable.  TDD, to me, is really about designing for testability.  Doing that, however, isn&#x27;t easy: knowing what&#x27;s testable and what&#x27;s not requires a lot of practical experience which tends to be gained by writing a bunch of tests for things.  In addition, the longer you wait to validate how testable your design actually is, the more likely it is that you got things wrong and will find it very painful to fix them.  So when I talk about TDD myself, I&#x27;m really talking about &quot;design for testability and validate testability early and often.&quot;  If you don&#x27;t have a clue how you want to build things, TDD isn&#x27;t going to help.<p>If you take TDD to mean strictly test-first development . . . well, I only find that useful when I&#x27;m fixing bugs, where step 1 is always to write a regression test (if possible).  Otherwise it just makes me miserable.<p>The other thing worth pointing out is that design for testability isn&#x27;t always 100% aligned with other design concerns like performance, readability, or flexibility:  you often have to make a tradeoff, and testability isn&#x27;t always the right answer.  I personally get really irked by the arguments some people make that &quot;TDD always leads to good design; if you did TDD and the result isn&#x27;t good, you&#x27;re doing TDD wrong.&quot;  Sure, plenty of people have no clue what they&#x27;re doing and make a mess of things in the name of testability.  (To be clear, I don&#x27;t think the author here makes the mistake of begging the question:  I liked the article because I think it honestly points out many of the types of mistakes people make and provides a reasonable approach to avoiding them.)",1390863962

It&#x27;s a pointer to that &#x27;14&#x27; stored 13 bytes past the start of the string (&quot;hello, world\\n&quot; is 13 bytes). The ecx points to (0x..A4), exactly 13 less than B1.<p>edit: You&#x27;re probably thinking it should be placed as an immediate value.

The fact is that the argument &quot;criminals can use it, therefore it must be tightly controlled&quot; is applicable to anything. Yes, it is not <i>currently applied</i> to anything, because of political constellations and expediency and current needs of various power groups. But if you support this argument, you are supporting it wholesale, or abandoning logic and resorting to &quot;I like this, but I hate that, logic be damned&quot;. You&#x27;ll be in a big company with the latter, but it is nothing to be proud of. Same argument you are using for money can be applied to information, people, etc. What you are saying basically that everything should be controlled by the government as soon as the government feels it wants it. This is a consistent viewpoint, but you should not be refusing to admit it.<p>2. I never said money laundering laws and bitcoin are incompatible. What I said is the properties of bitcoin which make it attractive now as money (as opposed to speculative commodity, for example) - i.e. independence from government, anonymity, etc. - are incompatible with those laws and with the motivations that lie behind those laws. Just as we discovered that secure communications are incompatible with government&#x27;s need for surveillance, and the secure communications lost.",1390863910

The Constitution doesn&#x27;t lay out the specific form of a &quot;declaration of war&quot;; the Korean War, for instance, was fought under the aegis of a UN declaration. Wars fought under informal authorization by Congress date all the way back to Jefferson and the First Barbary War.<p>It&#x27;s a popular myth that we&#x27;re fighting an &quot;undeclared&quot; war against al Qaeda, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s all it is. We really did declare war against al Qaeda, by name, in 2001, and because al Qaeda is a brand name and not a nation state, at war we will remain until Congress repeals the AUMF.<p>The comparison to WW2 is simple: during WW2, scores of German-Americans traveled to Europe to fight on behalf of the Nazis. We didn&#x27;t read them their rights before we killed them. American citizenship did not shield them from the consequences of armed conflict. If al-Awlaki wanted to prosecute his cause using the mechanisms of due process, it was a decidedly stupid idea for him to take up residence in territory controlled by AQAP, where the only reasonable mechanism the US had available to it to stop him from killing innocent civilians was an airstrike.<p>Also, you&#x27;re wrong about the President&#x27;s authorization to kill whomever he labels a &quot;terrorist&quot;. The President does not have a blanket authorization to use the military against &quot;terrorists&quot;. He has authorization only to strike against al Qaeda and those persons and organizations who assisted in the attacks on 9/11.

The number of me-too companies out there keeps growing.  I think that the entrepreneurs starting these companies would be well advised to realize that the VC community is actually COUNTING on most of these to fail.  So this represents a large number of our brightest young men expending their best efforts on enterprises that everyone accepts will probably ultimately fail.  This is concerning for the economists.<p>I was reading on a blog of very good repute this morning about two financing deals that were announced today.  One, was for Multiverse.  They were given $4.175 million for a post money valuation of right around $10 million.  This is familiar to most of us.  The second was for HiPiHi.  They were given somewhere between $7 Million and $10 Million for a post money valuation of between $70 and $100 Million.  Both companies are in the same segment, virtual worlds.  Both companies are at the same stage of life.  ""Why the different valuations?"", demanded this blog.<p>HiPiHi is Chinese.  Frankly, Chinese entrepreneurs have a better track record with respect to actually having users PAY for their products.  EVEN THOUGH THE CHINESE USERS ARE NOTORIOUS PIRATES.  Although most of the money was coming from American VCs, the advantage was given to the Chinese team because of this crucial difference.  So China's young men are gaining experience building companies, our young men are gaining experience flipping companies.<p>Is there still any hope?<p>Can ANY of you young men see where I'm going with this?<p>It's anyone's guess how the current tech industry story ends.  However, from the standpoint of a dispassionate economic analysis it would be thoroughly understandable if it ended poorly.",1180734093

By letting your unconscious make the decision, you can tap into all the knowledge that just doesn't fit in your conscious mind.  The brain's basically a massive pattern-recognizer: gut calls are effectively patterns bubbling up into your subconscious that rely on some deeply hidden information.  <p>Gut calls fail terribly when made by people with no expertise in the subject.  Blink gave the example of Warren G. Harding: he fit everybody's preconceived notions of what a strong leader should look like, but he was an idiot.  George W. Bush is a more modern example.  Every time you suffer buyer's remorse after an impulse purchase, it's your gut letting you down.  <p>Every entrepreneur needs to realize that <i>hiring is inherently a low-information process</i>.  You don't know <i>anything</i> about the person applying for the job.  You can convince yourself by gut call that he's a good fit, but you're as likely to be wrong as right.<p>The real best way to hire is to have the person work for you for about 3-6 months as a contractor or intern first.  <i>Then</i> you go based on your intuition.  After 3 months, you've got a stock of information to make a good gut call.  You've worked with them daily.  But you can't just expect your intuition to magically work in your favor, no matter what.",1180733326

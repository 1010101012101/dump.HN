I actually don&#x27;t think JavaScript (particularly on the server) is a very good language at all. Blasphemy, I know.<p>As someone who has spent time with JS frameworks like Ember, Meteor, and the rest, as well as libraries and component systems like Rendr, React, and Backbone, it&#x27;s certainly not the case that JavaScript is free of frustration. In fact, I&#x27;ve found the opposite to be true: despite the enthusiasm, some of these solved a bunch of problems only to create others.<p>The truth is, if you focus on being a great <i>engineer</i> then picking up another language and framework isn&#x27;t very difficult. It will make you a better programmer to see how other systems solve problems.<p>Not to speak out of both sides of my mouth, but I do advocate being a master at one or two languages and learning how to write idiomatic code. I just think there&#x27;s room for more than literally one.<p>If someone tells you that Node is here to save us all from certain disaster and JavaScript is the One True Answer, I would simply nod your head, smile, say thank you, and then run as fast as you can.",1413827920

8483510,comment,8481738,8483069,0,0,Nelson69,,,"Has anyone ever had great things to say about IBM?<p>I did my 7 years there, FWIW... It&#x27;s not a geek friendly company, I think it just happens to be that simple.  They do some great technology, they&#x27;ve invented a ton of great stuff but where geeks embrace the technology for the technology and dream, IBM does technology because they can sell it and, again, it&#x27;s just that simple.  Whereas Microsoft and a lot of the SV companies are based on the idea that a great tech company needs to be run by a great engineer/nerd.  IBM is firmly rooted in the camp that great companies are run by great sales folks and they&#x27;ve had an incredible run.  That&#x27;s why hackers so consistently hate them.   Hackers and geeks just see the technology differently.<p>I really don&#x27;t know what their future holds,  their downfall has been predicted for decades.  Getting out of PCs made a lot of sense to me,  I still think HP and Dell are potentially in heaps of trouble as soon as some Russian, Indian or Chinese company decides to really go after them and starts to figure things out, they&#x27;re just putting commodity parts together at the end of the day anyways.  Getting out of semiconductor manufacturing doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad idea either,  there are some very very good fab shops out there and they&#x27;re only going to get better and the margins on fab-for-hire will drop so you have to corner the volume.  I definitely can say I&#x27;d love to just screw around with a Watson,  maybe even have a Watson app on my iPhone and just ask it stuff throughout the day,  I&#x27;d pay some subscription for it (maybe like $20-30 a month if it&#x27;s as good as it looked)  but I bet what I&#x27;d pay is a drop in the bucket compared to what law firms, certain doctors or various financial executives would pay for one and so long as there is that market, I&#x27;d assume IBM will go after that and not the solo geek that just wants to have a really fancy google and wikipedia search.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re going to build in the future, but I&#x27;m pretty confident they&#x27;ll make piles of money and be disdained and have their demise predicted by geeks though.",1413827838

If you are just starting out and would like to work in general web development, committing yourself to JS only would be stupid beyond belief. That would assume that JS based frameworks are going to be ubiquitous in the near future. They definitely won&#x27;t be and there are many reasons to doubt that they will be ubiquitous in the long term as well. The same can be said for any language or framework, language convergence does not seem to be happening. More likely the landscape will remain unstable in the medium to long term. Therefore, as a generalist web developer you will be better served by polyglotism. Learn MVC and other application design patterns. Learn server side programming and client side programming. Learn SQL and others ways of interfacing with persistence layers. In short, don&#x27;t stop learning and don&#x27;t assume that there is one holy grail or one right way to do it.

If you can&#x27;t access any other website after visiting a blocked site, you maybe have a problem with you network configuration (just an assumption).\n2- You cannot connect your VPN in a Starbucks because they block the ports/protocols that allows your VPN to work. Sometimes, it&#x27;s also the reason why it&#x27;s hard to connect to your VPN. It&#x27;s also the reason why sometimes your connection may suddenly stop working (download speed drop to 0). My assumption on that is, if, randomly, they detect too much trafic through encrypted channel, they block it.\n3- No, if you&#x27;re not using a Chinese browser, you&#x27;re probably not infected by any &quot;virus&quot;. Although, some says QQ may include some spyware in it. I don&#x27;t know much on that.\n4- Your provider knows what you&#x27;re looking at. Like any provider in the world. Because internet companies in China are owned by the government at more than 50%, then indirectly yes, the government potentially knows what you&#x27;re doing.\nThe truth is quite different. In reality, their system is pretty similar than prism (yes, really). When the &quot;police&quot; require some data, they ask the providers about the metadata. That&#x27;s it. From what I&#x27;ve heard, they&#x27;re much less organised than they seems. The real difference between Chinese gvt and others it that they don&#x27;t hide doing it. Plus the censorship.\n5- &quot;I assume that, somewhere on a government database [...]&quot;, hm, probably not.<p>I&#x27;ve heard GFW had several ways to &quot;censor&quot; the internet: DPI and DNS poisoning mostly. Also some &quot;random control&quot;. Also, the GFW is this kind of system able to learn and adapt itself. Apparently, if too many people try to access a foreign website, it gets blocked. There is also some crawlers looking for keywords ... Not 100% sure, it can be only guesses.<p>About the &quot;QoS downgrade&quot; @auganov was talking about, once again it&#x27;s a bit different. What really happens is that the providers have a limited bandwidth to go outside of China. Biggest providers (China Telecom/Unicom) have &quot;a lot&quot;, others have really not much, but it&#x27;s still pretty limited, and when many people are connecting together, we&#x27;re back in the old days of &quot;rush hours&quot; and slow internet. In the middle of the night, I can easily reach 5MB/s (which is about 40Mbps), through VPN.<p>Hope I answered your questions :) Also, if anyone knows a bit more about GFW, I&#x27;d be glad to hear about it!",1413827676

8483429,comment,8482673,8482673,0,0,ColinDabritz,,,"You bring up a specific challenge, how to handle it when you realize a deadline is probably going to be missed. That&#x27;s one aspect, but you also need to look at why your deadline is going to be missed more broadly.<p>Here are some challenges that come to mind in software estimation:<p>1. Estimates are almost always done too quickly, with too little information. If you can wait, spend more time, or reduce the unknowns, do so. If nothing else give it an extra fifteen minutes. If you can say &quot;I&#x27;ll get back to you with an estimate by ...&quot; (e.g. tomorrow or end of day) that&#x27;s even better.<p>2. Estimates are ranges, a probability that the work will be done across a range of time. but are often given as a specific date or amount (e.g. &quot;It will be done tuesday/take 5 working days&quot;). Early or quick estimates may be ranges of 15x or more (e,g, &quot;it will be eight hours to three full work weeks&quot;). Don&#x27;t be afraid to capture that ambiguity in a range. Others may not understand ranges, so give them the high end if needed, but at least be aware that ranges exist. Often ranges, or high estimates get push back. This is your opportunity to specify what questions need answers, what requirements need refined, and what areas need more design and architecture to reduce ambiguity. These things can reduce ranges of estimates.<p>3. Know the difference between estimates, targets, goals, and commitments. Confusion between these leads to miscommunication and frustration. Often we&#x27;ll make a guess like &quot;maybe two weeks&quot; which is a wild instant estimate, and others will see how nicely that lines up with their target date, and believe you have committed to that goal. Commitments should be explicit, and part of your process.<p>4. Do not negotiate estimates. Managers are trained to negotiate, and a naive manager will almost always reduce estimates through negotiation, which is a distortion of reality. Developers should collect the information they need about the requirements, ask questions, then produce their estimate in isolation, and refuse to change it. The way to change an estimate is to change the requirements, often addressing ambiguity and questions, and re-estimate the work given the new information. This is hard to do, because a &quot;better&quot; timeline can make everyone feel better in the moment, but will lead to problems later.<p>5. Renegotiate when change happens, or when you are in danger of failing a commitment. This one answers half of the original question, to my mind. If you didn&#x27;t make a clear commitment, or requirements are changing with out any renegotiation, you have to fix those first. After that, keep a close eye on scope creep, and changes. Change happens, accept that, but make sure that those you have commitments to understand that change has impact on your commitments, and you can either commit to the original work and timeline, or you can commit to the new work, and a new timeline. Holding you to new work on an original timeline is not fair to you, and not a problem to be solved at the developer level. This one can be quite challenging, some people use &quot;change management&quot;, itemized / ticket based change requests, even explicit signoffs. If you have trouble here, find what works for you.<p>6. Learn from history. You won&#x27;t get it right. A lot. Keep track of how you are doing, improve processes and spend more time refining requirements/acceptance criteria etc. Make sure commitments are negotiated and explicitly agreed to. Keep learning.<p>7. You will make mistakes. If you uncover new questions, requirements, found work, it was in a certain sense an estimating error, but it has a different fix. If you had a reasonable view of the work to a fair level of detail and spent reasonable time on the estimate, and are still missing your commitment, you have made a mistake. That&#x27;s OK, especially early on, or in new areas for you, if a team has shifted etc. The answer is, communicate. Let your manager know immediately, as soon as you realize it, that you feel you are at risk of failing a commitment, and you need to revisit. From there, you can investigate the new work, or re-estimate based on your increased understanding of the problem. Perhaps note some data for your historical tracking. Learn. Next time, make a better estimate. It does feel bad to miss a commitment, or even to not make a deadline that someone else set up. That&#x27;s very human. The way to feel better about it, is to get better at it.<p>The above is based on my decade of experience as a software developer, and a solid foundation from Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art, By Steve McConnell <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices/dp/0735605351"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Devel...</a><p>I highly recommend the book as a learning resource, and having the whole team, managers included, read at least the first portions of it.

If you look at what Schneier thought to write up in Applied Cryptography, they were either hardware bit encryptors or amateur-hour &quot;RNG + XOR&quot; stuff.<p>RC4 was the first cipher I ever successfully worked with (in my defense, I was a teenager). I had a devilishly hard time debugging block crypto code, but once you had a working RC4 library, you could round-trip data through it trivially. I remember seeing RC4 get embedded in a lot of code for that same reason: if you had RC4, you were &quot;done&quot;, but if you had a 3DES core, you&#x27;d still need to be crypto-literate enough to rig up some half-assed block cipher mode; even ECB requires some adaptation to encrypt arbitrary streams, <i>which is what everyone wants to do</i>.<p>There was a pretty significant amount of interest in reversing the RC4 algorithm (hence &quot;arcfour&quot;), and I think this is part of the reason. People wanted something that worked like a stream cipher, and didn&#x27;t have better alternatives (unless they were themselves cryptographers).<p>Someone more acquainted with the literature might correct me, but my sense is: we didn&#x27;t &quot;move away&quot; from stream ciphers, so much as we didn&#x27;t have them at all, and gradually developed some.

It&#x27;s easy to see that the string &quot;the qu()&!`8zwn fox jumps over the la&quot; is a corruption and truncation of &quot;the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy old dog&quot;, especially if you&#x27;re already used to seeing the original string under normal operation.  By comparison, it&#x27;s much harder to tell whether or not an arbitrary byte string is corrupt, and journald does not make use of any forward error-correction measures to assist in this.<p>> Given that journald can be configured with a log size of 0, and to output everything straight to syslog, this is such a non-complaint it&#x27;s absurd.<p>If I&#x27;m using journald in this configuration, then why does journald need to exist at all?  It&#x27;s literally dead weight, and adds another point of failure to my logging facility.<p>> EDIT: Oh yeah, and this is assuming you&#x27;re not compressing your logs. Which you probably are.

It needs to export and import them all one to a file, as normalized pretty printed JSON, so git can track and merge changes line by line, and recreate the entire system including source code and matching data at a later point in time. Not everything in the database needs to be tracked in git, just the important bits of JSON that need to be kept in sync with the code.<p>What I want to avoid is having a huge monolithic database backed up in a different way and on a different schedule as the source code is being tracked, so the important JSON data is mixed up with bulky transient tables in SQL dumps, so it&#x27;s slow and tedious to recreate the source code with the matching data. What I want is for it to be easy to track and merge and revert changes to that important JSON data, and to back up the data in lock step with the source code that depends on it.<p>Somebody must have tried something like this before -- is it a crazy idea, or is there a better approach, or some system that tackles this problem already?

[12] Its future value to any investigation \nof criminal activity is wholly speculative. Therefore, with no exemption applicable to it, the collection of \nLPR data in the passive manner does not comport with the Data Act&#x27;s strictures and prohibitions, and may \nnot lawfully be done. [13]<p>To absorb this back into the whole phone records thing, here&#x27;s the keypoints I gather from that:<p>1. Need to target specific data that is as constrained as possible given prior knowledge. E.g. If you already know someone spoke on the phone about a crime at X date and never spoke of it at any other date, you are only allowed to obtain and use the records of that date.<p>2. Need to be able to show reasonable belief _before collection_ that the collected data will be useful for an investigation and/or for intelligence on criminal activity. Knowing that a criminal uses a phone is not sufficient cause to collect phone records - it must be demonstrable before collection that those particular phone records might contain information useful for identifying criminal activity or for ongoing investigations.<p>3. Data that is mass-collected for purposes of finding a specific information (e.g. searching for a license plate by processing every car that passes through X intersection) may be kept and shared only until the target information is located and the objectives met.<p>4. Every data collection must have a specific purpose and clear boundaries. Collecting records &quot;to find people who issue death threats&quot;? NOT OKAY. Collecting records &quot;to find this particular issuance of a death threat&quot;? OKAY. In other, techier words, there <i>must be a deliverable</i>. If the goal of a data collection is open-ended, or could take decades, then you must have a specific warrant associated to that data collection, and the data must be discarded once the warrant expires and/or the investigation concludes.<p>This is pretty much my reading of it given cursory scanning of an abstract of the GDCDPA, prior knowledge on legal interpretations for &quot;criminal intelligence information&quot; (an extremely important phrase), and the A.G. advisory linked in parent.",1413825924

8483256,comment,8481487,8481487,0,0,unoti,,,"I&#x27;m 46, I programmed a computer for the first time when I was 10, back when Pong was starting to wane and the Atari 2600 was starting to get big.  I&#x27;ve been programming continuously since then for 36 years.  It&#x27;s been challenging me to stay with it that long, and most people I&#x27;ve known have dropped out for these reasons:<p>1.) Developers get comfortable with a given technology, and eventually stop learning.  And the longer this goes on, the more exceedingly difficult it is to leave that comfort zone, because it makes you feel dumb and slow.  When I first got into the industry, there were lots of folks doing things like IBM mainframe assembly and RPG/3 and COBOL.  They&#x27;d tell me that that was where the real money was, and there was no need to learn new skills.  After all, those systems weren&#x27;t going anywhere, and they were bringing in fat checks.  In fact, the more obscure the technology, the more money they make.<p>This particular trap of sticking with a technology is an insidious one that I almost fell into myself.  In my early 30&#x27;s, after working at the same place for about 10 years, I started coming to the conclusion that I was the best developer that I knew.  I could do stuff in a weekend that other teams of people would fumble over for months.  I was unstoppable.  Then I changed jobs a couple times, and started doing game development, and started getting worried that I was actually not nearly as smart as I thought, and that I was losing my edge.  But the real truth is simply that when you do the same kinds of jobs with the same technologies for many years, you get real good at doing those things.  You find a comfort zone.  And leaving that comfort zone feels wrong, stupid, and even counter-productive.<p>2.) It becomes tempting to switch to management.  Over my career I&#x27;ve worked for innumerable managers who used to be developers in whatever technology was used 5 or 10 years ago, but now they do management.  Often, they don&#x27;t even realize how out of date their grasp on technology is.  It&#x27;s easy to fall into the trap of moving into management, because it&#x27;s typically the only path to any kind of career development or upward mobility.  I&#x27;ve gone into management myself for a few years, but then realized that if I want to be a good developer as my top priority, then I need to spend my time focusing on being the best at that, which can mean making some sacrifices.  Once you move into management, you&#x27;re done unless you keep your skills current.<p>3.) Developers need to continuously retrain themselves.  This one kills most developers dead.  You have to train <i>yourself</i>.  The means not expecting your employer to do it for you or pay you to do it.  Every 5-7 years over the last few decades I&#x27;ve totally changed my technology platform many times, and every time it was because I had spent the last year or so getting ready.  I&#x27;m talking about spending a significant amount of time working with and understanding technologies other than the one you&#x27;re using right now, say about 200 hours per year at least.  I haven&#x27;t read the responses on this forum yet, but I guarantee you will see a pattern of developers feeling like they don&#x27;t need to work hard to retrain themselves.  Saying things like, &quot;programming is my job, it doesn&#x27;t have to be my hobby as well.&quot;  This is a fine attitude, as long as you aren&#x27;t planning to be a developer for more than 5-10 years.<p>If you&#x27;re in software development for the long haul, more than 5-10 years, then you have to be continuously training.  If you&#x27;re not absolutely serious about staying on top of new technology, then your skills will be obsolete and niche within 5-10 years.",1413825421

The primary difference being the level of technical sophistication of the person you are telling.<p>The basics should be the same with either party, though.<p>Always open the communication lines as soon as you know you are behind. You don&#x27;t have to say &quot;My project is definitely going to be late&quot; but rather be honest. If you are behind on a milestone, speak up now.<p>Don&#x27;t assume you can just make up the time during the rest of the project. The worst thing you can do when your project is running behind is make it a surprise to everyone on the day of the deadline.<p>When you speak up early, this is also good for everyone else involved in the project. If you are a freelancer, you can work with your client to make adjustments to the scope to keep things on track or they can delay other parts of the project if it is a coordinated effort of more than just your work.<p>If you are an employee, your manager or team can assess the situation and make plans to make the project successful. This can include changing scope, getting you help from more senior developers, reassigning parts of the project, etc.<p>There&#x27;s no shame in this: the ultimate goal is to be part of successful projects not looking like a hero. Plus you look a lot better if you give everyone a chance to come up with a plan rather than just springing it on them at the last minute that you aren&#x27;t done with your part.<p>It is also a lot less stressful when your team is working together to work toward  a solution. A lot of the stress from this situation is worry about letting the team down or trying to work too much to make up time.<p>Be prepared for people to ask why you are behind though. Give honest answers. I hope your answer isn&#x27;t &quot;I underestimated the project so I thought I had a lot more time to surf HN&quot;, though.<p>This means you need to be completely honest with everyone on your team and speak up early so plans can be made. Again, if you wait until the last minute to say something, after you tried working long hours to make up time (and failed), there isn&#x27;t much that can be done. The project is already late at that point.<p>This is when you get some real anger directed at you, because you screwed over the team by pretending there wasn&#x27;t a problem. You also took away the team&#x27;s ability to make adjustments to compensate and you know.. work as a team.<p>So really, how you bring up the fact that you underestimated part (or all) of your project isn&#x27;t really as important as doing it right away. Be honest with everyone about where you stand.<p>You demonstrate willingness to do this by actually doing it.",1413825057

Gentoo was my primary for a number of years prior, so I&#x27;ve never felt Arch was overly flaky--leastwise not in comparison with the extraordinary breakage in Gentoo that can occur if you&#x27;re not careful (but hey, it happens). So, I think it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that the &quot;feeling&quot; of instability and flakiness is probably taken relative to some benchmark or experience that is difficult to divine from a few short sentences. In my experience, Arch has been quite stable and usable. It&#x27;s not without its warts, of course, but I think it&#x27;s one of the drawbacks you have to live with if you&#x27;re using a rolling release distribution. (I don&#x27;t know how Aptosid seems relative to this since I only use it on a laptop infrequently, but I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s not impervious to odd breakage either.)<p>> Miscellaneous bugs which force me to boot from a USB and chroot to reinstall packages and/or reboot.<p>This one&#x27;s a bit of a nuisance, but I seem to have only had it occur when mkinitcpio runs during an upgrade. I don&#x27;t know if this was due to a bug in earlier versions, but I&#x27;ve since made it a habit to run mkinitcpio immediately after upgrading. I think that&#x27;s culled about 98% of the mysterious breakages for me, usually related to the kernel upgrade process (or modules missing from initrd). Otherwise, it&#x27;s been fire and forget.<p>Forgetting to merge new/updated configs is also a slight nuisance and can lead to breakage. This is partly why I like `yaourt -C`, but it doesn&#x27;t always catch everything.<p>> The systemd migration was not very clean. I&#x27;m glad Arch switched to systemd, but the migration was tricky, and it also came within a few months of another rather tricky update (/bin) that broke things for a lot of people.<p>I had this experience, too, but in my recollection, it was mostly due to the fact that Arch was 1) an early adopter of systemd and 2) the full migration took effect during a time when there were unit files only for the most common services. Fortunately, nearly everything else I needed had been added to the AUR. One of the things I like most about systemd is the relatively low bar of entry to create new unit files for services that didn&#x27;t exist. But, I will concede that some of the early helper unit files were a bit buggy, and the near-constant changes caused an unfortunate bit of havoc. I think that was largely fixed when netcfg was dumped for netctl. netcfg was a pain in the rear.<p>Which reminds me: If there&#x27;s one thing I really missed coming from Gentoo to Arch, it was Gentoo&#x27;s idea of configuring network devices. Until netctl, the only way to include some of the more unusual configurations in Arch required some magic (and lots of tweaking) with the netcfg scripts in order to get the right arguments passed to `ip` without netcfg going insane. Sigh. netctl is much more forgiving and better behaved.<p>> I&#x27;m running Wheezy on another machine, and shellshock still hasn&#x27;t been fixed there, whereas Arch had it patched within hours.<p>Yeah, that was nice. Although I will point out that while the initial shellshock vulnerability was fixed almost immediately, the remaining vulnerabilities in bash <i>weren&#x27;t</i> patched for a couple of days (still better than most everyone else). The final patch was rolled out about a week later when some of the &quot;unofficial&quot; patches were coming out from Redhat that actually <i>did</i> fix bash. Though, I gather from mailing lists linked from here that the disillusionment with upstream maintainers, confusion, and the 3rd party patches/patch sets/collections probably didn&#x27;t help. <i>That</i> was messy.",1413824878

And there is one part that I want to highlight as relevant to me right now:<p>> Far better, then, to use a generalized data library that allows you to manipulate your visual tools with endless freedom. D3 is a great example of such a library. If you&#x27;re writing a data visualization tutorial in JavaScript that uses anything but D3 you have a burden of proof to demonstrate why. This is not because D3 is the end-all-be-all of charting libraries, but rather because any tutorial based on the limited selection of possibilities afforded by anything else is simply not a data visualization tutorial. It&#x27;s a charting options tutorial (also valuable, but far narrower in scope).<p>Yes!  When I saw this article was based on flotr2, I immediately checked to see if it was based on D3.  It was not (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) and I was a bit disappointed because flotr2 appears to be all about charting, but data visualization is <i>much more</i> than just charting.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a good charting package right now, but my requirements are that it&#x27;s based on D3 so that I don&#x27;t have to introduce two different libraries when I need some data visualization that goes beyond mere charting.

I looked at it several years ago and it seemed to be just a mess: scanty documentation, hard to install/set up, lots of bugs. So I&#x27;ve always gone with rolling my own payment code (usually Stripe, sometimes PayPal), and it&#x27;d be nice to stop that, one way or another. It seems like ActiveMerchant will be Payola&#x27;s main competitor.",1413824500

I remember at some point around 2000 reading an article saying that RC4 was suspect <i>because</i> it was a stream cipher, as block ciphers are considered more secure.  Similarly TLS contained only a single stream cipher, and my understanding is that eSTREAM happened because NIST seemed uninterested in stream ciphers.",1413824499

Immediately: <i>Never</i> delay communication. Most people will be less upset about the schedule than the fact that they weren&#x27;t informed.<p>2. With Brutal Honesty: Explain exactly what&#x27;s going on. You may end up with a pleasant surprise. &quot;Oh, can we just have xyz then?&quot; or &quot;How can we reduce the scope?&quot; or &quot; How can we help you make this easier.&quot; An informed customer/boss is a resource to be used.<p>3. Positively: Find a way to deliver <i>something</i> by the deadline. &quot;ABC will be delivered as planned on October 31, but we have run into unexpected issues with Feature xyz, so it may not be fully implemented at that time.&quot; sounds a whole lot better than, &quot;We won&#x27;t hit the October 31 deadline.&quot; You may even give them options in terms of features & dates.

GOG have high acceptance bar usually quality wise, so it makes each release more notable (i.e. they try to avoid the flood of low quality releases which no one can keep track of). So if you pass the bar - you are likely to get some attention, while on Steam your release can be simply lost in the noise.",1413824432

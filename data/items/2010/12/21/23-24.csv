Bad.<p>I'm 100% guilty of this, although I try to stay vigilant.

They accept that many of the YC founders will take life-changing acquisition offers and don't try to stop them. They hope at least some will take a little cash ""off the table"" along the way and then go for The Big Win.<p>3) YC doesn't get paid until a ""liquidity event"".

It seems that the most vocal sexism victims actually experience the least amount of ""real"" sexism (like the girl who complained about being hit on at DEF CON).  Again, these are just my perceptions/opinions, and I could easily be wrong.  However, one thing I am certain of is that we focus too much of our effort on trivial cases of sexism, when we should be battling more important cases like countries that do not allow women equal rights.",1350266298

Also, you mentioned you felt your looks were below average. I would normally never comment on someone's looks since it is inappropriate in a professional environment, but you mention in the article along the lines that you suspect your looks at 55 were not good enough to be discriminated against, but at 55 you were an exceptionally beautiful person, and again far above average. I thought you were closer to 40 than 55. I'll assume your coding skills aren't great like you claim since I have no idea about that as I've not seen your code, but someone with the level of insight into human factors/interaction design comes along quite rarely and your skills and insight there are remarkable and exceptionally valuable. Any company would benefit more from one Kathy Sierra overseeing design than they would from 100 of the best coders.",1350266117

I remember one woman at a place I worked at filed a complaint about sexism because a coworker (kindly) asked her out.  Maybe its not appropriate to ask a coworker out, but it certainly is not sexist (read the definition of sexism if you disagree with me).  A good deal of it actually winds down to the fact that people do not understand the definition of sexism.  Being hit on is not sexism.  Even being sexually harassed does not qualify as sexism -- although it is clearly another type of bad thing.  Sexism is the act of favoring one sex over another.  There are women who do experience sexism, but I would say tech has more ""reverse discrimination"" than anything else.  Objectively, I have seen some very average women programmers get hired into high positions just to fill diversity quotas (and yes, I do know of a few very smart female programmers as well).",1350265437

To the extent it survives, it's been limited mostly to where ""regular"" defamation would also apply, to false statements of fact. For example, ""injurious to another in their trade"" can't be used to prosecute <i>any</i> comment that could harm someone's business, but only false factual statements that could do so, such as accusing someone of selling counterfeit parts. Nowadays the only real distinction is in showing damages: in a <i>per se</i> category, once defamation is proven, the plaintiff doesn't have to further prove that they were harmed, because harm is assumed in those categories.<p>I think mostly we're discussing something else here, angry and vitriolic ""piling-on"" responses, which is a different issue from defaming someone.",1350265125

Reading it really felt like you were part of something special, like a private audience with some of the smartest people in the world.<p>Those magazines were also hard to get, I would travel by bus to a larger library in the city, or download what was available via BBS.

The word 'vicious' bothers me though; it's not ok to use non-arguments and threats or insults to respond to an argument. If someone told me that Abraham Lincoln was the current President of the United States I don't think I'd respond viciously... I'd tell him he was an idiot and show him some evidence on my phone. If he kept it up I think I'd just leave because I'm not responsible for someone else's idiocy. If someone argues with a more complicated position that I hold dear, then I can see how I might respond viciously if I had no actual counter-argument or if I didn't want to spend time to argue with this person. I think you're recognizing how the world works, for complex issues with a bunch of ignorant people you're likely to see very vicious responses because most people cannot articulate the reasoning behind their position or choose not to spend the time to and instead use violence (virtual or otherwise). Perhaps some have real counter-arguments and choose not to present them and instead just respond with arrogance; if so that's sad because no one is informed by better understanding.<p>My initial thought after reading your post was that your view is practical and accurate, that people like Antirez who care more about their primary work (Redis in this case) and not some other issue they have a perspective on (sexism in software) will be drowned out and crushed under the common view and  those who choose to elevate a particular view or cause to their primary purpose. I think (with disdain) about ""pundits"" whose job is to promote some position regardless of its merit; people who spend their lives arguing passionately for whatever pays the most... that is ugly and works against adapting a culture to handle new ideas and situations.<p>EDIT: Spelling only.",1350264408

It is also, do note, a full-page comic. The artwork is fantastic and beautiful, with a particular excellence in linework and architecture. There is somewhat of a homage in Gaiman's Sandman series at various times, notably in The Doll's House.<p>One curious element is the highly racist (to modern sensibilities) depiction of an african child, one of Nemo's companions. For some reason he didn't make the film.<p>Little Nemo ran under two or three different headings and had a hiatus in publishing concurrent with a switch of publications. In my opinion the quality went downhill towards the later years. On the whole, the comic has a compelling and uniquely unreal quality to it; I recommend it highly. As they were originally published about 100 years ago, the copyright should be expired: I believe at any rate that the comic is available on the torrent network of your choice.<p>The film was a decent bit of animation, and the story largely dispenses with the plot of the comic. That is actually to the good; a more literal translation I feel would have been impossible. The only flaw I might single out would be the relative weakness of its musical numbers: if Disney had not made it necessary for any animated film to have songs, it is doubtful that anyone would have thought to add them. On the whole, while it is quite excellent on its own merits, it falls somewhat short of Windsor McKay's mastery of sequential art.<p>The film seems to be available on Hulu:\n<a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/257552"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hulu.com/watch/257552</a>",1350263665

This was the world of Twitter et al.<p>Blogging itself actually has a very interesting property, which is that even if somebody tears you a new one in their own blog post, you don't actually have to know unless you go looking for it. It's a lot easier to blog a controversial opinion than it is to twit it, Facebook it, or post it here or in a forum, because they all have the characteristic that any body with a pulse and a computer anywhere in the world can essentially stick their reply in your face.

It isn't perfect, because you don't get that immediacy that you get in a forum, and it's easy to end up feeling like a lone voice in the wilderness due to lack of feedback, and presumably that's why this medium faded as a means of generating community, killed by the immediacy and quick feedback hits of the more popular community mechanisms. To me it's pretty abundantly clear that all the ""any idiot in your face"" community technologies ultimately start falling apart (requiring either an inhumanly thick skin or flat-out sociopathy), and somehow I'd love to see if there's a way to build something a little more immediate and a little less likely to isolate people entirely, while at the same time retaining the fact that you aren't assaulted by what feels like an entire Internet of knaves and fools every time you open your browser.",1350263427

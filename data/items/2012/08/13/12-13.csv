For instance, following collaborative research discussing about 20 sources, I changed the first sentence to 'Logic, from the Greek  (logik)[1] is defined by the Penguin Encyclopedia to be ""The formal systematic study of the principles of valid inference and correct reasoning"".[2]' in<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logic&oldid=300599816"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logic&oldid=3...</a><p>However, people have their own ideas about what the topic is, and so the lead sentence has become the longer, vaguer, less cogent, unsourced, and, as a recent commenter has pointed out, incoherent two sentences  'Logic (from the Greek  logik)[1] refers to both the study of modes of reasoning (which are valid and which are fallacious)[2] and the use of valid reasoning. In the latter sense, logic is used in most intellectual activities, including philosophy and science, but in the first sense is studied primarily in the disciplines of philosophy, mathematics, semantics, and computer science.'<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logic&oldid=502056441"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logic&oldid=5...</a><p>(note that this [2] supports the old sentence, not the current two sentences)<p>All this in an article that the Wikipedia 1.0 project counts as amongst its 100 most important.<p>I liked editing maths articles - it seemed to attract a nice, well-informed, and result-focussed crowd.

That's why cheap hire of people who ""lack high school diplomas"" makes sense in the US.<p>This does not in anyway suggest that India is now 'outsourcing' back to United States. That is likely to happen only after huge and reverse tilting between the two economies [Assuming China does not exist!].

4375620,comment,4374089,4374089,3,0,VLM,,,"This is a confluence of three cultural impedance mismatches.<p>The first is that some non-Debian distros focus themselves primarily on selecting exactly one, and only and forever one, DE for the distro.  I don't know why this annoying fad spread into an annoying industry standard a couple years ago (OK maybe a decade ago).  So Kubuntu = KDE and Ubuntu = Gnome and never the two shall switch, ever, without a wipe and reformat and reinstall of something else.  Debian is culturally different and you just install what you want.  Its almost like a bad Zen koan.  ""All states have a state religion.  The US has no state religion.  What is the state religion of the US?""  Well its a question that culturally makes no sense.  Sound of one hand clapping.  Mu.  So there is no official DE for Debian, and thats good and how it should be and we all like it like that.  But it makes conversations awkward and weird at a cultural level.<p>The second cultural mismatch is there's a pretty intense focus on being able to distribute A Debian cdrom (emphasis on singular) that will boot and install a minimal system in Debian.  This demand or desire or cultural trait requires that some working subset of Debian be found that will fit in 650 MB.  Other distros just don't care or perhaps they only really support netinst or perhaps their ""minimal single disk install"" is a SL (or DL?) DVD.  Gnome and KDE just are not going to fit along with the required stuff on a single 650 meg cdrom, so bye bye.  I see this gradually shifting in Debian... I haven't done a ""single disk install"" in many years... All PXEboot netinst for many years.  I think my experience is common that sometime in the 00s I switched from optical media to USB/netinst ""media"".  But this cultural trait is how it used to be and it still has momentum.  Someday momentum will build in a new direction, but it hasn't yet, maybe next release?  In the Debian culture you flow with the river or at most try minimal diversion, you don't shout at the waves or lead a cavalry charge into the ocean.<p>The third cultural mismatch is corporate or semi-corporate distros make UI and all other decisions based on marketing, PR, mostly a bunch of tail chasing imagination of what a theoretical user might like, or what we will tell them to like.  Extremely top down organization where the packagers are told exactly what to do.  However the Debian people make Debian ""for their users"" and the most important users with the biggest voice are the Debian devs themselves... Its a intensely bottom up organization.  Out in the real world, no one seriously WANTS to use KDE or Gnome, they just feel in an ""emperor has no clothes"" way that yes they personally don't like either, but that mythical ""everyone else"" just loves gnome and/or kde so they'll go along to get along and select one.  No one in Debian would (intentionally) stand in the way of the work of other maintainers, so if someone wants to package KDE or Gnome, the mythical ""everyman developer"" wouldn't stop them, but if no one wants to use KDE or Gnome, the mythical ""everyman developer"" is not going to force everyone else to use one, just like they wouldn't force a maintainer or user to do things in general.  Another way to look at it, is its very social darwinist, we'll package up some software and if people want it, it grows, if not, it disappears.  Not an intelligent design approach were the C*O and VPs decide which software will live and die.  Its very hard to map top-down cultural thinking about what DE they'll force the users to use, into a bottom-up culture like Debian.  So its weird / uncomfortable / difficult to even discuss the concept of what we'll force the users to use.  It doesn't culturally make sense to use top-down talk to discuss the behavior of a bottom-up org.<p>The TLDR version, is that culturally this whole argument doesn't make any sense in Debian.",1344862411

Ideal for pirates.<p>Modern ship radar systems are ARPA's - Automatic Radar Plotting Aids -  and they only track vessels if you ask them to, they don't automatically identify and track potential collision threats.<p>Avoiding collisions comes down to someone actually looking out the window, and someone (possibly, but not necessarily, the same someone) watching the radar for potential threats, and taking the action of deciding to track them.<p><i>Really</i> modern radar system, like the ones I've been working on for the past 20 years, aren't cleared to run ships because they haven't been ""type certified,"" which means that they aren't ""hardened"" and then tested in the active marine environment.<p>If this happened in an area watched by one of our systems, alarms would have been sounding for around 15 minutes before the actual collision, enough time to take appropriate action.<p>The problems with getting these ""really modern"" systems onto ships are multiple. Your coding standards for desktop or web applications just don't apply, you need something more akin to the coding for space travel. There will often be no one on board capable of diagnosing problems, or even identifying if it's misbehaving. As a result it has to work perfectly, all the time, without maintenance, without attention. Such software is expensive, especially since it's safety critical, and subject to SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) regulations.<p>Net result is it's really, really expensive, and margins in shipping are so tight, no ship owner will install a system when instead, they have to have people on watch who are supposed to accomplish the same tasks.",1344861417

Ideal for pirates.<p>Modern ship radar systems are ARPA's - Automatic Radar Plotting Aids -  and they only track vessels if you ask them to, they don't automatically identify and track potential collision threats.<p>Avoiding collisions comes down to someone actually looking out the window, and someone (possibly, but not necessarily, the same someone) watching the radar for potential threats, and taking the action of deciding to track them.<p><i>Really</i> modern radar system, like the ones I've been working on for the past 20 years, aren't cleared to run ships because they haven't been ""type certified,"" which means that they aren't ""hardened"" and then tested in the active marine environment.<p>If this happened in an area watched by one of our systems, alarms would have been sounding for around 15 minutes before the actual collision, enough time to take appropriate action.<p>The problems with getting these ""really modern"" systems onto ships are multiple. Your coding standards for desktop or web applications just don't apply, you need something more akin to the coding for space travel. There will often be no one on board capable of diagnosing problems, or even identifying if it's misbehaving. As a result it has to work perfectly, all the time, without maintenance, without attention. Such software is expensive, especially since it's safety critical, and subject to SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) regulations.<p>Net result is it's really, really expensive, and margins in shipping are so tight, no ship owner will install a system when instead, they have to have people on watch who are supposed to accomplish the same tasks.<p><i>Added in edit: I see that this, despite having three votes very quickly, is way down on page 3 of the ""front page"" - so it's been flagged.

In no particular order:<p>* The Myth of Uniqueness:  Each and every company doing business believes that their business is different and couldn't possibly be the same as another company's.  This is not completely untrue, but it's also not completely true.  The problem is that this myth is propagated by the enterprise software vendors.  The profit margins on services to customize software is far, far greater than the margins on software licenses.  It is in vendors best interest to promote software customization.<p>* 50 Years of Customization is Hard to Throw Away:  OK, maybe there's not many 50 year old systems running in production any more, but there are 25 year old systems.  The amount of money spent to customize those systems over the years is enormous and big corps are not eager to toss that money spent away to start over.<p>* Database Conversion is Hard:  Not so much difficult, but hard in the sense that it requires many, many hours to first clean up the old database, run the conversion, then validate the new data.  One mistake could mean that someone's policy lapses because the conversion broke the automated Pre-Authorized Cheque processing code for that one client.<p>* Working at Big Corps is Uncool:  Let's face it, being a programmer at a big bank or insurance company is perceived as boring.  The over 40 set that these jobs appeal to aren't traditionally big adopters of new technology.  As these people get promoted into decision making roles, they default to safe, known technologies.<p>* Corporate Partnerships:  Big financial industry companies outsource their IT to corporations like IBM.  These services companies have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.  It's much like bee-keeping bears ;)<p>* The old stuff still works:  Even though the legacy code is unreadable and numbers in the millions of lines, it still mostly works.  The ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" argument is an easy one to make when your executives (beholden to the shareholders) have to make their quarterly numbers.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see start-ups in the financial services software industry pop up with innovative solutions. In fact, I've thought about attempting this myself, given my background.  But the elephant herd of legacy vendors to find your way around is extremely intimidating.  In fact, I actually saw a few small vendors pop up over the years, get small contracts within the big insurance company to do something innovative with their shiny new technology (but not mission critical to the corporation), and then watch that company take on more and more lucrative services contracts further from their core software product.  Eventually, their initial product offering becomes a footnote for them and they turn into something else, legacy related.",1344859453

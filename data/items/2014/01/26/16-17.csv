The author even made an attempt to ensure that different pairs of peers using the same input wouldn&#x27;t generate the same secret by xoring the two usernames together.  Of course, collisions are easy to generate and I don&#x27;t see that the tracker&#x27;s domain is included anywhere, but no serious attacks come to mind through this vector.<p>I&#x27;m not going to bother looking at the Facebook or email methods because the security there reduces to how much you trust your email provider or Facebook.<p>I&#x27;ll keep updating you guys if anyone cares.",1390755596

7125711,comment,7125259,7125259,3,0,dschwartz88,,,"We have three layers of testing in our suite. Ill go from the bottom up (we happen to be a rails shop so use rspec + Capybara):<p>1. Model Tests: These are used to validate base business logic. This is for things like totaling up order values, making sure discounts are applying correctly, and making sure taxes are being correctly applied. These in my opinion are the tests you <i>must</i> have. If you&#x27;re not validating your base business logic theres no way to prove your other testing suites are doing their job. These are done for both Ruby code (rspec) and Javascript code (using Jasmine)<p>2. Controller/API Tests: These are to validate that different parts of the business logic working together actually do what is intended. When a user places an order lots of things must happen (I need to charge them, I need to send them an email, etc.). These are done in rspec and are a nice way of validating things in an orchestration style API (vs. a REST style API).<p>3. Selenium/Acceptance Testing: These are super important. These actually automate what a real user is going to be doing on your site. We test both Admin and normal user flows. These are the easiest to write and give some of the biggest wins. These will catch bugs your users are actually going to encounter. Having model and controller tests for something like checkout are necessary but they <i>must</i> be augmented with acceptance tests or else you can&#x27;t be sure something else isn&#x27;t holding up your user from checking out.<p>Our entire test suite runs on CircleCI (love those guys) but could technically be run on almost any platform (we ran Jenkins for a bit too).

7125692,comment,7125239,7125239,2,0,simonebrunozzi,,,"Hi there,\nhere&#x27;s my humble suggestions:<p>1. It is not easy to add 100,000$ in a year; it is relatively easier to have a long-term strategy to reach that goal over 3-5 years. It&#x27;s not a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon. I say this because if you try and fail after the first year, you should keep doing it until you succeed. To be clear: it&#x27;s easier if your goals become: +20k in 2014, +50k in 2015, +100k in 2016.<p>2. It really depends on where you live, how much access to capital you have, and what your skills are.\n2.1: where you live influences how much you can earn as a freelancer (of course, you can always freelance online, no barriers), how much you pay in taxes, how much business you can find around you. If we assume that you can work online as a software developer and similar, than this doesn&#x27;t apply. Taxation does, though.\n2.2: If you have access to capital, you can try to start a company, and make it profitable; then, sell it. Hard, but if you succeed, you probably can add 100k or more to your income.\n2.3: if you can easily &quot;sell&quot; your skills, consider freelancing or consulting, even though 100k more in a year means a TON of extra work.<p>3. You might want to build something that you can sell; if that&#x27;s successful, the sales can eventually surpass 100k. Examples? An ebook (scales better than a physical book), a software.<p>Problems I&#x27;d like to see solved:<p>1. I&#x27;d like to keep my photos and videos backed up, remotely, automatically; and have a much smaller (disk size) version of them on my computer; this way I can always consult my photo archive, but if I need the original photo, I can still get it from my online backup, from within the app/software.<p>2. I, too (like chegra), would pay to have someone help me buy clothes and dress better, but trust me this is a very hard problem to solve.<p>3. If I have a free weekend, I&#x27;d like a service that, based on my location, budget, and preferences, can suggest me 2-3 things to do with all details (fly to X and do Y, or drive to W and do Z, or drive to X, hike to Y, eat at Z, etc).<p>Hope it helps.",1390755160

7125683,comment,7121140,7123359,1,0,Spearchucker,,,"Seems we&#x27;re not really disagreeing about the reality. We do seem to have different... interpretations, maybe?<p>&quot;<i>The second item specifically highlights documentation cost overhead of traditional methods as a major grievance</i>&quot;<p>Comprehensive documentation may be a major grievance, but it is pales in actual impact on the organisation, team or project when compared with the extortionate cost of discovering a design error during the test phase.<p>&quot;<i>Are we talking about different things when we talk about design?</i>&quot;<p>Two answers. First one is yes, I think we&#x27;re talking about the same thing. Design in the sense that I use it is system design, or architecture. And yes, in a waterfall world that output typically is documentation + diagrams.<p>Second answer? Design how I do it doesn&#x27;t involve documentation at epic war-and-peace proportions. A diagram can be <i>very</i> useful when communicating complex designs to external (to the team) stakeholders. A one-pager with VLAN descriptions and IP addresses can be helpful to a pen tester. However, in my world it&#x27;s about a plan -<p>- What&#x27;s the availability target, and how will it be met?<p>- Is the database relational, document-based, or are we using a lambda architecture? Justification?<p>- What&#x27;s the dev plan? I.e. what feature dependencies exist, and how will they be prioritised? Consider for example a client app that communicates with a USB device. Initially a simple web site might be enough, but ultimately you need to choose between a native app; a daemon that bridges USB and browser via HTML websocks, or a daemon that bridges USB and browser via web site.<p>&quot;<i>although I don&#x27;t view the waterfall process as being predictable</i>&quot;<p>It is extremely predictable in that phases are sequential, and you know exactly which skills are required for each phase. You&#x27;d use a business analyst to elicit requirements, and you&#x27;d not use a tester to write code. That means you can schedule resources across projects horizontally, instead of leaving them on one project until complete.<p>You mention &quot;in any meaningful sense&quot;, and you&#x27;re very, very correct to include that. The point is that waterfall is <i>just as efficient</i> at delivering quality code quickly as any modern agile methodology is. What&#x27;s required is an experienced team.<p>Consider that an inexperienced team will screw up on an agile project just as much as they would on a waterfall project. Here&#x27;s an analogy (taken from a blog post I&#x27;m still working on):<p>--<p>Karate is a martial art. It is also a competitive sport, and has strict rules. Krav Maga is street fighting. Anything goes - no rules, no competitions. I&#x27;ve been doing Krav Maga for over four years, and think it&#x27;s the best self defence system known to man.<p>Saying that Krav Maga is the best is interesting. Not because it really is the best, but because that statement demonstrates two important things:<p>- It demonstrates consistency - my desire to be (and appear to be) consistent with what I have already done. Once we&#x27;ve made a choice, we encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.<p>- It ignores reality - my girlfriend, a 3rd Dan black belt, has been doing Karate for over 18 years. Whether Krav Maga is better than Karate on not is immaterial - she&#x27;d kick my arse from here into next week. The reality is that she&#x27;s simply more experienced. No matter how brutal a counter attack in Krav Maga is, she&#x27;s so fast that there&#x27;s no way I can even block her attack (I know because we spar).<p>--<p>It&#x27;s that concept of experience that I refer to when talking about devs/hackers/programmers growing up.<p>As devs/hackers/programmers I think it serves us well to understand both extremes (waterfall and agile), and move the slider between the two as required. The mix should be appropriate for the team&#x27;s experience. Enough prescriptiveness from waterfall to coach where coaching is needed, and enough agile to ensure that mistakes don&#x27;t become expensive. Common sense should not be ignored when dealing with documentation, TDD, pair programming and the like, and nobody should ever be elected scrum master just because they paid someone for a piece of paper saying they can do it.",1390755077

7125675,comment,7125174,7125496,4,0,omegaham,,,"> Protest?<p>I&#x27;m confused by what they&#x27;re protesting. I do know what their stated aim is - driving Google and other tech companies out of San Francisco. I just don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s the right thing to be protesting. There&#x27;s a shortage of housing because of rent control, restrictions on building new housing, and the fact that San Francisco is a really desirable place to live. The first two are pretty easy to solve - just repeal the laws (The second would be much easier to repeal). I wouldn&#x27;t want to mess with the third.<p>Yelling at tech companies will not do very much. Even if they leave, other rich people will replace them.<p>> Because they can&#x27;t afford to live anymore in a city where they have lived their whole life.<p>It&#x27;s difficult for me to say much other than &quot;Shit happens.&quot; The city is really expensive. Space is scarce, and people are willing to pay a premium for it. I don&#x27;t think that &quot;But I&#x27;ve lived here for my whole life&quot; gives people the right to tell other people, &quot;Sorry, you can&#x27;t live here.&quot; If they owned the land, that would be one thing. But they&#x27;ve <i>rented</i> there for their entire lives. If someone else is willing to pay a higher rent than you, that&#x27;s the way it goes. And that brings us to this:<p>> Maybe they &quot;chose to buy&quot; but could not afford to. And to phrase your sentence correctly, the landlord has legal right to evict the renters, but that says nothing about the renters&#x27; moral right to live there.<p>I could also &quot;choose to buy&quot; a 70-inch television for every room in my house and a new Mercedes-Benz every two years. Just because I make that choice doesn&#x27;t make it a good one. And if the price of a new Mercedes-Benz goes out of my price range, I&#x27;d be on pretty shady ground trying to say, &quot;But I&#x27;ve bought a new Mercedes-Benz every two years for the last thirty years! I have a <i>moral right</i> to get this car!&quot;<p>Lastly, on your comment that people don&#x27;t choose to be poor - this is definitely true. But it just seems so ridiculous that people would defend buying a luxury (in this case, it&#x27;s living in an expensive city) and then accuse their detractors of infringing on some moral right to that luxury. You&#x27;d laugh in my face if I told you that I had a moral right to have that new Mercedes, right?

In other words, it&#x27;s important that we are not dismissive of people&#x27;s feelings or experiences.  But the one thing we must be dismissive of is people&#x27;s efforts to justify dismissiveness.<p>For anyone who thinks that being exclusive is no big deal, it is important that we stand up and be clear that it is important, because that&#x27;s the only way for the group as a whole to truly be welcoming to the out-groups.  Just as we must stand up to overt anti-gay intolerance, we must stand up to more subtle signaling when it is common and pervasive.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that the people who made this program had any bad intentions, and I&#x27;m not meaning in any way to criticize or judge them.  If they are made aware of the issue and don&#x27;t think it matters at first, I can still find compassion because it can take a while to really become aware of why this is important.  But even in feeling compassionate, it is still important that those of us who have come to appreciate this issue stand up and say why we think actions like this are harmful.<p>One final thought: communication &quot;in the large&quot; has different standards than communication with close friends or family.  There would be nothing wrong with a joke like this between good friends or family, for several reasons:<p>1. within a close friend/family group, everyone is already part of the in-group<p>2. within a close friend/family group, mutual concern for each other is already established, and a person who has concerns has ways of voicing them and a reasonable expectation that those concerns will be taken seriously.<p>3. people within a close friend/family group know each other well enough to know how certain comments are intended; the potential for misinterpreting things is much lower.<p>Some of the things my close friends joke around about could sound horrifying and totally inappropriate to people outside our group, but all of us know what we mean by it and are cool with it.  As long as we keep that to ourselves it doesn&#x27;t matter.  But with messaging that will reach a large group of people, it&#x27;s a totally different story.<p>This is much longer than I intended or anticipated, sorry about that.",1390754145

AGPLv3, which is the AGPL that people generally understand to be &#x27;the AGPL&#x27; today, says:<p>&quot;[I]f you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.&quot;<p>Note the absence of any sort of &#x27;nonremovability of features&#x27; implementation of the policy.<p>EDIT:<p>Just an additional point: The current view of RMS and by extension the FSF is that a mere distributor of a version which the distributor has modified must make an effort to have the distributed version comply with that requirement if it did not do so previously (for example, by ensuring that the web application presents some sort of customary offer for source code, though that might not be best practice). There&#x27;s still no &#x27;feature nonremovability&#x27; requirement though.<p>This ended (if not resolved) an argument that had developed last year between me and Bradley Kuhn over whether AGPLv3&#x27;s special requirement imposed any conditions on mere distributors (my view had been that it did not).

This makes no economic sense<p>Of course it makes economic sense. Commie leftists empowered by the legislature brought you rent control. Rent control means onerous limitations on what the property-owner can do with the property, directly reducing his ability to earn money off it and reducing the incentives to build new apartments. It&#x27;s a wealth transfer from landlords to tenants, and no one invests in anything with the goal of having their wealth transferred away. Granted, it&#x27;s certainly not the only thing that stands in the way of new development (but I already mentioned that). Impeding new development means less housing overall, which in turn means more-expensive housing for everyone. \n--<p>But you live in New York. New York City&#x27;s own flirtations with rent control under the War Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1943 are even better studied. Yes, the war emergency is WWII. Yes, that law still governs rent control in New York. (Yes, the DeBlasio would like to see more rent control in more places in practice, as well). And yes, it was destructive. Hell, it&#x27;s the textbook case -- literally, dozens of Intro-to-Econ textbooks. At one point in the 1970s the Department of Buildings noted that over one-third of the buildings in Harlem had abandoned by their landlords. You may also be familiar with the Bronx, burning.<p>If the first paragraph by itself is too tendentious for you, I can also offer you information on the consensus of economists. If you think Milton Friedman and Fredrick Hayek are too capitalist, maybe I could quote Gunnar Myrdal -- a chief architect of Sweden&#x27;s welfare state. &quot;Rent control has in certain Western countries constituted, maybe, the worst example of poor planning by governments lacking courage and vision.&quot; Or Assar Lindbeck, noted socialist: &quot;In many cases rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city—except for bombing.&quot;<p>I will also refer you to papers like Alson, Kearl and Vaughn&#x27;s &quot;Is There a Consensus Among Economists in the 1990’s?&quot; and Block and Walker&#x27;s &quot;Entropy in the Canadian Economics Profession: Sampling Consensus on the Major Issues&quot;. 93% of the American economists and 95% of Canadian economists endorsed the statement that &quot;a ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available.&quot;<p>IN SUMMARY. To deny that rent control is destructive is as intelligent and scientific a statement as endorsing homeopathy, saying vaccines cause autism, and that global warming is caused primarily by sunspots: It&#x27;s a false statement that is at odds with the scientific consensus, and it leads to destructive public policies.",1390753287

Reason the first, if curbside space is oh ever so precious, why can you rent it at the rate of $109/year in the form of a residential parking permit?  I&#x27;m sure Google would be willing to pay $1000/year to designate a half block of RPP spaces to bus loading, and the city would get more money out of it than they get out of the RPP program.<p>Secondly, where are all the protests against Twitters highly subsidized dedicated Muni bus?  That&#x27;s costing an arm and a leg, on top of the huge payroll tax break the city threw at Twitter so they wouldn&#x27;t leave.  Twitter people get paid, too (although God knows why; the company barely has any revenue), and are running up the rents in the Mission just as much as anyone else.",1390752191

And to phrase your sentence correctly, the landlord has <i>legal</i> right to evict the renters, but that says nothing about the renters&#x27; <i>moral</i> right to live there. Remember, everything Hitler did was legal.<p>> If they are angry about that, it seems to me that they are just throwing a fit.<p>By the same logic, if the Jews were angry about the German&#x27;s confiscating their property and killing them, they were just trowing a fit...

Likewise, the fact that you have access to the internet is almost in no way due to your own ingenuity, goodness or hard work, and mainly the consequence of hard-working people that came before you and invented and built the infrastructure, and gave you the opportunity to freely enjoy it.<p>> you should try and find a way to achieve that goal without inflicting pain (stress, wasted time, etc.) on others.<p>While it is perfectly fine, of course, for the others to inflict pain/stress/wasted time on them.<p>Congratulations, your logic is irrefutable!",1390752151

We get married, we choose what to learn, what occupation to pick and what to work on, we choose whom to become friends with. All of those things are done in complete anarchy yet those are all very important things and decisions! No one in the western world who&#x27;s in their right mind would suggest that it&#x27;s a good idea for government to start controlling those things.<p>Now how come I can&#x27;t choose what laws I can live by? I don&#x27;t see people suggesting we all vote for one specific kind of car we are all going to drive for the next 4 years. Yet when it comes to laws it is considered normal that one group suffers because another, slightly more powerful group, wants them to live by their rules.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about examples of societies with no government then there are a couple of those in history (Iceland and Ireland being two of them), but the more important point is that sometimes you don&#x27;t have examples. If you went back to the 17-th century, would you find any example of a country where slavery was outlawed? Yet these days, it is gone almost completely and remains only in illegal forms.",1390752147

138850,comment,138727,138736,0,0,Zev,,,"Is Google still considered a startup though? Sure they may compete in similar markets as startups - they're all 2.0 companies - but does 2.0 always mean startup?<p>Or can a company move on past that and become established without being bought out by some other big company?<p>Oh, and just food for a thought, does this definition make Yahoo a startup with MS trying to acquire them and their stake in web2.0 sits?<p>To avoid going too far off topic though, it seems like there's an ecosystem of programmers and exec's going between the major companies/startups for a few years at a time, how well does this work for innovation - do the same people do the same type of thing all the time with minor tweaks (albeit in different languages/forms), or do people largely try do things differently every time?",1205750395

Usually the set up a handful of experiments, get as close to the original situation as they can (which is often not that close - sometimes they're basing their experiments on movie events and guessing metrics), and give it a go a few times. But that said, the show is about entertainment rather than hard-core scientific vigour, so I'll continue to watch and enjoy :-)",1205750324

Where is the mystery?<p>OK, thinking about it again, it might be a mystery if they did not do it before, using ugly men instead. is it a kind of giving up on the stock market, admitting that for the masses it is just gambling and entertainment?",1205749496

There's nothing in Strunk and White about this.<p>For those of us pedantic enough to want a rule, here it is: The preferred form is ""xkcd"", all lower-case.

Those are the conversations in which 90%+ of how you're perceived is based on body language, tone of voice, etc. If you think for too long about what you're going to say, or get really into what you're talking about and ignore others' lack of interest, or get into debate mode, you'll lose.",1239573421

Most people use them roughly equally, but some use one more than the other.<p>When we were kids, my sister and I used to argue because she thought that her stuffed animals had feelings, and that birds had conversations about specific things.  She was always attributing human emotions to things that didn't have them.  Even now, she does it with her cat: if the cat trips and falls and walks away with its head down, my sister will say, ""Aww, she's embarrassed!"" -- even though cats don't understand embarrassment and the cat is probably just tired.<p>Unsurprisingly, my sister is religious and I'm not.  Religion is what happens when people misapply their people brain to thinking about stuff.  They get a vague sense that the world is alive, and then explain it in whatever concrete terms their culture provides (God, in our case).<p>Nerdiness is what happens when people misapply their stuff brain to thinking about people.  Nerds misinterpret other people because they fail to attribute emotions to them.  However, unlike religious people, nerds usually realize at some point that they have a problem and can try to change.  Except in extreme cases, religious people suffer no consequences for being wrong, so they have no reason to change.<p>Since women tend to be more interested in people and men more interested in stuff, this also explains why women are more often religious, and men are more often nerds.",1239573284

From the purely statistical standpoint, many studies repeatedly showed that verbal intelligence, including the sheer size of one's vocabulary, has one of the highest correlations of any type of test item with overall intelligence as measured by tests containing a wide variety of test items. See for example the book Intelligence in the United States, published around 1958, for ample documentation. On the purely intuitive level, one might say that learning a language, including vocabulary, is for the child like decoding hieroglyphics. The brighter child will master this decoding process far more readily than the average child. Later, of course, one can artificially boost the size of one's vocabulary, but cleverly designed tests of verbal intelligence can get around this problem by relying on somewhat atypical verbal items that one would be unlikely to pick up through a ""vocabulary improvement"" course but that a gifted child would be likely to have picked up if he has been reasonably inquisitive -- and isn't inquisitiveness an important part of intelligence? Finally, to use a computer analogy, a powerful computer without adequate software (analogous to verbal intelligence in humans) would be relatively unproductive no matter how powerful the hardware. -- RKH<p>He has one more test that is publicly posted. <a href=""http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/titan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/titan.html</a>",1239572604

558917,comment,557961,558769,0,0,frig,,,"There's something of an argument for naturalness wrt rows-versus-columns, but it's not conclusive.<p>When it's developed it's usually stated as that a column store encompasses a multiplication of metadata (eg: suppose each row has some kind of row id; you want to support lookup of the value in a given column for a given row; thus in a rowstore you minimally only need one lookup aide (to get you to where that row is) to handle a lookup for any column, but in a column store you arguably need one lookup aide per column (to tell you how to find the point in that column's column store where the value for that row is).<p>It's never been an amazingly compelling argument to me, either, but there it is; the whole thing strikes me as 'semantical confusion', as what we're really talking about (row-vs-column) is a consequence of not taking the relational model to its logical conclusion:<p>- a ""table"" like this:<p>the table T with row = (unique #, column A, column B, column C, ..., column )<p>- is really a materialized view of this view (V):<p>table_A has row (unique #, column A), ...,table_N has (unique #, column N);<p>V = join table_A,...,table_N on 'unique #' in the obvious way<p>...and a column-oriented data store is just a DB that stores data in a more-fully normalized form (often with tricks to minimize or eliminate the need to include the unique# in some or all of the table_Is, keeping just some sort of index).<p>OR: the distinction between row and column stores -- at a high enough level of abstraction -- boils down to questions of how fully-normalized the physical storage's data model is vis-a-vis how normalized the user-facing data model is.<p>In the hard-disk world your choice of physical layout matters a lot; it's possible the evolution of ssds will make the difference between 'row' and 'column' orientation a lot less material (as we've already talked about).<p>The really crazy thing you could consider doing is go one step further and do something like:<p>say T = (unique #, customer_name, library_size (integer)). (library size is like 'how many books does this dude own')<p>Step 1:<p>T -> V like above ( table_a = (unique #, customer_name), table_b = (unique #, library_size))<p>Step 2:<p>- let table_c = (unique_library_size #, library_size), constructed from table_b as basically 'select distinct library_size into table_c'<p>- then let table_b' = (unique #, unique_library_size #)<p>(and a similar transform for table_a, but we'll stick with table_b for now)<p>Doing this is crazy talk on a disk-based system: you're adding a lookup, but for what?<p>But if lookups are essentially free, this has the potential to heavily cut down on the amount of data you need to store (in cases where you have N rows but only K << N distinct values) even before you start applying the obvious compression techniques to the stored data.<p>As datasets grow very large, it'll often be the case that we have K << N; this won't be the case for, eg, google's index of web page contents, but for something like 'how many cases of X did walmart W sell on day D' or 'how many billable seconds was call #1234567 on date DDMMYYYY' it's hard to imagine K isn't << N much of the time for some of the columns.<p>I think that's what the author's trying to very obliquely get at; petabytes might be a stretch, but with sufficiently-cheap lookups a lot of compression-by-indirection may become feasible, which might let you <i>really</i> reduce the amount of persistent storage you need, which'd make ssds extend into workloads you might expect to remain out of cost-effectiveness for much longer.

558898,comment,558627,558848,0,0,philwelch,,,"Atheism isn't a belief any more than fasting is a meal or a bare chest is a shirt. This argument rests on the misconception (bordering on a straw man) that atheism is the positive belief that there are no gods. That's not what atheism is. Atheism is simply the lack of belief in any gods. There is a difference between ""I do not believe that God exists"" (atheism) and ""I do believe that God does not exist"" (so-called ""positive atheism"").<p>Some atheists <i>are</i> positive atheists, but for most of us it's at best a suspicion or a working hypothesis, not a matter of absolute, infallible, unquestioned belief.<p>Even if we are to consider the belief that there are no gods, I would still question whether or not this belief depends on faith any more than the various beliefs that there are gods. If you study the history of philosophy you'll find a number of supposed ""proofs"" of the existence of God. There are also many arguments for the non-existence of God. It's a matter of argument and cautioned reasoning, not faith, whether or not to believe that God exists.<p>Faith is an epistemic position that the atheist does not share. Most atheists tend to acquire beliefs based upon evidence. Just like everyone else, an atheist goes home at night expecting that his house is where he left it that morning. But, just like everyone else, an atheist would be surprised to find that his house had burned down. Yet, after some amount of emotional torment, the atheist would be forced to believe that his house was, in fact, no longer standing.<p>Contrast this with religious belief. A positive atheist, upon coming across some unquestionable evidence of God's existence, would be surprised but would be forced to accept what the evidence has shown. Someone of religious <i>faith</i> would come across unquestionable evidence that God did not exist and refuse to believe it. They would in fact rearrange their entire belief system simply to preserve their non-rational, privileged belief that God exists and will save them from eternal damnation in exchange for their faith.<p>Keep in mind, that is the ideal case. People of faith can be better empiricists than the demands of faith allow them to be, just as empiricists can be more dogmatic than the demands of empiricism allow them to be. But while most atheists consciously choose empiricism (and reject belief in God because there is no good evidence for it), people of faith consciously choose faith. This is the real difference. It's not about God, it's about how people choose to form their beliefs.<p>(OK--let's be more clear here. An atheist can still have faith in something else. For instance, most Buddhists are atheist because of their faith in the possibility of mystical enlightenment and so forth. The real difference isn't between religious people and atheists, but between religious people and secularists. Just as atheists can be religious, secularists can believe in God. Such secularists are known as ""deists"" and many of them did remarkable things, such as writing the Declaration of Independence.)",1239571232

There's also a big difference between group IQ tests, which some states administer alongside achievement tests in elementary school and are basically completely worthless for measuring anything at all, and actual IQ tests, done one on one with a psychologist.<p>Normal IQ tests don't measure very high, to be certified with a 200+ IQ you need to take a test that looks more like a Putnam Competition test than anything else.",1239570902

558886,comment,557961,558380,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"OLTP workloads will certainly be accelerated by SSDs.  They tend to involve a lot of random reads/writes, and the former in particular are massively accelerated by SSDs.  The latter seem to be getting better as the technology matures.  I think there <i>is</i> a question mark over SSD durability during very large quantities of random writes - they erase/rewrite a whole load of data for each small change, so those figures about the amount of data you can write to the disk before it fails might be approached unexpectedly rapidly.<p>Anyway, basically, yes, SSDs are ideal for OLTP, and will likely be fast enough that you can cut back on denormalisation significantly.  The trading of the features of traditional RDBMSs (ACID vs BASE, etc) is often an artifact of database distribution, however, and that won't change with the introduction of SSDs.  OLTP databases that are small enough to fit on one of today's SSDs shouldn't really be a problem for a half-decent existing relational DBMS anyway.<p>Stonebraker was actually involved in a paper that talks about OLTP in main memory, and I would commend that to you: <a href=""http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/vldb07hstore.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/vldb07hstore.pdf</a> .  Main memory has some similar-ish characteristics to SSDs (lowish latency, high transfer rate), so it might be of interest.<p>Sorry if this post is a bit confused, just getting it in before I fall asleep ;).",1239570752

Much of science is still theory, and theories are a very valuable way to help explain things, but they are not 'overwhelming evidence'. Also, this thinking that religion has been forced into a corner is dependent upon the crowd you are a part of (crowd behavior). The opposite crowd might have you thinking the opposite. If an atheist believes without faith, then that means that they are completely sure of everything. Another term for this is close-mindedness.",1239570614

If millions of people take IQ tests, there will be a few who are super-good at whatever they do measure.  Occam's razor says she is one of them.<p>I remember taking an official IQ test in 5th or 6th grade.  One of the questions was how many feet there were in a mile.  I kid you not.  It happened that I was a runner, so I knew a lap around the track was 440 yards.  440 x 4 = 1760, 1760 x 3 = 5280.

The assistantships train students to teach classes and grade papers, and the research and dissertation process teach students how to get an academic paper published. It's optimized for generating new professors (tenure-track or otherwise), and there's not much demand to tailor it in other directions since the dream career of most humanities grad students is being a tenured professor. This is less of a problem in subject areas where entering students already have a different career in mind, e.g. engineering.<p>I won't speculate what those alternative careers could be, but in other improbable fields that attempt to reassert their relevance, applied career paths have a tendency to pop out and eventually be reincorporated into academia as a new, related discipline. For example, psychology has already forked and merged a few times.",1239570449

Most founders will do anything for their startup, but even then, asking someone to move countries is a big request.

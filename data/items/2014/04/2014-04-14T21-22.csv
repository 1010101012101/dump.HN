Your upper bound is 26^4, though if you get a smart attacker, he will figure out that &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;h&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;s&#x27; are all more likely  than &#x27;x&#x27; or &#x27;q&#x27; (though less likely than &#x27;e&#x27; or &#x27;t&#x27;), and prune the search tree accordingly. Honestly, it does not really matter because with just 4 chars long, he can afford to just brute-force it anyways.<p>Example 2: &quot;correcthorsebatterystaple&quot;. While much, much better than &quot;chbs&quot;, 94^25 is completely off-base. That would imply that you are using all printable ASCI characters in your passphrase. The other figure you mention, 250000^4 is closer to the mark, though it implies you are picking your samples from a 25,000 word dictionary.<p>XKCD does not make that assumption, it explicitly uses a small dictionary (2048 words) to let it clear that you do not depend on picking &quot;epic words&quot; for the scheme to stand. You can use simple, every day (e.g. easy to remember) words and still come ahead of the other approach.",1397512790

The Motorola patent portfolio has been discussed, but there&#x27;s a lot of potential for simple expertise in consumer goods that was acquired as well. Us outsiders will never really really know.<p>Since we&#x27;re talking about tech companies and not airlines, the value of an acq is a lot more difficult than discounted future revenue.

The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned Time&#x27;s earlier decision to elect the Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as &quot;Person of the Century&quot;.

In order to power this type system Liquid Haskell depends on a full SMT solver, though, which is a rather large hammer to wield.<p>As it regards to Peano arithmetic in DT languages the Peano naturals data type is awkward for doing math... but FANTASTIC for defining the properties of recursion and induction. Indeed, what you find is that the Peano nats show up everywhere as being a stable foundation for complex proofs and smart recursive functions.<p>It&#x27;s a very similar feature to Haskell&#x27;s lists. Competent Haskell programers do not use lists when they want arrays or vectors—the latter types are naturally far more convenient when in their application space. But lists are not abolished! They&#x27;re fantastically useful as control structures indicating sequential recursion.<p>Typically you think of data types as forming their meaning through construction. You use numbers by constructing them according to arithmetic properties. Another way to do it, though, especially with recursive ADTs and inductive families, is to think of a type&#x27;s meaning as being derived from how you break it down.<p>The canonical way to break down a list is to find some way of combining the head of the list with the broken-down version of the tail of the list. In Haskell that is called foldr<p><pre><code>    --       combiner         zero list   result\n    foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b\n</code></pre>\nand you can see its canonicity by thinking of it as simply replacing the constructors for a list by the arguments to foldr.<p><pre><code>    let ls = Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 Nil)))\n    \n    foldr comb zero ls =\n             comb 1 (comb 2 (comb 3 zero)))</code></pre>",1397511348

7589070,comment,7585186,7588063,6,0,srean,,,"That is precisely the beauty of coroutines: your code can look like threaded code but you can get the performance of an event-loop.  Put another way, with coroutines you get most of the advantages of an event loop but very few of its disadvantages. (You get concurrency only, not parallelism, well this is almost true). For cooperative multi-tasking, threads are unnecessarily resource hungry and wasteful. They hoard resources although most of the time they are doing nothing just waiting. This is usually fine if you think yours is the only application that should be running on the hardware at that time, but typically you want to share the hardware with others.<p>Remember not everybody has the luxury of working on a system where you can spawn 10,000 threads without breaking a sweat.<p>However this territory of literally hundreds of thousands of  programmed agents participating in a game does not seem to be very populated. Perhaps part of the reason is that very few languages had efficient (this eliminates stack copying), scalable and portable support of coroutines. This is starting to change, but not as fast as I would like.<p>I think C is to be blamed for the long under appreciated status of coroutines. It is one abstraction that C left out, although the VM C had as its execution model (the PDP) had excellent support for coroutines at the instruction level. C exported pretty much every abstraction of the underlying instruction set, but not coroutines.<p>EDIT: @VikingCoder Replying here as HN wouldnt allow me to respond till some time has past. Yes I have looked at asio although just scratched the surface. It looks very interesting, as far as I know they are not threads though (which is a good thing), they use macro and template metaprogramming trickery to turn producer-consumers into one big switch case.

I don&#x27;t know the specifics for using C++, Go, Rust, etc. (Disclamer, I&#x27;m a fan of C, and I know some C++ and Rust but little Go). The kernel also doesn&#x27;t get run-time help, so a lot of features of C++, Rust, and Go would be gone right off the bat (Ex. You can&#x27;t be spawning threads in Rust or throwing exceptions in C++ without first setting up your environment, which can be a non-trivial task). Using a subset of any of those languages should work, provided the compiler can provide straight ELF binaries that you could boot (I know g++ and rustc can do this, Go is the only one I wonder about.).<p>If you get to that point, then you have the fact that the C ABI is fairly standard, extremely easy to use, and well-known, so it makes it easy to intermingle assembly and C. If you did it in C++, you&#x27;d definitely want to extern &quot;C&quot; any symbol asm is going to call so it isn&#x27;t mangled, Rust should be the same, no idea on Go (You&#x27;d really also want to extern &quot;C&quot; any user-space system calls, because the name mangling might get in the way.). For the last point, you have to be able to use pointers and write to arbitrary memory locations, which is easy for C and C++, possible in Rust, but I don&#x27;t know about Go.<p>IMO, the code displayed in this example is really hardly a kernel (It <i>is</i>, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything).

So we had our Word doc, Excel spreadsheet for pro forma statements, and the pitch slides.<p>Rendering:<p>I type at roughly 90 wpm and Word Online could not keep up, whole sentences would lag. This is on an i7 with RAM to spare. Also when around 5 editing sessions were open in Word Online, all the sessions would become extremely laggy in all operations.<p>In Excel, navigating around the spreadsheets with arrow keys caused the &quot;active cell&quot; indicator to lag. Sometimes I would arrow over five times and start typing and my typing would appear in the 3rd or 4th cell over from where I was typing.<p>Powerpoint would occasionally display text as black even though the font color was white. I used Segoe UI across the board and on some slides the font would be Segoe while on other slides the font would be a generic Sans Serif. Bullet points would also sporadically get out of line on a slide (imagine some tabbed in, others not) but would be in a straight line in desktop powerpoint. Similar to Word Online, when multiple editing sessions (~4) were occurring on one Powerpoint, the online version would become unusable due to lag.<p>Features:<p>Reading comments online is not a pleasant experience. I appreciate trying to save screen real estate by not displaying comments by default and then restricting them to a side bar, but it is extremely annoying to have to click each and every comment to see what it refers to in the text.<p>If I embed a Table of Contents in desktop Word it would be very nice to update it in the online version.<p>Our Pro Forma sheets in Excel were tightly coupled to our Word document. If I had both Excel and Word open on my desktop I could link the two and update the Word doc with changes in the Excel spreadsheet. The link would die when I closed the desktop versions; this link should still persist! Both documents live in the same folder on OneDrive.<p>A teammate was constantly complaining about some functions missing from Excel Online, I&#x27;m not sure how accurate his complaints were.<p>Editing online should have a Page Layout view; the option to change margins is included. It is tedious to go from editing -> viewing -> editing -> viewing to see how the page will look when printed.<p>General Annoyances:<p>If I deleted a table in desktop Word but another group member was editing the paper, the table would not delete when I &quot;synced&quot;. Similarly with custom formatting of the auto-generated list of References.<p>Although teammates were &quot;signed in&quot; with a MS account, I would still see &quot;$UUID is also editing&quot; instead of their name. Similarly, comments made in Word Online from a signed in account would appear as &quot;Guest&quot;.<p>Even though I have a lot of annoyances and it&#x27;s not feature complete, 365 did make this project run a lot smoother than if we were using Google Docs because of the native Office integration.",1397510319

And if it is, perhaps it&#x27;s cheaper to build walls around cities if the cities are worth saving.  Let&#x27;s say it costs $100 billion to protect NYC - that&#x27;s a cost they&#x27;ll bear.

IMO people should modulate the <i>consequences</i> they are free to impose based on the principle that free speech is valued.<p>There&#x27;s a <i>reason</i> Rockwell&#x27;s famous painting exhibiting freedom of speech is a man standing in a crowded town hall meeting.

The point is that in a free society (as opposed to a free governance), the people at large shouldn&#x27;t need to be told by the government not to ostracize someone who speaks their mind.<p>Your boss imposing consequences for your stupid tongue is one thing.

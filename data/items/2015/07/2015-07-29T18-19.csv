Must: support quick modifications and the addition of extensions as desired (ie. unlimited extensions). 
Must: support landline phones as well as cell phone forwarding.
Must: support Canada & US numbers. 
Must: allow custom availability hours per forwarded number or extension.
Should: allow for easy toggling of numbers/extensions on/off. 
Should: offer landline/VOIP service without needing to go to a traditional telecom. 
Must: allow porting of our existing toll-free number.
Toll free minutes must either be flexible (per minute charge ok) or unlimited.
Must: allow incoming and outgoing calls from the toll free number, via landline and mobile phones. 
Must: allow voicemail for any/all extensions, with notifications when a message is left. 
Must: allow single layer greeting message system. Multi-layer is a bonus. 
Must: allow for custom recorded greetings for all points of the message interface.
Must: allow for important contacts or integrate with a given device’s contacts. 
Should: support something more robust than simple sequential forwarding. Someone having their phone on silent or “declining” a call shouldn’t interfere with the customer rules, and customers should never reach an employee’s personal voicemail rather than the system voicemail. 
Should: support detailed reporting for tracking usage. 
Should: allow recording of all calls.

Landline phones aren’t supported without using another provider.

The simplest and most obvious example mentioned fairly early in the paper is const but there are plenty of others.<p>I can compile nearly any C program using gcc and get correct behavior.  Obviously I can also compile a lot of other things using gcc, including things that are not found in C, and if I do so then I cannot expect any definition of C to specify the resulting behavior.  But most C programs will not compile using the Plan 9 compilers at all, because they do not accept the C language by any meaningful definition.  In the case of const, it&#x27;s also true that many dangerously incorrect programs will compile when using Plan 9&#x27;s compiler, even though any definition of C prohibits that explicitly.  These are qualitative differences.<p>Let&#x27;s be even more concrete.  In case 1, we consider a language exactly like C (pick whatever C you want here), but with the following additional preprocessor symbols always defined:<p><pre><code>    #define _FBEGIN {
    #define _FEND }
</code></pre>
This language allows, but does not require, the use of alternate tokens instead of { and } around function bodies.  Because the tokens are taken from a namespace reserved by the standards, every correct C program is also a correct program in this language, and will have the same behavior.  I submit that one may reasonably claim that a compiler for this language is a C compiler that supports extensions, even though a very limited subset of incorrect programs will fail to compile in a different way than they would when submitted to a C compiler.<p>In case 2, we consider the same language except that in this case the use of { and } around function bodies is not accepted.  Instead, one <i>must</i> use _FBEGIN and _FEND.  I submit that a compiler for this language is not a C compiler, as no (useful) correct C program is accepted by it.<p>What the Plan 9 compiler authors did, repeatedly, reduces to case 2.  There is nothing unethical about creating a new language.  There is something unethical about creating a new language and not only deliberately giving it the same name as a similar (very popular) language, but disingenuously acting as if it <i>were</i> that language.  At best, the implication that all other (again, very popular) standards and implementations of C are wrong simply for not being Plan 9&#x27;s is obnoxiously smug.",1438196126

You&#x27;re continuing to perfectly illustrate two of the points that I&#x27;ve made regarding your hypocrisy:<p>- To paraphrase: &quot;I only want to censor opinions when they disagree with the positions that I hold. It&#x27;s not fair to call (x) a homophobe.&quot; (What happened to Eich was <i>different</i> than calling someone a potentially hurtful label. <i>And, somehow it&#x27;s OK to want to prohibit freedom in others when it comes to their rights (a la gay marriage), but it&#x27;s not OK to lambaste someone else&#x27;s opinion re: that topic.</i>)<p>- &quot;Eich got sacked.&quot; (Aha! Words often spur people on to action.)<p>Note: I don&#x27;t take offense at every use of the word &quot;retard,&quot; as much as you are attempting to lump those that disagree with you, like myself, into the &quot;SJW&quot; camp. I do think that it has little place in a professional setting, or even a casual setting where deeper discourse is the aim. Why intentionally use words that might cause others discomfort, when there are other words that won&#x27;t cause discomfort but will express your point just as clearly?<p>I don&#x27;t know if Github should have taken down the repo, but I don&#x27;t think that disapproving of the use of the word &quot;retarded&quot; is unheard of. Calling someone a &quot;retard&quot; probably won&#x27;t do irreparable harm to that person immediately, but it&#x27;s minimally different than the sort of &quot;bullying&quot; of Eich/Card that you think is <i>just such a travesty.</i><p>EDIT: We&#x27;re talking across one another. I most certainly understand the difference between an explicit call to action, and &quot;calling names.&quot; The argument that I&#x27;m making is that &quot;calling names&quot; often spurs people on to action, or encourages negative groupthink. Throwing around the word &quot;retard&quot; in a professional setting serves what purpose? I personally find little use for the word outside of extremely casual situations with people whom I am very familiar with. I don&#x27;t know to what extent, if any, semi-professionally oriented hosting services should monitor their channels for potentially distasteful humor, but I think that&#x27;s the question at hand re: Github&#x27;s role.<p>To go back to your Eich/Card comparison, I don&#x27;t think that what ended up happening to Eich is completely justified, but I do think that we can&#x27;t prevent the Twitteratti or whomever from having opinions on public people. How can you disapprove of Github stepping in in this instance, while at the same time saying that the public at large should stifle their opinions regarding Eich/Card?<p>And, to add another layer of hypocrisy, how can you tacitly encourage opinions such as those of Eich/Card -- which are inherently stifling of the freedom of others to associate, and is a &quot;hands-on&quot; approach to the lives of others -- while saying that Github should take a &quot;hands-off&quot; role here when it comes to the use of language?",1438195813

MIT Sloane&#x27;s Matt Beane argues that while the hope is that this dialogue will mean safer and more effective robotic procedures in the future, the intense focus on safety and effectiveness has compromised training opportunities for new robotic surgeons, who require many hours of “live” surgical practice time to develop their skills. Beane says that robotic surgery will likely continue to expand in proportion to other methods, given that it allows fewer surgeons to perform surgery with less trauma to the patient, but no matter how safe we make robotic surgical procedures, they will become a luxury available to a very few if we fail to address the sustainability of the practice.",1438195781

And there always will be some asshole who will try to use it against anybody who he doesn&#x27;t like. Then it becomes derogatory. And it starts all over again.<p>They (&quot;r-word campaign&quot;) will just change one word with another word (and burn a bunch of books containing the old word in the process). They will never change how people think.<p>Well, actually... you can remove all negative words from the language like it was suggested by George Orwell in 1984 novel [1].

Frequently, it is used after other parts of the treatment protocol have stopped working.

They are not random access datastores that you can interact with in real time with arbitrary applications.  There&#x27;s not a comparison to be made there.<p>I think the proper comparison is with Amazon S3 and I hope you&#x27;ll allow me to approximate their pricing, on average, to 4-5 cents per GB, per month.  The headline price for storage, of course, is ~3 cents, but you are charged for all outbound data as well as certain IO operations.  I think 4-5 cents is a decent approximation.<p>So ...<p>If you&#x27;re just walking in off the street and getting a small quantity of rsync.net storage, yes, it is 4-5x the price of S3 and you are paying that premium for UNIX-native storage and a phone number / email address that connects you to a real engineer (sometimes me, actually).  Given that, at these smaller quantities, you&#x27;re paying $10 or $20 per month, I think that&#x27;s a very, very high value for the money.<p>If you&#x27;re using larger amounts of storage, the pricing gets down to ~6 cents per GB (assuming annual discount) or even 3 cents per GB at petabyte levels.  So at 10+ TB quantities we are just barely more expensive than S3 and at petabyte quantities we are decidedly cheaper.[1]<p>As always, if you&#x27;re a small end user, email us about the HN discount which is <i>quite substantial</i>.<p>[1] Actually, it&#x27;s even more competitive relative to S3 since, by default, all accounts have 7 daily ZFS snapshots enabled and 1+ TB accounts have 7 daily + 4 weekly.  Those typically add between 20-40% space usage on our end, but you don&#x27;t pay for that ... on S3 you would indeed pay for that retention and you&#x27;d have to roll your own snapshot/retention script/logic.  At rsync.net, Apple-style &quot;time machine&quot; snapshots are &quot;just there&quot;.",1438194117

This is typically handled by choosing a solver that maintains such invariants by construction, e.g., symplectic methods for Hamiltonian systems conserve symplectic 2-form. Adding many floating-point numbers together causes serious problems only in relatively rare cases, unlikely to occur here (e.g., see Higham&#x27;s accuracy and stability book).<p>If I were to guess, the issue is maybe here (<a href=""https://github.com/imeckler/diffgeo/blob/master/Main.elm#L458"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/imeckler/diffgeo/blob/master/Main.elm#L45...</a>), where the direction change is applied when the key is pressed, which means that the direction change doesn&#x27;t happen inside the ODE itself: in effect this might be solving &quot;go straight-tiny turn-go straight-tiny turn...&quot;, which would not be periodic even with perfectly exact solutions. If this is the case, this is like applying a first-order splitting method in which turns are handled with the forward Euler method, which would be quite inaccurate.<p>An extra source of error would be a positive Lyapunov exponent of the geodesic flow. When it is positive, the errors in the geodesic ODE solutions accumulate, causing exponentially large (in time) changes, meaning that the accumulated errors are much more noticeable than in geometries with non-positive Lyapunov exponents of geodesics (e.g., flat geometry would have smaller errors).<p>That said, it&#x27;s not clear that you should actually expect to get periodic case in every case like this.

But like many quickly growing cloud startups, Twilio loses money.<p>In the first half of 2015, the company booked $71.74 million in sales, with cost of revenue of $32.32 million. Those figures leave a gross profit of $39.42 million for the period. Deducting operating expenses and other costs, Twilio had a net loss of $16.370 million in the first six months of 2015.&quot;</i><p>So the first half of the year was $71M in sales, and they are running at an operating loss.<p>They are adding $1M in recurring revenue a week. And we know that it costs them roughly $450K to in costs to service that revenue (cost of revenue).<p>If we add in $1M in recurring revenue a week, for 6 months that is and additional $26M in revenue, maybe $14.3M in additional income (subtracted off the $450K/million cost of revenue), their &#x27;burn rate&#x27; or costs for the first half were 39M + 16M or $55M (that is $39M in gross margin and a $16M net loss), if they keep costs constant (don&#x27;t add head count, same level of capital investment they had in the first half, etc) then we can guess that their costs for the full year would be about $110M, subtracted from their gross revenue (after paying cost of revenue) of $88M they end up losing about $22M for the year.<p>You have a hard time IPO&#x27;ing if your business isn&#x27;t paying for itself. And if it isn&#x27;t paying for itself, you can&#x27;t IPO if you can&#x27;t clearly explain why it eventually <i>will</i> be paying for itself.<p>So the multi-million dollar question which the CEO is no doubt mulling over, is that given the cost of revenue, and the company&#x27;s costs to get that revenue, is there a point where they make money? In my napkin analysis I made a very charitable assumption that their additional revenue won&#x27;t incur any additional costs, but that may be incorrect. They may (or may not) write off their equipment against revenue which is not unusual in accrual based accounting but their corp infrastructure and things like leased space come out of G&A. So either they have a story of how they reduce their costs to make money on existing revenue, or they have a story that new revenue adds more gross margin than costs it consumes, and plot an intercept path to operationally cash flow positive and then net cash flow positive. At THAT point they can IPO and stop thinking like a startup.",1438193206

There is a whole chapter about credit scoring using decision trees, genetic algorithms, and neural networks in Miller&#x27;s 1990 <i>Computer-Aided Financial Analysis</i>.",1438192842

Federal law prohibts organizations from giving money to either.<p>Organizations can pay the expenses for a &quot;captive&quot; PAC (usually in the form of hosting it within their headquarters with all the costs that implies), but that spending is also excluded from reported lobbying numbers.<p>Other than that, you are spot on. Once people realize that lobbying expenditures include salaries and media buys, it&#x27;s not hard to see how the total gets into many millions of dollars.",1438192824

Patent trolls usually go after smaller businesses at first, businesses who could not possibly afford to fight, even if they wanted. The site would allow a business to post their legal case online, and other businesses who face similar exposure, could contribute to the defense fund.<p>The &quot;perk&quot; of contributing would be that you would get access to all of the expert witness prepared statements and legal work, so if a patent troll comes after you next, you would have a lot of your defense work already done for you. Plus, once the patent troll looses a case, especially on appeal, that decision can be used as precedent.",1438192810

645872,comment,645362,645362,0,0,trezor,,,"I know it's cliche by now, and definitely a minor nitpick, but mentioning iTunes as the result of a perfectionist super-critic sounds like madness to anyone who isn't on a Mac. I would argue the Windows-port is the worst (yet successful) software ever engineered, and the only reason I have it, is because I need it for my iPhone (which I agree is a fine product).<p>That said, the general idea conveyed trough the article is interesting. So far people has accepted computers and programs as is with a ""That's just how computers work"" defeatist mentality, but that seems to be changing rapidly these days.",1244378001

I'm the last person to be bothered by harsh online feedback (which would be hypocritical considering I dish out a fair bit of it myself).<p>You can imagine we didn't come up with this name without some thought, and we did do some testing of it before releasing it. Yes, some people will have an immediate adverse reaction to it, but they're a tiny minority, from what we observed. Most are puzzled by the name, but they don't care that much. One advantage we get from this name is that it sounds different from the competition, and so people remember us.<p>It's all about trade-offs.<p>Anyway, the above point was just a tease, I'm fine with feedback in all its forms.",1244377307

I do not know about Harvard, but Oxford which I will assume is not so much different, has most of its graduates from private schools, especially Eton college seems to be their favoured. These kids, due to having the badge of Oxford are quite favoured in the highest ranks of law, politics, etc. I kind of wonder how much different is the teaching in oxford from any other university and if it is so different then why do other universities not adopt their system.<p>Very few people from other backgrounds go to oxford, therefore it is quite a good analogy i'd suggest.",1244376780

As you grow older you learn that other people have the same ideas and what makes them succeed is hard work. In case of science this is called research. Theoretical physicist Albert Einstein did not write about his stroke of genius, he wrote about the years he spent working out the equations. Postmodernism is the language of a group of lazy intellectuals, who thereby fail to become scientists.",1244376602

A name-brand degree is just a pissing match that doesn't matter.<p>4 years of outdated assignments won't much of a difference further out in your life.

645858,comment,645000,645700,0,0,Ardit20,,,"I think in many instances it is more appropriate to call those reasons social rather than cultural. It is the social class which determines the culture, if you are poor, then you reap all the benefits that come with that, i.e. no inspiration from your parents, no due care etc. if you are middle class and upper class the social background sort of determines your aspirations and achievements. On the other hand, the same social class acts as a barrier to mobility for if a kid from a poor background mingles only with other kids from poor backgrounds then he may never find out the different way of thinking or perceiving that kids from middle background have. Therefore, perhaps, there should be a ""cultural"" education for all children. The truth is that we do live in a class society and the sooner children learn it perhaps the better.",1244376119

I suspect, that information gathered systematically to answer the aforementioned questions could be of great public service.<p>Regarding the content, there is so much more to learn about each individual business, than superficial eyeballing. If you start a systematical approach, writing down, for example the top 1K alexa sites, and their respective business model, for any given concept you've got hundreds of sites; not even differentiators defines businesses that sharply. I suspect, that behind each successful business, there's a mix of differentiators, perspective, and way of thinking/measuring; grabbing, and noting these less tangible insights would be the main focus of the site.<p>I don't really consider lawsuits to be a threat -most of the stuff can be figured out by a combination of public announcements + general available info on the net + business logic.<p>> Would I contribute? No, because I would get no value from the site.<p>Your answer presumes, that user contribution is a function of value received from the site; in my experience, this is not so. Yes, there are good-intentioned hippies, but most people are just pushing their own agenda, wrapped in a marketing blanket, which sometimes happen to be aligned with things like ""building a global encyclopedia"".<p>So, to re-iterate the original question: do you think there are people who's business agenda would align with the creation of aforementioned wiki?",1244376053

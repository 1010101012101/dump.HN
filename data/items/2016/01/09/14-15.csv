10871386,comment,10870488,10870902,0,0,ziotom78,,,"Hi dom96,<p>I am a Nim fan too, but I doubt that Nim would fulfill the requirements of the author of this article.<p>At the very beginning of his post, the author says, &quot;[the language] has to be reliable. I can&#x27;t afford to spend my time dealing with bugs I didn&#x27;t cause myself.&quot; One of the main reasons why I abandoned Nim after having used it more or less regularly for a couple of years is that so many things are still changing, and that compiler bugs pop too often. With every new Nim release I have got unexpected problems in recompiling my codes. This is the main reason why, despite still being a Nim lover, I have stopped using it for my projects. AFAIK, there is still no idea when Nim 1.0 will be released; there have been some optimistic announcements of its being imminent, but so far none of them has lead to such a release.<p>Later in the blogpost, the author adds another requirement: <i>I do not want to spend my time porting old games to new platforms, I want to make new games. I need a platform that I am confident will be around for a while.</i> Honestly, I think nobody can be sure where Nim will be a couple of years from now. There is practically just one coder (Araq) which understand the compiler internals, and by his own admission he suffers from a severe NIH syndrome which disperses Nim&#x27;s scarce manpower. As an example, a tool so potentially useful as nimsuggest has been in a non working alpha stage for years because of the lack of people able to work on it (don&#x27;t know if this is still true, though). IMO, this makes the future of Nim uncertain.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I still love the language and wish it can reach a state similar to Rust or Julia (which have a much larger and professional community of developers and are supported financially by a number of players). But I think that promoting it in this thread is a bit out of context: Nim is good when you want to toy with a nice language which gets so many things right (macros!), not when your primary objective is to have some language that just works and can be trusted in the mid-to-long term.",1452350754

There&#x27;s a legal process that allocates the dead person&#x27;s resources according to various factors. Generally a person&#x27;s debts will be satisfied first. Then whatever&#x27;s left gets divided according to the person&#x27;s will, if any. If there is no will, a judge will divide assets up amongst surviving relatives. If there is nothing left after satisfying debts, then heirs get nothing. If there is no will and no heirs, the estate goes to the state.<p>Typically if a person&#x27;s net worth is negative, debts are not passed on to heirs, leaving creditors to sue for relief. Again, jurisdictions vary, and I would expect there are many other factors at play in a country like Japan where keeping the family&#x27;s social standing intact may be worth paying off those the deceased wronged instead of dragging the dead person&#x27;s dirty laundry through the court system even if there&#x27;s no chance of winning.<p>Jurisdictions vary, but I would imagine in a case such as the aforementioned, the state wouldn&#x27;t take the whole estate, only part, after debts are satisfied.<p>A phenomenal article on this aspect of the &quot;what happens after you die&quot; question is this one:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/nyregion/dying-alone-in-new-york-city.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/nyregion/dying-alone-in-ne...</a>",1452349155

I currently work 5 and work in an industry (finance) where 4 earns you more than enough.<p>When I work 4 days with wednesday off, I don&#x27;t even feel like I work... it&#x27;s just a nice part of my life. On monday I think &#x27;man it&#x27;s been days since I did anything productive, I&#x27;m ready to get busy&#x27;. The next day I&#x27;m still in that flow, and the day after I&#x27;ve already got a day off. The same for thursday-friday, and then I&#x27;ve got two days off again.<p>When I work 5 days, on monday I feel glad to get busy again but I&#x27;m also dreading the fact that my immediate future is 5 days of work. By thursday I&#x27;m feeling like I could be productive working fewer hours, and on friday I&#x27;m really glad it&#x27;s over. Further, my weekends and evenings are mostly busy with unwinding from work and preparing for the next working day. Whereas when I work 4 days, my free time is actually time for fun things.<p>I&#x27;m not a big spender, still on a 2010 iPhone 4 for example to give you a sense of where my priorities are at :p My money is slowly piling up.<p>So I could do without the money of the 5th day... but here&#x27;s my issue... While my employer would probably allow 4 days work (which is not standard in and of itself, particularly not in certain industries), I KNOW that I&#x27;d be bottom rank when it comes to promotions. There&#x27;s absolutely no way in hell I&#x27;d ever get a managing position working 4 days, at this company. And in a company of 5k, only the assisting/supporting roles have people working part-time. Supervisors or team leaders etc, all work full-time (or more).<p>I could stay in my current role forever, but it&#x27;d stop being interesting and intellectually challenging fairly soon, and I may develop some bitterness when I get to my 30s or 40s and start getting managed by people younger than me, just because they have a different vision on work-life balance.<p>So I&#x27;m pretty much stuck working 5 days, without being 20% more productive, earning money I don&#x27;t need, because it&#x27;s made abundantly clear that if you ask to work part-time, you can&#x27;t ever work in a function of influence or leadership, at this company. And at most company&#x27;s it&#x27;s a similar story.<p>And I sort of get it... in a world of 5-days a week business and lots of people working 5 days, you wan&#x27;t the manager to be present and available. Whereas assisting/supporting roles can be done by multiple people working part-time. It feels the only thing is left is either to be an entrepreneur or do something special (e.g. lots of jobs as &#x27;special project officer&#x27; that&#x27;s not tied to a m-f 9 to 5), but there&#x27;s no standard path for regular salarymen to work part-time and still have a solid career in line with their productivity & competencies.<p>May I ask where you work?",1452348771

You are a full-time employee who is either very skilled or not as skilled but getting paid in the top 5-10% as a senior or principal software engineer. For a while you get to work on whatever you want to as long as it makes the company better, so you write open source projects, etc. Then, something happens. Either your company gets outside investment, or is bought-out/merges/buys another company, or they fall on hard times, or there is competition, or someone in management reads some new book or goes to some conference, or you just get different management, and now you all of a sudden either have been driven to cut corners which leads to a mess, or morale sucks or people buy into management&#x27;s crappy philosophy which which leads to no innovation and suddenly it feels like no one else is using the crappy libraries and frameworks you had been using, or things for some other reason just suck.<p>In this case, you&#x27;re still making a lot of money. Happy now? Sure you <i>could</i> have found a new job, but wait hold on a second- you are in the top 5-10% so jobs that pay that well may not come as easily. Looks like you&#x27;re fucked.<p>2. You work your ass off as an independent, grow the company, and are doing well working for large company X in NYC. You had an awesome time putting your family through hell in the beginning for peanuts, but somehow you managed to make it past all that.<p>And now, what do you have? You&#x27;re making a lot and have several guys/gals depending on you and you are still working your ass off and now you feel like if you quit, you take all of them down with you. Maybe even you&#x27;re still on your own, but if you quit to take a break, your family will suffer because they won&#x27;t have what they did.<p>What I suggest: do what you believe in as long as you can survive and meet the needs of your family. Push hard or don&#x27;t, but be happy if you can. This will make the world a better place. You may end up making too much and getting into the same predicament, but if you&#x27;re lucky, you&#x27;ll at least not be focused on more money than you need. And if you do get more money than you need- share it. Much good in the world has come from those with money sharing what they have.",1452348646

It seems unlikely foreigners will service Saudi debt without high interest rates and even so, Saudi would not be able to pay it back. If Saudi Arabia can make it to 2025, it seems highly likely the decade of cheap oil will have destroyed the fraking/tar-sands oil company holdouts in the U.S.<p>The House of Saud is one of cards, and they know it. Their social contract is one of regular, large oil payments to citizens, not patriotism. This social contract will die when the money does, and so too will the nation.

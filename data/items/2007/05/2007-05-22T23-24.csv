My understanding that legally all domain names are public property and you can only ""lease it"" for a period of time.<p>However, if you can prove that a certain domain name is the name of your business (and you have a legit, valid business running) and a scumbag like this fucker ""owns"" but does not use your name, you can claim that domain in court. I heard google did this with google.ru in russia: the asshole-domainer who ""owned"" it got nothing.

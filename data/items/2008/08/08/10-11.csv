It looks like the tracks and holes are there for soldering on other I/O connectors if you wish.  Oh, and there's a LED in each of the bottom corners.  ;-)",1218192527

Are price negotiations between the companies we interact with any different?<p>Simply put, the rug sellers understand what they are selling, what people are willing to pay, and how to sell it to them, and these are things all people in <i>business</i> should know.  If win-win can be achieved (client thinks they are getting a bargain and seller is happy with sale price) then all the better. If you buy a rug, are happy with the rug, are happy with the price, what is the problem?<p>It is really market competition, and in many cases desperation, that is the root of the unethical behaviour. I do not agree with using pressure tactics, misleading ""consultative"" selling (was what he was teaching them about rugs true or was it tailored to his needs?), inferior goods supplied (""bait-and-switch""), or the multitude of other things that occur. But I see similar behaviour occurring in many high pressure environments, especially in the financial services sector (some stock brokers come to mind).",1218192112

Unilaterally reduce their wages to slightly below the industry average and see how many stay. Then a rather different motivation will emerge. It is one thing to tell an interviewer that you are an idealist who is not motivated by hard cold cash, but the correlation between successful companies and high wages exists for a very good reason, and it's not that the shareholders didn't feel like so much dividend this year.",1218191794

Including the graphical system (compiz, released 2006) everything in the 2.6 kernel (released 2003) the hardware abstraction layer/project utopia (somewhere around 2003), a new sound system, pulsaudio (2004).<p>And if you take into acount that the start of windows vista's coding cycle lay before the release of windows XP, you might want to include the gstreamer media framework.<p>They've come a long way.<p>P.S.\nThey never bothered to reimplement the security model.

I'd note that the attribution requirement needs to be relaxed sometimes, too. It is a well known problem with the CC-BY family of licenses when applied to art. Mark Pilgrim said it well at <a href=""http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/03/05/cc-dogs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/03/05/cc-dogs</a> :<p><i>Now imagine that every time you upgraded your kernel and rebooted your Linux box, you had to scroll through 741 lines of credits. 741 _additional_ lines of credits, cumulatively. Creative Commons is fine for one-generation remixing. But you quickly hit a wall, either from data degradation, or cumulatively onerous license requirements, or some other damn thing.</i>",1218191150
270417,comment,270145,270145,0,0,johnyzee,,,"I quickly tire of this kind of bargaining, particularly because most sellers' 'friendliness' invariably turns to anything between indifference and hostility as soon as they understand that you are wise to their game and they will not make the tourist premium off of you. On more than one occasion in Turkey, sellers have abused me just because I refused to budge from a price I knew was reasonable (which I had gotten in other shops).<p>At least this is true for tourist destinations. I've had more enjoyable experiences off the beaten tourist path in South East Asia. Generally though, in the long run it grows tiring to have to spend twenty minutes negotiating every time you go in a shop.",1218190969
270415,comment,270145,270381,0,0,chriskelley,,,"I think application of this into a startup is all about interaction.  How can a company passionately (read: more then just newsletter drips) interact with their users after they have signed up for the freeby but maybe aren't quite ready to pay? Even with the ""free plan with hopes of people upgrading to pay"" model so popular these days, conversion rates still seem too low to me.  Users sign up for the freeby but then instead of diving into an engaged relationship with the company, too often those users are ""off the hook"" from courting... they have already shown interest, now wow them into converting.<p>Reciprocation is covered with the company providing the free trial or the free shipping.  In startups, ""Social proof"", ""Liking"", ""Authority"", and ""Scarcity"" are all more-or-less defined by the userbase and market the company is in.  That leaves us with ""Commitment and consistency"" as the magical 'weapon of influence'.   So what is that exactly?  I think it comes back to providing your users with an excellent product, excellent service, and make them feel like they are part of the family.   From a different model, I think Zappos does an excellent job of this.  To loyal Zappos customers, using the service is a no-brainer - at every turn the company makes users feel catered to, and in turn the users will continue to shop and feel confident that the relationship will work like it always has in the past.",1218190219
270414,comment,269585,269904,0,0,rincewind,,,"You ask whats changed about ""desktop Linux"". How is the new graphics system an advantage for users of ""desktop Windows""?<p>The problem with this discussion is the choice Linux users have. You can always say Linux has a poor user experience by referring to the software for Linux you hate most. On the other hand Linux users can say: ""it is just an operating system"" or ""you picked the wrong distro"" or ""don't use fluxbox/emacs/the command line/compiz if you don't like it"".\n You can not not campare apples to oranges when you compare any subset of the GNU/Linux software ecosystem to windows.<p>That being said, the security model in Vista annoys the hell out of everybody I know who uses Vista. Everytime they interact with this new security model, it interrupts their workflow and makes them a little bit frustrated and angry, quite like a fnord.",1218190119

Anyone else had one?",,"Hi there<p>I received an email enquiry from a venture capital firm, which reads as follows:<p>""Hi Adrian,<p><i>My colleague, ######## is interested in SourceGuardian.com and would like to have a quick call to learn about the company and discuss the possibility of OpenView Venture Partners making a future investment in the company.<p>Do you have time for a brief call? Please let me know a couple of times that work well for your schedule.""</i><p>I've never heard of them and a quick web search shows that they're based in Boston, have made investments, but a few results also show that it appears they've been sending out these emails in bulk.  Has anyone else had one of these or know anything about the firm?  Investment, or actually selling SourceGuardian, is something I've been thinking of, however I'm unsure whether OpenView Partners are the people I should be speaking with.<p>If anyone has any knowledge of them, please share<p>Thanks<p>Ade",1218189808

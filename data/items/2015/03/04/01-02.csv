I stop short of fully endorsing it because it postulates a lot of things without much appeal to real science, despite portraying itself as scientific. In particular, I&#x27;m not sure how much of the brains characteristics can truly be attributed to fractal extrapolation of (idealized) behavior of individual neurons.<p>That complaint aside, at the consciousness level, I do think the multiple agent idea is an interesting framework for thinking about the brain. When I was in middle school, I suffered from paralyzing self-consiousness, which in retrospect was probably due to high levels of anxiety. At that age, I had come to think of my non-stop inner dialog and cacophony of voiceless mental urges as being like an internal parliament. In my later teenage years, number of stressful shocks to my system caused me to enter a period of depression, but I think it also gave me an opportunity to disrupt the mental patterns I had developed. Emergence from that depression, and I think also the inhibition lowering effects of alcohol, gave me a chance to reorganize my mental pattern in a way that gave my &quot;self&quot; more agency, and less to my various urges. Well, aside from my urge to use alcohol, which I would have to come to grips with years later.<p>I would later have another depressive episode, followed by another period of plasticity where I think I was able to really alter my mindset and habits. These depressions I experienced felt in many ways like an agent that hijacked many of my mental processes that normally felt under control of my conscious self, like my feeling of motivation, my emotions, and my thought patterns, rendering my conscious self frustratingly powerless.<p>Putting my scientist hat back on, it&#x27;s tough to tell how much my personal experience and the tidy explanation of some psychological disorders and phenomena indicate a reality of a hierarchy of more or less discrete agencies.",1425433408

I think it&#x27;s reasonable to have a physical theory that seems like nonsense, so long as the theory passes experimental tests and there&#x27;s no better theory that does. Why should we expect tiny tiny bits of the universe to be unsurprising to relatively gigantic inhabitants, etc? Whereas my lay impression of The Landscape, the Anthropic Principle, and so on, is that they seem like so much flailing around in the dark, and can support the author&#x27;s case a lot better - the accusation of neurotic ritual behaviour seems to find more fertile ground with proponents of untestable theories than with those espousing well-tested but absurd-seeming ones.<p>Though Platonism is a common enough accusation, I wonder if the author is really objecting to Pythagoreanism, whose adherents profess: &quot;all things that are, are numbers&quot; - a narrower claim than Plato&#x27;s ideal realm, perhaps, and so maybe an easier target. After all, at least one Pythagorean was neurotically (if apocryphally) murdered for revealing the embarrassing incommensurability of the square root of two, which goes well with the article&#x27;s thesis.",1425432756

BUT I have to say something about this video.  I&#x27;m from Alaska and do lots of backcountry snowboarding so this kind of stuff probably doesn&#x27;t matter to most people but this video is laughable for a few reasons:<p>> guy reminiscing about a memorable camping trip with friends yet can&#x27;t remember how to get there.<p>> driving a classic mercedes with rear wheel drive on slick snowy roads.<p>> using ancient snowshoes that should be hung on a wall as a decoration and not actually used while wearing other completely inappropriate clothing.<p>> cool, your watch let you know it&#x27;s -12c hopefully your ears won&#x27;t be frostbitten off by the time you&#x27;re done wandering around in the backcountry by yourself without a hat. (wouldn&#x27;t want to mess up that stylish hair do)<p>> a watch whose battery will only last a couple days is probably not the best thing to depend on for an overnight trip in the backcountry.<p>> using google now as if he would have cell data coverage in the backcountry.<p>I know I&#x27;m being a bit harsh and I&#x27;m probably not the target audience for this video.<p>But my honest impression based on that ad is that people who use this watch are fashionable city slickers who have no idea what they are doing and use completely impractical even dangerously outdated equipment in order to look fashionable.<p>What would actually appeal to me?<p>>Guy hauling ass on his mountain bike/snowboard/skiis.<p>>He checks his watch to view his heartrate/trail data on an app like <a href=""http://www.strava.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strava.com/</a> .<p>>App indicates relevant data like current heart rate, average speed, trail location.<p>>scene cuts to end of his ride where the app indicates he has just set both a new personal record for that trail and that he is also the new recordholder.<p>>Guy is back at his car.  Watch indicates he has a fancy dinner appointment in one hour.<p>> Scene cuts to him changed into fancy clothes and putting on his nice blazer/spiffy trenchcoat.  His watch indicates that he should leave now in order to get to the appointment on time complete with a map and directions.<p>>guy is seen at dinner with watch displaying a classy watchface showing off that it is suitable to be worn with formal attire.<p>ad ends.",1425430931

Instead of constantly polling or faffing about with third party servers, one phone could simply initiate a two-way connection to another phone the old fashioned way: via phone call. There&#x27;s your &quot;push messaging&quot;. You wouldn&#x27;t even have to leave your data on. Your text messages would also probably arrive <i>faster</i> than an SMS.<p>I&#x27;m very disappointed that despite <i>numerous</i> papers on the subject in the past decade (even a DEFCON presentation), no implementation has yet appeared, not even a demo.",1425430863

Read the lines that follow:<p><i>they can intermediate user click through on Google search results so Google doesnt see the actual user behavior. Googles whole play of promoting Android in order to aggregate user behavior patterns to sell to advertisers is completely subverted by Amazons intermediation.</i><p>Google's business model is to spend a metric ton of money on servers and software in order to deliver a better search engine than anyone else. They do so in order to attract users. Part of the payoff is that Google gets detailed data on user behavior -- what they search for, what they click on -- and uses that to increase their value to advertisers.<p>Well, now Amazon has a brand-new potential business model: They've put a man in the middle between the customer and Google. They serve the customer the search results that Google is paying to generate, and they capture all the same data about customer behavior that Google gets. To the extent that Google's tracking data has any value, Amazon has just acquired that value, all in exchange for merely proxying a search engine that Google builds and maintains ""on Google's dime"".<p>Of course, any browser vendor could do the same. But if Apple built a phone-home feature into Safari that uploaded your clickstream (including, perhaps, the decrypted end of your SSL connections?) directly to Apple headquarters they would be roasted alive -- rhetorically, anyway -- by every geek on earth. Presumably we should give the same scrutiny to this move by Amazon.",1317247186

Your path to a coffee shop is generally shorter than your path to a library.<p>This problem gets even worse when you add the dimension of time. Libraries are closed a lot. Philistines keep cutting their funding, and they respond by shortening their hours. Unless your working hours coincide neatly with library opening hours you'll sometimes need an alternative.<p>Finally, there's the social dimension. It's not easy to start a random conversation in a library, and it's essentially impossible to answer the phone. (Unless you are a big jerk <i>and</i> your local librarians are insufficiently ruthless.) Now, if you're trying to program such an environment is a godsend, but if you're trying to run a business programming is often the least of your problems. You have to do sales and marketing and client management and the occasional round of procurement or insurance shopping or whatnot, any or all of which may require you to talk on the phone occasionally.<p>That said, whenever I'm near a library during its opening hours I head over there instead of towards the coffee shop.

Search for ""tricycline quack"", get results for ""tri cyclen"" and ""ortho tricyclin"".<p>05/23/2011 Search Google Images for ""cloudmin screenshots"", get 423 results, not a single one is a screenshot of the Cloudmin interface.<p>05/23/2011 Search Google for ""VZManager"", get results for ""VZAccess Manager"", with ""VZAccess Manager"" hilited in the results as the search term I was looking for.<p>05/24/2011 Search Google for ""480vs factory reset"" (need to see if anyone's mentioned how to reset a piece of equipment whose model is ""480vs""), get results for ""480 vs factory reset"", including things like ""5970 vs GTX 480 vs 5870"". A simple ""nothing found"" would have been better.<p>05/24/2011 Try ""+480vs factory reset"", get a few results from content farms with automatically generated content for longtail searches like this. I know this is a constant struggle for Google, so no points deducted here.<p>05/27/2011 Search for ""rebuild program list start menu"", get results from microtrendsecurity.com, a splog.<p>05/30/2011 Search for ""consrv.dll"", get results for ""winsrv.dll"".<p>06/07/2011 Google product search for ""seagate freeagent goflex""; supposedly available for $76, lowest actual base price for any of them is $97.35.<p>06/29/2011 (I gave up updating the file for a while) Search for ""mysql log fail starting"" (which was a search suggestion, btw), get results for ""mysql log file starting"" instead. Also, didn't realize at first that it was giving me stuff I didn't ask for, because of a UI issue: the format of the warning at the top is too similar to the font & size of the search results, so it took me a few clicks to realize what was going on. (Also, I'm an idiot. But, as in this case, I also tend to rely on Google when I'm in a hurry, and I'm more inclined to be an idiot when I'm in a hurry.)<p>07/08/2011 Search for ""mac .ai"", keep getting search suggestions for ""mac.com..."", and if I fat-finger the arrow keys, then I have to go back and fix my search query. Extremely annoying.<p>07/21/2011 Search for ""national instruments compromised"", since they were, get results for Ni-Cad batteries.<p>08/19/2011 Search for ""debian Module ip_set not found"", get results for ipsec.<p>09/12/2011 Search for ""mountain hardwear shirts"", Google thinks you misspelled ""shorts"". This one got a laugh out of the household. :-)<p>...This isn't at all an exhaustive list of the Google annoyances I've run across, and it doesn't (mostly) include UI stuff that may be more subjective (like Google Instant, which is just plain miserable on older hardware). I've also edited the tone a lot -- some of these happen when I'm under the gun, trying to get more information on a problem possibly involving downtime somewhere, and that can be a really bad time to have to start fighting with Google -- a tool that, once upon a time, I trusted a lot.<p>Frustrations with search results similar to the examples here is at least a weekly, if not daily occurrence. When I see cool new Google projects like Google Plus, while search results continue to <i>feel</i> more and more like 1999 Altavista, I stop having warm fuzzy feelings about Google's dedication to search. Intellectually, I know you guys work hard on it, and I know you personally have compared current search results to much older ones, and found the current ones to be much better. But when I search for ""shirts"" and get results for ""shorts"" ... it kinda feels like something went wrong somewhere.",1317245583

WM_DESTROY, on the other hand, would be a protected method that can only be evoked by the window system.""<p>Yeah well there's the error in your thinking, and exactly what the OP was about: window messages aren't that. <i>Every</i> message is a callback, a 'notification' if you will. If you call RegisterClass() and pass a WNDPROC that does nothing (ignores all messages), it can still be created/destroyed with CreateWindow()/DestroyWindow(), and the 'notifications' it gets (WM_CLOSE and WM_DESTROY) can happily be ignored ('happily' as far as the window manager is concerned).<p>Win32 is <i>not</i> an OO API, and thinking of it too much in those terms will cause all sorts of confusion. Win32 is a C api, and yes things like MFC put an OO wrapper around it, but at some point the abstraction <i>will</i> start to leak if you take it to the extreme without thinking about the underlying system. Win32 is based around the OS calling back into your code through a well-defined callback function (the WNDPROC), a function with a fixed signature, and taking two arguments that are for all intents and purposes void*'s. The message ('WM_xxx') is a way to tell you how to interpret its arguments, and inform you about changes in the life cycle or state of the window. Everything else (like being able to 'send' messages to HWND's and make them behave in a certain way) comes from there, and much of it is convention - which often works, but when it doesn't, it's not the design's 'fault'.",1317245312

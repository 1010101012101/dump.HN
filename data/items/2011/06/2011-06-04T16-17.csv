Sure, they want to make sure it's not widespread, and the constant treadmill of crack-and-patch is enough to keep the hoi polloi from trying it.

2619782,comment,2617807,2618525,4,0,SwellJoe,,,"SourceForge is both a business and a project...the project was created because the people behind it wanted to build something for the Open Source community. They succeeded, and achieved remarkable things. If you weren't around the Open Source community ten or more years ago, you might be forgiven for not giving them their due credit. But, I was around, and I'm grateful for what SourceForge has provided, and still provides, the projects I've worked on over the years. If they got lost on the way to finding a workable business model, or if they failed to keep pace with the rapidly-changing Open Source landscape, that's certainly worth talking about...but heaping hate on people who've tried to do good things for the community for <i>years</i> is low and nasty and it's something I don't like to see.<p>Most of the people who use, and have used, SourceForge have never paid for the service. If someone hasn't paid for it, and hasn't contributed to it in any real way, I don't see how it's right for them to complain about it in an obnoxious way (angrily on twitter or reddit or whatever). Send a patch to fix the problem, submit a ticket, etc. But, spewing anger without having done anything to help just makes someone a cancer on the Open Source community. If you don't like SourceForge, don't use it. But, don't pile hate onto someone that's done good things and continues to do good things.<p>I absolutely understand where the SF folks are coming from. Sometimes, I feel this way, too. When you have a project with millions of users, there's going to be someone who can't help but heap hate and anger on you; it's human nature, I guess. In this case, though, it seems even worse...because folks are kicking SourceForge when they're already on the ground trying to figure out WTF to do to regain some of their old luster.<p>I'm pretty much certain they aren't talking about ""customer complaints"" here. I'm sure they don't mind that kind of thing; they've been dealing with it for over a decade. I'm pretty sure what they're talking about are the ""SourceForge sucks!"" type rants about how evil SourceForge is. And, on that count, they're right to be upset.",1307205649

At the beginning I was constantly ""punished"" during religious-courses because of my questions, but the punition was to be in the library while the other kids had religious classes, so I can't disturb the class and make everyone questionning what the teacher says. Soon they didn't wait for me to ask an embarassing questions they'd just make me go to the library during religious-courses.<p>You could think that people at this school were rather clever to have me ""punished"" by being in the library. But they also sent me to the ""school director class"" when I was talking too much in class, and the school director class was for kids 3 years older than me, and they were doing way more interesting stuff. Even if I was not allowed to ask questions there, I often managed to get punished on purpose (it was really not difficult for me ^^) and it seems they never understood that.",1307204425

I keep thinking that -eventually- the market will find it's equilibrium with regards to price/quality for serious projects. Budding entrepreneurs get on these sites, post something, and get screwed by one of these $5/hr people (often and likely, not every time I admit). You would think that they learn by their mistake and come back the second time with different expectations in price and quality. However, there must be an endless supply of budding ""entrepreneurs"" as I have not seen any leveling off yet.<p>I use oDesk and Elance. I have looked at, yes many, other sites but the signal to noise ration is just so low and there are only so many hours in the day. I have had much more success finding serious projects on oDesk more so than Elance. I'm curious what others have experienced. And jwwest, you are absolutely right. There are many projects posted that clearly are not intended to proceed. You can't always tell from the post alone.

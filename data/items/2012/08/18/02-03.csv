If Samsung can't pay Apple, that means they're not making enough money on their phones.<p>Samsung and all Android phone makers are fighting a losing battle as long as they keep such low profit margins.  It's the failure of the licensing of one common OS for all phones.  Nothing distinguishes these phones enough to allow one company to raise above the rest.<p>Samsung and the other Android phone makers can't count on anyone's loyalty.  The Android user is only interested in the freest phone, regardless who makes it.  Today Samsung, tomorrow X (fill in the mark).<p>Why does Apple have to support that?",1345258792
4400051,comment,4399430,4399989,12,0,mdwrigh2,,,"> Let's be even more clear: there isn't a genuine equivalence between Apple suing Samsung and Samsung suing Apple.<p>Point me to where I said anything about this case other than ""Apple, on the other hand, has been suing every Android manufacturer under the sun with the full intention of destroying Android."", which I think is nearly inarguable at this point.<p>> Even Google's lawyers told Samsung to change their designs.<p>While Google did tell Samsung to change their design, I have no reason to believe that it was their lawyers (and thus had any legal weight, which is what ""Google's lawyers"" implies).<p>> The false equivalence that you and many other people continually try to draw in this thread and every other one like it has poisoned the well.<p>While I'm glad you've studied your rhetorical devices, can you explain what false equivalence I'm drawing? If it's Samsung v. Apple and Apple v. Samsung, see above. I didn't say anything about these cases, particularly about Samsung suing Apple.<p>I'll also note your response didn't contain any evidence of Google being unwilling to end this (or of Apple being willing to, but I didn't ask for that).<p>> Nokia sues Apple over something? No big deal.<p>Didn't mention this, please don't put others opinions in my mouth.<p>> Apple sues Samsung over obvious copycat products? End of world.<p>Didn't specifically mention this case anywhere.<p>> Apple writes $10 bln check to Nokia without much fuss? Serves em right!<p>Didn't mention this, at all. Anywhere.<p>> Samsung might owe Apple a couple billion? End of world.<p>Didn't mention this.<p>Please don't paint me with the brush of others. I make the comments in the context of my opinions, not others.<p>> Google et al. made conscious decisions to copy Apple's products.<p>Then why hasn't Apple sued Google directly? It's their software, yet Apple only goes after manufacturers.<p>> In that case, Fuck Samsung and Googlerola -- they can write checks just like Apple did to Nokia. Hardly the end of the world.<p>Again, show me that Apple has approached Google about licensing it's patents, or is even open to it. They aren't looking for a check, they're looking for the eradication of the platform. I'm going to ignore Samsung -- I'm not talking about them here, only you are.",1345258730

Sure, competition from a number of different fronts is really great, but I think what made Java tick for a long time was JBoss and Spring. For Ruby, it is Rails. I'm sure Python has Django and others.<p>Clearly lots of people are working on it, but a powerhouse framework for NodeJS just hasn't surfaced quite yet. The OP's mention of security being bolted on as an afterthought really is something that makes me shudder. I can't imagine building a large scale public facing system without method level access control. I fear a whole new generation of injection type attacks against NodeJS frameworks.<p>While it is fun to play with all the shiny new NodeJS toys, I don't see why sticking with tried and true on the backend (take your pick of Python / Ruby / Java) is such a big deal. A lot of the cool features that are being touted in the NodeJS frameworks have been already done elsewhere for much longer.<p>For me, I've really successfully used NodeJS in one area where it really shines... scraping web pages... but that is simply because working with a jquery-like interface to the DOM, on the server side, is amazing.<p>In the end, it seems like if you're bootstrapping a company / product (like many of us here are) and trying to pick what to use for your base platform, the obvious choice is building features instead of building frameworks. This means you stick with the tried and true and hope that in the future, the shiny new toys mature a bit more before you go down that path.",1345257923

I'm not sure it hurts on HN, but it doesn't seem to solve the core problem, either.<p>I think it does come down to a social problem being tackled by technical solutions. It may be that the only way to make this problem go away is to empower moderators (of which HN has more than a few) to simply remove the most negative stuff before it has a chance to alter the tenor of a thread.

4399928,comment,4399827,4399827,3,0,jmspring,,,"Node.JS is a decent platform for developing on, if you know the caveats.  You have to be very careful with the modules and frameworks you use -- as mentioned in the article, maturity of modules varies.<p>I know people that have had issues with socket.io and skipped it (and node.js) for their production needs.  That said, my aha, gotta be careful, moment was when I was setting up a quick test, picked one of the http-digest auth modules, and had a bug -- actually a completely incorrect digest auth implementation (basic auth was fine).  This was the second node.js module implementing digest auth that I used that had a bug that relatively simple testing would have found.  (The other bug was around the caching/lifecycle of nonces.)<p>I plan on going back and submitting patches for both of these modules, but the lack of basic testing in two cases of a well known (and documented) feature reminded me that the platform is still in transition.  (This is just one example of some issues I've run into)<p>Why I say you have to be careful?  For the downsides, there are definite upsides.  I needed a simple test https server w/ a rest API and serving a static file -- total lines of code, about 25.  A great boon to prototyping.<p>Like any new framework, evaluate it in consideration with your needs.",1345256126

It's apparently fairly common for management in PE-led turnaround deals, but I've never heard of it in startups except for the Skype deal.<p>(What shocked me was that a16z was in on the deal as well, and as far as I can tell, had no problem with it.  I would have expected better.)<p>I think it is exceedingly unlikely such a clause is in OnLive employment agreements.  Steve Perlman is a particularly honorable entrepreneur who has been involved in startups longer than a lot of HN users have been alive.  He has nothing to gain by tarnishing his reputation like that.<p>Much more likely this was just a company which ran out of money, has debts and liquidity preference far in excess of assets, and thus all common stockholders, including optionholders, are wiped out.

Nobody disputes that a good user experience is important. This is why people specialize in it. Now, just taking you at your word that you do in fact design and code amazing experiences- obviously most developers are not as highly skilled as you. If I want to build a good product, it's going to be very hard to find someone as amazingly talented as you. I am left with the choice of hiring a good developer and a good designer and building a good product. Sounds good to me. This is why the profession exists.<p>If I can find a UX designer who is also skilled at visual design (more common than one who is also a full fledged developer), the product will also look good.

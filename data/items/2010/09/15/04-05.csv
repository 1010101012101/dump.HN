In the absence of any further comment from Google, I'd be very interested to see some journalists doing some investigation here.<p>Assuming that this is real and not mis-reporting or user error, I'm guessing Google links using either their google.com cookie, IP address and/or browser identification.

Part of the sigma attached to cannabis smoking is directly linked to its ""illegal"" nature and misinformation spread by the highest parts of our government and media.<p>Take the DEA controlled substance scheduling which places cannabis as a schedule 1 drug:\n(1) Schedule I.—\n(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.\n(B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\n(C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.""<p>Science can and has refuted all 3 points, yet we're still having debate over the extreme dangers of legalization. Clearly something is irrational here as well when a plant that has not directly killed a single human being or cause violent withdrawal symptoms sits at a higher schedule than opium, cocaine, PCP and benzodiazepines.

1693309,comment,1691589,1693008,0,0,sophacles,,,"Identity theft is a real theft. When I copy a song, or a bit of data or whatnot, and then use it, the only consequence to the copyright holder is potential loss of a sale. A sale is not something that is guaranteed -- a sale not made does not take something from the owner. If an unmade sale was in any way theft, then rude sales clerks would constantly be going to jail for theft.<p>Identity theft on the other hand does real damage to people. A stolen identity has components of ""potential damage"", this is true. It also doesn't change the fact that damage is realized -- changes to credit situations cause real life fees and interest rate changes. Withdrawals from bank accounts are real, not hypothetical losses to the original person.<p>Once again, there is a difference between ""causes a loss"" and ""does not cause an increase"". Theft is simply causes a loss.<p>Are you now going to claim that withdrawals from bank accounts don't actually count either, they are after all just data being copied around.<p>As for: <i>Copyright infringement takes away the credibility of the content holder and reduces the value of that content.</i> : Are you sure it isn't that copyright artificially inflates the value of content?<p>Now about your last statement: you and every other person would try to poach the leaders. Here is the fundamental flaw with that business model: should someone be actually innovative, you could never catch them. You would constantly be losing to them because by the time you get the copy working, they have moved on to the next step of progress leaving you and your competitors to fight over the scraps.<p>The welfare thing: copyright is assistance handed out by the government, in the form of ""if you are stupid enough to base your earnings on something easily copyable, we'll force people to pay you anyway."" Police on the other hand are there to stop people from causing harm to another. Most of the scope of that is outside of the realm of copyright by a long shot. The little overlapping bit is this: when my property is stolen (actual property, earned an in existence, not the hypothetical copyright stuff) they deal with it. This is not the government giving me a handout, it is them providing a service I pay them for. (Welfare programs are the government giving you a service I pay for).",1284524658

It is double what I pay my team in the Philippines, and considering that the average monthly wage in Belarus is under $150/month, it is quite generous (I paid him a month's wage for 3 days' work).<p>Would you react the same way if a Silicon Valley company hired a developer in rural Mississippi (the state with the lowest median salary) for $35,000 (the median salary there) instead of hiring locally for $150,000?  Is that exploitation?  Remember that the cost of living there is much lower, so he will enjoy a much better standard of living on a lower salary.",1284523751

I don't know the details, but I'm guessing the following were factors:<p>* Six Apart already owns/maintains Typepad and Movable Type. So there may have been some product overlap/redundancy (I believe Vox accounts can be migrated to free Typepad accounts)<p>* Six Apart has already sold off another of their properties, LiveJournal. So Vox may be another attempt to shed and streamline their overall business. In this case they are closing down the service unlike LJ (maybe they couldn't find a buyer?)<p>* Tumblr and Posterous as well as Twitter have largely ""won"" the social blogging war (microblogging in the case of Twitter). I don't think Vox ever had the traction of either of those products and in the economic downturn it may be time to cut their losses.<p>Just my $.02",1284523343

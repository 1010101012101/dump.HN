3938973,comment,3938566,3938566,2,0,copx,,,"I do think that FP IS a snake oil fad and unsuitable for 90% of all code, which is all about mutable state and IO: manipulating data bases and game worlds, writing and reading files, sending and receiving network packages, user interaction etc. all of which is awkward in FP.<p>Back then OOP was paraded around as the silver bullet of software engineering some people rightfully pointed out that many problems do not map cleanly to OO abstractions. People tried to force all code into that straightjacket anyway, most infamously Java, and thus we ended up with things like ""Singleton""s and ""AbstractFactoryFactory""s.<p>Yet OOP was a success, because most problems can be expressed in a decent to good way using that paradigm, and it forced some structure on bad programmers. In contrast, most problems can not be expressed in a straightforward way in FP and the advantage of forcing structure on bad programmers is mostly gone.<p>I think the current FP fad is actually an unfortunate side effect (pun intended) of the OOP craze. All these younger programmers who learned programming with Java, who had to write all that AbstractFactoryFactory ""Enterprise Java"" code, they see FP examples and think they have seen the light.<p>As the article almost admits, FP is basically a restricted subset of procedural programming. However, while these people were taught that ""procedural programming"" is an archaic evil and everything must be wrapped into classes by their Java schools, nobody told them that about FP (because the instructors probably did not even consider/know it). So now they can enjoy the simplicity and freedom of procedural code without the feeling of being ""politically incorrect"".<p>However, as I said, FP is simply unsuitable for most real world problems. The problematic thing about Haskell is not understanding monads, it's that they are necessary! They and other constructs like that are the ""Singleton""s and ""AbstractFactoryFactory""s of FP - what happens if you try to force something naturally ""unfunctional"" into a functional straightjacket.<p>The right solution is multi-paradigm programming. Use FP where it makes sense, don't use it where it doesn't.",1336399055

The following packets are all encrypted, but any or all may be lost.<p>1) first general sends: ""Let's both be in state 1 tomorrow (coordinated attack).  Since an uncoordinated attack is so catastrophic to us, I will only enter state 1 if I receive your reply.  Please include the random number 25984357892 in your reply.  As soon as I get this the attack is ON.  If I don't get such a packet within the hour I will assume this post was intercepted (lost), and I will send another.   I will remain in state 0 until I receive that packet.""<p>2) second general sends: ""Got your packet with 25984357892.  This is my acknowledgment!  I will attack as well.  In case you don't get this, I know you won't attack thinking I didn't get your message, so I am sending this message continuously.""<p>Great.  But what if all messages from the second to the first are intercepted.  Now the first thinks all of HIS were intercepted (has received no acks) and doesn't attack, but the second one does.  Failure.<p>So, we have to emend 2) to:<p>2) second general sends: ""Got your packet with 25984357892.  This is my acknowledgment!  I will attack as well.  In case you don't get this, I know you won't attack thinking I didn't get your message, so I am sending this message continuously.  In case you don't get any of THESE messages, however, I will not attack.  Therefore acknowledge ANY of them with random number 458972984323...""<p>Ooops.  What if all the first general's ack's of the acks are intercepted or lost?  (Perhaps the first general is able to send messages until receiving (2), but just as the first general gets 2) conditions change and the general no longer has any of his messages delivered.)<p>Now the first general thinks he has acknowledged the ack, but the second general doesn't even know if his ack-(cum-request-for-an-ack-back) message was even delivered...</i><p>and so it goes...<p>Of course, in practice you can simply say: ""Let's do this for a certain number of acks of acks of acks, 3 let's say, and then just keep sending the same ack to each other, assuming that if the connection was reliable enough to get to three deep, then it will be reliable enough for one of the final acks to make it through.""  That's a false assumption (mathematically - what guarantee do you have that if 3 of your encrypted messages made it across, at least one of the next 217 that you send by sunrise all with the same message will), but a reasonable one.<p>So it is not a practical problem.  This is a mathematical problem.  Although you cannot even do something as simple as ""let's agree to both be in state 1 (or neither if we fail to agree), OK?"" over a less than guaranteed reliable connection, if the connection has any reliability at all you can get to within a practical level.<p>once you reliaze that, PROVABLY, you can't even do the most mundane things no matter what, the mathematics the parent is talking about do not seem all that interesting anymore. :)",1336398884

When you're developing applications be they web applications or some sort of enterprise widget, the majority of the work is connecting libraries together. Most of the difficulty is in dealing with the incongruities of the various APIs. As long as there is a good process in place I've found little trouble in delivering and estimating software.<p>As in the construction of any artifact by human means there will be bumps in the road. No amount of technology we can use today will solve that issue. It's a matter of communication and flexibility. One might speculate that great buildings such as the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building weren't so perfectly specified as to allow the construction workers to simply, ""put the pieces together."" Problems certainly arise and must be dealt with accordingly.<p>Software is no different. We still write programs that guide fighter jets to land on a tiny boat in the middle of the ocean. We've written programs that drive robots across the martian surface. And we also write programs that share our inane thoughts and activities with our friends, family, and random interested strangers. The degrees of failure are still the same and for the most part assessed accordingly: while Twitter will strive for 100% up time there is little money or life lost when it does go down. Whereas when a martian robot plummets into the side of the planet it's a big loss (and has happened). Mistakes are made in engineering. Unanticipated side-effects arise. And we do our best to deal with them as well as we can.<p>What distinguishes software from contemporary engineering? A couple hundred years of development at the very least.

3938893,comment,3937007,3938354,4,0,wtvanhest,,,"There is a massive difference between founding a startup and investing in startups.<p>Professional investors (VCs, Angels, Incubators) choose the best startups (most efficient choices) and do not fund the rest which eliminates a huge number of founders who simply fail and get zero return for their work.  On top of that, there are a number of VCs and angels who are completely unsuccessful picking startups and end up out of the business unable to raise additional institutional money or who lose their additional investment capital.<p>The expected return of investing in startups is very likely negative if you add all the smart and non-smart investors together.  (I don't have data, and can't even imagine where to get it, so I'm saying ""likely"".)<p>Using the security market line to prove your point isnt really fair since not much research has been done on applying it to startups.  One of the major issues with applying the SML is the fact that it is very hard to calculate beta of startup investments since they have very long term time horizons.  SML has more to do with portfolio construction and how you can get a portfolio which doesnt deviate from the benchmark too far while still producing Alpha. (Alpha is active return).  The Tryenor ratio is more about making sure public equity managers are not doing really crazy stuff.<p>Overall my point is that there is no evidence that suggests the expected return from investing is startups in net positive.  Whether founding or working for a startup produces positive expected returns or not is also very hard to know, but I would estimate that working for early stage startups for lower than market pay has a negative expected value even after considering the possibility of huge exits (a lot of companies fail that you have never heard of).<p>Where I think startups have a much higher expected return comes with the experience and growing up you can do while working in a small company. When you calculate total earnings over a lifetime for people who join even failed startups early on, I would not be surprised if they made more and had more enjoyable lives, even if they ended up at big stable companies later.  When you add the possibility of a big exit to the higher future earnings I think the expected value goes net positive.",1336397586

If price is the primary focus, look for second-hand, or used materials.  If that's a bust, know that JC Penney makes the suit most worn by millionaires (according to a book I read that I'm having a hard time remembering -- something something habits of millionaires), and are generally a good bang for the buck.  They aren't high fashion, but they're a suit, which fits the bill.<p>Now, an aside... when I got my first job that needed suits, I did kind of the same thing.  I went out in search of the most cost-efficient suits that didn't look ugly.  I stumbled across a sale at Macy's and ended up buying a couple of suits, and a couple of pant / sportcoat combos for approximately $150-200 a set.<p>Then I started going to meetings, only to realize that while I 'met the grade', I was judged on the quality of my suits by some of the higher ups.  It wasn't like the business card scene in 'American Psycho' or anything, but I'd be asked ""Who are you wearing?"", and other 'rich people questions' I didn't think people ever actually asked.  The worst answer I found was ""I dunno"", but an only slightly better is answering with the name of a poor quality manufacturer.<p>Subsequent advice takes that into consideration, if you'd like to avoid being singled out.  Please note that the advice works well for 'government-quality' attire, and would likely not pass as 'wall-street-quality' attire or ""big-law-quality"" attire.<p>Jos. A. Bank is a respected name in suits, mostly because the average suit cost is about triple ($600-750) the minimum suit cost you can get, <i>but</i> they run sales approximately once a month with buy-one-get-one or buy-one-get-two specials and the like that can knock the effective cost down to $200 or less (which is about the most I'll pay for a suit.)  You can buy the pants unhemmed and take them to a local drycleaner to have them tailored for a nominal fee which helps avoid the 'off-the-rack' fit.<p>If you are like me, I often admire bold color choices on others that I would never pick out for myself, or that I don't think would look good on me.  A good place to go for fashion advice is Men's Wearhouse.  I'm sure mileage varies, but I've been to a few locations in different locales, and I've always gotten great accessory suggestions for ties, shirts, etc., that I would have never picked.  It isn't pushy, and you can 'suggest-down' to whatever level you're comfortable wearing (for when they suggest a hot pink tie or whatever) and a good rep will get your tastes and start suggesting accordingly.<p>You'll pay more generally, but they have pretty aggressive sales on occasion too.",1336397433

Especially she said (and I found that impressive) that children in road traffic aren't safe either, but that does not mean that we should forbid road traffic.

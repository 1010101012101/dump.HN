2052696,comment,2052053,2052053,0,0,EGreg,,,"Now that's what I'm talking about!<p>Patents were originally intended to encourage investors in a time when bringing a product to market could take years.<p>In the software industry, that assumption is, to put it mildly, totally off. Therefore, in the software industry, granting someone a 17 year monopoly on an idea just encourages another, destructive type of strategy that hurts the entire industry: PATENT TROLLING.<p>Seriously, it is a legal strategy to describe something to the government, wait a few years and then go after the people who actually BUILT IT (even if they came up with it independently, as long as they can't prove they came up with it before you described it in a patent application).<p>That's BULL CRAP. You didn't do anything except write some paper. If you're good at it, you don't even need a lawyer. And you get to collect money from the hard work of others.<p>On the other hand, I feel that if you DID write a patent, AND you tried to make it work, AND you are succeeding, you SHOULD be able to prevent your competitors from just copying what you did. But not for 17 years. For two years at most!<p>It is in this latter sense that the patent system is great. I'd get a provisional patent over an NDA anyday. Because it's more legally enforceable. Say a company meets with me and I tell them the idea. First of all I don't have to require them to sign any NDA. Secondly, suppose they say, ""nice idea, we are going to do it ourselves"". I can tell them, ""I have a provisional patent, and I will sue your ass in 2 years."" Or I can tell them NOTHING, go ahead and convert it to a real patent (probably $5k out of my pocket) and go sue them 2 years later. Not 17 years later.<p>This, I don't mind. They wanted to screw me by stealing my idea, they got burned. This will encourage companies to NOT screw individual investors and actually decide if they want to wait 3 years before making this, or work with the inventor.<p>With NDAs, there is no way to prove anything. I spoke to Bobby, and they signed an NDA. Then, Charlie Inc. comes out with my product. I didn't make Charlie, Inc. sign anything, and Bobby doesn't have the $5 million dollars to pay me, and I can't prove he told anything to Charlie, Inc. OOPS.<p>That's what software patents should protect against. That's it. They currently do, but we don't need 17 years of that kind of protection!",1293728171

99.99% of the stuff people are trying to sell on those forums is crap, but there's lots of general information there that's very good. BHW's ""Making Money"" section has a tonne of stickied topics under each subsection with good info.<p>The advantage of having web dev/sysadmin skills is that you can take a method people are running manually (and probably even example code that's floating around) and scale it easily to 100x what they're doing. You don't have to innovate, you just have to automate and scale.<p>Be careful if you use shady methods. If the product owner realises what you're doing, they'll kill your account and refuse to pay the middleman who will refuse to pay you. :)<p>If you meet/befriend other people in IM and establish that you're not a noob, doors will be opened to better offers/products and better terms for payment e.g., being paid three days after the end of the week (""net 3"") instead of seven days (""net 7"").<p>You can get $75 USD free credit when you register on Adwords (<a href=""http://adwords.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adwords.google.com</a>).

Unless your conversion rate is atrocious, you'll make back far more than $75. This isn't a bad place to start experimenting. SEO works, too, but it's more of a ""long haul"" thing.

Fran Allen says in her interview for <i>Coders at Work</i> that IBM's gender balance slowly shifted in the 60s as a side-effect of new IT hiring standards.  Recruiting preference was given to candidates with advanced degrees in engineering, and most of these new graduates were male [1].<p>Through this lens the gender shift can be seen as an artifact of the higher education system:  Fewer women were getting into these schools and finishing with advanced degrees in math and computing.  Even today women can have a tougher road putting together the 7-10 consecutive years of full-time academics required for a terminal degree given that the 20s are also prime child-bearing years.<p>pg explains the corporate hiring mindset better than I can with a ""nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"" analogy in <i>News from the Front</i>:<p><i>A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone buying technology for one. If someone went to Stanford and is not obviously insane, they're probably a safe bet. And a safe bet is enough. No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance of people they turn down</i> [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.codersatwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codersatwork.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html</a>",1293728043

2052681,comment,2052053,2052053,0,0,tgflynn,,,"US patent law (as well as copyright law) derives from Article I section 8 of the Constitution which grants Congress the power ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""<p>The question is do patents actually promote the progress of science and technology ?  I suspect that they do not because while they create additional monetary incentives to pursue innovation at the same time they restrict the free flow of ideas which is the driving force behind scientific and technical progress.<p>The free exchange and use of information is probably the source of the exponential progress in ""information technologies"" that Ray Kurzweil has discovered.  It seems likely that impediments to the exchange and use of information, such as patents, can only reduce the rate of exponential growth.<p>Perhaps if patents had never existed our technology would be far more advanced than it currently is.<p>If it were ever possible to prove conclusively that patents impede rather than promote progress, they would become unconstitutional in the US.",1293728019

The USA is the only democracy that has ever tried to combine these two offices. The fact that no other country has ever imitated this aspect of American government (whereas most other aspects of the American Constitution have been imitated) says a lot about what a bad idea this is. In most democracies, the people are free to show their respect and veneration for the (usually powerless) head of state, and the people feel free to show scathing disrespect to the (powerful) head of government. In the USA, the people often have mixed emotions - when you criticize the head of government, you are also criticizing the head of state, so people typically pull their punches, and use language that is more respectful that what typically gets directed at a head of government in other democracies.",1293726716

In that case, rising prices would induce more people to become doctors, thereby increasing the supply.<p>Unfortunately, there is no free market in medical training - supply is artificially capped. A huge number of qualified people who want to become a doctor are turned away from medical school, and the government artificially restricts the number of medical schools (at the behest of the AMA) [1].<p>[1] Some numbers. I'll assume the average black medical student is qualified (but the 49'th percentile is unqualified), giving me cutoff of MCAT VR 8.3 for a ""qualified doctor"". This cutoff is chosen so I can call people who disagree with me a racist.

2052519,comment,2052096,2052096,0,0,artmageddon,,,"Reposting the article since it seems to be suffering server problems:<p>""Who will you French kiss this New Years?<p>Everyone knows that the week after Christmas (and before the new year) is pretty slow; at Grasshopper alone, I think at least half of our office is on vacation. Certainly a good time for a break, but if you’re like the folks at Moosejaw, it’s also a great time to experiment with some fun (and slightly bizarre) marketing. Case in point is the online retailer’s promotional email sent out today, cleverly titled, “New Year’s Eve Frenching Service.”<p>Frenching service?! Right away I’m interested, since this is not the typical “10% off today only!” email. Why would a retailer who sells The North Face and skiing gear send this out? Curiosity piqued, I open the email and find this:<p>So, what is this? This is a stellar example of the kind of creative marketing that everyone is looking for, and can’t figure out. Even though the email had nothing to do with the products they sell, here’s why it worked:<p>1. Amazing copywriting that grabs you. Groupon’s got over 100 writers. Why? Because they understand that they key to hooking people is with great, lively copy. Moosejaw’s email succeeds because the writing is hilarious, engaging, and completely irreverent. Most brands fail at emails like this because they play it safe with stiff, formal copy. Don’t. If you want to get noticed, include copy that grabs a reader’s attention.<p>2. Timely messaging. This fun “promotion” would only work at New Year’s or Valentine’s Day so the timing was perfect. Even better that this is a historically “slow” week for email, so I might actually read an email from an online retailer versus sending it to the trash.<p>3. Brand personality. Anyone can send an email with a deal, but this email is actually in line with the Moosejaw brand (which, if you know anything about their brand, is a little quirky, definitely different, yet still polished). When you get a box from Moosejaw, it is most likely reused (not recycled), the wrong size, and has lots of stickers on it. These people understand how to make their individuality work for them, and they attract customers who appreciate that level of quirkiness.<p>4. Trust in team members. I doubt this came from some marketing genius at Moosejaw, but instead, a team member that had a fun idea and was allowed to run with it. In a typical company you could never send an email like that to your valuable mailing list, but at Moosejaw, you can do it. Guess what? It works—after all, here I am writing this blog post about Moosejaw.com.<p>This is creative email marketing done right. Nice job, Moosejaw.""<p>IMO they get creativity points, but it only takes one bad advertising campaign to do serious damage to your brand - think of Acclaim Entertainment's ""Name Your Baby Turok"" promotion that was run a long time ago: <a href=""http://www.industrygamers.com/galleries/opinion-video-game-ads-gone-wrong/8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.industrygamers.com/galleries/opinion-video-game-a...</a>",1293725078

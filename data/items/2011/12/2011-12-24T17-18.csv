Macros are easy. If you can understand a program that concatenates lists to make a new list, you can understand a macro. Macros are quite literally 'just lisp code'.<p>Are some macros written in a way that you can not personally understand? Most likely, but that is not an issue inherent to macros. You have to be careful about checking inputs, and creating the proper debugging and type checking at macro-expansion time. Just like any other program. There does seem to be a stupid tendency for people to cram an entire macro into a single function. This is foolish, the whole point is that you have the entire power of this lisp runtime. There is no reason to write it like c pre-processor garbage.<p>So, how does one write good lisp code? Well, one way is to pick some standards. This is as difficult has having someone in charge willing to gently say 'this doesn't really match up with the style of the code around it'. If I've inherited some code, when I do a bug fix, I'm going to do my damnedest to stick with the style that it is written in (unless it is truly tagbody/go awful, in which case I might rewrite).<p>This kind of turned into a rant, I apologize. I guess my point is that sure, lisp is powerful, but the real issue is the number of options that it provides. At some point, you have to pick a subset and a style, and go with it. And then you have to be comfortable learning if you inherit something that you don't know yet.",1324749538
3389293,comment,3389286,3389286,6,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"Thinking Forth is a wonderful book- even if you don't see yourself writing applications in Forth, it contains many insights that can be applied to programming in any language. As it turns out, Forth is a particularly good language for illustrating architectural tradeoffs because you can demonstrate ideas like factoring and API design with extremely short pieces of (idiomatic!) example code.<p>If I had an opportunity to teach an introductory software engineering course, I would strongly consider using Thinking Forth as a textbook.",1324749523

is 20k LOC of C if I remember correctly), and many other achievements. [1]<p>They're able to do this partly due to their language-oriented designs: they
create specialized languages for each system. Note that the compilers for these 
languages are included in the LOC-counts given above. These are not
general-purpose languages, but DSLs, and they are written in a language that is
specialized for writing languages, naturally. [2]<p>[1] See the STEPS progress reports for more details: <a href=""http://vpri.org/html/writings.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vpri.org/html/writings.php</a>

If the issue is cost of imprisonment per inmate per year, then the correct comparison is to the spending per full-time student per year, which at Princeton and several other universities is higher than the billed full list price tuition, because Princeton has other sources of revenue besides tuition.<p>Spending per full-time student figures are collected by the United States federal government, by law, and are reported on the College Results website maintained by a nonprofit organization.<p><a href=""http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=186131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=18...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: While doing other things away from my computer, I thought about how the submitted article relates to the culture aspired to here on Hacker News. In February 2009, Paul Graham wrote an article ""What I've Learned from Hacker News""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html</a><p>looking back on the first two years of Hacker News. He wrote then, ""There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs to avoid: bad stories and bad comments."" He thought at that time that the steps Hacker News takes to keep out bad stories have been largely successful, and to this date there haven't been any big technical changes (certainly never downvotes on submissions) to screen out bad stories. The author of the submitted article says, ""Think before you link"" in her example of an infographic about the problem described in the article, and goes on to say, ""So before you pick up that infographic, give it a good, hard look."" This is the desired culture here on HN. Early in my 1132 days of participation here on HN, I asked more experienced participants if the expectation here is that links are submitted for comment, even if the submitter disagrees with the link, or if submitting a link is an implicit endorsement that the link has at least minimal quality. The participants who kindly replied to my question overwhelmingly said that I and participants here in general should just submit links that they endorse as worth a read, not crap links to stir up comments of disagreement. I agree with the author of the submitted link here that infographics are too eye-catching and resist efforts at fact-checking, and that is is worthwhile to check the underlying sources and facts before passing on a link to an infographic. Way back in 1954 the author of How to Lie with Statistics<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/039...</a><p>pointed out that some lies about statistics are most easily performed with display graphics.

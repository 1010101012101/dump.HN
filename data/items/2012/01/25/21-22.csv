I hope I don't come across as defensive or argumentative. My specialty is writing code, not communicating with the public :-)<p>We all live in bubbles of various sorts. Working at Google is clearly a bubble of a sort. A lot of more information gets shared internally than gets released publicly. As a mild digression - sometimes it gets hard to keep track of what information is private and what has been shared publicly. I think most of us err on the side of caution and default to talking less than more.<p><i>""figure out how to communicate with people outside of Google who have a billion other things to worry about in the ordinary course of their lives that are far more important to them than Google""</i><p>This is where I'm sure there is a lot of ground for debate on how an announcement like this should have been made.<p>On one hand, I could argue that - given that there <i>are</i> a lot of people that could care less about Google, or about this announcement - posting it on Google+ was <i>exactly</i> the right thing to do, since the announcement was about Google+.<p>After all - HN is itself a big bubble and there are plenty of topics that people within the HN bubble care passionately about but that people outside of this particular bubble care much less about <shrug>. The G+ names policy is (IMO) one of those issues. It's a topic that people seem to either be <i>really</i> passionate about, or completely indifferent. I'd say the portion that care passionately is over-represented in the HN community (for the record - there are probably even a higher percentage that are passionate about it within the company. This was, and is, a hotly debated topic internally).<p>I'm not necessarily saying you're wrong about whether making this particular announcement on G+ was the best move - just that I think it was a reasonable one.<p>""<i>Google's leadership may have had such a vision, and may have communicated it with some clarity internally""</i><p>It wasn't really messaged much differently or with much more clarity within the company, as far as I can tell.<p>My perspective comes more from having a front-row seat for watching the sausage being made :-) (obviously this is something that is hard to scale)<p>There is - unfortunately - very little hard science or hard data available for how to put together a product like G+. A lot of it comes down to having a vision, making some assumptions and trying to build a product around those. And then paying attention to what happens.<p>There have been plenty of decisions about the design and policies surrounding G+ that I haven't agreed with over time. What I have respected, though, is the fact that the team and the leadership <i>have</i> listened and have paid attention and have made course corrections as things have developed. \nThere have been more of those that we got to witness while the product was still in internal-only beta. This is kind-of the first significant course correction that is publicly visible. I'm sure it won't be the last.<p>I've also observed during the making of G+ that it can be easy to posit ulterior motives to people when they are making decisions that just seem so <i>wrong</i> to you. I've been guilty of this myself :-)  Over time, Vic/Brad/Yonatan/et al. have won my trust that there aren't ulterior motives behind the decisions, just strongly held opinions/assumptions/visions that are different than my own.<p>I don't know how to share that with the world, other than to show up here and talk to people when I have something to say :-)",1327528780

3511912,comment,3509710,3509809,1,0,greeneggs,,,"The Technology Review article is confusing, but I can try to summarize.<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises security based on the laws of quantum physics, and not on computational assumptions.  However, in practice, QKD experiments have been attacked through side channels.  One possible side channel comes from a malicious manufacturer.  Side-channel attacks also affect classical cryptography, of course, but might be more important for QKD because:<p>1. Quantum devices are harder to build and test, and less understood, than classical devices, so side-channel attacks might be easier, at least for now.<p>2. The goal of QKD has always been to reach higher security than is possible classically.<p>""Device-independent"" (DI) QKD <i>solves</i> this problem.  DIQKD allows for extracting a secure key even if the crypto devices are manufactured by your enemy.  This should be hard to believe; it is completely impossible classically.  It is very cool that it is (probably) possible quantumly.<p>I say ""probably"" because full DIQKD security proofs do not yet exist; giving a full proof is a major open problem in the field.  From the perspective of people in the field, the next step in the DIQKD roadmap would be to deploy a DIQKD experiment.  Although standard QKD schemes are even commercially available these days, deploying a DIQKD scheme is another major open problem because the schemes proposed currently are far too inefficient to be practical and require noise rates below current photon detector technology.<p>The new paper says that we should reconsider this roadmap.  Even if we are able to give a DIQKD security proof, there is still a problem, because when you reuse untrusted devices they can leak previously generated keys.  I don't have a lot of time to explain this and don't know that it is an especially novel observation.  It can probably be worked around with more sophisticated key-generation methods.  But that's essentially the current status.",1327528346

When you're dependent on a group, you're accountable to that group, and often held to a higher standard than you might hold yourself as an individual.<p>Wanting a bureaucrat to evaluate and judge welfare recipients worthy or unworthy is probably just that same desire for accountability - if you're drawing down the resources of a broader, nationwide group, you should somehow be held accountable to that group.<p>This isn't a bad instinct to have, but it's impossible to implement at the inhuman scale of federal and state governments - the welfare recipient doesn't feel particularly accountable to the abstract community of 'America as a whole', and 'America as a whole' has no shared standard to hold the individual to.

While we as bystanders can parse and decide whether what Google is doing is evil, this has no bearing on what Google itself considers evil. If evilness is not readily discernable, then there will be deviations between the two. But this doesn't mean that Google itself is putting itself in a position to do evil. Why do you think Google considers its actions evil?

They see the bottom anywhere down to 20% more. If I personally where in your position, I would cut my losses now, given that you do not know what tomorrow will bring. Even if tomorrow brings a job, you are in a better financial position by walking. Especially if you have enough in savings to pick up another house once the market bottoms. To me you are in an ethically good situation to do it, and it makes the most financial sense. If it where me personally I would not seek to do a short sale as you have already chased it down to where you are at retirement funds, destroying yourself to honor an obligation should not be expected, which is a possibility because you will be responsible for payments while it is in short sale and demand is too far down to take the bet that it will sell soon. As well not that this should affect your decision, but foreclosures have taken several years to go through, with the mortgage fraud in some states they are virtually stopped and do not look to be starting up anytime soon. If you do choose to default, you will be in the home for a long time, you can utilize this time to rebuild your life.

If we don't obsess on finding the perfect algorithms, but allow ourselves a floor of say O( n^2 ), I think our productivity could go up substantially.<p>Maybe it's time for a bunch of geeks like us to be willing to unlearn what we have learned, basically scrap everything, and try working backwards from what the solution will look like (what people will be using in a few decades).",1327527467

In order to 'prevent piracy', technical solutions are worthless compared to providing a quality service where your  customers' willingness to buy is on par with your price. As noted by the author, DRM decreases the quality of a service, and often carries an increased price [at least for company in production/support/etc].<p>For some industries, the price does not align with expectations. I can think of retail Blu-ray for instance [the price is too high].<p>For others, the DRM encourages piracy to some degree. Often with Windows this is the case.

This ability to known boundaries, respect them, and push them occasionally is a key skill of a good executive. This same ability is hard for an inexperienced person to even fathom. For instance, a good executive knows when to make the politically correct move even though its more painful operationally but an inexperienced person may not even realize they are making a political move.<p>Consider a startup developer vs. a enterprise developer. A startup developer essentially starts from scratch and builds what they want. An enterprise developer must know the existing environment, know the entrenched technologies, know the involved parties, get the process owners to agree on decisions, and then make informed decisions on how to build out their requirements based on all these factors.<p>In startup circumstances naivety can be an asset, in the enterprise world naivety isn't even an acceptable excuse.<p>note: I am not trying to trivialize starting from scratch. Building a startup from scratch is a highly commendable skill set in and of itself, its just not relevant to the argument framed by the OP.",1327526215

In a high-functioning organization, creativity and entrepreneurship comes from the organization as a whole - it's the job of every employee.<p>Mostly, these positions are about people management - building a team of great people and getting the best out of the team as a whole. This is really hard, and it takes a lot of practice. I've certainly cocked it up more than once.<p>Since people management is something that you learn by doing, it makes sense to hire someone who's both done the job of the type of employee they'll be managing and has a track record of managing the type of employee they'll be managing.  Bringing in someone inexperienced is too much of a risk - if you fail, it's not just you that performs poorly, it's your entire team.<p>You simply can't relate this situation to a VC's (or more likely, an angel's) willingness to put a small amount of money on an inexperienced founder - the two situations are very different. A VC is in the business of risk - he has a large portfolio and expects most of his investments to fail. A CEO is in charge of one and only one company, and the VPs he hires are all in charge of critical functions. Often, he can't afford to have <i>any</i> of them fail.",1327526186

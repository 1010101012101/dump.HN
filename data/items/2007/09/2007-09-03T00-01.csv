The stories they break are consistently days behind Digg/Reddit, and of no better quality.",1188781162

Wal-mart used to be an excellent company too, when Walton was around (or so I've read), and now they appear merely efficient.",1188780720

They had a wonderful product with the Mac, a lackluster followup, a huge explosion of new models around 1993 (most of which weren't all that good), and then they nearly went out of business around 1997.  I was a die-hard Mac user for most of my childhood, but gave up on them in 1998 when they took the Microsoft investment and copied all the worst features of Windows.<p>They only got better when Steve Jobs returned and axed most of their product lines.  (Okay, Gil Amelio was really responsible for most of the axing and some of the new development, but Jobs has an eye for design.)  Apple now is lean and simple.  Apple ten years ago had a byzantine product line of mediocre machines and buggy software.",1188780203

I'd like to define what exactly that force is and define how to prevent it.",1188777652

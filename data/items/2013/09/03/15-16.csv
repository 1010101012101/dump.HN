Are Ikea desks that can be made at 1/5th the cost but last 1/10th as long representative of the forefront of technology? I&#x27;d argue when it comes to furniture manufacturing, the Amish actually are at the forefront of technology. The Amish are Apple and Ikea is Sony.<p>> at least extremely sub-optimal.<p>This doesn&#x27;t matter. Laboring under the assumption that tools X, Y, and Z are indispensable makes your average shop much less likely to discover tool Q that does all three jobs at once for a quarter of the effort and practically for free. The best technology often looks like nothing at all because you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there.<p>> Pneumatic power tools are nothing new<p>Neither are computers. Your entire arguments are based on the unstated assumption that electricity and computers are required to make anything that is on the forefront of technology - this is not true. Electricity and computers are all well and good. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with specialization.<p>If you look at things from the &quot;good of scientific progress&quot; perspective, it&#x27;s a great thing that we have people like the Amish who arbitrarily cut off ties to certain technologies but not others.

Don&#x27;t consider this nitpicking; just some questions that came to mind, since your experience is so different from mine using win8 on a tablet.<p>Word doesn&#x27;t have autosave anymore? It&#x27;s had it since like Office 95!<p>Did the machine really power itself off, losing your work, every week even if you had it in hibernate or sleep mode?

For me, I consider the Windows 8 behavior the only optimal choice: Windows software in general is designed on the assumption that screen geometry will not change constantly every time you tap. The android/iOS behavior of keyboards popping up at random as the focus moves around can be a real pain when trying to precision target objects, scroll around, or highlight content. There are certainly cases where it&#x27;s unambiguous and the keyboard could just be popped up, but at most I found that a minor nitpick when interacting with W8 on a daily basis - and you&#x27;ve got a Surface, where you can just attach a keyboard and start typing.

That means they add technologies to your systems not because they&#x27;re needed, but because the engineers want to play with them. Rather than consider the implications of making the systems more complex and more costly to manage, they are easily lured by shiny new technology and come up with justifications to use it even if it provides <i>negative</i> business value.<p>These engineers aren&#x27;t bad people. They will legitimately think that the new technology is a good idea. They may even make an impassioned business case for it. But listening to these engineers is the equivalent of a naive young girl believing a teenage boy &quot;really loves her&quot; at the end of a first date when he wants to go to Make-Out Point &quot;just to talk&quot;. The boy may actually believe this in his heart, but any woman with more experience will see exactly what&#x27;s really going on.<p>To see companies that suffer from this, it&#x27;s as simple as looking at a few job postings for developers. Look for the postings that list requirements for waaaay more technologies than the company could possibly need. It&#x27;s a sign that novelty has cursed that company.<p>For more on this, see my post: <a href=""http://devopsu.com/blog/boring-systems-build-badass-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devopsu.com/blog/boring-systems-build-badass-business...</a><p>If someone offers to make your systems &quot;exciting and cool!&quot;, be very afraid. Your systems are the foundation of your business and they should be simple, secure, scalable, and generally pretty boring.<p>## Mistake: Neglect<p>The other problem I see frequently are systems that are simply neglected.<p>No one knows if the database backups work. No one knows if there are critical security updates that need to be applied. No one knows if the site is down until a customer complains. No one knows if the guy who quit a year ago still has a copy of the production database. On and on...<p>You will often see neglect in systems that became complex due to novelty. Every new technology that is added to a system requires monitoring, documentation, and security updates. The more technologies that get added to a system means the more technologies that are at risk of becoming orphans and neglected.<p>## Shameless Plug<p>Manage servers? One of the biggest wins against neglect is to use a configuration management tool like Ansible, Salt, Chef, or Puppet.<p>If you want to make sure your systems are fast, scalable, and secure, the first step is having full control and power over them.<p>Tomorrow, Sept 4th, I&#x27;m launching my book &quot;Taste Test: Puppet, Chef, Salt, Ansible&quot; which is designed to save you the days or weeks of research when picking one of these tools.<p>In the book, I implement an identical project with each tool so you can see what each one is like to work with.

Not sure why the down vote, so I&#x27;ll add to your thought stream<p>I dislike Flat design because it removes visual affordances that help novice users navigate a new interface. I loathe Google Maps on iOS because it is unclear to me that certain icons act as both buttons and draggable inputs. I&#x27;ve been casually using the app since its release, and I continue to be frustrated by it today.<p>While the original iOS design provided visual embellishments that served two purposes. First, textures provide familiar context giving new users a sense of immediate understanding. Second, basic features were obvious to intuit. It was clear what was a button and what was interface chrome. The same cannot be said with iOS7. Yes, it&#x27;s easy to learn that colorized text is a button. But, it must be learned, and is easy to miss when quickly scanning the interface.<p>For these reasons I believe the parent&#x27;s points are valid.

6321639,comment,6320320,6320320,1,0,a-priori,,,"I completely agree that pragmatism is essential to being a great developer. When designing a system, you should be asking yourself questions like:<p>1) What sort of load will this system need to handle now and in the foreseeable future, and what sort of latency can it tolerate? How will that load flow through the system? In this contrived scenario, the server and database need to be able to handle an average throughput ~9 requests a minute with lax latency requirements (it&#x27;s okay if things are backed up by a couple minutes). The devices only need to handle one operation per hour. Planning a safety margin of perhaps 10-100% above that is prudent; more than that is premature.<p>2) What are the upgrade characteristics of each component: how will you upgrade or replace each component? how long would it take? can you even upgrade them? Some parts will be in a central location, and can be easily upgraded with only minor downtime. Some will be deployed on hardware you don&#x27;t control or otherwise can&#x27;t be easily upgraded. In the worst case, they&#x27;re embedded in firmware and you need to support them as-is for their entire lifespan.<p>3) What are the failure modes of each component: what could cause them to fail? how likely is that? what will happen if (when) they do? how will you recover?<p>The answers to those questions determine how much risk you can take when designing each component.<p>Also, look at where the answers are different for two components that talk to each other. Any time there&#x27;s a boundary between two components that can&#x27;t be upgraded at the same time, or where one component talks to another with different failure modes, there&#x27;s an interface. You need to think hard about the interface between them: how will they communicate? how will you extend that communication protocol over time while maintaining backwards compatibility? how will they behave if the other has failed? Those interfaces are locations where over-engineering a bit can pay off.<p>So for this example, I would think hard about what runs on the devices and how they talk to the back end, because that code is probably very difficult to upgrade. I would use rock-solid, dependable technologies for those. Similarly, the database probably stores important information, and one of its failure modes is that all the data is lost due to hardware failure. So I would use a mature database there, either MySQL or PostgreSQL.<p>But the back-end service? It&#x27;s easy to upgrade and because it&#x27;s stateless, its two failure modes are that it crashes and it needs to be restarted, or that the hardware fails and it needs to be re-deployed. Neither failure mode is that bothersome, so it doesn&#x27;t matter what technology you use there. Use whatever the team is most familiar with and will let you iterate the fastest.",1378223593

I love that Blackberries are using QNX but this is not enough.<p>My other concern is if Microsoft is being negligent instead of if they are right or wrong. For example, I think Skype acquisition was negligent in a moment where this kind of technology was moving to the browser (WebRTC), being commoditized, and with a few lines of code everyone can technically replicate the technical parts of the service. Nokia acquisition and Microsoft recent write-offs will scare investors.<p>In others aspects I also experienced a general degradation in the Microsoft relationship with partners/developers that can obviously harm their business and developers ecosystem. For example, they didn&#x27;t release the latest Windows 8.1 version to MSDN customers, only to a few vendors. Companies need the latest release to test their software in new environments.<p>There are a lot of positive things that Microsoft is doing right related to the cloud such as Hyper-V, App-V, Azure, and development tools.

There are alternative (and better) ways to navigate a file system that don&#x27;t require pop-ups and other types of additional windows.<p>With Emacs directory navigation you can navigate into archive files such as .tar, .tgz and .zip without having to extract them.<p>Another Emacs benefit that Sublime may or may not support is that the editor&#x27;s code can be customized simply by placing cursor at the function and typing a keystroke. Your code is then immediately active with no restarts or reloading.<p>Emacs works just as well in a OS window on my laptop and remotely running in a terminal. Being able to use the same editor locally and on a headless server is huge if you do server work at all.<p>You can run bash (or whatever) shells in emacs buffers.

It&#x27;s not a valid assumption.  I think it&#x27;s actually immoral to believe that because something is lawful it must be good.  In other words, if somebody actually does have &quot;legal justification&quot; to kill someone else (no greater authority will stop them), that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it a good thing, e.g. in the case of capital punishment in the US, or in the case of using chemical weapons in Syria absent some kind of foreign intervention, or in the case of the US bombing Syria.<p>Morals are relative, and not everyone will agree with a law.  Illegal things can be moral, immoral things can be legal.  In the best case everyone&#x27;s morals contribute to the law, in the worst case it&#x27;s only the lawmaker&#x27;s morals that truly matter.  None of that changes the fact that for something to be a law there has to be a punishment for breaking the law, and that punishment for doing something makes it into a de facto law.  It&#x27;s unpalatable but there it is.<p>I&#x27;m a pacifist too, for what it&#x27;s worth; I believe violence is only a good idea when it prevents even greater violence, I believe it&#x27;s a good thing for power to be concentrated by governments, and I don&#x27;t like the current state of international relations where rich countries tell poor countries what to do.

6321532,comment,6320320,6320320,3,0,EnderMB,,,"There seems to be a self-imagined divide between these two &quot;camps&quot; of developer. We see:<p>1. Hipsters that throw tools at a problem, and are eager to know as many different languages/frameworks/tools as possible, to stay ahead of the curve.<p>2. Developers that have picked a framework, and stick with it for life. They learn when necessary, but their framework can handle most problems thrown at it.<p>I would consider myself a part of both camps. I read Hacker News because people talk about these tools in use, and I love sitting down at home and toying around with new JavaScript frameworks, and different environments/tools. However, I have a job where I use a proven framework, a solid language, and a role where I model problems with a team of like-minded developers.<p>Now, imagine the scenario. I toy around with a new framework and absolutely love it for some use case. I decide to write a tool using Node.js, I use Bootstrap, and then I post it on my blog, Twitter, and on Hacker News. Some will check my work out and think it&#x27;s cool, and others will look at it and will vomit at the very thought of JavaScript running on a server when another server-side language/framework would be far more suited to the problem at hand.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that developers are so keen to slate projects/code that was written for fun. My Node.js application isn&#x27;t very good. Hell, I can probably write it a million times better in the language I actually use day-to-day in my job. I just wanted to release it so others can learn from it, and to show that I&#x27;m capable of keeping up with everyone else that is releasing apps-a-plenty in all these crazy new languages I see every day.<p>I agree with the general idea of the article, but only because developers are starting to embody these camps. I see entry-level/junior developers that apply for jobs with CV&#x27;s that list every language they&#x27;ve touched for at least half an hour, and I see battle-hardened developers complaining about people trying to legitimise new tools because they&#x27;re &quot;not as good&quot; as the tools that everyone else uses.",1378222601

While I&#x27;m skeptical that such a strategy could have seriously damaged 2001-era AQ&#x27;s ability to operate inside Afghanistan, I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m qualified to debate its merits today. But that&#x27;s not my point.<p>My point is that if another 9/11-scale attack occurred <i>and</i> the bad guys were in Yemen <i>and</i> the Yemeni government was not extremely helpful in bringing those responsible to heel, that &quot;drones and spies&quot; strategy could never be the limit of our response. It&#x27;s just not politically practical, not even close. When Schneier talks about the &quot;waste&quot; of a war in Afghanistan, he should remember that the entire time Bush was sticking around trying to nation build, the Democrats were making political hay that Iraq was a sideshow and that we weren&#x27;t spending <i>enough</i> attention/money/troops on Afghanistan. And indeed when a Democratic president was elected, he proceeded to spend more attention/money/troops on Afghanistan.<p>Once it was established that AQ was responsible for 9/11 and that the Taliban were not going to give them up on our terms, a major military incursion was <i>politically</i> inevitable. It&#x27;s a little more dicey just how inevitable a long-term occupation was: President Gore presumably doesn&#x27;t have to deal with an Afghani-Hawks-By-Convenience wing of his own party, and maybe gets out quick. But Schneier doesn&#x27;t make this distinction: He seems to be imagining a world in which the war never happens at all because we properly measured its risks. I happen to think he&#x27;s wrong about the risk/reward tradeoff of aggressively rolling up AQ and their support networks, but I&#x27;m <i>sure</i> he&#x27;s being Utopian if he thinks he&#x27;s in anything but a tiny minority who would be against a massive military response to another 9/11-like event.",1378221463

The baseline of supporting JS off is that you have the render the entire page contents server-side.  If the progressive enhancement is addition of content that is only supported by JS then you are correct.  However the ideal progressive rendering is to send a generic static HTML shell with no personalized content that can be delivered instantaneously from a web server without any back-end chatter, then load in the dynamic content from the client side.  Facebook is probably the most advanced implementation of this technique, and it yields a dramatic increase in perceived performance due to the fact that page starts visually appearing faster which psychologically extends the user&#x27;s patience.",1378221447

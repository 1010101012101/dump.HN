6950772,comment,6950492,6950714,3,0,clavalle,,,"Well, the &#x27;myth&#x27; has merit.  Let&#x27;s apply common sense.<p>You buy a smallish house in a suburb and pay $1000/month for you mortgage.  $900 of that goes directly to equity.<p>At the end of the year, if you home retains its value, you have over $10,000 in equity.<p>If you pay the same amount for rent, you have nothing to show for it.  And oftentimes rent for an equivalent house is actually more than the mortgage + tax payments.<p>So, which is better $10,000 or $0?<p>The volatility of the last few years has complicated this a bit (people going underwater, for example), and I don&#x27;t think people should see a home as a vehicle for getting rich, but it is generally a nice value store.<p>Plus, there are HUGE advantages for people invested in the area to own their property.  It is more stable for them (they can&#x27;t be kicked out), they are more likely to invest in the value of their area (volunteerism, making sure local politicians take care of the parks, reporting crime, that kind of thing).<p>Edit:  Let me point out that yes, these numbers are made up and don&#x27;t accurately reflect reality.  I did not use a mortgage calculator or anything (I thought that would be obvious) but the underlying idea that I was trying to convey holds....if you are spending x dollars and are able to store any portion of that in something that holds some value it is better than spending x dollars and not storing any of that value.  So, even if only $10 of every $1000 spent on the mortgage goes into equity, it is better than $0 if you rent.",1387731382

But let me offer another point of view.<p>To my mind, the point isn&#x27;t whether or not the job is algorithm-heavy.  If you don&#x27;t have this stuff under your belt, there are limits to what you can do.  If you have to concentrate on working out which algorithm to use, or which data structure to use, if you have to spend time researching these things, that doesn&#x27;t make you a poor programmer, but it stops you from spending time on the real problem solving aspects of the job.<p>The programmers I hire don&#x27;t often have to do major algorithm stuff, and some of them are not comfortable with algorithms and data structures, but that&#x27;s OK.  They have other strengths.<p>But even if the job doesn&#x27;t require deep knowledge of algorithms and data structures, knowing them helps more often than you think.  One needs to know these things to recognize them when they turn up unexpectedly and in disguise.  Well, in my experience anyway.  Your mileage may|will vary.<p>But when I hire, I interview for, and care most about people&#x27;s abilities to get things done, to work constructively with others, and to extend their knowledge, skills, and abilities.  To walk away when someone asks about something you don&#x27;t (yet) know, says that we wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit anyway, and not because you don&#x27;t know about algorithms.<p><i>Edited to remove some unintentional snark.</i><p><i>Additional edit: I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;ve been down-voted.

If a client updates a resource via a PATCH method and other services are notified of the update via a web hook or a message bus (possibly including the PATCH or the full resource), the system is still following a RESTful design.<p><i>2) Orchestration / Experience APIs</i><p>A RESTful API does not need to require a separate GET for every individual resource. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with implementing bulk queries that return variable projections of the server state tuned to the need of particular use cases.<p>Bulk modifications are trickier, especially when atomicity comes into play.

People are critical, but criticism is necessary for debate, improvement, and freethought. Everybody should be free to express their thoughts, as long as they&#x27;re well meant and not obvious, unreasonable attacks. When we start considering censoring people who disagree with us, we&#x27;re only inflicting cognitive biases upon ourselves. We resort to groupthink, people thinking one thing but expressing another in order to prevent discord.<p>And I don&#x27;t see how this environment is unfriendly to creators. If anything, people giving honest opinions about something without fear of reprisal from their peers gives the creator the tools to reflect upon their own judgements. Without it, they could be digging themselves into deeper holes with confirmation bias. If anything, it presents a creator with a good opportunity to retort misconceptions about their creation by replying to those critical comments.<p>There are of course, creators who use HN for marketing their products, and marketing is often dishonest or not completely honest. It should be expected that when pitching a product to a technically competent crowd, you should cut the bullshit and let the product speak for itself. It&#x27;s my hope that marketers should only be welcome here if they&#x27;re honest, and having freedom of expression in comments gives us the opportunity to make judgements without investigating everything ourselves.

Monkey style, the first adopter&#x27;s success is giving clue for those afraid of trying new things.

And according to the theory of &quot;The rich get richer&quot;, this will not change, unless someone clever enough, uses system theory to subvert and defeat the corporate culture, or the whole society backs this idea, ie. to stop the inevitable destruction of the remaining planetary resources.

There is no problem with their current approach if they don&#x27;t feel social responsibility, but if they do (and they claim to), then the current approach does seem a violation of that. I don&#x27;t have all the answers as to how they should approach this, but it&#x27;s not difficult to see that something is broken in how they are evaluating new products & services. It&#x27;s not just that they end up abandoning a lot of them; it&#x27;s what they do inbetween, as well. They seem to lack commitment to them.<p>Examples:<p>Could they really not have transformed Google Reader into something valuable?<p>Did they really promote Google Wallet for Digital Goods sufficiently to expect any sort of success from it? (I used it and the UX and fees were the best around; promotion was non-existent)<p>Did Google Helpouts get enough of a push, either?<p>This new thing is great if Google are going to get behind it and stick with it until it&#x27;s successful.

These ideas and practices may sound common sense now, but were not until popularized -- I suspect -- by Pragmatic Programmer. If you found good practices already entrenched in the ecosystem when you joined the industry, the roots can be traced back to a few good books such as Pragmatic Programmer. Even though these ideas may not have been ground breaking, nobody now needs to spend time convincing their peers about these practices from first principles. Time and energy saved for everyone.<p>My point is, I have seen enough [senior] programmers to whom clean code etc. does not come naturally, and they always benefit from reading this book.

And what coding style to use is convention, and how to integrate with other programmers, how to manage projects, &quot;Best Practices&quot; and Patterns, all are conventions, and the degree to which they make the difference is a function of the quality of the involved programmers abilities, not a function of the style chosen. Hence my characterization of all the above as &quot;Elaborations and Decorations&quot;. Most of the earlier hardware list also fit into that characterization, but the idiosyncrasies of each ISA and core architecture can have enormous impact on the final products&#x27; performance and need proper attention.<p>It is sad that after 50 years in the business I still know how these things work, and how to make them sing. It should not be so. But the technology has only gotten smaller and faster and has more immediate storage available and faster I/O and more elaborations and accelerations. No fundamental changes. Not that it doesn&#x27;t blow my mind every so often, that what was a mere pipe-dream in the 60&#x27;s is today mundane, or even so ubiquitous its underpinning have faded into the background. But it was pretty much already all down on paper in the 60&#x27;s, just waiting on the capacity of technology SOA to catch up.<p>The list presented contained very little if any fundamentals. And without the fundamentals, the knowledge garnered is rote, founded upon shifting sands. Thus, I posit the books from which one learned those fundamentals should occupy top place in any such list. The knowledge garnered shapes every future thought on the subject, shapes every problem solving approach, shapes how you think about computers and computing at an internalized level.<p>In 50 years of commercial (if not commerce per se) experience (and continuing), every hire I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to work with has them, and every hire that frustrated and produced bad, unreadable, buggy, and inefficient code, did not.<p>That we have today billions of transistors in the space once occupied by one, and clock cycles thousands of times higher, and communication rates trillions of times higher (potentially anyway), is no excuse for not understanding how it all fits together. Today we need to do more with what we have, and so resources are always limited. Possibly a derivative of Parkinson&#x27;s Law at work. Instead all too often I see bloat and the hope that tomorrows&#x27; machines will fix things. Tomorrow never comes, it seems.<p>As IIRC Piccasso (Dali?) is reputed to have told one young hopeful: &quot;Come back to me when you can show me you can draw a straight line.

9155952,comment,9153240,9153240,0,0,mikro2nd,,,"Aside from the obvious benefits of this perspective to bring clarity in deciding what you work on each day, each week, each hour, it also brings to me a strong sense of respect for other peoples&#x27; time.<p>I strive, for this very reason, to always be on time for meetings. If I say I&#x27;ll see you at the coffee shop at 10:30, I&#x27;ll be there at or before 10:30, barring any unanticipatable derailments. It doesn&#x27;t pay to get obsessive about it, but such time consciousness fosters a respect for the other person&#x27;s death. A good way to piss me off is to be persistently careless with meeting times; you&#x27;re showing a marked disrespect for my time/death. And your own.<p>Being aware of death also helps me maintain quality, precision and focus when dealing with groups of people: I was always very aware of &quot;other peoples&#x27; time&quot; when addressing groups (sometimes large groups) of people in the forms of teaching and speaking at conferences. The awareness that, for each second of <i>my</i> time &quot;spent&quot;, I am being granted the amazing gift of tens, hundreds or even thousands of seconds of everybody else&#x27;s time. To me a humbling thought that always helped me get my own damn ego out of the way and focus on adding quality/value to the content of whatever I was trying to deliver.",1425625458

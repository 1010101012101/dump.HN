376112,story,,,4,6,crux,"Ask HN: What do the enlightened use when the rest of us use Excel?",,"So, I've come into a large amount of statistical data. It's all quite simple and uniform: just a sequence of scores for three actors, which form a series of games. Every so often there's one of a couple discrete events that can be overlaid on top of a score.<p>So I want to parse it; just do a bunch of your standard avgs and sums. I've never used Excel in such depth before but as of right now it seems awfully ill-suited for the job. Simple (cognitively) operations like 'if this is the highest value in the column', or 'return the number of times the following string appears in the search region' (already I have to kludge in faked strings, because there's no way that I can see to tag a cell with metadata to represent an event) are either totally missing, or implemented in such a roundabout manner that they're very brittle.<p>So what do you, hacker news, use when you need to slice and dice your numbers? Short of starting from scratch in Python or Perl, what (hacker-friendly) environments are there that will allow greater flexibility and modularity when it comes to spreadsheet applications?",1227595887

Instead, the language is intended to run a virtual machine that in turn performs the execution at the lowest level.</i><p>Virtual machines virtualize the <i>processor</i>, not the operating system.<p>Leaving aside the nitpicking, the basic argument appears to be that imperative languages will be replaced with ""standardized abstract declarative descriptions"".

I read through the whole thing, and it struck me instantly as a classic which every hacker here should read. It is surely one of the best things Backus ever wrote.<p>Interspersed among long-obsolete technical details are gems of insight about software and programming languages that are worth their weight in gold. The final paragraphs articulate Backus' critique of ""Von Neumann languages"" in a way that even his (much better known) masterpiece on FP doesn't achieve.<p>I had no idea that, prior to Fortran I, the very possibility of a workable compiler had already been widely rejected as impossible because of grandiose claims made by vendors. In other words, vaporware is older than high-level languages.<p>And behind the dry academic tone one gets a feel for the the brilliant design work, all-night debugging sessions and camaraderie of one of the greatest teams of all time - as well as, to judge by his consistently humble self-effacement, one of the greatest team leaders.<p>So to the chorus of chicken littles incessantly bemoaning the decline of Hacker News, now's your chance to redeem yourself: shut up and read this paper!",1227593427

One question though: don't you think your highlight about last.fm and approach to HN is a little too homogenous?<p>While I can appreciate music suggestions that are in line with my taste, that is easy enough to find on my own (through the methods you suggested).  What isn't easy to find are bands that sound nothing like what I've heard, but could be just as brilliant as the bands I know and love.  This is where I think the suggestions in this thread are most useful.<p>And I would go even further to argue that because music is subjective and immeasurable it would make an even more interesting discussion.<p>Thanks too for North of America - I haven't heard them but will definitely check them out.",1227593303

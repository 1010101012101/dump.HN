1267574,comment,1267105,1267506,0,0,chegra84,,,"""successful innovators"" lol.
I have this idea that it takes more than one person to be successful. I think you rarely find the guy with the revolutionary idea and the guy that is the determine hard worker to be the same person.
The ideas person is normally a dreamer and likes to change ideas quickly while the determine hard worker is diligent and hates change.<p>According to Meredith Belbin - ""NOBODY'S PERFECT - BUT A TEAM CAN BE""

You are right, but this is not because of marketing grounds, this is because I would personally never use a software as as a service for my code/projects where I cannot move out of it without losing my data <i>and</i> workflow.<p>This is another subject, but for a critical part of my business, I want to always have full control over my data and workflow.

1267567,comment,1267328,1267547,0,0,sounddust,,,"That's an interesting point of view: Should people be encouraged to choose between religion or reason, or should we encourage religion to adapt?  I don't think the answer is clear; I'd guess that the most effective approach is a case-by-case basis (true, the Roman Catholic church is unlikely to bend anytime soon, but perhaps other religions are more willing to adapt). Others have the right to criticize religion just as much as they have the right to their beliefs, so I think that the focus should be on effectiveness rather than ""rights"" (which I think are well-preserved in both cases).<p>One thing I want to point out: mother-to-infant transmission of HIV is around 2-8% with proper preventative treatment and 15-30% without, so I disagree that the child will ""probably"" carry HIV, although it is certainly a risk.",1271332266

Let me begin by saying I'm agnostic so I'm not actually church-biased.<p>The roman catholic church has rules and nobody is forced to follow those rules. If some people like to think they are roman catholics then they should follow those rules which include not having sex unless you are procreating.<p>Now you can say the church should evolve, become modern, and while that would be fair, it's also fair for the church to stand by their ideals.<p>You can insist and say they have a fair share of responsability for those who follow them which should make them evolve faster but people need to start thinking for themselves and think about what's more important: being roman catholic or using a condom?<p>I'd say there's only one way you comply to both: if you're married to someone HIV positive and want to procreate. If that's the case, you might want to think about your child which might carry HIV too.<p>edit:
At the end of my post I said ""your child which will probably carry HIV"" but apparently it's not a high probability as pointed by sounddust so I changed it to ""might carry"". Thanks, sounddust!",1271331593

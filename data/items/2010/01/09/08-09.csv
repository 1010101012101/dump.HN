I am sorry, but the wonder of humanity is coming from our differences. I speak French, German, English and Danish, each language allows me to think/reflect on different themes differently. I can express some concepts in German with one word for example ""Schadenfreude"" which would require a complete sentence in French.<p>Now imagine, you are deep into doing some work in German and you need to switch all the time between your ""German"" work and your ""English"" tools because your computer may crash and you may need to copy/paste an error message in a search engine. This is a usability disaster. I am really surprised that lot of HN readers are supporting such idea when  at the same time the majority of people here have high praise for good design and usability.",1263027598

Like Hollywood, California is essentially the birthplace of video games - and in many ways is still considered its Mecca. Like the other HN post about the aspiring web dev who moved to CA to ""make it"", I'm sure others do the same to break into the games industry.<p>Low supply of jobs + huge influx of desperate glamour seekers = massive drop in pay and benefits, and more incentive to abuse (there's a guy who's spent years honing his experience right outside the door ready for you to burn out and quit).",1263027516

The rest of the industry isn't renown for good working conditions, but I can't think of many studios in CA with a good reputation. Could be that the huge programming and artistic talent pool in the state makes it easy for the studios to abuse employees.",1263027325

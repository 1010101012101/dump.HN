7863836,comment,7863303,7863764,3,0,ScottBurson,,,"So you believe that independent inventors and universities are causing great economic damage?  Why?<p>In my mind, the people who are doing damage are those who are taking advantage of the fact that defending oneself against a patent infringement suit is expensive, by suing small businesses with little or no regard to whether they actually infringe; and those taking advantage of low-quality patents that should never have been issued, like the infamous scan-to-email patent.<p>I think that by equating trolls with NPEs, you are losing an important distinction between the ones doing this damage and entities with valid patents that took real R&D to develop, and who are enforcing them against actual infringers.  I don&#x27;t know how you can say that the latter group don&#x27;t deserve to be able to enforce their patent rights, unless you want to discard the entire patent system.<p>In any case I don&#x27;t think your proposal is going to fly.  In contrast, we almost had a bill pass Congress to limit the worst abuses.  I still don&#x27;t understand why this failed.",1402196173

For example, I&#x27;m pretty sure Xcode debugging support for AppleScript doesn&#x27;t even include breakpoints or related features like single-stepping (Apple&#x27;s Script Editor certainly doesn&#x27;t), and that Script Debugger had to pretty much implement its own AppleScript runtime to support these features.<p>On another side note, while Yosemite is the first time Apple has supplied or supported JavaScript as an OSA language, third parties have integrated the Mozilla JavaScript engine into OSA in the past in what I believe is an abandoned project (Google &quot;JavaScript OSA&quot;).",1402195783

No state ever went back and examined the commitment and got refunds—so all rate increases are based on the original ‘commitments’—and changes in the law.<p>In 2005, after they closed the networks to direct competition  they started to do new upgrades--  &quot;FiOS-Verizon&quot; and AT&T, which simply used the old copper wires, added some remote terminals and called it U-Verse.<p>\nYet, Verizon and AT&T were able to charge basic POTS customers -- phone customers in most states for upgrades-- again. -- even if they will never get it.<p>Our new report on Verizon  New York shows that the &#x27;affiliate companies, such as Verizon Online or Verizon Wireless, are able to use the networks and get expenses paid for by regular phone companies-- even though Verizon had announced no more upgrades \nhttp://newnetworks.com/verizonfiostitle2/<p>The cringley numbers are also our stats.<p>The one thing to keep in mind is that we&#x27;ve been tracking this since 1991-- and so every year the numbers are going to increase.<p>... thus differing amounts based on the date.",1402195770

The speculation of multiple stockpiled bombs and at least one test is far beyond feasible; even if they could have afforded the required scale of investment, the facilities and staff involved would be too large to have hidden: it likely would have required literally tens of percent of the entire Japanese industrial base over this period.<p>Second, the enriched uranium gun-based design (Little Boy) required more than 1000 tons of uranium oxide ore for the production of a single bomb, which is as much as the entire supply the author cites (maybe) reaching Japan.<p>Third, the speculation about bomber delivery seems extremely out of touch. Even the (much larger-capacity) B-29 required significant adaptation to deliver the 5-ton Mk 3 (Fat Man) and Little Boy, and, beyond mass, the designs could only barely fit within its fuselage dimensions.<p>Much more likely, all of the source reports were the result of rumors and misunderstandings.

Rarely will I be lucid from the get go.<p>So when I gain &quot;control&quot;, the initial scenario is set. Sometimes, it&#x27;s quite a fascinating &quot;twist&quot; on recent real-life events. Other times it&#x27;s Alice and the Wonderland style craziness.<p>Often I think I&#x27;m in a partially Lucid dream. I <i>know</i> I&#x27;m dreaming, I can mostly do what I want (including completely changing the scenario) but I am also not in control of everything that happens, particularly what characters appear or what they say/do in response to me. It&#x27;s a bit like living in an alternative universe.<p>The strangest aspect is how realistic the characters are, particularly the real-life people. I&#x27;ll be talking to a friend, and get a conversation that is so like that person that I&#x27;ll often forget that it was said in a dream. This has led to some strange real-life conversations, lol.",1402193189

Instead of thinking &quot;The Reference&quot;, most would initially think &quot;Who would want to kill this Referenz guy?&quot;. &#x27;Die&#x27; in English is never pronounced the way it is in German. So while Das Referenz may be awful German, it&#x27;s more evocative of German than the correct term to the English ear. Just a guess, though.",1402192964

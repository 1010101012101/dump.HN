I will be charitable) being overlooked.

And you also may have misinterpreted my citation of Steam.<p>In my view DRM exists because a dying industry is trying to hang on. Refer to the last paragraph. My argument is that DRM is wasteful, ineffective, and the result of an industry that isn't changing.<p>Steam is an example not because of its DRM, but because of its convenience. Steam would be even better without DRM, of course. And I think if there were a competitor to Steam that offered the same service and prices without DRM, people would choose that competitor. I state very clearly that I think DRM is caused by this kind of stagnation, where competitors that could win market share by not being dicks to their customers don't exist.<p>I hope that clarified my point of view.",1262313804

I think that's an excellent part of the current system.</i><p>Nobody ""designed"" this.  That's an artifact of how planes were used in 9/11.  Prior to that, pax sat quietly in hopes that hijackers wouldn't blow up their plane. This is the last line of defense that works in spite of failures that allowed PETN and matches onto planes.<p><i>So, every single person was having their luggage checked AND being patted down - the net result of this ""Chaos"" - my normally 20 minute wait took 90 minutes.</i><p>I'd say a 450% increase in wait times is significant.

The United States has decided they don't want to go down that path, so, even if the El Al system would scale from 37 to 8,000+ Aircraft, it's not politically tenable.</i><p>Even if the racial profiling bit is true - and based on personal experience as well as anecdotes from non-muslim HN posters and friends I'm not sure it is - I'm less interested in what's politically tenable than what's best.

It's like the HN community has collectively proved his point.<p>Anyway, I'm going to respond to the technical article and not the meta-discussion (I guess these paragraphs would be meta-meta discussion then ;-)):<p>Lots of programming languages have run up against the problem of combining interfaces, with various solutions.  In type theory, this is called ""structural subtyping"": inferring the type of an object from the methods it must support.  Ocaml's object system supports it directly.  C++ supports it through ""concepts"" and ""models"", which are the foundation of the STL.  Python, Ruby, and JavaScript call it ""duck typing"".  Go has it built into its interfaces.  Dylan added explicit union and intersection types to the language.<p>I don't really like the proposed syntax, because it requires that you name all of your concepts.  Also, the verbose intersection type-name needs to be carried down to all callers of foo() - so if you had a method bar() that called foo(), it would also need its parameter declared as ReversibleIterator & RemovableIterator.  And if you had a method baz() that might call foo() or might do something with a RandomAccessIterator, its type signature would have to be RandomAccessIterator | ReversibleIterator & RemovableIterator.  You can see where this is going.<p>I'd much rather stick to simple structural subtyping, where you can specify (ideally, it'd be compiler-inferred) that iterator must support the previous() and remove() methods, and any type that provides those may be passed in.",1262312962

The reeducation camps must continue!<p><i>I am telling you this not because I want you to feel sorry for me, but because I want you to understand the danger of writing a well reasoned, logical argument. If you aren't willing to insult and cheat, nobody will ever read what you have to say.</i><p>Okay, let's not confuse a bunch of topics.<p>Topic 1: Rants sell -- just take a look at cable news. People like to watch other people get angry. It's easier than having actual feelings yourself, and there's always the angry-mob ""hell yeah!"" post you can make at the end.<p>Topic 2: Insults are spicy. I've found when dealing with the HN news crowd over the years to say ""bullshit"" instead of ""crap"" and ""hell"" instead of ""heck"". As a former marine, I can curse the chrome off a trailer hitch but learned in my 30s to tone down my language. But, base words sell more than safer words. People love to hear me call you an asshole, even if they like you! But if I respect who you are and ask for clarification of your point? Not so amusing. Better to watch fireworks than not.<p>Topic 3: If I insult you enough, I don't have to listen to your argument. This is where we cross the line from ""how to write for the mob"" to ""how to shut down reasonable debate"". The problem here is that you have entertained us so much we are starting to miss valuable content. For examples of this also see cable news, and some talk radio. This is the Ad Hominem, not the insult. The Ad Hominem is when I am using insult as a tool to prevent you from being heard.<p>Topic 4: Sometimes it's the people you hate the most that have the most to add to a discussion. This is where you really start screwing over the rest of us. You've done a great job of writing a spicy, insult-laden rant. We're all smiling and nodding with vacant stares as we drool over the keyboard awaiting our Pavlovian response queue. Have we learned anything? Hell no! Have we considered any new points of view? Hell no! Have we done much of all except waste our time? Hell no!<p>Good writers present both sides of the discussion as fairly as they can and then proceed to make a case. They have a thesis and work towards proving it. And guess what? That's not easy to do in a way that people like. It takes thought, a good vocabulary, a perspicacious terseness.<p>I read your whole article and it sounded to me like this ""I can't write very well, I'm not patient enough to build up a following, I'm frustrated at the capricious nature of HN, and I can't help but notice how much people like to read other people writing smack""<p>Sure!

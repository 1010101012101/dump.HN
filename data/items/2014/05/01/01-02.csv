Facebook&#x27;s entire history is anti-privacy from the very beginning (here&#x27;s a nice list: <a href=""http://pleasedeletefacebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pleasedeletefacebook.com</a>) and they do their business a disservice by not collecting as much as possible. Facebook users don&#x27;t care about privacy; it&#x27;s the reason they still use the service even after every privacy violation.<p>Trying to spin this into a Facebook vs Google match is absurd.

The only way I can see that happening, is to take away the concept of the end user holding the private-keys. But I don&#x27;t know what bitcoin is without that element to it.

7677752,comment,7677031,7677031,4,0,cookiecaper,,,"The issue is that engineering and design converge insofar as measurable, quantitative data is available for a thing. Good UX is created by good instrumentation that allows for rapid testing and analysis of the way people use your interface as well as an unbiased knowledge of the history of UX. It&#x27;s not exceptionally likely that a random &quot;designer&quot; will have or understand either of these things, and they&#x27;re worthless if they don&#x27;t. What&#x27;s left for the people who call themselves &quot;designers&quot; is really just fashion, and it changes every few years, like all fashions.<p>Clarke&#x27;s Third Law, that good technology is indistinguishable from magic, is apropos in almost any discussion that touches on the osmosis between technical staff and laymen. The laypeople have seen Apple&#x27;s meteoric rise and heard it attributed to &quot;design&quot;, so they think they need a &quot;designer&quot;. But Apple didn&#x27;t get where they are just by hiring random designers. They got where they are by building an entire system that was centered around the vociferous pursuit of a few simple principles. Apple is Apple because they&#x27;ve inextricably ingrained these principles into the corporate DNA. Apple is Apple because they know that &quot;vision&quot; is only a minor part in good industrial design, and because everyone in the company is committed to developing products that exceed expectations along all axes, through art, code, analytics, and other major disciplines.<p>Laypeople see Apple&#x27;s attitude and success and think they just need to hire another plucky, divisive guy with an artsy feel to replicate it. They don&#x27;t understand the work. To them, it&#x27;s all magic, and anyone with a convincing robe and wizard hat is equally competent.",1398909239

You had pedit5, moria, oubliette, krozair, dnd, dungeon, then in 1979 avatar, just to mention but a few. Multi-user dnd games were one of the most popular activities on PLATO all during the mid to late 70s. And these games were all graphics-based, not limited to just text like the far more primitive MUD1.<p>Bartle has gotten a lot of mileage over the years with the MUD1 story, leading to a misinforming of the media and the public, both of whom, when it comes to technology and the history of technology, seem to be perfectly fine with being misinformed. It&#x27;s a shame to see an institution as prestigious as Stanford fall for the same misinformation and ignore the real history.  Five minutes of Wikipedia browsing would have set them straight.<p>I&#x27;m sure MUD1 was very cool during its time, and got a lot of people interested in the ideas of MUDs.

7677744,comment,7676691,7677552,14,0,ufo,,,"Since this is the internet, I would like to nitpick and point out that Dijkstra never said that gotos are always evil. From his considered harmful letter:<p>> In [2] Guiseppe Jacopini seems to have proved the (logical) superfluousness of the go to statement. The exercise to translate an arbitrary flow diagram more or less mechanically into a jump-less one, however, is not to be recommended. Then the resulting flow diagram cannot be expected to be more transparent than the original one.<p>The important thing is to make sure that the state of the program can be modeled by something as static as possible and as close to the source code as possible. Ideally you should be able to tell what is going on just by looking at what line of code you are at and you want to avoid those times where the only way to understand a program is to go back to &quot;main&quot; and keep track of the whole code path that was taken to reach the point you are currently at.<p>So a state machine with gotos is fine since the state machine states are strongly correlated to the source lines of code. On the other hand, an unstructured program translated to a goto-less one via the introduction of lots of &quot;flag&quot; variables is just as hard to understand as the version using gotos.<p>---<p>By the way, the &quot;GOTO considered harmful&quot; letter is smaller than your average blogpost amd is very easy to understand. I highly recommend that everyone should go ahead and read it if you haven&#x27;t done so already :)<p><a href=""http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_T...</a>",1398909094

Which is weird because the author makes a point of distinguishing the two.<p>His confusion probably stems from the assumption that great visual designers will become or should become great product designers. He&#x27;s seeing beautiful products fail, and worried because the visual designers weren&#x27;t solving important problems for users. But why would they be?

Our airspace is complex with lots of rules and regulations to ensure safe separation of aircraft. Trained pilots have enough trouble obeying the rules and being safe, so I question whether someone who has no formal training is capable of doing so. What happens if an inexperienced drone operator is going down the Hudson River corridor without reading up on the radio procedures, while I&#x27;m barreling down at 140 knots? Pilots are trained to look up special airspace before doing a flight, but how would someone who just bought a drone off the shelf be familiar with these practices? There&#x27;s no inherent reason that drones can&#x27;t follow the same procedures and be just as safe as airplanes today, but it&#x27;s dangerous to have the attitude of &quot;buy it off the shelf and go fly it with no training.&quot;<p>The privacy issue doesn&#x27;t concern me as much, since it&#x27;s already possible to rent a helicopter and follow someone around all day.

We should be trying to figure out how to get it into Bitcoin.  YC should fund a company that aims to protect consumers from the risks of Bitcoin.  Something like &quot;trust us with your coins, and if we lose them, then this insurance company is guaranteed to pay you market rate for your losses.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been mulling over whether it&#x27;d be possible for Coinbase to get the equivalent of FDIC insurance.

Either that, or make it trivial for people to manage their own coins as trivially as Coinbase does, which seems implausible.<p>When I point out that credit cards are superior to bitcoin from a consumer perspective, people sometimes counter with &quot;you pay for that with 2% higher merchant fees, etc.&quot;  But that&#x27;s a small price to pay to guarantee you won&#x27;t suddenly be unable to pay your phone bill next month due to theft.

Since I&#x27;m on tools, I didn&#x27;t actually work on the responsive layout stuff, so I won&#x27;t really be able to your questions about how we did that in detail.<p>What I can say is that what you&#x27;re seeing are basically constraints and if you define lots of constraints, you can then use a constraints solver to help you automatically lay out your app on different devices based on rules you&#x27;ve defined. We&#x27;re only beginning to explore these ideas at the moment, but we&#x27;re definitely open to suggestions in the meantime.<p>If you&#x27;re curious to know more about constraints and layout, check out the links below.<p>Regarding the notion of authoring content and then adding the whizz bang later, we&#x27;re definitely interested in solving those problems, but it&#x27;s going to take a while to get there. Ultimately, I think it&#x27;s going to take an approach similar to what ember did, where you take a routes first approach. Once you have your routes, you then create the parts that determine what content/data needs to be show based on those routes. Once you&#x27;re that far you, can then work on two layout strategies: one rendered by the server as static HTML and one that is rendered on the fly in clients with javascript enabled. My hope is that people are super lazy about the static HTML site, basically doing as little design as possible, leaving the final design looking more like the web before frames even existed; i.e. one long scrolling document with anchors jumping to the content you want, and reverse anchors taking you back to where you just were. I&#x27;m even curious if we could get back entirely to document oriented design as a fallback instead of some weird unusable frankenstein we get today when designers eager to make things rich and interactive also attempt make the same design support legacy browsers and the visually impaired.<p>[0] <a href=""http://gridstylesheets.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gridstylesheets.org/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7353944"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7353944</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Introduction/Introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userex...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://harlanhaskins.com/2014/03/02/laying-out-ios-uis-in-code.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://harlanhaskins.com/2014/03/02/laying-out-ios-uis-in-c...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7330683"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7330683</a>",1398908204

As your volumes come and go, you need to make sure it remains available, which is why I imagine erasure coding across a large number of customers.  By integrating with the guest -> host assignment function you can ensure that you never lose data, if need be delaying scheduling until you&#x27;ve copied data elsewhere.<p>You&#x27;d have to throttle reads & writes to ensure that the guests weren&#x27;t unduly impacted (easier with SSD&#x27;s predictable IOPS), and the splitting and erasure coding would make for slow reads & writes as well.

What if Mike Matas (Design Lead for Facebook Paper) wrote an essay about &quot;Why so few people are using Facebook Paper&quot;?<p>(I have no stats on the % of &quot;failure stories&quot; that are written by designers vs engineers vs marketers, but anecdotally it seemed to ring true to me.)<p>So why is it that designers don&#x27;t like talking about their failed designs? I thought about it long and hard but couldn&#x27;t think of a good reason why that might be. Would love to hear your thoughts on the matter!",1398907008

But for some number of years prior to 1982 I had coaxed my parents into getting me a subscription to Popular Electronics.  They often had &quot;computer&quot; articles where one could build one&#x27;s own computer from discrete components and a CPU.  This was the days when an 8080 or a Z80, a breadboard, and a few misc. TTL logic chips could almost suffice to build an actual computer.<p>Then for Christmas of 1980 or 1981 (I no longer remember which) a Sinclair ZX-81 was under the tree.  If it was 1980 I would have then been 13.  The ZX got a bunch of usage, but being chained to it&#x27;s audio cassette tape interface for storage (read: didn&#x27;t work so well....) meant most of the usage was pure play, like printing 1-100 to the screen and so forth.  Which when one is 13, and &quot;programming&quot; a computer for the first time, seems magical.<p>1982 plays a key role because in 1982, my parents (well, more my Dad, but) decided to get an Atari 800.  Auspiciously the reason was so that Dad could automate the weekly task of computing the score-sheet for his bowling league (he was secretary of the league at that time, and one of his tasks was calculating up the weekly averages, scores, handicaps, etc.)  Well, Dad wasn&#x27;t (and still isn&#x27;t) any form of a computer programmer, so the reality was that I was &quot;volunteered&quot; to write the program that would automate the league calculation work.<p>That &quot;task&quot;, which I gladly took up, so I voluntarily volunteered myself, would be how/why I got my &quot;start&quot;.

Most relevantly, the author of this article gives lip service in the first few paragraphs to the idea that design is how the system works, then reviews them based on the surface UI.  He doesn&#x27;t seem to look at the sync protocols of sync-focused apps!",1398906275

State machines are a fine example of this.  In languages that lack goto but <i>do</i> have tail call optimization (such as many functional languages), you can safely substitute mutual recursion.  Then functions become your states, and transitions are tail calls.  Lambda is, after all, the ultimate goto [2].<p>Edit: forgot the links -_-<p>[1]: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20090320002214/http://www.ecn.purdue.edu/ParaMount/papers/rubin87goto.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20090320002214/http://www.ecn.pur...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5753/AIM-443.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5753/AIM-443.p...</a>",1398906269

Is it still in flux, or is it considered done?<p>Of course the Go team is aware of this, but once youÂ support dynamic linking, ABIs become very hard to change. A bad one will weigh you down for a long time! Apple famously used PC-relative addressing on PowerPC, which has no program counter register.

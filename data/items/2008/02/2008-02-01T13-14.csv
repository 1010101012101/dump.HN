I guess this means you write sequences of commands (procedures), and you store data in a state system. Well, in that case, Lisp gets turned into procedures and a state system, seemingly by magic.<p>Maybe people have an easier time understanding other languages because they work in the same way the computer does.",1201872375

107794,comment,107768,107768,0,0,DaniFong,,,"""The third lesson I teach kids is indifference.  I teach children not to care about anything too much, even though they want to make it appear that they do.  How I do this is very subtle.  I do it by demanding that they become totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation, competing vigorously with each other for my favor.  It's heartwarming when they do that, it impresses everyone, even me.  When I'm at my best I plan lessons very carefully in order to produce this show of enthusiasm.  But when the bell rings I insist that they stop whatever it is that we've been working on and proceed quickly to the next work station.  They must turn on and off like a light switch.  Nothing important is ever finished in my class, nor in any other class I know of.  Students never have a complete experience except on the installment plan.<p>Indeed, the lesson of the bells is that no work is worth
finishing, so why care too deeply about anything?  Years of bells will condition all but the strongest to a world that can no longer offer important work to do.  Bells are the secret logic of schooltime; their argument is inexorable.  Bells destroy the past and future, converting every interval into a sameness, as an abstract map makes every living mountain and river the same even though they are not.  Bells inoculate each undertaking with indifference.""",1201872119

Yahoo's taken a real big hit, likely for several reasons that are beyond its control, and it might very well be undervalued. This could be a great chance for MS to give an offer price that Yahoo was trading at a month ago but now seems generous.",1201871189

Lucene, Hadoop, the Javascript lib - they're releasing a lot of good stuff.<p>Not really sure what it would mean for both companies, too.  They have a lot of overlapping businesses, but very different approaches.  What a wreck it would be trying to transition Yahoo to Windows servers.",1201871185

Now I generally use both: I find that chrome is a snappier startup and has a better flash runtime (since it does its own rather than relying on adobe). Firefox is more stable / uses less memory for a larger number of tabs.<p>I do believe in the mozilla mission for an open web, and it's got fairly comparable performance overall, so I use it for my main browsing / firebug. Chrome's for flash-heavy sites and playing with webrtc occasionally.<p>Inspector on chrome has certainly become quite good -- I've missed firebug less and less over time as I started using it. Though Firefox's new built-in developer tools are really sweet and might add enough functionality for me to miss in the near future. They're adding a command line thing that is super cool!!",1342698952

4265537,comment,4264180,4265244,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"Chronic stress and sleep deprivation are known to have horrible effects on personal health -- up to, and including, fat storage and cardiovascular fitness. The extent of these effects has not received enough attention, and may be greater than we currently realize. I strongly suspect that, in the next ten or so years, we'll see a surge of scientific studies documenting the importance of these factors on health.<p>Over the last few decades, much fuss has been made over the societal switch from whole foods to processed foods. But people have been getting less and less healthy every decade, obesity rates have been increasing each decade, and food hasn't grown all <i>that</i> substantially more processed in the last few decades. (People in the 70s and 80s ate nearly as much processed junk as we do, and they were healthier on average. People in, say, Japan eat a metric fuckton of foods processed beyond our recognition, and they're healthier than we are).<p>Processed foods are probably to blame for our obesity crisis in some respect, but they're not the single issue. We should be taking a closer look at lifestyle factors, especially sleep and stress. Americans don't sleep enough, and lead more stressful work lives, than the citizens of almost any other developed country on the planet. (It's actually debatable if we're more or less sedentary than other nations, too. Pretty much everyone in white-collar work is sedentary these days, by the clinical definition of the term, and working out even an hour a day is not going to completely mitigate the effects of sitting on one's ass for the following 10 hours).",1342698940

4265528,comment,4255773,4256172,2,0,register,,,"I have used all 3 of them. Here are my impressions:<p>-Marmalade ( Airplay when I used it ) is the most professional framework. I have never found a bug and also the number of documented bugs is very low. The framework is supported on many platforms ( IOS,Android,Ipad,Bata, Nokia,Windows CE, [Blackberry also if i remember well]and also consoles if you are willing to spend some more big bucks). It is possible to develop on windows using Visual Studio and one can obtain installations packages (ipa,apk and so on) with a single click without ever leaving windows. The framework is pretty low level so you are going to write more code using a more robust platform. Documentation is very complete. The framework has also some tools for asset packaging, fonts, etc. Both 2d and 3d apps are supported. There is also a basic GUI engine that is resolution/device indipendent ( with a basic GUI designer ).<p>- Moai is the easiest framework to use if you are willing to use LUA as your main development language. However I have found it a little bit counterintuitive if you want primarly to do C++ development. Documentation is sufficient. 2D games only. MOAI license put some constraint on apps that  store information on the internet/cloud and/or have multiplayer support<p>- Cocos2d-x is a community effort. I found it more convenient for pure C++ development than Moai. Cocos2d-x API is modeled after Objective-C and sometimes uses Obj-C idioms instead of C++ idioms. While this considerably ease the porting from pure Obj-C Cocos2d app it may not be to everyone taste especially for experienced C++ developers.\nCocos2d-x community is bigger than Moai's. While Cocos2d community is very activy on further developing cocos2d-x and fixing bugs Moia community is more active on the development of extensions and new features. 2d games only. Support for lua even if I have not used it.Almost no documentation. However the API is a 1 to 1 mapping of Cocos2d for which there is an abudance of information.<p>At the end these are my suggestions:<p>- You are a big studio-> go for Marmelade.Documentation is better, you have professional support and probably the framework is the most stable and certainly the more mature.<p>- You are a small/indie studio and like to code in Lua-> go for MOAI.<p>-You are a small/indie studio  and prefer pure C++ coding and not be constrained in any way by the license-> go for Cocos2d-x.<p>After using Airplay when it was free now I am using cocos2d-x for my new projects.",1342698784

I have started to hear more stories about folks switching back to Firefox because a lot of their issues with the browser have been fixed. And based on independent review sites like Tom's Hardware, there is no longer an appreciable gap in the performance of Firefox and Chrome.<p>As regards market share, Firefox's market share would be in the low single-digit percentages if all was lost. This is indeed not the case. With the profiling and telemetry tools and infrastructure, the Firefox team has built a foundation that will ensure future releases do not regress memory usage and overall browser snappiness. Market share is a fickle metric for success because it is amenable to change. The strides made in the last few months by the Firefox team have paved the way for adoption growth in the future. Let us have a constructive conversation around what they need to do next to ensure more switchers among the HN community.",1342698744

Browser is very portable though<p>- I would recommend to make it like an open platform where 3rd party developers may contribute - so that your model could scale. At the same time - you need to do marketing homework first in order to get visitors on board and then become attractive to those 3rd parties. You will become infrastructure provider in this case and this is slightly another kind of business.<p>- Don't do many things at once. Focus on typical and most frequent workflows so that you can do less but at better quality<p>- You will hold lots of personal data, think about how to ensure clients that they are safe, there are back-ups and there is no vendor lock-in.",1342698600

Simple as that.""<p>Real answer: \nThere is a popular band inside, which has caused more people to walk into the building in a given 3 hour period than leave it.<p>The ""too many calories"" people (you are one of them)all think that the effect of a bad diet (which is often bad caloric partitioning in the body, causing plummeting energy levels as fat cells steal nutrients from the rest of the body, causing a fat person to feel tired and hungry) is also the root cause.<p>Do kids grow because they eat more?  No.  They eat more because they are in a growth spurt.  Obesity works the same way.  A bad diet wreaks havoc on the endocrine system, mainly with insulin levels, causing excessive fat accumulation due to calories being partitioned to fat cells at the expense of the rest of the body.

The first major issue is the coercion involved: they control  a child's life for 9 years (or even 12 years in some countries). It's absurd. This alone should be reason enough to dissolve the entire public school system (and possibly put various Ministers of Eduction to trial).<p>The second major issue is that they are a tool the state uses to indoctrinate children (naive by nature) with whatever the correct values of the day are. Prussia (where public schooling originated) needed obedient soldiers, modern-day Sweden needs a large underclass of socialists willing to support various hare-brained political schemes. The schools reflect this. What happens, for instance, if you call homosexuality ""not normal""[1] in a Swedish school? It gets you an F in biology and a label as a ""homophobe"" in the state-run media[2].

You could say that a Dropbox repo is like a list of references to non-redundant files hosted by Dropbox.<p>In finding any disagreeable content, I believe the implication was that Dropbox could map it the other way around from the infracting file to a list of users with the file's hash.",1342696106

So -O1 would run the optimizer for 1 second and give me the best optimized code it could come up with in that time. -O3600 would let the machine think about it for an hour, using any and all heuristics and empirical tests and then giving me what it had at the end.

Oil companies continue to exert immense influence over governments because of the taxes they pay and the contributions they make to politicians and their parties. That's meant to be ""countered"" with mundane jokes on fake twitter profiles and memes on reddit? Forgive me for being cynical. If anything it's a great situation for oil companies. It gives people the illusion they're actually doing something when really it means nothing and the status quo remains.",1342695984

7278266,comment,7277797,7277797,1,0,benmmurphy,,,"i find messaging between processes and handle exits can be a bit awkward as well.<p>for example if you send a message to a process there is no way to know whether it actually received the message or not. if you wait for a reply from the process then you can tell if the process received your message AND processed it but sometimes you only want to do the first for performance as well as semantic reasons. for example you may not want to retry sending a message that has crashed a process. i think this is because erlang wants to be network transparent and with the network you obviously can&#x27;t be 100% sure whether your message was received or not.<p>handling exit()s is a bit weird as well. you get a message which is like {&#x27;EXIT&#x27;, pid_that_called_exit_or_the_pid_you_are_linked_to}. so you need to know who would call exit() on you to handle exits correctly (OTP assumes only your parent will call exit on you) or assume that you will know all your linked pids correctly at all times and if you get an exit for a pid that is not linked then assume it is for you. i think it would much cleaner if there was a way to differentiate between an EXIT from a linked pid and an EXIT from yourself.",1393005377

This tends to work best with extroverts. Dinners work best for singles and lunches work best for people with families (who may have to go home to a spouse and kids).<p>+ Movies - If there&#x27;s a movie that most of your team wants to see, treat them. This may give introverts a more comfortable setting, since not everyone likes team lunches & dinners. I sometimes reserved a dark conference room and played episodes of Futurama (or some other TV show my team wanted to watch) during lunch, which worked just as well.<p>+ Outings, activities - Not everyone may enjoy a particular activity, like a hike or indoor rock climbing gym. But you can offer various activities to your team as opportunities to get to know one another. Don&#x27;t make those who cannot or do not want to get involved feel ostracized, however. Make these optional events.<p>+ Code reviews, paired programming, tech talks, hackathons - These exercises not only strengthen the skills of your team, but improve team bonding as well. And chances are, all of your developers want to improve their own skills, so any chance to do that is a good thing.<p>+ One-on-ones - Sit down with each team member and have a chat with her/him. This is not easy for every engineering manager, as it requires skills in listening, empathy, conflict resolution, etc. The goal here is to truly listen. If something is bothering your developer, chances are you&#x27;ll be able to pick it up here, giving you a chance to resolve it before it becomes a major issue. I&#x27;ve had developers tell me they felt like these chats were therapy sessions, though I did my best not to make it feel so clinical (in some cases, these chats were over coffee, ping pong, a walk, etc). The point is, listen.<p>There are many more that I&#x27;ve forgotten and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve done (and please do share!)<p>I never had a problem with attrition by employing tactics like these.

Since Go is a mutable-state language, and also a shared-state language (isolation is by convention, not by language design), you have to live with the consequences of that. In my supervisor tree implementation, the restart of a monitored goroutine is just to fire off a new goroutine on the exact same object again; if you still have bad state lying around and immediately crash again, well, too bad, the supervisor can&#x27;t do anything about that. (Except not thrash the processor with endless restarts.) In contrast, when an Erlang supervisor restarts a process, it is <i>guaranteed</i> to be a fresh process with no shared state from the one that just crashed. It&#x27;s much more likely to not immediately crash.<p>(I fiddled with having the user specify a closure that is supposed to &quot;create&quot; a new object for the restart, but then simplified that away when I realized that the closure itself could well have mutable state too. Better just to stick with the simpler interface and document the consequences of failing to clean out state at the beginning of your monitored code. On the plus side, so far the interface for the supervised-things is &quot;Serve()&quot; and &quot;Stop()&quot;, and nothing else; hard to argue with that level of simplicity!)<p>You also won&#x27;t ever be able to recover live code restarts; you can <i>try</i> to transfer all state to a new process, including file handles, but that&#x27;s a lot of implementation work. (I&#x27;m stuck right now on the fact that my connections are encrypted, and the encryption code won&#x27;t let me even get to the state, let alone transfer and reconstitute it somewhere else. Someone&#x27;s got some code for moving file handles around on GitHub but I can&#x27;t seem to Google it up.) Most people already live in a world where live restarts are difficult or impossible, though, so they won&#x27;t <i>miss</i> that. Getting a REPL into a live Go server is impossible, at least with Go itself, and will also probably never be as clean as Erlang. (Go &quot;2.0&quot; could fix that with an official Go interpreter, which is the missing bit. I can handle the sockets, I can bind readline and give you a nicer REPL, but interpreting Go is a challenge. Progress is being made, I believe as part of the new compiler implementation, but I&#x27;m not sure anyone has this as an explicit goal.) Again, most people live in a world where they already don&#x27;t have a REPL into their running code, and therefore won&#x27;t miss this.<p>There&#x27;s also some more subtle semantic differences, but I&#x27;m saving that for a blog post. (It gets long, especially if I first have to explain Erlang, which is what the blog post does.)",1393004496

[...] You don&#x27;t see big investments in new technology, science, infrastructure, or other complex and difficult areas because by and large the financiers do not understand these things.<p>To me, this is saying: tech, science, and infrastructure and undercapitalized relative to their expected returns. It is very difficult for me to construct a model in which a) capital is foolishly providing too little capital to certain sectors relative to the returns it should get, and b) those sectors <i>don&#x27;t</i> provide outsized returns to the capital they <i>do</i> get.<p>Of course, such a model is <i>possible</i>! It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that returns are random but allocations are still irrational. But what does such a model look like?<p>One possibility is that returns are <i>totally</i> unrelated to the underlying performance of an asset. For example: new technology is a more rational allocation of capital, and would provide greater return, but it doesn&#x27;t, because return is totally disconnected from the performance of the technology.<p>To me, that possibility seems quite unlikely. Yes, the anti-EMH position holds that prices frequently depart from their underlying value--but the idea that there is <i>zero</i> connection, as would be required by such a model, is not tenable. It&#x27;s absolutely clear that real-world events have effects on asset prices. If, say, Oculus Rift becomes extremely popular with consumers, the capital that invested in it will receive large returns.<p>Another possibility is that there are network effects that make it impossible to make the excess returns from these sectors unless the rest of the financial sector decides to invest in these sectors as well. But it&#x27;s very difficult to see what those network effects might be, and it&#x27;s even more difficult to imagine that they are present for <i>all</i> productive investments in these sectors.<p>Unpredictability of asset returns is <i>the</i> primary testable prediction of the EMH. On the other hand, it is difficult to construct a reasonable anti-EMH position that incorporates the observed unpredictability of asset returns.<p>Finally, if the claim that the market is ignoring great opportunities because of stupidity or irrationality does <i>not</i> imply that there are excess returns available on investments in those great opportunities, it&#x27;s frankly difficult to see what the claim means. If I say &quot;you should invest in my startup, because it&#x27;s a more intelligent allocation of your capital than real estate--but no, I do not expect that you&#x27;ll earn higher returns from my startup than you would from another investment,&quot; it&#x27;s pretty difficult to understand what I actually mean by &quot;more intelligent allocation.&quot;",1393004448

There are a large number of factors here (growth potential, job security, the possibility of age discrimination at 40 or younger, where, when and how you like to work...), so I&#x27;m not saying that this tell the whole story - but there&#x27;s a decent argument to be made that nursing may be a better paid and more stable field than software development over the course of a career.  Would women be well served by reducing that 90% to 50% to free up more women to become software engineers?<p>Another interesting thing to note - since we&#x27;re talking about flagship UC&#x27;s here, the entering medical school class at UCSF is 58% women, and at boalt law school, it is 54%.  I couldn&#x27;t get exact numbers for pharmacy, but nationally, it skews female over male.  Again, would women be well served by diverting some of these students to computer science rather than remaining in health care?  A friend of mine who is an emergency room physician probably earns over twice the average software developers salary with fewer hours and very flexible shifts.  I can&#x27;t possibly claim she would have been better off in computer science.<p>I have a tough time with this, for a couple of reasons.  First, I have no right to claim sour grapes for someone else.  If women want to go into computer science, and feel that it is a great field, they should not have to put up with gender discrimination.<p>Second, it&#x27;s unclear as to whether software development is wonderful field.  So not only do I have no right to tell others that the grapes are sour, I can&#x27;t say with certainty that they are sour.<p>However, I do think that there is, at least a very clear case to be made that the grapes in health care are a lot sweeter than they are in the high tech world.<p>We need to consider, seriously, the possibility that avoidance of high tech in favor of health fields is a very rational choice from an earnings, working conditions, job security, and social prestige perspective.  Young women are, in many ways, outperforming young men.  Perhaps appreciating the beauty and joy of computer programming as a short detour on your road to emergency medicine or dermatology is a far more rational way to go through life than majoring in CS and getting a grad degree in a STEM field, or working for as series of startups or bigco&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m not asking people to accept this conclusion, but rather to recognize that this question needs to be part of the debate.",1393004422

The biggest thing I see is the lack of module/library/package management.  CPAN was a big deal.  It is now expected that every language have their own CPAN.  I think the lack of one is a huge problem for any language, erlang being a good example.  I think it is also a big reason that ocaml and haskell went from being &quot;ocaml is the more commonly used one&quot; to &quot;haskell has ten times the userbase of ocaml&quot;.",1393003548

Japanese uses syllabaries (&#x27;kana&#x27; in Japanese), where almost all characters represent more than 1 sound. Hiragana is typically used to write Japanese words and grammatical particles, while katakana is typically used to write foreign words and for special emphasis, roughly analogous to how boldface type is used in English. Both of these kana are derived from Chinese characters, greatly simplified, though the relationship is somewhat distant.<p>Japanese also uses a third writing system called kanji, also not an alphabet, whose name literally means &quot;Han [Chinese] characters&quot; in Japanese. Kanji are logographs, where one character represents one entire word or concept rather than sounds.<p>Most kanji are identical or very similar to modern Chinese characters and are readily intelligible to a Chinese reader, at least in a general sense, though some have diverged a bit.<p>Grammar is another matter entirely. Japanese is a language isolate, a language that is not related to any other known language. (Someone will reply that it&#x27;s distantly related to Korean, but this is a fringe theory in linguistics that is not widely accepted.)

It demonstrates a program that implements a factorial function, then tells me to go write games. Other than &quot;Burn the CPU&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure what kind of games I can write with what I learned here.<p>The first link to more documentation at the bottom of the page goes to a book&#x27;s website, so that&#x27;s a dead end.

7277976,comment,7277797,7277797,7,0,seiji,,,"Short answer: You have to be slightly smarter than average to use it properly.<p>Longer answer: The only proper way to learn Erlang is to read the documentation.  Then re-read the documentation.  All of it.  It takes 3-6 months to get proficient, then another 6 months to stop doing things the native or outright bad way.<p>If you are primarily an &quot;erlang programmer,&quot; you can&#x27;t interview for jobs.  Everybody hires for either java, ruby, or python.  If you do see a rare &quot;Erlang job&quot; position, they probably actually mean &quot;We want you to understand ejabberd because we based our company around it and it&#x27;s actually unusable at scale, so you get to fix other people&#x27;s problems all day long.&quot;  (Of course, building your own company/services around Erlang stops the &quot;need to interview in other languages&quot; problem.)<p>But, why can&#x27;t you interview in Erlang?  I guess you can, but the way I work, I have an editor in one window and API docs in the other.  Interviewers, sitting up there on their oh-so-high perches, don&#x27;t like it when candidates want to do quick API lookups for things like parameter order or return values.  (Does it take (Fun, List) or (List, Fun)?  Does it return Value or {ok, Value} or {value, Value}?)<p>Short conclusion: Erlang is a <i>system</i> and understanding systems takes effort and practice.  People, in general, don&#x27;t want to learn, they want to do.  It&#x27;s the whole &quot;one year of experience 15 times over&quot; instead of 15 years of growth and advancement problem.  It&#x27;s the &quot;person with 20 years in computing can&#x27;t write a tail recursive function&quot; problem.  It&#x27;s just a problem.<p>Alternative question: why don&#x27;t people understand defmacro (and recursive defmacro) and write their programs from the bottom up?<p>Bonus analysis: In a world where people just want to learn one thing and use it forever, Erlang doesn&#x27;t fit.  With Python, you can learn it once then keep &quot;extending&quot; it to pretend to get concurrency and other fancy features Python actively rejects at the implementation level.  So, you learn Python once, then feel productive because you&#x27;re duplicating functionality given to you for free in other languages.<p>Erlang has so much &quot;done right the first time&quot; built into its VM you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have to reinvent basic parallel computing every time you want to get two webpages at once or serve more than one client at a time from a basic five line server.  But—Erlang people know for other tasks, say something better served by numpy, they should jump over to Python or Lua or something else better suited to the task <i>without</i> reimplementing all of the &quot;they did it right the first time&quot; code in Erlang just because they refuse to learn any other language.",1393002901

C++ is excellent for this. I use a lot of Python for rapid prototyping, and as glue code. When I need to do concurrency, it&#x27;s usually the easiest thing to run multiple instances in parallel, or to submit jobs to a cluster. There is already a well-tested infrastructure in place, and I don&#x27;t need all the fancy stuff erlang has in this area.<p>Second, but more important, my colleagues know C++ (good enough at least). If I started to use something else, we couldn&#x27;t collaborate. We&#x27;re physicists, not computer scientists or professional programmers.<p>Then, I often find myself writing GUI code. I wouldn&#x27;t know how to start writing a GUI in Erlang, but it&#x27;s trivial in Python or C++.<p>If anything, I would need a language centered around <i>mutability</i>, so almost the opposite of erlang. A language where everything is mutable, where you can databind to any object. Where you can just make an array of objects and bind it to a graphical widget, and get create, edit, update, delete operations for free. You never have to write `listview.insert(...)`. Maybe the command pattern is part of the language and it is trivial to write an undo function. And finally, it would include multithreading, with only a simple syncronization primitive, the transaction. The goal of concurrency here would not be speed, but GUI responsiveness.<p>So, I have two very different use cases, for one I can use C++, for the other the ideal language has not been invented (but C# and Python are both not bad). I just don&#x27;t know what to do with Erlang (and Haskell, Clojure, and all the other hip languages).",1393002895

Similarly, Clojure&#x27;s datomic, core async, etc. are interesting ideas, implemented by people with good taste.<p>However, too many examples show trivial things like mapping over a list or calculating something recursively. As a professional programmer, I get how those things wrok. What sets these languages apart from Javas of the world is how state is handled. It isn&#x27;t easy to dig through tutorials and docs to find the best way of keeping state, updating it, referencing it, etc.<p>I once attempted to implement a small order matcher (from the stock trading world) in Erlang.

If Erlang was written with an Algol-esque syntax it would have taken off years ago. But instead it has this weird syntax, which it then doesn&#x27;t really <i>do</i> that much with. What do I mean by that? Haskell has a radically different syntax, but it <i>does</i> things with that syntax and its pervasive currying to enable a powerful succinctness that one can not imagine being translated back into the Algol-esque framework. Lisp <i>does</i> things with its bizarre syntax, making it obvious how to write correct macros and being homoiconic, which translates poorly back into Algol-esque infix languages. It&#x27;s almost inconceivable that one could translate a concatenative program back into Algol-esque syntax [2]. But Erlang really doesn&#x27;t do anything that couldn&#x27;t be in Algol-esque syntax. (Near existance proof: Go. Yes, there are significant differences, but the two are inter-transliterable to a much greater degree than any pairing of any of the previous sets of language families.)<p>If it had an Algol syntax, and performed the SSA transform behind the scene, it would probably be very, very big now.<p>Bear in mind as I say this that I&#x27;m not necessarily <i>advocating</i> for those changes. For instance, this would require some tweaks to the semantics of pattern matching, too, which aren&#x27;t necessarily for the better... in the abstract. However, they probably would be for the better in terms of usage.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Go is going to eat Erlang. Erlang programmers will 100% absolutely correctly complain that OTP can&#x27;t be translated without loss into Go, and almost nobody will care. Again, I&#x27;m not necessarily advocating for this, because the Erlang advocates will be <i>right</i>, you just can&#x27;t quite get it fully expressed in Go and that saddens me, it&#x27;s just what&#x27;s going to happen, I think.<p>In fact I&#x27;m doing it myself; the Erlang core of my system is getting pulled out and replaced by Go for a variety of reasons, and one is despite the fact my team is fairly adventurous over all, we&#x27;re still better off finding people to work on Go than Erlang. (In the next couple of months I hope to release my first release of &quot;reign&quot;, &quot;Rewrite Erlang In Go Nicely&quot;, which brings some of the Erlang stuff into Go for the purpose of porting existing programs. I&#x27;ve been pulled into other fire fighting so I&#x27;m not on it this second, but I&#x27;ll be getting back to it soon. That implements Erlang-like mailboxes and network clustering, and I&#x27;ve got a supervisor tree implementation on deck for Github too. Subscribe to <a href=""https://github.com/thejerf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thejerf</a> to see when those come out in the next couple of months.)<p>By the way, Erlang advocates, bear in mind that trying to argue <i>me</i> out of this position is a waste of time. I&#x27;ve been programming in Erlang for 7 years now. I get the syntax just fine, even if I still don&#x27;t like it. The problem is that you have to argue the greater programming community out of this position, and I don&#x27;t think you have, and I really doubt you can. For better or worse, being non-Algol seems to put a hard limit on your general-purpose programming acceptance. (In my opinion, that is for the worse, but here we are. Again, please don&#x27;t mistake this opinion as <i>celebration</i> of any of these facts. My <i>opinion</i> is that Erlang deserves better. My <i>belief</i> is that it won&#x27;t get it.)<p>[1]: That&#x27;s pretty much every modern mainstream language today: C(/++/#), Java, Python, Javascript, etc. Not all those languages come from the same <i>semantic</i> heritage (scripting vs. conventional OO manifest types being one big example), but they come from the same syntactic heritage. Contrast with the ML family, the Lisp family, the Prolog family (which is pretty much just Erlang now), and the Forth family for different syntactic heritages.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com.es/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com.es/2012/02/why-concatena...</a>",1393002708

7277942,comment,7277035,7277035,1,0,chriswarbo,,,"We can think of methods in Object Oriented programming as functions with their first argument (self/this/etc.) curried.<p>This is a very limited form of currying though, since a) only the first argument gets curried and b) in order to access these curried functions (methods), we have to qualify them with the object they&#x27;re inside. This pretty much &#x27;cancels out&#x27; any syntactic saving we might have hoped for.<p>For example, compare these two implementations of the same algorithm:<p><pre><code>    foo = function(this, x) { run(this, x, x); }\n    foo(obj, 10);\n\n    class Bar {\n      function bar(x) { this.run(x, x); }\n    }\n    obj.bar(10);\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;foo&quot; implementation requires us to pass in an explicit object parameter like &quot;obj&quot;, which is then explicitly passed along to the &quot;run&quot; function. However, the &quot;bar&quot; functions are wrapped in objects, so we must specify which one we want in order to call it (eg. &quot;obj.bar&quot;). Likewise, inside &quot;bar&quot; we must look up the &quot;run&quot; function inside &quot;this&quot;, so we&#x27;ve not actually gained anything here; we&#x27;ve just shuffled the tokens around!",1393002568

I was arguing more on the side of ""familiarity with algorithms"" is like ""hitting the gym"" irrespective of what game/sport you play. It either helps you directly, or gives you general skill.<p>I was mostly taking exception to  conflating ""great programmers - no algorithmic knowledge"".<p>It's great that you figured out A* search in under 30 seconds, but that's because you had the foundation. As I said, I am not claiming A* search(or any other algorithm) is the baseline, but there is a baseline(I won't bother enumerating algorithms - there is no agreed upon list), and a good programmer should strive to be above that baseline. Simply putting your hands up and claiming I can develop large systems fine and hence algorithmic knowledge is not really helpful - it is counter productive.<p>Again, if it's working fine for the poster, that's great. But the poster might be missing ""unknown unknowns.""",1328885926

3575990,comment,3575449,3575688,4,0,TheCapn,,,"Without a goal or focus it can be hard to find algorithms that have meaning. Writing algorithms without a goal leaves you without focus and, although you may have written some good functions it'll be harder to know where they can be properly applied without some form of goal or project to work towards.<p>To me, an appropriate way to learn is to conceptualize a goal. If what you want to start with is a calculator then make one using only the basic +, - operators and maybe binary functions if you care to. Modulus, Multiplication, Power functions, Division and others can be accomplished with simple uses of +/- and building up from there.<p>For me, a good project was a mobile game that uses a home built physics engine. Collission detection, ""bouncing"", gravity and the complexity of sprite drawing/manipulation was enough of a goal to apply moderately complex trig that was essential in school. I now have a portfolio of very diverse and extremely useful sprite functions that I built on my own that I can reuse in other projects.<p>I wrote my own heuristic algorithm for battleship that I'd argue is the best possible AI without allowing it to have memory or cheating... it all started with looking at the problem space and determining how simple things I already know (stats) applied to the problem and figured how to apply it from there.",1328885689

A good programmer is someone who can properly identify the right tools for the job and adequitely apply them to the given scenario.<p>A good programmer knows why one algorithm of a certain classification is right for the job. He/she may not be able to memorize it to put it down but they know why one would need to apply it and can then consult notes/google for its implementation.<p>Patterns are a good example of this. If someone can conceptualize the problem they're facing clearly enough to know that they need a facade that signals a good programmer.

You don't drive a screw with a hammer in the same way you don't use certain algorithms for the task you have in front of you.

I don't like books that are written under the assumption that I will be sitting at a computer as I read them, and expect me to be typing in code and running it for everything they cover.<p>If I can't find a satisfactory book, I'll cobble together something from what I can find on Safari Library, free online books, and assorted internet searching.<p>A while back I tried an interesting experiment. I needed to learn some Lua, because I wanted to write some add-ons for an MMORPG I was playing (Warhammer Online). Lua has pretty good documentation, but I had recently read that famous article on digital natives vs. digital immigrants, whose theses was that digital natives (people who grew up in the digital world) have a fundamentally different understanding of technology than those of us who grew up in the pre-digital age and immigrants to the digital world. The natives are multitasking do-ers, who want to learn things as they need them. They aren't, supposedly, like the immigrants, who think the way to learn things is to read a book, then start doing.<p>I decided to take a more native approach with Lua to see how that worked out. So, instead of reading the Lua documentation, I downloaded and looked at a few Warhammer Online add-ons to see how they were structured and get a feel for what Lua code looks like. I looked at the Wikipedia article on Lua to get an idea of what kind of things the language had.<p>Then I started coding. Whenever I wanted to do something that I knew the language could do, but didn't know how, I Googles. So, for example, the first time I wanted to initialize an array with literal constants, I'd Google for that.<p>This actually worked. I don't know if my Lua code is any good, but comparing to what I see on other people's add-ons, it seems in the same league at least. I would not put ""Lua programmer"" on my resume just yet--I'll wait until I actually read a complete manual before doing that. I did a similar experiment with JavaScript, with similar results.<p>I'm not convinced, though, that the ""native"" approach is actually good. Yes, I got satisfactory results, but I think much of that has to do with the fact that I've been a professional programmer for 30 years. That has given me good filters for recognizing bad code, so when I'd Google for how to do something and get back and answer that turned out to not be a good way to do whatever it was, I'd sense that and keep looking. Someone with just a couple years or less experience would probably have incorporated a lot more things from the bad examples on the net.",1328884108

3575853,comment,3575029,3575029,2,0,jcr,,,"As it so happens, I've spent the last day trying to break in through the
technical restrictions of a regime from the outside. There is a country
with a very oppressive government that prevents outsiders from observing
them. It's a tiny island monarchy that doesn't matter much in the grand
scheme of things, but you may have heard of them; it's called the
""United Kingdom"" or ""Great Britain"" or whatever.<p>If you don't live within their control, they don't want you to see the
propaganda they put out on their ""British Broadcasting Corporation""
(BBC) television stations and web site. Needless to say, there are ways
around their entirely pointless technical restrictions.<p>(Note_To_Self: As somewhat dyslectic person, I'll never forgive patio11
for nick-naming his product ""BCC"").<p>I would like to say that by-passing government sanctioned Internet
restrictions is simple and easy, but it's not true. Doing it safely can
be impossible at times, and considering the rather severe punishments
for getting caught (i.e. death), it may not be the smartest choice you
could make. If you want to take your chances, there are often
technically possible ways to by-pass the restrictions. It's not easy,
and it may not be entirely safe, but usually, it <i>is</i> technically
possible.<p>There are free solutions out there like Tor (""The Onion Router""
<a href=""https://www.torproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/</a>), but they mostly suck. If you don't believe
me, then just try using them. The other problem with the free solutions
is a lot of government filtering knows about them and adjusts
accordingly (when possible). There is also a lot of monitoring an
profiling done on the traffic on the free solutions like Tor since the
traffic <i>is</i> interesting.<p>If you need a solution that sucks less, you'll need to pay for it. As
much as many would like to believe otherwise, bandwidth and servers are
not free, so when a service is unable to support itself through
advertising, then you'll need to pay for it. The commercial VPN vendors
are more reliable and have far better security, privacy and performance
than the free alternatives.<p>I've been a paying customer of <a href=""https://www.tunnelr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tunnelr.com</a> for over a year,
and really enjoy their service. I'm on friendly terms through email with
the two founders, Daniel and Jared, so I'm probably guilty of some sock
puppetry or fanboyism. They also run the ""devio.us"" free shell provider
service which is very impressive.<p>The thing to realize is the people responsible for controlling the
network you are on and enforcing the restrictions probably have a way
out of their own. It could be that their ""day job"" gives them access to
the ""other"" side of their censorship filters, or possibly they've left a
few holes here and there that they can use to by-pass their own
filtering system. If the latter, it's probably done with a VPN of some
sort.<p>In the case of a good commercial service like tunnelr.com, you don't
need to worry too much about figuring out where things were left open.<p>Typically, if UDP traffic is found going to port 53, most people expect
it to be DNS lookups from client systems. Again typically, if TCP
traffic is going to port 53, most people expect it to be DNS lookups
done by DNS servers. Of course, if you see TCP traffic going to port 80,
you'd expect it to be going to a web server...<p>The common expectations are not ""wrong"" in most situations, but these
expectations <i>can</i> be wrong if things are configured differently.<p>In the case of good VPN services, things are configured differently!<p>For example, I can use TCP and connect to port 80 but establish a SSH
connection, or use UDP and connect to port 53 but establish an OpenVPN
connection.<p>This kind of trickery will not fool filters with the capacity to do
""Deep Packet Inspection"" (""DPI"" e.g. protocol profiling), but the vast
majority of filtering tech out there can't do deep packet inspection all
of the time. It requires too much computation to be effective on fully
saturated links, so it slows things down terribly. There are a few
products out there that can do DPI at ""wire-line"" speeds, but they are
hellishly expensive and fairly difficult to manage properly.<p>BTW, if you go the SSH route, check out dsocks by Dug Song. It runs on
most UNIX systems, on MacOS, and on MS-Windows through cygwin.<p>EDIT: I totally forgot about countless the payment options you have 
available in Iran (i.e. none). If that's an issue for you, contact me
privately (email address is in my HN profile).",1328883569

Usually when you use something like EasyXDM, the goal is either to build a site that has different server components located on different domains under your control, or to build a mashup between services explicitly set up to be used for mashups. Theres no data being moved between hosts; were just combining two data sources in one browser window.<p>When you use a Comet server like socket.io, by contrast, the goal instead is to open up a persistent connection between browser and server, so that data can be sent back and forth. Also, FWIW, theres nothing in socket.io or most Comet servers that forces a developer to implement a pub/sub system, as you implied in your first post. [As I said before, sending cross-domain messages between frames, e.g. using EasyXDM, might be part of the inner workings of the browser side of some Comet transports, but thats just an implementation detail, and an application developer would not be expected to touch that code or care about it; its just a black box.]<p>Neither one of these really matches your description, and the two are substantially different from each other.

There are other examples involving dynamic programming, counting sort...which translates nicely to real world use cases, and if you don't know the basic algorithms, you end up re-implementing a second-class substitute badly.",1328883068

I would probably even gladly trade some of my mostly useless algorithmic knowledge for some more practical experience; what good does it do you to understand the finer points of interior point methods?  Even if you have a problem that benefits from their application, in practice you just use an off-the-shelve solver.",1328883058

I used to work in the industry and only reading this do I see how weird it is.<p>We had the MCPS and PRS. One does physical copies of recordings, and the other does performances of a recording.<p>Performing rights are what should be applied here, no copy is being offered, it's simply a broadcast.<p>That being so... why would copyright apply? And if that is the case, then surely all of the fair use doesn't apply because that's related to fair use of copyrights, not performance rights.<p>Example: If I made a video and had the Beatles on as a sound track. Then I need to make sure I have performance rights (usually by a blanket fee), and don't need to consider copyright at all.<p>PRS music fees are covered here: <a href=""http://www.prsformusic.com/users/broadcastandonline/onlinemobile/MusicServices/oml/Pages/onlinemusiclicences.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prsformusic.com/users/broadcastandonline/onlinemo...</a><p>Obviously this all has a UK slant, it's what I know... just curious as to why a similar thing doesn't apply here and it's considered copyright (MCPS equivalent) when no copy is being made.",1328882765

Where complications arise is with bad weather, which can confuse an aircraft's sensors; situations where precision instrument approaches aren't available and, most importantly, other aircraft. There is still not complete certainty that it's safe to fly an autonomous UAV in congested airspace where other other pilots often do unexpected things.<p>Many of these issues can be solved by technical means alone, including the ability to monitor, anticipate and avoid other aircraft. But we're still a very long way from solving that fuzzy boundary when things go wrong and only human judgement can prevent disaster.<p>I also do not believe that aircraft like the X-47B will be given autonomous freedom to select their own targets when they are deployed in about a decade. Instead, while they'll fly autonomously, their targets will be selected by human operators who'll also authorise the release of weapons.<p>True autonomy is going to require the answering of plenty of technical and ethical questions.",1328882524

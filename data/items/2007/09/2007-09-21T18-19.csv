My suggestion is to learn a holistic healing method (Reiki is the simplest of the lot) and use it to heal whoever you feel like helping. I am a Reiki healer/teacher and have seen amazing improvement in people.

She strove to discover general principles that, once grasped, change the way one acts.  Personally, reading and understanding her philosophy has changed my life and the decisions I make a great deal.<p>For anyone interested, I have a site <a href=""http://www.ImportanceOfPhilosophy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ImportanceOfPhilosophy.com</a> that explains why I think philosophy is so important and which is mainly based on Ayn Rand's philosophy.",1190400991

58037,comment,58025,58025,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I skipped philosophy and always regretted it, for the same reasons pg mentions (it seems to be the ultimate in reality)<p>
In the last 3 years, however, I've picked up some great philosophy CDs from The Teaching Company. I spent 400 bucks instead of all that tuition, and I learned enough philosophy to really appreciate it.<p>
I agree somewhat and disagree somewhat with Paul's essay. On one hand, pragmatism seems to be the only rational resposne to so much generalizing! And he's right -- philosopher's have continuously pushed the boundaries of language well past the breaking point.<p>
But I think Paul overgeneralizes, which is ironic since that seems to be part of the claim he's making against philosophy. I view the field as really smart people trying to come to grasp ultimate truths on which the rest of science can be constructed. Many times they have succeede, like J.S. Mills, or Newton. Philosophy generates science.<p>
But you can't take it too seriously. Philosophy is like a dance, or a way to play the tuba. If you're having fun with it, and you're generating something of value (I would agree with the life-changing criteria but simply making a buck from geralizing where nobody else did is enough for me) then you're a philosopher. Anybody who's ever sat designing a program where you get that ""a ha!"" moment, where you realize by generalizing in these few areas you've made a whole new practical and valuable thing, is right up there with Russell in my book. Anybody who has went through requirements sessions, only to have the code still not match the needs because of the slipperiness of language understands Wittgenstein.",1190400470

We boxed it, wrapped it, bundled it up and shipped it to stores, where it was displayed on windows. While many commercial software products still share several of these elements, the high-street software store has all but disappeared. Its place has been taken by an increasingly agile deployment method, first from obscure FTP servers but now revolutionized in scale and convenience by the Web. So why shouldn't books move in the same direction?",1190399064

58022,comment,57933,57933,0,0,jklubnik,,,"I also had a less than ideal experience while playing with Unbox. During setup it asks for your username and password, but does not verify that they are valid. I mistyped one, and as a result it was unable to download the item I had purchased. This wouldn't be a big deal except that there is no way to change your username and password through the software. I finally figured that the only way to change them was to uninstall the software and then install it again. Unfortunately, the uninstaller is not smart enough to kill the Unbox process before attempting to uninstall, so it hangs indefinitely. I had to make sure Unbox was completely dead before the uninstall would work.<p>In short, it took much longer than it should have to purchase and watch a video. And all of my troubles could have been avoided with either a simple verification during setup, or an option to change the password somewhere in the software (this may be missing because of DRM restrictions). <p>The quality of the video was fine, and the download was reasonably fast. The user experience was terrible, as was the UI for the Unbox software. <p>My parents (smart, but not terribly computer savvy) can purchase and enjoy media via iTunes. They would not be able to use Unbox.  ",1190397966

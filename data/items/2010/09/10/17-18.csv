I'm Dan Burkhart, the President of Recurly.<p>There was a very early pricing change, which was admittedly not handled well. We subsequently reached out to all of our customers twice via email surveys, and personally via telephone to all that indicated that they were willing to speak with us. Our latest pricing went over extremely well, AND we did grandfather any customer to prior pricing if they wanted. (A relatively small percentage chose to be grandfathered, since our new pricing has been favorable for the broad majority).<p>You can see that our new pricing posted on July 1 went over extremely well. (There was only one comment on the blog post). <a href=""http://blog.recurly.com/2010/07/new-recurly-pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.recurly.com/2010/07/new-recurly-pricing/</a><p>Our customer base continues to grow rapidly, and since we raised money, we have hired full time customer support. We treat our customers extremely well. I suggest you speak to Retargeter, SlideShare, KissMetrics, Unbounce, WordTracker, SproutSocial, GroupSpaces, GOOD.is, and many others to hear from them how they have been treated, and whether they would recommend Recurly.<p>One last point. Understand that Recurly stores credit cards (in a PCI compliant) vault. The benefit to our customers is 1) that as their business scales, we uniquely offer the ability for our customers to easily transition from one payment gateway to another without ANY business interruption. As your business grows, you will surely be able to negotiate more favorable rates with your gateway, and we give you the leverage to do so. 2) We are also able to better address credit card declines and remediate the process by resubmitting additional information to satisfy the reason for the decline. This results in lower customer churn and for businesses doing any kind of transaction volume, this is a very big benefit.  (Compare Recurly costs to services like Litle & Co who offer the same service for big $$).<p>Cheers.<p>Dan",1284141271

1679582,comment,1679275,1679275,0,0,viae,,,"I disagree that search is the only answer and that Google with get AppStores right first because that is their expertise.  Everyone is on the ""better search"" bandwagon because we want to find quality products faster in an ecosystem of far too many competitors.  That makes immediate sense.  But, a superior retail experience can just as easily solve this problem.<p>The root challenge of app stores is that they break the invisible hand(s) that rule the marketplace, which consumers and retailers all take for granted as an important source of guidance and information.  A market flooded with unlimited supplies of unlimited competitors is a wild west of competition.  This is great.  But, it's also terrible.  As long as supplies of products are unlimited and free to stock because retail space is also limitless there are no motives for the retailer to prune it's shelves of unpopular duplicate products.<p>I think that Apple will continue to allow it's AppStore to grow and for duplicate applications to be produced, but when the competition with Android starts to get fierce they will begin to prune the AppStore of low quality applications.  Non-selling apps, particularly with low ratings, will be cut... and insanely great search that can tell you which fart app of the 30 available is the best one won't be so important anymore because the one fart app that exists in the store will be so great it'll make your eyes water.<p>The trick, of course, is determining how upstarts can compete with more established applications within a problem space.

1679577,comment,1679351,1679452,0,0,strlen,,,"> you'll never be sending your resume ""cold"" again.<p>That's the takeaway. If ten years into your career (baring a situation such as a move to a new area or wanting to work on something completely different from what you're doing now), you're sending in your resume cold to HR you're doing something wrong. You should have made connections in the industry: people who can vouch for you, whom you respect and want to work with. A good resume (with interesting projects as well as companies which do interesting, technically challenging things) <i>can</i> make you a more lucrative target for passive recruiting. However, a resume is a representation of your experience, not the other way around: it gets you in the door, but if you can't pass a technical interview an impressive resume won't save you.<p>Go where you'll be working with the smartest engineers (you <i>can</i> tell that an interview, based on what questions they ask and how they answer your questions) and the work (specific projects you'll be working on) is the most challenging and interesting. If out of all the places you've talked to, the place that meets that criteria is the a startup, go there; if it's a big company (but with serious technical DNA) go there instead. Don't join a startup for the sake of joining a startup, don't join a big company for the brand-name.",1284140904

1679557,comment,1675355,1678535,0,0,dkarl,,,"Apple themselves noted the ubiquity of cases when they downplayed the antenna problem on the iPhone 4, so I'm surprised to hear that there's anywhere in the world where a majority of people don't use them.  Here in the U.S. (Austin, Texas, and I think Texas in general) it's the opposite, 80% in cases or even more.  I almost never see a naked iPhone and can't think of a single person I know who carries one.  I carried my iPhone without a case at first and broke two, personally, before I caved in and started using a case.<p>I didn't think it was controversial that it's an extremely fragile phone.  There's a cottage industry of people who repair broken screens, and there are repair kits available from several different sources for every model of iPhone.  In my experience, if you drop it without a case onto a hard surface, you have about even odds of breaking it.  I don't remember exactly, but my first one broke the second or third time I dropped it.  (I wasn't careful with it at all.)  I was <i>so</i> careful with my second iPhone (which pissed me off in itself that I had to baby a phone that way) and managed to avoid dropping it for months, but the very first time I did, it broke.  My third has been in its case almost constantly since I bought it, but I did drop it without the case once, and it didn't break.  So I had two breaks in four or five hard drops (mostly chest level onto concrete or blacktop,) versus zero breaks in innumerable drops for my previous phones.<p>Just putting a case on it solves the problem completely, but that brings me back to my original point:  if the vast majority of users use it <i>with</i> the case (and that's certainly true here) then it doesn't make any sense to judge it by its size and aesthetics <i>without</i> the case.  Plus, for all the users that resort to a case, Apple did not completely control the phone's aesthetics and user experience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but is certainly noteworthy since it is contrary to conventional wisdom about Apple and the iPhone.<p><i>So why could they not be keeping their phones in a protective case to avoid scratches?</i><p>I can't speak for anyone else, but that doesn't make any sense to me at all.  The case will get scratches, and you'll still have a scratched-up-looking phone.  My case has a rubber ridge around the screen that was apparently munched on by some kind of insect last time I went backpacking.  That's just the way things get when you use them.  If people want a pristine-looking phone, they'll have to buy a new case every few months.<p>In general, I see almost all iPhone owners using cases, and with other cell phones, I see a clear minority using cases, mostly girls with decorative cases or (like you mentioned) IT geeks who like to clip them to their utility belts.  From that I conclude that most iPhone users who keep their iPhone in a case would not do so if they had a different phone, and would prefer not to use a case with their iPhone, but feel compelled to do so for practical reasons.",1284140605

1679538,comment,1679409,1679409,0,0,p_alexander,,,"I worked full-time as a Drupal developer for two years and still dabble with it, though I'm now using Rails as my main web ui development technology. Though I'm not as connected to the community now, I've always been impressed with the level of participation that the community has, the outstanding volume of the work being done, and the commitment (for the most part) to the ""Drupal Way"".<p>I haven't heard of any major incidents of compromise, though it is easy to let sites get out of date which would leave some holes open.<p>As for MySQL, I think there are plenty of examples of it working at massive scale with good security (inside the Drupal community and out). From what I've seen developers seem pretty committed to working with other databases, though I'm not sure how far beyond MySQL and Postgres you'll get.<p>As for the ""effective as an MVC question"": no. Looking at that chart, half of the items mentioned in the Controller and Model you aren't supposed to edit regularly (parts of the Drupal Core), and especially not for site-specific functionality. Sure, most things can be altered with the addition of modules, but you're eventually going to run across something that can't be easily overridden from a module, or a place where there's no hook, or you just fundamentally disagree with how something works.<p>The modules themselves can be just as frustrating. Sometimes you'll encounter a situation where a module gets you 95% of the way there, but again you'll need to make some alterations and you have to understand exactly how the module works in order to do this. That means delving into someone else's code, the quality of which can vary considerably.<p>Finally, Drupal isn't REALLY object oriented. It's not as if content types are represented as a model with a corresponding controller, which is how I would expect MVC to work. A lot of individual pieces of code are OOP, but the entire system wasn't designed with this in mind.<p>That's not to say that Drupal doesn't have its uses. If you are fine with the default that's provided or feel like getting 95% of the way there in some cases is good enough, then by all means fire up a Drupal site. Unfortunately, you need to be familiar with the options out there in order to easily make the decision up front.<p>On the plus side, it's nice having a user system with permissions, administration, easy ways to add content, pretty good methods for handling audio, images, etc all up-front without having to do any coding. This is where Drupal shines, in my opinion. It's great for enabling technical people who can't/don't code to set up complicated systems. But that's a far cry from being an effective MVC.<p>If you do use Drupal, definitely use Drush (<a href=""http://drupal.org/project/drush"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/project/drush</a>).",1284140299

The punchline of the experiment was that a full class of approximately-average grade-schoolers were taught math in a novel method, and developed their own multiplication algorithms, and went on to have above-average improvements in math test scores. The development of those algorithms were probably guided to a certain extent, but they looked to me like someone who was working the problem out from the first principles based on the concept of place value. That said, I'm definitely willing to accept the evidence you claim to have (especially since it leaves open the meaning of ""<i>correct</i>"").<p>I definitely agree that education should be based on science and not on dogma. Just because we think something ought to work doesn't mean that it works (it usually doesn't), and education is something you don't want to fuck up because the stakes are high and you only get one chance. But, I'm not sure we're even at the point where we can do research yet. Before you can measure results, you need to decide what results you're looking for and how you're measuring them.<p>I'm a mathematician, and I'll be the first to admit that being able to perform long-multiplication isn't actually that useful of a skill, and yet that's mostly what we measure on standardized tests. Understanding what multiplication means and being generally numerate is far more useful and not measured very often (the best we have is word problems). The more desirable side-effects, such as the ability to abstract concepts, to generalize processes, and to apply knowledge from one domain to another, aren't being measured at all, and those are really the only things from my math education that I use in my day-to-day life. Similar things happen across other subjects--knowing what year the War of 1812 happened in isn't useful, while understanding the social, economic, and political conditions that led to that war is useful for the average citizen in a democracy (but doesn't fit well in a scantron).<p>I think we as a society need to first have a big sit-down and figure out what the point of education is. We know it's important, but we've never coherently stated particularly why, and that lack of explicit direction is what lets politics, dogma, and fads more easily take control of the process. Once we've done that, we can let science guide the structure of education. Or rather, we should. There's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem that without solid backgrounds in quantitative and logical thinking, most people have difficulty making data-driven decisions, and people in general won't get better at that until the education system improves.",1284139662

I read left-to-right, so I usually start multiplying with the leftmost digits and track the zeros, then add things up until I've reached the desired accuracy. Really, it's just the traditional method in reverse -- this 10-slide explanation is <i>much</i> easier for teaching the basic concept of multiplication, though.<p>- Chunking is division explained as ""how many portions does this make"" rather than the traditional problem of ""how big would each of these equal-sized portions?"" -- which is great for two reasons: (1) physically performing the alternative -- measuring out a fluid into N equal-sized portions -- is hard! (2) it's more like how computers work, and makes the modulo operation trivial to explain; this kind of quotient clearly ignores the issue of remainders in the initial problem, and then later it's clear what you can do with the remainder to make a compound fraction.<p>But it's unfortunate that memorization has become taboo in Western education. Sometimes you actually <i>need</i> to memorize a table of facts and be able to recall them quickly, as with single-digit multiplication -- if you have to add up seven eights each time you encounter 7x8, you'll just be too slow to keep up.

A phone can run Android without using any Google services, or running any third-party Android apps. This will become more common as Android becomes more popular on low-end devices, as this article predicts. If a phone doesn't run Google services, then it's not generating any more revenue for Google than a non-Android smartphone. If it's not running third-party apps, then it's not relevant for developers deciding which system to invest in.<p>On desktop systems, we have a clear idea of what market share means. A higher Windows market share means more revenue for Microsoft, and a better return for their investors. It also means a larger market for third party developers.

Did we succeed or fail? Is it too early to tell? Right now we are asking ourselves in what direction we should take our business, if any at all.<p>The idea for the product was simply born out of my own frustration of loosing my music collection in a hard drive crash and my nerdy need for having a neat and nicely cataloged and index music collection. We didn't set out to create the most original product or to revolutionize anything. We simply wanted to create a good product that did something mildly useful and that could attract a lucrative niche of users (record collectors). But it's not like there is no competition in the music player market, rather the contrary. With competition from products like Spotify and Grooveshark that offer on demand streaming from a wast library of licensed music -- something we would never be able to offer -- its hard to make yourself heard in the marketplace.<p>So the question really is: We think we have created a useful and well executed product.

The difference between options and stock is largely a tax matter. In both cases, you've received an instrument with a very low current price that will be lucrative to you if the price appreciates (in, for instance, a takeover).<p>When you leave the company, you'll be required to shell out some cash to keep your exposure to the company's upside; you didn't give numbers, but if you stay until you're mostly vested, expect it to cost a couple thousand dollars. You'll have to decide whether the company's prospects merit the investment.<p>If the company is sold before you leave, you won't have to exercise your options in advance (you'll still need to exercise them, but this will be a no-brainer since the stock value will have appreciated). The difference between leaving and staying with respect to your options is risk.<p>As with every company, your options vest, meaning they become available to you in waves on a vesting schedule. This should not concern you; even the founders in your company have a vesting schedule.<p>What happens when the company is purchased? It depends. If you're lucky, there is a company-wide change-of-control clause that gets you instant access to the upside of the sale. You're probably not that lucky. The most likely outcome is that you'll have a mostly locked-in upside, but that you'll have to work through the remainder of your vesting schedule to get it. There are lots of sticky details (such as what happens if you're terminated before you vest after a change of control), but it's a waste of time to worry about them now.<p>You didn't ask, but do know: as employee 50+N in a 100+K-person startup, you are extremely unlikely to get any concessions in the terms and conditions of your equity grant. The company's board reviewed and agreed on this plan; it is a big deal to change it for anyone.<p>The real question is the company valuation and its financing terms. You should have been informed as to what % of the common stock your grant works out to, so you can work out what an $Xmm acquisition means to you. You should also probably be able to find out what the liquidation terms are on the company's financing (how much of that X the company's investors take off the top before the common stock is valued). These are the numbers that differ most wildly from job to job, and the ones most likely to impact your personal upside.<p>Remember that as a line employee in a 100 person startup, your stock grant is not going to be a life-changing event unless the company is CNN-level spectacularly successful. If the company does quite well, it'll probably amount to the equivalent of a 5-figure bonus per year, paid in a lump sum when the company is bought.",1284138429

Granted, 10 years from now he will probably make more than I will because he works ridiculously harder than I do.</i><p>You assume that because you have the same job and sit next to each other that you make the same amount of money.  In my experience that is a very unsafe assumption.  Unless you know what he makes, you don't know that.  (In most US companies, talking about what you make to co-workers is a fireable offense for a reason.)",1284138338

4284,comment,4283,4283,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Sounds like a great story, but what's really going on here? Surely there's a side that isn't presented. Everyone in the comments is talking about how evil the VC firm is, but the outcome wasn't exactly great for them, either. Their interests should be at least loosely coupled with those of the founders (different risk/return rate preferences for sure, but that doesn't make shutting down promising companies profitable). It's not like they screwed the founders over and made a tidy profit, from the figures available it was more like stemming the bleeding of a cash hungry company that wasn't really going anywhere.<p>So if what they did is evil, what was their motivation? Killing FilmLoop to increase the other companies chance of success? Bumping up their fund statistics by trying to call it a liquidity event? Either could explain the short deadline for liquidation, which otherwise doesn't really make sense. Anyone know more about this?",1173922748

4282,comment,4281,4281,0,0,pg,,,"Maybe it's time I finally explained the math of taking investment.  You should give up n% of your company iff (not a typo) what you'll get in return for it will increase the value of the remaining (100 - n)% enough to put you net ahead.<p>So in the case of YC, you should trade us 6% of your co if you think that the money plus whatever else we add will increase your average outcome by 7%.  (.94 x 1.07 > 1)  Do we increase the average outcome of the startups we fund by 7%?  I think few would say we didn't.  I'd guess we at least double the outcome for the average startup.",1173922310

4279,comment,4235,4235,0,0,zaidf,,,"In the last week of 2006 and couple weeks before the launch of our site, I had what I thought was a great idea(thankyou2006.com). I shared the idea with my partner, he liked it, we worked on it for a day and launched it.<p>I had to break my own promise to not work on anything else. And it made me a little nervous that this might cause the distraction we didn't need few weeks before our launch. <p>Keys:<p>1. Know your and your team's limits from past experience. What has happened in past when you worked on side projects? <p>2. Find some angle where the side project has the potential to compliment your primary company. In our case, if the side project it would have given us some much-needed $$$s for our main start-up.<p>--Zaid",1173921029
4278,comment,4200,4266,0,0,python_kiss,,,"It depends on how you use this site. You might've noticed how the top users tend to post articles and spark interesting discussions while new users tend to post news. As a startup founder, you are more interested in analytical articles rather than news. For news, you might be better off subscribing to other sites for a larger scope (i.e. TechCrunch, Mashable, GigaOm, and KillerStartups). There is no shortage of news.<p>Good analytical articles, however, require that users swipe through their rss feeds, find an interesting piece, and post it here. The value of yc.news, in my opinion, is in the articles that other startup founders find interesting. And that alone makes this place worth your time.",1173920773

They may be taking it for granted and not even feeling it anymore. But if you just start scratching/massaging _somewhere_, you'll get useful ""more to the left, no, a bit more up- THERE- AAaaaahh!"" feedback. If you're so out of touch that they will push you away rather than steer you into the right spots, well, that's useful info too.<p>I don't imagine that feedback will be coming easy unless there's the prospect of an almost immediate solution (I'm less likely to discuss back itches on the phone). Your idea, as I understand it, offers a slim chance that each specific problem will be addressed, and even in that case the solution is months away.<p>Filtering people out isn't necessarily bad. This may help in identifying problems that hurt a lot. What you probably want, though, is problems that hurt lots of people.<p>Having something like what you propose would be better than not having it, and I don't want to discourage you from the idea. Just don't expect it to replace ""trying to guess what many people would want.""",1173920603

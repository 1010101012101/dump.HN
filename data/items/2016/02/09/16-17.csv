The original title, &quot;Safer Internet Day: Young ignore &#x27;social media age limit&#x27;&quot;, at least focuses partially on the actual topic of the article, an event meant to raise awareness of online bullying. A better title edit would be &quot;10-12 year olds report seeing, experiencing online bullying in spite of social media age limits&quot;.<p>But, you know what else puts youth at risk for bullying? Going outside. Going to school. Being different. Liking things other kids don&#x27;t like. Being gay. Being black. Being asian. Etc..<p>Random trolls on the internet can do orders of magnitude less psychological damage to a kid than their actual peers can by excluding them from activities in the real world and making the state-mandated 9-5 they go to an experience they dread.<p>This sort of dominance behavior is likely a human evolutionary constant, but so are a lot of behaviors we&#x27;ve as a society decided are no longer acceptable. What will actually stop bullying is enforcing, across society and consistently in front of children, that it isn&#x27;t acceptable to hurt other people to benefit yourself.<p>I&#x27;m sure virtually every educator knows this, because they&#x27;re usually trained in child psychology.

What I guess I haven&#x27;t made clear is that any rational extension of classical physics would presume the clock rates would be different. Bear in mind that Lorentz&#x27;s Aether theory was ultimately classical in nature because even though he had the Lorentz transform and all the time effects, light speed constancy was modeled as an illusion within a preferred frame.<p>IE from a purely newtonian perspective, there is a &quot;catching up&quot; that light would have to play in a moving apparatus such as an atomic clock. This naturally lends itself to time dilation from motion. Furthermore Newtonian mechanics also predicted deviation of starlight and therefore gravitational time dilation of exactly one half that predicted by Relativity. Einstein mentions it in his book &quot;Relativity&quot;.<p>So what I&#x27;m talking about is a little more nuanced than it seems.

11066646,comment,11060232,11064735,0,0,rchowe,,,"I agree that it is way too difficult to manage a bunch of monthly subscriptions, and also that having to put my credit card information into a website (and have it bill me every month) is basically as bad if not worse as putting up with the advertisements on a website. However, I think that micropayments/a flattr-style fund for reading articles is doomed to fail because of the psychological shift between &quot;I&#x27;m reading this article for free&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m reading this article for $0.01, I only have 1000 of these left this month, maybe this isn&#x27;t the one I really want to spend this on.&quot; My opinion is that a Spotify/Netflix-style subscription model is the best: collect subscription money, then pay per-user that accesses an article. However, the issue with this model is that the &quot;network&quot; of things that you are allowed to read will be really small at first.<p>That said, here is my proposed business model. Create an app that allows users to load money into the app monthly and issues each user a unique credit card number[1] for subscriptions to other websites, giving a central location to manage subscriptions. Once you build up a number of users on a single site, go to that site and say &quot;Hey, you can save the 1% of the subscription cost from our users that&#x27;s eaten up by credit card fees[2] by going through us to manage subscriptions. Oh, and it will also increase your conversion rate among our users since it will only take two clicks to subscribe instead of having to enter a bunch of credit card information. Once you have a critical mass, you go around to companies and now create the Netflix-style subscription service. If you&#x27;re clever, you probably can create article-level bundles, e.g. &quot;every article in our network that was linked to off of Hacker News,&quot; but NOW you have the pay-to-read subscription with a critical mass of information that people want to read, instead of &quot;we&#x27;re launching with these twenty sites from these four companies and we hope to add more.&quot;<p>[1] Yes, there are a bunch of problems with issuing credit card numbers. Yes, I know I complained about having to enter credit card numbers in the first paragraph. This is a big picture thing.<p>[2] This is kind of wrong, since a credit card fee will be charged to load money into the app, as well as for disbursements. At this point, the startup would probably have to eat that fee or heavily push ACH/lower fee methods of payment (even though I hate companies that push ACH for this reason).",1455036775

The templates are inconsistent and arbitrary, and convey no information to the reader. You have fantastical gibberish like vin/reen/camon, standard anglo names like dockson/hammond, bizarre nicknamey nouns like breeze/clubs/spook, and cod-french like valette renoux.

It&#x27;s not about economic theories. It&#x27;s about practicalities. It is increasingly hard to tax the wealthy and large corporations.  This is for reasons that are not easy to remedy, and may not be remediable. The reality in all developed countries is that (1) total budget/gdp is %35 - %45 and (2) the middle class pay disproportionately high taxes. This is effectively what you are working with as a leader in a 2016 developed country.<p>If you think you can get significantly more (ie percentage points of GPD) out of the wealthy... well... that&#x27;s the significant part.

The point of taxation is not to maximize government revenue -- if the government wants to maximize revenue it could just print dollar bills. The point is to maximize purchasing power. Thus the downside of high taxes is not manifested in lower government revenue in dollar terms. It is manifested in fewer startups and fewer risky investments, and thus fewer new technologies and new products. Overly high taxes change the equation for risk taking -- why try to start a business when if you succeed, you won&#x27;t keep that much of the winnings? If fewer people start businesses, the economy becomes more sclerotic as big corporations no longer have to face competition from upstarts.<p>The problem is that it is fundamentally impossible to quantitatively measure the impact of taxes on startups and economic dynamism. We know that if we taxed at 100%, we would likely have very few startups. But we do not know how much any given incremental change will hurt the economy. But as rough estimate, if the current tax rate is ~33%, and a tax rate of 100% would kill all startups, then a tax of 73% (the max rate proposed by Saez) would kill about half of startups (or rather, mean that they never exist. Immigrant founders would choose to start companies elsewhere, other founders would sell out early to a big company, and the big company would then just ruin the product like they normally do, etc.) Very roughly, such a tax rate might raise around an additional $100 billion. Would increasing total government revenue by 2% be worth killing half of all startups? That doesn&#x27;t sound like a good trade to me. (Of course I am personally biased on this issue).",1455036151

My wife frequently answers the political poll questions when people call, in part because she feels sorry for the poller.  Answering those calls can take 15-30 minutes.  So you&#x27;re depending on the results of people who have 15-30 minutes to answer 35 questions about the government.  I feel like there&#x27;s a selection bias at work there already, and you&#x27;re assuming that people will give thoughtful answers to the questions, that the order of questions doesn&#x27;t affect responses, etc, etc, etc.  You&#x27;re depending on 1018 people who actually may not be statistically relevant, since America is a big, big country, to drive your thinking on that country.<p>Plus, would the responses to the surveys be different if the word &#x27;disappointed&#x27; was used instead of angry?

Fencing ensures that if the network does reorder writes, one of them fails.<p>The lock is acting sort of like a clock that ticks whenever it hands out a lease.

You send increments and decrements and settle up at the end.  Yes, your balance might go negative, but that&#x27;s what ATM limits are for -- the most you could go negative is that limit.

It&#x27;s little things, like going through how the quadratic formula is derived instead of just telling someone to learn it by rote.  Explaining differentiation with a bit of the logic behind it instead of just teaching rules.<p>But at the same time - I know I&#x27;d have/did enjoy that stuff but maybe 60% of my classes would have played up if a whole lesson was spent deriving and exploring concepts without rote learning.<p>Being a maths teacher has to be pretty rough, especially given the number of students who are openly hostile to it as a subject.<p>As an aside, I often think about my Religious Studies teacher who&#x27;d disparage topics like Maths as being irrelevant after school.  We&#x27;d never use them she said.  RS was vital to life success, Maths a pointless exercise.  <i>It still winds me up to remember</i>.",1455033674

After legalization in CO, public smoking went <i>way</i> up.<p>I suspect it&#x27;ll drop down again after the novelty wears off and the public tires of it and wants smoking laws enforced.<p>But one nice perk of legalization is that it could be written into leases explicitly that smoking in the apartment is in violation of the lease and is grounds for eviction after repeated complaints.  It&#x27;s not a police matter or a &quot;narcotics&quot; issue, it&#x27;s just somebody being an inconsiderate neighbor.",1455033605

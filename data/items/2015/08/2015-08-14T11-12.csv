But we also have to acknowledge that we as a profession are not able to write secure code in C/C++. We&#x27;re talking about classes of security bugs that just don&#x27;t exist in managed languages. Bugs that can&#x27;t happen in languages like Rust either because it forces programmers to indicate ownership and lifetime of memory.<p>There&#x27;s always a trade-off between performance and security, but with better tooling support the price for secure code will be very low. Right now security is bad because we look at security as a feature. As something that is added to a project, instead of as something that guides the entire design.<p>Your suggestion that static analysis can fix this is wildly optimistic, because C/C++ code for a modern browser uses memory pools, pointer arithmetic, just-in-time compilation, and shared memory between object instances, threads and processes and so on. It&#x27;s hugely complex, and correctness can&#x27;t be verified with some sort of static analyzer or with added runtime checks.",1439553266

Other will tell you it&#x27;s nice. They are all expressing their opinion and it has as much value as yours. Once you start collecting a lot of feedback you can maybe start to think that your opinion being only in a minority might not be the best choice.<p>There are extremes in everything and also some people give strong negative feedback because they want to see an improvement, some give good feedback because they don&#x27;t want to make you feel bad.

You can apply at - <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/nc9okjm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/nc9okjm</a><p>Telenor Digital is aiming to create a world-class login solution with the goal of connecting tens of millions of users (we just reached our first million!) to different services within the next two years. When developing we focus on mobile-first and progressive enhancement, and we strive to offer an enjoyable experience to all our users, regardless of what device and platform they are using. We operate mainly in the European and the Asian markets, with all the challenges that include, for example: different alphabets, different levels of literacy among our users, and different experience levels with internet usage and technology.<p>Our implementation 
We use Java a lot. As we are creating login, user-management, and payment applications, we use HTML forms a lot too. Our older applications are built with Jersey/JAX-RS (<a href=""https://jersey.java.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jersey.java.net/</a>), while our new ones are built with Spark (<a href=""http://sparkjava.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparkjava.com/</a>). We try to keep the code-base to a minimum. On the frontend we use plain JavaScript (inline) for code that has to be executed right away, and jQuery for “nice to have” functionality. We use Apache Velocity for templating. We build using Maven and Grunt, and we track our code using Git. Performance is key, and our aim is that our applications should be ready to use (or at least be perceived as being ready to use) within a second, even on slow connections. 
We have (big) databases too, but you won’t have to interact with them directly. Persistence is handled by an API created by another team.<p>Who we are looking for 
We need more hands on Java/Web. This means we need someone who would be comfortable with working with Java, Jersey, Spark, Apache Velocity and JavaScript/jQuery. And Maven/Grunt for building. We are not looking for someone who is already an expert on all of these things (It would be nice, though), but someone who knows a few and is willing and able to learn the rest.<p>Deadline for application:30/08/2015<p>Contact info: Tina Tan  (+47) 90894741",1439552448

According to this, the answer is <i>yes</i>.  So a retail Windows 10 license (which is what you get if you upgrade a retail copy of Windows 7 or 8) is apparently good not just for the life of the device, but for future devices as well.  (One at a time, obviously.)<p>If true, the retail copies sound like a good deal.  Especially while you can buy a retail copy of Windows 7 and upgrade it.",1439550993

I don&#x27;t know what the risk for a visitor is in reality. These cases seem to happen out of nowhere. I don&#x27;t have any reason to be arrested, really, and I&#x27;ll probably be fine absolutely most of the time but if something should happen and I happened to be around I&#x27;m, as a foreigner, in a very weak position to understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>I should probably read a couple of books on US legal system and how things work there but the need for doing so would usually arise from having to travel to some totalitarian developing country. In certain countries, you should expect to have some money as it might be customary to bribe the police officer or other officials but once that&#x27;s settled things generally unfold fine from there. It seems that in the US, you should expect to have lots of money as it might be customary to bribe the court yet things can generally get quite uncertain from there, based on what I&#x27;ve read. It&#x27;s hard to evaluate the risk, though: the probability is rather low but the impact can be devastating.<p>I get the feeling that if only you&#x27;re a &quot;regular Joe&quot;, ideally white (or fit in the &quot;good&quot; ethnicity of your city), you don&#x27;t stand out of others, and you have money, you&#x27;re likely to be fine.

They don&#x27;t control the Erlang ecosystem, and they have learned the hard way how that fares (Java+Oracle+Android).<p>The other problem is that Google needs to build tooling that fits into their existing code base. In this case Java, C++, Python, Javascript and so on. They had to build everything from scratch anyway for Go or Erlang had they chosen either.<p>A lot of the nice things Erlang provide is already in place in the Google infrastructure. So you are aiming at small services which are isolated. This is a place Go has an easy way of getting going.<p>Of course, language familiarity also plays a large role. Go is pretty easy to onboard if you have decent Java or C++ knowledge. Erlang requires you to rethink the way you handle computation. Granted, the long-term benefits in productivity you gain in Erlang is significant[0], but adding more developers to a project is easy for Google.<p>[0] Whenever I write Go, I get frustrated at how much I have to write to do even the basic data munging.

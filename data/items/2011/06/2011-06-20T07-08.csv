2673246,comment,2668906,2668906,3,0,robflynn,,,"I think I have been in your shoes.  I got lucky at a young age and semi-made a name for myself.<p>I started working on an open source project when I was around 17 years old.  By the time I was 18 or 19, the project was gaining in popularity. I got a great job right out of high school and moved to California.  There were several times when I actually overheard random people talking about my project in public. That was cool.<p>As time went on, I moved on to different job due to various circumstances (none the fault of myself, but of the market.)<p>11 years or so have now passed and I am finishing up a few years of contract work/freelancing. Money was good for a while but the contracts dried up when the economy took a turn. I'm a smart dude, but I was never good at marketing myself.<p>I went through a year of depression where I stopped looking for work and couldn't convince myself that I was worth anything.<p>It took damn near that entire year to convince myself that I was still the same bright dude that did all of these things. I don't say this to be boastful, but instead to say that you are still that same person that accomplished whatever it is that you did.<p>It took a long, hard year for me to realize that. Once I came to that realization, my depression began to fade. I am now fighting and clawing to put myself back out in the world.<p>I've started up a couple start-up ideas (once is a very small niche that should launch in the next couple weeks, basically just waiting on the financial bits to fall into place.), and the other I hope to have up and going a couple months after.<p>I am actively submitting resumes now. I did not hear back from a couple of the companies to which I submitted my resume.  I don't feel phased by that anymore. I know that I can/will be valuable to a company and if some company does not see that then some other company will.<p>I honestly can not say what helped me overcome my issues. I had friend constantly telling me encouraging thoughts, saying wonderful things to me, but I didn't believe it. I was simply in a dark place.  As I think about it now, however, the best I can do for putting a finger on my solution was:
  * I started exercising again. It does a lot, not only for your physical health, but for your mental health
  * I quit smoking. It makes you sluggish.
  * Limit your drinking for the same reason. 
  * I started working on side projects that excited me.<p>Now that excitement that I had when I was a fresh lad at 19 years old feels reborn, only now I am 30 years old and ready to take on the world all over again, cheesy as it may sound.<p>I don't let the accomplishments of others get me down. I have decided, instead, to let them inspire. Did someone do something you want to do? Well, damnit, do it better!<p>I apologize if this is rambling, I'm just kind of going stream of consciousness from the heart.<p>Best of luck to you.",1308554440
2673244,story,,,1,2,Lucadg,"Help with Ratings feature: how to limit spam? ",,"Hi all,
I run an online accommodation reservation builder and I am going to add ratings now.
Until two weeks ago I was quite confident that I could avoid spammers by limiting rating privileges to guests who paid through the system to reserve.
That will avoid all the fake reviews TripAdvisor gets.
But now, after 10 days in Vietnam I am afraid that's not enough.
What happens here is:
- Hotel Manager reserves its own room for one night for a Ghost Guest.
- Ghost Guest comes, sleeps and leaves (nobody comes actually of course)
- Hotel Manager leaves a great review.
Cost of the great review? A few U$, the commission paid to the online reservation system.
That's a great deal as it WILL bring many customers.<p>I am really sure this happens because I stayed in hotels via Agoda.com which were ""fantastic"", ""best breakfast ever"", ""best hotel in Asia"" and BS like that.
The hotels were fine, but the ratings unreal.<p>So, one idea I have is to give a weight to each rating, proportional to the number of nights, giving a particular low value to the ones for 1 night stays, which are probably 99% of fakes ones.<p>Do you have suggestions?<p>thank you in advance!<p>Luca",1308554376

They've never appeared to have a clue about security, and performance has been a complete and utter mess for quite a while now.  To give you some idea, the trade that blew through the entire buy-side took over 30 minutes to execute, and the exchange essentially slowed to a standstill during that time. I realize that there are a lot of orders on any exchange at any moment, but 30 minutes of downtime in response to a single order?

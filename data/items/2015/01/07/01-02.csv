Look how unassailable the Apple and Android are now -- you can&#x27;t get a foothold at the bottom of the market because it&#x27;s hugely fragmented and there are no profit margins, while at the top of the market you&#x27;re taking on beloved brands and have to try crazy over-the-top bets to get in the door -- which usually backfire.<p>Android could have been the Fire Phone of its day.  The earliest Android phones were just amazingly bad compared to the iPhone.  But iPhones were only available on AT&T.  Do you live in an area where AT&T had no service?  Your only choice was an Android.  iPhones insisted for years on having exactly one clearly unpopular screen size.  Want a 4&quot; screen?  Your only choice was an Android.  Apple refused to develop a downmarket phone.  Want something less than a flagship?  Your only choice was an Android.<p>That window has closed.  iOS has finally filled in all the places it used to suck (well, maybe except for developing an economical model, but last year&#x27;s phone looks better now than it used to, and in any case Android filled that niche to the overflowing).",1420594626

Or experiment with various pinentry utilities, see what works for you; there should be a pinentry somewhere on your system after you install gnupg, and usually it&#x27;s text-mode.<p>The value shown above is for OS X with GPG Tools, which is a GUI mode pinentry. If you install gnupg via Homebrew, read what I said above about Linux. Or google for the GUI mode pinentry for OS X - it&#x27;s a separate download, made from an older GPG Tools version, that you can install along with Homebrew gnupg.<p><pre><code>  $ tail -n 7 .bash_profile \n  GPG_TTY=$(tty)\n  export GPG_TTY\n  if [ -f &quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; ]; then\n	. &quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot;\n	export GPG_AGENT_INFO\n	export SSH_AUTH_SOCK\n  fi\n</code></pre>\nThe GPG_TTY is not needed with the GUI pinentry that comes with GPG Tools on OS X, but might be needed for the simpler text-mode pinentries that come with other gnupg distros.<p>On Linux, or on Mac with gnupg installed from Homebrew, you need to launch gpg-agent upon logging in (GPG Tools will do that automatically for you). One way that seems to work well (checked with Homebrew gnupg on OS X, and with the Linux gnupg) is to add this to .bash_profile:<p><pre><code>  eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)\n</code></pre>\nTo use it, put your public key on a server, plug the NEO into USB, and run &#x27;ssh user@host&#x27;. pinentry will ask you for the user PIN.

8848282,comment,8845507,8847335,0,0,dxbydt,,,">There&#x27;s a hatred of mathematics in mainstream American culture that runs very, very deep<p>Completely agreed. As an immigrant, I can say it is very much a US thing. Haven&#x27;t seen this much math-hate, but more importantly, math-utilitarianism, as in the US. In Asian countries & in Europe ( UK, France especially), people don&#x27;t constantly fixate on stupid questions like &quot;what is it good for ? &quot;, which is ultimately a proxy for &quot;how do I make money with this thing ?&quot;. But when I taught math here in the US as a graduate student TA, the majority of questions focussed on this single metric - usefulness.<p>So math texts here are forced to invent bogus problems like &quot;You want to house pigs with 500 feet of fencing. What dimensions of your rectangular pen will house the most hogs ?&quot;. Then the American kid says, Ah! Now I see the point of all this! Let l be the length of my pen and b its breadth. You want me to maximize the area of my pen l<i>b subject to 2l+2b=500 so I can house the most pigs! Ok so I see that b = 250-l, so l</i>b is 250l - l^2, so I take its derivative & equate to zero & l=125, b=125, and that&#x27;s the biggest pen that can house the most pigs. Very nice!<p>In other countries, you simple wouldn&#x27;t come up with all these sort of bogus utilitarian problems in animal husbandry. Students here learn exponentials & Taylor expansion as part of &quot;how do I compute compound interest on my bank account&quot;, because that&#x27;s supposedly the only legitimate use of e^x !<p>I honestly found teaching pre-calc, calc-1 & calc-2 a complete travesty, because the theorems & the entire courseware was essentially perverted - it was all in service of how to make use of the math for some bogus application, rather than learn it for its own good. The worst was when I had to teach how the horizontal range of parabolic trajectories varied - the textbook had examples of the US bombing Japan, & the students went to work computing the best possible angle for firing the missile, so that it would fly across in a parabolic trajectory and land the farthest thus maximizing its horizontal range & kill the most number of Japanese! There was no thought given to how violent & nasty this was.<p>I actually have very radical ideas about how things should be taught - like you must learn Rolle&#x27;s theorem before learning shit like pre-calc. Learn as much of undergrad real analysis before you get into application oriented shit like calc-1, calc-2 etc. Don&#x27;t bring in garbage like LCR circuitry into pde&#x27;s, even though yes, you can use a third order differential equation to compute current through an LCR circuit.<p>Applications have their place, but such an overemphasis on application is simply not healthy. It actively distorts the culture & the body politic. Note that American students don&#x27;r ask &quot;what use is rock and roll ? otr what use is hbo ? or what use is literature ?&quot; all those things are given a free pass. But when it comes to math, suddenly use becomes the primary criterion. Read pages 6-7, & especially 12 of Lockhart&#x27;s lament, where he chooses to parody this point of view via Simplicio.",1420593714

The approach I took was to use a multiresolution &quot;mipmap&quot; like representation of the data. When animating, lower details were chosen, and the system would bound the max number of points to draw that would achieve a given FPS, and choose the detail level dynamically.<p>I also offered a commercially supported version at the time, Timescope, other types of charts. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYNHQVIeNg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYNHQVIeNg</a> as well as a version that had a social sharing system with 2-way synchronization &quot;micropresentations&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYNHQVIeNg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYNHQVIeNg</a>)<p>Micropresentations allowed you to &quot;script&quot; the chart via a markdown-like/Wiki like text annotation in comments. This means when you were debating or responding to some chart, you could move the chart around, add empheral markers, or other call outs, even video, in order to make your point.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYNHQVIeNg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYNHQVIeNg</a><p>The old code is <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/gwt-chronoscope/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/gwt-chronoscope/</a> if anyone is interested.",1420592715

Maybe it comes from all those hours in the Sun Lab.<p>I like most of your predictions, but I think you&#x27;re at least half-wrong on the cryptocurrency side; the blockchain is real innovation. Do you guys <i>know</i> at Joyent that your data hasn&#x27;t been modified, deleted, lost or added to and when? I bet you don&#x27;t. The amount of data risk any modern company takes on is almost criminal, just like you refer to in your security predictions. The blockchain technologies let you solve that problem, among many others.<p>I&#x27;m not predicting a brilliant year for Bitcoin; I think there&#x27;s a lot of building to be done on the currency side especially, but I just don&#x27;t see the case for sniping at it too much, especially while transaction rates stay well in excess of $10mmUSD / day in the middle of falling prices. I&#x27;m going to predict some notable traction in smaller non-libertarian markets for Bitcoin by the end of 2015 in return. :)",1420592672

The desire was a small flagship phone, you&#x27;ll be disappointed at anything with less quality.<p>I can recommend the Moto G, it too is a flagship phone at a much too low price, they recently introduced a 2nd gen but it&#x27;s more expensive. You can get the original second hand for around €100, I am certain it won&#x27;t disappoint.",1420592458

The problem is being able to recreate the state: both for testing and for business purposes.<p>The bigger problem is that most programmers, like you, are knee-jerking before the issue of ""recreating the state"" and declaring that <i>""It cannot be done, because it's all state""</i>.<p>And hence we have both languages who are build by considering mutability to be a virtue and back-end databases (your typical CRUD SQL DB) build upon the same false premises.<p>I'll give you one example: monday morning the service desk calls because one user of your app, at 3:07pm on friday, experienced a bug.<p>Can you ""recreate the state"" your application was in at that time as to be able to figure out what triggered the bug?<p>You probably can't.  Because your DB has changed meanwhile: you're SOL because the 'U' and the 'D' in CRUD are destructive.  It's mutability.  It's the ennemy of determinism.<p>So now you're stuck calling your DB admin asking for a dump of the prod DB on last thursday evening and a dump of the log of the transactions that happened on friday... And you're spending hours and hours trying to recreate the state the environment was in when the sh<i>t hit the fan.  And you may or may not be able to do it.<p>It's just one hypotethical scenario but things like that is the daily lot of </i>many* programmers.<p>But software development, in many cases, shouldn't be that painful.  If you were to use a CRA DB (Create Read Append) and languages favoring immutability and a more functional approach overall, you'd have a much much easier time recreating the state.<p>If you think of it, it's all a gigantic determistic machine.<p>So why can't we accept that the notion of time is an important one?<p>Why can't you realize that the battle the likes of Rich Hickey are fighting are worth it?<p>It <i>is</i> possible to use programming languages and DBs (or wrappers like Datomic in front of SQL DBs) that do definitely make it easier to reason about programs and that make it just so much easier to recreate the state <i>and</i> to query the past (which has a lot of business value).<p>Why do you react like this: <i>""The truth is, it's all state""</i>.  Saying that as if nothing could be done and as if every single programmer's life should be Java/C# + ORM + XML + SQL hell?<p>There are people trying to make our life as devs easier.  Why not try to listen to what their saying?<p>Is Rich Hickey ""seeing things"" with Clojure + Datomic?<p>To me the combination of a functional language (or at least a language that can be used in a mostly functional way) and a CRA DB (Create Read Append) which incorporates the notion of time from the start is a godsend to our industry.<p>Why do you close your eyes?",1357743377

Bugs will happen. There is no silver bullet.

""Do these pants make me look fat?"" asked by wife elicits a truthful answer, which she's used to but many who witness the exchange are not.<p>A lie of omission would be something on the order of ""is the product ready for market?""  with a response of ""we've done focus groups and the response was positive"" leaving out some useful information like ""positive by +.1%"", which would be a valuable piece of information to have for the questioner but one in which the respondent does not want to provide since it would probably negate the response.<p>Remaining silent seems to me often to be none of the above.

I.e. in addition to the C code, which you can build and run, it also generates that same functionality in Java code, which you can run on JRE.  So the game engine itself would be specified in clojure, and yet it would be ""automatically implemented"" across two very-different platforms!  It's a fun challenge, I think.  Maybe not doable, or doable only in a horrible way, but still fun.<p>But the point is this:  that's a great example of a problem which would be pretty much impossible in a non-lisp language.

However, they tend to lack understanding of the underlying, 'unwritten' rules governing all types of social intercourse. They are often too open, direct or personal in their interactions with others, and do not recognize the social constraints that would be apparent to other people in the same situation. In other cases their social naivetZ and lack of inhibition can lead them to tell tales or to say things that might hurt or embarrass other people. Such behaviour is rarely intentional or malicious, but occurs because the individual may not understand the social implications of his or her utterances. Similarly, adults with WS will not hesitate to try and gain other peoples' attention with comments and questions, or to reprimand others. Consequently they may give the impression of being rude, bossy or attention seeking, which again may antagonize others if they are not fore-warned.<p>-- ADULTS WITH WILLIAMS SYNDROME: GUIDELINES FOR EMPLOYERS & SUPERVISORS By Orlee Udwin, Mark Davies, Chris Stinton & Patricia Howlin<p>[/quote]<p>Generally I get asked if I'm stoned or something like this, when I'm only trying to be myself. And if I tell people about my Williams (like my heart conditions and other obvious elfish features, including psychological), it doesn't matter how much truth or scientific backing or reading I bring to the table.

Hooks exist in [an|ever]y half-baked version control system.<p>> b) you're assuming everyone uses a cli interface to git<p>Hooks work through any interface... and can often be applied on the server, so they remain constant for all members of a development team.<p>> c) you're relying on the PHP linter to identify errors<p>No, I was giving an example.

Imagine for a second that this is some company launching a brand new game console. In much the same way that Sony entered the market with the PS1 or Microsoft with the XBOX. Does the installed base of games matter? Not if the console maker can drive an initial set of games on launch that are compelling enough to drive people to buy the console in large numbers, and then the installed base of consoles will incentivize other games makers to target the console. Valve has the advantage here that they are already a top tier game studio and they already have quite cozy relations with a lot of game makers and publishers.<p>Will it work?

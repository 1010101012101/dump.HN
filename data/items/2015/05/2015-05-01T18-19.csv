9473730,comment,9469175,9469611,0,0,deathcap,,,"> Should have been implemented in Java :/<p>If you are looking for an open source Minecraft-compatible  implementation in Java, I humbly suggest (shameless plug) checking out <a href=""https://github.com/GlowstonePlusPlus/GlowstonePlusPlus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/GlowstonePlusPlus/GlowstonePlusPlus</a>. Glowstone++ like TrueCraft currently only implements the server portion, and it has some differences such as targeting 1.8.4 compatibility not 1.7.3 beta, but being implemented in Java has some significant benefits.<p>For those not aware there is a huge ecosystem of additions available for Minecraft written in Java. This includes thousands of &quot;Bukkit plugins&quot; available from <a href=""http://dev.bukkit.org/categories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.bukkit.org/categories/</a>, Spigot plugins from <a href=""http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/</a>, and now an emerging community of Sponge plugins from <a href=""https://forums.spongepowered.org/c/plugins/plugin-releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.spongepowered.org/c/plugins/plugin-releases</a>. Writing Minecraft-compatible software in Java has the advantage of being able to potentially support these plugins. Glowstone++ in fact implements much of the Bukkit API and Spigot API, as well as (currently a small subset of) the Sponge API through a bridge. Based on the original Glowstone server, Glowstone++ is completely open source, yet it ties into the existing &quot;Minecraft&quot; plugin development ecosystem.<p>Java has some disadvantages of course as well, so it&#x27;s good to see alternative implementations in other languages (not only C# TrueCraft, but C++ MC-Server, Rust Hematite, JavaScript PrismarineJS, etc). The more choice the better =)",1430506763

If you funded someone like Evan Spiegel, you didn&#x27;t talk about it. You just pretended that it didn&#x27;t happen and called it a learning experience. Now, we have a culture that values material success at the expense of all else, isn&#x27;t really about technology or progress, and views Sean Parker levels of douchebaggery as a positive trait.<p>The Bay Area used to be for misfits who chose to go off and do their own thing: live among the redwoods, play with circuits and computers, go mountain biking. Now it&#x27;s full of self-marketers who create the impression that they do all of that stuff, while actually being unimaginative corporate drones even worse than the last generation&#x27;s kind.<p>All of that said, Silicon Valley has a long history and it&#x27;s not going to be ruined forever by a few bad years. If Silicon Valley gets back to a culture of invention, and if we fix the culture by regulating VCs a bit (a start would be to block the anti-competitive back-channelling and social proof checking; we couldn&#x27;t eradicate all of it <i>de facto</i> but making it illegal would change behaviors enough to give us a chance at fixing the place) it could return to its old promise.<p>Another thing that Silicon Valley needs to do in order to save its character is fix the cost-of-living issue by crushing some NIMBYs. I think that the federal government needs to step in and crush every anti-development policy, unless there is a legitimate environmental issue.<p>I sincerely hope that the Valley does survive, because if you take the long view and look over the past 50 years instead of the past 5, you see that it has done more good than bad for the world.",1430506733

For example, <a href=""http://www.solare-bruecke.org/infoartikel/Papers_%20from_SCI_Conference_2006/22_wolfgang_scheffler.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solare-bruecke.org/infoartikel/Papers_%20from_SCI...</a> describes a 3.4m² kilowatt prototype solar oven successfully used to cremate chunks of goat meat at temperatures of 800° to 900° in under an hour.<p>Larger solar ovens (usually known as “solar furnaces”) can reach 4000°, adequate not just for cooking or even cremation but also for firing terra-cotta, blowing glass, calcining lime, firing earthenware, making glass, firing porcelain, calcining portland cement, making borosilicate glass, casting aluminum, melting porcelain, purifying metals by zone melting, casting iron, smelting iron, casting steel, melting lime refractory, making quartz glass, casting basalt, boiling aluminum, vaporizing steel, vaporizing quartz, vaporizing lime refractory, melting tungsten, and sublimating graphite.  Although people have been doing most of these with solar ovens for a while, especially the famous solar furnace at Odeillo, you can’t do <i>all</i> of these with Iron Age materials; apparently if you want to do anything useful with melted tungsten, you have to use Ta₄HfC₅ or similar.<p>Of course none of this works when it’s cloudy or dark, although molten-salt heat storage might be a usable solution to that even at a household scale.",1430506661

9473710,comment,9472848,9473518,0,0,Animats,,,"That was taken very seriously at the time. I went to a well-attended talk at Stanford by a Stanford physicist who was trying to replicate the Pons/Fleischman experiment. When they first set up the apparatus, they had radiation detectors with alarms, in case it started generating a dangerous level of neutrons. After some initial tests where not much happened, they moved the radiation alarm gear back a bit.<p>Total measured neutron output, best case, appeared to be twice background. That&#x27;s small enough that people moving around (people are mostly water) was enough to cause such variation. So they moved the experiment to a &quot;neutron cube&quot;, a big box built of lead bricks where few background neutrons penetrated. Then there was no significant difference in neutron levels between &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot;.<p>They also tried heat generation measurement. Because you have to put power into the Pons/Fleischman apparatus to get anything to happen (it&#x27;s not self-sustaining) it&#x27;s a difficult experiment to do accurately.  It requires water jackets, insulation, and lots of measurements.  They were unable to detect any heat output above measurement noise.",1430506638

Analysis of vehicle and applicable torque would be a primary issue.<p>> Also with ten small units you have 10x the parts which can break down.<p>Indeed. However, I&#x27;m looking at using automotive lines already in production for replacement parts. That way, farmers would only have to go to XYZ local automotive place. It&#x27;s foolish to not use already well engineered parts in a nationwide distribution.<p>Also, the other big problem is the John Deere issue: proprietariness. If I designed the tractor, this system would be open and easy for the farmer to repair. That would be the next goal. So yes, there would be 10x the parts that could die. It also means that your production is spread across that many machines. One machine down means you still have 90% production capacity.<p>> But maybe there ate mitigating factors and maybe crops like beans could be planted with smaller tractors.<p>Smaller, and autonomous. That&#x27;s the goal here. There&#x27;s little reason we couldn&#x27;t have a fully autonomous tractor. We already have cars that can do the similar on roads.

Within engineering we are a passionate group of people who are extremely interested in building the software that helps our customers around the country thrive in their local communities. We’re a really small team (currently 13 people) so you’ll have plenty of say around how we develop software going forward.<p>We are currently in the process of modernizing our software platform to be more modular and truly data driven. Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. We’re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that we’re using: Dropwizard, Swagger, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We’re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let&#x27;s save each other&#x27;s time). In addition we’re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.<p>---<p>Founded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local.

I&#x27;m a generalist developer; I like developing with or for anything that&#x27;s intellectually challenging. I&#x27;m not a cowboy coder: I feel that development is about solving problems, and code is how you happen to express the solution. The fact that it has to run on a computer is completely besides the point.<p>I like to learn new things, and when left to my devices I usually master them pretty quickly. To illustrate: when diving into C# for the first time, at my previous job, I went straight from &quot;what are indexed properties?&quot; to &quot;hey, look, expression trees!&quot;; from a relative newcomer to C#/.NET I went to the local language expert in around a year. When playing around with Python I went for metaclasses straight away (they&#x27;re fun!).<p>I like to work on the module-surpassing problems in a large application. I like to solve the large issues keeping back development; I like to think about making development easier for my colleagues. I like progress, I like changing things for the better.

The problem for Twitter, was that it came along too early, had to compromise on its communication vision (the now massive smart phone market wasn&#x27;t primed yet), and now finds itself in the quicksand of being a half-breed legacy product that isn&#x27;t the best solution for any particular thing.<p>Twitter was supposed to be a communication platform. It failed to become that, WhatsApp is going to have a billion users soon and took Twitter&#x27;s future, and Twitter has been left behind as an advanced variation of a status update service. It lost its future, and the product as is has a limited potential that will soon be all tapped out.",1430503943

Far from it. Aside from that, a site being &#x27;static&#x27; is not a meaningful data point here.<p>> SSL is really not cheap CPU wise; it can limit the usefulness of a small, personal, cheap VPS for hosting even moderately popular content.<p>Being somebody who runs a HTTPS-only PDF hosting site off such a cheap VPS, I disagree.

(Mostly Stanford, Google, Y Combinator folks) We&#x27;ve learned a ton, and see an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people - we&#x27;ve started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.
In the last 6 months, we&#x27;ve launched 2 major projects:<p>- App 2.0, the new insurance application for healthcare.gov. It&#x27;s processing 70% of apps coming through the marketplace, and: converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, is mobile-friendly (20% of apps), sits on robust, scalable infrastructure, etc etc. It was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service) ever hosted on Amazon AWS.<p>- Scalable Login System (SLS), the new identity management system for healthcare.gov. Sadly, the main achievement here is that the system is actually up and available, unlike its predecessor. It&#x27;s now saving the taxpayer $70M in annual maintenance costs.<p>Here&#x27;s a Wired article from last summer about us: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/</a><p>We&#x27;re just starting on a few major new projects that have a huge potential to improve our government. We have the technical experience to do things the right way, and the relationships and trust inside government agencies to get things done. Our momentum is strong, the problem is important, and we&#x27;re looking for good people.<p>If you&#x27;re the type that would get fired up about reimagining broken government experiences and technology, please drop us a line at jobs@navahq.com, we&#x27;d love to hear from you!<p>Specifically, we’re looking for:<p>- a product manager with a technical background<p>- a senior devops engineer<p>- a senior full-stack engineer",1430503486

X exists. X is patented. Making a clone of X and using that clone in critical technologies is a risky strategy, unless you get an explicit legal guarantee that you won&#x27;t be sued. It happened to C#, it happened to MP3, it happened to H.264. All very similar situations.<p>Now, you may say that C# is different than MP3 or H.264 because you personally reviewed MS&#x27;s patents and you personally guarantee that none of them actually apply to Mono, so we&#x27;re all in the clear. That is awesome, because as most software developers are not patent lawyers, we lack the ability to do that ourselves. We just know that some people said it&#x27;s a problem, others said it&#x27;s not, and MS itself was silent for quite some time. But it&#x27;s not the same as an affirmative statement from MS saying they&#x27;re not going to sue other C# implementations for patent infringement.<p>You are right that MS may have gotten a bit more attention than another company would have in the same situation. If so, it can be reasonably explained by that old &quot;fool me once&quot; quote. But even so, the whole situation could have been diffused by MS if they wanted to.<p><i>Now we are looking 6 years later and well things have really opened up in C# and mono?</i><p>They seem to have. To be honest I haven&#x27;t been following the developments of the past couple years in great detail because it seems like the &quot;C# on Linux&quot; ship has already sailed.<p>And that&#x27;s a damn shame. I think C# is a great language. It fits a niche that still isn&#x27;t really filled in the Linux ecosystem (although that niche is getting smaller and smaller as time goes on and other technologies develop).",1430503433

Even in the face of years of research by big and small names, even with video, even when you train an animal and show them. They couldn&#x27;t even provide a good hypothesis on why it was not so. It was argued circularly like trying to talk a paranoid schizophrenic out of their false world-view. Very frustrating. I would usually just tell them that if they could find a reason it wasn&#x27;t so, they could easily get a nature paper out of it.",1400828335

7788260,comment,7785782,7786613,2,0,hcrypt,,,">Now, when the program executes, it&#x27;s obviously possible to monitor it and watch what&#x27;s being done.<p>That&#x27;s the trick. It isn&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s loosely stick to your example.<p><pre><code>  if (var == op)\n  { \n    do this\n  }\n  else\n  { \n    do that\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis, when compiled for the hcrypt VM, turns into something like<p><pre><code>  0 La var //look at var\n  1 CMPa op //var==op?\n  2 BEQ 5 //yes\n  3 <do that>\n  4 JMP 6\n  5 <do this>\n  6 <continue>\n</code></pre>\nThe obvious question is: How do you hide what branch is taken? The hcrypt VM (as all processors and TMs) is a state machine. The states essentially are the status flags (zero result, addition overflow, minus result,...) and the program counter PC. In line (address) 1, the machine decides, whether op is equal to var and sets the zero-flag to 1 if this is the case. The comparison is an implicit subtraction, so if the two values are equal, then the result is 0 and the zero flag switches to 1. In the next machine cycle (PC is 3) we want to branch. The branch operation is just a simple assignment (PC=address). The assigned value can be expressed bitwise<p><pre><code>  PC = ((branch AND zero-flag) XOR (PC+1 AND !zero-flag))\n</code></pre>\nCase 1: var==op<p><pre><code>  PC = ((5 AND 1) XOR (3 AND 0))\n</code></pre>\nCase 2: var!=op<p><pre><code>  PC = ((5 AND 0) XOR (3 AND 1))\n</code></pre>\nThinking in wires, this is the implementation of a demultiplexer or selector. This is the essential curcuit for the hcrypt VM and oblivious to an observer. The most basic application is the command selector. Assume, we have the opcode in a register OP and the operands in OP1 and OP2. The ALU then operates like<p><pre><code>  res_add = OP1 + OP2\n  res_sub = OP1 - OP2\n  res_mul = OP1 * OP2\n  res_div = OP1 / OP2\n  result = ((res_add AND OP==ADD) XOR (res_sub AND OP==SUB) XOR (res_mul AND OP==MUL) XOR (res_div AND OP==DIV))\n</code></pre>\nSince all the operands and registers (this incudes the machine opcodes) are encrypted, the observer does know, she&#x27;s looking at a branch selector or an encrypted ALU but she cannot decide what branch is taken or what operation is executed.",1400828154

It even stacks the deck against owning at the start by assuming 100% financing. There&#x27;s a few missing components (mortgage insurance etc.) but even if you add those numbers into this rather detailed analysis, the conclusion doesn&#x27;t change. It&#x27;s actually a good enough analysis that you can just added or subtract a few other scenarios from it yourself and until you&#x27;re describing some very bizarre circumstances, the basic conclusion holds. All the calculations and reasoning are provided here. Buying is unambiguously a better use of your money over the long term.

The only option at that point isn&#x27;t to sell your home and then buy one somewhere else, you can also rent out your current home, and buy a second one. You can continue doing that ad nauseum, except now you&#x27;ve convinced other people to pay for your mortgage instead of you. In the end you&#x27;ll own a few properties and all the people who rented from you will own nothing.<p>Something mentioned in my link but not explicitly in the OP, rent goes up, mortgage payments stay the same or can go down. Over 30 years, your housing burden goes down significantly providing you with increased monthly liquidity.<p>At the end of the day, you own the property at the end and for all years >30 you effectively live for &quot;free&quot; (minus taxes).<p>I urge everybody reading the OP to take a few spare hours and run the numbers themselves and see if the easy conclusion here holds out for them.",1400827400

Even if they had just one patent, it is still worth pursuing this because it puts strain on their legal resources to continue trolling. This is advantage to large company who practically have far more legal resources to spend then individual trolls.<p>The bottom line is that if all tech companies pubically takes oath like Newegg that they would never let patent troll walk away like that I suspect trolling would continue at the current level if at all.",1400826034

I think basically they just re-invented a small aspect of some of the frameworks they dismissed.<p>I have made similar decisions before, and it is more fun and certainly gives a sense of freedom and less to learn, but I think that is generally an incorrect decision and in this case it is particularly obvious.  There are many existing Go web frameworks, and I am sure that some existing Go web frameworks are good enough for Square.<p>This sort of thing is why I prefer to work alone.  Because those types of incorrect decisions are very common.  There is always more than one way to do something.  It is just surprising to me how often engineers carefully select the ways that are inferior (more work, and/or less sophisticated).  Of course, as I said, sometimes I make wrong decisions, but in those cases I can always change my mind.

I write software in a number of different languages and environments. This has got to be the absolute worst coverage of android I&#x27;ve seen. It was less informative than the books covering beta releases. There are typos, not just normal sentence typos but method signatures in the examples.

If you want to get into personal attacks Zigurd let&#x27;s do it, let&#x27;s get the rulers out and do some measuring. Derp derp.<p>[2] The AMA was cancelled because I redacated the names of individuals from my documents (Managers etc) so the Reddit Team decided it was not valid since it could be forged.  That&#x27;s fair enough, it&#x27;s their platform and I was not willing to provide any other than my assessment reports.  I can provide you the email chain if it bothers you that much and you present a compelling enough reason to want to verify it.  However some very diligent Redditors actually did find my full details and contacted me to continue the ama offline.<p>EDIT TO ADD:  It was all very friendly and the AMA Team kicked the concept around for a over a week before they said that the evidence was not in line with their guidelines of total transparency.

UK intelligence services have no powers of arrest and carry no weapons.  We certainly would not send military forces into a civilian news office so we would, in line with UK and EU legislation, ask the police to intervene once a legal mandate had been proven.<p>The Guardian knew GCHQ had an airtight case, it is why they complied.  No men in black with assault rifles were forthcoming.  What would have happened is, the place would have been closed, a thorough audit of IT and Magnetic Media would have been conducted.  Everything with <i>anything</i> classified on it would have been destroyed.  The building reopened.<p>The Government was doing the the Guardian a favour by saying &quot;Look, we only want these specific info dumps.  Carry on business as normal, just give us these or we go to the law and take everything.&quot;<p>Exactly the same way a policemen might let you off with a caution if you are caught speeding and apologise.  If you fight him, he impounds the car on the spot and uses the full extent of his legally provided powers.  Do you honestly think two guys from GCHQ wanted to be standing in the Guardian on camera watching HDD&#x27;s being grinded for hours??<p>The issue with cloud computing is separate and distinct from recovering a known quantity of classified information.  I really am struggling to comprehend why people are failing to grasp this point.<p>Just because X quantity of classified material exists does not mean you can ignore N quantity that can be removed from circulation.  Also, you have no evidence to support that the material destroyed at the Guardian HQ had been already released in full, had been copied or transmitted to another location.  You have to take each incident on it&#x27;s own merits.  It is what you <i>know</i> to be the facts at the time, not what you <i>hope</i> to be the facts so you can avoid being diligent.",1400825105

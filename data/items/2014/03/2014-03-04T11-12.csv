For engineering fields (not just software) the &#x27;toolmaker&#x27; analogy is a good one i find. Until you understand what involved in making the specialist tools you need for your field, and can actually make those tools yourself then you are far from mastery.<p>This is not entirely straightforward though - a bit of a rabbit hole you could say. e.g. should a programmer stop at the compiler? The CPU? The circuitry? Electronic components? The laws of nature? Tools are built with other tools after all and some tools are provided by nature...<p>On the other hand, if you haven&#x27;t made even the first step towards understanding your tools then thats not really a problem to worry about.",1393934236

7339668,comment,7339313,7339622,34,0,pron,,,"But algorithms don&#x27;t create an economy – people do (and I actually have a degree in Mathematics). I don&#x27;t have a problem with Bitcoin being hacked: that can and will be fixed. I do have a problem with the very notion of a &quot;trustless&quot; economy for two reasons: first, there ain&#x27;t no such thing (it&#x27;s like a worshipper-free religion). Economy <i>equals</i> trust. An economy needs credit and it needs insurance, and you can&#x27;t have those without trust (heck, the word &quot;credit&quot; literally <i>means</i> &quot;to believe&quot;). Second, even if you could imagine such a thing, where a robot would compel you to pay up, or an algorithm would make decisions for you, why in god&#x27;s name would you even want to? Why take away the freedom of people to come together and make collective decisions about the economy (say, like devaluating a currency) for their society&#x27;s benefit? Why, because some people are crooks? The kind of society you picture is, literally, an autistic one.<p>While you don&#x27;t want people to think that Bitcoin is failing after ceaseless thefts, you call our institutions &quot;failing&quot; based on what? I don&#x27;t know about you, but my institutions aren&#x27;t failing. They just require regular maintenance.<p>Also, if you think Bitcoin is about creating a new kind of trustless economy (in other words, the very same economy that existed prior to the modern one or in lawless frontiers like the Wild West), you are mistaken in believing that most people will follow you. That is precisely the libertarian politics that hangs around Bitcoin&#x27;s neck, and if anything will choke it, this will be it. Forget about who&#x27;s right and who&#x27;s wrong. The reality is that most freedom-loving people aren&#x27;t libertarian. They like their institutions and want to fix them. They don&#x27;t want a trustless economy. We may be misguided; we might be wrong; but we&#x27;re the vast, vast majority.<p>And if you like history, you probably know that people have been warning about the collapse of modern institutions pretty much since their inception. There were always those who wanted to grab their gold and head for the hills because the system is falling apart. And let me tell you that there were times the system was close to crumbling, but today we&#x27;re not even close to such a big crisis. Nevertheless, the vast majority of people have put their faith in their institutions, and for about 500 years now, they&#x27;ve been right (well, more or less).",1393933874

7339666,comment,7335211,7338421,3,0,dasil003,,,"> <i>And honestly, Rails already has something that works beautifully for an “interactor” extraction. It&#x27;s called ActiveModel.</i><p>The thing which Rails and DHH offer no guidance whatsoever is the separation of persistence from the domain model.  The Active Record pattern is itself a conflation of those two things, so this is an opinionated choice, and I respect it as a sane default for a wide variety of applications.  It works perfectly fine up to a certain scale but when the business logic reaches a certain complexity and the persistence logic reaches a certain complexity then it makes sense to separate them.  A lot of proposed solutions might be overkill, but keep in mind that DHH and the company formerly known as 37signals specialize in minimalist software, so they combat this complexity from the UX down rather than conceiving architectures to support it.  I agree with this philosophy insomuch as all else being equal, simpler is better, but the problem is that some applications are necessarily more complex than Basecamp, and sometimes we need more than what Rails provides out of the box.  Convincing DHH of this is pointless because he doesn&#x27;t have to deal with it and he has no incentive to understand anyone else&#x27;s pain in this regard.",1393933834

Promoting the status quo in math education, as you are doing, has been, is, and will continue to be a failure that drives kids away from learning. There are now decades of evidence of the failures of k-12 education to address this need and I find it unbelievable that you haven&#x27;t gotten the picture yet.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that what I&#x27;m proposing is correct, but continuing the very poor pedagogical approach that you support is not going to solve the educational failures that we&#x27;re experiencing today. What we need are fundamentally new approaches to Math education. You are not providing any insight into what those approaches should be.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but in a discussion to fix and change what is obviously utterly broken in k-12 maths education, suggesting to just continue the course is not a helpful contribution and is simply part of perpetuating the problem.<p>This has been recognized for so long, that it has finally percolated out of educational establishment, which has failed to address the problem with undereducated and unqualified teachers, student motivation, repeated failures in curriculum development (<i>Common Core</i> is simply the latest joke of a curriculum), and has reached levels as high as the White House for targeting. You <i>have</i> to know that the current approaches are failing if the President has to get involved.<p>From the &quot;Report to the President...K-12 education in STEM&quot;\n<a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-stemed-report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ost...</a><p>&quot;Schools often lack teachers who know how to teach science and mathematics effectively, and who know and love their subject well enough to inspire their students. Teachers lack adequate support, including appropriate professional development as well as interesting and intriguing curricula.&quot;<p>&quot;As a result, too many American students conclude early in their education that STEM subjects are boring, too difficult, or unwelcoming, leaving them ill-prepared to meet the challenges that will face their generation, their country, and the world.&quot;<p>&quot;Put together, this body of evidence suggests that grade-school children do not think as simplistically about STEM subjects as conventional curricula assume. They are capable of grasping both concrete examples and abstract concepts at remarkably early ages. Conventional approaches to teaching science and math have sometimes been shaped by misconceptions about what children cannot learn rather than focusing \non students’ innate curiosity, reasoning skills, and intimate observations of the natural world.&quot;<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=7v2gRGuxw4sC&pg=PA253&lpg=PA253&dq=National+Research+Council.+(2001).+Adding+It+Up:+Helping+Children+Learn+Mathematics.+Washington,+DC:+National+Academies+Press&source=bl&ots=AgRbbDK-Z4&sig=kAkWvPXWg36IJ6wAynh-tpmfRtY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7LYVU62RFePw0wGm7oHoAQ&ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=National%20Research%20Council.%20(2001).%20Adding%20It%20Up%3A%20Helping%20Children%20Learn%20Mathematics.%20Washington%2C%20DC%3A%20National%20Academies%20Press&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=7v2gRGuxw4sC&pg=PA253&lpg=P...</a><p>&quot;The first principle of How People Learn emphasizes both the need to build on existing knowledge and the need to engage students&#x27; preconceptions -- particularly when they interfere with learning. In mathematics, certain preconceptions that are often fostered early on in school settings are in fact counterproductive. Students who believe them can easily conclude that the study of mathematics is &#x27;not for them&#x27; and should be avoided if at all possible.&quot;<p>I differ from this report in that they continue to promote a bottom-up approach to maths education. I think math should be taught from a top-down approach, like nearly every other discipline. You don&#x27;t learn to bake a cake by first spending 10 years learning about chemistry, agriculture, nutrition, animal husbandry, distillation etc. You say &quot;I want to bake a cake&quot; and you start with a simple cake recipe.

It&#x27;s comments like this that make people skeptical about Bitcoin in the first place, because it demonstrates that BTC supporters don&#x27;t understand what the economy, or even money, is.<p>Ok, when I studied history many years ago, I took a class in early modern Europe (think 15-16th centuries). That was when modern capitalism first gradually appeared. The most important thing to understand about the origins of modern capitalism is the change in society it required. That change was the transition from a face-to-face society (where you personally knew all the people you transacted with) to a society of strangers, where you had to put faith not only in complete strangers, but in people whom you&#x27;d never met and never would meet. Most importantly, you had to put faith in <i>institutions</i>. That was when the first institutions started, modeled after the oldest institution of all, the Roman Catholic Church. There was a time when there were no institutions (well, other than the church). People couldn&#x27;t even understand the concept of an institution: they knew there was a guy named John and a guy named Paul, but what the hell is a group of people that has an identity of its own, and lasts more than its members?<p>Anyway, modern capitalism required institutions, most important among which were banks and insurers. Insurers reduced risks and encouraged investment while bankers lent money to support such investments. Now, when you put your money in the bank, it <i>has</i> to be loaned to others, otherwise the economy will come to a standstill. You have to put faith in the bank to get the money back to you. Same with insurance. You have to have faith in the insurer to pay your claim, or, at the very least, faith in the court to compel the insurer to pay up.<p>The way you look at BTC, disconnects money, a central instrument in the economy, from the economy at large. That doesn&#x27;t make sense, and even if no one ever steals your money, your money won&#x27;t &quot;work&quot;, because there will be no economy to use it in. A modern economy is built on trust. Trust that in the long run, most people will be honest because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s best for them, and they know it. If we don&#x27;t have trust in institutions, there will be no economy to speak of, or, rather, there will be a very primitive one (only, this time, with computers). In that case, I suggest you take good care of your machine, because in your utopia there will be no new models coming out.

Few use electronic lab books and even fewer associate those with experimental data.<p>I think that is what is really missing, a push to easy-to-use electronic lab books that use open, machine- and human-readable formats and a straightforward way of associating these with the generated data.

7339529,comment,7338331,7338331,2,0,chris_wot,,,"Well this is ironic. Here is Bill Gates&#x27; letter to the Homebrew Club, dated February 3, 1976:<p>To me, the most critical thing in the hobby market right now is the lack of good software courses, books and software itself. Without good software and an owner who understands programming, a hobby computer is wasted. Will quality software be written for the hobby market?<p>Almost a year ago, Paul Allen and myself, expecting the hobby market to expand, hired Monte Davidoff and developed Altair BASIC. Though the initial work took only two months, the three of us have spent most of the last year documenting, improving and adding features to BASIC. Now we have 4K, 8K, EXTENDED, ROM and DISK BASIC. The value of the computer time we have used exceeds $40,000.<p>The feedback we have gotten from the hundreds of people who say they are using BASIC has all been positive. Two surprising things are apparent, however, 1) Most of these &quot;users&quot; never bought BASIC (less than 10% of all Altair owners have bought BASIC), and 2) The amount of royalties we have received from sales to hobbyists makes the time spent on Altair BASIC worth less than $2 an hour.<p>Why is this? As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?<p>Is this fair? One thing you don&#x27;t do by stealing software is get back at MITS for some problem you may have had. MITS doesn&#x27;t make money selling software. The royalty paid to us, the manual, the tape and the overhead make it a break-even operation. One thing you do do is prevent good software from being written. Who can afford to do professional work for nothing? What hobbyist can put 3-man years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product and distribute for free? The fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money in hobby software. We have written 6800 BASIC, and are writing 8080 APL and 6800 APL, but there is very little incentive to make this software available to hobbyists. Most directly, the thing you do is theft.<p>What about the guys who re-sell Altair BASIC, aren&#x27;t they making money on hobby software? Yes, but those who have been reported to us may lose in the end. They are the ones who give hobbyists a bad name, and should be kicked out of any club meeting they show up at.<p>I would appreciate letters from any one who wants to pay up, or has a suggestion or comment. Just write me at 1180 Alvarado SE, #114, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87108. Nothing would please me more than being able to hire ten programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software.<p>Bill Gates<p>General Partner, Micro-Soft<p>---<p>48 years later, it turns out that the following response highlighted the answer:<p><a href=""http://www.digibarn.com/collections/newsletters/homebrew/V2_02/homebrew_V2_02_p2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digibarn.com/collections/newsletters/homebrew/V2_...</a>",1393930949

7339521,comment,7339313,7339483,2,0,tbb,,,"We already do have such vaults. At least most traditional banks in Europe have storage vaults for their clients. e.g. you can lend 1 usually quite cheaply, e.g. 60eur / year.<p>A bank teller is always present while you&#x27;re making a withdrawal, and you need 2 keys to open your vault. 1 key from the teller, and 1 key from you.<p>The chances of this kind of vault getting robbed is very, very slim. If you&#x27;re worried about that, you can BIP38 encrypt your paper wallet&#x27;s private keys, so its impossible to use them even if paper itself is stolen.<p>There is also some chance that the vault will be struck by a flood, earthquake etc. For that, I recommend using a USB as a back-up, where the keys are encrpyted using truecrpyt etc, and the physical drive itself being kept in a very secret location, ideally located in a different city than the bank vault itself, so that the chances of being affected by the same disaster as your vault is minimized.<p>This is almost a failproof setup in my opinion (you can worry about loosing your Bip38 or truecrypt encryption keys, or what happens if you die etc -- there are good ideas about how to deal with these kind of circumstances as well, e.g. write a hint for BIP38 key which only you or your family may understand on the paper wallet).<p>So best place to store your wallet might very well be your good old bank, ironic enough.",1393930841

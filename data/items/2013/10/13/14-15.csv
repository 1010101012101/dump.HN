So, who&#x27;s position sits better with you?<p>Look, the best we can do is take care of the <i>actionable</i> problems in front of us. I don&#x27;t consider &quot;get vast numbers of people out of poverty&quot; to be an actionable problem. I don&#x27;t study poverty, I don&#x27;t know what statistically significant levers to pull (or try to pull). I just know that when I see a situation like Meem&#x27;s, I know I can help so I can at least make the effort.<p>And who knows? Maybe in trying to help one person I&#x27;ll have some insight (currently lacking) into the larger problems. But I find it hard to take that someone can sit back in their armchair, never having helped a single person out of poverty in their life, criticizing someone for taking concrete action because it doesn&#x27;t address the larger issues.<p>The simple fact is that unless you have vast wealth, or you have a tremendous amount of influence on those with wealth, then you have about as much ability to address larger issues as I do, that is, nil.

But as parting words I&#x27;d like to say:<p>To those who&#x27;ve ever upvoted a well intentioned humorous comment that gave a slight chuckle or reprieve from the (amazingly thought provoking and informative) super on-topic and serious comments that are encouraged on this site. - I absolutely and unequivocally salute you.",1381675876

I understand that having your solution written in two languages generally requires more effort to keep things working, and it&#x27;s more difficult to find qualified developers to hire. To me, it just seems like it would make more sense to use each language&#x27;s strengths where you need them instead of trying to graft all the features you could ever want into a single language (which, IMO, is basically what C++ does, to it&#x27;s detriment).",1381675369

The accompanying effects (things like the impact on the standard of living, cumulative expenses for the employer) may actually make their situation worse. If their employer must have the role fulfilled, then their costs increase which means decisions such as raising the price of the good/service, reducing operational costs (lower quality, or fewer workers), outsourcing, etc.<p>I&#x27;m all for people being paid a fair wage, but just think that a solution that focuses on one symptom may only make things worse. I think that the real problem is that, for the most part, the economy is so sick that decision-makers are either too afraid or too incapable of doing a proper RCA and triage of the problem. It feels like we&#x27;ve been treating symptoms and not the problem(s).",1381675326

6542668,comment,6541721,6542335,2,0,Pitarou,,,"Oh splendid.  Yet another theory that breaks down people into &quot;types&quot; and tells us that we have to handle these different &quot;types&quot; in different ways.  I&#x27;ll put it on the shelf next to Gardner&#x27;s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, the four hippocratic humours, &quot;left-brain vs. right-brain&quot;, Myers-Brigg, the various zodiac systems, blood group personality theory (very popular here in Japan) and all the other dross<p>Take, for instance, Gardner&#x27;s Theory of Multiple Intelligences.  That&#x27;s the one that talks about kinaesthetic intelligence, verbal intelligence and so on.  It is unusual, because it actually makes a prediction that we can test: students do best when taught in a style that most closely matches their intelligence type (the &quot;meshing hypothesis&quot;).<p>There are many studies that claim to test and support the meshing hypothesis.  But, to cut a long story short, most of them test a different version of the hypothesis that is so weak as to be almost tautological.  The very few that really do test the meshing hypothesis invariably do NOT support it.  After 30 years of looking for evidence to support Gardner&#x27;s theories, the American Psychological Association gave up, and announced that, unless and until somebody produces some hard evidence, they will consider the theory discredited.<p>So is that the end for multiple intelligence?  Hardly!  Teacher training colleges still teach it.  Elite schools still publish reports describing the wonderful results they got when they modified their curriculum according to Gardner&#x27;s recommendations.  (Invariably, it turns out they did nothing of the sort.  They just introduced more variety into their classroom activities -- they certainly DIDN&#x27;T target particular activities towards particular learners.)  And so on.<p>You cite the following evidence in support of Kahler&#x27;s theories:<p>1. The Clintons support it.<p>2. NASA talked to Kahler when they were developing their astronaut recruitment program.<p>To the former, I say, &quot;so what&quot;?<p>As for the latter, I actually took a nanosecond to follow the links you gave, and what they said was something like, &quot;Kahler told the NASA scientists to screen out the quitters&quot;.  Well, I guess that&#x27;s an important point, but I&#x27;d hardly call it a complete vindication for his theories.<p>So I scream &quot;bullshit!&quot;.  And I will continue to do so until you show me:<p>1. A non-trivial, falsifiable prediction grounded in Kahler&#x27;s work.<p>2. A good quality study that tests this prediction and finds in Kahler&#x27;s favor.",1381674137

I can easily restrict my use of jokes, but I can&#x27;t support a country that disallows some of the most basic human rights, namely the freedom of speech (which I consider country-wide, not like the American version where you have to stand in a free speech zone to exercise the right). I hope the good people from the developer community in USA will attend the European conferences, so we can still meet and share experiences.<p>Also, this isn&#x27;t just jokes as to what you are referring, it&#x27;s jokes that any way involves security at airports, as I understand it.

I do think though that asana&#x27;s lack of opinion or convention and freedom of how to structure the tasks is what some people may feel is &quot;complex&quot;.<p>It seems like anything that requires a bit of thought or self controlled structure people seem to tag as complexity. In a cyber world where usability and simplicity is defined by a users lack of need to think much as they are using the app, this totally makes sense. But as a user of asana myself, I have found once you get past that &quot;feeling of complexity&quot; - which is just a matter of deciding your own conventions, then asana is a beautifully simple collaborative tool. Flexibility is not complexity, although it may feel like it is because it requires more effort on our own part to establish the workflow.",1381673064

Most people sat around quietly, or talking to people they worked with. I always waited for someone else to start a conversation with me, until I realized most other people are doing the exact same thing, which led to very little conversation.  Now, I will try to engage the other people at the table by asking about their job, or the presentations they&#x27;ve seen. Usually people are relived at having someone talk to them without staring the conversation themselves.  It does however require taking that first step of initiating, which can be the hardest part.",1381673060

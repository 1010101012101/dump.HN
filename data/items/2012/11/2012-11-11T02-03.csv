4768629,comment,4752047,4757673,1,0,doug363,,,"Things like racism (and other related -isms like sexism and to a lesser extent, ageism) are considered bad because they can be, and typically are, exercised against people based on largely uncontrollable aspects of their outward appearance. Everyone subconsciously creates associations between appearance, race, and social status throughout their entire lives, whether they realize it or not, and then makes judgments about new people they meet in light of those associations. Those judgments based on outward appearance are part of an initial impression then taint other subsequent judgments (and actions), such those as about a person's character or intelligence. Also, people learn that it's socially acceptable and generally expected to treat (say) a black person is with less respect than (say) a white person. And entrenched ideas about what people's social status ought to be cause a feedback loop that tends to impose these ideas on subsequent generations.<p>There are lots of other external properties that people are generally prejudiced for or against, such as weight/height/build, (dis)ability, posture, voice/speech properties, dress sense, and so on; but these (a) are considered to be more under an individual's control, (b) aren't inherited, and (c) historically haven't caused anywhere near as many social problems as racism in the US. No doubt people who are  discriminated against based on their voice (say) don't like it, but it's not considered to be a systematic, self-reinforcing, widely-observed, entrenched social problem.<p>A hypothetical prejudice against ""SSN % 104 == 7"", where the property is not even outwardly observable (so can't genreally taint initial impressions), nor subject to this ongoing reinforcement, nor passed down through generations (neither the prejudiced property, nor the prejudice itself), is completely different from race, even moreso than the other examples.",1352602755

If you don't like the !ac you'll find a way to tell me I'm wrong but there really isn't any third party crapware on the Mac. You don't get security alerts every 2 seconds, and uninstalls really do just uninstall apps. You know exactly what to expect when you buy a Mac and the experience stays roughly the same throughout the lifetime of the machine. You <i>can</i> get crapware on a Mac but its pretty rare.<p>So basically you get a machine in mint condition. And yeah, it is like Linux in that when you install the OS it's the OS and nothing more. You can talk about freedom and locked down platforms all day long and I'll even agree but thats neither here nor there. Point is, the Mac isn't screaming for your attention, doesn't come preloaded with shit, and generally doesn't fuck with you in the same way Linux doesnt do those things.

Nobody disputes that suspected straw purchasers under surveillance by the ATF repeatedly bought guns that eventually fell into criminal hands. Issa and others charge that the ATF intentionally allowed guns to walk as an operational tactic. But five law-enforcement agents directly involved in Fast and Furious tell Fortune that the ATF had no such tactic. They insist they never purposefully allowed guns to be illegally trafficked. Just the opposite: They say they seized weapons whenever they could but were hamstrung by prosecutors and weak laws, which stymied them at every turn.
Indeed, a six-month Fortune investigation reveals that the public case alleging that Voth and his colleagues walked guns is replete with distortions, errors, partial truths, and even some outright lies. Fortune reviewed more than 2,000 pages of confidential ATF documents and interviewed 39 people, including seven law-enforcement agents with direct knowledge of the case. Several, including Voth, are speaking out for the first time.""",1352602179

I had to mail it back to a repair center in California. It took over a week to get the RMA information as Sys76's Customer Service has very limited hours and seems stretched pretty thin. I needed the laptop back ASAP, and System76 made me pay $80-some to get overnight shipping labels both ways so that there wouldn't be 1-2 week delays each way.<p>I got the system back, and it seemed to work, but now I was getting a lot of crashes. I tolerated it for a couple of months as it wasn't so severe to make the system completely unusable, but I eventually got sick of dealing with it. memtest immediately reported some severely damaged RAM, so I emailed System76 and again, after a protracted paperwork/support process, they mailed me replacement parts to install myself (the only alternative to shipping the whole laptop back off to California; the disk is encrypted, but still was not looking forward to the potential of a careless tech wiping it and another $80+ bill to make sure it got back to me within the month).<p>I installed the new RAM modules (and I'll say that it was quite easy to take apart, only exception being the keyboard ribbon, much better than my old MBP) and things were going better, but I <i>still</i> get full system hangs in 3D games. I am concerned that there is a hardware issue with the GPU. Haven't cared enough to tackle that one seriously yet, as I do most 3D stuff on my desktop, but it's really annoying.<p>If System76 was better with their support processes, these would not be such a big deal, but with their non-cooperation in getting shipped repairs performed and returned quickly, inability to contract out or reimburse for local repairs, long RMA processes and limited customer service availability (no weekends, hours something like 9a-4:30p Mountain), it's just not worth the hassle.<p>Next time I will get a powerful Dell most likely.

We have roughly 80 offices in a bunch of states, and we have a national rep with Groupon who managed all of our standardized deals. However, local reps would still call each local office and try to sell them, and would quote sales rates and repeat customer rates to offices -- numbers that Groupon had no way to obtain, and were so far off the mark it bordered on being hilarious.<p>Another factor is that many businesses that try these steep discount programs is that they are already on the rocks.<p>Another factor that bites merchants: refunds. Supposedly, when you mark a Groupon code as ""redeemed"", Groupon won't refund the customer's money without contacting you first. However, they sometimes still refund the money and try to deduct it from your final check (which, for most merchants IIRC, is 60 days after the close of the deal). This causes a lot of headaches for merchants that have hard costs with their deals (product, inventory, etc). Sadly, some number of Groupon customers request refunds even after redeeming their deal. They are stealing, basically, and the merchant is the one that suffers.<p>> api stuff (couldn't find a good quote to pull from your awesome points, sorry!)<p>That's true for a lot of those markets you mentioned, definitely. A full-fledged API would likely be difficult. There are other businesses that would benefit, though, particularly some franchise units that are starting to use web-based POS systems (per the last International Franchise Assoc conference I attended).<p>If you were a local franchisee of a tanning salon, and your franchisor-provided POS were Groupon-compatible, I'd think you would be more apt to sign up.<p>The merchant console for Groupon is actually very basic, there's not a lot to it. You sign in, view your deals, and can mark individual Groupon ID#s as ""redeemed"". We wrote some terrible code to mock it into an API for our franchisor system, using screen scraping and other monstrosities I am NOT proud of. Do not open groupon.py.",1352600242

I could be wrong here about the extent to which this pollution actually matters for users.<p>With dofsome we are trying to separate the photo presentation into a stand-alone service and allow the user to use their social services as distribution channels for their content.<p>Yeah, no point in competing with S3, better focus on a product built on top of it ;-)<p>At the moment I am thinking about just doing imports from online backup solutions and really focus on the presentation. For a viable storage MVP you definitely need device specific uploaders..",1352599396

To improve the efficiency the way a business is ran you have to understand all its components. In their case it was driving cars, charging transactions, etc. starting crappy is ok as long as you continuously improve.",1413525849

SIM cards are about freedom. Sure, an online infrastructure and the laws to force an implementation of it are technically simple, and could be done, but with thousands of carriers in 200 countries, it&#x27;s never going to be all-encompassing. SIM cards being mandated in the GSM standard in 1991 was amazingly forward-thinking and we have a lot to thank for it today.",1413525829

It seems the city did its best to inform everyone of the reservation system but some people will just ignore the rules. Not that I think it&#x27;s right that the kids can&#x27;t use the fields in the evening. I don&#x27;t know all the details. Maybe there are some evenings blocked off for unreserved use. Maybe the locals want no reservation system at all. There has to be some give and take here. This has been turned into another anti-gentrification, anti-tech issue. At least some of the tech-workers are SF citizens and &quot;locals&quot; too. In some other parts of the world reservation systems work.",1413525778

It was eye opening.<p>First, German workers are forbidden to use social media or check their phones at work. So, instead of checking your text message or facebook, you interact with other workers.<p>Second, workers are given bonuses based on team output. No competition, rather team must work together to get better bonuses.<p>Third, German&#x27;s don&#x27;t ever drown themselves with a mortgage. They just rent for life, but I hear that housing condition is excellent in Germany.<p>Fourth, German mother&#x27;s are incentivized to take care of their children. The heavy taxation discourages moms seeking jobs. This is important for child&#x27;s development to have a mother around.<p>Fifth, German kindergarten is more like spending time in nature, getting dirty in the forest, climbing trees and such.<p>Sixth, students who aren&#x27;t interested in studying can go to trade schools and take up apprenticeship like the article described.<p>For the above reasons, Germany seems to work less hours yet have greater output. They are super efficient and practical with their time. The government also places heavy emphasis in making sure the traditional familial obligations are maintained.<p>What an awesome country.",1413525741

It&#x27;s very difficult for neophytes to visualize flow at these scales, not least because the shape of the viscous boundary layer is on nearly the same size scale as the wing itself. In fact, it was long believed that &quot;ideal&quot; wings for aircraft would have a very thin cross section, primarily because this is what worked so well in the tiny wind tunnels of the day. Just look at the difference between an early WWI fighter and a late WWII bomber. (IIRC, we actually lucked into this for structural reasons! Thicker wings are easier to build!)<p>Over and above that, because the Coanda effect pertains to detached streams, it doesn&#x27;t actually apply to a baseball, nor to wings. The author seems bright enough to handle potential flow calculations, and it would be a very instructive exercise for him to model a 2D flowfield around an airfoil without circulation, and then to input enough circulation to account for the Kutta condition at the trailing edge. I would advise using a &quot;typical&quot; cross section to avoid certain irregularities around the leading edge. <i>Fundamentals of Aerodynamics</i>, by Anderson, is a wonderful read, even if it is surprisingly infuriating to learn how hopelessly wrong typical aerodynamic intuitions are.<p>My fluids prof used to comment that people feel perfectly confident making pronouncements about aerodynamics where they&#x27;d be appalled to make the equivalently technical statements about brain surgery.",1413525609

Routing all content through ""code on demand"", which is effectively what you're doing when you force a JavaScript function to do all the rendering, instead of the browser itself, is not taking advantage of the fast, incremental rendering nature of plain old HTML generated by the server.<p>One can still design good API-oriented URIs with a server-side approach, you're just providing different serializations of the same resource (a nice HTML one and a JSON one for API access).... so there's nothing fundamental that Twitter has  lost or abandoned here.

4041145,comment,4040929,4041083,2,0,bceagle,,,"Ah, yes, I did not see that. Well, after reading the article on the Twitter Engineering site, I think this answers my question about the reasons for the switch:<p>-------\nWhen you come to twitter.com, we want you to see content as soon as possible. With hashbang URLs, the browser needs to download an HTML page, download and execute some JavaScript, recognize the hashbang path (which is only visible to the browser), then fetch and render the content for that URL. By removing the need to handle routing on the client, we remove many of these steps and reduce the time it takes for you to find out whats happening on twitter.com.\n------<p>My original point is still valid, though. Twitter is dealing with a situation where they have a lot of code, a boat load of users and the need to squeeze every bit of optimization out of the site. The initial download of the JavaScript is a one time hit that would not make a bit of difference for most sites. More than likely they were also concerned about the proliferation of API calls due to increased functionality over time. I still think that if your combined and minified JS is < 1MB and you are able to keep your API calls relatively simple, the client side architecture is still pretty powerful.<p>Besides, in many cases I think you can fix performance issues on a one off basis where a page that gets too slow because of heavy JS and/or API proliferation could move server side if that makes sense while the rest of the app rendering stays client side.  It doesn't have to be all or nothing.",1338346409

4041080,comment,4040929,4041015,21,0,anextio,,,"Are you familiar with Model-View-Controller?<p>In this case it would be moving some of the controller logic (the parts responsible for rendering views and dispatching events from the UI) to the browser, and using an API to communicate with the model (and the rest of the controller).<p>So, if I'm going to display a page of 10 tweets, in the classic server side architecture, I load the tweets, render a view template based on a context containing those tweets, and then send the HTML to the browser.<p>In an API-based web application architecture like this, I _always_ send the same HTML, which is cached in memory and is almost a no-op to send to the browser, then the client side scripting looks at the URL of the page and makes a call to a JSON or XML API that will result in those 10 tweets. These tweets are then rendered on the client side by the browser.<p>This is beneficial in a few ways:<p>* You can re-use the exact same API and expose it to third parties, who can then write apps with all the functionality of your webapp, and you've one less thing to test.<p>* Rendering a template can be a (relatively) time-consuming operation that may require some I/O. On a single-threaded platform like Node.js, where you simply want to dispatch an event (request) as fast as possible and move on, rendering a template takes a lot of time.<p>* If the time is going to be spent rendering that template anyway, you may as well crowdsource it and let the browser handle it. The browser is probably only processing one page load at a time, whereas your servers could be processing thousands or millions.<p>The cons of using this system are related to the benefits:<p>* The API you use is likely to suffer from Abstraction Inversion[1], or if that's intentionally avoided, a Leaky Abstraction[2]. The reason for this is that there may be some pages to be rendered that require more complex, or less abstract, queries on the data. On the server you could easily issue a JOIN query, but it may not make sense to expose such a thing directly via a RESTful interface. Therefore your application may end up firing numerous API requests and joining the results manually in order to complete a request. If you DO expose this functionality, it will probably end up looking very out of place and very specific.<p>* The extra time spent by the browser may not be suitable in all cases. It poses a number of accessibility and performance problems on certain devices. I may not be able to use a certain website with a screen reader because of this, or I may not be able to view it on an ancient version of Opera running on a shitty old phone over 3G. Even on a modern smartphone, the time taken from seeing a Twitter page's header and background with the loading indicator to actually seing the content was a pain in the ass.<p>* Depending on your application and architecture, you may be able to deliver even better performance by caching rendered templates than by offloading it to the browser. For example, I believe Reddit pretty much prerenders and caches every single page on the site, which is why most stuff loads instantly, but at peak times it takes a while to load the message inbox, or the 80th page of posts. This might be made even worse by extra API calls and client side rendering.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_inversion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_inversion</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction</a>",1338345174

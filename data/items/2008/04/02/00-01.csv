152656,story,,,6,14,PStamatiou,"Ask YC: Speaking at your first conference",,"I have been invited to speak/lead a discussion at a tech conference in Italy this summer. It appears to be a large thing, turns out Aaron Swartz is also on the speaker list. I said that I'd go (after telling my summer class profs I'd be out a while). My ""speaking"" experience is comprised of various class presentations and pitching Skribit.com at a startup weekend and a handful of interviews. I'm not so much concerned about the talking as I am actually answering (hard) questions from the audience. What do you do to prepare? It's not until July so I have time.<p>Thanks",1207097815

That wasn't my intent and on re-reading, I can see that it came across that way. I offer my apology.<p>I was writing a bit more emotionally than I usually do, and, as I said in the post, am much more frustrated with those who provide startup advice ignoring the power of SEO than I am with startups who don't engage in it. Startups have a million things on their plates. Those who make lists recommending marketing practices have just one task, and I think it's negligent to ignore such a valuable marketing tactic for web-based companies.",1207096477

I switched to compose music.  It's a huge difference.  This bodes well for the taste of the upcoming generation.<p>The only time I have missed my PC was when I wanted to delete forward from the cursor.

The Macbook felt sluggish for me.  My typical usage pattern is several browser windows open with about 15 tabs open apiece, plus an IRC client, iTunes/VLC, a shell window, and Textmate (a text editor).<p>Upgrading to the Pro made things feel a lot faster for me.",1207095583

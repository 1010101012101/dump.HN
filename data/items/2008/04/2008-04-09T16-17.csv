<a href=""http://featurelist.org/info/features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://featurelist.org/info/features</a><p>It won't always remain so, but at the moment, the average spambot isn't processing javascript or iframe content to populate spam forms. For now it seems the spammers are content to submit to open/typical HTML forms.<p>To compare some of the spam levels we get on our site bug.gd:<p>* We have open email addresses on our site. These are spammed insanely.<p>* We have a feedback widget (powered by featurelist). This has never been spammed and is getting us great user data.<p>* We have basic HTML search forms, comment forms, and solution forms. These are spammed 10 or more times a day.<p>* Our blog comments receive a good bit of spam each week.<p>All in all, widgets are pretty resistant at the moment. (Please no one here start a company to do this. Of course someone will.)",1207760252
158967,comment,158851,158937,0,0,hooande,,,"That sounds like an interesting idea, but I'm thinking that the line between success and failure is composed of luck and interpersonal relationships.<p>Most of the stories in FaW involve meeting a key person, an important external event or being in the right place at the right time. It's very hard for someone to say ""Well if we had talked more with this one person, I think that we would have stumbled into a great situation a few years later""<p>Likewise I've seen a lot of situations where personal relationships make the difference. Two founders disagree and one of them just has to be ""right"", even if there is evidence that their plan isn't best for the company.<p>So maybe you can work out the characteristics of failed startups by looking at the inverse of the characteristics of successful startups. I'm thinking that they would be: don't be committed to the product, don't explore every relationship and don't have an open mind about new opportunities.",1207760244

158956,comment,158900,158900,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"This article supposes a competition.  Why is it a competition if the essence of creating a startup is creating wealth?  If more companies get off the ground, then more total wealth will be created.  The more startups that are created, then the more total wealth will be created.  Startups are the antithesis of a zero sum game.<p>And, if YCombinator is starting startups, then it is a wealth creation machine.  How will that be ""beat"" or competed against?<p>Also, I don't get the impression from PG that YC is out to dominate the startup market.  I do get the impression that they started YC because it was an irresistible hack.  That is, they set out to hack the economics of startup creation.  And, if another entity comes out and has a greater success ratio, or greater volume of startups created, then I daresay that it is an ultimate success of PG and crew.  Why?<p>Because the hack worked.",1207759480

158952,comment,158049,158721,0,0,kunalupadhyay,,,"Lets not stretch our imaginations too much. We are trying to provide help to hackers with no selfish motives !<p>With all due respect, our aim is not to belittle the hackers - we respect them and the whole spirit behind the program is to actually encourage them to start-up. Our interaction with a lot of tech start-ups (by tech i don't just mean IT) suggests that often the failure is rarely in development of product - it's often in the ability to understand the market and to penetrate it. We might be mistaken, but we feel that IIMA grads can do a good job on that. A good techie+MBA make a better team than an IIMA grad alone or a techie alone does.<p>Equity: We are a not-for-profit entity and don't plan to take equity at this stage - if we decide to provide additional funding to these start-ups we might.<p>Stipend: Yes, India is cheap. However our target audience is students and young IT professionals - the stipend is a sweetener. You get to work on your idea without having to think about how your expenses get paid. (Indian students typically don't take up RA/TAship in their universities and depend heavily on parental income for their education. So we are trying to provide them with a tension-free environment! Ahh, some would still believe it is a jail uh!!)<p>YC Model: We can't be a YC - if we are trying to be we are probably mistaken. Our aim is to be a group which is trying to make a difference to say the least. There have been no Google or Skype coming out of India - but there have been the Naukri.com and the Makemytrip.coms which are some of the more successful names in the Indian dot-com scenario. If you think that the founders of these can add some value, yes mentors would be there. We'll have regular mentoring and weekly networking dinners where you should expect a few successful entrepreneurs/VCs/investors to be around. We are beginners in this and would love to learn on how we could do this better.<p>IIM/Gujarat - the right place: Its at least a start to make the YCombinator culture more popular in India. Hopefully someone else - in the right city and right environment would do a better job. We'd love to see that happen. Not too sure if IIM is the best place - what else is? Are they ready to do it? We've got the resources to help the budding entrepreneurs - so we are trying. Gujarat, may be quite entrepreneurial, but there are very few hackers around. So we don't limit ourselves to Gujarat.",1207759103

Right now the iPhone is the platform that is currently deployed that really gets it, but Google's Android platform and the Nokia Maemo platforms are right behind. In fact Android may not be as pretty but its direct to the middleware access may actually may be a platform thats more accessible for developers.<p>of course I'm biased my YC application is directly in this space ;-) but I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think its the real Web 3.0",1207758693

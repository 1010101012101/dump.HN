They're looking at the PC market, where Dell, HP, Lenovo etc. all have the same interface, consumers have no brand loyalty, there's fierce competition on price, and margins are razor thin.<p>But is there anything actually useful in these software additions? It looks like it's just skins, and maybe some clock and weather widgets. Do people actually say, ""I want to buy another HTC/Samsung phone because they have that widget.""? Manufacturers actually do add their own software onto PCs as well, but it's all shit and bloatware. The closest to useful software from a hardware vendor that I've seen (outside of the exception of Apple) is software for individual components, like EVGA video cards or ASUS motherboards.<p>It's like the hardware manufacturers usually don't think about the actual utility of the software they're putting on the PCs/phones, and the only point of it is some kind of brand differentiation. Which is absurd, when you think about it.",1357664359

5027040,comment,5026611,5026953,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"Well, step back to summer 2011, when Facebook was facing social network fatigue due to, among other things, quality problems in content. This was especially a problem as related to games. People <i>hated</i> the Zynga games and the spam. Facebook had actually solved its spam problem by then, but reputation is a lagging indicator and people were <i>pissed</i> at Facebook about all the shitty games.<p>We needed to brand Google+ as a <i>high-quality</i> social network. That was well-understood to be the strategy, and it was intended as a long-term campaign. Start highbrow, dumb down harmlessly. This wouldn't be hard, because its early adopters were Googlers, who tend to be high-quality people.<p>What makes ""social"" so difficult for Google is that it's ideologically different from Search. In Search, you win if people get in and get out quickly. The less time they spend in getting through, the better you are doing. If you're a Facebook, though, you want people to spend time in your site. That's an ideological discrepancy between Google's very successful Search ideology (get the user in and out so fast the service is invisible) and what you need to do to win in Social.<p>You also need to generate comfort among your users, which is hard to do and can't be forced. Google+ has a lot of awesome tech in it (cf. Hangouts). It's a really neat piece of software. But people need to get into the product and get ""comfortable"" so they can start exploring. Early adopters explore right away. Most users want to be comfortable first. Facebook achieved ""comfort"" within an Ivy League college. It was just a silly thing your friends would see. It didn't start out as a general-purpose social network. Google+ lacked that luxury. It came into the social network space as a fully-fledged product and it's harder to establish social ""comfort"" that way. People are more comfortable with things that develop organically (cf. boiled frog).<p>This makes Games a critical battlefield. Games are a <i>great</i> way to bring people into the site, to get them comfortable, and to get them using the other goodies (e.g. Hangouts). If the games are good, they'll use your product a lot. It was also an arena in which Facebook seriously fucked up by not curating quality. Zynga damaged Facebook's reputation (and community quality, et al) in a major way. Mid-2011 was the nadir of its weakness on that issue. We needed to make that our strength by having some really awesome games. Where would we get them, though?<p>Google did Games, but not with the focus on quality. Again, this is success in Search hurting in Social. Google is admirably non-editorial when it comes to Search. What the web thinks is important is important. If you send someone to a crappy website (that he thought he wanted) so what? 5 seconds wasted, and then he types in a different query. It hardly ruins Google's brand that there's garbage on the Web. Google's job is just to document and facilitate, not to curate (with Search). The problem with Games is that people are looking for quality, but game quality isn't visible until someone plays it for 30 minutes. If you deliver someone a stinker, he resents you for wasting half an hour of his time. He'll associate you with the shitty Zyngarbage and never log in again. We needed to <i>curate</i>, but that doesn't scale, and the people in charge of game selection (while strong in general technical and project-management competence) did not know how to pick games.<p>So I came up with the Excellence In Games (EIG) initiative. Originally, I called it ""Real Games"" (a pun on Real Names). The idea was, instead of publishing dreck from mainstream publishers, who were giving us mediocre product because they didn't expect us to succeed, we court the independent developer community: the people who in 2013 are trolling Kickstarter for their 2D ""retro"" RPGs and German-style boardgames. We court these developers and give them a platform that does for them things they can't do for themselves, plus access to an enormous number of players. We also publish casual games, but only of high quality-- no Zynga dreck. By doing this, we create the image of being a gold standard for game quality. We keep the Google reputation-- <i>we won't waste your time</i>-- intact.<p>The engineers on the G+ Games team were huge fans of EIG and wanted to implement that instead of working with Zynga (who are apparently miserable to partner with) but the senior execs were not fans of this proposal. However, they were proven wrong. Google+ Games failed. Google did the smart thing and covered, which is why you've never heard of Google+ Games, but it's still an enormous missed opportunity.",1357664082

In fairness these aren't your typical ""straight out of $_GET"" vulnerabilities, but they impart a lax attitude towards security. For example, in the latter example above, $rating is escaped just prior to its use in that query, but $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] isn't. In the former, there is no indication whatsoever of where the variable $articlesPerPage has come from so it's impossible to tell.<p>The notion that some variables are ""safe enough"" that they don't need escaping is naive. $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] is a global variable that any other code anywhere in the script can write to. While you can't get owned immediately after putting that code live, it is still a tiny little SQL injection vulnerability waiting behind the scenes for an attacker to chain it together with some other similarly minor flaw and break in.<p>To this day I still come across PHP code that is vulnerable to serious, immediate SQL injection vulnerabilities and it isn't always old code.

5026915,comment,5026611,5026611,9,0,k3n,,,"> Step one: Corral every single blogger. Have you used Google lately and noticed faces appearing next to certain posts? Thats called Google Authorship--bloggers can link their Google Plus profile to the content they create. Guess how many online writers see that and say Eh, I dont need to have that. If you said zero you win a prize.<p>False. I couldn't care less about a silly profile pic. I also don't even use Blogger. Perhaps the author is unaware, but there are quite a few bloggers out there who _aren't_ using Blogger, and who happen to control the ability to alter their blog at-will. This would include putting up silly profile pics or whatever.<p>> Step two: Attract every single small business and at least one of their employees. Want your business to appear on Google Maps, Google Local, et al., so that you can tell your prospective customers where you are, what you sell, and when you are open? Yup, you guessed it--you need a Google Plus Local Business page now.<p>False. You don't _need_ a ""Google Plus Local Business page"" for any of that, Google -- and, apparently, the author (who is playing the role of an agent of Google at this point) -- just wants you to believe that you do.<p>> Step three: Convince you, because all of those other things that you already love get better. Maybe youre addicted to that new augmented reality game Ingress. Maybe your Google Plus profile makes it way easier to win. Or maybe you want better music, movie, or book recommendations--look no further than Google Plus. Want to find a community of skiers or chefs or race car drivers with a flick of the wrist? Or perhaps that hilarious video about that thing that you once emailed to a friend but cant quite remember enough about it to find again? When you have Google Plus, those communities and that video just appear when you search for your best guess.<p>Could he be any more blatant with the Google advertising? I looked for a 'full disclosure' statement but couldn't find one, so I can only assume that the author is drunk on the kool-aid at this point. Regardless, somehow I'm still leading a meaningful, productive life without Google+. I don't know how, maybe I'm a freak of nature.....but I can still easily find music, movie and book recommendations without G+. Astonishingly, I can also still find meetups without G+. And G+ would be the last place I'd ever look to find an old video...<p>With that said, I'm not saying G+ has failed. But it's not for everyone, and the more Google attempts to force me down that path, the more I am going to resist.",1357662270

5026879,comment,5024900,5026238,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Time to have some serious, un-edited conversation here folks.<p>The comments around this question have been really interesting to watch. But the underlying subtext of corporations 'good' vs 'bad' and the level of seriousness it entails when they are dissolved is even more amazing.<p>First off, on a discussion group that is pretty much focused on creating innovation through technology, the concept of corporations is pretty much fundamental. If you hate corporations and everything they stand for then starting one should be the last thing on your mind. Further helping other people create theirs should also be pretty low on your list. Without the existence of these collectives there is no framework for seed rounds, 'happy exits', or IPOs. There is no 'acqui-hire' and no structure in which to build a vision that is greater than yourself.<p>But the second bit that must be understood is that ""corporations"" <i>are</i> composed of people, just as a marriage is composed of people. These companies are things that people invest time, emotion, and money into to further their goals. When they fail, people feel badly, sometimes really badly about that.<p>If you decide to live in the community of people who build companies from the ground up, or work to make them great, then someone you know personally will commit suicide when they come to the realization that their company has failed and they could have prevented it. I know it is hard to imagine this as a young person who has yet to face their own mortality in any serious way, but please try to understand this scenario.<p>You have been working with folks for 3, 4, 5, or maybe 10 years on building something together. Imagine someone you knew in 6th grade is is now graduating with you in college. There are challenges that you don't think you can overcome, personal hardships that you weather together, shared victories you've achieved. You've shared in people making progress toward their life goals, perhaps they have saved up enough to buy their first house, maybe their kids have made it into an Ivy League college, maybe their kids have married your kids. And now, all of this and more is going to be destroyed. These people, these friends and colleagues, are going to have their lives turned upside down, and some more than others. Some will lose their houses, their kids will be told they have to come home because there is no money for school, reputations will be smeared, and good people who did nothing but great work will be villified by a public which has been fed information in a way that creates the most rage and the least understanding.<p>If you, latinohere, or anyone else reading this, ever get the ""opportunity"" to be standing at that abyss and look into it, you may feel that your own death is actually preferable than having to live with that. Sadly I know friends who decided it wasn't worth it and they ended their own lives rather than live with the knowledge they had led people into a place that turned out not as they had hoped. And in that moment, that moment of decision, do you take this ""deal"" which converts a bad outcome to a slightly less bad outcome. it really comes down to people living and dying. Corporation or not, real people who have to live with themselves the day after and the day after that.",1357661871

That would sort it.</i><p>I tend to agree with this, but: what if we had some other rules in place, not just for software patents, but all patents? Like for instance, anyone who files a patent must also file documentation that they have searched for prior art and either not found any, or have documentation as to why their patent is different enough. If the patent examiner finds prior art that the filer didn't disclose, automatic denial of patent and the filer's privilege to file is revoked for a limited period of time. That and outlawing non-practicing entities from holding patents would probably go a long way to fixing the situation, and might even have a chance of happening.",1357660964

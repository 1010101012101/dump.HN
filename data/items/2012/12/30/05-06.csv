4984846,comment,4984276,4984276,8,0,owyn,,,"Ugh. This city does have some bad housing shortages right now, but this kind of whiny name-dropping i-was-here-first essay doesn't help.  Neither does this epic rant I am about to write, but I'm going to do it anyway...<p>My favorite quote so far:<p>""If San Francisco is swallowed whole by the digital elite, many city lovers fear, the once-lush urban landscape will become as flat as a computer screen.""<p>Lush urban landscape eh? Is that from all the feces on the sidewalks?  Who are these city lovers?  Are they the same NIMBY types who are trying to prevent any kind of night club or live music scene from being established in the city (google the ""War on Fun"" for fun).  Well, that nameless person made up by the author is boring and terrible and they should probably move out to the suburbs to make room for someone who actually enjoys what this city has to offer now instead of what it was back when you couldn't take your kids to the park, a story which you told us yourself!<p>""When I moved to this neighborhood in 1993, just before the first dot-com boom, I avoided taking my two toddlers to the playground across the street from the caf, because local gangs sometimes stashed their guns in the sand.""<p>Yeah... soo.... that's bad, right?  I didn't live here back then but I visited frequently and it was awful! Your fake nostalgia for the grittiness of urban life can go burn in a fire made from hobo shit.<p>Another stupid quote:<p>""The unique urban features that have made San Francisco so appealing to a new generation of digital workersits artistic ferment, its social diversity, its trailblazing progressive consciousnessare deteriorating, driven out of the city by the tech boom itself, and the rising real estate prices that go with it.""<p>Wait, aren't techie types usually considered to be sort of trailblazing and progressive and friendly to the arts?  What the hell are you talking about dude?<p>Okay, rents have gone up in my building by 50% in the last 2 years.  It's bad.  The building, that is.  It's basically been a slum apartment for a hundred years and 3 families do live upstairs from me in one unit.  I WISH they'd move out, because I can hear everything that goes on up there.  Ugh.  We have new employees who are trying to move to the city and there aren't any good options, most of them have ended up in Emeryville or Oakland. I certainly wouldn't recommend my own building. I only stay here because the rent is cheap because I moved here before this current boom.  So here I am taking advantage of the very upside-down rental market that's contributing to the whole problem!  I don't know what the long term fix is besides building a LOT more new buildings, which seems to be happening...  But it's only happening because rents are high enough to justify new construction, which is good for non-tech jobs and city property tax revenue in the long term, right?  Would you rather have a bunch of fenced off city blocks with nothing but empty holes in the ground on market street?  There's a new Draft House Cinema moving into a theater that's been empty for like 20 years two blocks away from McSweeny's.  You don't think that's awesome?<p>Eventually this mini-boom will end and that's going to suck WORSE than what's going on now.  Oh man, it's going to suck.  Maybe rents will go down then, but only if a lot of people lose jobs and move away.  That's not good is it?  In fact, that's a worst case scenario for the city.  The cafe you were sitting in when you wrote that article will probably go out of business too.  Is that what you'd prefer?  Maybe one of those techies who moves to SF this year will invent an alternate fuel generator that runs off baby boomer hand wringing and then we'll all be amazed when you single handedly save the city.<p>Still, until recently there were dozens of empty city blocks that had no development at all on them.  Many stalled projects are in progress now, and it is all going to be high priced brand new luxury stuff.  3 new buildings have been built within a block of my current location in the Mission just in the last year.  Sure, they're small and overpriced, and maybe only rich techie types can afford them but I'm FINE with that.  When the people who can afford it move in to those places, they'll free up space in the dumps they moved out of and things will probably equalize in a couple of years, and that's probably the best case scenario.",1356847187

Generally, one concept or idea will get it's own ad group with an associated array of keywords. An ad group is just a concept or a topic that can be described in different ways by a variety of keywords.<p>Here's an example to illustrate.<p>Suppose you were promoting email marketing software for photographers. This is a discreet concept that can be expressed many ways:<p>email marketing for photographers \nemail marketing for photographer\nemail marketing photographer<p>The single concept, email marketing for photographers would get it's own 'ad group'. Other related concepts such as email list building for photography business are unique enough to merit a seperate ad group.<p>The reason why Adwords is organized this way is to ensure that advertisers are laser-targeted with relevancy.<p>It's in both your and Google's best interests to ensure that your Adwords account is generating as many clicks as possible, and by having separate ad groups you can custom tailor the ads within each ad group to be super relevant.<p>You end up with an army of 'mini sales people' that work 24/7/365.

I gather from the rest of your comment, you're in high school?<p>Yes.<p>Honestly, every time I use a tablet the first thing on my mind is the firmware invading my privacy. The next thing though is input devices. (I'll probably end up flashing cyanogen mod.)<p>Input devices, for most users, and even most developers, are something assumed. For desktop it's keyboard and mouse, for laptop it's keyboard and some kind of mouse-like input device. For tablets it's touch or buttons. For phones it's touch or buttons. (I don't think most tablets that use buttons, like e-readers, are open for development. Correct me if I'm wrong though.)<p>I'm going to reiterate what I've already said before, touch sucks as a universal interface. [0] So my question ends up being ""What peripherals make sense for a mobile device?"". Recently I received a tiny bluetooth keyboard to type on my Nexus 7. That's a step in the right direction, as typing things out with the on-screen keyboard is painful and awkward. (And since a stylus is too slow, smudges up the display...)<p>For a pointer device I am using a capacitive stylus. My current hypothesis is that the dominant paradigm for tablets will be keyboard and pen. Though for delicate tasks such as drawing, a capacitive stylus leaves much to be desired. IMO touch should be, in the majority of cases, a fallback interface for people without peripherals. For most applications it doesn't beat traditional input devices such as pens keyboards and mice of one sort or another.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606002"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606002</a>",1356845034

If you modeled Manhattan redevelopment that way, you'd have good results: the construction of new condos in Manhattan has not appreciably diminished the remaining outstanding supply of people wanting to move to Manhattan. If anything, the opposite: the ""cleaning up"" of Manhattan from redevelopment has increased the demand to live there by more than the new apartments have provided, so the supply/demand imbalance is actually worse than before!

My impression so far, mostly looking at Manhattan redevelopment, is that building high-end condos typically does not reduce prices for other buildings in the area, but rather raises them: the presence of new high-end housing increases demand in the immediate vicinity by more than the new building's own supply provides, assuming the area (like Manhattan or SF) is rather desirable in general terms to begin with. That may be good if you want to raise the housing values in an area (each building provides a multiplier effect that raises the prices of neighboring ones, making the whole area more desirable). But probably not good if you want to lower the prices. Good statistics either way would be interesting, though: are there cases where opening new high-end housing actually lowered the other prices in an expensive urban area? E.g. when new condo towers open in Manhattan, does it produce an observable downward move in prices?<p>(The main point I'm getting at is that demand and supply aren't independent variables: demand for living in an area depends quite strongly on the housing stock in that area, so building more housing stock affects both supply <i>and</i> demand, in possibly complex ways, which need empirical data to tease out.)",1356844046

Supply is being held down. Prices go up.<p>I come from Darwin, a wonderful little city clinging to the northern edge of the Australian continent. About 10 years ago a confluence of factors (expanded Defence presence and the early stirrings of the resources boom) meant that property prices took off.<p>At the same time, the hyper-local nature of politics in that part of the country (each member of parliament in the state-level government represents about 2500-3000 voters) means that infill doesn't happen because the margin of victory is easily less than two or three streets getting angry at you for authorising a new block of flats.<p>So: demand shot up, supply did not. Unsurprisingly, Darwin is now one of the most expensive places in Australia to live. If you can find an unoccupied flat, good luck renting a nice one for a price affordable on a normal middle-class income. And good luck finding a house for a price affordable on a normal middle-class income.<p>Supply and demand. It's the same everywhere for everyone. There are no exceptions. If SF wants to keep its middle class, it needs to make more housing available.<p>Especially high density housing <i>for the wealthy</i>, not the poor. Opening space at the high end of a market can have a disproportionate effect on a total market by removing massive amounts of bidding power. Every rich person who moves into a $2 million dollar apartment is a rich person who isn't bidding the price of an older building up and driving out the middle class, who in turn will drive out the poor.<p>Another dumb policy: giving money for deposits or loans. It just drives up effective demand. Every seller <i>knows</i> you can get the $X thousand dollars and then, surprise, surprise! The price of every house just rose but ~$X thousand dollars. Everything that gets given to the middle and poorer classes to subsidise housing is in fact a wealth transfer to the landlords, via good old-fashioned populist policy making.",1356843924

4984708,comment,4984276,4984515,6,0,_delirium,,,"It's fairly common European cities to be anti-height in the city center for reasons that seem somewhat similar to SF's, though seems less common elsewhere. Some of it is a reaction (sometimes overreaction) to tall modernist housing blocks which nobody really liked. That and other things led to a preference for ""human-scale"" 5-7-story mid-rises. Another factor is a desire for light to be able to hit streets and parks in the ""common areas"" in the city center. A common compromise is to have a mid-rise historical center, but high-rises a bit outside of it, connected to good transit, e.g. central Paris banned skyscrapers after the Tour Montparnasse was so badly received, but there are skyscrapers a short distance away in the ""new downtown"" area of La Dfense. An SF version of that might be to keep central SF mid-rise, but allow high-rise towers near the BART/Caltrain stations in Oakland, Daly City, and Burlingame.<p>The Bay Area's problem is that <i>nobody</i> wants the high-rises: putting them in the center or putting them near transit a bit outside the center would both work, but everyone, except to some extent Oakland, is anti-development, so they go nowhere. Heck, Palo Alto won't even allow <i>mid-rise</i> apartments near the Palo Alto Caltrain, so you actually have people ""reverse commuting"" from SF down to Stanford, because as crazy as living in SF is, trying to live in downtown Palo Alto is even crazier. A few livable, urbanized downtowns on the peninsula might siphon off some of the demand in SF, not solving the problem, but at least reducing it.<p>Other problems that seem like they exacerbate SF's problems: 1) poor intracity transit, e.g. lack of an east-west subway, concentrates demand in a handful of eastern districts; and 2) large areas of the city are not even mid-rise, but full of two-story houses (partly historical, partly anti-development, partly related to #1).",1356843662

For instance, a basic list of what I was thinking of would be:<p>Vertical Search- (Kayak, etc)
User Generated Content- (wikipedia, search wikia, etc.)
Social Networking - (linkedin, Facebook, etc.)<p>Also, I was curious if people had a list of problems that startups are trying to solve.  Such asâ€¦<p>Monetizing Video on the web etc.
Monetizing Mobile Applications
Solving Internet Fraud-  (fraud sciences, etc.)
Etc.<p>Anyway, I was curious if someone could point me in the right direction. Thx",1213055716

Just as Mercedes does great in the small luxury car market and poor in the large consumer market, Apple does great in the small high end market and poor in the larger inexpensive PC market.<p>FYI. Their stock price has gone through the roof over the years. Currently their Market Cap is $160B to GOOG's $175B, and in the past 5 years has far outperformed GOOG.",1213054123

It doesn't make any sense where there are so many things to listen to for free online, everywhere.<p>If NPR publicly tracked all the music snippets used by show/date/time, I'd be buying a lot more music.

Google doesn't seem to support IE6 in the new Gmail interface (the old interface and the HTML-only still work).<p>If you're building a new app and don't have stringent compatibility requirements from your customers (a government contract for a site designed for people who might still run Win98 and use IE5), I don't see any reason to bother with IE6 compatibility anymore. The small number of extra customers you gain is unlikely to be worth the developer time.",1213053010

For example, if a>1 returns 99% of the data - create and store a table with this selection and if someone selects where a>1 AND b>5, query the subset.<p>I don't know.  If I do that, I will end up with GBs and GBs of tables.  I wish there were some magic algorithm to make things 10x faster.",1213052590

I don't like thinking of it as self-publishing (I do intend to try my luck with agents and publishing houses, though). Rather, it's a sort of site for entrepreneurial writers. Your works sell entirely depending on your writing quality and on how well you advertise. The job falls on your shoulders. And you can pay Lulu to help, but come on, that would be cheating. ;-)",1213052414

You're saying that EAX and CCM implementations are so untrustworthy that lay developers should implement their moral equivalents (substituting CBC-MAC and OMAC for HMAC) <i>by hand</i>.<p>In order to use CTR+HMAC, you have to design your own construction to do so. You likely have to implement HMAC yourself.

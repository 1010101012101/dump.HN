7206561,comment,7206090,7206437,4,0,lutusp,,,"> Could you explain more about how self insuring works?<p>In normal insurance, the policy payments go into an investment pool that benefits the corporation&#x27;s stockholders. In self-insurance, the set-aside funds go into an investment pool that benefits you (or your company).<p>The drawback to self-insurance are outlier claims that can more than wipe out the set-aside (as in the case under discussion). Obviously an insurance corporation has (or should have) a larger pool to deal with outliers than an individual or small company.<p>This is not to say that big insurance companies aren&#x27;t sometimes wiped out by a sudden unexpected uptick in legitimate claims. In that case, the company may simply declare bankruptcy and the policy holders are left out in the cold -- just as though they had self-insured. But that&#x27;s a rare occurrence.<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/wrong/index.html#Insurance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/wrong/index.html#Insurance</a>",1391971940

I was interested in how trackable he is.<p>The domain is registered under a fake name and DNS is from Namecheap. It&#x27;s a funny whois entry, lacking all the usual boilerplate, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s Namecheap; some sort of reseller? Doesn&#x27;t match what I see from Namecheap itself,  but Namecheap does take bitcoin now, so it seems plausible.<p>Hosting is libertyvps.net, a bitcoin-paid host. Hosted &quot;offshore&quot;; company appears to be in US.<p>If a US authority leans on libertyvps, they can get an email and blockchain address, and maybe an IP. Tracing the person would be hard if Tor was used for setting up (and using) the email and all host access, and a decently anonymous acquisition of the bitcoin.<p>A US authority could also get to Namecheap. Using the registrar safely requires about the same precautions, notably access via Tor and acquiring the payment BTC (or pre-paid card) in a non-traceable manner. Done right, they could shut the domain down, but not find the person.<p>Anyway, looks like the top-level bases were covered. But there&#x27;s a lot of links in the chain.

When a technology is in its infancy, you get paid more because it is still an evolving space - demand is increasing, but supply is still short (think node right now). Then the technology reaches mass market - cost becomes a factor in whether we write the app in Foo or Bar and rates drop (java). Then, on the tail end of a tech life time (cobol), rates are high again as people retire or move on to the Next Big Thing and supply is low - demand may be low too, but the install base really depends on the tech so will pay a premium.

I learnt to program because I wanted to make things, specifically games. That&#x27;s what kept me typing in those lines and lines of BASIC, that&#x27;s what inspired me to keep learning new languages and technologies - so that I could make better stuff! And this continues to this day. If I&#x27;d been pressured into learning Computer Science instead, I would certainly not be a programmer today.

In the 1990s and even into the early 2000s, it did take skill to get the most out of web servers with clockrates below 200 MHz, maybe 16 MB of RAM if lucky, very limited storage, and limited network connectivity. Specialists were needed in cases like that.<p>What you seem to consider &quot;ignorance&quot; is usually just considered &quot;forethought&quot; and &quot;planning ahead&quot; by those involved. It&#x27;s easy to rail against so-called &quot;premature optimization&quot; until you&#x27;ve seen that kind of prudence prevent unexpected scalability disasters from happening. For a young company, like the kind your friends apparently work at, a little bit of foresight and effort at the start can significantly mitigate the harm that can come from unexpectedly large demand. In some cases this is what will determine whether or not that company survives and thrives.",1391971601

This might sound like a leftist rant, but it&#x27;s actually the singe most important thing to understand about the insurance business.<p>If a policy term doesn&#x27;t contribute to the bottom line, it&#x27;s changed to disfavor the policy holder. If a deductible amount eats too much into corporate profits, it&#x27;s changed to disfavor the policy holder. These facts explain why some companies and individuals choose to self-insure.<p>If you buy an insurance policy, the policy&#x27;s payments go into a corporate investment pool that benefits only the company&#x27;s stockholders.

This was fine with me, since I planned to use headphones.  Unfortunately, the audio output was just as crappy!  It had an insanely high noise-floor!  I had to get a USB DAC/head-phone amp to make things acceptable.  Lesson learned:  Dell sucks at audio.<p>If the speakers in a consumer device like a laptop can be damaged by maxing the volume then the laptop was not properly designed.  This isn&#x27;t a case of a nutty audiophile mixing and matching unknown preamps, amps, and speakers and managing to blow some cones by cranking it to 11.  Dell has complete control over the selection of components in this laptop and, if they cared to, could include circuitry to limit power beneath a point that will damage the speakers.  They didn&#x27;t.  Alternatively, they could eschew a limiter and select speaker components beefy enough to handle the maximum voltage that their DAC&#x27;s can output.  They didn&#x27;t.  Bad design.<p>If Dell did the math and decided the number of users noticing permanent speaker damage would be small enough that the reduced part costs would outweigh the price of the resulting warranty service, that&#x27;s their decision.  However, they should be on the hook to fix damaged caused by their cheap/poor design.",1391971352

7206465,comment,7203042,7205002,2,0,pdonis,,,"<i>what about the current head of US state? How would you know if he/she isn&#x27;t in his best condition?</i><p>But that is, in fact, one of the reasons for the two man rule: so that just one person being insane isn&#x27;t enough. Two people would have to be insane: the President and the Secretary of Defense. That at least provides <i>some</i> reduction of risk.<p><i>I interpret Major Hering&#x27;s question as a separate issue from the &quot;Two Person Concept&quot;.</i><p>At levels below the National Command Authority (NCA, i.e., the President and the SecDef), I agree; the two man rule is just to ensure that, at each level through which the launch order passes, two people have to agree that it&#x27;s a &quot;valid&quot; launch order, where &quot;valid&quot; means it really does come from NCA and it really was issued intentionally by NCA. The two man rule at all those subordinate levels doesn&#x27;t tell the two people to ask whether NCA was sane when the order was issued; that&#x27;s a separate issue.<p>But at the NCA level, as I noted above, the two man rule does add at least some measure of safeguarding against the President himself being insane, because the SecDef has to agree to <i>issue</i> the order in the first place. That is, he&#x27;s not just agreeing that yes, the President really does want to launch nuclear weapons; he&#x27;s agreeing that <i>he</i>, himself, as a separate decision maker, wants to launch nuclear weapons. So if the SecDef is sane, and there isn&#x27;t a sane reason to launch nuclear weapons, he won&#x27;t agree to the launch order, even if an insane President wants him to.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that at the next level down (the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has to receive the launch order from the President and SecDef), they <i>are</i>, as I understand it, supposed to exercise <i>some</i> judgment about whether the order is valid based on circumstances. For example, suppose an insane President fires his (sane) SecDef when the latter refuses to assent to a launch order. There is an ordered list of people who are &quot;next in line&quot; if someone up the chain is killed or is unavailable; so the President calls the next person on the list and asks <i>them</i> to assent to the launch order. However, even if that person agrees (let&#x27;s suppose they&#x27;re insane too), when the two of them transmit the order to the Chairman of the JCS, his first question should be, where&#x27;s the SecDef? I fired him, says the President. Assuming the Chairman is sane, that in itself would be enough to invalidate the launch order; the President can&#x27;t just fire the SecDef--he&#x27;s confirmed by the Senate, and there&#x27;s a formal process that has to be gone through. (The same goes for all the people on the list, btw--they all have to be confirmed by the Senate, and they can&#x27;t be summarily fired by the President without due process.)<p>Of course these sorts of scenarios are the stuff of which thrillers are made (for example, Tom Clancy&#x27;s <i>The Sum of All Fears</i>); but the point is that officers <i>are</i> supposed to exercise judgment. Which does mean that Major Hering was entirely justified in asking the question he asked.",1391970781

Now, I am going to build my own &quot;purchase provider&quot; that just says I paid without ever charging anything. How are you going to stop me from doing that? Somebody would have to authenticate &quot;purchase providers&quot; as actually charging money and paying it to the developer. Either you&#x27;d have to manually embed keys for authorized providers in your app, or trust some third-party to authenticate providers. Either way puts you pretty much where you are now.<p>Then there&#x27;s the matter of developer authentication. Now I build a &quot;purchase provider&quot;, but I&#x27;m an honest one who wants to actually bill the customer and pay the developer. How do I know who to pay? No developer has signed up in my system yet, so I have to use some kind of universal token to identify the developer of an app that somebody is making purchases from and tell them they have money to claim from me. It would have to be email, since what else would work? And we all have seen how secure email is lately. Anybody who managed to put a different address into the app or somehow intercept email to your address could claim the money.<p>Then we have payment splits. The Google app store has a published payment split between themselves and the developer that you implicitly agree to by publishing there. If you had universal &quot;purchase providers&quot; that anybody could implement, who decides what their payment split is? If I wanted my payment provider to split 90% to me and 10% to you, how do you stop that? If we have a third-party doing provider authentication, what are their standards for what payment splits are acceptable?<p>There&#x27;s probably even more issues that I haven&#x27;t thought of yet. If you want to do purchasing like this, you pretty much have to make your own app store and define a proprietary API for it that app developers must explicitly implement.",1391970690

Apparently it&#x27;s possible to pay a programmer $100K/year, but spending ten times that to save the life of one of his employee&#x27;s children is absolutely unacceptable. I&#x27;ll be sure to keep that in mind the next time I hear from an AOL recruiter.<p>The whole point of insurance is that a middle-class family can afford to pay $12,000 or $18,000 in premiums per year, but they can&#x27;t easily afford a $1M black swan medical event. So the insurance company spreads the risk out over a large pool. The system breaks down, of course, if the pool is too small. A company with 10 employees probably can&#x27;t absorb a $1M expense either. But AOL has 5,600 employees and it had $1.05B in net income in 2012. They can afford it to cover expenses, even if they decide to self-insure.<p>Of course, another solution is to make the risk pool as big as humanly possible and to get employers out of the insurance business completely, so that no startup needs to worry about medical expenses. The AMA is a messy political compromise to do exactly that. But Tim Armstrong is also upset about the AMA. So I&#x27;m not quite sure what his ideal outcome is here.",1391969425

I do healthcare analytics for a living so I see how often a single neonatal ICU incident can consume 30% of an entire company&#x27;s healthcare budget for the year (note: if you don&#x27;t really understand healthcare, e.g. what self insuring means, please don&#x27;t respond with comments that the insurance company pays the bills, this is what insurance is for, etc.).<p>The economics of healthcare combined with the inability to have a rational discussion on how to allocate resources means that doctors / researchers will apply their research efforts where they will be rewarded. The race to keep younger and younger babies alive is fueled with ego and dollars.<p>No one wants to talk about scarce resources and how to allocate dollars to have the most impact. I wish conversations stemming from idiotic comments like Armstrong&#x27;s ended up being productive but they always end up with non-actionable ranting around taking executive pay and giving it to sick people.

I installed Secunia on the same computer, and it has not been able to do its update of VLC Media Player, nor have I been able to get an update of that to install by going directly to the VLC Media Player website and downloading the latest version. That is worrisome.<p>Would I be better off just completely uninstalling VLC Media Player?<p>AFTER EDIT: I might have considered a direct answer to my question (whatever the answer was) more helpful than a silent downvote to what was, after all, just a polite response to a question that someone asked me.<p>AFTER FURTHER EDIT: After some more rebooting of the previously infected computer, the operating system and Secunia both report that VLC Media Player version 2.1.3 is installed, and that is not reported to have any problem by Secunia. So I will leave that alone. The computer from which I usually post to HN, a different computer on the same home network, does not have VLC Media Player installed. I try to keep a close-to-bare-stock set of installed programs on this computer, but other users in my household (= teenage boys who aspire to be hackers) tend to install programs I&#x27;ve never heard of on the other computer on our home network, and my wife, who has other things on her mind, occasionally doesn&#x27;t notice installations of crapware or adware or bloatware that tag along with legitimate program updates on that computer. So that other computer tends to be the vector for malware attacks on the home network here.

A friend of mine immediately pointed out to the numerous healthcare privacy laws in place; and another HN commenter pointed out on the original thread the possibility that the employees with the distressed babies would get discriminated against by their coworkers, after Armstrong&#x27;s statements, due to the fact that they&#x27;re probably identifiable internally by their team members.<p>It very well may be a suable violation. HIPAA laws prohibit the &quot;misuse and disclosures of PHI&quot;, and PHI includes a person&#x27;s payment history, not just their medical records[1]. Such a breach by a covered entity is a criminal offence that can result in jail time by the offending employee[2]. As AOL isn&#x27;t a covered entity (e.g. healthcare provider, insurance company, etc), I&#x27;m not sure whether it could be applied directly to Armstrong. You can probably push a HIPAA violation to the insurance company, however, as Armstrong most likely was told of these cases as the basis for group rate spikes during their insurance contract re-negotiation.<p>And those are just justifications related to violating patient privacy laws. I&#x27;m sure a lawyer could also make a pretty strong case against Armstrong personally for defamation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information</a> \n[2]: <a href=""https://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/hipaa-violations-enforcement.page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutio...</a>",1391968833

A least-squares curve-fitting regression method works the same in all languages. A Fast Fourier Transform works the same in all languages. Quicksort works the same in all languages. These examples have in common that they are all expressed in universal mathematical notation, and they all carry out the same basic algorithms in the same way, regardless of which language they&#x27;re expressed in. But all of them would need to be modified to take parallelization into account and exploit it to its fullest.<p>> As far as I know, there have been developments for more than 10 years that aim towards better parallelising compilers.<p>That&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s also true that the real challenges of parallelizing algorithms have yet to be addressed in any meaningful way, for lack of suitable hardware. One example is the problem posed by race conditions among independent processes, which is a big argument in favor of immutable variables and functional languages. But these issues have to be examined in light of specific hardware -- they can&#x27;t be fully worked out in advance of the existence of the target hardware.",1391968832

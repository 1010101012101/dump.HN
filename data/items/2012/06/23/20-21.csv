4151769,comment,4150949,4151607,2,0,berkut,,,"> The garbage collector has nothing to do with things like memory struct alignment.<p>Exactly - that's my point - with garbage collectors you can't do things like align to 16-byte boundaries for SSE, or so they fit in cache lines...<p>> And garbage collector makes concurrent allocation easier, not harder.<p>If it pre-allocates a huge amount of memory (i.e. a memory arena), yes. If it has to allocate the memory from the OS (i.e. it hasn't got any more available to the application), then it's a further painfully slow allocation. Allocating that extra memory is an extra step for the GC language (GC allocates amount at startup, but then when the program executes that isn't enough so needs to allocate more), whereas the C/C++ version can do it all in one allocation.<p>> And garbage collection doesn't prevent stack allocation.<p>I didn't say it didn't, I said Java did.<p>> You seem to have no idea what you're talking about.<p>If you say so.",1340484927

4151766,comment,4150949,4151464,4,0,qznc,,,"Garbage collection is not that bad.<p>Memory allocation being a bottleneck in high-performance applications? I'm not sure what your ""high-performance"" means (HPC? Games?), but profile an application without garbage collection and 80% of the time a significant part of the run time will be within malloc and free.<p>A garbage collector might even be more efficient, since it can delay/avoid the management. When will a GC actually do a collection run? At the moment, when it cannot provide an allocation request from its pool. A program which needs little memory might never hit this barrier. This is like a never calling 'free'. Of course, whether this can be done can only be decided at runtime.<p>There is nothing in a garbage collector which prevents alignments to cache boundaries, preallocation, or stack allocation. In the case of Java the Hotspot JVM can allocate objects on the stack. However, this is a compiler optimization in this case and cannot be directly controlled by the programmer. The upside is that the programmer cannot introduce memory bugs.<p>If you write a game with Java you can allocate a fixed size of memory up front as well. I do not see a problem with garbage collection here.",1340484733

However, my <i>guess</i> is that they did at least the following (which is still creepy, IMHO):<p>- Used phone contacts from the mobile app to use as suggestions. I noticed a serious uptake on weird connection suggestions after I first installed the app a few years back. Checking it out on a proxy, I noticed that it wasn't using SSL, either, so I uninstalled that puppy quick. I assume they've fixed this between then and now.<p>- The ""Find My Friends"" from the Web and Mobile works both ways - so if someone you've emailed in the past chooses to do this, you start seeing them in your suggestions list. If I remember correctly, their original method for doing this was an actual login to email (which may be what happened to you; I don't know if there's any way to get them to clear out those suggestions once you've done it. I contacted Support about this awhile back & couldn't get an answer). What seemed weird to me about this is that all my wedding vendors popped up at the same time as suggestions...like they all got on LinkedIn at once or something.<p>- If you look at someone's profile or they look at yours--even anonymously, you're linked somehow for suggestions.  I've seen people I haven't talked to or emailed in 15 years and three email accounts ago recommended, as well as their spouses(!). Serious privacy issues here if you spend a few minutes thinking about the possibilities. ;)<p>A quick tip--would bet many HN folks already know this, but I've talked to bunches of people who don't: Unless you explicitly set the ""Select what others see when you view their profile,"" option (and keep checking it occasionally - just found mine was reset somehow), anyone whose profile you've viewed can see that you've viewed it. I love this feature (from the who's-viewed-me side, at least), but it's still creepy and something to be aware of if you're LinkedIn stalking someone...<p>Also, it does look like they finally added a ""Security"" checkbox in Settings to always browse using https - would highly recommend setting that one if you haven't already.",1340484463

Two different items - because the same item is being offered by two different sellers. The $9 is Amazon's main one, the $12 is Macmillan's own specified price (note the ""Sold by Macmillan"" in that entry).<p>2.)

In the retail part of Amazon, Kindle books are treated in much the same way as physical items, so the same flexibility of pricing is offered. Physical goods have cost of holding stock and 90-day-invoicing cycles, hence pricing seem to fluctuate based on that 90 day window and items still on hand at payment day.

I get about 20-25 minutes out of the aftermarket battery under normal wind conditions. It's plenty of time to have a lot of fun with, but I'd highly suggest having at least one spare battery to follow-up with for max flight time.

It isn't necessarily about any particular subset of data, or all the plausible abuses of it, it's just the idea that some would rather not have every move they make being recorded and logged into a system they have no information on or ability to influence.<p>More specific to insurance companies, the potential/plausible abuses to increase profit don't take much effort to ferret out. And to make matters worse the data they use will invariable flag a lot of false positives that you'll have little to no way of fixing. For example, my girlfriend regularly picks me up a pack of cigarettes on her way home from work. She usually uses her credit card instead of cash. Ok, now she's flagged in the system as being a chronic smoker and her rates get jacked up to holy hell. Except, of course, she's not actually a smoker and I'd be super skeptical about her ability to reasonably explain this to some random customer service rep over the telephone.<p>Data mining usage habits rarely result in lower prices for people making positive, less risky choices.

THIS would be a value many would pay for.<p>One other thing. I asked my tech-not-so-savvy wife to watch it, and her issue was the frame that said ""this deck took 4 days..."".<p>""FOUR DAYS!!!"" she cried... forget it.  Perhaps you should  frame that ""frame"" better. How long does a deck take to make from start to finish? What's the tech level required?<p>Ideally, a deck should be able to be made from scratch in minutes.",1340481827

It's not okay for the United States government to request (secretly) for a private enterprise to engage in acts that are detrimental to an individual or business because the United States is unable to do anything themselves within the law, however I don't see how the action taken against Wikileaks has any relevance to the action taken against this business. What indication is there that the US requested this?",1340481774

I did testing for about 7 years prior to dev, and my take is that it a) depends on the size of the team and b) a fully fleshed out QA team needs a variety of skills and fills several roles:<p>On the one hand, you need 1) grinders who can do the sort of boring, script driven sorts of regression testing that are essential but difficult to automate.[1] You also need 2) people with a good eye for usability and with a good overview of the system who can provide the sort of feedback Joel mentions. A certain amount of creativity and exploratory skills helps with ad hoc testing and devising test cases. ""I wonder what happens if I push this button and then <i>that</i> one.""<p>Then, 3) someone who can read code and who understand lower level (OS/database) stuff can come up with some interesting test cases that a black box tester may miss. As in, ""what happens to temp files/tables that are created by the app? are they ever deleted?"" And finally, 4) if you can find them, you need someone who <i>can</i> program in order to build test tools and automated frameworks (that's mostly what I did). The goal of the latter being improving the efficiency of the entire team. Finding all of these wrapped in a single person is almost impossible, as #1 tends to be incompatible with the rest.<p>[1] Obviously, if you can automate these in a way that's cost effective, that's preferable, but that's not the typical case.",1264632150

Both of those devices could take full advantage of Apple's closed door policy. The iPod and the iPhone are <i>extremely</i> well built because Apple had complete control over all the parts. All the other phones on the market just felt like cheaper plastic knockoffs. Furthermore, Apple is somewhat lucky that the functionality you'd want from these portable devices is very limited and so Apple didn't miss any of the market by providing such limited functionality.<p>However, devices bigger than iPhone - in the netbook/iPad range - need significantly more functionality. I believe Apple missed the boat with the iPad, especially if it really is targeting grandpa and grandma. People are becoming more tech savvy and they will be less and less willing to shell out money for an inflexible device that only serves a rigid set of predefined functions.<p>The iPad, I'm sure, is constructed extremely well.

You want a short feedback cycle, not because it's the only way your programmers will learn anything, but because you can only improve so much each cycle. The only way to improve the necessary amount is to go through a lot of cycles, preferably in the shortest possible time.<p>Feedback from testers is great, but I've found a bigger reason why I love our QA team. For whatever reason, it's hard to implement something and test it at the same time. It's just hard to make my brain think in both modes at once. It's also hard to test something that I've implemented, because my brain is biased by the thought processes it used during implementation. Trying to think in both modes (implementation and testing) means I'll probably end up doing neither effectively. If you have a great QA team, you don't have to think in both modes. It's great.<p>That hints at his point about letting incompetent programmers do QA. I completely agree with him. A tester thinks differently than a programmer. Hire great testers. <i>So many</i> companies make that mistake.<p>I'm glad to see Joel take a public stand on automated tests, too. Automated tests have their place and their value, but his criticisms of them are completely valid. No amount of automated testing can obviate the need for good human QA.

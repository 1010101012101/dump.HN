6843821,comment,6840430,6843389,2,0,dragonwriter,,,">  There are incentives for teachers to help talented, excelling individuals who have no problems. It makes the teacher and the school look good, especially for local and national government programs that reward teachers/schools with good results.<p>The incentives are actually reversed in the era of NCLB, where the most important measure isn&#x27;t how good the best results are, but what proportion aren&#x27;t meeting the minimum standards for their grade level. This provides incentives to:\n1) Improve the performance of the worst performing students if it is cheap to do, \n2) Get the worst performing students out of the system if it is not cheap to improve their performance,\n3) Avoid accelerated promotion of students that are performing at a higher grade level and not challenged, so as to make the percentages look better.<p>> Actually, there is one incentive for teachers to help troubled kids: High school and college sports. The sports brings in the money, and so they need to make sure the kids don&#x27;t completely fail out so they can keep bringing in the dough.<p>As I understand it, for the most part, high school and college sports bring in money (if at all) for the sports program, not the school at large.",1386111570

The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.</i><p>With bitcoin, you can build services like arbitration on top of the non-reversible payments, and pay for them separately only when you feel that you need them.

Notch never intended it to be moddable and he had no idea at all that modding would be such a big deal for Minecraft. In the very beginning Notch was even (slightly) opposed to modding. I think it was more like a gut reaction: People are doing things with my stuff I didn’t expect and I don’t like it. (Not that he ever even began to consider taking legal steps against it or something awful like that.)<p>He came around to it, though. By the time he handed Minecraft off he was fully in the “modding is great for Minecraft” camp. But the game was never developed for that. A real modding API has been in the works for quite some time now, but it seems to be quite hard to pull that off.",1386110211

I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s something reasonable like the minimum you&#x27;d have to pay to get all the skilled workers you need. Raise your pay offer slowly, gradually attracting more people, until you have the people you need, and that amount of pay is the market rate.<p>But what if that rate of pay is more than the new employees are worth to the company, so hiring them would not benefit the company at all? Then it&#x27;s not a market rate, because market rate isn&#x27;t just the outer edge of what one side finds acceptable. If both sides don&#x27;t find the rate acceptable, there&#x27;s no market rate.<p>If a &quot;greedy&quot; employer refuses to pay what it takes to hire all the people they need, while their enlightened competitor does pay what it takes to get the necessary additional labor, one of those employers will have higher profits than the other, and the one with lower profits will be pressured by their investors to become more like the other.<p>That has been going on for centuries, and the result is a &quot;labor shortage&quot; in some areas, meaning companies (that always face competition from other companies) can&#x27;t get all the labor they want at existing rates and wouldn&#x27;t benefit from additional labor at higher rates. The problem may well be gradually driving the company out of business, but still, raising their wages would just drive them out of business faster.",1386109575

More specifically, it is a quality perceived by humans.<p>Therefore I propose a definition of &quot;intrinsic value&quot;: something that all entities to whom &quot;value&quot; has meaning universally believe has that quality.  For example, oxygen.<p>One could argue that there are entities to whom &quot;value&quot; is meaningful but that do not value either of those things, such as aliens who do not need either substance.  However, since we are not aware of any such entities, it doesn&#x27;t prove this wrong.<p>On the other hand, I suppose a person who is deliberately trying to asphyxiate themselves may not value oxygen after all.

And, (ii) its graphical UI (very much like a &quot;heads-up display”) enables uninterrupted organization and review of pages while users surf.<p>We introduce a twist. We want users to own their own tracking cookie alternative (which is what Been user data can become). We will not share user data with third parties. Instead, Been will facilitate the voluntary exchange of data between users and companies. We think this is a better way, and bookmarking is a good place to start.<p>Been is fully functional regardless of whether people ever choose to share their data with companies. Our alternative to cookies is “merely” a byproduct but an important option that is available whenever users become comfortable with this new approach and companies prepare for a different way to get their message to customers.<p>One more thing, for the month of December, we are conducting 3 weekly drawings for new iPad Mini Retinas for users (“Magic Been Hunt”). Directions are posted @beenpod. To play, you just need to add a designated URL (to be tweeted) to your Been collections by the weekly deadline using our add-on.<p>Thanks!<p>—Dave",1386109140

I currently pay $8/mo for my USPS PO Box, but I&#x27;m wary to send expensive packages there since they have a tendency to misplace packages. So far, they&#x27;ve only lost one package, but there are many times where I&#x27;ll go there and they can&#x27;t locate a package. If I return several weeks later, they managed to find it.<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of one time fees, but I can definitely see myself paying for a monthly subscription plan, similar to Amazon prime.

These years show much more dramatic declines. This is consistent with my hypothesis that state budget cuts are the primary driver of tuition increases.<p>It&#x27;s possible that your point still holds, that the availability of federal loans made it easier for states to cut tuition subsidies. But that&#x27;s a change in the politics of the issue, not a market distortion. Without federal aid, politicians would be more vulnerable to the charge that they&#x27;re making college less accessible.<p>Federal loans have obviously not created a tuition bubble, for the simple reason that the <i>cost</i> of a public 4-year education (the price charged to states + students) is essentially unchanged over the last 25 years.<p>The story may be different for for-profit colleges. If you want to argue that there&#x27;s a market distortion there, essentially that for-profit colleges are gouging students and the government, I could easily be persuaded. But since only 10% of students are enrolled in these schools, they&#x27;re unlikely to be the main source of increasing student debt.",1386109086

If you trust this, don&#x27;t be surprised when law enforcement detects that you&#x27;re using it.<p>I&#x27;m surprised to see someone of Bram Cohen&#x27;s caliber releasing something like this.  No one has any business coding security tools unless they&#x27;ve taken time to read forensics whitepapers to look for reasons why their tool won&#x27;t work.  And this tool certainly won&#x27;t work.<p>The goal of steganography is to hide the fact that you&#x27;ve transmitted messages.  The longer the message, the harder that becomes.  This may be suitable for hiding a few bytes, but no useful message is going to be a few bytes, unless it&#x27;s something like a decryption key (and hiding a decryption key using stego would be crazy).  This doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of &quot;law enforcement wants to know what your decryption keys are, because they&#x27;ve detected you&#x27;re encrypting data.&quot;  The whole point of stego is to avoid that scenario.<p>Anyone who&#x27;s interested in steganography should start here:  <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/jsac98-limsteg.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/jsac98-limsteg.pdf</a> ... No one who reads that whitepaper and understands its implications would take this tool seriously.<p>EDIT:  To clarify:  a message as short as ~50 bytes can often be detected, depending on the stego implementation, because even that is enough to cause statistical anomalies in the covertext which indicates that an encrypted message is hidden in the covertext.  So I&#x27;m not talking about detecting images or videos sent via stego; just encrypted plaintext messages.",1386108872

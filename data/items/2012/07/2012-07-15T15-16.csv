4247200,comment,4246879,4247132,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"Decoupling estimation from scheduling is not something that was invented after the Agile Manifesto.<p>The rule for serious estimators has always been to estimate size <i>first</i> and schedule <i>second</i>. I'm talking wisdom that's been around for decades. Pretty sure Boehm was talking about this as far back as the first COCOMO. It's literally older than I am.<p>I've only ever seen agile use time as a unit of size (the ""ideal day"") and it leads to the sort of trouble you're thinking of: conflation of size estimate with schedule estimate.<p>Non-time estimations might have been expressed in SLOCs, representative ojects, function points and so on. Inputs to estimation could include expert opinion (PERT, Wideband Delphi), historical records and judgement (COCOMO) or early process artefacts such as the number of paragraphs in a requirements document (PROBE).<p>I'm only 31. It shouldn't be the case that I am the ""old fart"" here. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one talking about work, <i>damn good</i> work, that was done before agile came along and apparently hit the memory-flush button on an entire industry.",1342367989

4247194,comment,4246879,4247173,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's not fuzzy. It's unit-less. The number has no size or meaning outside the list of other sizes representing the work for that particular team for that particular sprint. It doesn't transport between teams, it doesn't mean the same thing from sprint to sprint, and it doesn't represent any qualities of the underlying system. You're asking for the definition of something that's just a relative number. It's like asking how long a piece of string is.<p>That sounds whacked, so let me try again.<p>What I'm doing when I take a list of future system behaviors and ask a team to relatively them is creating the parameters to a model that doesn't exist yet. The process of creating, revising, and implementing the model is what the team does each sprint. That's why initial estimates are so whacked (and they should be). Yes, for your particular team on your particular project maybe you get to the end and say ""Hey, on average a story point amounted to 1.5 days"" But I have no earthly idea why anybody would do that or care about that translation. It would a _very bad thing to do_. You only know the ""answer"" once you're done. And the answer is empirically determined by application of the model; it's not a guess.<p>Remember the old quadratic equation? ax^2+bx+c=0? Story points are like knowing ""b"". So how big is ""b""? See? Makes no sense. It's just part of a parameter used to do other things. ""Size"" has no meaning here.",1342367907

Kudos to GW for tackling a massive, difficult problem in the most competitive space in software. Obviously there's still work to be done, but DDG has invested, what, 5 orders of magnitude less into search than Google? This is about as hard as it gets in startup land.<p>I imagine there's a GW post yet to be written [1] on the related point that some problems are harder than others (e.g., search >>> picture-sharing-app), and the complete lack of correlation between effort and value (DDG <<< Instagram, at least so far) [2].<p>But line that I didn't fully understand was:<p><i>I believe distribution is equally important as product. That means quite literally you should be spending 50% of your time on it. For tech people, you should probably bias it to 75% so you end up getting to equal in the end.</i><p>What exactly does ""distribution"" mean in this context?<p>[1] or maybe there already is such a post..

I don't 100% always agree with her politics, but in terms of basic philosophical ideas, her work is a fun and easy way to get acquainted with mainstream classic Western philosophy.

Every day for a decade we had the same 3% of our user base online at peak doing the same transactions as yesterday. Over longer periods, the number crept up and the transaction mix changed, but ""number of simultaneous users"" got me accurate, if not precise, capacity planning from 27 to 1.5 million users.<p>Stress-testing, shared-nothing and dollar-scalable are platonic ideals, and they're not always achievable. If Dropbox had three infrastructure engineers, they probably weren't able to build proper capacity planning models, and probably couldn't afford to build a full production work-alike for stress testing anyway. (And at some scales, that's literally impossible. Our vendors couldn't physically manufacture enough servers to build a full test environment, cost aside.) I'm sure they did some simulated tests as well, but those won't tell you the whole story.<p>You're focused on IOPS, but you have no idea if that's what Dropbox's bottlenecks were. (Not to mention: What does IOPS mean on an EBS and S3 infrastructure?) Complex systems fall over in complex ways. You can predict the next bottleneck, but not the one after that; by the time you get there, your fix for the first bottleneck will have changed the dynamics.<p>It sounds like they <i>did</i> do stress testing, using real-world loads, on a system that was 100% similar to their production system.

only on v.0.8.0<p>- Complete lack of settings, including what I said about the most basic thing, connecting/disconnecting.<p>I had a lot of hopes for this, I use IRC with a few servers and a personal IM gateway (bitlbee), and for now I'm using AndChat which is a very good Android client but the permanent connection makes the battery drain very fast.<p>After having trouble getting the server up (nodejs version and such), I had trouble setting up the servers to connect to, as the settings for creating a new server were different with those of editing the new server, and the password was not even remembered when creating one, so I had to put it again after creating it in the edit mode.<p>But still, no support for identd had me update ZNC and bitlbee to support only server password with ""user:pass"".<p>After I finally got it up, for the first few minutes it was a dream, notifications came very fast, the app was good looking. And then I tried detaching from the server, no way to do that, after I kill the process, notifications still came up, and after ""logging off"" from my server I would still get them!!!! only way to stop was uninstalling the App.<p>Which I did.

4247160,comment,4246742,4246742,12,0,MrFoof,,,"I've downsized a few times over the years.  1080 > 920 > 720 > 660.  How much have I missed having a bigger space?  None.  I could probably drop down to about 550 tomorrow and still have tons of room.<p>The first thing is ""usable square footage"".  In the larger units (> 720) I had things like hallways.  Closets for a water heater or furnace.  Etc.  When I dropped down to 720, I actually had more usable square footage than when I had 1080 square feet.  This is because the smaller spaces were better designed for their intended activities, and other things were inlined or made more efficient (in-line electric water heaters, in-wall thermal pump) as a result of the space constraints.<p>Additionally space isn't to store stuff, it's the support the activities within the space.  When I had 1080 square feet, the kitchen was larger than the bedroom I grew up in.  It meant a lot of unnecessary walking around to get anything done.  When the work triangle shrunk to about 20 square feet, everything was in reach, and I still had tons of room for all the prep work, and an excess of space to store everything.  A 160 square foot kitchen was excessively large when 50 works just as well.  Just like a 50 square foot ""laundry room"" is worthless when there wasn't any room to put an ironing board -- now I have a laundry closet (9 square feet?) with some stacked Bosch units that allow me to get just as much done (with a fold-out ironing board on the door).  The bedroom went from having a 90-square foot walk in closet, to 14 square feet of reach-ins -- of which I use one of them.  I guess if I had a live-in girlfriend she'd use the other.  Bathroom?  Also shrunk.  However the bedroom got larger, as did the main living area.  Big wins.<p>As for stuff I've gotten rid of tons of it.  Every year, clean things out.  Every year, be baffled at home much gets tossed out.  I've zero clutter now, yet I still have everything I care about.  I still have a home-office built into a 15square foot reach-in closet with two 27"" displays and a laser printer that's very comfortable to work in.  I still have some collectibles stashed in a storage bench at the bottom of the bedroom closet.  However if it doesn't have sentimental, monetary, or immediate value, it's gotten tossed at one point. It forces you to think hard about what you value, and stick to it if you don't want to live in clutter or with a giant stack of boxes somewhere.<p>Coworkers always seem to ""feel sorry for me"".  <i>""How do you live without being able to stock up on toilet paper at Costco?""</i>  I guess I don't need nearly as much TP in the bathroom as you do.  <i>""How do you live with such a small car?""</i>  Yeah, a 2-seat roadster is really roughing it, but y'know, I soldier on.  I have everything I want, nothing that wastes my time or attention, less to clean, less space to heat/cool, and a car I drive very sideways.  220 square feet I probably couldn't immediately shift to, but I'm pretty certain I could go to 350 very hastily if I had to.  220 would just require a lot of thought, and giving up activities such being able to host thanksgiving, etc.",1342367151

In this case it worked for them and I continually added information into my ""guest"" account until it was my full fledged account.<p>This might not work for all web services, but I think it works well for stripe.  I honestly doubt I would be using stripe today if they didn't have gradual engagement.  When I was in the market I found stripe during my ""research"" mode.

In the end I felt little friction and I integrated stripe payments into LinkPeek.<p>tl;dr Gradual engagement success appears to depend on the type of person or market a service targets.  Pulling from BCC we could deduce that gradual engagement  may not work well for teachers, or that your implementation did not work well.

Relatively size the things you have to do. Now, <i>without caring about what the points are</i>, select what you can do in the next time-frame. Measure your ability to deliver against this.<p>Over time, your relative estimates get better and your ability to commit gets better. The kicker is that <i>none of this has a damn thing to do with scheduling.</i> Once you can tell reliably tell me you're going to deliver 10% of the remaining total work in the next two weeks, I know for a fact you have  18 more weeks left in the project. Then I can then release plan and work dependencies based on real-world data and without breathing down a developer's neck. Meeting schedules doesn't have to be (and shouldn't be) the higher-stress thing many of us make it out to be.<p>The author seems to not be able to get scheduling out of his head. If you're constantly wondering how many days a story point is, don't use story points. You don't understand them.<p>Note that for such a simple idea, there are several gotchas here. Most teams screw up story points and velocity. Anybody have the PM that divides the points by the sprints remaining  and then announces what the velocity will be? Or how about the ScrumMaster that empirically determines current velocity and then tells the team how many stories they can do for the upcoming sprint? Ouch. Lots of bad practices out there.

4247080,comment,4245737,4245737,3,0,jroseattle,,,"The conversation around programmatic semantics and languages and the like always come and go over time, and feelings about them ebb and flow. Over umpteen years as a developer, I can say that I've found there's something about <i>every</i> language that will cause one to say ""why do I have to think about this like that?"" Nothing is perfect, but certainly a lot of languages do a few things quite well.<p>As such, I would be grateful to hear an argument of why object-oriented programming structures are incorrect. I disagree with the reasons provided by the OP because of the slant toward personal preference. The arguments posted here are specious; I can find holes in each of the points made.<p>1. Data structure and functions should not be bound together - very true, they should be independent. However, this statement: ""Objects bind functions and data structures together in indivisible units."" This implies how something is implemented (or rather ALWAYS implemented), and while a tight binding <i>is</i> possible in most OO-supporting languages, it's not requisite. Just because the ability to violate this exists doesn't make it awful; it just makes it complicit on the programmer to use the right approach in a given situation.<p>2. Everything has to be an object - in some languages, this is true. However, this causes what problems? For the OP, this is nothing more than semantical ickiness. I won't defend any implementation of things like time and date and other primitives, but the chief complaint here seems to be how that information is accessed and the form of which it takes. I simply find the ""this-is-an-object-so-it-feels-wrong"" argument quite lacking.<p>3. In an OOPL data type definitions are spread out all over the place - this is organizational, but I'm not sure what ""find"" means in context. I guess it depends on the language being used, but I question why this is an issue for the OP. ""In Erlang or C I can define all my data types in a single include file or data dictionary."" I can do the same thing in Java or C# or other languages, if I want. For most developers, ""finding"" data type definitions has more to do with documentation than the actual language.<p>4. Objects have private state - of course they do, it's the nature of OOP. This statement: ""State is the root of all evil. In particular functions with side effects should be avoided."" This is unfounded (not the side effects part, which has nothing to do with state.) State, as the OP points out, exists in reality but should be eliminated from programming. Just as the bank example points out, one will want state to be accounted for in cases of deposits and withdrawals from an account. Thinking that state can only be handled in a certain way (which is what this argument suggests) is limiting in evaluation and unimaginative in assessment.<p>Most of the arguments show personal preference to application development, and with that I totally understand. But these arguments are intended to show why the languages which support OO are conceptually wrong, as if the concepts of the alternative are an accepted truism.",1342365159

4247076,comment,4245737,4245737,3,0,phleet,,,"So I have very limited experience with FP, and a reasonable amount with OO (mostly dynamically typed).<p>I can really see the benefits of FP, but there are some problems I have trouble modelling with FP.<p>For instance, if I have a simple 2D rendering engine, I just want to say ""add this object to the screen"". The object might be a geometric primitive (square, circle, etc.), it might be generated particles, or it might be an image or video or something. The way I deal with this at the moment is have Drawable or something to add to the screen with something like, which implements an interface with a ""draw"" method.<p><pre><code>    screen.addToScene(new Circle(...))
    screen.addToScene(new Square(...))
    screen.addToScene(new ParticleGenerator(...))
    screen.addToScene(new ImageSprite(...))
</code></pre>
Then the game would loop over each of the Drawables, then call .draw() on them, which is implemented differently for everything that implements Drawable.<p>How would I model this in FP?<p>The only solution I can think of at the moment is to have a draw function that does pattern matching on the type of thing and do it that way. How do people do stuff like this in scheme or other languages with limited support for pattern matching?<p>The problem I have with this is that it means every time I want to add a new kind of thing, if it implements many methods in an interface, I have to go to many different files to implement how this new kind of thing works.<p>Among other things, that's a huge pain for revision control, since if I have 3 coworkers adding new kinds of things that can be drawn, we're all going to have to modify the draw function. In OO, we'd each just be creating a new subclass in its own new isolated file.<p>As a second question - what should I read to get a good idea of how to sanely model things in OO and FP? I've read a lot of debate about the right way of doing things, but I don't really know where to learn this stuff. The OO class in university was completely useless, since the examples were outrageously contrived and too small to see any real benefits. I'd ideally be looking for 1 book that explains how to model real problems in OO very clearly, and one book for how to model real problems in FP.",1342365051

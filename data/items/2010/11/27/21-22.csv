1945989,comment,1945782,1945782,0,0,rue,,,"Having to assume a timeframe, I do not think you have actually learned the languages. It usually takes years to be really good with one. That is not to say you have learned nothing (exposure to many paradigms is good), but that it takes a lot of effort, may be confusing and that you would probably be better-served by concentrating on one or two and working on actually programming first. The dual nature of languages is that they are nontrivial (at the ""mastery"" level) and they can profoundly affect how you program but that at the same the specific one you end up using is kind of immaterial to programming which is to say composing logic into a functioning program.<p>All of that is a long-winded way of introducing the suggestion that you learn to program by programming. The second-best is understanding others' programs (select well-respected, progressively larger codebases). Books, suggestions of which I hope others will provide, may give you some good ideas and thought patterns. ""Software design"" is a vast field with tons of completely obsolete advice, and terrible amounts of overengineering. Perhaps something like an agile workflow book, ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" once you can construct programs.",1290895149

Different case if you're shipping some scientific equipment worth 1500 dollars now and then.<p>And if that equipment is 50,000 bucks, maybe you start looking at a private courier.<p>I have a friend who used to work as a registrar for a museum, shipping stuff that was worth millions, or even arguably priceless.  She'd ride on the planes and ride in the backs of the trucks that transported this stuff.  She'd have to document every scratch, every discoloration, etc, and sign off on it, before shipping began so they could compare at the end of the trip.<p>But I was suggesting a hedge.  Come up with your own numbers, but if item is worth greater than 2000, insure for 200, costing 70 cents for UPS.  That way it gets UPS internal stickers saying it's insured, probably beeps or something every time someone scans it, and provokes an entirely different attitude than marking it ""FRAGILE"", according to antecdotal evidence.",1290894995

Right and wrong are decided by groups of people, not moral absolutes.<p>Here more people seem to care about freeing knowledge than profiting from it. They see large entities like old IBM, current Microsoft as impediments to progress, overcharging for software, making large profits from business customers and not spreading the benefits of that software or making software poorly suited to the less well off. That's a vague description of the sentiment.<p>Eventually these groups face off in arenas where arguments don't count and someone comes out ahead.<p>It's impossible to stop piracy technologically, lawyers can only threaten or fight little skirmishes for publicity to discourage the general populace from it. Ultimately struggling businesses need to put up more than arguments. It took music companies a long time to get around to that, could have been much smoother with less lawyers and more service.",1290894989

They wouldn't have stood for it.<p>Another problem with working out of someone else's space is that you won't seem as impressive to investors.  Investors often like to visit startups in situ.  You don't seem as real if you don't have your own space.<p>Workspaces seem to fall on a continuum, and it's hard to say precisely where the cutoff is.

How do I find the correlation between those areas?<p>[If we have two stocks S and T whose correlation has to be find, then cor(S,T) = sigma (( S(i) - SA) (T(i) - TA)) / (sigmas<i>sigmat</i>n)<p>S(i) & T(i) are closing prices of the stock on the ith day, SA & TA are the mean prices of the stocks, sigmas = standard deviation of S, sigmat = standard deviation of T and n is the number of the days over which the correlation is to be found - Grabbed from a research paper]<p>Can above info be extended to find the correlation between those 11 key areas?

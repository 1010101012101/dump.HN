And, in fact, your point is more of an argument for a multi-community approach. Don't you think? For example, if you have multiple communities to choose from, you can read about marketing in the morning and about programming in the evening. Whatever you like.<p>Google News is organized this way, and it seems to work.",1192416709
67869,comment,67826,67855,0,0,adsyoung,,,"I'm also very interested to see how something like that would play out. I'm kinda skeptical of any solution that adds complexity to what the user sees though. I'm guessing the more you ask on their part, less people will make proper use of it and click on all the required things appropriately. Then again perhaps thats what you want, only the serious users doing the clicking... We need experiments... <p> ",1192416547

I mean, there's stuff I like, such as astronomy, philosophy, or politics, but would I want to choose a group to limit my discourse there? I like philosophy but I'd hate reading a thesis in the subject. But a little light rationalist vs. subjectivist or philosophy of science reading would be great. Except for those times I'd just like to see pictures of naked famous people. How would these sub-groups come into existence? I just can't see it being topic-based.",1192416362

67863,comment,67826,67853,0,0,waleedka,,,"True; monetization requires big numbers. But why not split them into smaller communities? Rather than one huge home page, have a lot of smaller ones. And, then, allow the user to select the 5 or so that they like to participate in. <p>Restrictions are sometimes good. Compare Facebook to MySpace. With MySpace it's one huge community; everyone can see everyone. With Facebook, you can only join a small set of networks. You cannot even join San Francisco and Silicon Valley at the same time. True, people hate it, but it keeps the system manageable as it scales.<p>This is a subject I'm interested in and trying to build a startup to address it. \n",1192416013

67856,comment,67826,67851,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I have a hard time voting anything up, mainly because I have no idea what I'm signifying.<p>\nI literally have to remind myself go through the news list and comments and vote up every so often -- after I've consumed the material. It's not part of the consumption process for me at all.<p>\nThere have been a lot of stories on YC that I agreed with, but I thought the linked article was poor. And what about good AskYC questions that have no-so-good conversations? Would you vote up the question because it's good, or ignore it because there's nothing of value there for anybody else?<p>\nThis is kind of one of those seemingly pointless philosophical conversations that have a great deal of meaning once they turn into solid solutions.",1192415507
67855,comment,67826,67826,0,0,reidman,,,"Since my YC app deals with this directly, I've been thinking about it a lot. My idea has to do with voting quotes up/down (kinda like Jyte, <a href=""http://jyte.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jyte.com</a> ).<p>In allowing people to vote up/down, I realized that there needed to be a separation between 'Yes this quote is accurate' and 'Yes I think this quote is important', since the two can be exclusive.<p>In the end I decided to implement a two-step process. The first step is to Agree/Disagree with the quote at hand. Once a user has voted in this way, they have an optional second step to vote for how 'Important' the quote is (important or unimportant).<p>I have yet to see how it will work out, but I'd love any comments you guys could provide.",1192415323

The problem with voting, as the reddits realized from the very beginning, is that people will vote something up not just because they liked it, but because they want other people to read it.  And a site full of what the majority want everyone else to read could be significantly less interesting than one full of what people like themselves.<p>And with polls there's not even a pretense that they reflect anyone's interest.

67846,comment,67407,67560,0,0,curi,,,"There are two varieties of bohm interpretation:<p>one says that there are ""hidden variables"". what this means is all particles store information, from the start of existence, about all other particles they will ever have anything to do with. how they store this vast amount of information isn't explained. then, they act on the information. then somehow either this information is used by some physical process to follow the SE (Schrodinger Equation), or they don't bother with that and say the SE is sometimes false for some reason or other. notice all the parts where some explanation is left out. that makes it ridiculous to call this a reasonable alternative to MWI. MWI does flesh out details.<p>the other version -- the pilot wave theory -- says there are special particles that go along one groove of the wave function: our universe. this is a ridiculous attempt to make up some special status for our universe.<p>GRW is about the wave function randomly collapsing when there's enough information flow we might have to face the prospect of other universe-sized-things. why random? b/c that's better than saying ""when we want it to so we can avoid MWI"" and better than copenhagen's ""when people are watching"". how do they try to get away with this? well, mostly universes don't affect each other. so basically any time a universe isn't going to affect ours anymore, a ""random"" collapse occurs, and it disappears. this doesn't break things too too badly b/c ... it's a bit like saying anything so far away we can't see it, doesn't exist. frustrating to disprove. but still ridiculous.",1192413899

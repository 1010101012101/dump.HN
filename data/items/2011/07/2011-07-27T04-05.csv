2810833,comment,2810113,2810798,6,0,redthrowaway,,,"It's an interesting question, though.  If 1000 people tell one person that they don't like them, and the person commits suicide, then it's reasonable to claim that the group drove them to do it.  However, do you prosecute an individual who merely tells someone, ""I don't like you?"" On an individual basis, it's a weak case.  I'm not sure how the law deals with this, or even if there exists any legal principles dealing with how to prosecute actions that are, by themselves, harmless and not illegal (running LOIC may signal an <i>intent</i> to block access, but in the same way that gunning a Pinto on the highway may signal an intent to speed, you're unlikely to be able to break the law).",1311742697

2810822,comment,2810256,2810697,17,0,fpgeek,,,"It is absolutely true that Google has their support issues, and they should be criticized for them, but...<p>Do you seriously think there is any other US provider (i.e. subject to US child pornography laws) that would have behaved any better? Given the allegation, it probably was legally risky for Google to keep his data <i>at all</i>. There are laws that criminalize even the ""innocent possession"" of child pornography. Had things gone another way, I presume Google would have argued they were preserving evidence, but they have to be very, very careful regardless. I'm absolutely certain there are many providers who would have behaved worse (account closed, no comment, no investigation, no appeal, data given to the police then deleted).<p>In the alternative scenario, many of the things you want Google to do could easily be illegal. After an allegation, any warning, contact or access to data could easily have been construed as aiding and abetting a crime in progress and/or obstruction of justice (particularly by an ambitious, headline-seeking prosecutor). What you don't seem to understand is that, once the allegation was made Google couldn't do squat for @thomasmonopoly without risking <i>criminal</i> charges until they determined the allegation was false. And that determination was going to take time no matter how you slice it.<p>Personally, I find it hard to think of what Google could do better in this sort of situation. My two suggestions (and I'm not sure they're practical):<p>1. Commit to manually reviewing every automatic suspension for these kinds of potential criminal allegations.<p>2. Be clear about when an account is being suspended and investigated versus suspended with a final determination made.",1311742222

So while you PROBABLY won't be the target of a lawsuit unless you're very successful, there's a bit of a lottery that happens pretty often with these cases where some small percent of small targets <i>do</i> get run over by the patent holders on the road to the bigger guys.

If you're going to select a small, highly skilled portion of the medical field to analyze, you should compare it to a skilled portion of the software engineering field.<p>Let's draw a more valid comparison: that between cardiologists and graduates of good engineering programs.  Graduates from top CS programs are making significantly more than 58K fresh out of college. The standard offer from Microsoft for a good UIUC CS student is 80K + starting bonus. Conservatively assuming an average salary of 100K over 15 years for the programmer, he is 1.5 million ahead once the cardiologist is finally debt free (12 years of school + 3 years to pay back debt). The cardiologist will then take 7.5 years to catch up, by which time the cardiologist will be in his 50s. I don't know about you, but I'd rather be debt free and making 100K in my 20s, 30s, and 40s, then being the guy on top when I'm 50.",1311742050

2810802,comment,2808800,2808800,1,0,kls,,,"This is really a poorly written article, I try to not be negative about articles but man this one misses a lot of key trends. I agree with the summation of the article companies are divesting themselves of full-time staffed IT personnel and that is not entirely a bad thing many of these people end up becoming consultants and find that they can actually earn more and control their destiny with finer detail. The article seems to wrap everything but developers into consultants which is really not a correct representation.<p>It would better be reflected as 3rd party vendor provided services. Take for example ops they are still needed they have just been shuffled around. Either a company retains a company to do ops or they purchase a managed service that virtualizes and supports everything on 3rd party systems.<p>The work still exists, it has not disappeared rather it has just been shuffled around. One can make an argument about the efficiencies of markets and that a company dedicated to server support can do it more efficiently and with higher quality but the reality remains that that work exist and either through a consultant or an employee it is going to get done. In the end there is still ops work for a dedicated ops person.<p>My second gripe is wrapping project management up into a tech job at all. It is an administrative job plain and simple, it would be nice if project managers had some form of technical background but unfortunately the reality is that most don't. Most that I have met are lost and lean on developers to drag them through the process. To me it is a stretch to even call project managment a technical job. Most technical people don't want the job and most people that take it are not technical.<p>Finally, wrapping everything that gets built under developer is just as broad as wrapping everything else under consultant. There are so many developers with so many specialties and some of them are consultants as well. That the category is almost meaningless, just go ahead and throw developer up under consultant and call it a day. There is really no need for a distinction with both categories being so broad.",1311741750

And due to how incentives are set up, any rational politician will play that meta-game (less they not get elected, and loose further opportunity to affect change).<p>The purpose of letter writing is to attempt to temporarily re-align the rules of the meta-game. The author's idea of a website just to vote on a plan is at its very essence trying to achieve the same goal, to realign interests and rules.

If my servers are in Peru and someone from Texas signs up to use my webserver monitoring service, I am not exactly doing business <i>in</i> the US, am I? I understand if I ship something tangible to the US customers, but with digital goods or services I frankly cannot think of a situation that would reasonably qualify as <i>in</i>-the-US business. All those US customers come to <i>me</i>, not the other way around, so technically the business is being done in Peru.",1311739439

It is so fine that it could be mixed into any drink or put into gel capsules easily. Kratom 15x is one of the strongest forms of Kratom and is active at about half a gram dosage.

Since there is no formal appeals process, you have to harass Google employees in a informal method. Matt Cutts even said on a HN thread that ""Google took the appropriate action"" - So what is it? Did he break the TOS or not?  This is the whole issue. Without a formal process, you just get knee jerk reactions. Any person other than this guy would have stopped trying after Matt essentially said he wasn't getting it back.<p>4: Even after all that, he did not even know why his account was deleted for a week.<p>5: For all Google's talk about data liberation, they suck with this. Takeout only gives you access to useless social crap and if you want to download your email its a long process that involves reading guides, using POP, IMAP, etc.. How about just giving me a link to download my mail?<p>6: No warnings, no contact- This could have all been solved if Google asked first and shot later.<p>* Link to where matt_cutts looked into this and still decided he cant have his account back: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2795465"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2795465</a>",1311739270

Werkzeug and WebOb let you put the exact kind of simple interface on top of WSGI that you are attempting to, but with the benefits of not restricting you to a subset of HTTP, and interoperability with awesome tools like mod_wsgi.",1311739224

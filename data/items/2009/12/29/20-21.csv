If you think that the item adds value, you'll upvote it.<p>In most cases, agreeing with something is a prerequisite for seeing it as adding value. As a consequence, since people mostly upvote what they agree with, one tends to equate upvoting with agreement and downvoting with disagreement.<p>However, according to my understanding, downvoting should be used when you think that the item adds no value (or adds ""negative value""). This is not the same thing as disagreement. Some examples of items that either add no or too little value are: name-calling, snarky one-liners with no useful content at all and very badly edited text (maybe the content has value, but the form negates it).",1262119932

One of the reasons just about any methodology can boast of success stories is that given a concerted, focused and rational effort to improve quality, quality tends to improve, regardless of methodology. Such efforts are quite hard to get right, especially for organizations but when they succeed, there's little empirical evidence the primary cause is the methodology.<p>So if TDD helps frame your own efforts to be a better programmer, by all means, TDD away.

1021166,comment,1020879,1021072,0,0,jws,,,"I believe the ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" keyword phrase comes the standards committee work where Nokia voluntarily promised that any patents relevant to the standards would be licensed as such. (Think GSM, UMTS, and all the cell phone protocols). Remember, just because legalese looks like English doesn't mean it is.<p>In order for standards committees to work without degenerating into a self serving orgy of ""hide the patent requirement"" the players generally agree to this. RAMBUS is a good example of why this is needed.<p>This may come down to: Does Nokia have patents, which are not covered by any of their standards obligations, that Apple is infringing. I expect there are some or Apple would not also have the ""not valid"" card on the table. Apple's pockets are deep enough to fight a patent validity suit.<p>Meanwhile, Nokia will be doing the same in reverse for Apple's patents, except that Apple won't have the ""reasonable and non-discriminatory"" obligation.",1262117085

At the time, it was used mostly for suppressing spam/trolls and egregiously rude people. Now we have flagging for that, although I still occasionally downvote stuff that is rude rather than flagging. Consider it like a minor flag. That said, I'd be fine if it went away and we just had upvotes and flags, but we've discussed this ad infinitum.",1262116990

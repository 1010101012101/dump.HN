89273,comment,88643,89236,0,0,downer,,,"I meant $25m as a dollar figure is a tiny amount when compared to today's acquisition prices (which may follow Angel-only investing) and considering how big a chunk of Google they got for it.  Perhaps that's hindsight, but even at the time it seemed a pittance considering any expected IPO especially in those dot-com days.",1197575521

89271,comment,89183,89183,0,0,Tichy,,,"I actually had more problems with Opera issues than with IE problems. Anyway, I really don't like that kind of thing - companies should be allowed to do shape their products the way they want, and no, Microsoft is not a monopoly. <p>And I am not even an American...<p>Besides the European Commission whatever is definitely a bigger bane than Microsoft ever was.",1197575412
89270,comment,88814,89228,0,0,Tichy,,,"Sure, I was only taking issue with the claim ""In a free market economy there is no such thing as a shortage, by definition"". Let's take food as another example: if there is not enough food to feed all people it doesn't help much that the market will establish a fair price for the food. Some people are still going to starve. <p>In the long run the market might try to provide more food, but perhaps there simply is a limit to the amount of food that can be provided. <p>Likewise for good programmers - maybe the amount of people who are intelligent enough is severely limited? Although I suppose woith 6 billion people, there should be the one or other with sufficient brains...",1197575176
89269,comment,89183,89183,0,0,dcurtis,,,"I think this letter is about 3 years late. <p>IE7 fixes most of the annoying stupid problems that used to drive me crazy; now I can develop a site in Safari and Firefox, and it usually works almost perfectly in IE7. I don't mean to say that IE7 is perfect, just that the problems aren't nearly as bad as they used to be.",1197575170

It's easy to come up with things which poor people want. And web hosting is cheap enough for targeting them to be feasible.",1197575098

89263,comment,89163,89244,0,0,henning,,,"Yes, you definitely can Scalify things. But having to write boilerplate facades for every library you want to use in a nice way significantly diminishes the utility of Java compatibility.<p>I meant to say that this is one of the biggest drawbacks of using Scala (along with slightly immature docs). It has an excellent design; it feels like a much bigger language than Java, yet the Scala spec is a fraction of Java's. It is overall an extremely nice thing.",1197573591

Everyone pretty much associates ""Singularity"" with Ray Kurzweil's vague and strange intersecting-expoential-curves idea which makes no sense (which Eliezer calls ""Accelerating Change"" in the blog post).",1197572758

89253,comment,89200,89200,0,0,dhouston,,,"good stuff. sam altman told us the most important thing for him was to remember #8 -- they need you as much as you need them. they _want_ to believe that you're the next google; think of how much it would make their lives easier if you were, and think of how hard it would be to spend your life saying no 90+% of the time and telling people their babies are ugly. they want to say yes.<p>i'd also say spend a lot of time coming up with a story and framing your opportunity in the biggest possible way. this was something i really underestimated -- initially we'd just show a list of features and expect everyone to arrive at the vision we had in our heads, but really it's the other way around -- the features drive a more important story and vision. <p>a story is also a lot easier for an investor to retell and get other people excited about than a laundry list of ""um, it does this, and this, and this..."" remember, VCs have to then turn around and sell their own general partnership on the idea, so give them the ammo they need to do this effectively.<p>also -- practice your pitch until it becomes mechanical. not so much by standing in front of a mirror (though that helps too) but rather by debugging it with individual angels or mentors, so that by the time you pitch the investors you really want you've already seen most of the universe of possible objections and surprises and can handle them effectively.",1197572661

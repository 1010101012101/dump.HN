Where I am, the amount of lawyers per capita is <i>one tenth</i> of what it is in the US, there's no innate demand for lawyers, so if they start to price themselves too high, demand will fall as people and communities and businesses figure out ways to accomplish the same things as before, but without lawyers.",1355435924

4918319,comment,4918038,4918247,8,0,rayiner,,,"> Technology that simplifies looking up case-law, and that combs through discovery, has greatly reduced the number of lawyers needed.<p>[Citation needed]<p>It's not really the case that demand for lawyers is lower (recession aside). It's that the growth in demand for lawyers is lower than it has been. Remember, we're dealing with derivatives here: the number of new jobs available for new graduates is the derivative of overall legal demand.<p>I don't think technology has had much to do with it, except within certain segments (mainly document review). As technology has evolved, expectations have risen. Yes, you can get on Lexis and quickly look up the case law on an issue, instead of heading over to the library and poring through books, but countering that is the fact that now you're expected to be on top of the absolute latest precedent. It's not enough to give the definition of some element out of a legal encyclopedia. Gotta make sure you review all the cases that touch on the topic to make sure nothing adds a wrinkle that your opponent might bring up.<p>Similarly with document review. Yes, predictive coding will blow through thousands of documents a second, but back in the day you could just interview some people to get the story of what happened. Now you're expected to review every e-mail everyone sent within the relevant time period. Even with technology, someone has to piece those e-mails together into a coherent narrative.<p>What really happened is that during the 1970's and 1980's, the corporatization and financialization of America caused demand for legal services to explode relative to GDP. We seem to have hit a plateau in that process in the late 1990's and 2000's, which has caused the growth in demand to stagnate, and indeed dip in the recent recession.",1355435603

If they had done user testing they might have compromised their lead on the development of touch devices.<p>In response, Nokia used to be open about design & development, using a blog to communicate with their users and gauging their response to certain features. We all know where that ended up.<p>I agree most ideas should be validated before attempting them, but when you have deep knowledge about the industry you're in, you can pinpoint specific pain points without doing market validation.<p>The approach encouraged by Lean et al is a bit naive. Out of politeness, people will often say that your product is great. Others won't make any mental effort into trying your product, and will click aimlessly just to try to please you.<p>I don't advocate big methodological approaches but just sitting down for coffee and demo-ing your product to poorly chosen people does more harm than it helps.",1355435592

<a href=""https://learn.thoughtbot.com/ruby-science-sample.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.thoughtbot.com/ruby-science-sample.pdf</a><p>And here are some counterpoints:<p>Long methods are not as easily testable, but overly short methods can make code much harder to read and follow and actually <i>increase</i> complexity, because now there are many more entry points, leading to excessive nil checking, etc. for those practicing paranoid TDD.<p>Even the developers of Rails are not sold on the promise of the null object pattern, and as it states as almost an afterthought that ""it can lead to confusion"" (paraphrased). If you are a developer, <i>especially</i> one that is a refugee from a more ""type-safe"" language, you are more likely to assume that:<p>an_object.a_method<p>Will fail if an_object is nil/null. By making an_object a null object, then you can end up with is_a?(NullSomething) when other programmers are using your API, defeating the whole purpose of trying to avoid additional try's and other checks in the code. It can be a bad code smell to <i>use</i> null object pattern in many situations.<p>Case statements can be a bad code smell, just as is_a?(...), but not in every situation. Often they can be a clear and concise way to get the job done. In Java the switch statement was ridiculed, only to produce a whole generation of Java developers that either had chained if's or would create 3x the code just to introduce a pattern for simple logic!<p>So, if the rest of this book is like this, please take it with a grain of salt. It is a reference for another way of thinking about things, but if you are going to do that, read ""Design Patterns"" by the GoF and ""Refactoring"" by Martin Fowler also. And then forget all of that and try to write DRY Ruby code in as few lines as possible without tests to get a feel for that. Then give both up and seek a middle ground. In this way, you will be like Bhudda. Neither conservative ""tests, patterns, and refactoring is the only way or you are shunned"" nor liberal ""it doesn't matter how you write it, just write what you like"" are the ways to enlightenment; it is the way between them.",1355435545

Then, when they were called out for it, they launched into pseudo-randian tirades about the unfairness and injustice of it all. They whined about how the governments just kept beating up on the little guy and how they'd stop at nothing to promote the free market.<p>And after all that, this played out the way it should have - there was a vote on the laws that allowed a new behavior.

4918225,comment,4917828,4917828,8,0,agentultra,,,"I think it's rather funny when people talk about the, ""social web."" Before the social graph, technorati, and flickr there were newsgroups, email lists, HTTP, IRC, etc. The Internet itself is a social tool. Perhaps the term refers to some epoch of which I am not aware but it seems to me from a big-picture perspective that we've only narrowly improved the experience since Eternal September.<p>The ""walled garden"" networks will always strive to find their value in lowering the barrier to entry for new participants on the web. Facebook makes it super easy to share your photos with your family and friends and passively update them on the minutiae of your life. Twitter does the same thing to large degree in a more public fashion. Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest... all of the same zeitgeist: user experience.<p>But the cognoscenti are certainly aware that the web is the sum of its parts and walled gardens are antithesis to participation within its ecosystem. However the problem is and has always been participation: there is no single sign-in, no simple user experience, no common parlance for the mainstream to absorb. We got about as far as blogs and stopped there once MySpace, Facebook, et al took over.<p>I'd prefer a return to the roots but I think we'll need software and services that provide a better user experience and product-based focus rather than the service-oriented approach that has become popular.",1355434534

I disagree with many that the ABA should clamp down on accreditation. The AMA did that in the last few decades, and while that guaranteed solid employment prospects for medical school graduates, it also led to skyrocketing salaries and medical costs. I think the medical profession has more goodwill capital to spend with the public in this regard than the legal profession, and any such move would be a very bad idea.<p>However, I do support measures to increase transparency and make educational loans harder to get. In-state tuition at the University of Michigan in 1990 was $6,830 per year (about $11,700 in today's dollars). It is now over $48,000/year.<p>Now, the teaching of law has not changed since Harvard Law School was founded in 1817. You get a bunch of students in a room. You make them read cases from a casebook. You grill them in front of the class on their comprehension of the cases. It's not a high-tech process, but it works, and can be extremely cheap. There is no reason tuitions need to be 4x higher than they were just 20 years ago. The soaring cost of legal education is really the perfect example of how incredibly dysfunctional our higher education system has become. At least with engineering or medical school tuitions you can point to the expense of lab equipment, etc. Not so with a segment of academia where students are taught the same way they have been for two centuries.",1355434518

I think the legally sensible thing to do is to move patents in the direction of being an unfair competition type claim (unfair because you simply copy someone else's technology instead of developing your own).",1355433566

Coding these days ""ain't that hard"" because the current generation of programmers sneer at formal methods. They believe providing even semi-rigorous proofs that their code works is not worth their effort.<p>The result? <i>Testing</i> code with arbitrary input is the best practice; even semi-rigorous proofs are a ""luxury"". Would your high school geometry teacher accept ""well, here's three triangles whose angles sum to 180 degrees. QED.""? Then why are we so content as professionals to provide similar ""proofs"" of correctness?<p>Unfortunately, there's a strong feedback method here. Formal methods receive little treatment because there is little enthusiasm for their application. There is little enthusiasm for their application because the tools aren't advanced enough. The core problem is still the same though: programmers don't take math seriously.",1355432675

I think it is a philosophic/cultural/religious way of thinking about it, but certainly not a scientific one.<p>If morality was the constant of nature you believe it is I don't see any reason why our morality would have changed in the massive ways it has throughout human history and still varies so much around the world.<p>There are still hundreds of millions of humans around the world who hates homosexuals with every bit of their ""soul""/mind, who don't have even a tiny bit of empathy for gays who are killed or tortured. The vast majority of humanity is still eating animal meat, most without much worry about the well being of the animals. Torture is still commonly used and justified around the globe, even by very intelligent Americans [1].<p>Considering how much what we consider moral/immoral varies/has varied through history around the world I don't see any reason to believe it is a constant of nature. It seems muuuuch more likely to me that it is determined by our cultures and societies than by nature, otherwise you would expect to see much greater similarities.<p>[1] Here's a story from a just a few days ago:

That said...<p>The overall way that Ruby is developed causes these issues to happen, because major language experimentation happens very close to feature freeze dates. Because MRI is the defacto-standard (and the ISO standard defines a Ruby which simply does not exist in reality), contention happens because of the lack of coordination between the core Ruby team and the alternative implementers.<p>So for example, something like refinements are controversial because they are very challenging to implement and create all sorts of additional complexity. Under the current way of doing things, alternative implementers would be forced to either implement this feature or to not be able to fully claim they are ""compatible"" with whatever Ruby version they're released in.<p>Matz is generally a good BDFL, and the alternative Ruby implementers are generally very reasonable as well. But the tight time cycles, informal arrangements, and the communication barriers between a Japanese-speaking and Japanese-cultured core team and a more globalized language community combined lead to a lot of heated debates and frequent turbulence.<p>But all that having been said, compromises are almost always made sooner or later and the community moves forward together. They just often come at a high cost, and I wish that cost were lower. After all, the list of things we agree on is miles longer than that which we disagree about.",1355432555

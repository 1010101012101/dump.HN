I take one or two 200mg tablets each day, depending on how I'm feeling (usually just one). I still remember the first few days I was taking Modafinal: I felt like I could see in 360-degrees. I was super alert. That effect wore of quickly. Now, most days when I take Modafinal, I feel alert and ready to work; not perfect but much much better than before. Sometimes the effect doesn't kick-in. When this happens for more than a week in a row, I stop taking it for a few days. When I restart, it seems to kick back in. I see my doctor regularly to make sure everything is okay. I have noticed no strange side effects other than my up-coming Noble prize in astrophysics, my solution to N = NP, and my Sudoku solver written Brainfuck (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck</a>).

Those people ended up helping me to get my first ""real"" job...a job I got fired from for being ""too technical"", but nonetheless, a job which put an immense amount of experience on my resume in a short amount of time. In other words, college sucked ass, but it opened so many doors that I can't be too bitter about it.<p>I guess my true feelings on the matter are as follows: drop out, but make sure you are dropping out because you have an amazing opportunity...not because you don't like it.<p>Oh, and if you do drop out, never say to yourself ""I don't care what anybody thinks of my decision"". You do, and you are lying to yourself. You can't succeed anywhere without a decent subset of people trusting you. If you can earn their trust without a degree, awesome.

I've lived in that world in the past and it can be a minefield.  Designs can change on you overnight and you are screwed.<p>Yes it is a bit of wishful thinking, agreed.  I've been messing with embedded Linux for probably ten years on an off. It was very hard to get close to $100 in OEM board cost as early as three years ago.  So, yeah, this ain't my first rodeo.<p>I posted the ""wish"" to HN because I've been out of the loop for about two years and just didn't know what's available.  The iMX233 @ ~$5.00/100 (not thousand) is impressive enough.  Still, not ethernet without going through USB first.

Keep in mind that this is by buying from the most expensive sources.  I am always pleasantly surprised when I go to Avnet or Arrow for pricing.  Sometimes your jaw drops to the floor. Digikey in particular is just about unusable for anything beyond prototyping.  All of this tells me that the $25 number might be approachable with very smart and careful purchasing of all components and services.  Going to China would certainly knock it down but you'd have to push larger quantities from the get-go.<p>I think I can consider an all-up cost of about $50, in the box and ready to go.

Simply put, the government must gather such information to work in the way that it is told to (we elected almost all of these people, remember). An example of this working properly is search warrants: the government can and will search your private property without your permission, a clear invasion of privacy, but acceptable as it leads to a better justice system. Yes, the government is limited in what it can search, but that power is still held by the government even if the person in question doesn't agree with it.<p>The question shouldn't be about protecting privacy; it should be about being fair with how the government invades it.

555729,comment,555627,555627,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Instead of doing more work with idle cores, why not spread the work out amongst them?  This might provide a net savings in power consumption...<p>Given that technologies like speedstep allow the voltage and frequency of a cpu to be modified dynamically, and that power consumption is governed by P = C<i>V^2</i>f:<p>Say we have a CPU with 4 cores with each core equivalent to a 1.6 GHz Pentium M.  According to Wikipedia, the clock frequency on such a device can be stepped in 200 MHz increments over the range from 1.6 to 0.6 GHz. At the same time, the voltage requirement decreases from 1.484 V to 0.956 V.<p>So, say you have a workload that keeps one 1.6GHz core pegged to near 100%.  Instead, why not spread this work to 3 cores, while lowering the speed to 0.6GHz and the voltage to 0.956V?<p>This would be equivalent to a 1.8GHz machine.<p>Would this save energy?  The original power factor is:<p>1 core * (1.484^2) * 1.6 = 3.52<p>The new power factor is:<p>3 cores * (0.956^2) * 0.6 = 1.645<p>So, about half the power for this example.  Of course, nothing is perfect, and spreading your workload amongst 3 cores will lose efficiency, and gain implementation complexity.",1239339534

Both variants, glue.join(sequence) and sequence.get_joined_by(glue) make some sort of sense, however, neither strikes all readers as the one obvious thing that <i>obviously</i> is right. (Compare similar single dispatch issues like: Will the employee have a add_to_department or will the department have a get_new_employee?)\nThus, I think, the cleanest solution would be a generic method join(glue, string) so you just call join('\n', lines).

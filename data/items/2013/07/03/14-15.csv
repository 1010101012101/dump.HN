This means you&#x27;re tied to their paid support for fixes and improvements. Web servers are pretty critical pieces of infrastructure that are not replaced easily (if you&#x27;re doing large deployments, custom config, etc.) and so having this risk is huge.\n2) Documentation, configurability, support for well-tested integration with various application servers. For example, Nginx supports uWSGI out-of-box. The G-WAN site seems to have limited documentation.\n3) Nginx is well proven in production. Sometimes just being incumbent is a good reason. This often takes some large project or company taking a risk on the platform, proving it in the process; this is unlikely due to #1.\n4) Other benchmarks indicate otherwise in regards to G-WANs performance; not to say its bad, but the selection of benchmarks on its site is likely biased towards it.<p>There may be many other reasons...",1372863496

From the g-wan website:<p>G-WAN is an all-in-one solution because communicating with other servers (FastCGI, SCGI, etc.) takes time (enlarging latency), and wastes CPU and RAM resources when the network can be avoided. Also, supporting many programming languages lets G-WAN serve most needs instead of having to use slower backend servers and fontend caches. Remember that our goal here is to use the ultimate low-latency and resource-saving solution.

Later I started building them from scratch. Now I&#x27;m starting to delve into the higher level &quot;theory&quot; behind making stuff like this. I put theory in quotes because it&#x27;s not really theory, it&#x27;s just observations made over years of experience, approaching theory from the bottom rather than the top.<p>What I learned from doing it that way is that there&#x27;s a level of process abstraction which is higher than &quot;best practices&quot; but lower than pure CS theory. It&#x27;s the level at which documents like 12factor.net are. The best word I&#x27;ve found that describes it is &quot;opinionated&quot;. You want software that&#x27;s opinionated enough to drive design decisions but not so much that it dictates them.<p>People are very proud of this sort of understanding because it is hard-won. When you look at 12factor.net, if you haven&#x27;t been developing for awhile, you might not understand just how useful a document it is. You might be thinking top-down rather than bottom-up. But if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve seen lots of anti-patterns in the things you&#x27;ve built and long for a way to get them out of your apps.<p>That&#x27;s where frameworks come in. They make decisions for you that cut back on those anti-patterns. Very useful if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. When I first started building, I found Rails to be too much bloat, too complex, so I used Sinatra. Now I have a large project that I&#x27;m finishing up, and I wish now I&#x27;d used Rails. You can build an opinionated Sinatra app, but why when you could just use Rails?<p>You don&#x27;t think you need someone else to make decisions for you, until you do.",1372863084

Known terrorist symphasers used this shop as a meeting point in 2013 and 2015 (animal rights terrorists), which puts you with them. You&#x27;re now on a watch list along with 10 million other Americans - no-one is ever taken off the list once they go on.<p>2018 arrives, with a new president who&#x27;s hard on security and terrorism and subversive literature is banned, including some strange titles like the bomb-makers handbook. You&#x27;re not too worried about this, as who would read that sort of thing, right? Unknown to you, one of your students has been reading it, and shared the link to you on a page linked in an email, so that link goes in your file. The student also voices subversive thoughts to you, and you don&#x27;t report them.<p>2020 arrives, and more materials judged subversive are banned, including certain comics judged too subversive and supportive of terrorism. Due to advances in storage tech and analysis, the NSA can now go back to 2014, and every year after, and see exactly what banned information you&#x27;ve been trafficking in, along with analysing documents linked in emails, and your location at every point in your life. 100 million Americans are now on the list, because so many subversives are being found with the new technology. It seems there are a lot of enemies within. The new president is worried and orders more surveillance.<p>2022, and you are pulled in for questioning due to your suspicious profile. No matter how you protest your innocence, it seems no-one will listen - the facts are just too damning, and your lawyer can&#x27;t find you because your arrest was secret. You&#x27;re just another traitor and terrorist sympathiser. You end up in a black site for 5 years, and are released a broken man.<p>The technical advances to make this possible are just developing, but it will soon be a reality, so I do believe we need restrictions on the collection and storage of this sort of information - it&#x27;s just not good enough to leave that decision to the intelligence services, because they will naturally want to keep everything, and analyze everything, and grow their power. We need a check on that power which is not technical but enshrined in law - at present those laws are being ignored.",1372862621

I like that Ansible is not targeting Windows (for now?); The Windows ecosystem is a very different community; with its own mindset and tools, and they&#x27;d prefer to use their own vs. something from Linux-land. This also allows Ansible to concentrate on getting really good on Linux/Unix.<p>Salt stack advantages:<p>+1 (+1 +1 +1) allows you to use Python (with Jinja2 templates) to express logic in configurations. Some people are against this (and tools like Puppet and Ansible try to hide programming from the user), but I feel this is a terrible idea. All that you end up doing is writing a configuration language that&#x27;s Turing complete [joking!]). Some people will say: logic doesn&#x27;t belong in configuration!

The court finding that there was no <i>undue</i> inference made, that any inferences as to guilt that had arisen out of the defendants failure to break silence were allowable.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this really helps so much as it seems as it appears to allow the [partial] curtailment of presumption of innocence.",1372862118

5984737,comment,5984479,5984579,1,0,davidsmith8900,,,"- Well, from my point of view, I DONT THINK IT IS RACIAL PROFILING. I&#x27;m from NYC and racial profiling is crazy up there. Like once a cop sees a black/latino person on the block or at a bodega or corner store, they just search or pat you down for drugs/guns. Some provoke you by calling you names or by punching you in the stomach. You can&#x27;t even walk 2-3 miles without a cop stopping you. It&#x27;s crazy.<p>When I moved to the South (anything below DMV (Delaware-Maryland-Virginia) is the south to me, I &#x27;ve seen cops pull over many people just to check their DL. It&#x27;s called DWB/L (Driving While Black/Latino) Syndrome ~> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_While_Black"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_While_Black</a>. Comparing that to what happens to NYC, I wouldn&#x27;t classify that as racial profiling. The truth is that some minorities drive wild/reckless when they are young. I use to ride my bicycle on the East Side of Town (Minority Side) and I&#x27;ve rode my bicycle on the West Side of Town (Non-Minority) and trust me, on the Non-Minority Side of Town, they are more cautious, considerate and more concerned.<p>The cop probably never saw you in the neighborhood, and from my experience in many Southern Cities, if you are an odd miniority in an &quot;affluent community&quot;, you look suspicious. Cops just drive by slowly as they watch. Other times, I&#x27;ve seen many neighbors or people in a community call something to the attention of cops. It is happened to me, especially at time whenever I entered a bank to get money in the &quot;affluent community&quot;. I would enter the bank without anything suspicious but when I was there, everybody became silent, people looked at me funny and by the time I got out, I saw cops/police cars outside. Might just be a coincidence, who knows?<p>So going back to being a cop, this is what I think. From the cop&#x27;s perspective:<p>1. He never recognized you in the neighborhood.\n2. You are the odd one out in the &quot;affluent community&quot;.\n3. You drove the car, looked at him and went straight for a while (without any destination) before finally going back home, thinking that you threw him off, so if I was him I&#x27;ll be suspicious as well. Or I&#x27;ll think that you were lost.\n4. Then you went back into the car, thinking that he wasn&#x27;t following you, so you decided to go back to what you were doing or earlier planned.<p>FROM THE CONCLUSION UP AHEAD, IF I WAS THE COP, I WOULD JUST FEEL AS IF YOU WERE UP TO NO GOOD AND YOU HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE. MAYBE THAT IS WHY HE ASKED IF YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED, BECAUSE YOU ACTED LIKE A FUGITIVE OR SOMEONE ON THE HIDE OUT.",1372861968

Indefinite, extrajudicial detention of prisoners. Torture. The use of plea bargains to persuade a guilty plea. Use of paramilitary forces (SWAT teams) to apprehend non-violent suspects.

5984565,comment,5979766,5983163,1,0,bhauer,,,"Evab, Gemini is our in-house framework [1] that we&#x27;ve included in these tests for our own learning experience.  We&#x27;re not obsessed with performance, but we do try to avoid problems that are easily avoided.  :)  For instance, where possible, we have used Java&#x27;s concurrent data structures and reduced the use of locks.<p>A difference in these tests is that we have our own connection pool.  Speed was not a main objective when we wrote it--it&#x27;s so old that if my memory is correct, it predates the availability of the connection pool that now ships with the MySQL driver, which is what we&#x27;ve used in the Servlet tests.  Nevertheless, my conjecture is that perhaps it&#x27;s just a tad quicker at selecting an idle connection.  Incidentally, for a while in an earlier round, the Go guys had an alternate test implementation that used a concurrent queue for connections and it performed fantastically.  We&#x27;ve been toying with changing Gemini to do the same at some point.<p>For the benchmarks project, we classified ORMs as &quot;raw&quot; (no ORM), micro, or full.  In Gemini, we have a micro ORM.  The following are examples of its use in the test code [2]:<p><pre><code>    // Get all rows from Fortunes table.\n    final List<Fortune> fortunes = store.list(Fortune.class);\n\n    // Get a random World row.\n    worlds[i] = store.get(World.class, random.nextInt(DB_ROWS) + 1);\n\n    // Run a batch of updates from a List of entity objects.\n    store.putAll(Arrays.asList(worlds));\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Micro ORM&quot; is loosely defined, but we&#x27;ve applied it to ORM options that offer some abstraction over plain old SQL, but aren&#x27;t as comprehensive as the standard-bearers.  For example, while we have a data structure that represents relationships, we do not have a higher-level query language that traverses relationships automatically nor any similar mechanism for easy relationship traversal.  It turns out that across all of these frameworks, there are dozens of what we are calling Micro ORMs.<p>Getting back to your question, the Gemini ORM does leverage a few tricks for performance such as ReflectASM for object creation and prepared statements for queries.  But there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of fancy work going on.<p>It&#x27;s not glamorous, but the most important high-performance elements we make use of in Gemini are the JVM platform and Java&#x27;s concurrent data structures.  As demonstrated by the likes of Undertow (the web server component of JBoss WildFly), mind-boggling performance is available on the JVM.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/framework-benchmarks/p3PbUTg-Ibk/fOjQMxESEJ0J"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/framework-benchmarks/p3PbUTg...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/master/gemini/Source/hello/home/handler/HelloHandler.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/mast...</a>",1372860539

It would be very easy for them to say &quot;We did not refuse the flight last night. Here are the recordings of conversations with air traffic control that proves it&quot;. But apparently they can&#x27;t even confirm whether or not they authorised the flight before or after it had turned back to Vienna...<p>Regarding Portugal:<p>&#x27;The Portuguese Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that Portugal had granted permission for the plane to fly through its air space but declined Bolivia&#x27;s request for a refueling stop in Lisbon due to unspecified technical reasons&#x27;<p>&quot;Technical reasons&quot;? I somehow doubt that Lisbon does not have sufficient capacity to handle an extra plane. And it gets rather academic to grant permission for them to fly through knowing they won&#x27;t be able to safely continue without knowing they have somewhere to refuel...<p>Regarding Spain:<p>&#x27;Bolivia said Spain agreed to allow the plane to refuel in the Canary Islandsbut only if Bolivian authorities allowed it to be inspected. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo denied Wednesday that his country demanded an inspection of the Bolivian plane. \nSpeaking in Berlin, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said authorization was given for the plane to stop and refuel in Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands but that it was important Snowden was not aboard. He said the debate was &quot;a little artificial.&quot;&#x27;<p>So, they were allegedly &quot;allowed&quot; but with some murky, unclear comments that served no purpose unless they are implying there were terms attached. Morales further claims he was approached by the Spanish ambassador in Vienna who allegedly wanted to come aboard the plane with him, and that Morales interpreted it as an excuse to inspect the plane. Makes the whole thing sound to me like Spanish authorities might not technically have refused, but may for example have strongly suggested that &quot;problems&quot; with permits to continue in the right direction might occur if Bolivia did not voluntarily allow someone on board to have a look, or something to that effect.<p>Everyone involved seems to be very concerned about using language that leaves lots of room for them to have actively obstructed the flight, even in their supposed &quot;denials&quot;.",1372860243

I didn&#x27;t mean to be rude.<p>Some titles have PT in them. i assume this means part time.<p>If there were a large number of full time workers earning around minimum wage, I would expect to see a lot of salaries around 20k p/a. Only ~1% of total compensations are between $17-$23k and they all have job titles that can be found above and bell that band. About half have PT in the title and I assume others are something else other than full time.<p>Anyone above that band wouldn&#x27;t be impacted by an increase in minimum wage. Anyone below that band is part time and may be earning near minimum wage, but most probably aren&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with minimum wages. But, it don&#x27;t look like an increase would impact here anyway.",1372860050

They just think they are.<p>&quot;Middle class&quot; has political and functional meanings beyond just &quot;having near-average income&quot;. Nobody living paycheck-to-paycheck, no matter how big those paychecks are, can really function within the middle class.<p>The difference between lower class and middle class isn&#x27;t income, it&#x27;s assets. Because only assets beget independent economic and political power.<p>As recently as mid-20th century, an American talking about being &quot;middle class&quot; would have been referring to <i>ownership</i> of assets. Originally, of course, middle class was anyone who was neither a serf or a noble.<p>If you can&#x27;t afford to tell your employer &quot;fuck you&quot; today, then you&#x27;re a serf, and you have very little leverage.",1372860043

Inevitably there will be some escaping it.<p>But if everyone censors themselves out of fear, then that&#x27;s much more effective of a power for a government to have, since they barely have to do any censorship work themselves. They just need to <i>set examples</i> every now and then to remind people &quot;what&#x27;s waiting for them&quot; if they dare try to expose the truth.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before around here - the most dangerous thing is not the dictator himself. He can be removed <i>if</i>, and only if, the population itself has a free spirit and viciously opposes him, until they remove him.<p>But the real threat is when part of the population starts <i>believing</i> in the dictator&#x27;s &quot;ideals&quot; and principles, and defend his actions &quot;for the good of the people&quot;, and the other part is too scared to say anything anymore. That&#x27;s when a dictator can rule in &quot;peace&quot;, for a long time, and so will his successors, because then, for &quot;his kind&quot;, the environment is very &quot;welcoming&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s a good example of the <i>opposite</i> of self-censorship, and what everyone should be doing:<p><a href=""http://mobandmultitude.com/2013/07/02/the-nsa-comes-recruiting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobandmultitude.com/2013/07/02/the-nsa-comes-recruiti...</a>",1372860042

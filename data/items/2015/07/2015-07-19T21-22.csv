9912977,comment,9911417,9912724,0,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"Regardless of my thoughts on MongoDB in particular, if you are relying upon authentication mechanisms built into infrastructure software so that you can put, say, MongoDB on a public IP address and communicate in the open, you are operating your infrastructure <i>completely</i> unacceptably. There is absolutely zero excuse for not doing this right, and if MongoDB&#x27;s default fucked you here, you&#x27;re not doing it right in the first place. You wouldn&#x27;t put your <i>Nest thermostat</i> on the Internet, so why is your primary data store? And, even worse, if you&#x27;ve &quot;done it right&quot; and thrown HTTP basic authentication in front of it, you get to put your hands on your hips and say &quot;ha! we&#x27;re secure!&quot; but you&#x27;re one bypass or weak password away from losing your entire database.<p>I agree with you on reconsidering MongoDB in production, but administrators failing to secure their systems is not why. Authenticating to a database is an antipattern. Stop making database vendors add this shit: HTTP basic authentication against your NoSQL hotness in prod, on a public IP, is a complete waste of time. Put it in RFC 1918 space or lock down security groups like everybody else and stop losing databases like this. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what&#x27;s unacceptable.<p>Seriously, this stuff is bananas. Now you have to ship passwords around in your automation because you can&#x27;t be bothered to deploy a real DMZ and private network. Then you have to use Ansible Vault or whatever, and the complexity just rapidly multiplies.",1437343104

These names describe a relationship of <i>something</i> to <i>foo</i> and <i>bar</i>. When I read the name I had given it, I thought these were the <i>something</i>s DISCONNECTED from their <i>foo</i>s and <i>bar</i>s but a comment I had written beside each of them informed me that they were the DEFAULT <i>something</i>s of the <i>foo</i>s and <i>bar</i>s.

Breaking the data by area code would allow the elimination of significant chunks of the total possible address space, and further separating (as they do) into dense and sparse would further reduce the requirements (since tries, skip-lists, etc. have their own overhead).<p>It comes down to this: while the Indian phone system could in theory allow 10 billion phone numbers, there are not in fact 10 billion legally-allocatable phone numbers and the rules in place likely effectively reduce the legally-allocatable number to somewhere between 1-3 billion numbers. Dividing based on those rules may both reduce the problem to something requiring less engineering time and simiplify possible marketing-related factors (e.g. selling access/systems targeted only to specific area codes).",1437341234

But abuse is often misrepresented as honesty, and intolerance of abuse is often misrepresented as an inability to accept useful criticism.<p>Anyone who is actually concerned about honesty should be able to recognize the existence of abuse and draw a clear distinction between the two. But if every time abuse is brought up, you pretend that honesty was brought up, accuse the speaker of attacking honesty and mount a defense of honesty without ever acknowledging the existence of abuse, then it is clear that you simply reclassify all instances of abuse as honesty, and are really defending abuse. As a heuristic rule of thumb, that&#x27;s a strong indicator that you are yourself a habitual abuser, because other people don&#x27;t have much reason to defend abuse.<p>Everyone screws up from time to time, but it takes faulty rationalizations to keep screwing up in the face of criticism. If you see a lot of feedback which indicates you are behaving harmfully to others, your first conclusion should not be that the people giving this feedback are against honesty and criticism. You should ask yourself why you so often seem to run afoul of this kind of feedback, and why you are so defensive about it. Attacking people for saying &quot;this thing you do is harmful&quot; is an indication that you yourself are not good at taking criticism.

I&#x27;d spent time on BBSes before/since, and just want to create a usable system.<p>I started out with design work.  I learned JS because I wanted to accomplish a given task... I read a big book (JavaScript Bible, 1st edition iirc), over a weekend, and applied that when I got back to work monday... over time, I became more interested in the backend... SQL, livescript, (now classic) ASP, VB5/6/COM/DCOM, and then C# when it came out.<p>The .com bust, while painful was actually a great learning experience for me.  I knew C# was the next step out from VBScript/ASP, but I was unemployed... I managed to get the cheapest/complete book on C#, and without VS was stuck using the command line interfaces.  It was a really interesting, and challenging experience.  By the time I finally got to use VS2003, I really didn&#x27;t care for it, but VS2005 was decent.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve dabbled in C/C++, F#, Perl, Python, Ruby and a few others... I&#x27;ve had Go on my radar for a while, but haven&#x27;t had a use case for actually trying it yet.  I&#x27;ve also spent the past 4-5 years advocating for NodeJS usage.  I find the development paradigm it offers, and the constructs you can acheive (more functional composition, less classes) are closer to my mindset.<p>In the end I like knowing how different softwares work together, how the data is stored... to some extent, I don&#x27;t really want to know the details down to memory access and drivers.  At this point in my life, I have an understanding conceptually, but practically I don&#x27;t care so much.

Current is defined by the continuity equation<p>Del[J] = - d rho(r,t) / d t<p>(those are partial derivatives). Basically that says that the rate of increase of the charge density inside an infinitesimal box is related to the total current flowing into the box, i.e. if the charge in a box changes, it must have flowed in/out from just outside the box, i.e. continuity (assuming no sources/sinks). Both exist at the same time. In SR, you can look at the relativistic four-current.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re thinking of how a current can flow in a wire, despite the wire having no charge.

Longtime Mozilla contributor Wladimir Palant just published a post a few days ago touching on some of the problems with devtools that he ran into when trying to work with it.[2]<p>The idea with sepsis-inspector is that it should be able to replace Hewitt&#x27;s old DOM Inspector codebase and be stupid simple to extend with third-party viewers.  (For anyone unfamiliar, DOMi has the ability to inspect not just webpages, but e.g. the Firefox UI [and Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey] and extensions as well.)<p>The interface between the Inspector itself and the viewers is nice and modular for the most part.  It&#x27;s basically Unix pipes in GUI form, with a few services for sugaring.  Altogether, this makes its design a good foundation for a generalized inspector framework.  (And I do mean generalized.  Let&#x27;s debug PNGs, PDFs, and Haxe, too, but I&#x27;m not even talking just the Web here.  Want to use it to debug Gnome Shell or your Mono app?  Sure.  I mean, why shouldn&#x27;t we be able to?)<p>Since DOM Inspector, Firebug, and the new Firefox devtools exist, I&#x27;ve focused most of my time on getting the architecture right and then teaching the Inspector how to do some things that those tools can&#x27;t already do, rather than necessarily shooting for parity from the start.  This means that if you download the sepsis-inspector add-on[3] right now, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s missing some things that existing tools can do, but at this point, it&#x27;s just a matter of layering those features on.  There&#x27;s still work to be done underneath, though.<p>The sepsis-inspector&#x27;s dependency on XUL needs to go away, for example.<p>Allen Wirfs-Brock did some research on JS mirrors[4] a few years ago, although nothing seems to have come of it, AFAICS.  Everyone decided to roll their own debugging/reflection APIs, I guess.  But it&#x27;s blindingly obvious to me that something based on mirrors is what needs to be powering our inspectors, and that your chosen inspector should be able to do a lot more tricks than what the current crop of web inspectors can do (including, as I said before, doing more than just debugging CSS, JS, and the DOM).<p>If anyone is interested in collaborating here, you&#x27;ll find that, for the most part, the sepsis-inspector code is extremely well commented for a Mozilla add-on.

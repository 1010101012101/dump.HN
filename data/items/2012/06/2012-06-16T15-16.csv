4120877,comment,4118378,4120176,1,0,robomartin,,,"Thanks for the history lesson!<p>This thinking is, of course, unfortunate.  Any UI can benefit from ideas borrowed from others.  I remember when I was using Irix (Silicon Graphics) heavily many moons ago.  It had some really compelling ideas.  I can't remember most of them but I think one I liked was that the focus followed the mouse, you didn't have to click on a window to give it focus.<p>Yeah, only being able to resize a window from one corner is a pain in the ass.<p>Also, not having a border around a window makes for a fine mess.  Overlap a few terminal windows full of text to see the effect.<p>The irony today is that the the OSX GUI sits on top of Unix.  Which, of course, has supported deep and complex directory structures for a long time.<p>I can see Apple's point in keeping it simple for the typical non-tech user.  No issues with that whatsoever.  Judging from those I know, they don't ever create deep directory structures on their own and probably don't need anything beyond what Finder offers.<p>That said, I firmly believe that advanced users, which includes developers, could benefit from a much more advanced Finder.  A tree structure is only one aspect of this.  For example, in Windows I can very easily tell Explorer to show system files.  You can do that in OSX, but it isn't as simple it becomes system-wide not directory-specific and it pollutes the desktop.<p>Another thing that I find missing is the ability to see your path in a Finder window, you know, one that you can copy and paste into the terminal window or another Finder window.  Another useful feature would be ""Open Terminal Here"".  I've implemented this through an add-on I found and it is fantastic.  This should be standard.  Directory and file sizes without having to use ""Get Info"".  Preview pane.  Create <insert application> file here (i.e: text files). And more.<p>It'd be nice if Apple offered a way to switch Finder to ""Advanced"" or ""Developer"" mode and offer a closer-to-the-metal experience.",1339862181

The Smart Skins not only changed the look of the device (they wrapped around and clipped on to the body), but there was an  Atmel smart card chip embedded in the plastic that would change your wallpaper, ringtones, etc. once it was clipped on.

If it happens country wide, walmart has too much equity sunk into brick and mortar that they can't rapidly restructure. 10% less income from stores across the board mean stores taking losses, means stores breaking even. Lay off staff and you lose more customers. Close stores, and you lose more customers. Even if you close stores, it's going to be 6 months to a year to get the equity back into working capital.<p>If 10% of the population with held taxes. That's 230 billion dollars in unpaid taxes.

Who's being presumptuous?""<p>You are, and in a very ironic way. I never said their codebase had a problem. I don't know anything about their codebase. It might be just peachy.<p>Look at it this way. What if someone was hiring you to build pyramids by lifting each stone using only the narrowly prescribed box of using your own power (since ""that's how we've always done it"" say), they might also say that your focus on horses and pulleys was a wasteful obsession about means instead of ends and that you shouldn't flinch about dragging each stone yourself all day every day. They might think you are just wasting your time tinkering when you should be moving stones instead, but the truth is that your means are the only human way to reach those ends.<p>But again, their codebase might be perfectly fine. The thing is, I don't like to be told that I have to accept that it is before I've looked at it myself. They can have a really good hacker who will keep his head down, pump out code, and not question past decisions, or they can have critical thinking, but not both.",1339859842

I expect that if we legalized other intoxicants they'd mostly displace alcohol, which would actually be a public health win for many currently illegal drugs.

It will need to do one or two features well that Facebook does badly or not at all, and be a means to a particular end.  For example, the original focus of Facebook was to share contact details and let people communicate about events within a relatively small group of people (students in specific universities).  The interesting stuff happened elsewhere; the site merely allowed it to happen more easily.  I don't think that an open/distributed clone of present-day Facebook is going to be enough, which rules out Diaspora and friends.",1339859214

Listening to Chase Adams talk about his experience with Watsi was incredibly inspiring, and similarly the other speakers instill in you a sense of urgency and possibility. I wouldn&#x27;t measure the value of going in information -- in fact much of the information can be found in PG&#x27;s essays and generally online. The value is in lighting a fire under your ass to get started and meet others that feel the same way -- that in itself can change the course of your life.",1407956384

You can&#x27;t ask medical personnel to take major risks with their lives to help a few people with ebola.  If they and their organizations want to continue to render aid, that&#x27;s their choice, but if there aren&#x27;t enough foreign aid resources to set up proper treatment centers with proper quarantine, and when the locals for whatever reason are violating quarantines and putting everyone, other locals and medical staff at risk, then it&#x27;s simply not safe enough.  The only remaining option is to quarantine the afflicted areas.<p>It&#x27;s also only a death warrant if the people in the quarantine zones don&#x27;t observe proper safety.

The only reason I can see for covering the fact that there might not be another leaker, is if they (accidentally?) passed on the documents to somebody else and don&#x27;t want to be legally accountable for that particular transaction. As long as Snowden was the only one moving stuff around, Greenwald and Poitras are mostly in the clear from a legal point of view, they are just reporters; the moment they provide them to third parties, they lose that protected status. However, this would not matter if their aim was just to involve another journalistic outfit like <i>Der Spiegel</i> (unless German law does not provide the same cover to journalism activities as US law), so I can&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d want to have such a charade going on.<p>I personally find much more likely that there is a second (or even third) leaker but they don&#x27;t want to put him/her under pressure, as you say.",1407955383

I mean,  it&#x27;s OK if user experience doesn&#x27;t matter,  but if user experience does matter,  then latency matters,  and if latency matters you find pretty quickly that serialization/deserialization overhead is a big deal -- particularly in a microservices environment where an external request is going to mean a large number of microservice requests happen,  which means data could be serialized/deserialized many times.  If you&#x27;re happy being in the middle of the pack,  go on with JSON,  but if you are playing to win you need something faster (preferably with a framework that means development as easy or easier than JSON)<p>With multiple languages you don&#x27;t just have the problem of training but you have other complexity-multiplying problems.<p>For instance,  one of the reasons why languages like Haskell are always a bridesmaid and never a bride is that they lack a complete &quot;standard library&quot;.  You need a urlencode() and decode function if you write web apps.  If you write your own you may be more concerned with making it tail recursive than making it correct.  I remember how the urldecode in Perl was busted for a decade and never got fixed,  and that&#x27;s a mainstream language.  As flawed as PHP is,  it took off because it had &quot;good enough&quot; implementations of everything web developers need in the stdlib.<p>In a microservices system there tend to be functions similar to urlencode that need to be replicated across the system,  and if these are implemented over and over again in different languages it is inevitable that some or all implementations will be buggy.  If you can centralize these things in one library everybody depends upon,  however,  life is easy and happy.",1407953383

I have been semi-technical for many years but my background is rather bookish: translation and publishing. More recently I&#x27;ve been working as a technical translator at software company. Even though I had tried to learn php at some time, I didn&#x27;t make much progress. But now, I finally understood programming and learnt python. Let me tell you something: it took my work to the next level. For a professional programmer, what I do might seem easy, but learning python has had a real impact in the way I work. I can now, for example, do things like extraction of common words, BUT filtered through a word stoplist and a spell-checking library. Proof-reading is super fast now. I can get all adjectives from a text. And each day I learn more. I want to become a computational linguist, so I can offer new, different services (I feel I MUST to this, specially facing advances in machine translation). But I don&#x27;t think all people must have the same orientation, so I don&#x27;t know if I should say &quot;all translators should learn python&quot;. It works for me, but maybe not for other translators, for example, literary translators.",1407952959

You have to use the API to manipulate the DOM.<p>For example, the C language does not have OOP as a first class citizen. However, you can do OOP in C.

I could solve interesting and new problems every and be given a chance to explore what is effectively the infinite depths of computing at a very technical level.<p>I was really happy initially but as time has went on, I&#x27;ve become more and more aware that customer-facing IT has a lot less to do with solving technical problems, and a lot more to do with solving social problems - Talking to people and setting expectations and bridging a gap between what should actually be done and what the customer thinks should be done....and I&#x27;m not good at that.  I want to solve difficult, technical problems.  I don&#x27;t want my job description to be &#x27;I primarily deal with people and technical competence is secondary&#x27;.<p>So I&#x27;m not there yet, but I feel this experience has helped really carve out what I do want for a career, so I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve had the experience.  If there is one thing it helped define, is the quality of people I work with.  I get to work with awesome people, and if I could find these kinds of people doing a more technically-focused job, that might be the dream.",1407952933

I began working on an app extremely similar to this (down to the Twitter/IRC like notation) due to my own frustration with the inefficiency of taking meeting notes.  I never finished the prototype, but I&#x27;ll share my ideas that I felt were important:<p>* Make integration with outside parties easy (i.e. Don&#x27;t force everyone in the meeting to use the app to get the benefits.)  Allow me to add aliases to meeting member&#x27;s e-mail addresses (i.e. @joe = joe@example.com)  Allow me to e-mail a link to the minutes when the meeting is over to all parties.<p>* Scheduling<p>I should be able to send calendar invites to participants of previous meetings / define recurring meetings.  If I open up the app it should know what meeting I am in by my schedule.<p>* Continuity<p>Many of my meetings are recurring meetings.  At today&#x27;s meeting, I want to review the open/closed items from the previous meeting.  Though I still want a way to delineate what happened in today&#x27;s meeting.<p>* Self-hostable option<p>For legal / contractual / paranoia reasons, I may need to keep my data in-house.  For several of the groups in my company, a cloud-hosted app is a deal breaker.<p>* Plugins<p>I should be able to integrate the user directory with my company&#x27;s LDAP server.  I should be able to promote tasks to real tickets in my project management software.  I should be able to reference items from other meetings.<p>Anyway, good luck with your app!",1407952832

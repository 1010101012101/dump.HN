The documentation leaves much to be desired compared to other PHP frameworks, but it's getting better. I've never had any major complaints about CakePHP and have been using it for multiple personal and school (scientific research) projects. Recently the lead developer and the project manager left the project and started the Li3 project (<a href=""http://li3.rad-dev.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://li3.rad-dev.org/</a>).

Be inspired, yes.<p>But if I take some code/design and integrate it without fully understanding it (I'm discounting in this things which are meant to be used so- modules, plugins, and so forth) I feel like it's intellectually dishonest. Of course I won't understand fully in intricate detail the codestack of an apache module. But view-source is useful as a learning tool: how did they do it, how can I do something similar myself?<p>I'm at a point where examples like this give me a starting point for adapting a technique to my own uses. If I copy/pasted, not only would it be intellectually dishonest-when the customer requests something that would require the infringing block be modified, I'm doing q disservice to my customers: if I don't understand every inch of that code, I'll likely introduce a multitude of bugs and elongate development time unneccessarily compared to if I had written said code myself.<p>Disclaimer: mobile, +5 drinks.",1260508336

No need to meter the power used to know they&#x27;d achieved their goal by a large margin.<p>I found the interview of him I was making my comments from, here&#x27;s the critical 2 paragraphs (<a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1716385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1716385</a>):<p><i>SF The ARM was conceived as a processor for a tethered desktop computer, where ultimate low power was not a requirement. We wanted to keep it low cost, however, and at that time, keeping the chip low cost meant ensuring it would go in low-cost packaging, which meant plastic. In order to use plastic packaging, we had to keep the power dissipation below a watt—that was a hard limit. Anything above a watt would make the plastic packaging unsuitable, and the package would cost more than the chip itself.<p>We didn&#x27;t have particularly good or dependable power-analysis tools in those days; they were all a bit approximate. We applied Victorian engineering margins, and in designing to ensure it came out under a watt, we missed, and it came out under a tenth of a watt—really low power.</i>",1442753822

Closest you&#x27;d get is probably postage stamps. NASA has some stuff archived, but it&#x27;s not the same, it&#x27;s just prosaic designs with stuff like a photo of the crew of a mission.

The house party is more of a place to meet collectively, to get some drinks in 5x cheaper than in a club and talk to people while still sober and in a relatively quiet place, a pre-party really.<p>By the 30s nobody really hits the clubs anymore (at 24 I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped already), plenty of parties at home though but usually there&#x27;s no dancing involved which may tell you something about the nature of the party.",1442753248

Sure, outliers always existed, but they were rare.  Post teens were adults with adult incomes but not adult responsibilities, like kids, for quite a few years, usually.<p>The modern economic strategy of extending childhood by about a decade by extending education and eliminating entry level positions and near elimination of the high school grad career path has all kinds of fascinating economic effect, mostly bad, but one big effect is by the time the advanced degrees and internships are done and someone finally has an above poverty level income and medical insurance and a place to live other than parents house, the biological clock is ringing and if you don&#x27;t immediately start popping out newborns, you aren&#x27;t going to have biological time to do it, thus dramatically limited party culture.<p>So lets say culturally theres a shift from the delay between &quot;I graduated and now I&#x27;m an adult&quot; and &quot;I got a herd of kids and after school stuff to attend and kids sports and ...&quot; used to be a decade and now its maybe two years?  So you&#x27;d naturally expect a decline of maybe 80% in party culture, taking it from dominant activity in the 20s to its basically gone?<p>There is also the biological effect that scenes from the movie &quot;Animal House&quot; look like fun to a teenage brain, maybe not so much to an older brain, so increasing the drinking age and dramatically criminalizing drinking while also socially pushing the mantra often heard on HN that its impossible to socialize (party) without being an alcoholic (which is criminalized) will result in a natural decline in party culture.",1442753240

Mix the poverty of permanent declines in economic standard of living with increasing fines to be &quot;tough on crime&quot; and mandatory minimums and the risk just isn&#x27;t worth it both for the people who hold the party and the drunk drivers who attend, and people with risk taking disabilities are destroyed before the late 20s that the journalist is writing about.<p>Another cultural curiosity is I&#x27;m old enough to have been born into sports nerd dominated culture, but the times they are a changin&#x27; and the journalist is apparently completely divorced from sports nerd culture, doesn&#x27;t know anyone who brings over a couple beers to watch the game with a dozen or so guys, or tailgates.

The rise and fall of RISC designs coincides with a period where CPU and memory speeds were much better matched, and there was an <i>extreme</i> premium on the number of gates consumed by your design, to fit it all in a single economically manufacturable (i.e. small) silicon die.<p>I say &quot;fall&quot; because ARM had an additional advantage, the market which they were targeting couldn&#x27;t afford ceramic packages, only plastic, and they didn&#x27;t have the simulation capability to confirm their 2nd design would hit their power dissipation target (they were in fact using chips from their 1st design), so they were <i>very</i> conservative and hit their target with a very large margin to spare, maybe a factor 10?<p>So with that extra advantage, and a good business model (better than any competitor at the critical times?  Certainly MIPS), they got more and more design wins where power was a consideration.  In 2001 at Lucent I worked on a power constrained monster board that provisioned something like 300 modem lines, it had specialized ADI chips to do the heavy lifting, they were controlled by a bunch of ARM chips, and it had one housekeeping MIPS chip that was standard for these boards.

This is an interesting question and I&#x27;d love to hear more about what you are thinking of.<p>There are two main parts to most machine learning workloads: training and prediction (though in online scenarios they can be mixed).  The training is what tends to be memory intensive, as it involves looking at historical data.  Prediction, especially in real-time, is typically less memory intensive and more suited to your scenario.  It is possible with MLDB to have training and prediction on separate instances to optimize hardware cost.<p>Our focus to date has been on getting large real-world use cases to fit, for both training and prediction, on a single commodity server with decent amounts of RAM (4GB and up), especially for training.  Performance there is good; you can train user scorers or recommenders over hundreds of millions of users with 20 billion historical actions in minutes on a single server.  We haven&#x27;t focused much on the absolute memory footprint and there is some overhead; you will need a server with a good amount of memory, a couple of gigs, to have a pleasant user experience.<p>(edit): The team tells me it will work decently down to 256MB of RAM or so, for carefully designed automated workloads.  For interactive use you will want more RAM.",1442750709

I lived in Virginia for 30 years and if you are walking around on the street with a beer, you&#x27;re essentially asking to spend 4 hours in the &quot;drunk tank&quot; for public intoxication. This will be followed by offering some welfare ($) to the local legal profession to get the charge dismissed or pled down so you won&#x27;t have a criminal conviction for your future employers to ask you about. There are similar laws in many other states and it definitely puts the kibosh on any potential block party you may wish to have. Since moving to Europe I find it pretty awesome to be able to enjoy a beer while I stroll and not worry about being run in so I can fund some lawyer&#x27;s BMW lease.",1442750535

So your stance is that Anthony, the CEO and Founder of Kaggle, is mistaken about the rules and execution of the 2 phase competition that his company is running, even after 8 days of his company communicating back and forth in email correspondence with you?<p>2. In the forum you initially state:<p>""As I have been saying over email repeatedly over the past 8 days, and yesterday on the phone with you and the Sorkin, there is no checkbox to check!""<p>..then later state:<p>""What on earth is a checkbox doing on the submission screen of a two phase competition? There is no ambiguity - there is only a single <i>file type</i> that is valid for the final leaderboard file. Why on earth is your software not smart enough to figure that out?""<p>and later:<p>""I submitted exactly one final submission. At this point the checkboxes should not matter""<p>and in your reply above state:<p>""I did not check a checkbox because I did not believe it applied""<p>While I'm not familiar with all of the intricacies of the competition, conflicting statements like those have me a bit confused over this whole thing.<p>3. $30k is a lot of money, so I sympathize with you for missing out on that given that your algorithm is better than what the final results suggest. That being said, the other entrants that won competed using the same submission process that you did, was it just bad luck that your entry was not accepted in the manner you had expected or why did they not also encounter this submission bug?<p>4. Is this your first two phase competition with Kaggle? Was this competition executed different than other competitions?

5576340,comment,5575707,5575707,55,0,coffeejunk,,,"It is easy to see _why as ""the crazy ruby guy who wrote some scripts and created all this drama around his persona"". Even though _why did indeed write some (very useful) programs, I think this view of him misses the point and probably explains why so many people seem to be puzzled by his newest endeavour.<p>Yes, he wrote some Ruby code, but the code was his least important contribution.<p>_why was the first person to actually create art <i>around</i> and <i>about</i> software. Others before him have used software <i>as a tool</i> in their artistic process, but to my knowledge no one has ever taken coding as the subject of a performance art so intricate and beautiful as the character whytheluckystiff. All his scripts, all his writings, even all his quirky animations and songs show a love and passion for coding as a recreational activity that defies our conventional beliefs about software as a craft & industry.<p>We often hear people in this community talk about elegant code, beautiful code, even code as art. But all these sentiments usually mean art in the form of <i>craftsmanship</i>: We want a shorter way to write the same web app, a more expressive way to create our tests, a more concise DSL for data manipulation. While all of these are worthy goals, they are only a tiny, tiny fraction of what coding really is or at least could be. If something doesn't help us build our MVP faster, it's useless to us. Isn't there more to software than that? Sure, there are people focusing on more esoteric stuff in their free time, writing their own Lisps, exploring different data structures, etc. But all of these activities still follow the same tenets: More efficient is better, smaller is better, better is beautiful. We are in love with perfection and purity, because that is what we (necessarily) strive for in our daily work.<p>_why was different.<p>Similar to how the decadent and symbolist movements of the late 19th century popularized ""Art for Art's sake"", _why devoted his whole opus to ""Code for Code's sake"". His work as a ""freelancer professor"" showed how much he cared about children learning programming as an enjoyable activity, not as a way to increase the supply of professional programmers. He also satirized our obsession with exactly this professionalism that tends to creep into our thinking and permeates our culture. In short, he used his character to show us aspects of software that were largely underrepresented or ignored in most mainstream discussions.<p>Personally, reading the poignant guide was the first time I read a piece of code not to understand the code, but to understand a wonderful story. I still don't know how to program in Ruby, but that doesn't matter. In my opinion the poignant guide never really was about Ruby. It was a wonderfully quirky book that happened to be using Ruby as its language. _why's style is absolutely unique and reflects his approach to coding: It doesn't have to be (what we normally consider) beautiful or clean, but it nevertheless forms a great and intricate experience for the reader.<p>Similarly, today was the first time that I regretted not owning a printer. To see new pages suddenly arrive in the tray to form a crazy and beautiful story must have been magical. Even using only a virtual printer it was wonderful to read the new parts of the book as they arrived and this experience alone made it worthwhile for me. The content itself deserves more than just this quick HN comment though.<p>So, if you want to know why so many people seem to enjoy the works of _why, set aside some time and start to dig through his estate of old stuff. Don't try to find something useful, just let the whole strange collection sink in. As is often the case with art, the subjective experience is hard to put into words as it depends so much on your personal context and the context of the artwork. I have definitely done a shoddy job trying to describe what makes _why special for me, I am not even sure it can be adequately put into words. But if you like things that are absurd, sometimes useless, yet strangely beautiful, then take a closer look at this works.<p>Thank you for everything, _why.<p>--<p>A friend asked me to post this for him.",1366376171

I simply cannot stomach office politics, and I can't tolerate others that do the whole ladder climbing, brown nosing thing around me. The straw that broke the camel's back was when my line manager took credit for my work right in front of me without even batting an eyelid. I observed this type of sociopathic behaviour many times from many people. I literally couldn't believe how many fuck heads there are out there.<p>Here are some benefits that I'm enjoying as a teacher at the moment:<p>1. Great salary. 90k/year in Australia. I've heard that in other parts of the world it can be a low paying job.<p>2. Great working hours. 8:30am - 4pm. 30 mins recess, 50 mins lunch. 7 ""free"" (non teaching) lessons per week (this is equivalent to one day per week) There are lots of teachers that like to play the ""poor me"" card and tell you how they spend every night till midnight grading work. They're either liars, or are terrible at time management. I consider myself a perfectly OK teacher, and I never go past 4pm and very rarely do school work on a weekend.<p>3. <i>14 weeks of paid vacation</i> - I just spent the last 2 weeks doing a garden renovation and got paid to do it.<p>4. No boss. Technically the principal is my boss, but in 3 years I have barely said more than hello to him and, I sometimes go months without seeing him. No line manager either. What I do in my class is my business. I choose the manner in which I deliver content as well as the interesting tangents that we explore.<p>5. No office politics bullshit. Schools have a very flat org structure. If you're not looking at advancing to the admin side of things (deputy/principal) then there is effectively no career path (I consider this a good thing).<p>6. Heaps of time for side projects.<p>7. Varied work. No two kids are the same, no two semester are ever the same. There are always interesting things happening. Sports days, senior formal, camp etc. I recently spend a week visiting work experience kids and got to visit an army base and defence research facility.<p>8. Over the years it's inevitable that you <i>will</i> make a difference in some kid's life. Whether it's helping them through a tough emotional period or helping them make informed life and career goals.<p>There is no way in a million years I could go back to the regular working world. I simply could not give away the <i>complete</i> autonomy and excellent vacation time.<p>In Australia there is a post-grad degree that you can do which will give you a full teacher qualification in just 18 months. Worth seeing if your district offers similar programs.<p>Caveat:<p>1. The school you're at matters. I am at a middle class private school with great kids. I've worked at very tough schools and life sucked, however, some thrive in these conditions.<p>2. The subject(s) you teach matter. Language rich will entail far more reading and giving written feedback which obviously impacts on hours worked. If you stick to Maths and IT grading is far easier.",1366375388

In particular it makes their conclusion highly sensitive to the experience of NZ (which had <i>terrible</i> growth during the brief period it had high debt), which is - admittedly - problematic.  But their chief critic suggests an unusual weighting which is subject to the <i>precise same flaws</i> except in reverse.

Than sensitivity is <i>also</i> problematic, and the inherent correlation of debt loads in sequential years raises questions about the meaningfulness of their results.<p>Professional economists are now debating the question of the best weighting, but if anything Reinhart and Rogoff seem to have the better argument so far.<p>In short:  Their errors did <i>not</i> eliminate their result.

5576190,comment,5564766,5570998,1,0,ZenoArrow,,,"You're projecting your view of Linux package management onto Haiku, when the situation with Haiku is going to be pretty different.<p>For starters, let's start with libraries. To use a concrete example, let's say the Cairo vector graphics library. What happens when a program requires Cairo 1.12.14? The library package gets downloaded. What happens when a second program requires Cairo 1.12.13 (i.e. the previous version)? The library gets stored alongside the newer version, so both are available. What happens when a program has forked Cairo, and requires that version? Hopefully the answer is clear.<p>So in this example we have three versions of Cairo. Seems inefficient right? In some ways it is, but efficiencies can emerge when programs do target the same version of Cairo on our system, as the library will already be ready for new programs to use.<p>It's also important to realise in what ways having these three libraries is inefficient. The only real issue here is storage, as we'd probably be looking at three times the storage space for the Cairo functionality. However, as inefficient as this is, it's still more efficient (from a storage point of view) than each application bundling its own libraries, as with installing the libraries separately there's at least a chance of the libraries being shared.<p>There is an alternative, which is to specify library versions that developers should use and bundle these with the system. This has advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that the functionality available to you is easier to scope out. The disadvantages are that recommended libraries get updated less frequently, so if you wish to use a new version you're either forced to wait or bundle your own library, which brings you back to the inefficiencies you had before.<p>Taking time to reflect, I see now that your issue isn't really with package managers per se, but rather that you dislike the 'rolling release' approach of many open-source projects. It's the shifting target that annoys you, how this gets managed is secondary. Would you say that's a fair appraisal?",1366374070

(No, the sequester really doesn't count.)  Nor did the paper argue strongly in favour <i>of</i> austerity; the authors actually are pro-stimulus, and Rogoff in particular was very concerned over the effects of the Fiscal Cliff.<p>Actual austerity has mostly happened in Europe, where nobody really cared about the paper.  The average German voter has no idea who Reinhart and Rogoff are, and he certainly doesn't care that some model showed that further loans to Greece might be correlated with somewhat lower Greek growth in the future; he's sick of the bailouts, thinks Greeks are congenitally lazy, and is afraid Germany won't get their loans back.  In fact, what has <i>actually</i> happened in Greece is pretty much what Reinhart and Rogoff warned against!  (Debt loads get too high, bond markets freak, growth craters.  It's the most obvious explanation for the correlation Reinhart and Rogoff noted, and it's pretty much exactly what happened in Europe.)<p>Meanwhile, the actual spreadsheet errors changed their results from growth of -0.1% in high-debt countries to 0.2%; an inconsequential change.  Nor is this surprising; the reason nobody looked too closely at the numbers is because they agree broadly with every other paper and model out there.<p>TL;DR:  Reinhart and Rogoff <i>caused</i> austerity?

But in effect they become defensive shields as serving a static file or an in-memory file is less work and can be handled in far greater numbers than doing the work on the backend, and if one cache is attacked users accessing other caches elsewhere in the world continue to get their requests served.<p>If you then place a cache at every point at which your site is surfaced, for example you use DNS anycast to have your front-end appear to be surfaced from every Amazon datacenter and the closest one is nearly always selected... then you've helped stop requests at the first opportunity and to return them from a place which can handle far greater requests.<p>You've increase your network capacity, increased the ability to serve valid requests, and you've prevented all of that traffic reaching the backends.<p>And in doing all of this... placing caches for static resources throughout the world and using DNS anycast to return the cached item from the closest peer... well, you have created a CDN. A primitive one for sure, but it still is one.",1366373123

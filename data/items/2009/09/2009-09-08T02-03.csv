...the scenarios I mentioned benefit from <i>n</i> being the exact same number in PHP version X and then version X+1, X+2, etc.<p>If PHP swaps out both rand() and srand(), backward-compatibility is broken, and along with it some kinds of quite-reasonable code that relied on srand() initializing rand() to give the <i>same</i> deterministic stream of numbers (rather than just <i>a</i> deterministic stream).<p>It might still be worth taking that hit -- I don't have a strong opinion -- but there are good reasons not to break backwards-compatibility, even to improve PRNG quality.",1252378680

810178,comment,809862,809862,0,0,barrkel,,,"The causal model that the writer speaks about, the one economists try to construct, is susceptible to story-telling because such models intrinsically rely on more than just the data for their construction, but the constructor's intuitions about the world.<p>The writer's reductio ad absurdum example of predicting land value based on size of house is illustrative. Producing predictions like ""build smaller houses in rural areas"" to increase their value are only absurd because humans have existing intuitions about why land is so expensive in urban areas. It is a lack of data that makes the naive black box model so poor; its lack of access to human insight.<p>This weakness of statistical predictive models has an exact analogue in economic causal models, though. The intuitions being appealed to do not necessarily need to be based on fact, observation and statistics, or they would be amenable to predictive models too. Instead, at the margins they tend to be politically and ideologically driven, giving ""intellectual backing"" to social and political policy positions that benefit various interest groups.",1252378228

I wrote this comment on his blog:<p>To my mind, this isn't news, but that might be in part because I've worked in my family's grant writing firm for so long. The real issue you're discussing is one of incentives: nonprofits don't have much incentive to measure how well they're doing because funders don't demand that they do, or at least don't as a large group.<p>If the funder is federal, state, or local, the funder doesn't have the resources (or the brains) to really measure effectiveness; if the funder is a foundation, the funder probably cares more about the appearance of doing good than effectiveness.

This is essential to economic growth and will help maintain our global competitiveness,""<p>This is utter crap. There is no reason to run fiber to rural areas where providers lose money. If you care that much about your network speed move to an area that supports the speed you need.<p>They talk about so called gains. But their study is non-scientific so comparing their numbers from year to year is meaningless.<p>They included some territories and not others. Something those territories have in common is that they are islands. It costs alot more to run cable to them, therefore they are naturally going to have slower network speeds.<p>The so called data comes from 'Speed Matters, a site that promotes greater Internet speeds', so the author is basing this article on numbers that come from someone with an agenda and no science. Nice bit of writing.<p>If I were this guy's editor I'd fire him for being to lazy to go out and track down the real numbers and come up with a real story.",1252375494

5317338,comment,5304873,5310221,1,0,brent_noorda,,,"No heap? Hmmm... As the slidedeck pointed out, much time is spent in both allocation and copying of memory, and in practice those things are most often strings. Given that 1) the languages under consideration declare strings as immutable, and 2) the strings enter the system at fixed points (e.g. source code or external inputs), and 3) exit at fixed points (e.g. sent out a socket)....  Imagine a system that does not allow heap allocation or memory copying at all. Just doesn't allow them!<p><pre><code>    var structure = ""dog"" + ""house""
    print structure
</code></pre>
does not need to allocate or move memory. That's how the script languages do it now, but should they? All the really need to do is print ""dog"" and then print ""house"", there's nothing that says those 8 letters need to be ever adjacent in memory.<p>Since it's so darn easy (and sloppy) to call malloc() and memcpy() the script-engine writers are going to keep doing so until they're given a MacrocosmicGod-like environment that won't allow malloc() or memcpy() and so will have to come up with a clever workaround.  maybe it will be something like linked-lists of immutable blocks of memory? Something like ropes? Something smarter than that?<p>Anyway, script-engine writers, please forget that malloc() and memcpy() exist, and see what you come up with. It'll be wonderful. (P.S. I was in the script-engine business for a dozen years and didn't solve the problem, but that's just because I'm not smart enough.)",1362387182

The site seems to be a hardcore feminist outrage blog with a strong prejudice to what they perceive, wrongly, to be the female interest. Even the use of the word ""survivor"" at all is highly objectionable, being a subtle attempt to raise the stakes, as if rape and attempted murder are synonymous.<p>The story itself sounds highly questionable. Even in the same blog post, the details are inconsistent (did she walk back to the cab of her own volition, or was she called?) Where was this jacket and why would she think she ""might"" have left it in the cab? Why would the driver wait until she left and returned to attack her? Why would an uber driver, in full knowledge that they are emphatically on record as having picked up and dropped off a person, basically lock themselves in prison and throw away the key by committing such a crime? Why would they then carry the victim's body onto the property!?<p>Seeing that the police have questioned the driver and not charged him, a more likely explanation might be: Deeply intoxicated underage drinker brought home by uber driver, wrongly believes she left something in cab, falls over and hits her head walking back to it, driver carries her back onto her property, she makes something up the next morning to explain things to her parents. Wouldn't be the first time.<p>Anyway, none of these reasonable objections slow the site down in whipping itself up into a self-righteous fervour as they declare the driver guilty and lament the ""survivor"" ""will not see and has not seen justice in any real sense of the word"".<p>Oops, there I go engaging in ""wildly misogynistic and rape-apologetic discussion"" again!",1362386318

Its a very useful feature, and the security industry should focus on the security problems rather than removing features without thinking about the actually benefits of doing so.<p>Sysadmins with root access should be able to handle a random 8 character or longer password, and that number is large enough for a secure public accessible ssh. If your not a sysadmin or unable to remember a random password, try go with a passphrase like ""correct horse battery staple"". If you have too many machines and thus can't remember passwords, then use a master password locally with a bit larger password and store certs there.<p>To do some math to illustrate the security of a random 8 character long password, someone would need to fill a 100/100 line for several hundred years to get through them all. By that time you should have noticed the constantly full connection, and be happy you haven't died of old age yet even after your 200th birthday.<p>However, 8 character passwords are not the suggested length by security experts. They suggest using a 10 character long password, as that is also secure in the case that your password hash somehow got lost.<p>For the several servers that I have, I have been more worried about the logs from failed attempts than I have been of anyone guessing the password.

Our patching systems first use is right in our office. The same deployment infrastructure that deploys the game to production runs in our office with every commit from a programmer or artist. When someone runs the game client (or one of the in house tools) the patching system syncs up the files to the latest version.<p>For real production clients, there can be several versions between the last time someone ran the game client and the next time. It's easier conceptually to deal with.<p>4) The client is over 100,000 files. Each file is generally quite small which limits the damage of not using an actual diffing solution. The larger files like textures and audio don't diff very well anyway when artists make changes due to the nature of the data formats.<p>5) It was really fast to develop. It's just libcurl.

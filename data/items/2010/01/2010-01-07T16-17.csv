I think I do this all the time (unless I'm misunderstanding).<p>Good post, by the way. I have been thinking about similar things recently and I agree with you. The idea that we'll build up a tower of abstractions that lets us sit on top and do powerful things forever is in some ways a gigantic mistake (q.v. ""The Princess and the Pea""). You can do things with smaller, simpler white-box environments that you can't do with large, complicated black-box ones. Something like this is the principle behind what Alan Kay's group is working on, too. I wonder if the industry will ever absorb this.

This is a general explanation of the attractiveness of small-kernel languages</i><p>The irony here is that small-kernel languages, taking Lisp as the ultimate example, hide <i>more</i> of the machine from the programmer than does a language like C. Because small-kernel languages have abstractions written in the language itself, it means they are not necessarily the best abstractions for the machine. When the language has built-in abstractions which correspond to the machine, I would argue it is <i>then</i> that you are really seeing through your abstraction.<p>This is not to say that I think C is therefore a better language than Lisp. There are more important considerations than the degree of abstraction, such as how expressive your language is for creating abstractions. If it's not expressive enough, like C, that can cause worse problems than not being able to see through to the hardware. On the other hand, if your language is very malleable, you may end up with a different problem, where software drawn together from lots of different libraries all have different abstractions and end up less interoperable than they should be.",1262883268

And your point is entirely correct that a cost-benefit model of evaluating treatments tends to make cognitive approaches to treatment delivered by any person other the patient doing self-help look too expensive (as compared to prescription medicines with very occasional psychiatrist office visits).<p>I've been a lot more interested in prompting discussion of mood disorder treament on HN since one thread a few months ago in which a participant (perhaps using a screen name just for that thread) mentioned having repeated bouts of depression that appeared to be seasonal and were definitely recurrent. That thread had many comments self-reporting the same phenomenon in other HN participants. Then, sadly, a few days later it was announced that a YC co-founder with high HN karma had committed suicide. I hope that if one person's anecdote is ""antidepressant medication X didn't help me,"" the response will be ""maybe your individual pattern of mood disorder is better helped by another medicine,"" rather than ""people should try in all cases to do without medicine."" It does appear to be consistent with the newly reported meta-analysis to say ""people with severe depression should definitely try out medicines under medical supervision while also trying out other therapies"" while people with milder cases of depression may not notice drug benefits much, but may still benefit from other therapies. I agree that people with the hard cases should keep seeking help and not give up. There is help even for those cases, although it is discouraging that the help can't be specified just by a simple blood test or something of that kind.",1262882839

1037321,comment,1037220,1037220,0,0,swombat,,,"I don't think the point of this article is quite warranted. What looks to you like something you could only have figured out in hindsight may well look obvious to someone more experienced. Let's take a couple of examples:<p><i>Yes, getting the founding teams right is hard. I agree there are issues with single founders and there are plenty of issues in quickly-assembled founding teams. No, co-founders who’ve known each other for a decade are not a recipe for success either. I’m not sure one can label the general challenges people have with founding team formation a mistake. How much of that is really in the control of the lead founder at the time of making a founding team formation decision?</i><p>Fights between founders can definitely be avoided. In my case, if I'd read the article which I later wrote on the topic (<a href=""http://danieltenner.com/posts/0005-starting-up-with-a-friend.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com/posts/0005-starting-up-with-a-friend...</a>) it would have saved me a very costly mistake. There are many ways for people to fall out, but with enough experience, I would think that a savvy entrepreneur should be able to render them much less likely and much less harmful.<p><i>Another example of determination that’s typically made ex-post. Just think about all the startups that got caught by the crash in 2008 with too little cash on hand. Had there been no crash, they may have done just fine. Should they be blamed for not seeing the crash? In good times, some of the companies whose CEOs always want plenty of money in the bank are blamed for raising too much money. In 2008 they were geniuses.</i><p>That's also not a fair comment. As far as I understand it, raising large amounts of money isn't a ""here's a bunch of money, do what you want with it"" kind of deal. If you raise $10m, you're damn well expected to put that $10m to work in the near future. I'd be surprised if any VC let you keep that money hanging around for more than 1-2 years tops (except, of course, if a recession suddenly hits). Certainly, during the good times, they'll want you to spend it - on growth, mainly, I believe.<p>So raising too much money is fairly predictable ahead of time: if you don't have solid, worthwhile plans for how you'll spend that money, raising too much money will force you to make up plans for how to spend it, and hire people to implement those plans. Hiring more people than you need will slow you down, and potentially cripple you, so that you wouldn't be able to implement the thing that you <i>did</i> need to focus on (and which perhaps only required 1/10th of the people that you hired).<p>So, on the whole, it seems to me that this article makes an interesting but flawed point. Experience turns hindsight into foresight.",1262881831

(5) Client y asks the server ""Hey, whatever happened to my rename request?"";  (6) Server notices that ""a"" doesn't exist but ""b"" does and replies ""Success"".

1037256,comment,1036979,1037200,0,0,edw519,,,"Hey joshwa, somehow I never even noticed that thread yesterday.  Why?  Because I was up to my earlobes implementing a business intelligence/data warehouse system in a very large SOX-compliant enterprise :-).<p>For current requirements, this solution is excellent.  It is third party software, installed on top of an existing ERP system, that enables the users to extract whatever data they need and build their own reports without submitting a ticket to IT.  Everyone loves the prototypes and is dreaming about the possibilities.<p>So instead of beating up on enterprise life, let me just share a little bit of yesterday, one typical enterprise day:<p>- A 3rd party build just stopped at 98% complete with no error message.<p>- Another build crashed with error messages I had never seen, so I had to open another ticket with our vendor<p>- We ran out of disk space on a volume we didn't know the software was using.<p>- I had to add additional data cleaning functions to remove heretofore unknown control characters in the enterprise data.<p>- I inadvertantly named 44 files with the vendor's own naming convention, so now no one can tell whose files are whose.  We had to reset our standards and rebuild.<p>- Although this vendor has hundreds of installs,  oddly, none of them are SOX compliant.  The controls, audits, and duplication of data needed will more than double the resource requirements.  Worse, I'll have to do an implementation that no one has ever done before with this software :-)<p>- Today we start writing our own tools to handle the SOX compliance and satisfy the auditors.  Some fun.<p>I can go on and on.  You get the idea.  And I haven't even touched upon the usual enterprise culprits: the meetings, the politics, and the lack of project management.  It kinda sucks to have to do triple work to get the same thing done.<p>So whose fault is all of this?  No one's.  That's just the way it is.  Every time I think of a better way to get things done in a large enterprise, someone has 5 good reasons why they are the way they are.  It's wasted energy fighting that.<p>As I've mentioned in previous posts (one example: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=760704"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=760704</a>), I think the long term solution will be to eat away at the soft underbelly of the enterprise one bite at a time, with small apps, nimble software, and cloud computing that augments but doesn't replace (yet) current systems.<p>I continue to ponder YC's RFS #6...<p>[EDIT:  I continue to ponder ""Ideas We'd Like To Fund: Enterprise Software"" whichever number that was :-)]",1262880269

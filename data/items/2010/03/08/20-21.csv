As in, ads are what they are: the site does not really care whether they are useful to the advertiser nor how they affect the user so long as they get paid. An unfortunate attitude to project, particularly when trying to come up with solutions to this problem could be really beneficial. Not that they have an obligation to care, of course.<p>They did at least suggest that a monthly subscription might be forthcoming, so something good might come out of it in the end.",1268081778

The ""x"" has no meaning here:<p><pre><code>    double x = 2*x \n</code></pre>\nSo I'd rather write it like this:<p><pre><code>    double = (2*)\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, there's no need to introduce an arbitrary name like ""input"" or ""numbers"" for this function (part of a Project Euler solution):<p><pre><code>    highestProduct = maximum . map product . concat . map (groupsOf 4)</code></pre>",1268081729
1176400,comment,1175946,1175946,0,0,hristov,,,"First I would like to say that I am only learning Haskell, and have done nothing but toy programs thus far. But the point free style is something that I really do not like about Haskell. It makes code much more complicated for the dubious benefit of saving a couple of keystrokes.<p>For example, take the code from the article:<p>This is without point free style:\nsum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs<p>And this is with:\nsum = foldr (+) 0<p>You have saved a total of 4 keystrokes. And made that line of code look really weird and hard to understand.<p>Thus, now when you look at code you cannot say at first glance how many arguments a function takes. The second line of code looks like sum takes 0 arguments. But you have to look more carefully at the definition of the function, and see that it uses foldr, and know that foldr takes three arguments, but here only two are defined, and then you figure out that someone is using point free style and then you figure out that sum, actually takes one argument that must be a list.<p>And this of course, is a simple example. Here we have a big clue in that the function is defined with zero arguments, and most functions take at least one argument, therefore the function probably uses the point free notation. But for a more complex and longer function, the point free style can very easily confuse someone reading the code.<p>So yeah, I think point free style is one of these annoying features of Haskell, that seem to be put in so that users of Haskell can pat themselves on the back and feel like they are very smart. But in the end it does not add much to the language and makes it much less accessible.",1268081724

1176396,comment,1176294,1176294,0,0,Timmy_C,,,"I also like to tell people what basic SEO is not:<p>1. SEO is not keyword frequency. Although the page you are optimizing needs to contain the search term you are trying to rank for it shouldn't be saturated with that term. The first four words of the <title> tag, the <h1> tag and maybe an <img> alt attribute are a few good places to put a good keyword.<p>2. More links isn't necessarily better. A couple good links from one or two good pages can really boost your rankings more than a lot of links from unimportant websites.<p>3. Meta tags won't help a page rank higher. The <meta name=""keywords""/> and <meta name=""description""/> tags aren't used as ranking factors but it's good to include them because they do signal ""about-ness"" to an engine.<p>Some things that might hurt your SEO are frequent server downtime and site inaccessibility, cloaking by user agent, links from spammy domains and acquiring links from known ""link sellers"".<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors</a>",1268081680

1176331,comment,1176294,1176294,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"0. The zeroth rule of SEO is get your site listed for a search for your site. If your site is bobsfishingtips.com, make sure if someone searches for Bob's Fishing Tips, you get found. This means simply getting at least one real site to link the name of your site to you, or maybe a couple sites if you have some common word like Yelp.<p>1. After that, make sure people link to you with proper anchor text for other keywords. If you want people to search for ""fishing tips"" and find you, then several people will need to link you something like this:<p><pre><code>    This site has great <a href=http://www.mysite.com>fishing tips</a>.\n</code></pre>\n2. The more authority these links have, the better you will do. If you get a very high PageRank site to link ""fishing tips"" to you, you might be immediately first for that query in Google. Or, 2-3 medium links might do it.<p>3. The words you want people to search for need to be used several times on your site. You should have the words ""fishing tips"" on several pages and you should link to your best page on ""fishing tips"" by putting that phrase in your own links to your own pages.<p>4. Also make sure you put the keywords you want searches for in the title of your page, and enclose them in H1 tags or other bold/header tags. This won't help very much, but it's probably worth doing.<p>5. Links don't really help you unless they are from a real domain - a link from someblog.blogspot.com will not help your PageRank much at all. Also, the domain needs to exist for a while to help you - something like a year.<p>6. Good places to get links are from your college and high school newspapers, local newspapers, and anyone else who has  a website that would appropriately cover you.<p>7. Some sites have way more PageRank than you might expect. www.cmu.edu is an anchor site for the link graph, and a link from this site will do wonders for your PageRank.<p>8. Here are some excellent pages on SEO:<p><pre><code>    http://www.localseoguide.com/yelp-seo-analysis-part-one/\n    \n    http://www.localseoguide.com/yelp-seo-analysis-part-two/\n</code></pre>\nYou should also check out Mahalo.com. That site is SEOed within an inch of its existence on Google, so take some tips from them but tread carefully.<p>9. In the end, it really boils down to having authoritative links with the right anchor text linking to you. The rest matters very little.",1268080309

What I did: I taught myself Python and a few APIs I needed for the side project (which was actually a research project, not a startup) during slow periods. I did a bit of research into AI algorithms (on Wikipedia) as well. But I never wrote code for the project at work.<p>If you must steal (""liberate"") time, be very careful not to write any code that you'll need when at work. I'd say 3 rules apply.<p>1. Generally, a company can own what you <i>do</i>, not what you <i>learn</i>. If you're going to steal time, use it to do research and exploratory code (that is thrown away) but keep your product code 100% on your own resources. I'm not saying this strategy is right, nor that it's a fool-proof legal defense, but it beats the alternative (of writing side code at work) which is generally considered both wrong and illegal. As far as I know, there's no legal distinction between reading AI articles on work time and the million other kinds of goofing off that 90% of corporate denizens spend most of their days on.<p>2. Companies want you to work 9-5 because those are your best hours. If you're serious about a side project, then the first thing to do is to figure out if you're a morning or a night person (which is mostly genetic). If morning, start waking up at 4 and use 4-8 for the project. If night, your side project should be done in the evenings. You can only give the side 33% of your work time, but you can give it 80% of your energy by aligning your most energetic hours with your side project time. If you're not serious enough about a side project to make these adjustments, you're not cut out for it.<p>3. If you get a creative ""spark"" at work and must get an idea down, have a legal pad and pen that you own (i.e. not with the company's name on it). Write down your design and implement it later. Poets may lose it if they don't get it down at once, but you're a programmer, not a poet.

I knew they would be of value.<p>I'm not hiring at the moment, but here are some thoughts about your resume:<p>When I read a resume I want to know what value you will bring to my company.  I want to know what you can do, and then I want to see the evidence to support your claims. I want to know why you are going to bring in more money than you cost.  Your CV on your web site has to be generic, I know, but I can't easily see from it what you can do.<p>There are some impressive things there (teaching in Ghana, running your company, etc.) and they will lend support to your claims, but first, what will you do for me?<p>Secondly, I know it's unusual for a senior director of two companies (yes, I run another company as well) but I don't use Word.  Yes, most people who will read your CV will, but it would be nice to have a plain text version, and a PDF version, and an HTML version.  Make some effort to make it easy for people to see what you have to offer.<p>Finally, one of my colleagues just read this and my other comment and said - ""Harsh.""  Yes, agreed.  But still, these are things I believe to be true, and I offer them in the hope that they are of value.  They might not be, feel free to ignore them, but perhaps they will help.  They are offered in that spirit.<p>And I wish you good luck.",1268079049

We need fundamentally gigantic changes in human-computer-human communication to affect the former. The first of these was the internet, of course. What we've been doing with it since its inception are comparative baby-steps - someday, perhaps soon, there will be a leap just as big as the Internet is.<p>And it will be fundamentally destabilizing to everything we know as society today.",1268079044

Obviously I'm not saying to do anything illegal.<p>But - telling your employer in advance that you're working on your own project? Really? What's the advantage in it? What you do in your off time is 100% yours [unless you signed something that says it's not], and letting your employer know about it will not bring you any additional benefits. On the other hand, the disadvantages are huge - everybody will start mistrusting you, knowing that you're looking for a way out, you'll never get promoted, etc.<p>And that's just one point.. Not doing business phone calls in the day hours? C'mon, how realistic is that? How is anybody going to take you seriously if you don't pick up your phone during the day? Instead, you should FIND time during the day for important business-related phone calls. When I was employed, I always ate lunch at my desk in about ten minutes. At lunch hour, I found a nice quiet place in a plaza 2 minutes from the office, brought a notebook to take notes, and made 2-5 business calls.<p>My point is, while you should definitely not do anything illegal, if your #1 goal is to quit your job and make your business your primary source of income, you should find creative ways to reach that goal, and stop at NOTHING before you do that.",1268078632

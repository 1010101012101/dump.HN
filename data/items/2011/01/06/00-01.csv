2073356,comment,2072899,2072899,0,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"Hi, I'm the author. Thanks for all the kind words!<p>I'm very actively developing Hex Fiend, which is nearing a new release.  Some major new features are bookmarks, support for text encodings (including multibyte, though sadly not variable width), support for opening files only readable by root, including device files (after authentication, naturally), and a visual binary diff (a true LCS diff).  There's many other miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes, including the longstanding request of preserving the Undo stack after Save, when doing so would not require too much memory.<p>For those unfamiliar with Hex Fiend, the features that set it apart from other hex editors are:<p>- Very deep support for large files.  Many other hex editors have some support for large files, but it's easy to get into a situation where they consume all your memory, or do some O(n) blocking operation that hangs the UI.  Hex Fiend never does either.<p>- Natural Mac-like editing, including insertion and deletion, smooth scrolling, multiple discontiguous selection, anchored selection, coalesced undo, key bindings, lots more.<p>- It's provided as a framework which is easy to embed in other apps.<p>- It's open source with a  permissive BSD style license.<p>Some have asked how Hex Fiend compares to 0xED.  Not to pick on anyone, but I'll give some examples that illustrate Hex Fiend's strengths relative to 0xED (and most other hex editors):<p>1. Open a large file (say 5 GB), overwrite some bytes in the middle, add some bytes to the end, then hit Save.  Hex Fiend will appear to save instantly because it makes the changes in-place, while 0xED will require time proportional to the file size as it writes the entire file to disk.<p>2. Search for some text.  0xED will block the UI until the text is found or the file is exhausted, while Hex Fiend performs the search in the background, including a progress indicator and cancel button.<p>3. Select everything in the file and choose Edit->Copy.  Hex Fiend will do this instantly, while 0xED will require time and space proportional to the file size, as it attempts to read the entire file into memory.  Now select all and hit the delete key.  Hex Fiend again does this instantly, while 0xED will again try to read the file into memory (to service its Undo stack).<p>Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to answer them in this thread!",1294275459
2073355,comment,2071429,2072759,0,0,sp4rki,,,"I'll go out on a limb and explain what developers 'feel'.<p><i>Say that you're comfortable with remote work</i> - In the case of a local employee, I don't want to have to commute 5 days a week, 2 hours to an fro. Sometimes I just don't feel well enough to go to the office, but I'm not as bad as to not work at all. Sometimes I just need a change of scenery. In the case of a international employee, sometimes the best person for the job will not be a local hire. Sometimes it makes more business sense to hire cheaper for a quality employee that doesn't operate out of your immediate area. You can easily fly a developer over for a few days every month or two if you want to discuss things in person, but most of the time a Skype call is more than enough. Be flexible and you'll keep good developers happy enough to go all out and really want to make YOUR product better.<p><i>Drop the degree requirement</i> - Not sure if you approve or disapprove here, but if you're willing to pay high wages and stake in the company make sure that you're not discriminating on formal education. The moment I find out that I'm being payed less because I don't have a title, instead of it being because of the quality of my work and my experience is the moment I start looking for a new job. In my case, I've never been discriminated based on a diploma, and more often than not I've been payed more than employees with degrees because of proven experience and productivity.<p><i>Guarantee the job only requires 40 hours per week</i> - Hard work does not mean that I should work 12 hours a day, not even because you pay 'high wages'. You want quality projects? Keep your developers happy. Don't push them to put work over families, social life, or hobbies. Be flexible, specially regarding office hours. Do this and the day you tell them that you just got a retarded deadline pushed a month early, you'll find developers working 80 ~ 100 hours a week to get the project done. You reap what you sow so to speak. Of course, you'll have to be a team player and give them a few weeks off the next week though.<p><i>Offer to train people in a new language</i> - Offering benefits to further your employees career makes almost any developer a happy camper. Buy them books and send them to conferences. It's an investment that's well worth it. I'm pretty sure you probably agree with this one, but it's important to point it out nonetheless.<p>My point is that if you want great developers to feel at home in your company and help you build a great product, you need to be as flexible and laid back as possible towards your developers without, of course, giving in to mediocrity. You might like employees that work 12 hours a day every day and are always in the office by nine am, but the people you need are the ones that will move your company forward, and more times than not this are the one's that want their employment conditions to be 'fair' and easygoing.",1294275456

2073305,comment,2071816,2072582,0,0,jlouis,,,"I'll only take some of these:<p>* Error messages: The current format has two distinct advantages to the experienced programmer: They are Erlang terms and can thus be manipulated easily as such. And they are succinct. I definitely give you that they are not easy to read for the beginner, but for the more experienced programmer, they are actually easy to read. Your critique could be countered by writing a ""beginners mode"" which transformed the error into a more readable variant. Which isn't that hard to do but it takes resources which are better used elsewhere.<p>* Strings: Most functional languages, be it Haskell, Erlang, Ocaml, Lisp-variants and so on are usually better off with a representation of string-like objects which are symbolic. The reason is that symbolic manipulation is the strength of these languages - exactly as string-manipulation is the distinct advantage of perl. Furthermore the non-academic world in which Erlang was first used, telephony, has very little need for effective string handling, I might add. Not everything needs a string.<p>* Syntax: The syntax makes it harder to move code around, but not very hard. You will find that swapping the order of the last line with something else is a thing you do rarely. Even in pattern matches. At least I don't think it is much of a problem. Yet, I note that refactoring in other languages is not always exempt from similar problems. Changing type in java names in Java requires you to change the constructor call. Moving blocks of code in Python requires you to change their indentation. Hoisting a function out means you must create it. If it really pisses you off you can just write a style where the delimiter is at the beginning of each line and the . is on a line by itself. Then reordering is easy.",1294274669

More to do with ingenuity, than engineering as a practice.<p>Engineering is an application of scientific - mathematical and physical knowledge to create something. If you don't do the Math, you probably are not an engineer. There is little room for subjectivity.<p>So, I guess most programmers (if not all) are software technicians. They have practical knowledge, but not the proven theory behind it.<p>So you will have ""Fact and folklore in software engineering"", until you can synthesise ""something-driven development"" using knowledge mathematics and science.<p>Currently you have some ideologies and studies on them.<p>In control engineering for contrast to solve a problem, for example a controller regulating the flow of fuel in an engine you have the following procedure:<p>1. You make a model of the open and closed loop system. You know how do the processes look like in derivatives and you can make transfer functions and state-space representations.<p>2. You correct the system according to specification, adding to the models.<p>3. Knowing the physical properties of the different parts of the system you are left with some choices of implementation, but they have different trade-off (physical and economic). You talk with the client and make the appropriate choice. :-)<p>So, you have the heuristics to solve the problems all build on both practice and science and you don't have the engineers split in schools or ideologies :-)<p>I guess it should be the same with programmers.",1294273469

Speaking in very general terms, and especially more about PC software, what I found was that for a say $50 priced unit of software, in a box there at a retail store, about 50% of that went to the retail store, about 25% or so went to the distributor, 20% to the publisher, and then only about $3-5 went to the actual developer. (Approximately, details varied.) Add-in traditional publishing industry shenanigans that try to turn developers effectively into sharecroppers, and almost require huge hype-driven sale numbers, and the situation is even worse.<p>Now with things like Steam and the App Store and with PayPal, etc., developers can publish software directly, much more easily, and the distributor/online-retail middleman takes a smaller cut, so say the retail price can be $5 and the developer takes home 70%-97% of that, depending on if more like App Store or PayPal model, respectively. So the take home income per unit for the developer can be about the same, but at a much much lower retail price point, which is a net win for consumers. And since there are less publishing shenanigans with compensation structure, it's actually possible to sell a small number of units per month and achieve at least Ramen profitability. Which at least buys you runway to develop additional stuff or work on side ventures, so it's a virtuous cycle/snowball effect.",1294272887

Also, the involuntary compensation involves cash, whereas the voluntary (on the US airlines I'm familiar with) is a voucher for future travel.<p>I believe these are the current rules:<p>""If the alternate transportation is scheduled to arrive between one and two hours after the original planned arrival (between one and four hours on international flights), the compensation equals 100% of the passenger’s one way fare to his or her next stopover or final destination, with a $200 maximum additional cash compensation . If the airline cannot get a passenger to the destination airport within two hours (four hours on international flights), the compensation rate doubles to 200% of the passenger’s one-way fare, with a $400 maximum additional cash benefit. This compensation is in addition to the value of the passenger’s ticket, which he or she can use for alternate transportation or have refunded if not used.<p>The last time the rule was substantially changed was in 1982, and the last time the maximum additional cash benefit was raised was in 1978. For 2008, the DOT made several changes, the most important was a doubling of the maximum cash compensation to $400 for domestic flights and $800 for international flights.""<p><a href=""http://www.airsafenews.com/2008/05/revised-bumping-compensation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airsafenews.com/2008/05/revised-bumping-compensat...</a><p>[edited to add the second paragraph, which mentions the 2008 changes, which I somehow failed to get in the first time]",1294272421

2073153,comment,2065151,2065151,0,0,iuguy,,,"Ok, when you say enterprise I specifically think SAP (as I've done way too much to be healthy) and Oracle Apps/Siebel/Peoplesoft etc. Just thought I'd clarify before I start.<p>The singular biggest problem with enterprise software is it's complexity. If your project is so big that you don't have a network diagram because the best you can do is a concept block diagram, your software failed. If it's because it uses dynamic routing and you can forecast information flows, your software failed. If it's because it takes a large amount of data, analyses it to generate more data, which is then fed back for further analysis and so on, then your software failed.<p>Because of the complexity when you start looking under the hood some really bad things start dropping out. I'm talking attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion bad here. Tears in rain and suchlike. In other words, your way of dealing with the app from developing it's own consciousness and trying to take over the world is something stupid like a 4 year lifespan. Classic real world example I see time and time again: Thick client uses a hard coded database login to connect directly to a server, then compares user entered login and password against reference table stored in clear text. I've seen this twice in the past year alone, it's always enterprise (although once I saw it in a security product). Fail, fail, fail.<p>These two add to the third cardinal sin of enterprise software, they're built for particular types of process and never quite fit the business case or structure that acquired these technologies. A large charitable foundation we worked for went to buy SAP after being told they could customise it. In order to cut down costs said charitable foundation bought SAP, the tin and asked the consultancy to minimise customisation. What they got was an FI system for a software firm based in Astoria, Germany (seriously, they shipped with all the defaults and no custom profiles). This meant that they had to enter donations as sales of products.<p>All of this adds up to my final bugbear - price. It costs a fortune to buy the software, usually with horrible terms. It costs a fortune to buy the hardware, let alone maintain it (that is if you're allowed to maintain it), a fortune to tailor (badly) to your environment, usually involving insultants who know nothing about your actual business model/structure/processes/policies/people/etc and don't actually care a great deal about it and costs a fortune to fix when it inevitably goes wrong.",1294272137

Specifically, the nature of terrorism seems to motivate the United States government to go to great lengths in order to cause damage to an enemy that is largely immune to defeat, for cultural and religious reasons. Drones are a great example of how far they will go.<p>The use of nuclear bombs signaled the end of world war two. Maybe the Obama administration is hopeful that surveillance of all communication is the final step towards a resolution of this war. That&#x27;s not legitimate in my eyes, but oh well (i certainly don&#x27;t know the solution). On top of everything else that has happened, zero expectation of privacy seems to be the equivalent of the nuclear option at this point.",1375649988

Its an revolutionary syndicalism union and part of IWA/AIT. Its independent of the industry banch. e.g. if Amazon would have FAU, then the strike would likely effect computing systems bringing the complete delivery to halt. And not just 10% of the workers, who are standing at the door and changing nothing. The FAU is the best union for freelancers and temporary workers, and we are the only one who did win a strike for temp workers.<p>The main difference in German unions to other countries is, that other countries did fight the unions, and the unions did fight back.

6157057,comment,6155530,6155665,2,0,raymondh,,,"In my opinion, the enum module will do very little to improve your life.  It uses a great deal of machinery to solve a somewhat shallow problem.<p>Yes, there will be a few cases when it will improve code and help manage complexity.  But it introduces its own complexities as well (i.e. learning two distinct enumeration types, serialization issues, etc).<p>One example of an unexpected complication is the effect on serialization.  Python is having to change (and slow down) its JSON module just to accommodate integer enums (<a href=""http://bugs.python.org/issue18264"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.python.org/issue18264</a>).  Third-party modules will need to adapt as well.  Another example is the awkward __module__ attribute that you will need to support pickles.<p>That said, the real issue is that for many everyday needs, it is hard to beat the simplicity of what people were already doing.  For example, sometime you only need a couple of constant references into list positions:  PREV=1; NEXT=2; link_next[PREV] = link_prev[NEXT].  Or you need a handful of self-describing constants that can be compared for equality:  ROUND_DOWN = &#x27;ROUND_DOWN&#x27;; ROUND_UP = &#x27;ROUND_UP&#x27;.  Both of these examples were taken from code in the standard library.  Both work just fine and do not need any of the high-powered machinery in the enum module.<p>Once in a while, having an enum will be nice, but you can expect people to go wild with it and use them everywhere.  This will churn your code without producing any visible benefit for end users.  Just as with PEP 8, the enum module will attract fools like moths to a flame.<p>Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t push for enums to be used everywhere.  Show restraint and save them for cases like the socket module where we really did need a way to manage the menagerie of constants.",1375649740

6157052,comment,6155987,6155987,2,0,lusr,,,"1.  This tightly couples the service to the view.  Changes in the view and/or service will potentially result in nasty surprises and spaghetti code.  For instance, what happens if the business processes change one day and &quot;login&quot; needs to return &quot;logged in but email address unconfirmed&quot;?  You want the rules to deal with that scenario confined to a LoginController, not scattered around through each view (consider: an omnipresent login box view vs. a login/signup form view used when a user performs an action that potentially requires login, e.g. &quot;Checkout&quot;)<p>2.  In reality, this simple sample obscures what happens in the real world when you add an input for the user key & password:<p>a.  you will need to pass the parameters to the auth service.  At that point hopefully you will won&#x27;t do anything crazy and will simply e.g. bind the user key & password to $scope properties, and pass the scope properties through to the auth service.<p>b. As stated in (1), your login & logout controller functions need to consider the result of their auth calls and map that result back to a meaningful state for the view -- in the simplest case, it&#x27;ll just be &quot;logged in&quot; or &quot;logged out&quot;, but it can also be e.g. &quot;logged in but email address unconfirmed&quot;, which could require a message to be displayed to the user.  The best place for this state is again a $scope property.<p>So, in practice you would just use a $scope.loggedIn or $scope.user property maintained by the controller login() and logout() functions to resolve this issue.",1375649625

And That disabling Javascript actually makes you more fingerprintable because it&#x27;s rare for browsers to do this.<p>I am guessing that the payload that article mentions s/he does not have included a Windows (or Windows Firefox)-specific exploit which bypassed the tor tunnel so that they could then match the cookie in and out of Tor to identify the traffic origin. Otherwise, just having the cookie through Tor would be pretty worthless.<p>Other people that could be dinged by this would be anybody usuing that specific version of Firefox, without Torbutton. Torbutton wipes cookies when you switch between Tor and not-Tor, but Torbutton as a separate tool has been discontinued and TBB promoted, because to be safe you really need to have a separate browser profile.<p>On Linux (not targeted by this exploit, but maybe someday) you could avoid this using an Apparmor/SeLinux profile that prevented TBB Firefox from even making a network connection that&#x27;s not to the Tor tunnel, or possibly even prevent Firefox from knowing it&#x27;s own IP. Dunno if something like this is even possible on Windows. For traveling, I currently have been experimenting with a VM with TBB and an apparmor profile, and an iptables rule to prevent ANY outside traffic, except Tor. It works but it&#x27;s a pain in the ass and nobody could be expected to install all that shit. That&#x27;s what they made TAILS (A bootable disc image with only Tor, saves nothing to your machine, contains no known exploitable extraneous apps) for, people could check that out. Even running TAILS in a VM would have prevented this, though they recommend for maximum security you burn it and boot it.<p>No sympathy for child pornographers, but obv. this could be used against anybody seeking anonymity.",1375648991

6157012,comment,6156792,6156972,1,0,nostrademons,,,"Also, BTW, I hate the practice of using default arguments to avoid breaking existing code, because it makes the code reflect <i>how it got there</i> and not <i>what it does</i>.  You end up with a bunch of call sites, some that take n arguments and some that take n+1, and you have to look at the function definition to see what the n-arg call sites are doing.  I would much rather use an automated refactoring tool to edit all call sites to take n+1 arguments with the default inline in the call, although this is a bit hard to do in Python.<p>In my experience, the best use for default arguments is when the API contract really does call for &quot;default usage&quot;, but occasionally you need to pass an extra arg for special purposes.  So if 95% of call sites only need n args but 1-2 of them need to vary a parameter or two of the algorithm, then defaults are appropriate.  Passing the extra args by keyword usually ends up being much more readable in this case though.",1375648956

A survey was conducted asking people:<p><pre><code>    A. Which is true:\n           (a) The Sun goes round the Earth.\n       or\n           (b) The Earth goes round the Sun.\n\n       ?\n\n    B. How long does it take?\n</code></pre>\nOf those people who gave the answer to A as (b), over 80% answered B with &quot;a day&quot; or &quot;24 hours&quot; or something equivalent.  In short, they got the &quot;right&quot; answer to A, and then a completely disconnected and obviously &quot;wrong&quot; answer to B.<p>In this case I think people are answering A by reciting a fact they learned when young.  We are told that the Earth goes round the Sun, so that&#x27;s what people recount.  By they don&#x27;t connect that with their personal experience.  Their personal experience is seeing the Sun going overhead.  They &quot;know&quot; that the Sun goes round the Earth, and that it takes a day.  They&#x27;re told the Earth goes round the Sun, and that&#x27;s what they parrot for question A, but when asked B, they answer from their own personal experience of seeing the Sun go overhead.<p>And that takes a day.<p>So I think the student could follow the things they had been told, and they could recite, parrot fashion, all the &quot;right&quot; things that would get them the marks on the test designed specifically to assess their knowledge of decimals places, and then when they had to put it into action, they fell back on what they felt things looked like, and were driven by their intuition and experience.<p>Which was completely wrong.<p>So that&#x27;s my &quot;theory&quot; of where the disconnect lay.

This should be undone ASAP. Some education is required to use Tor properly even without considering things like JavaScript, so teaching someone to enable JS only when prudent should be fine to include as part of that educational package. It seems like there is some nefarious force at work here trying to trick people who really shouldn&#x27;t be using Tor into using Tor. I know, for instance, that I had to stop several of my friends from using Tor after they heard about it from the news or whatever after the PRISM leaks. <i>Do NOT</i> use Tor if you don&#x27;t fully understand the implications, like that all data you send through it is going to be decrypted to plaintext at a random exit node that could be run by literally anyone with a modern computer and internet connection.<p>Fortunately, NoScript continues to warn pretty blatantly with a big red exclamation point that scripts should not be allowed globally, and an educated Tor user will automatically forbid all scripts despite the awful default, so this is probably only a problem for people who are just dinking around anyway.",1375647638

In particular, you are trying to use your experience with finite numbers to decide what &quot;must&quot; or &quot;ought&quot; to be true with infinite sets.  That way lies multiple inconsistencies, and simple proofs that 1=2, for example.<p>You can&#x27;t &quot;cancel out&quot; things when you include infinities.  One thing that we&#x27;ve learned is that &quot;division&quot; has to be an &quot;undoing of multiplication&quot; in order to get consistency.  This is why we can&#x27;t divide by zero, because once we&#x27;ve multiplied the number line by zero we&#x27;ve collapsed it to a single point, and there&#x27;s no way to undo that.<p>If you&#x27;re just dealing with the sizes of sets then the only way to compare sizes in general is to try to pair them up.  This seems reasonable, and then you find that the contents of a bag with two copies of the natural numbers can exactly be paired up with the contents of a bag with 3 copies of the natural numbers.  That seems to suggest that 2 * oo = 3 * oo.  You now have a choice - accept that, and its consequences, or go with your intuition that these things &quot;ought not be equal.&quot;<p>And you really do have a choice here.  The thing is that over 130 years of mathematics has shown that the &quot;equality of size means pairable&quot; approach has no inconsistencies, and leads to useful results.<p>So when you say this:<p><pre><code>    If my definition of infinity is the set of all integers,\n    why isn&#x27;t this true -\n\n        (2 * infinity) / (3 * infinity) = 2/3\n\n    Even if the definition is something else, it&#x27;s the same set,\n    and it should get canceled out.\n</code></pre>\nWell, firstly, we have a fair idea what it means to divide 2 by 3.  We also derive the rules of arithmetic and algebra (things like &quot;cancelling&quot;) from those meanings.  but why should those processes carry over to the infinite case?  You would need first to define what you mean by dividing infinite sets.<p>Now, you have the choice of trying to make that work, but there are problems.  you want to define the LHS to be the RHS, but you&#x27;ll need to tell me why sets that can be paired off exactly, with none left over on either side, should not be thought of as the same size.<p><pre><code>    > For Cantor, it simply must be accepted that the inner\n    > and outer circles have the same number of points  our\n    > intuition that the outer circle has more points, according\n    > to Cantor, is just wrong.\n\n    We know that the outer circle circumference is larger than\n    the inner circle circumference.

I don&#x27;t see the connection from that\n    exercise to the mathematical rules.\n</code></pre>\nI can pair them off, so that every point on the inside circle gets associated with one and only one point on the outside circle.  Why should I not then declare these two collections to be the same size?<p>As I said, there is a choice, and this is the one that has proven to be more fruitful, and lead to no inconsistencies (yet).<p><pre><code>    Normal logic dictates that there should be more real\n    numbers between 1 and 10 than there are between 1 and 2.\n</code></pre>\nWhy?

So was the hit to &quot;human intelligence&quot;, and the threat to those collaborating with the U.S. in Afghanistan, Yemen, and other places.<p>So is the Arab Spring, which continues to kill people every day in Syria (and now Egypt, unless things change soon over there).<p>But either way, though the law is based on the effect of one&#x27;s actions, the law is also often based on the actions themselves.<p>After all if someone were to come at me with a knife, swing and miss, they could still be charged with attempted murder or aggravated battery <i>despite</i> &quot;no harm&quot; befalling me.<p>If I drive around without insurance I can still be cited even though I haven&#x27;t crashed into anyone yet.<p>So likewise, even if our allies in places like Afghanistan and Yemen had managed to be alerted and evade retribution in time that didn&#x27;t change the existential threat they were living under.<p>And that&#x27;s the problem with intelligence and counter-intelligence. Often the enemy won&#x27;t realize that a successful attack against them had intel as a key; the Nazis went through all of WWII with nary a clue that the Allies were amazingly well-informed of their capabilities and intentions.<p>Now we have it on the reverse. The Taliban attack a U.S. base in Afghanistan and destroy 6 Harrier jets [1] in Sept. 2012. Was the day-to-day operational intelligence revealed by Manning <i>completely useless</i> for that? It&#x27;s hard for the U.S. to tell on the other end.<p>How about the people killed, scores injured, and damage done to a Forward Operating Base in Aug. 2012 [2]? Did intel on how the U.S. Army responds to the many previous Taliban and AQ attacks really not help them at all in planning this assault?<p>The problem is that it is hard to conclusively <i>prove</i> that intelligence was useful for a given attack if you&#x27;re only on the receiving end, especially if using the evidence you have would have the effect of divulging your sources. The same reasoning is behind the rumors behind Churchill allowing Coventry to be normally defended (and subsequently severely damaged by German bombing), because he didn&#x27;t want to tip off the German that their Enigma was sometimes readable by the British.<p>But just because you can&#x27;t prove something doesn&#x27;t imply the opposite (that you&#x27;ve proven the intel was <i>not</i> useful). This still helps Manning as far as his trial goes, but history has shown that skilled opponents can utilize far less intel than was provided by Manning to great effect. And common sense would show that there&#x27;s a reason OBL made an effort to get his hands on the leaked intel himself. Presumably the fact he still had it meant at least <i>he</i> found it useful.<p>But even if OBL had found it very useful, he&#x27;d hardly have issued a press release over it, so a lack of crowing about &quot;real life effects&quot; is hardly evidence in support of Manning, it&#x27;s simply a lack of evidence to support either conclusion.<p><i>Edit</i>: I suppose I could at least mention that I agree that using CFAA as a charge <i>in this case</i> is unfair. The best you can say is that downloading data for the purpose of divulging it is &quot;exceeding authorized access&quot; but that has nothing to do with whether you use a web browser or wget, and in any event is already covered by espionage changes and charges of mishandling classified data. Even worse, had Manning somehow managed to use that compilation he downloaded for statistical analyses that aided the Army in their operations it presumably <i>would</i> have been &#x27;authorized access&#x27;, despite being the same actions taken in either case.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/09/6_harrier_jets_destr.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/09/6_harrier_jet...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/08/omani_jihadist_parti.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/08/omani_jihadis...</a>",1375646660

So, taking JIT compilation as a given, he explored the language properties that help or hurt optimization.<p>There are always trade-offs, of course. Sometimes, to gain maximum performance without requiring the overhead of JIT compilation, it makes sense to use C++, so you can be explicit about stack versus heap allocation, boxed versus unboxed values, etc. But I think we can agree that many application developers want to work at a higher level of abstraction while still getting pretty good performance. In that context, one of the languages that he compared is probably a much better fit than C++.",1375646504

It&#x27;s like every idea is interpreted according to some metaphysical schema and judged by whether or not it&#x27;s conceptually harmonious and untainted.<p>In this case, the schema is &quot;equality,&quot; which ironically means that any concrete idea that addresses disparity is prematurely judged as faulty or tainted.<p>It&#x27;s stunningly obvious that the open source community is dominated by males, even if it&#x27;s not more so than the programming community at large.

So why not?<p>There IS a disparity between genders in tech. This is so obvious. Why on earth would you call this an unbased idea?<p>That there is a disparity doesn&#x27;t mean that there is an &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;necessary&quot; disparity. It just means that at this point in human history, women are extremely underrepresented in this particular section.

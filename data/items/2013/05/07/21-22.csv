That just proves he didn't need 70 to ""forever less one day"" in order to write it.<p>But the evidence is <i>strongly</i> on the side that he needed <i>at least</i> 50 years. I mean, did you see him writing Gatsby before the 1909 copyright act? No, you didn't, because before that, he'd have somewhere around 40 piddling years of copyright protection. But the 1909 act passes and sure enough, Gatsby comes out less than 15 years later.",1367963988

If you compared me to my fifth cousin, I probably would look nothing like him, but I might carry similar traits or certainly similar ancestry.<p>Although the article doesn't convey it very well (and I am skeptical of the finding itself anyway), I believe what they are trying to say is that these words all 'have not changed' in that they all have derived from the same eventual ancestor. That is, the word's pronunciation may have morphed, but the words were never abandoned in favor of new ones. \nAn example here would be the English 'four' vs. the Spanish  'cuatro'. If you believe in the reconstruction of the proto-language Proto-Indo-European (and Wiktionary [2]) then these both derive from the word * ketwres[3].<p>The Spanish one is a bit easier to understand.<p><pre><code>   * ketwres (PIE) -> quattuor (Latin) -> cuatro (Spanish)\n</code></pre>\nNothing too shocking there, I hope. Latin dropped the ""es"" off of the end and changed the first vowel a bit, then Spanish simplified the ""uo"" diphthong into ""o"" (perhaps through Vulgar Latin? [4]), and reversed or->ro, and of course changed spelling because it's a different language.<p>English, however, took a little bit odder of a path. Somewhere before Proto-Germanic, * ketwres->* petwr, which was an irregular change  (perhaps to mimic five, which was * pnke->* pmpe [5][6]). Then, a very regular rule, called Grimm's Law [7], kicked in in the first millennium BC, which shifted p sounds toward  sounds (""For English-speakers, it is easiest to think of the sound as an f-sound made only with the lips, instead of the upper teeth and lower lip.""[8]). So * petwr->* fedwr (Note the t got vocalized into a d as well) in Proto-Germanic. West Germanic then lost the hard d in the middle, to make * fewr, which became Old English fower, into Middle English fower, into Modern English four. So:<p><pre><code>    * ketwres->* petwr->* fedwr->* fewr->fower->fower->four\n</code></pre>\nBoth of these are sets of incremental changes from a common ancestor. Individually, the small changes make some sense (I hope), but once you get several thousand years away from the root, words like ""cuatro"" and ""four"" seem like they are completely unrelated by sound, even though they're very related by ancestry.<p>I'm no historical linguist, but hopefully that helps explain why these things sound nothing alike. :)<p>[1]<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/IndoEuropeanTree.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/IndoEurop...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/k%CA%B7etw%C3%B3res"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/k...</a><p>[3] The * indicates that the word is a reconstruction, not actually something attested to in found writings.<p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_Latin#Monophthongization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_Latin#Monophthongization</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Germanic/fedw%C5%8Dr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Germanic/fedw%C...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Germanic/fimf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Germanic/fimf</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law</a> (Yes, one of the Brothers Grimm!)<p>[8] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_bilabial_fricative"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_bilabial_fricative</a>",1367962288

Science and intelligence is about more than blogging whatever comes to the top of your head after 10 minutes of thought. You need to read. You need to think a bit about whether the first reaction that comes to mind is correct: is this <i>really</i> the position you want to write a manifesto about? Do you have data to support your contention that an alleged condition is imagined and actually the people are just lazy losers, and ""suck it up"" is a good prescription? Or are you just expressing a reactionary, right-wing political view borne more out of politics and prejudice than rationality and evidence?",1367962188

I am only a casual gamer, but Kairosoft are one company that offer a very straight-forward proposition with all their games, and I have become a fan of theirs because of it. Their proposition seems to respect all parties; you can download a limited free trial with ads to see if you like the game, and if you do you can go buy a full unlocked version for $5 with no ads. I have bought several of their games now because I really appreciate this simple and honest model. There are no 'gems' or 'coins' to buy, you don't need to 'unlock' items, everything is included in the game it is down to skill to get items and progress. Their games all follow a similar mechanic, but they are all fun and individual enough that I am left happy not feeling like I have been gamed psychologically. I am also not anti in-app purchase, however I will only consider it where it is something significant like unlocking a full version or getting rid of ads, if I am asked to buy a virtual 'chest of gems' or whatever I will uninstall the game in seconds and add that company to the 'never download anything' list. EA, Gameloft, King, Imangi, Zynga and more are all on that list when it comes to games specifically. My advice, which as I repeat is completely anecdotal and subjective, would be to make the best damn game or app you can, release a limited trial so users can see if it works, and then price the full version at something you are happy with and do a full version or an in-app purchase to unlock it. I feel if you are proud of your work, you respect your customers, you will build a fanbase and word of mouth will kick in.",1367961956

Arguably no representative agent is better than a badly specified agent.<p>As an intellectual exercise to show that (for example) menu costs or nominal wage rigidities or technology shocks alone <i>could have</i> the economy's accounted for a shift from a [purely theoretical] equilibrium over a time period they're very interesting. For identifying <i>which</i> aspect contributed most towards economic change they offer little, and as a policymaking tool they're actually worse than useless since the models are generally built on the economists' assumptions about agents' response to policy and fitted to the data to justify those assumptions, rather than using the data to understand how responsive, rational and optimizing agents actually are. As such, their forecasting performance isn't very good either...",1367960502

Considering that this post has garnered a bit of attention, I figured I might as well chime in.<p>First let me say that I found mbellotti's post absolutely wonderful, and find that it serves as an example to the type of team we have become in a very short period of time.<p>We as humans, all have pre-conceived notions of one another whether they be based on appearance, mannerism, figure of speech, etc. For some of us, these first impressions become much more deeply rooted than for others, and I, at least personally, believe them to be a hinderance in getting to understand people.<p>Social relationships aside, this knowledge of, and understanding of one another is an absolutely pivotal part of any team as it leads to better communication, and more importantly builds trust, and friendship.<p>But excellence in teams is also derived from hardship. Mbellotti, in her post mentions that we took the RV to save money, which is true, however, as we started this project on a bus, under somewhat strenuous conditions we noticed that much like a hazing of sorts, the experience brought us, much closer together. Would the discomfort of an RV do the same, I dare say it has.<p>I don't mean to sound trite by saying this, but team really is everything. How often do you see a team fall apart because of squabbles over who's going to be CEO of a 3 person company, or an argument over the hue of blue that's served as a background.<p>To me the post was more about this anything, the trust, and belief in one another, and the internal knowledge that we can and will make it regardless of obstacles, because (excuse the mush) we actually do have one another to rely on.<p>As for the YC interview and later rejection, yes it was disappointing as all rejections are, and as a self confessed PR junkie it would have made that as well as fundraising all the much easier, but it was a great experience nonetheless, as was meeting the brilliant people who interviewed along side us, and whose relationships I would like to continue and nurture, because they really are great people.<p>With that, I highly urge anyone in a startup to get an RV and go a bouts the bay area or NE corridor in it, is a killer experience, leads to some absolutely brilliant stories and elevates the concept of ""The ""Mobile"" Startup"" to whole other level. #hackingWhileMoving.",1367960438

That is pretty much what MS and Yahoo have collectively (IIRC) in the rest of the world, but nobody says they don't factor. Google is very much aware of them, as Baidu is of Google in China.",1269334647
1212513,comment,1211904,1212431,0,0,weego,,,"Absolutely correct. Drilling it down to the logical nth degree you are effectively paying to be part of a defined marketing demographic that can then be sold to advertisers. The reality of course is there is a more symbiotic relationship going on as if people did not percieve value then the circulation would drop off.<p>Glossy magazines like Wallpaper are the most stark example of this where it's often a case of flicking through 4 pages of watches before getting to the next article about italian leather day bags, but news media run on the same model.",1269334643

My product uses >5PB data and we don't bother to do significant deduping. I've only heard of a few products at Google that do, and that's only when you can anticipate that most objects in the system are going to be duplicated many times, which is decidedly not the case in heterogeneous storage like S3's.",1269334237
1212507,comment,1212003,1212410,0,0,jhancock,,,"The CCP _is_ the government.  The distinction is that government is operated with officials that sit on the administration side and others that sit on the ""party"" side.  They all have their functions.<p>Here's an anecdote for you:  a young chinese lady contracted HIV from a hospital blood transfusion.  When it was found out, she was fired from her job and her family threw her out.<p>She sued.  Not just her employer and the government hospital but the government as well for not protecting her.  She won.<p>There are quite a few stories of the little person going up against government and winning.<p>A few months ago, a waitress at a restaurant (hotel) was being accosted by two drunk men..assuming she was about to get raped, she stabbed them.  I think one of them died.  Turns out they were high level local officials.  The girl was given leniency by the court as they understood it was self-defense.",1269334027

That's how democracy works ... you win some, you lose some, but mostly it's a balance (I'm thinking  about the state of affairs in the EU here).<p>What really worries me is the current situations where many people and companies are paying lip service to China's policies, even though it's not in their interest to do so.<p>Sooner or later other governments will adopt similar policies ... hey, if it works so wonderfully in China, why shouldn't it work for the rest of the world?

I remember Kasparov himself commented on this issue recently, saying something like since he doesn't already plays competitive chess, his intuition is not that sharp, while Carlsen is more in shape.<p>Overall, I consider Kasparov to be the best chess player ever, while Carlsen has a potential to be at least as good as Kasparov was in his best years. Overall, I am happy that those two came together.",1269333592
1212499,comment,1211959,1212163,0,0,blasdel,,,"Thanks! Generic Modafinil for $2.20/200mg instead of the usual $6/100mg online for the branded stuff. I'd previously stuck with Adrafinil before, since it's $1/300mg online. The Olmifon packages I've gotten have been labeled at $0.15/pill over the counter in France.<p>But <i>HOLY SHIT</i> that was the sketchiest web checkout process I can possibly imagine that doesn't involve physical handoffs of unmarked bills.<p>So you start off with a normal inventory based shopping cart system, but then none of the 5 sketchy looking payment options is configured â€” instead you go to a separately hosted shopping cart system, and add a stack of gift certificates to that cart in bill denominations. To check out there you have to create an account with a sketchy credit-card-based Paypal competitor called AlertPay, who's signup process has questions about your Citizenship, DOB, and Occupation, ostensibly for some kind of Patriot Act compliance. After doing that you are redirected back to the second shopping cart system, where you have to click through two pages to generate each gift certificate UUID, which it warns you will only be rendered once. Then you add each gift certificate to the first cart until your balance is negative $15 to cover shipping. Now you can proceed to checkout.<p>You'd think it was the least-converting system ever devised, but the extra %600 discount on top of the standard overseas drug discounting is a powerful motivator.",1269333498

I wonder if he can also refute Bentham on day one of a good Ethics class as you can.<p>I would certainly not call Sam Sam Harris an amateur and I would place a large bet on his close familiarity with Aquinas, Kant as well as Bentham or Singer with whom he is in agreement from his degrees in philosophy, his constant debates on the subject and his professional life as a writer and lecturer on the subject.<p>He is a proponent of treating questions of a moral, religious or transcendental nature as scientific questions to be approached via reason.

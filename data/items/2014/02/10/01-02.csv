7208633,comment,7205868,7208562,1,0,e12e,,,"I only challenged the idea that there&#x27;s no (good) feminist research, or that there aren&#x27;t &quot;years of&quot; it. When this stuff started is was much more contriversal than it is today (in most circles anyway). Progress is good :)<p>And in case you misunderstood my point of view: I&#x27;m not advocating reverting to single sex education across the board. I&#x27;m saying that when there is documented bias (on the side of the educators and/or the students) it can be beneficial to run some single sex groups. I know that it can be useful in sexual education to do both separate and common sessions, for example.<p>As for the example in the article, having a class available to a single group of students only; I do agree that it can end up a negative(or strange) inpact on individuals. However the tale of a single privileged male child (obviously has awesome mother!) isn&#x27;t <i>conclusive</i> evidence that it didn&#x27;t do more good than bad overall. It might well have. Or it could have on balance been a good thing if we agree that equal oppurtunity is a worthy goal (yes, negative discrimination <i>might</i> be part of the price we should pay to get there).",1391997590

7208629,comment,7207348,7208422,5,0,einhverfr,,,"> This of course raises the question of what is to be done; the answer is: live within your means, be responsible, know your neighbors, and don&#x27;t be a weird conspiracy theorist.<p>I personally think that collapse is coming.  If I had to guess I would say 20-30 years out but to be honest, that&#x27;s a guess.  It could be ten years and it could be a hundred.  I don&#x27;t think the system can reform itself.  The fundamental question is how we, our children, or our children&#x27;s children can plan to survive when nemesis follows hubris.<p>The things you have mentioned are the beginning but I will give you a few more.<p>1.  Collapse isn&#x27;t the end of the world.  As Joseph Tainter pointed out, nutrition for many Romans improved after the fall of Rome.  I would add that already nutrition among the poor in Indonesia (at least from what I have seen living here) is better than it is among the poor in the US, so we have already crossed the threshold where collapse makes sense to a large part of the population.<p>2.  Trade locally. Build up local economic ties.<p>3.  Plan on retiring with your kids.  Raise them with this in mind.  Part of this is inviting your parents or parents-in-law to retire with you so your kids grow up seeing this as normal.",1391997507

This is the first comment I&#x27;ve read in this thread that&#x27;s dealt with the core issue.<p>We, the world, don&#x27;t need millions of people who can write a good sorting algorithm. A few thousand will do. We need millions of people who can use the sorting algorithm that those thousand people wrote, to build things higher up the stack, and billions of people who can use the things those millions of people wrote to do their work.<p>As you go deeper in the stack, fewer people ever need to understand it, and they will be paid more and more. We don&#x27;t need more computer scientists and sorting algorithms. One good solid sorting algorithm is fine. The whole idea of evolution is we build on the successful developments of previous generations. We don&#x27;t need to know how a lightbulb works, we just use it to illuminate the desk while we write a paper on genetics.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should train kids to be computer scientists — the really talented ones will do it anyway, and the number of people entering this field will continue to grow for the foreseeable future — I think we should train them to be lawyers and doctors who understand code. To a level where can throw together a solid working solution to a problem they have, without having to go to a programmer who may not have the deep subject knowledge that allows a novel solution. If the doctor can code, they can iterate on their idea in a way that just isn&#x27;t possible if someone else is developing it for them.<p>Excel and macros etc are the beginnings of this, but it&#x27;ll go further — at some point JavaScript or Python will hopefully be prevalent.",1391997493

It&#x27;s too bad, though, because Minecraft modding got this kid really excited, and there are many (maybe millions) like him. It seems like it could be a really fruitful area for work.<p>Actually, when I was looking through stuff for him, I found a project that implemented Minecraft bindings for JavaScript with the aim of creating a friendly environment for kids. The author was an HNer and had posted it here a year or two ago. But the project had languished since then, and it struck me (perhaps unfairly) that it probably wouldn&#x27;t work out of the box in all configurations. The last thing one should put in front of a kid is something that immediately frustrates them by failing in strange ways. Tools like that need to be really, really well-hammered.

Encouraging the onward march <i>mindlessly</i> is not helpful.  There has to be some self-reflection and reevaluation of current strategies on how to get to the next technological age, if we are to get there without: nuclear holocaust; human-made plague; trashing our planet so badly we can no longer eat or drink; using up the resources needed for computers and therefore causing computer infrastructure to stagnate and decay just when we need it to run an AI; using up all our hydrocarbon energy reserves and running out of energy that we need to keep up the onward march...<p>There are many pitfalls that might cause this march into the future to end abruptly and miserably, even if the goal of a new technological era is physically and strategically possible given our current resource constraints.

7208610,comment,7205868,7206826,56,0,tomjakubowski,,,"One summer in my childhood, my parents decided to severely restrict my siblings and I&#x27;s access to the internet for unspecified reasons. We were each allowed 30 minutes use of the family computer and its Internet connection, which was &quot;locked down&quot; by passwords on the BIOS and Windows 98 screensaver. The laptop I shared with my brother and sister was still connected to our home LAN (through one of those crazy Intel AnyPoint phoneline network adapters) so we could print out summer schoolwork and such at our leisure, but Internet access was completely firewalled off.<p>The collaboration between my brother and I to get around these restrictions is one of the earliest memories I have of fruitful &quot;hacking.&quot; At the time we both played (and I was obsessed with) a particular MUD, and a half hour per day was not enough playing time, so we wrote a very crude proxy server in VB6 over a week (7 hours between us) that hid in the system tray with a very &quot;system&quot; sounding process name and icon. That way we could connect to the MUD in secret from the laptop, hidden away in our bedroom. I think we later wrote a terrible, barely functional HTTP proxy too. We pulled a few more tricks like reverse engineering the screensaver password (it was stored as a hex string in the registry or something), which turned out to be the same as the BIOS password, before my parents caught onto what we were doing and kind of gave up (maybe they even saw it as a positive learning experience, who knows).<p>That summer introduced me to the idea that a computer is totally malleable in the hands of a determined and motivated person equipped with the right tools. I haven&#x27;t looked back since.",1391997167

In electrical engineering, it&#x27;s any process that arbitrarily limits a signal&#x27;s amplitude. By far the most common meaning is a signal that exceeds the voltage range of an amplifier or signal pathway.<p>> nor any definition that fits the context of this discussion, that allows for a signal&#x27;s peak value not to be reduced.<p>See above.<p>> It&#x27;s called clipping because the extreme values look to have been clipped away, as if by scissors.<p>Yes, but this can result from trying to pass a signal too large for the circuit, or it can mean an intentional scheme in which a fixed signal amplitude is truncated, the meaning you&#x27;re discussing.<p>In the present discussion, in which a volume setting is increased until the speakers are jeopardized, the meaning is clear -- it&#x27;s an increase in signal amplitude that the amplifier cannot support, resulting in the waveform being clipped at the maximum available amplifier voltage.<p>> The parts that have been clipped away contain energy, don&#x27;t they? So won&#x27;t the clipped signal will carry less energy than the original?<p>Not if the signal amplitude is increased. In the present discussion, the problem is being caused by raising the volume level too high, which causes the signal to exceed the available amplifier voltage. My diagram shows this case:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/oE5NFZ9.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/oE5NFZ9.png</a><p>The red trace is the maximum volume setting that the amplifier can support without distorting the signal. The  green trace is a much higher volume setting that essentially reduced the output to a square wave. In both cases, the peak voltage is the same.<p>> When you take a sine wave of peak value 1 and clip it, what you get is not a square wave with a peak value of 1.<p>That depends on how you define &quot;clip&quot;. If you increase the size of the sinewave, clipping takes place at the maximum voltage. If you clip by reducing the possible range of voltages, the sinewave remains the same size but maximum amplitude goes down. The present discussion revolves around the first of these choices.",1391996305

In theory bad things could happen, but it&#x27;s a very controlled environment. Actually teachers will inform parents of conflicts or marking events when it&#x27;s serious enough, and  kids are generally not good at lying or hiding things.<p>To try another analogy, letting a kid access internet without any check is similar to giving 1000$ in cash and just hoping for the best. Wonderful things can come of it, or the kid can go to a drug dealer. Personally I&#x27;d prefer to give him a credit card. If we get a phone call from VISA because of fraudulent transactions, at least we have a chance to do something for the kid.<p>There will be a time when just sitting down and talking to own&#x27;s kid should be enough to avoid most of the very deep trouble. But until he/she matures enough to be able to have such discussions, parents need to compromise, with the two extreme  of restricting the kid&#x27;s freedom to such extent that he can&#x27;t put him/herself in trouble, or let the kid free to do what he/she wants but keep an eye on everything&#x27;s going on. I tend to err on the &#x27;keep an eye&#x27; side until just trusting the kid becomes an option.<p>> </i>Is it healthy to use the tapes to intervene in her conflicts?*<p>No, it&#x27;s not, in any extent. As it&#x27;s not healthy in general to  intervene in a kid&#x27;s conflicts. You&#x27;ll intervene when there is a crisis and your kid will get critically hurt.<p>I think having a log of what a kid does online doesn&#x27;t mean checking it every night word by word. I means having a place to look at when there is something going seriously wrong and you know or need to know if you have to intervene.<p>For everything less than that, it&#x27;s business as usual, talking to your kid, just getting involve enough in his life to have a feel of how it&#x27;s going and give useful advice.",1391996225

People in power love to make excuses when they screw up. Don&#x27;t let them. They also like to say that they didn&#x27;t mean to do anything wrong, but they&#x27;re human so they make mistakes. Don&#x27;t let them get away with that either; if you&#x27;re in a position of power, you should be held to a higher standard than an ordinary person, because your decisions have broader consequences.

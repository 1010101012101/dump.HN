While the N1 often is /good enough/, sometimes it fails badly and recognizes taps miles away from my finger. This is really bad when trying to type.<p>2) this might be an issue of my specific device, but sometimes I have a really bad hissing noise in my headphones. I'm constantly listening to Podcasts and Audiobooks and I can't live with that. HTC has some knowledgebase entry about this one and recommends to periodically shut the device down, remove the battery while holding the power-off button, and then reversing the steps. This, of course, isn't something I'm willing to live with.<p>So in the end it's build-quality that kills an otherwise superior phone for me. Too bad.<p>I hope Google rev's the hardware and we get a N2 that fixes these issues.

Before he became ""The Great,"" Alexander's father Philip arranged for the young man to be tutored by Aristotle, who was already a world-famous academic.  Philip was famous as well, for having his political enemies flayed or boiled alive.  Imagine Aristotle saying to Philip, ""Your son Alexander is a very bright young man.

So they will try to copy successful models/products. The only problem is, if they wait too long, they will lose most of the potential profits.<p>That's called the first mover advantage and I believe it to be sufficient incentives.(Because ya simply got there first, before anybody else, therefore you get looot of money!)<p>Sometime people also just never got around to copying you. This is especially true in my experience. My website once got a huge traffic spike from digg one time. Despite the overwhelming traffic, nobody ever forked my site despite its liberal copyright policies.<p>Heck, the first mover advantages apply to the American publishing industry centuries ago, when there is no recognition of foreign copyright. In some cases, the British authors actually earn more from their sale of manuscript to American publisher(so they can be first), than they do from royalties in their own country.",1275919259

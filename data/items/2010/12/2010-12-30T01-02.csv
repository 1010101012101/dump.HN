2050898,comment,2049105,2050662,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I mentioned the target audience because customers with different needs will have quite different buying patterns. When I want a software product or service, I tend to look at the offerings and make a purchase/signup decision soon after I find what I want unless price is a major factor (ie high). For someone into sailing, one might be interested in consuming content and considering advertisers' offerings year-round, but only make purchases a few times a year, at the beginning of the sailing season or in advance of a trip. Just looking at website analytics without considering market-specific purchase behavior or seasonality can be misleading.<p>You are right that Patrick didn't say anything about him not being hard working, but using the word 'creative' to imply click-farming seemed inappropriate, considering the OP is someone working in the arts. As someone in the same field, I suppose I took it a bit personally - but how would you feel if this story involved a webapp and I said ""here's how I feel about web 'programming' that just moves money from my bank account into someone else's...""? It kind of denigrates the primary skill of the business person.<p>You are right too that new advertising systems like adwords have and deserve their popularity because they provide much better feedback and value than traditional forms of advertising. But I bring up the contrast because those traditional forms remain highly necessary for larger businesses, and part of a business's success rides on being able to accept the changing risk/reward payoff as the business grows. The farther away that a publisher or retailer is from the median, the less reliable the quality of the CTR analytics, and the more hesitant Google ought to be in applying them rigidly. When you get down to a extremely specialist market and where the spikes are measured in a few hundreds, as in this case, statistics can be more misleading than usual.",1293674175

We are reversing payments made to you and confiscating what is in ""your"" account. Thanks.<p>$Client: Whaaa? (Furious form filling).<p>GOOG: Dear $Client: Based on the same information, our automated algorithm $still says you are engaged in click fraud. We are $still reversing payments made to you and confiscating what is in ""your"" account. All your comments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Thanks.<p>I haven't experienced anything with ad sense (never used it), but I have experienced the sorry excuse for customer service their automated systems produce.<p>A few years ago I did the web site for a small retail store, and set up the Google advertising for it. The average bill, per month, was around $500. After about a year, the credit card on the account expired, and a new one was needed. Something went wrong during the update process and the account stayed locked out, even though new credit card information had been entered. This was a situation that needed a human to look at it, for about 60 seconds, to fix the problem. Eventually that happened.<p>It took over six weeks, and dozens of pointless, automated message exchanges. That $500 a month we had been paying to Google wasn't worth even a _minute_ of a human being's time. For a small retail business that absolutely relies on Google advertising to bring in business (it's a highly researched, rare purchase), being cut off Google is a kiss of death. The phone will go from ringing 20 times a day, to ringing once a day.<p>For certain types of businesses, there's simply no alternative to Google. You're either there or you're dead. In terms of revenue/ad$, it was by far the best. The day the ads reactivated, the phones started ringing again. Looking back, I can't believe that I thought that the messages I was receiving from customer service actually meant they were looking at the problem. Knowing what I know now, I'd have a completely separate backup account ready to go at all times, with the same sets of keywords and bids, on the off chance that the main account was deactivated.<p>If this is how they treat people who are trying to _give_ them money, I can't begin to imagine how frustrating it must be to get money _out_ of them!<p>If I were participating in the AdSense program, Google could terminate me for writing this message, according to 5.(xi) of the US terms and conditions, which classifies as prohibited use ""any action or practice that reflects poorly on Google or otherwise disparages or devalues Google’s reputation or goodwill"".",1293673734

When I trained BJJ/MMA a lot we did everything for round time which makes total sense from a sport stand point.<p>The rational with 3 is simple.  Some of the recent writings from people like Alywn Cosgrove and Lou Shuler (2 guys who I think know what they are talking about) have talked about how useless the standard treadmill warmup is for people.  Instead they advocate people focus on dynamic stretching and a focused warmup prior to weight lifting.  So if I'm benching that day my warmup might consist of shoulder mobility stretching/pre-hab and progressively heavier bench weight until I'm ready to do my work sets.  Running on the treadmill would have done nothing to prepare my chest and in particular my shoulders for what was about to happen.<p>If you love running on the treadmill before working out then go for it, but make sure to also warmup whatever you're working on that day from a weight standpoint.  Also, since most people are time constrained that 10 minutes on the treadmill before doing anything else could be better used.<p>When it comes to doing full HIIT, I simply don't have the energy to do it properly and then lift or vice versa.  For example, when I dead lifted this week I did 365x5, 405x5, 455x2, 510x1 after my active warm up.  I followed that with SLDLs, pull throughs and then some plyo work (high jumps, long jumps, etc...).  There is no way I could do any sort of HIIT with the proper intensity after that considering I had a hard time walking :)<p>On days when there is less lower body work I can sometimes squeeze HIIT in at the end of the workout depending on how spent I am.  Generally I'll just mix in 1/6 mile sprints in between various upper body sets.<p>My main cardio comes from doing various other activities like hiking, snowboarding, basketball, etc...",1293672002

2609039,comment,2608496,2608496,1,0,jasonrodriguez,,,"I use my iPad for some illustration and graphics work for 2D games, and for the most part, it is adequate. For illustration, I tend to use Autodesk Sketchbook Pro for illustration, sketching, painting tasks, because it has some great features, is easy to use and works well. If I need something that will let me get ideas down really quickly without getting in the way, Adobe Ideas is the way to go.<p>For animation, you are pretty limited. As far as 2D game animation goes, I have had some success using SpriteSomething for animating sprites and basic animations, and with the most recent update supporting zooming, I want to try it out on a more complex animation than the usual walk/jump/attack/die animations that I have done in the past. The only other animation program I like is Animation Creator HD, which is pretty great. Some of the brushes aren't the best and I have run into some lag when using it (this is on my original iPad), but on the whole it is a fantastic application. That being said, I would never really use it for production work. I would prefer to use Flash or AfterEffects for production so that I have more options, effects, an asset library, etc. But the convenience of being able to animate and test out new ideas and do great pencil tests with full color on the go is absolutely mind-blowing, and for that I thank Red Software for making AC HD.<p>While the iPad is great, the one thing I can't get over is the lack of pressure sensitivity for illustation. I would love to see someone come up with a stylus that senses pressure in the tip and offers and API for developers to take advantage of that data. And, there aren't really any satisfactory vector applications that I have used yet for iPad, so those cute icons and mascot illustrations have to be saved for Illustrator.<p>I haven't tried any android tablets, so I can't attest to that platform's offerings in the art field. One of my buddies does use Photoshop on a tablet laptop with a pressure sensitive screen and has been generally happy with it, but I have yet to play around with it.<p>Hope this helps.",1306958338

If Stalin had done a better job, maybe Russia wouldn't have suffered so many casualties; if Hitler had done a better job, maybe they would have suffered even more.

Reading it was like a train wreck...it's awful but you just can't look away.<p>I don't see how that can be considered in any way a reasonable limitation of the system. I had no idea the ""coins"" were so fragile.<p>Every time I think, ""Hey, maybe it's time to start accepting bitcoin for our software. It can't hurt, and might even help spur adoption of new digital currencies."" Something crazy comes along that makes me think bitcoin isn't so well thought out, after all. I was already a little worried about the ""money"" being stored on our world-facing system. I'd already assumed I would need to transfer to a private account every day or something to insure that a break-in of our web server (which has never happened in our 6 years of running it, but I know enough about system security to know that a determined attacker could eventually find a way in; which is why we don't store credit card data, software signing keys, or anything else particular sensitive on that server). But, this makes me think bitcoin, as implemented, all but guarantees coin loss, given enough time using the system...possibly very large losses, as in this case.<p>Seems that a system crash during a transaction would also lead to the same results. And even one bit of data corruption during saving data would do the same.<p>But, I guess this is the pain one experiences being on the bleeding edge.

It could be 100 deg or 3 ft of snow, it is anyone's guess for most cities capable of hosting a conference in fall. Miami was also chosen because it is not the ""goto"" place for conferences so it will be an experience, which is what we are working at setting up. Also the fact that it is not just a commuter event means that those attending will be there for all of the social events without the strong urge to run home for the evening.<p>As for differentiation, we love what the PSF is doing with PyCon. Our target is a smaller, tighter focused, more intimate experience. From top to bottom the event is focused on showcasing where things are going within Python, so talks will be far more ""risky"" and ""futuristic"" than the average PyCon talk. To clarify, this is not a dig on PyCon, just a differentiation point - both formats are needed. The conference itself will have a more social feel about it than other conferences with fully planned out schedule including evening social events (see CodeConf or JSConf for models). Also with PyCon 2012 moving west, PyCodeConf is a great way to get your Python fix if you are on the East Coast.<p>Hopefully this helps.",1306954908

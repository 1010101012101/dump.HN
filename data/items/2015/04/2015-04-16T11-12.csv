Also being Pharo it is part of the live system and it also push pharo development towards visual coding. As someone else pointed out already Pharo is a virtual OS, so having its own GUI API part of its very powerful live enviroment is very crucial. You can use external GUI APIs but you lose the ability to live code them which is what is the main goal of Pharo anyway.

Taking stimulants will certainly make it possible for you to do mentally more demanding tasks requiring concentration, but so does things like exercise.<p>If you check out the procrastination equation, it describes several factors that we know affect whether if we do work or not. These are: impulsivity (personal character), expectancy x value (how enjoyable the task is) and delay. Basically taking stimulants makes a task more enjoyable (easier) and thus you are more likely to do it.<p>What the popular conception of &quot;willpower&quot; is more like something that acts against impulsivity or reduces it (at least temporarily).

The CGA does generate a signal with a pixel rate of 14.318MHz, so the Nyquist frequency of that is 7.16MHz. But that discreteness it not directly related to the color carrier frequency of 3.58MHz - inside a (sufficiently old) composite monitor, all the processing is analog.<p>As for whether this method of generating colour was supported by IBM - as far as I can tell, it wasn&#x27;t. There is no mention of it in IBM documentation, and the artifact colours in later IBM composite machines (in particular the PCjr) were different. That didn&#x27;t stop games programmers from using it though (at least in the classic and reasonably consistent 16 colour variant).",1429185136

So why not just say that on the main page?<p>I once took a glance at IBM&#x27;s Smalltalk about 20 years ago (in fact, these IDE screenshots remind me of the &quot;VisualAge&quot; IDE that eventually morphed from Smalltalk to Java and was then re-invented as Eclipse).  However, I don&#x27;t know enough about Smalltalk itself for this website to be informative.  Does it compile to executables, or does it require an interpreter or VM at runtime?  Can applications be built from command-line (or a build script on a CI server), or is it tightly coupled with the IDE?  The Wikipedia article mentions some web frameworks, but the Pharo website shows screenshots of what appear to be desktop GUI applications (or maybe data visualizations running inside the IDE, a la R with RStudio?).<p>Maybe someone with some hands-on experience could provide a TL;DR, for those who aren&#x27;t willing to read the full book just to get a high-level sense of this?",1429184951

If this value is XORed with the high bits of a local pointer it turns it into a global pointer, and vice-versa.<p>Example: turf A has a local space register of 1010100000 (binary; lets keep the numbers small, but Mill addresses are really 60-bit). Note that the low five bits are 0. All local space masks will have some number of low bits 0.<p>A local address is 0000011000. Note that the high five bits happen to be zero. XORing in the local-space base would give the global address 1010111000.<p>Another local pointer might have the bit-pattern 0000100111. Note now that there is a bit set beyond the low zero bits in the mask; this time, the XOR will convert it into the global address 1010000111.<p>So as the local base mask has low bits all zero, all addresses within that span will be sequential in memory. But local space is disjoint in global space. This affects only the maximum continuous allocation size and not the total number of allocations.<p>When turf A forks, the child has to have local base mask that preserves the relative position of all allocations. But as the XOR mask will be different, the global addresses will not overlap for these &#x27;local&#x27; allocations.<p>The vast majority of mmaps are actually shared (file buffers etc) and don&#x27;t need this XORing. The CPU is transparently doing the XOR when needed and its nothing normal programs need to know about; only the kernel, when giving out new mmap regions, needs to know if it should hand out a global or local address.",1429184678

9387195,comment,9385807,9385807,0,0,yaantc,,,"In a sense Moore&#x27;s law is already over. It&#x27;s not only about transistor density, there&#x27;s an economic side too: the original paper talk about the density of the <i>least cost</i> process. So the law ends either when we can&#x27;t increase the density, or when we can&#x27;t do it without raising the cost.<p>Now look what Samsung says (from <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1326369"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1326369</a>): &quot;The cost per transistor has increased in 14nm FinFETs and will continue to do so, Low said&quot;.
Now I know Intel has a different take on this, but a few months ago a JP Morgan report said that Intel cast wast TSMC selling price... They have more margin to reduce costs.<p>And that&#x27;s only the marginal cost of transistors. The NRE costs to design a new chip (design & tests, masks) are increasing with each new process nodes. For massive volume players (Intel, Apple, Qualcomm...) that&#x27;s acceptable. For low to mid volume players these NRE costs must be factored in, and they penalize new nodes. A lot of smaller players stop way before the latest 14/16FF. 40nm is common, and 28 will see a lot of people stop there (the last node with no double patterning).<p>For an interesting analysis of the cost factors in semiconductors, here&#x27;s a nice blog:
<a href=""https://www.semiwiki.com/forum/content/4522-moore%92s-law-dead-long-live-moore%92s-law-%96-part-1-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.semiwiki.com/forum/content/4522-moore%92s-law-de...</a><p>BTW, the &quot;least cost&quot; part is very important. The cost of developing and putting in production each new process node is increasing. But as long as the cost per transistor (with NRE amortized ;) goes down, the accessible market is increasing and can bear the increasing cost.
When costs start to increase, you need a reason to pay more for the newer node. That&#x27;s performance (whether speed, power efficiency or a mix). And not everybody will accept to pay for better, some are ok with the &quot;old&quot; nodes. So the market base is not increasing, it&#x27;s reducing. At some point it won&#x27;t bear the massive R&D needed.
This is not a nice though for all the experts involved in this expensive game.",1429184107

Since mixed-content XHR is blocked, if the app is on an https origin, the media data has to come from https origins, because cross-scheme CORS is blocked for security reasons.<p>You want to have the app on https for several reason, starting with the security of session cookies, but in the case of DRM, there&#x27;s a reason for browsers to seek to limit the EME API (the JS API for communicating with the DRM component) to https (though AFAIK no browser does so at the moment):<p>DRM schemes usually implement node locking, i.e. anti-cloneability of the DRM state from one device to another. The obvious way to do this involves keys that no other device has. If information about the possession of a persistent key that no other device has is exposed to a network eavesdropper (e.g. by presenting, in the clear, a certificate for a unique key), the eavesdropper can use that piece of information to track devices and, therefore, users.<p>While this problem could be mitigated in the design of the DRM protocol, to move addressing the problem out of what the DRM component controls to what the browser controls, limiting EME to https is the most straight-forward solution that can be implemented on the browser level. And as noted above, this has the side effect of limiting the MSE-feeding XHR to https, which means the media data needs to be served over https.",1429183362

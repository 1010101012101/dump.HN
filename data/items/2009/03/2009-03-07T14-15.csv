The proggit discussion has many insights.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/82s16/has_joel_spolsky_been_honest_about_his_time_at/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/82s16/has_joel_...</a><p><pre><code>  The context is important. First, it is in reply to this, which quotes Spolsky as:
    ""This seemed to piss off a guy named Greg Whitten who headed up the App Architecture
    group. Now, Greg was something like Microsoft employee number 6. He had been around
    forever; nobody could quite point to anything he had done but apparently he had
    lunch with Bill Gates a lot and GW-BASIC was named after him.""
  Second, the post to the mailing list itself is a forward of a private e-mail
  from Greg Whitten. I can't see if he said anywhere he was okay with making
  it public.

Based on the ratio of projects they buy that die, I think they're going to begin pushing for more internal development and less acquiring outside technologies.<p>Of course if a site is a sensation and has an established community in a short time that may be worth purchasing but overall I don't think we'll see Google going after any of these.",1236437653

He writes like somebody who knows how to write.<p>It surprised me then and surprises me now, because there's some reputation of Zuckerberg as a sort of clueless cro-magnon whose web site is an ugly, lame waste of time, and while I disagree with the latter very strongly, I still like reading the posts he makes and getting the feeling that he is, in fact, a very smart person.<p>(I also love the fact that he's the man whose at the age and fame level to really be able to use Facebook and become a celebrity-hounding fameballer, but hasn't taken advantage of  his success whatsoever. The guy just has a very honest feeling to him, and that reflects in his site. I like that.)",1236435640

That hardly seems like a reasonable definition.<p>I would bet that you say things all the time that you do not know with 100% certainty but which seem likely enough than you assume them to be true. I have never met someone who does not.<p>For example, have you ever told somebody that you were meeting somebody else when you were not looking right at them as you prepared to sit down for the meeting? What you actually mean is that you <i>believe</i> you will meet them based on your understanding of a conversation you had. You could have heard the wrong day, they could be right about to cancel, your car could break down  you get the idea.",1361473168

Yet the vast majority of objects in the asteroid belt are under half a km in radius.  Prospectors don't get to pick where the metals are. And by mass, or count, or chance, its overwhelmingly likely to find it in one of the small asteroids.<p>If you assume towing an asteroid into orbit and then mining, now we know its a tiny asteroid and the dust is still a problem.  However it seems foolish in the extreme to haul gigatons of slag to orbit and then mine it, instead of just hauling back the valuable stuff. The energy costs are going to make or break the feasibility of any space mining project.",1361473143

The difference I see is that lots of Lisp authors praise ""no syntax"" and code-as-data, so it seems to be encouraged, whereas I don't see Python programmers encouraging use of eval. Lisp seems <i>designed</i> for this kind of meta-programming. And it's really cool! It just makes me nervous.<p>As an outsider, I really appreciate the responses from you all. Basically you seem to be saying, ""It's not an issue. We use it for macros, not for untrusted inputs. Don't call eval and you're fine."" Obviously I wouldn't want you to do anything else. :-)<p>Anyway, thanks for the replies. It's great to have a community where I can ask Lisp users about something like this and learn what they think!

Sony has long been prolific in their specifications, which as a then-fanboy I learned were hard limits more fulfilling of marketing checkboxes than usable performance (ex.: yes, it's a 50GB drive; no, you can't use 10GB of it because we're obligated to store ""installation copies"" of software which you can't get to).

If you look at the pre-iPhone world the dominant way to access web content was WAP - a closed protocol for accessing strictly controlled services managed by the carriers. Blackberry was working closely with carriers to develop closed, branded services with them and Windows Mobile couldn't run a proper browser and had low market share.<p>I think Google's strategy was to provide no-name handset manufacturers, without the clout to develop these proprietary services or make such deals, with a cheap platform that could browse the web and access Google services. It was a desperate attempt to avoid a world where all mobile services were carrier controlled.<p>In hindsight they actually needn't have bothered. Apple had sufficient leverage with the iPhone to avoid having to make carrier on-line service lock-in deals. Still, Google couldn't afford to risk that changing, or Apple locking in users to services of it's own.",1361470543

5258896,comment,5256771,5256771,43,0,nakedrobot2,,,"Hi,<p>Creator of the image here. First of all, thank you for all the attention, it's a real honor to be on the front page oF HN for almost a whole day now.<p>I am the founder of 360cities.net and creator of previous world record  images such as ""Prague 18 gigapixels"", ""Strahov Library 40 gigapixels"" and ""London 80 Gigapixels"". This newest image was commissioned by BT as a kind of closing ""Thank you London"" gesture of the Olympic year. Of course, they didn't want ""just"" a jaw-droppingly enormous image, they wanted a <i>world record</i> image! Unfortunately, these things are getting a lot harder to accomplish, and we're starting to go up against some constrainsts of optics, air density, and so on.<p>So, to create this image, we needed 4 cameras shooting simultaneously in order to get all the images in a reasonable length of time. We needed the very best optics out there, and CMOS sensors with the smallest pixels (somewhat unfortunately this meant the 3 year old Canon 7D). We needed the fasted and most precise panoramic robots to mount the cameras on. We needed gigantic memory cards, 128GB, to store a full run of images on one card. We needed 4 laptops to copy the cards quick enough to shoot again (buying more cards wasn't in the budget). In short, we needed a ridiculous amount of gear - this took 2 days to set up.<p>We spent 3 days shooting. The first day it was raining, but we shot anyway to learn the gear and see what mistakes we might make. The second day there were 50km/h winds which, 150 meters up, is very cold and a little bit dangerous. We made sure the gear was triple secured, and we shot anyway. One of the three photographers threatened to leave the project. It was unpleasant. But we uncovered more issues which we were able to solve. Keep in mind the cameras were moving continuously, and focusing, and shooting - they never stopped to take a shot.  12600 shots while moving and focusing each time? This required some very exacting work, knowing the gear, and maybe even a bit of luck.<p>Day 3 was clear, and not windy. We got 2 sets of images shot. All cameras got the shots they needed in 2 sets. That is 96000 images with not a shot missed. This to me is a huge technological achievement that i'm proud of, and I will sing the praises of Canon anytime someone asks me to :-)<p>Now, on to stitching. Normally I have no problem stitching 2 or 4 thousand images. But this is an order of magnitude more. As gabriel weinberg noted recently, you find out what breaks when you increase things by an order of magnitude.<p>Basically, the stitching software, Kolor Autopano Giga, was basically inoperable with this size data set. They scolded me for not having told them about this shoot beforehand. They told me that they know about the issues but other things are taking precedence in the development of the software. Stitching a world record amount of images is, by definition, an edge case. So they weren't really able to help me.<p>Stitching ended up taking nearly 4 months when we thought it would take about 4 weeks. These 4 months were spent working until 3 or 4am many nights of the week. Deadlines slipped. I suffered. My family suffered. After 6 weeks of work I had accomplished nearly nothing and started to panic. I just had to keep on pushing....<p>In the end, we had to set a delivery date for the client. This required me to leave a few mistakes in the image that I would have liked to fix. However keep in mind that some areas of bad alignment on a normal image might take 30 minutes to fix, but with this size project in the software, it took A WEEK to fix. This kind of work is extremely demoralizing and there isn't much to be learned from it either.<p>In the end, the image is finished. As they say ""you never finish, you only stop!"". I'll probably make a few more fixes, later. For right now I need to decompress for a while.<p>So that is some background on how the image was created. It's not perfect, but overall it is much better than I expected. Shipping it was a terrible, brutal grind that I hope to never experience again. But it's done now and that feels pretty sweet.<p>I'm typing this on the bus home from the airport after being in London for a tv show where they announced the image. That was fun. But the best feeling is knowing that the thing is finished and shipped, and if I ever have to do a similar job again I will hopefully learn from the mistakes made on this one and not have such a terrible grind again.<p>I'm happy to answer any questions about the image that I didn't answer here. thank you!",1361469749

That was the only way I could make sense of this: ""The only downside is that it only works if you're using the default Samsung Keyboard... If you don't use the Samsung Keyboard, items are still copied onto their clipboard - but you're unable to access them. Once you have copied around 20 items, the phone throws this error:""<p>I still may have missed something, of course, but it's pretty unclear what the author means. Does the problem happen only with the Samsung keyboard? Only with other keyboards? Or what?<p>And now that I think about it, how would the input method selection affect the operation of the Copy action? Does Copy go through the input method at all? I get exactly the same select-text-and-Copy interaction regardless of what input method I've selected. Even if I select the Null Keyboard or Null Input Method, I still get exactly the same interaction for select and copy. This makes me suspect that the input method isn't involved in this interaction, although I don't know the Android architecture well enough to be sure.",1361469737

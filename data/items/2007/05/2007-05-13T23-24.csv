Tossing out the hard sell of all of your ""solutions"", when a customer came looking for something specific?  I'm pretty sure I'd hang up and call the next vendor on my list.  I want expertise and personalized service, not some greedy doofus doing a half-assed job at a dozen different things and expecting me to consider that a positive thing.<p>As a small company, you must focus.  Be the best at one thing, before even thinking about being a dozen things.  When you're bigger (and have established yourself as the best whatever in the world) you can expand.  Be strong in one area, and leave everything else to others.  Maybe later, you'll have to resources to tackle multiple areas...but even then, the moment you take your eye off of your core business, there will be a half-dozen competitors who are more focused who eat your lunch.",1179098005

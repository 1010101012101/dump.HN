1813029,comment,1810704,1811663,0,0,gxti,,,"No, the core of a stock exchange resides entirely in RAM. Everything is reset once a day (overnight for stocks, immediately after regular hours for futures), and brokerages are responsible for resubmitting long-lived ""good 'til cancelled"" orders each day before the session begins.<p>Despite being RAM bound it's easy to parallelize because each stock is its own isolated exchange, so they can be distributed across hardware in proportion to the average volume in each stock. In other words, it's localized but embarrassingly parallel.<p>The only traditional databases are for reporting purposes e.g. who traded with whom and are append-only as far as the core exchange code is concerned. The reporting database is coupled through the same firehose feed that you can get as an exchange member, albeit with more redundancy. There are also access control systems that only come into play when you first open a session, and lots of other moving parts each with their own task. For example, if you lose your connection to the exchange you can ask a certain (non-core) server to replay all the events that happened from a given point in time in order to catch up. These, too, would be listening to the main event stream and spooling to disk, but the central exchange processes are RAM-only.<p>How do they handle machine failures? That's harder to speculate on from the outside, but if I were them I'd be running the same exchange in parallel on 2-3 machines. I don't know how it could be done without serializing the incoming order flow to make sure that each machine sees the same order of events, but it's not impossible.",1287607880

Unfortunatelly this can hurt if you have only have some mundane programming job. I certainly cannot use my theoretical knowledge at my job, I can only use it in side projects. I know a mathematician with orders of magnitudes bigger math knowledge than me: his taste is so abstract that even tasks which I find exciting are boring to him.

You're a brilliant nerd who founded a startup that <i>invented a new programming language</i>. This isn't for you. Or for me.<p>Getting to be Nerd Jesus every time a computer runs into trouble is gratifying. We get to be important. We get to trick out our gear to do all kinds of goofy, custom stuff. We get to build things that are neat.<p>Serving our needs is certainly important. It's important, also, to understand that <i>we are the minority</i>. Everyone else just wants a tool that works. The majority of human beings on earth find computers to be mystifying, frustrating, even scary things. Absent Nerd Jesus, the computer just seems to have a mind of its own. It has its own agenda and interacting with it is an exercise in guesswork and black magic.<p>What the iPad, and the iPhone before it, has taught us is simple: people want a computer they understand. They want technology, but optimizing for Nerd Jesus has given them <i>shit</i> technology that doesn't respect them, so they're used to being defensive around it.<p>This is all a long way of saying that I agree with you – this could be a first step in ""locking down the platform"" for you and me. And streamlining it so it's actually useful for everyone else who doesn't fetishize the Terminal, kernel extensions or compilers.<p>I think there will always be a place for Nerd Jesus to do his thing. But instead of being the focus of the market, we're finally going to focus on the vast majority of what <i>most people actually care about doing</i>.<p>We'll see what it costs us from a nerd perspective. I suspect it's less than we think – aside from the high of our indispensability as troubleshooters, of course.",1287605474

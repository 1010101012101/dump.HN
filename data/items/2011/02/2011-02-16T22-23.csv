2228737,comment,2228056,2228056,0,0,chipsy,,,"I think the ""root of all evil"" comes from _discussions_ of premature optimization in public forums, not the act itself. Optimization discussions tend to take these archetypes:<p>* Existing performance problem<p>* Concerns about planning architecture/approaches<p>* I want to make it fast, is this plan a good one?<p>The first two can be OK, although in most cases the second goes nowhere because nobody has the deep and highly specific domain knowledge needed to help with estimating performance in the large.<p>The last kind is the worst - the person who initiates the discussion has already decided that there is a problem and tried to act on it, and oftentimes wants to brag a bit, and now people can either tell him he's right(boring) or he's wrong/premature(causing conflict). Since these days, most of the time it's premature, there's a huge cargo cult of programmers who essentially say ""never optimize."" This cult battles against both the performance freaks, and the people who are simply curious about learning and applying more optimization techniques.<p>Internally to a team, the discussion is fundamentally different as it's made within the context of ship date, spec, etc. Any debate is ultimately settled by the leadership, right or wrong. It only becomes a problem when people can hold the debate in a realm of unbounded perfectionism.<p>Besides, if you keep your mouth shut, you usually discover for yourself if it was a good idea to bother optimizing.",1297897122

The site demonstrates a lot of your characters and it's all looking good :)<p>My (sincere) question is regarding the help you had.  I noticed you credited extensively to a few folks and your boyfriend.  Other than Django/Python, there's also server setup (BitCould?)--did you do that yourself as well?  Did you work on this full time for 6 weeks or was this an after 9-5 hours project?<p>I don't mean to pry; just simply want other folks out there who are also self-taught and are working on their own projects to understand the extend of your hard work with great assistance from experts in achieving this great result.  In other words, could you explain the ""magic"" a bit so we can have a deeper understanding of your process?<p>A lot of time, people gloss over the hard work parts and in some way that perpetuates a misunderstanding which says: ""it's easy to create something good.""  I don't that is the case.  Even in The Social Network, Zuck seems to somehow create Facemash or even Facebook in matters of hours while drinking beer.

2228730,comment,2226375,2228520,0,0,raganwald,,,"OK, pretzels. Your analogy looks like this to me: Pretzel guy has a stand inside the park, where he gives away pretzel tongs for eating hot pretzels. You want pretzels, he used to give you his mobile phone, you'd make a call, give somebody else your credit card, and the pretzels would be delivered to the park.<p>Now Apple says that (1) he has to sell the pretzels inside the park if he also sells them outside the park, (2) he has to charge the same price, (3) Apple muscles him for 30% of his action on sales inside the park, and (4) he can't have pretzels from outside the park delivered to you in the park. You actually can buy pretzels by phone from his store in the park, or with your web browser, but he can't put the link to his pretzel store or the phone number of his pretzel store on the pretzel tongs he gives away.<p>If pretzel guy can't make a profit, he leaves. If enough vendors leave, the park is less attractive and fewer people buy tickets.<p>So yeah, maybe as a customer you won't be happy if pretzel guy can't figure out how to make money at Apple's expense. And yeah, maybe as a developer you aren't happy if you can't figure out how to exploit Apple's customers without Apple exploiting you. And maybe everybody goes somewhere else.<p>Seems like the free market at work. So what's the problem here? You have choices, exercise your right to choose.",1297897031

2228610,comment,2210469,2210924,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I'm saying that tech got ahead of the patent office in the 90's, and that combined with a zeal to 'own the road' as a business model had companies patenting anything and everything. That of course then spawned a huge patent trolling industry which has had a significant chilling effect on companies.<p>A very real consequence of this was ""datasheets."" Prior to the great patent rush semiconductor companies published datasheets which described their chips in great detail. This allowed engineers to write software to use the chip and build systems with them. By the late 90's the ""datasheet"" for the interesting chips in a system (sound chips, video processor, GPU, etc) had devolved into a description of electrical signals, pinouts, thermal data, and just enough information to verify the chip was functioning. Detailed information about programming was only available under NDA and sometimes only with a binding purchase agreement in place.<p>Being particularly frustrated by this when writing a driver for a video chip, I used every ounce of influence I had to talk to the guy at the company where the chip was made who ""owned"" that decision (which is to say he could have said, 'let anyone have the data sheet' and it would have happened). His response was that they didn't release the data sheet because while they didn't believe they violated anyone's patent in their designs, it was impossible to prove that they didn't (you can't prove a negative and all that) and so they took the expedient route of restricting the number of people who ""knew"" how their chip did what it did to reduce the attack surface for patent trolls. This has been, apparently, the standard operating procedure for over a decade now.<p>The combination of the 20 year window (which means even if someone patented something its expired by now) and an improvement in the ability of patent examiners to deal with ""tech"" (we've now got examiners who were in high school in 1995 so they understand at a much better level novelty when it comes to tech). Means tech companies can engage with individuals with less risk, and that using techniques ""everyone knows"" or uses is much less likely to come bite you back.<p>No idea how big a damper it will turn out to have been, but I'm watching for the signs ...",1297895122

My experience is the opposite, work with Facebook as much as you can, even if most of the ""Likes"" comes from friends.<p>There's two (combined) reasons for that:<p>1. It's really hard to acquire users. With or without budget, the most important part of a startups success is the ability to find and get onboard new users/customers. Facebook might only be one method of getting people sign up for your service but hey, it's one of the most effective ones. If 200 people click ""Like"" on the same day, of course it will go viral if it's a cool startup. Friends or not, it 's people and most of them have great networks of other people around them. People with many friends are more likely to succeed not only with your Facebook Page but with the business itself. Guess why? People know people, even if they're not themselves in the right target group. Get many people like you, and they'll like what you're doing (and their friends to, <i>hint</i>).<p>It's no rocket science, really. Facebook is very effective for marketing. Use it. Tips: start the page as fast as you can. Growing the amount of fans takes time, with many invited friends or not. If you get pre-launch press, use it for something. To have 200 FB fans when you launch for real are very valuable.<p>2. Retention. Facebook is great as a reminder to people. If you have many FB fans, you have many people to remind about your startups existence. Facebook is useful for getting long-time value of a initial interest/hype/launch.

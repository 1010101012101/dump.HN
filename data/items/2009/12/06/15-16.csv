979681,comment,979481,979481,0,0,giardini,,,"How are you away from work? If you're rarely angry there, then it's job-related. Anger is a symptom: the cause can be genetic or environmental.<p>One excellent programmer friend is ""naturally angry"". He takes medication to control it. When his pills run short, his voice level and agitation increases noticeably. He has shared his difficulties, which makes it easier for everyone else to work with him. Angry or not, his judgement is always sound and exacting and you'd best listen to him, whether he is raising his voice or whispering.<p>So if you're like my friend, see a psychiatrist. They understand the organic causes of emotions better and can prescribe appropriate drugs. Otherwise try a kickboxing class or a good run or ask a girlfriend for a little sustenance.",1260115152

But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as they were.<p>So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture.""<p>Full conversation: <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523"" rel=""nofollow"">http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523</a>",1260112303

If so switch jobs.<p>However, if you've been switching jobs for a while now and still feel the same way at every job, then either you've got bad luck with picking your jobs, or you're just a bit too sensitive.<p>At the end of the day though, no job is going to be perfect, and you're not going to be at any job forever anyhow -- so my advice is to just let things slide, brush your shoulders off (channeling Jay-Z), and say to yourself this crap isn't going to matter in a year or two anyhow so why am I getting worked up about this.

If you're persistently unhappy at work, this is probably a sign that you should be trying to move to some other kind of job, although I realize that will be difficult in the current economic situation.  Being persistently angry will eventually take its toll on your health, or could result in incidents which will damage your career, so this is really just a question of self preservation.",1260111840

5435715,comment,5435564,5435654,5,0,jmillikin,,,"I'm a user. I hate file hierarchies. IMO, the ideal interface to a computer's data storage system would have two ways to find a document:<p>1) A list of most-recently-seen documents. Each application would have its own list of documents it had seen, and there would be a per-user list for documents from all apps. Documents are added to the lists when they're created, opened, downloaded, etc. There is no limit on number of documents in the list, and the list is searchable. Some modern applications have primitive equivalents, but not as the primary document-opening interface.<p>2) Give each list a search box, with results as a flat list of extracted metadata. Honestly, just clone the current standard web search engine UI and use that. A search box is the closest computers have come to being user-friendly, and is certainly nicer than dropping the user into a file manager.<p>---<p>Example: Firefox's ""recent documents"" list would be a combination of browser history and downloads panel. To open a file you just downloaded, find it in either Firefox's list, or the global list, and click/tap it. To open a web page you just created in a text editor, you would click/tap it in the global documents list and indicate that Firefox should handle it (e.g. with an Android-style app selector).<p>Keep existing file-management API calls as they are, and don't tie them into the document system. I don't want a game to add a new document entry for every .so or .png it loads. Application developers can decide how best to represent their document in terms of low-level filesystem objects (a directory, a flat text file, a binary blob, whatever fits the document best).",1364191020

A supermarket is closer to an art statement about inherent chaos of modern lives than to anything hierarchical.<p>Yes, there are hierarchical systems, the big one being a common management structure (which works eh), and administrative subdivision of countries (hint: people almost never actually traverse that tree, they always go directly for a specific entity in it. Also, they routinely get lost in it). They're a bother and used when they can't be avoided, or when nobody bothered to work on something better.

5435707,comment,5434874,5435573,3,0,dsfasfasf,,,"And a good reason of why chess does not translate to other activities is that probably most of the patterns that you learn in chess do not show up in other domains so you cannot really use those learned patterns in other situations.<p>For example, learning a new language means learning lots of new patterns. A lot of those patterns are new grammatical rules. If you were to learn a Latin derived language like Spanish then a lot of those same patterns can be re-used to learn another Latin derived language like French. With chess, unless those patterns you've learned exist in other domains then they are useless and can only be used to play chess.<p>One of the thing chess can do you for you is increase your memory, maybe, since as you said you need to become a chess database.

That's a great start.""<p>Then I got to your second paragraph. Yes. You're on the right track. Buddhism and Hinduism are ""designed"" not only to demonstrate the ""true reality"" beyond appearances, but to show that the end of suffering lies in that direction.<p>It is true that mindfulness <i>as it is commonly understood</i> may not lead to what you seek. The primary obstacle you'll face is that mindfulness is typically dualistic -- there's a _you_ observing a _that_. If the true nature of existence does not distinguish subject and object -- that is, if it is nondual -- then this will always be a stumbling block.<p>I eagerly recommend to you two similar paths. One is Advaita Vedanta. Examples of sages and teachers would be Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, and more recently, Greg Goode and Rupert Spira. Check out Goode's ""Standing as Awareness"" for the most clearheaded investigation I've found.<p>The other path is the pinnacle of Tibetan Buddhism: Mahamudra or Dzogchen. You can find a Mahamudra manual online at chagchen.com. It was authorized by one of the great living masters of the tradition, so it's legit.<p>In both cases, having a teacher to keep you from wandering off into nonsense may be critical. Check out ""the Advaita trap"" on YouTube for a somewhat humorous example of that.<p>As you investigate Buddhism more deeply, never forget that the different schools have more philosophical differences than commonalities, despite the kumbaya face they present. The mystical traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism are far more similar to each other than to their parent traditions, and folks from neither school will openly admit this. And if you continue to follow the Theravada tradition, make sure you understand the difference between being an arhat, bodhisattva, or Buddha. If you're into ""seeing through the illusion,"" this will be important.",1364190368

We HATE it!<p>Do you remember that Leave Britney Alone kid?<p>Speaking as a developer, the ability to do interesting things with files has improved dramatically over the years. You can do the email attachment thing, iTunes sync, clipboard, Dropbox... In my day, we put things on S3 and passed custom links around. And we liked it! (Not really; it was terrible.)<p>As a user, now, I call bullshit. It's occasionally weird but it's definitely not a rage-inducing condition.

Dump an app. Don't worry  nothing you do in any other app will be affected.<p>Does it make for some duped data? Probably. Maybe tons for certain workflows. Doesn't matter.<p>The hermitcally sealed environments of each app let a larger swath of their userbase manage things without outside help.

As an organizer of the Pittsburgh Python group I feel a sort of camaraderie with her and the other members of our little community. I can't truly understand her experiences as a woman in this industry, but I know she is hurting now, and I won't ever forget that.<p>These women are our people. They are tinkerers and geeks and perfectionists and builders and creators and geniuses and artists. They are who we are and who we aspire to be. There is plenty of imperfection to go around on both sides of the gender divide, but what we all have in common is a desire to be better... Better at our work or our craft, better at our fun. I think if we took just a little bit of that energy and aimed it at being better at relating to and respecting one another, we would all be better off.<p>We can make progress on this issue of sexism. We can start by practicing a bit more professionalism, even when we think no one is watching. We can make progress by thinking about others first when we think or act. We can make comments with real value, rather than shock value. We can acknowledge that there is no inherent connection between boldness and rightness. We don't need to start treating women differently... We are already doing that and it is only making things worse. We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard when dealing with everyone.<p>What if we all went to work today and encouraged every good idea, and were constructive toward every bad idea? What if we talked about software like it was software, not a swimsuit model? What if we stopped being so impressed with ourselves at every turn of off-color phrase, and started being impressed with the great things that the men and women we work with are doing to drive our products forward?<p>What if we spent just one week focusing on that. Maybe some of Julie's paper cuts would get a chance to heal. Maybe then we would learn what we can really accomplish together. Maybe we would never look back.",1364189918

I have no first-hand knowledge of how it is in rural scools. Also, anecdotal evidence, so feel free to take it all with heavy dpo<p>Math and the sciences in school: Every memory of school I have has girls and boys in equal measure doing well in math and science. The teachers's pets are all the kids who do well in class, the well-behaved ones who were focused on studying. In our early teens though, you could actually see the girls doing better than the boys in every subject. This pattern continued through college as well. Most guys handled\nthis situation by relying on their female classmates for notes and help with schoolwork. I did the same.<p>College: My engineering class had something like a 40% female to 60% male ratio. This varied\nby specialization. The mechanical engineering department had a grand total of 3 female students and a 100 male students. (This was because Mechanical Engineering was perceived as something physically demanding, and the jobs involved factory floors in far-flung remote towns and villages.)  The computer science department had somewhat more than a 50% female student ratio. On the whole, apart from the Mechanical Engineering department, every department was hovering around a equal distribution of females and males. Note that this was not deliberate on the part of the administration. Engineering school admissions in India are purely a function of score in State-level and National-level entrance exams. \nFor that matter, the faculty was also a fairly even mix of male and female teachers.<p>From the OP's post : ""At an old job, someone in authority pats me on the head to dismiss an argument Im making about something at work.""\nIn an Indian setting, this would be near impossible because Indian culture is terribly touchy\nabout men touching women in general. So the condescension would probably be expressed in some\nother manner, possibly verbal.<p>Plus, with close to half the employees being female, there's never really a sense of female\nco-workers as a minority in the workspace. And even in the few all-male teams I've been a part of, most of the men have spouses or sisters who work in tech. This means that no one\nthinks of male techies as the norm over female techies.<p>Conferences: Just like the workplaces, there's a good mix of men and women at these. And alcohol is hardly ever an issue because no one serves alcohol at these events in India, not\neven beer. It's a bit of a social taboo.<p>Another thing to note is that in India, engineering, and specifically, software, is something\nof an aspirational field. It's considered one of the most desirable careers, and everyone\nwants in.",1364188197

I find that it has much simpler rules, more complex strategy, more varied games, less memorization at my level, has a good handicap system, and uses areas of your brain that chess simply doesn't.<p>But in the end it is a game.

5435573,comment,5434874,5434874,35,0,robomartin,,,"I've been playing chess since childhood.  These days I play on and off exclusively through Fritz using their online service, of which I've been a member since inception.  I have also taught my kids to play chess.  They have entered local tournaments starting at age six and have nearly always come out on top.  They usually have to play one or two divisions above their age grade due to the skills they have developed.<p>And yet, after a couple of years of them playing tournaments and taking classes from our local master I pull them out of the entire thing and only allow them to play an occasional tournament here and there for fun.  Why?<p>Because playing lots of chess only makes you good at playing chess.  Yes, you learn deep concentration, situational analysis, etc.  However, these skills do not translate linearly to other activities.<p>Playing blitz chess does not make you better at avoiding an accident on the freeway when things get out of hand.  In other words, you don't become some kind of a super-fast general-purpose thinker.  You simply become really good at fast chess.<p>The same is true of ""traditional"" slow chess.  Again, the skills you learn seem to be focused around the game and very little of it translates to the outside world.<p>There are teachings that do, for example, one mantra I repeat to my kids while learning chess and try to reinforce in other activities is:  ""Is there a better move?"".<p>The other problem with chess study is the fact that in order to move past a certain level you have to become a human chess database.  I personally detest that paradigm shift in the game.  Yes, you have to know how to analyze the board and evaluate positions, of course you do.  However, without committing to memory a huge library of openings, end games and even mid-game strategies (and specific move sequences) you simply can't get past certain thresholds.  This, from my perspective, is an absolute waste of time, talent and effort that no kid should be subjected to.<p>Please consider this to be my opinion and only that.  Don't be offended if your position is diametrically opposite mine.  It's OK to disagree.  Life goes on.<p>The first couple of years of learning chess can be fantastic if, and only if, they are used as a conduit for learning important lessons.  For example, teaching kids to deal with loosing can be a part of this.  Teaching them to take a situation apart to examine the pieces is critical in nearly every engineering discipline.  If you don't take the time to make these connections while teaching chess then all you are doing is teaching chess.  In other words, the connections will not be magically constructed by your kid simply because they can now check-mate another kid.<p>What should kids have a really good grasp of?  Lots of things, but if I had to name three it would be Mathematics, Physics and Programming.<p>Math gives you the most fundamental toolset you'll need for just about everything, from balancing your checkbook to building a rocket.  Very important.<p>Physics connects math to the real world.  If taught correctly kids get a real ""touch-and-feel"" sense of how things work and why.<p>Programming, again, if taught correctly, teaches, at the most fundamental level, about problem solving.  How do you take a seemingly huge problem, break it into a bunch of little components and methodically solve each one of them.  And it can teach quick real-world problem analysis as well.  For example, I've done things like play ""if-else-then"" games with my older kid where we break down the things that could happen if you place a glass too close to the edge of the table.<p>That said, chess is great.  And, in moderation, as a conduit for learning other ideas it could be fantastic.  Nothing wrong with that.<p>BTW, there's an interesting connection between Steve Jobs and Armenia:<p><a href=""http://tert.am/en/news/2011/10/06/jobsarmenian/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tert.am/en/news/2011/10/06/jobsarmenian/</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+jobs+armenian&aq=f&oq=steve+jobs+armenian&aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3.4229&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+jobs+armenian&aq=f...</a>",1364187711

My personal beef is that TechCrunch is a 'serious journalistic entity' when they get documents leaked to them, but the second people start trying to hold them to the standard of real journalism suddenly it a blog.  It's difficult to pinpoint, but there's something two-faced about TechCrunch that I don't like.  It's some combination of the sensationalism, exaggeration, and in some cases outright fabrication that really get to me.  Since Arrington is the founder and figurehead of TechCrunch, my feelings about the blog naturally extend to him.<p>The fact that page views and advertising revenue are the ultimate goals is fine.  I applaud TechCrunch and Arrington for being successful.  That doesn't mean I have to like their methods.  Google was successful through technical merit.  They never did anything flashy and eventually won because they were better.  I'd like to see a startup blog succeed because of journalistic merit, instead of link-bait headlines and baseless speculation.  TechCrunch has its gems to be sure, but there's too much garbage there for me.<p>An example for your consideration:<p><a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/22/the-secret-strategies-behind-many-viral-videos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/22/the-secret-strategies-b...</a><p>For those too lazy to read, it's an article about making viral videos.  Some choice advice: <i>""Content is NOT King, Make it short, Make it shocking, Use fake headlines, Appeal to sex""</i>.  It also goes on to tell you how to spam yourself to the Most Viewed page on Youtube.  Arrington is the founder and an editor, so either himself or someone he appointed approved this article for publication.  That's why I don't like Arrington.<p>Perhaps the reason why people don't hate Paul like they hate Arrington is because Paul has produced things of value?  Hell, having the PDF of <i>On Lisp</i> online available for free is more valuable than the aggregate of TechCrunch's entire publication history.<p>EDIT:  Hate is a strong word.  If you hate anyone over the internet for any reason, that's pretty stupid.  Dislike is what I was getting at.",1253652835

Those are subjective and different for everyone as well, and the idea is that it averages out over lots of people.<p>No, the problem is that people can't be bothered to spend time to think about just <i>how much</i> they like something, compared to everything else, and that it can become uncomfortable to try and do that because you realize that your relative liking may not be neither constant nor consistent, and trying to make it so could be a lot of work (I like A a lot, but B even more... hey, C is <i>really</i> cool!

837892,comment,836785,836994,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I know a fever of ~40.5 or 105 when taken orally <i>is</i> a medical emergency, you shouldn't even waste time calling anyone before sticking your kid in a car hugging every icepack you've got, because the problem won't be brain damage it'll be death. A fever over 41/106 when taken anally is hyperthermia and can lead to the rapid breakdown of cells (likely the girl's brother got brain damage either through braincell death if he had a severe fever, or his fever was associated with swelling of the brain, which usually shows with uncommonly intense headaches/migraines).<p>From what I remember, if your kids fever ever gets over 39/100.4 (obviously if they're a baby or infant you should call <i>your own</i> doctor for any fever and follow their orders) you should call your family doctor, keep them cool (cold clothes and such, nothing severe) to keep them cool and do what the doctor says. Over 40/104 (and this is what my mum did to me, she's a nurse) she kept a cold bath and had me sit in it for 5 minutes or so, before laying down in bed with cold clothes and IIRC sometimes even ice packs to keep the fever dipping under the 40's. Over night my fever broke and stayed below 40 and my family doctor said I'd be fine. She even said, the only reason she kept me out of hospital was because doctors treat a fever with everything <i>but</i> cold until it's a last resort. I wasn't a particularly happy kid having been dunked in a cold bath all night, but I'd certainly have been more uncomfortable for a lot longer in hospital, but I had a nurse with over 20 years of experience (a considerable amount more experience than the junior doctors they leave on staff at 3am).<p>Personally I believe, a paediatrician shouldn't have got into the job if he didn't expect panicked phone calls all hours of the night.

If it's dumb for a company to make assumptions about a developer because he's certified, it's dumb for a client to choose a company based on the percentage of developers who are certified.<p>> Playing an averages game, that at least means that somebody in the company is going to know when corners are being cut, rather than just having a group of people hacking along.<p>My argument is that this is completely false. In fact, I suspect that there would either be zero correlation between cluefulnes and certification or actually a negative correlation. The reason for this suspicion is both from looking at certifications required for other disciplines and looking at the best developers I know, all of whom have little to no use for certifications and are too busy doing awesome stuff to bother with formality and process (yet whose code consistently has the fewest and least severe bugs and is the most unit-tested of any code in the repository).<p>There's certainly no question that a certification process could weed out maybe the bottom 5-10% of all developers if all professional software developers were required to take it. But the nature of software development is such that <i>these developers are not the ones in danger of causing the collapse of civilization anyway</i>. I would guess, and this is just my guess, that it's the ones who are in the top 50% but not in the top 10% who tend to wreak the most havoc: they have shown enough skill to be given important tasks, but due to time constraints or inexperience or whatever they make mistakes or cut corners.<p>Thus, if I were a client, I would be more interested in choosing a company or supplier that has a policy where any code checked in must be reviewed by at least one experienced developer. I'd be interested in making sure that they write repeatable automated tests and use code coverage tools to ensure that their tests are testing what they think they're testing. I'd be interested in making sure that they had a mentoring program that allows new hires to be taught by experienced developers.

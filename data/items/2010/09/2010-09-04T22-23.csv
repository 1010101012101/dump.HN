1663594,comment,1663026,1663459,0,0,dasil003,,,"Look, far be it from me to always be chasing and advocating the new hotness, and declaring the ignorance of the dark ages (ie. 5 years ago), because it's very <i>very</i> rare in technology that something is so utterly and dramatically superior in every technical aspect as Git (or Mercurial, or Darcs) is over SVN.<p>I'm not going to write the usual dissertation, because I've done it before, and I personally could not care less what you use in your shop.  But suffice it to say that subversion conflates the notions of repository, directory, and branch in such a way as to leave the entire system crippled beyond hope of repair, and it will always be full of nasty edge cases internally in order to support this ""simplified"" model.<p>Now I understand there are many many valid reasons why it might be <i>necessary</i> to use subversion, but an easier transition from CVS is not one of them.  As a professional developer you undermine your credibility in the community when you say things like that.<p>Version control is a developer's bread and butter.  Investing in using one of the good ones may be the single greatest skills ROI a developer can get.  Unless you understand both git and svn intimately, you won't grok this, but let me state from hard-won experience that in SVN you can occasionally hit nightmare scenarios requiring days or even weeks to sort out a problem that could be solved in under an hour in git.  Similarly, many minor hassles in SVN (such as hot fixes) become trivially easy in git.  Finally, git's repository model lends itself to better understanding and knowledge transference to other VCSes, because the conceptual model (not the UI) is elegant and well-defined.  I understood git's internals after 6 months of daily use better than I understood the internals of SVN after using it for more than 6 years.<p>Okay, I guess it was a dissertation after all.",1283640924

The numbers are as shockingly big as in thermodynamics. And for real problems, it's not just one matrix, but thousands, all interlocked.

I know this because I used to be married to one and was involved in that scene on a personal level for many, many years.  Here in NYC, some girls pull six figures.  My ex-wife did.  At one point she was making more than I was.  While prostitution of some variety does exist in the legal strip clubs in NYC, it still was a relatively small number of women.  Most of the girls that I've met and interacted with, which probably numbers in the 100's, fell into four broad categories: college students, party girls, single mothers and poorly educated immigrants. I would call none of them victims, nor would I ever call them exploited.  Most of them are very shrewd, very business minded and are capitalizing on the only resources really afforded to them given their individual situations.  In fact, the only sadness I feel about the entire thing is for the lonely men lining up to swallow whole the illusion that within the walls of these places they are wanted, sexually attractive, etc.  It is pretty depressing to watch.",1283638841

Doesn't make one of you superior to the other.

Maybe unit tests work well for large companies, and I would think they might be ideal for parts of certain types of server applications.<p>But I have tried the methodology, and found that it slows me down and produces lower quality code.  For me, it produces a lot of false positives as the some number of unit tests become out of date each sprint, and the significantly increased overhead slows down development significantly which means less quality functionality per unit time gets developed.   I've tested this theory with a real product written %100 solely by me, and found that the actual results in production where there were no unit tests and no design documents (but lots of design ""notes"") resulted in a shocking result: Not a single exception over a large deployment among thousands of customers and many months and only one reported bug which at the end of the day is actually working correctly but the design decision was not clearly thought out and the software does something the user doesn't expect in a corner case.<p>Here I see people talking about refusing to hire people who don't believe in Unit tests, and everywhere else on the planet I see people talking about Unit tests as if they are a religion, and as if nobody could write competent code without using them.<p>But realize this, every programmer is different, and the path to the highest quality code per unit time may not be via unit tests.",1283638705

Take Haml, which uses CSS selector syntax to reduce the amount of HTML boileplate to a bare minimum.<p>The common factor of these engines is that your end up writing less code than plain HTML, and unlike this new engine for ASP, the mixing of code and presentation doesn't look completely horrendous.",1283638313
1663507,comment,1663381,1663381,0,0,jules,,,"It is very much dependent on the kind of code you write. If you write UI code then automated testing might not help you much. But for algorithmic code you can usually write short tests that test very comprehensively and catch nearly all bugs.<p>For example if you are writing a sorting function you write some code to generate a random array, sort it, and test whether it is sorted.<p><pre><code>    n = random int;
    A = int[n];
    for(i in 0..n) A[i] = random int;
    sort(A);
    for(i in 0..n-1) assert(A[i] <= A[i+1]);
</code></pre>
Running this kind of test saves you a heck of a lot of time manually testing scenarios, and it tests much more comprehensively too. Tools like QuickCheck make this style of testing even easier by providing ways to randomly generate things and if it finds a bug it tries to get a small example that produces buggy behavior.<p>I do not see much value in the kind of testing a lot of people seem to do though, for example in a web application putting something in the database and then testing that it's there. If the test is about as complicated or more complicated than the thing it's testing that is a good sign the test is not very useful.",1283638288

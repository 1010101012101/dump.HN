440368,comment,440269,440351,0,0,mixmax,,,"It's a very interesting thought. The problem may be that there aren't really anyone in the vicinity of entrepreneurs that have an interest in saying that it probably won't work out: Investors lose their money, partners lose their partnerships, etc. And friends often tell you you're doing great in an attempt to spur you on.<p>It might be possible to set up some system that you can judge yourself by. Maybe a quiz that you can take every month that is developed by psychologists, entrepreneurs, and VC's with questions on your progress, motivation, financials, etc. Your score reflects your chances of success, and you can track it from month to month. That way you will see more clearly whether things are going well or to hell. It would be like with small children: If they are your own you don't notice how quickly they grow because you see them every day. People that only see them every month notice right away.",1232365707

Is something worrying you?<p>The easiest way to solve it:  exercise and/or eat more.  This reduces stress and anxiety.  It's easier said than done... I find insomnia (and most things in life) to be a feedback loop.  Less sleep means I'm more exhausted and not hungry.  More quality sleep gives me more energy to exercise and I eat right.  So you've gotta do something that changes in which direction you're regressing.<p>It should be noted there's a difference between insomnia and sleep phase disorders.  One is actually whether or not you sleep soundly for enough hours a night, and the other is at which hours you tend to sleep.<p>But take my advice with a grain of salt.. it's 6:15 here and I'm still awake :)",1232363773

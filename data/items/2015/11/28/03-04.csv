Sure, they can follow step by step instructions, click things together but they are learning very little.<p>Most kids learn nothing about strength of mechanical shapes by clicking together lego blocks.  However, a curriculum that explicitly teaches how different structural shapes behave under various loads does teach them a lot.  Ergo, the vast majority of kids only learn so much by following lego assembly instructions kit after kit.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that these toys are not useful.  They are.  What I am pushing back against is that the cost of the educational toy or tool is directly related to the level of learning it can provide.<p>BTW, I do think that &quot;little bits&quot; can be useful with the right curriculum.  Yet, we are talking about $200 again.  This only strengthens my argument that a dive for the bottom it utterly meaningless when it comes to delivering usable value, either for education or for other applications.<p>In the case of poor countries or really poor people, yes, of course, lower cost could be the difference between access and no access.  Yet, that&#x27;s not the whole story because they need to spend at least $100 to play.<p>Is that the primary argument and mission of the various Pi boards?  To serve the poor?  Because, if it is, then I&#x27;d like to understand why it uses a video interface that requires fairly recent monitor that will cost somewhere around $80 and $100 in the US.

The effectiveness of government agencies to do their jobs serving citizens is related to how much citizens trust them to do that job. If you don&#x27;t trust cops to protect you, you won&#x27;t call them when there&#x27;s something bad going on, thus they won&#x27;t be able to protect you. It seems to me that you can, in principle, reach the point of so little trust being given to the system that the system suddenly disassembles.<p>If public trust is an important part of effective and good governance, it&#x27;s important to combat the efforts to destroy it, especially if we&#x27;re talking about some statistically insignificant infractions being blown by journalists out of proportion, like it seems to be e.g. with the police brutality issue in the US.",1448682782

10639947,comment,10638468,10639813,0,0,1563565,,,"I am not surprised that you don&#x27;t like exercise. There is a general trend in society to exercise instead of just live an active lifestyle by playing sport, going for walks, helping your friends move house, and so on.<p>Being active develops your body in a much better way as well. Muscles and tendons are much more complex than what is suggested by people who lift weights. Squatting heavy for 10 reps is only going to result in a very specific type of muscular development. Muscles have multiple compartments as determined by the various nerve endings. They have different types of muscle fibres and there are multiple smaller muscles all over the place.<p>It is pretty easy to recognise people who lift weights and don&#x27;t do anything else because their bodies look strange. Many people at gyms have bigger chests than the worlds greatest fighters, bigger legs than the fastest people in the world, and wider shoulders than the fastest swimmers. Their muscles are counterproductive to being athletic as their legs rub together when they walk and so on. It is not just about size, it is about everything.<p>No it was the fault of crossfit. Most likely you had overdeveloped internal rotators which caused impingement due to poor posture. Any responsible trainer would get you to do facepulls and rows and maybe posterior chain exercises like deadlifts to correct your posture before you did overhead work. Injuries at the gym are extremely common because the body is more complex than some people think.<p>Having fun outdoors should be people&#x27;s main source of exercise, not rep 1, rep 2, protein shake. Nutrition is another topic. Weight lifting is to being active as supplements, frozen meals, processed shit is to actual real food. And no you don&#x27;t need 500 grams of protein per day. The whole fitness industry is garbage. It presents these bizarre bodies that nobody finds attractive as ideals and so people try to obtain them.",1448682730

Trust in the legitimacy of government and other members of society is inversely correlated with crime and corruption.<p>This is not to say that trust causes lower crime rates, but when agents of the government behave in ways that break trust and jeopardize the legitimacy of their station, the public is less willing to cooperate and more likely to operate outside of the system of law. Therefore, what is essential is that law enforcement act in ways that preserves trust, especially when the eyes of the nation are upon them. Trust and government behaviour form a feedback loop, such that if either one is maligned, it can disturb the stability of the entire system.<p>I agree citizens are what matter, and that no government agency should be legitimized merely by its own existence. However, I do believe that the enforcement of the law leads to more optimal societal configurations than the Nash equilibrium.

I assume they&#x27;re good by virtue of hiring women. So, company + hires women + pays them well => good company, good company => does well on the market. I don&#x27;t think it stands to scrutiny. I&#x27;m not sure if you mean that those companies are morally good, therefore successful on the market (generally, the reverse is true), so I&#x27;ll ignore this point, but I propose another interpretation:<p>The companies that hire women are the ones that can afford it. Seems more likely, but it would imply that women are less capable than men in this field. Assuming this is not true, with less women than men in the industry, you should expect proportional amounts of them in both &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; companies. It should average out to equal pay.<p>Since it&#x27;s not virtue, and not good companies being charitable, I smell only one other likely explanation: maybe it&#x27;s profitable for companies to hire women as programmers now? If it&#x27;s not because of merit, then how could it be? Maybe it&#x27;s because it is fashionable nowadays to go out of your way to make it good for women, and you risk PR flop if you don&#x27;t?

That is an entirely understandable situation to be in; I was an adult before I&#x27;d eaten good tofu, even growing up in a city that had a reasonably large Asian population. It can be tricky to get it right (when preparing it at home, without a pro gas wok cooker, for most types of fried or sauteed tofu, draining, pressing, and then freezing it provides a nice texture and makes it easier to marinate effectively, as the freezing puts tiny holes in it).<p>As for price, I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s not been my experience. In the U.S., even small cities with limited options, it is never much more than $2/pound, which is, I believe, competitive with most meats, though it has been a long time since I&#x27;ve bought meat (I was regularly buying chicken for my dog a few years ago when she had cancer and had a poor appetite, and I seem to recall it was a couple bucks a pound). Asian markets are consistently the cheapest place to buy tofu, and often have fresh, locally made, tofu for good prices. At least that is true for much of the U.S. and Canada. Where do you live? Is there a &quot;little China&quot; or &quot;Chinatown&quot; in your city? That might be a place to go to check out your low priced tofu options.<p>Other vegan alternatives to meat include seitan (made from wheat gluten and costs about $3/pound to make using expensive organic wheat gluten and organic packaged vegetable broth...I&#x27;ve made it much cheaper than that) tempeh (expensive when packaged but can be made at home with all sorts of beans, including soy), and, of course just eating nuts, beans, lentils, etc. There doesn&#x27;t have to be a slab of &quot;meat&quot; on the plate for a meal to be satisfying and delicious. I&#x27;ve gone years without buying tofu (only eating it when eating out, since it took me a while to figure out how to make it well), or eating any of the faux meats. There are plenty of vegans and vegetarians that don&#x27;t eat tofu. I happen to really like it, especially now that I&#x27;ve learned a few ways to prepare it that are really tasty.",1448681002

The building is closely surrounded by residences. They operated largely outdoors, they woke me and my neighbors up every morning before dawn yelling and throwing stuff outside, and they kept it up until after dark six days a week. A lot of cops hung out there, and the city PD wouldn&#x27;t enforce the noise ordinance against them. In a way, I spent 16 hours a day 6 days a week at Crossfit, for a couple of years.<p>It really did seem kind of like a religion or a cult; clearly the owners and the more serious customers had deeply invested their identities in what they were doing, and were seeking approval from one another. I perceived a kind of aloofness or elitism in the way that they valued validation from the in group over the rights and values of their neighbors. I came to recognize many of the customers, some whom were often there 20 or more hours per week. It seemed that one of the core tenets of the religion was that one must always have an audience while working out, if not willing then captive. Cheering, yelling, throwing large objects like tractor tires, and just generally doing everything outdoors, at maximum volume, in a public space, was apparently mandatory.<p>I worked at home for a couple years next to these guys. I could hear them inside my house all day, which they ran laps around in groups, with the leader shouting commands like a drill Sargent. When I worked in garden they were they there, throwing weights – it was required that all weights be thrown forcefully to the ground, in a dominance display accompanied chimpanzee-like shrieks, never merely set down on the pavement. When I retired to my porch for a cup of coffee, they were there, milling around next to my yard taking about their core workouts and protein shakes.<p>So it was almost like I lived at Crossfit for a while. In principle, I love the idea of a community gym. Now and then I would see one of the instructors cheering on a chunky middle aged person lifting weights, and that was so great it almost made up for it. Almost.<p>They moved away last year. My life has become much more pleasant, and I have had several months to reflect on this strange phenomenon. I value health and fitness, and I&#x27;m really not just jealous because they were more “swole” then me. For what it&#x27;s worth, I ran 25 miles and lifted this week, but you probably wouldn&#x27;t guess by looking at me. I&#x27;m not perfect, but I&#x27;m pretty much where I want to be with fitness – trying to do my best mostly, and not be nut job about it.<p>But is it really necessary to serve up personal fitness with a double side-order of external validation and group identity? Good health is it&#x27;s own reward, and when our self image is so narrowly invested in one aspect of our lives, especially appearances, it&#x27;s easy to overlook other personal growth opportunities. My neighbors muscles were big enough; I think they should have taken a break to work on their personalities.<p>I&#x27;d like to close with a joke: “If a Vegan does Crossfit, which one do they talk about first?”",1448680311

JavaEE is the farthest from &quot;hip and trendy&quot; but you can fire up a 15 year old WebSphere application on brand new hardware and it&#x27;ll work better than the day it was written, with full first-party support for every component that was supported from day one.\nI&#x27;ve seen production code REXX and JCL code from the 1970s which ran System/360 hardware with actual decades of uptime since the IBM mainframe was 100% redundant (literally every component from the DASD to the RAM and CPUs, which all supported hot-swappability for upgrades and failover, all within a 42U). It boggles my mind at how robustly these systems were designed. I.e., the original 360 code was based on a weird-ass 31-bit architecture. Now z/10&#x27;s can run in 64 bit mode, 32 bit, 31 bit[1], or 16 bits with full support for every single application written from (theoretically 1964, but I&#x27;ve only seen code from the 70s still running) all the way up to Clojure and Scala if you want it.<p>Take a look at all those hip Ruby frameworks and look at when Yehuda Katz last made a commit to Merb and you&#x27;ll figure out why CIOs still buy SAP and pay for Oracle. IBM is lucky not to deal with the &#x27;hip and trendy&#x27; demographic- it&#x27;d just further damage their already faltering image in the corporate world.<p>The real market share they should be trying to pickup is not the frivolous Web 3.0ish junk. They instead should be pushing out a POWER8 + DB2 + fault-tolerant (i.e., milliseconds failover, not seconds) for under 250k with an ERP attached to it (partner with SAP Business One, 98% of the businesses doing under 250MM in gross per annum don&#x27;t need more htan that). AIX 7 already has &quot;Cluster-aware&quot; software that does this, they just need to include it by default for up to 4U. THEN, start price gouging. Market it under the name &quot;NEVER/down&quot;, partner with PureStorage or one of the new &quot;EMC-killers&quot;, and aggressively market it like they did during the Watson hype (tennis ad-buys, advertising at LeMons, etc).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ESA/390"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ESA/390</a>",1448680248

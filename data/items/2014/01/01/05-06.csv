Tor avoids some of the ISP-problems by re-encrypting at every step (so you can&#x27;t correlate input and output, except by time/size, which is hard on a busy node).<p>After poking through the FAQ the claim softens quite a bit, into that &quot;normal&quot; users can&#x27;t detect such things.  This I&#x27;ll grant is true.  And they even mention that, if hiding from adversaries who can observe <i>lots</i> of traffic, you should probably use Tor.<p>That said, the FAQ does say:<p>><i>However if one entity is capable of recording the entire internet traffic, he will probably be able to at least statistically sort out where you are connecting from (your IP address).</i><p>which I think I&#x27;ll still disagree with, unless this is provided by DHT (I don&#x27;t know DHT, sadly.

The wealthiest consumers who spend the most often have the best rewards programs and carry no balance. But you&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s a revenue stream that factors into it. There are other sources too, like penalty fees.<p>At the same time, some cards &quot;magically&quot; do more than 1%.. they do 2% or even 3% in some cases. You can guess where those funds come from.<p>But don&#x27;t miss the bigger point here. The card issuer market is a competitive one.

I saw most of it go down.<p>First, it is important to understand the OMI is a school politicized through and through.  Jerry Brown has deep connections to the school, having financed much of the schools on-goings and involving himself continually in the school&#x27;s decision making.  The school has performed alright but not as well enough, it seems, for Jerry Brown.  The governor&#x27;s displeasure does have some merit considering the copious resources the school possesses in areas like staffing and technology.<p>It appears now that the governor personally approached Udacity in hopes that they might be the solution to the school&#x27;s lackluster performance.  The folks at Udacity appear to me to have been genuinely naive and unfamiliar with the urban charter school world.  They apparently accepted straight out what the school told them about student skill and motivation levels.  So I believe they were genuinely confused when algebra repeater students turned out not have the pre-algebra skills they were supposed to possess but instead had skills often not much beyond elementary school level.  I also think they were truly stumped by the student data that resulted from the school secretly asking adult student-aids to do the work for them, a commonly practiced form of cheating throughout the country in online credit-recovery courses.<p>Sometime after the whole Udacity experiment went south, I spoke with one of the faculty members more involved in the courses.  This faculty member suggested that the Udacity representatives did realize at some point the reality of the mess into which they had allowed themselves to be led.  However, also being aware of the politics of the situation and not wanting to offend the govenor, they permitted themselves to be scapegoated.<p>In the end, I suspect that Udacity is just happy to get back to it&#x27;s original noble mission of providing free, high-quality, career-oriented online-education to the world and forget this small ill-fated diversion.",1388555425

For example, take your first point, filling out forms. It used to be you always had to do it. Then contactless payments took off in Asia. There was all this buzz about NFC and how it was going to disrupt the system and mobile carriers were going to get involved and so forth. So what did Visa/Mastercard do? They just relaxed the rules so that swipes under a certain amount don&#x27;t require a signature. Poof, there goes the opportunity, because there&#x27;s no way the cost of an NFC rollout is worth the extremely minor difference between a swipe and a tap. (Go ask Google Wallet.)<p>And so it goes for most of the technical issues, I think. Trust and security too.. you could make it easier on the merchant, but at the same time harder for consumers to recover funds if they &quot;did something wrong&quot; like installed malware.<p>Excited about the new frontiers into digital cash though. And also scared too. The biggest use case for bitcoin right now is not payments. It&#x27;s international money transfers that skirt capital flight controls. And, for us non-libertarians, it ought to be a big concern. It&#x27;s a profoundly anti-democratic force. It gives the wealthy minorities (esp. in third world countries) a veto power over policy. Don&#x27;t like some new environmental or safety laws, or higher taxes to fund public education and health? Just transfer capital out of the country and watch it wither.",1388553954

Most of the problem with MOOCs is that the courses just aren&#x27;t engaging without classroom participation by instructors, and most of them have no penalty for failing to complete the classes.  Hell, I&#x27;m pretty sure I signed up for that MIT course.  Then real life got in the way, and I was spending about 60-80 hours a week trying to get a project out the door.<p>I think the best solution is to have students learn at their own pace using MOOCs and supplement that with teachers in classrooms.  I remember that I was way behind in classes until I hit 2nd or 3rd grade, and then our teachers allowed us to work through various workbooks at our own pace.  Within a couple weeks I not only had caught up to my peers, but I was outstripping them at a very fast clip.  I think that a lot of really smart kids probably have similar issues... the pace of lowest common denominator teaching which dominates both public and private classrooms can cause really bright kids to be frustrated and ultimately apathetic.<p>There is a social aspect to schooling that causes a lot of hangups with both teachers and parents alike.  Kids who are smarter than their peers have no recourse other than being pushed up grade levels, which brings about its own set of negative challenges.  By creating a system where students can learn though MOOCs and have teachers who can aid them, the 3rd grader who should be learning at an 8th grade level can stay with his age group and get that social education which is ultimately just as important as the mathematical and science education.",1388553520

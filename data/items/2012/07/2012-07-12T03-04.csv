4232927,comment,4232104,4232557,7,0,tokenadult,,,"I see multiple comments from men here about how women they know buy impractical clothing and shoes that are poorly made and don't last well. I'm happy to report that whatever the general pattern is, there are happy exceptions. Some women I know (for example my wife) and some girls I know (for example my daughter) seek out clothing and shoes that are well made and hold up to heavy use in outdoor exercise. Just the other day, my wife asked for advice among a Facebook private group of mutual friends about good garments to wear while bicycling that are also suitable business wear for teaching piano lessons (her occupation). She loves to bike to the homes of clients (her preferred location for delivering lessons) whenever she can, year-round. She invented her own outfit built out of clothing items she already had after receiving advice from friends to ""buy [Brand X]"" or ""buy [Brand Y]."" She takes a hacker's approach to clothing and fashion, and tests the boundaries of what is possible with the resources and constraints that she likes.<p>We both like taking walks or bicycle rides together. I ask her for advice about shoes for both purposes.<p>P.S. When I lived in Seattle in the very early 1990s, I was told that Nordstrom's was known as ""Rent-a-Shoe,"" because the generous return policy at that department store meant that a woman could buy a pair of shoes to attend a fashionable party, wear the shoes just once, and then return them without hassle to the store. I don't know what current policies are at Nordstrom's, but it does seem that fashionable shoes for occasional use have long been a mainstay of the store's business.",1342065560

4232910,comment,4232044,4232533,5,0,keithwinstein,,,"It's an arms-length negotiation by sophisticated parties. Some cable channels (like CNN and ESPN) can command big fees from network operators because consumers expect that these channels will be available on a cable or satellite system. Some cable channels (like, probably, Animal Planet) have to pay the operator for the privilege of being carried. Some cable channels (like HBO) are able to produce higher-quality content _because_ they have the benefit of predictable revenue from subscriptions and are not as dependant on advertising or per-show viewership.<p>But it doesn't do much to sit outside the negotiations and decide that you are offended by how the deal shakes out. Which way the money flows depends on the relative bargaining positions of the two parties. Yes, DirecTV is providing Viacom with a service -- operating the satellites and dealing with individual consumers and billing them. But Viacom is also providing DirecTV with a service: producing TV programs and channels (including Comedy Central) that consumers want to watch and are the reason they subscribe to DirecTV in the first place!",1342065143

Everyone just interviews at random places until one randomly hires you.  The secret is to continue job hunting after you've started, don't sign anything, and be prepared to walk if the culture turns out not to be something you can tolerate.  And I say tolerate, because there will never be a 'good' culture.  It's a job and your exit strategy is to not work any more.  People are going to say their company is different, it's awesome, but they don't even know what makes it such a horrible environment.  For instance, any culture that has a strong affiliation with kids stuff sucks to me: scooters, bikes, slides, candy, games, nerf, etc.  It really says that they see adult employees as introverted children who are stupid enough to do real work so they must like candy and scooters.  Other people like this kind of stuff, but that same company is going to have something else seriously wrong with it that they won't like.  Just pick some place you can tolerate until you save up enough cash to escape wage slavery.",1342064746

I own that phone, there are plenty of games. This is just plain wrong.<p>2. Nonsense, plenty of fantastic games. Maybe not XBOX 360 / PS3 level of library, but is that necessary for success? I think not.<p>3. Yeah, there's junk, but there are also a lot of gems. So what, that's what ratings are for. Plenty of crap available on all game systems. This isn't competing on having specific games, but being an open platform. Expensive dev-kit not required. People actually like that, even if they don't use it. I love low-budget indie games. Lots of other people do, too.<p>4. Android already has great games. The games are already there, or trivially easy to port. A lot of developers added support to the Sony Experia Play after the fact when that came out. There's a good chance all those games will work on day 1 on OUYA.<p>5. No real compelling argument here. Android is an open system for networked games, they can work however they work. What's not economically feasible about games running their own servers or having multiple competing server services. These already exist in the PC game world.<p>6. Well the success of current consoles suggest that lots of people still do (and will continue) to game in their living rooms staring at their giant HD screen. I do.<p>7. Specs moving too fast? The XBOX 360 is dramatically ""behind"" in specs (not to mention the Wii), but as we already know, the tech specs of game systems aren't really much of a limiting factor in creating enjoyable experiences.. Hell, lots of people love games made for radically out-of-date consoles. Who is going to be writing games in 2 years for Android that doesn't run on current best-in-class android devices?

If, for example, the stage manager announces via Facebook that there will be rehearsal at a specific time, or that you should bring $5 for the director's gift, it'd be pretty stupid for all 35 cast members to reply ""k"" and nobody does this. But the message needs to reach all of them, and the SM has no idea who's been informed, so instead he gives himself carpel-tunnel texting everyone individually (because there is a social expectation that you acknowledge texts.)<p>A stage manager is in serious trouble if half the cast didn't know to show up, so he'll do it the hard way if he has to. But for large, informal social groups, people who don't use Facebook as actively simply fall through the cracks. I'm part of a roughly 30-member group that gets together to watch hilariously awful movies. We organize on Facebook, and people who don't happen to see our posts get left behind and forget about it. If the host of a movie night could easily see who already knows about it, he can contact the others by phone or in person, increasing engagement with the group while respecting those who silently declined.<p>Being able to see who you've already reached makes Facebook a  pretty massive convenience in cases where it previously had no advantage, increasing engagement with both Facebook itself  and the real-world entities represented by Facebook groups. I'd call it a win-win.<p>>If the other person knows you saw their message, then there's the potential for them to perceive your lack of response as rude or a show of obvious disagreement.<p>This goes both ways. Yes, it does eliminate ambiguity - you saw the message and chose not to respond; there wasn't a technical glitch. But where the person you're talking to would previously have escalated to a more invasive form of communication like a phone call, he now knows there's nothing wrong with Facebook; you're just not interested.",1342062847

I need to say before writing further that I am not interested in the OUYA stuff, but I'm curious to see how it does, and there's probably some kind of market for it.<p>""1. android game list not compatible"" :
There are several apps on Android which enable games working with touchscreen only to be translated to physical controls by simulating touch pressure at precise points on the screen. Of course, this wouldnt work for Angry birds of game such as that, but there are a number of games for which this approach will work.<p>""2. The Android Game Library is Extremely Lackluster"" :
Yeah, maybe. But apparently there's some significant profit happening from a bunch of game creators, if not they would have stopped making games for Android a long time ago.<p>""3. Indies Will Not Fill the Void"" :
Why not? We have seen Braid on Ubuntu store even though it's a tiny portion of the market for games. There will be support from Indies. Porting something to the OUYA will be something fairly easy since the hardware is standard and the environment is already one people are familiar with. Cost of porting will be very low, I believe.<p>""4. The Userbase Problem"" :
They already solved this partly by :
- adopting Android and therefore benefiting from Android market games
- ensuring ports would be easy to make with standard hardware and environment, as my previous point. 
- and it seems, at least from Kickstarter, that there is some strong market interest for it, at least for a niche market.<p>""5. Some Things Just Don't Scale"" : 
Author focuses on online capabilities, but just like on other consoles, you dont need online to enjoy great single player games like Limbo or Braid.<p>""6. Games are Moving Away From the TV"" : 
Yeah, so what? There will still be always a market for TV-games. It's not like everyone is going to stop playing games on a big screen. There will be a market for it. Noone is ever considering that the games' market will be 100% mobile in the years to come. It may be decreasing because of the old business model as well, and the lack of innovation on home-based consoles.<p>""7. Android Specs Move too Fast"" :
Yeah, and so do hardware specs for PCs, yet games usually support a wide range of hardware capabilities, to be able to run in different resolutions and different processors, while still remaining playable. I don't see the big deal there. And nothing prevents them for updating the OUYA every 2 years or something while still keeping game compatibility, something impossible with current consoles.<p>I can't believe someone claiming to be a developper in the game industry wrote that post.

- The biggest change is that you are in charge of your day, not your manager. It is very easy to get distract by the glamour of meetups, TechCrunch, and posting on HackerNews (love that Karma). There is no overlord telling you where to go or what to do. It is you and your company (or idea). Even if you have a CEO and you are the first hire, most likely the founders are going to be busy. They expect you to be an awesome self-starter.
- Work life balance no longer applies. In a startup, your identity is wrapped deep into your company. Your work is your life. Startups require a significant amount of your time, but a TON of emotional investment. Prepare your loved ones for the bumpy road ahead. 
- Most things suck, but a few things are good. Startups prioritize. There are going to be things about your product that suck and things about your product that are great. This metaphor also applies to the entire business. A lot of what you will be doing on a day-to-day basis will end up adding little value to your company. You are trying to figure out your bread and butter but you will lose a lot of loaves and cream along the way.",1342062181

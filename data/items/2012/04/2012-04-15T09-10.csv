In France, they're outlawing surfing on websites that can be called ""terrorist"".<p>That include documenting yourself on ""bad"" countries' culture (bad as in your govt does not like them), or of course, reading phrack's art of exploitation.<p>In Germany using tools such as nmap is outlawed if you're not a security professional.<p>Not need to get started on China or even the USA.<p>Then, take a look at Full disclosure's current activity.

3843288,comment,3843139,3843247,3,0,kelnos,,,">> Email can be secured and authenticated with GPG and perhaps more people should consider doing this.<p>> Doesn't work unless you teach people about security, which is difficult.<p>Simple, transparent security is hard.  But this is again a UI problem, not a failing of email.<p>Think about this for a second: let's say Google decided that it was going to transparently PGP-sign all GMail users' emails.  Now GMail knows that any message with a from address that ends in @gmail.com but without a valid PGP signature is fraudulent.<p>Now let's say Yahoo wants to adopt this too.  So we add some syntax to SPF that advertises, ""any mail coming from this domain must be PGP signed.""  And another field that points to a public key server.  So then all other SMTP servers (or even end-user mail clients, if they want), can auto-reject mail based on this criterion.<p>Sure, this leaves out some details, like people sending mail from an @gmail.com address using their own SMTP server via a thick mail client that doesn't support PGP (or requires complicated setup to do it properly, like most do).  But it's a (hopefully) interesting idea that might work with some modifications.<p>This has nothing to do with email per se, nothing about its successes or failings.  It's just building an easier-to-use distributed authentication system that mail recipients can use.",1334483857

I joined very early (5th, 400 now). I'm however now all set to go on my own. I've found a great co-founder who already has some traction in the space that's dear to me.<p>Having gotten the wind though, my employer has come back with a very lucrative offer. It's loaded with dough, a shiny ""Director"" title, responsibility of multiple teams and enough autonomy, with a moral commitment of staying until the IPO. Very flattering and humbling.<p>It's getting harder by the day to decline the offer. Need HN's help to think this through.<p>Reasons for taking the offer:
1) Dough. ~200K salary + 7 digit-options of a fast-growing pre-ipo company.
2) New title opens up a lot of possibilities. e.g. VP at another fast-growing startup.
3) Staying thru an IPO from the beginning likely doesn't happen often in a lifetime.<p>Things I'd lose if I stayed until 2014:
1) The awesome co-founder
2) (likely) Currently favorable economy
3) Some itch. I'll be 36 by then<p>What else am I missing? This is of-course a personal decision, but I'll really appreciate any words of wisdom.<p>Me: 33 M, a husband, a son, a father of a priceless 2 year old, with 2nd one in the pipeline. Busy enough to not do a startup part-time. Monetarily quite comfortable, but not financially independent. Not keen on buying a house anytime soon.",1334483647

The question is, if it happens and when. I hope it happens as  fast as possible and judging by the development of the ebook world from 1990-2007 and 2007-Now, Amazon is by far more beneficial than the traditional publishers in this regard.<p>Certainly a monopoly is never optimal, but let's worry about that once the future has arrived.

As it stood 33% would go to an illustrator, 33% to an idea guy and 33% to me. Reviewing the situation it was obvious that only I was really bringing anything to the table (experience in the mobile market, numerous shipped software products) and that I could replace the others easily (plenty of ideas, ongoing relationships with freelance artists). Neither the illustrator or idea guy had an experience in mobile or games. So, it was likely to end up that I would contribute most of the knowledge and 80% of the work -- all for 1/3 of what I would make doing it on my own.<p>My point is you have zero leverage as an idea guy. If you have more than that, say, you're an artist, have plenty of money on hand or have some other skill that will make your business successful, you should talk about that. I doubt any programmer is willing to invest her time (which will be substantial, ""simple"" or not) in order to figure out if your idea has legs.<p>If you have any chance of making your project successful, you probably also have the mental tools you need to program something simple yourself.

3843208,comment,3842713,3842713,13,0,leif,,,"I am not experienced with javascript, so I don't understand this argument.  Can someone please confirm the following, or explain what's going on?<p>Here is what I understand:<p>1. Javascript will add a phantom semicolon at the end of each line if it seems like you need it, for some definition of seems like.  To me, it sounds like this is so that new HTML writers in '98 wouldn't see their pages blow up when they forgot a semicolon at the end of a script.  It doesn't sound like professional programmers are expected to leave semicolons out on purpose (this is the opposite from python).  The bootstrap authors took advantage of this because somehow screwing with the compiler is in vogue.<p>2. Crockford's tool broke when a semicolon was left out somewhere.  I guess he didn't implement a proper js compiler that covers the entire language spec.<p>3. There's some business about unary and binary ! operators?  Something about sticking a ! in front of your line lets you leave the semicolon off the end?  This sounds utterly braindead to me.  It's no fewer characters, and the thing you're typing is going really far away (at the beginning of a big block of code) from where it's actually meaningful to you (at the end).  Also, it looks like it relies on some fairly convoluted unintended consequences of the spec, that may not be future-proof.<p>Here is my analysis, if the above understanding is true:<p>1. Bootstrap needs to fix their code.  This business of the compiler sticking in semicolons where it thought you meant them is a crutch to prevent stupid errors from being fatal errors in the average case, but that doesn't mean they aren't errors.  Be explicit.<p>2. Crockford should fix his tool soon, not complain about other people's code, and say ""I'll fix it soon, but for now, here's a workaround: just put a semicolon in your code"".<p>3. What the hell.  Are people really doing this?  Is the web one big obfuscated javascript competition?  What happened to writing simple, explicit, readable, maintainable code?  Are we really bickering over single characters and trying to play subtle tricks with language esoterica to save them like a bunch of 14-year old perl newbies?  Man, I hope these morons aren't in charge of my bank account.<p>Overall, I'm with Crockford, but he doesn't need to be this much of a jerk about it.<p>Further analysis, now that I've read it with a decent (non-cell) data connection: allowing gifs in a public issue tracker is a terrible decision.",1334481052
3843207,comment,3840979,3842926,1,0,qxcv,,,"Sorry, I should have been more specific. When I say ""explain operators"", I mean something along the lines of ""To add numbers, you can write '2+5 <enter>' and it will give you 7"". In two to five minutes you can probably explain addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and then link it back to variables. So ""Type 'i = 3 + 3 <enter>'. Now type 'i <enter>'. It should give you '6'.""<p>It seems to me that attention span is the biggest hurdle. You're unlikely to hold a ten year old's attention for more than a couple of minutes if they don't have a solid understanding of why the concept you are teaching is important and how it ties in to the other concepts they have learnt. If you can show them how useful a concept is, they're probably more likely to go and gain a more thorough understanding on their own.<p>> Do you mean 8-16 as an age range or a number of students in the class?<p>Age range. Ideally you would want to avoid having that sort of spread in a single class (perhaps take one class for the 8-12 age range and one for 13-16 age range).<p>> Also, not all kids get excited at the first sight of scale. It often requires taking time to explain things and give different examples of this phenomenon.<p>True, I'm just basing what I wrote on what my friends and I found particularly interesting.

Remember Jobs' comment about Microsoft having no taste?<p>Yahoo! has two faces: the open source advocating, hacking, library publishing, data sharing side we love, and the marketing side, which has a lot of engineering behind it, and gives us the Yahoo! look and feel complete with degree programs, male enhancement, and refinancing offers. Talk about a lack of taste.<p>Cleaning up Yahoo! to Apple's standards would not be easy.<p>It would be like trying to cut down a Winnebago to make a BMW. Possible maybe, but probably not worth the trouble.",1230983784
418332,comment,417867,417981,0,0,markessien,,,"Regarding the fifth item - Apps are going to break the OS boundary. And they won't do it using emulated APIs, but using Virtual PCs within your PC. That is, an x86 instruction set and whatever OS you want running within this virtual machine, and interacting with other apps through some type of environment. Processors are getting parallel and faster, this is already possible right now (I'm typing this from within a Windows XP layer running on top of Mac OS X), but it will become even easier and less problematic very soon.<p>The OS layers are merging. The differences in the OSes are becoming more about eye candy and less about functionality. That will be reflected in the apps.<p>It's silly to invest a million man hours in some huge suite like Office and then all that goes to waste just because another vendor decided to expose the same functionality over different names.<p>Software is going to have to standardize the way all other user tools have standardized. Cars all have the same usage mechanism with different looks. Our OSes are going to go the same way, it WILL happen.<p>Look at Linux - back in 99, it used to handle quite different from Windows. Now most things are the same.<p>The Apps are also going to have to be the same across all the OSes. Some will say that the web is the way to go - but I believe that the iPhone has shown that when people have the choice between native and web, they choose native. Infrastructure does not change that fast, internet speeds are not changing that fast.<p>We are standing on the verge of a reorganisation of software. The big companies are struggling for dominance at this stage by struggling to control the APIs. Soon, it will be possible to write in whatever language and have it compiled to a base API that will run across all the platforms. This move makes sense, and I believe that the easiest way to do it for now will be using x86 instruction emulation - I really don't see any of the big companies giving up their APIs or platforms anytime soon.",1230983331

This site is your solution!""<p>The whole point is the ""afraid of getting rejected"" bit. (Well, I guess there are other reasons besides fear of rejection why you might want someone not to know you wanted to ""hook up"" with them unless it was mutual. For instance: consider someone who has a partner, wants to have an affair with someone else, but doesn't want anyone to know they're willing to be unfaithful unless they won't mind that. I make no comment on the ethics of this.)",1230982770

418325,comment,418309,418309,0,0,markessien,,,"Apple consolidating with Yahoo would create a formidable force, but it's likely not a relationship that is likely to work. The two companies have different styles, they have different markets, they have very little in common.<p>A merger makes sense when the two companies together will function better than if they were separate - Apple can bring little to Yahoo and Yahoo can bring little to Apple. These are public companies, if you want a piece of them, go buy shares in both of equal amount.<p>If you merge two car companies, a lot can be done - designers can be exchanged, common engine platforms can be developed and so on. There is a clear advantage to such a merger.<p>But Apple and Yahoo? What will an OS developer do with a bunch of YUI developers? How will Apples experience designing a music player help with Yahoo Mail?<p>Just because companies are known brands does not mean they should marry. Stop treating companies like they were Hollywood stars and speculating about who is in bed with whom, and who should finally hook up because they would soo fit with each other.",1230982587
418324,comment,417628,417966,0,0,gjm11,,,"The phrase you're looking for is ""network effect"", but I'm not convinced that this doesn't suffer from it. If, as someone else has (fairly convincingly) said elsewhere in this HN discussion, there are a bunch of other Facebook apps doing the same thing, do you really expect each user to maintain lists with all of them? If not, the value is greatly reduced.<p>(I suppose it's possible that different ones consistently appeal to different demographics or something, in which case the effective number of competitors for any given person would be less.)",1230982525

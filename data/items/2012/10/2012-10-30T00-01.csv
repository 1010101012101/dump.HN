4715479,comment,4712628,4712628,4,0,confluence,,,"I saw a comment a few weeks ago where one fellow HNer ran his entire startup on AWS spot instance pricing - so that he was forced to program in a state of continuous chaos as his demand/spot instances popped randomly and continuously into and out of existence while his service was running. It's like programming on quicksand.<p>This is probably a step too far - but maybe it is a natural extension of NFLX's Chaos monkey.<p>If you want ~100% up time with no QOS degradation - your system must be constantly under catastrophic attack.<p>This is probably a major reason why vol based risk models in finance are completely pointless.<p>Value at risk of any investable securities (including cash) is 100% all the time - any other number is bullshit. All volatility based risk models are useful if you like watching squiggly lines or pricing options, but they are essentially a random anchor that helps us sleep at night (anchoring bias).",1351558765

I built it directly into the app, so users could only advance the guide by completing the step described (like, they'd have to actually create a new contact before the guide would advance). A surprisingly high number of people completed the entire thing (~45% if I remember correctly) but very few of those people seemed to actually retain anything. We received way more support requests, and the conversion from trial to paying customers decreased (relative to just showing a video).<p>I don't mean to suggest that interactive tutorials can't ever work, but they were a huge failure for me.

4715464,comment,4713000,4713485,3,0,saintgimp,,,"The problem of standardized testing has a direct analogue in software engineering that makes the situation crystal clear to any programmer - remember when our industry thought it was a good idea to measure programmer productivity primarily (or even solely) by the number of lines of code written? How did that work out for us? Terribly, of course. LOC metrics have a passing resemblance to the thing you want to measure in software engineering but it turned out to be horribly bad at predicting the thing we actually cared about - working software.<p>Standardized testing bears exactly the same relationship to the outcome we actually care about in education.<p>In both realms, there is no easy single metric you can turn to. In the end, you hire great people and get out of their way. The best measurements come from multi-dimensional feedback from managers, peers, and customers.

It's fairly evident that everyone starts as a subtractor, and should not be fired <i>just</i> because they take longer to get acclimated. Dividers, on the other hand, are a kind of person that not only take down companies, but also take down relationships and friends in their personal lives.<p>I've personally spent much of my life identifying ""divider"" behavior in myself and eliminating it so I can commonly identify these types of people. I wonder, however, if there is a third category which would be a subtractor that doesn't wish to improve. This could potentially be classified as a low-level of divider, but takes longer to identify for me personally. I also wonder if these types could have their course altered with the right persuasion early enough.<p>Ex: Someone who makes concrete plans and bails increasingly over time with originally convincing reasons. These originally convincing reasons are visibly full of (not necessarily malicious) ulterior motives once you are familiar with them.
The ""early intervention"" in this situation would have the goal of making the person more reliable by somehow solving their ulterior concerns.<p>My belief is this organizational structure is a driving force for my startup.",1351558424

My current solution consists of:<p>* Readability - things I intend to read soon. Works across browsers and devices, and the simplified text-only view is a boon.
* Bookmarks - I try to roughly categorize by folders, but mostly use tags. I'm not sure why no other browser other than FF lets me add tags to bookmarks considering that page titles almost never represent contents of the page. That and built-in readability-like functionality on Android are some of the things that are making me switch to FF as a full-time browser again.
* Evernote - pages move and die often, which is a problem with Internet as a whole I find. Clipping to Evernote at least ensures access to the page later, and feels a little less archaic than saving the page to disk.",1351558363

One of the most interesting things about her is that she didn't take any interest in languages before her adult life had begun; before that she was a physicist.<p>In one of her books she advocates reading foreign language texts without using a dictionary at all, just trying to figure out the meaning from what little you already know (of course you have to be at a certain level to even try this, although you'd be surprised how little you need to know to start.)<p>This process forces you to think logically about who words are constructed, and to use your own current knowledge to e figure out meanings of words.

While I wouldn't be surprised if teachers work significantly less during the summer, I'd be very surprised to find out that they don't work at all. It rings of the assumption that classroom time is the only work time.<p>Even if they don't work all 12 months of the year, is it feasible for a teacher to take another similar-paying job during the off months? If not, then hourly pay is not a good indicator of income. I can't imagine a person who is only going to be available for 2-3 months, and who has split responsibilities with classroom preparation, would be able to get a non-menial job to fill in the gaps, somewhere along the lines of $15/hour.<p>So taking $15/hr * 40 hours (optimistic) gives $600 per week, multiplied by 13 weeks gives $7800 for the summer.

4715346,comment,4712392,4713041,1,0,csense,,,"> Simple games have no practical use beside the learning in itself.<p>I disagree.  Games are a great starting point.  Creating your own world where the user can immerse themselves and make a variety of choices is way more fun, on a visceral level, than converting Fahrenheit to Celsius or using jQuery to put a few special effects on your website.<p>That fun is part of a reward feedback psychological loop which helps get you motivated, and the motivation helps you study harder and get past frustration.  So the positive effect on the learning process may be large enough to justify such an ""impractical"" application.<p>> games have no practical use<p>Let's not forget that computer/video games are a large, visible and highly successful part of the entertainment industry that essentially didn't exist before the computer era.  We could also say that art, music, movies and fiction ""have no practical use"" -- but a large segment of humanity still finds them compelling enough to spend enormous amounts of time, money and other resources creating and consuming, and these things are widely considered to be a core part of what makes us human.<p>> beginners need to focus on the pure code concept<p>Depends on the person.  I would argue that many people learn better when they can apply their learning to a non-trivial problem.  This is why introductory university science courses have labs.  This is why classes at all levels have large projects in addition to the tiny problems on homework and exams.  In fact, an <i>inability</i> to apply your learning to a non-trivial project implies that the learning process is incomplete.<p>> requires spending attention on entirely orthogonal concepts<p>Most projects in the modern world require interfacing multiple languages, libraries and API's.  Any web app, for example, will likely have -- at minimum! -- parts in HTML, JS, CSS, database, backend language, and a template engine.  That's six orthogonal components.<p>If you're going to be dealing with multiple orthogonal concepts in the ""real world"" of programming, the ""academic world"" of programming (whether a formal college curriculum or just self-learning) would be remiss if it didn't give you some preparation for that aspect through exposure to projects involving integrating different technologies.<p>Even single-language projects involving only core libraries often require putting together different API's (for example, many applications can be roughly divided into dealing with files, dealing with a user interface, and internal core functionality.)  In fact, <i>not</i> being able to modularize a large problem into manageable pieces that mostly treat other pieces as black boxes is a recipe for failure of any and all attempts at large projects.",1351556815

But in principle you can always simulate a quantum computer on a classical computer given enough time -- of course, in practice ""enough time"" may be many orders of magnitude out of the realm of possibility.  So quantum computation isn't a ""new"" form of computation as far as the Church-Turing thesis is concerned.<p>[3] There are purely theoretical machines called ""oracle machines"" -- exactly like a regular computer/Turing machine, but equipped with a (theoretical) hardware device called an ""oracle"" which is able to solve some problem that is known to be impossible for Turing machines, like the halting problem [4].  An oracle machine can be more powerful than a Turing machine, but its violation of the Church-Turing hypothesis is sort of a technicality.<p>Saying ""Build magic hardware that does something a Turing machine can't, and attach it to a computer"" is too vague about how the non-Turing computation is to be achieved to really constitute a fair definition of non-Turing computation.<p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem</a>",1351555981

Chez JJ has been around a little longer, so they are more organized and hold great events; Hacker Fortress is a bit newer and more chaotic, but is more competitive on price. Both have great people.<p>Of the three, StartupHouse seems to be ""trying"" hardest in that the startup-ness is very in-your-face when you walk in. Key articles by Paul Graham and similar are hung up on clipboards, everybody is hacking away on keyboards, and the whole place has a sort of dark, moody, intense feel to it. I only visited once, so take my impressions with a grain of salt, but it didn't feel as friendly as HF and ChezJJ - most people didn't look up or seem to notice there were new people (maybe partly because there are so many people there), and the guy who showed us around was ""on duty"" and looked it. Whereas HF and ChezJJ felt like actual homes and not just places to hack.<p>In terms of physical building, HF literally feels like a fortress on a hill (huge mansion, isolated from surrounding houses, great view). ChezJJ is a cozy, comfy normal house on a street where the houses are close to each other, with fruit trees in the backyard (yum!). StartupHouse is a retrofitted warehouse and feels like it.<p>Whatever place you choose, I highly recommend staying in some kind of hacker house/hostel.

Believe me, I deleted mine years ago and finally had to come back because I realized I was actually hindered in real ways by not having an account.<p>I personally think FaceBook will reach an inflection point where public interest will wane and people will use it less and less... but still have accounts. Then something better will come along and there might be a mass migration. For now though, the reality is it's somewhat essential.",1353005945

No. The money to pay for these facilities comes from gas taxes (mostly), sales taxes, income taxes, etc., all of which are paid by the Uber/Lyft/Sidecar people too.

Probably 80%+ of the material was junk mail that would be thrown away immediately.<p>I've lived in a few countries and there is a special simple pleasure in having a mailbox where (rarely, it's true) only ""real"" mail is deposited. The USPS should be renamed the United States Junk Mail Service as that seems to be their primary function.<p>I needed a first class stamp a few years ago in NY and I asked at the local newsagent if they sold them. The owner said yes, but they cost a few cents more than at the post office. I said ""That's fine, it's worth it not to have to go there"" and he said ""That's what most people say.""<p>The service I have received in e.g. French and Japanese post offices is an order of magnitude more polite and efficient than in the US.

Don't hold your breath, you have not seen the future, nobody has.<p>These are the reasons I don't click on Like anywhere, certainly not on brands.<p>Facebook has been a mess since they have introduced the promoting stories.  They have even added an additional Page Feed, which in my case, has been sitting idle gathering unread counts.<p>Update: IMHO, the best is to use Facebook publicly in a read-only mode.  If you must follow the updates from someone, follow their RSS from their website or their email newsletter, they must have one or the other, or else they are not worth it.  It is also better to keep yourself logged out of Facebook when you don't need to use it.  Twitter is not that bad right now but it still shoots spam messages with bad links without you knowing about it.

4790083,comment,4787266,4789679,6,0,natesm,,,"Well, when TF2 came out, it was laser focused. Every class had a role, and was strong and weak against certain other classes. So now, you throw a bunch of new items, and it loses that. The sniper is weak to spies, that's how it's supposed to be. So then the sniper gets given a shield that makes spies unable to stab him, and a jar that he can throw on the ground and reveal them. Engineers were weak to snipers, but now they can take control of their sentries and manually shoot things outside of the normal range. So the end result is that everything ends up becoming pretty okay against everything. I haven't played the game for a long time so I don't remember everything.<p>The other issue, which is one of the reasons I stopped playing (aside from me pretty much stopping playing video games in general) is aesthetic overload. I don't like the notion of things being called ""purely cosmetic"" because appearances have meanings. The 9 classes were designed to be recognizable from their silhouettes alone, which is pretty brilliant. But now you can pile an absurd number of things onto your character, completely changing that. Not only do you not know what your opponent is equipped with anymore, you also have an additional psychological blocker to identifying them. And it's just <i>tacky</i>. TF2 was originally a 60s spy movie parody, and I really felt that. Now it's just... everything. It's just a lot less compelling to me.",1353005373

It's a lot more complex than that,  but at least there is a theoretical basis to value his work.<p>I spent five years working on a non-profit web site that was used by more than 80k people a day.  We estimated the site produced $250M a year in value for end users.  We also had no real plan for capturing that value or funding it so there wasn't a pie I could claim a piece of at all,  just what they said they could pay me.<p>I've worked at a number of places where the model was spend $X to develop something with Y developers over Z months and maybe we can sell it.  These often are fun jobs.  This includes a lot of Y Combinator kind of companies but also stodgy companies you'll find in midwestern towns.<p>I think the median project of this type either (i) doesn't ship a product in the end or (ii) gets revenue that is a small fraction of $X.  Again,  there's no pie to split.<p>This of course begs the question.  Does working on a project like Colors make you a negative net productivity programmer whatever you do?<p>I guess in theory a place like this could pay you heavily in equity or bonuses,  but with the odds of getting no payout that's really not fair if you have to develop your skills,  be highly responsible in so many ways and maybe even support a family.<p>The companies where the revenue is more obvious are job shops,  but these tend to be horrible places to work.  Of 5 that I had some involvement with,  4 of them were outright failing businesses because the business plan made no sense or they spent 12 years building web sites with an obscure language that is now eol.  The last one is profitable and growing but they had no benefits,  low base pay,  but they might pay a bonus into your 401k at the end of the year based on ""the value of your contributions to the company.""  Well,  the principles of the company never got tried of yakking about the high value of the sales work they do so you know who is #1 and #2 when bonus time comes around at the end of the year.<p>So in all my years as a pro programmer,  I can say I only worked for three months at a place where my work had a clear connection to revenue it was creating and compensation wise it was the worst job I've ever had.",1353004683

I hope to do a lot better and I'm sure other companies have or will as well.

Everyone needs a creative break.<p>Yes,i agree with it, you can't force employee to spend their\ntime with open source project.

They will alway try to improve themselves rather than comparing their team-members.And also it adds value to their resumes.<p>* Why not? Do you have something to hide?<p>Its very inconvenient/annoying, when employee at their free time browsing youtube/facebook,playing a online-game of chess,when someone often comes and looks into their desktop.It will create kind of false impression, as if this employee never works. I bet at some-point, the employee would have given 200% at his task. but something might have gone wrong, then he  will be told to work hard rather than surfing the net. That's not good. We never go and see what founder does with his desktop/laptop :P<p>* This is a common practice and a very important security issue<p>I agree with this, you can remove his email-id from dl so that he can't send/receive mails , but don't block the account.Give him couple of days , so that he download/retrieve any income tax or payslip related documents.

4789858,comment,4788926,4789762,2,0,jerf,,,"Yes, I know the expression problem is old news. <i>So is OO</i>. There are plenty of things coming out that move beyond it or beside it or incorporate it as a thing in the language rather than the thing the language is bent around, but that is still the core idea in OO.<p>And if you carefully read my post again, you'll see I didn't give a definition. I talked about the one element that I've seen that is common across all of them. I can name OO languages with no first-class support for inheritance, no classes, no interfaces, or any of the other things you name, but I can not name an OO language that does not have some first-class binding of a structure to the methods to operate on it, nor can I show you an OO program in a non-OO language that is missing that, because that's essentially a logical contradiction. That's the single core idea that is what OO is.<p>This dodges the ""everybody has their own definition"" problem entirely.<p>Message passing as a primary means of structuring your program and OO are incompatible. One's going to have to be meshed within the other. One's this fundamentally asynchronous, distributed way of programming, and one is an elaboration on structured programming. Someone's on top. You get the same thing between FP and OO; you can put OO in FP or you can put FP in OO (quite popular, Python/Ruby/etc. fit here), but one is going to have to be on top. They can't be peers, they have fundamentally different ideas about what is most important.",1353002865

You can ""send"" a message to an object. You don't know or care exactly what the object does. Other than the polymorphism, the ""message"" behaves just like a function call. It will definitely be handled by your target object, and it will definitely return instantly with a response. The compiler might even be able to inline this function call.<p>As seen in: Pretty much every OOP language.<p>Rank 2: Messages as first-class values. It's possible to write a function that forwards all incoming messages to another object, based on some logic. The caller does not know what will happen to the message. However, the message can be expected to be handled instantly, and it may respond instantly (if it does have a response).<p>As seen in: Objective-C, Smalltalk<p>Rank 3: Asynchronous messaging. When sending an outgoing message, it might be placed in a queue and handled at a later date. The message does not return a result instantly, so agents must have some other mechanism (such as including a ""reply to"" address) to be able to talk back and forth. From the perspective of the caller, it's a bit like putting a message in a bottle and watching it drift off to sea.<p>As seen in: Erlang, message queueing libraries.",1353002602

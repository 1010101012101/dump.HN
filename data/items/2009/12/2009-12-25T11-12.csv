1014954,comment,1014849,1014849,0,0,Corrado,,,"I generally find that asking specific questions about a technology or technique is not really valuable.  My preferred method of interviewing is to sit down and talk with the candidate about ""stuff"", which should include said technologies/techniques.  After a fashion you will get a good understanding of what they know about the subject; where they are strong and where they are just blowing smoke.  You'll also know more about how they would integrate into your team.<p>So just relax and talk to the candidate and don't worry about asking the magic questions that will answer all your prayers.  :)",1261740555

So how can a paper differentiate itself but to provide quality content?<p><i>I think what's new is the ability to personalize the information.</i><p>I agree, but I think it's only one piece of the puzzle. A ""YouTube for value-added written content"" would effectively be a publishing platform that connects freelance writers, content production organizations (like newspapers), and guest authors to their audience. Such a platform would have far more content than any given person could possibly consume, so it would need a personalization system (based on search, a data mining recommendation engine, etc.) But before you get there you have to build a compelling enough platform for good writers to switch to. There's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem here, so it would require a lot of seeding work to be done.<p>Of course this is just my view of it. It seems pretty clear to me, but there have been lots of things that seemed pretty clear that turned out to be completely wrong :)",1261740012

You still have to deal with all the features and idioms you don't know - I remember Duff's device and other forms of switch abuse falling into that category.<p>It is great dogfood, but does lead to some head exploding debugging - you are looking at a piece of badly generated code trying to figure out how many generations back the bug is.",1261739963

1014943,comment,1014548,1014926,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I agree with both of these points, although I don't think of the first situation as ""news"" at all (in a sense that it isn't necessarily dealing with current events that require time sensitive delivery).<p>I think what you're digging at here is that you can't just provide a platform for freelance writers to write their pieces and pay them according to popularity - this model doesn't cover all cases. If there is demand for investigative journalism (which often, but not always, requires funding and cooperation) and reporting from dangerous areas, organizations would have to form that fund these endeavors. But, no matter how profitable this might be, this isn't a scalable business, so it isn't lucrative from a startup's point of view.<p>It sounds like organizations like Associated Press will eventually transition to handle scenario two, which they'll publish via Twitter (once it lets content providers monetize their content), and some newspapers will transition to scenario one (once one top-brand newspaper or a startup builds a value-added publishing platform). The rest of the newspapers will simply die and many of the good writers will transition to a freelance model.<p>Of course this gets very fuzzy very quickly, so most of these predictions will likely not pan out this way, but it seems pretty clear where the overall trend is going - technology will decouple a few concepts that are tightly coupled today. News would be decoupled from high quality written content, and production of content will be decoupled from its publishing and delivery.",1261739048

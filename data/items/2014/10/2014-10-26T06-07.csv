The more social interaction is involved, the less I am affected by procrastination. You have to make yourself visible and accountable to other people, to feel shame if you slack off, to feel energized when you make progress and then discuss it with them. In other words, you need to have a person witnessing you as you work.<p>Think back - in school and while being employed you always had a teacher or boss to witness your work, you had colleagues, but when you are alone with a project, then all this social stabilizing effect is gone.",1414306563

I&#x27;ve worked in one where the floor staff had less than a meter of desk space each. Or clerks in a crappy government department. Or try being a taxi driver. Professionals also have a nice salary that keeps their interest; rarely is it below median wage.

occasion checked at run time against both the upper and the lower declared bounds of the array. Many years later we asked our customers whether they wished us to provide an option to switch off these checks in the interests of efficiency on production runs. Unanimously, they 
urged us not to--they already knew how frequently subscript errors occur on production runs where failure to detect them could be disastrous.

On the contrary, I believe it&#x27;s a bad idea.<p>It has nothing to do with how good your template language is. It&#x27;s simply that a controller&#x27;s main controller (not talking about partials here) has an implicit dependency on the controller, and the controller has a dependency on the template. Unlike, say, data models, the relationship is not unidirectional.<p>But really, what is this separation <i>for</i>? What does it gain us? We generally separate stuff out into declarations and files because it gains us modularity (&quot;separation of concerns&quot;) and reusability. Data models are constantly reused, for example, as are views. But that one template belonging exclusively to the controller isn&#x27;t reusable. It&#x27;s separated out for no particular reason other than the fact that, historically, it has been expressed in a different language and must be parsed and &quot;compiled&quot; separately, so it has not been about &quot;concerns&quot; but about implementation details.<p>React removes that step, and because the template is unequivocally tied to the controller, there is nothing gained by separating them. The point of React is that the &quot;template&quot; <i>is</i> the component. The component&#x27;s rendering is intimately tied to how its internal state and data model is wired up because the one half wouldn&#x27;t work without the other, and vice versa.<p>(As an aside, in a well-designed, pure component, there is little state and the component is mostly template, anyway.)<p>(As an aside, most template languages don&#x27;t even let you validate a template&#x27;s inputs — that is, declaring that it requires specific named inputs and what their types/structure are. No idea why, seems pretty obvious defensive functionality to me. But React does this.)",1414305473

8510386,comment,8509154,8509723,0,0,kamikazi,,,"Disclosure: Indian W&#x27;15 applicant here.
Very pleasing to my ears. Few days back @sama also mentioned in one of the interviews to local print about wanting to make inroads into India and I welcomed it. Done properly YC can get nice response here.<p>Some of the challenges or differences about Indian start ups which you might have to address are:<p>a) Visa related issues: This is taken for granted by applicants from EU and other visa-on-arrival countries but it&#x27;s a huge Qn mark for Asians. eg: I still don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re selected for interview will I have to arrange for a B1 or B2? Will we be able to get it within a month? (There&#x27;s an elaborate application process with long waiting periods - US embassy is notorious for rejecting on flimsiest of reasons). If we get selected, I&#x27;m still bit unsure what visa will be applicable for the 3-4 months of incubation period. To what extent YC will be involved in visa process. What happens after that? Some of these things are not laid out upfront in YC FAQ as of now.<p>b) Incorporation: The more you branch out into Asian territories the more likelihood that for many startups it won&#x27;t make sense to incorporate in USA. Or maybe have a dual structure with HQ + subsidiary in USA/$home country (Ours might be dual). On the other hand there are some SaaS cos who have a Delaware co just for ease of seting up merchant a/cs and ease in collecting recurring payments (We still don&#x27;t have Stripe here).<p>I know this comes later in the picture but I think some of the uncertainty around these Qns would keep many an Asian startup from applying.<p>For someone in Boston, if he doesn&#x27;t make the cut, he can always go back to his home and figure our whatever he wants to do after 3 months. He loses just 3 months of his time. For many of us it&#x27;s not easy to decide to upend your roots/family everything for that one chance of making it big only to realise all the wind is out of your sails after 6 months due to some stupid visa/IRS issues or for that matter even FDI/tax guys back in our home countries (eg even huge cos like Amazon India with billions of dollars investment in their Indian arm, are still caught in Indian tax/FDI redtape - they&#x27;re facing an ongoing struggle against authorities as well as entrenched local retail community. They are forced to operate as marketplace and still have to dance as music changes). There&#x27;s a reason why we&#x27;re #134 in ease of doing business and #179 in Starting a business (out of 189).<p>So I think a clearly thought out YC roadmap on visa/incorp in itself would be a huge bump to smart founders.<p>b) The type or quality of startups in India is slightly different than the typical SV co. The typical SV startup goes: Stanform/MIT grads, batchmates, started building a SaaS/app2.0 product in final-year from dorm -- where you first figure out how to get millions of users and then sometimes after SeriesA maybe think about monetisation. Many of them get acquihired, defensive acquisition before making a cent in revenue. The good startups here in India that I like are mostly revenue generating from day one. Enough to have founders earning 3x+ of his erstwhile salaried job. They might not have hockey-stick growth in millions within months. A hockey-stick chart of nonpaying users is as good as 1/3rd of same chart of solid profitable paying users I reckon.<p>c) The way you do due diligence has to be slightly different. Yes there are lot of smart founders but just due to our sheer numbers you&#x27;ll also find more shady characters (which in absolute nos would be a huge jump from what you might encounter in SV, even if %wise same - so a perception problem), so you&#x27;ll have to gradually build up your sniffing skills in other vectors and also set your internal founder-meter accordingly. Plus there&#x27;s a lot more diversity here in social/living conditions hence the founder diversity that goes with it.  Which also means the good founders might be disproportionately outliers on the map which YC or SV references. eg: IIT gets a huge mindshare in SV but I see more startups from non-IITians here.<p>There are lot of similar subtle things from an Indian founder&#x27;s perspective. I know coz I&#x27;ve grappled with some of these until I studied and organically warmed up to an idea so strong that made me jump through all the hoops and decide to go for it.<p>Would be glad to discuss any further - my email is in profile. (or in person alongside YC interview :-)",1414304693

Cynical, selfish people rise to the top, those who optimize for power get it. They self-select. Ambition for power, for control over others is not something people with empathy would want to work hard for.<p>In that regard, things are quite a bit better than they were, say, in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. Eighteenth century Europe brought a kind of reform to business, the new discipline of economics started to hold politicians at least somewhat accountable for forwarding the cause of trade for its own sake. They of course still routinely interfered with commerce in service of their own ends, but this sort of thing became frowned upon enough to become a major issue in the democratic revolutions of the period.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t say that it can&#x27;t be changed, our ability to organize on levels large and small is slowly evolving for the better, and one of the big drivers of that evolution is outrage.<p>At one point in human history, effective leadership was a big stick and the strength to wield it.

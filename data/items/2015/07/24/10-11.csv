Wolfe\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/RichardDWolff"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/RichardDWolff</a><p>It&#x27;s because American Capitalists felt threatened by the Socialists, because the New Deal and a bunch of other things that happened in the 20th century due to unions and Socialist activism along with American elite alignment that scared them and their continued ability to run America for their interest, so they spread tons of rhetoric and propaganda to make Socialism a boogie man, eventually associating it with Communism... and it worked.<p>In general in the United States ideological words get muddled through rhetoric and propaganda until you can no longer talk about them. When this happens it&#x27;s impossible to act on anything because you can&#x27;t talk about it much less come to any conclusion about whether it&#x27;s good or not or if it serves your interests. It&#x27;s a brilliant propaganda technique that seems to have been mastered to stifle any debate about ideology.",1437735566

Does everyone in the USA think they&#x27;re a temporarily embarrassed millionaire?<p>I hear so many horror stories from the USA. People&#x27;s lives ruined because they lost their job, got injured or have some addiction problem. But those same people will curse socialism in that same breath if asked. I just don&#x27;t understand it.<p>I&#x27;m from the Netherlands, and I&#x27;m proud to say I live in a socialist country. It means that if I&#x27;m doing very well for myself, I&#x27;ll give up a bit more than I would&#x27;ve in a strictly capitalist country. Instead of paying 25-30% tax, I&#x27;ll pay 50%.<p>And that doesn&#x27;t matter.

My parents don&#x27;t have any money? It doesn&#x27;t matter, education is free. If I have or get some disability, I will be taken care of. If I get injured, I will be taken care of. If I get sick, I will be taken care of. By the community. Anything else, in my book, is uncivilized.<p>---<p>To those citing governments destroying incentive structures (can&#x27;t reply - your comment is deleted), I strongly suggest looking up the Dutch model for infrastructure. In a very, very summarized example, the government gives subsidy to private/public hybrid organizations. Those organizations compete in the regular market. In order to qualify for subsidy you need to meet the government standards. Think internet companies, hospitals, etc.<p>You&#x27;re perfectly free to set up a 100% privatized hospital in the Netherlands - you just won&#x27;t qualify for government subsidy.",1437734983

I’d like to ask you for an opinion on an idea - source code for Excel. The goal is to give people who create models and tools in Excel the advantages of having a source code to what they are building and maintaining.\nIt is challenging and time-consuming to build spreadsheets that are really solid, minimize the chance of errors, that can be unit-tested and version controlled.<p>The idea is to create a declarative language which lets you describe fields, tables and worksheets in spreadsheet. You are encouraged to use names instead of cell coordinates. For formulas you just use Excel’s formula language. There’s a simple “compiler” that converts that into a spreadsheet.<p>Compared to regular Excel:\n- you can unit-test the source code\n- you can keep it in version control\n- it’s much easier to read and reason about (it’s auditable)\n- the outcome is a spreadsheet that satisfies the best practices (e.g. formula cells are blocked, input cells are validated).<p>What do you think about the idea?

Some people have great vision, some people, not so much.<p>I started starring at a screen in 92 but I was fitted for glasses in 91. I&#x27;ve worn contacts since 98 and 99.99% of the time and my vision has stayed a pretty consistent -3, -3.25 (in contact lenses) since.<p>Some stuff I&#x27;ve learned (about contacts):<p>If you get contacts that last 2 weeks - use new ones in 2 weeks - It sucks - Accuview (the brand I use) are pretty expensive (something like $300-400 for a year supply) but old contacts definitely cause eye strain. I generally change mine every 3-4 weeks.<p>Focus on something in the distance every once in a while. A benefit of being a smoker (if there is such a thing) is every couple hours I... go out for a smoke. Nice 5-10 minute break from starring at the screen.<p>If you don&#x27;t have plans after work and go home and get back to work on freelance or a side project, or whatever - switch to glasses - glasses allow the eyes to breath and help rehydrate them.<p>Drink water! Eyes need water like the rest of the body.<p>Try something like Gunnar Optics maybe? <a href=""http://www.gunnars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gunnars.com/</a> I have a pair and wear them (with contacts) when my eyes are really tired. They help and according to the eye doctor, anything that can reduce eye strain is good.<p>Change your contact solution. I was using Renu solution for a long time then switched to bausch and lomb biotrue and my eyes have felt fresher since.<p>Wear sunglasses! With a UV filter preferably, but anything helps. People give me shit cause I wear sunglasses when it&#x27;s cloudy but when it&#x27;s cloudy is actually worse then when it&#x27;s sunny. The clouds trap UV rays and that kind of weather can be more harmful to your eyes (and skin) then when it&#x27;s sunny out.<p>If they continue to bother you, have your doctor re-test your eyes or put you in a different contact / lens brand. People are so quick to goto a medical doctor for problems, but often neglect going to an eye doctor or dentist. Sucks - most insurances don&#x27;t cover eye or dental, but it is important to get those things checked out.",1437734332

It is so low level that one has to write a lot of plumbing code to take care of error handling and resource management.\nIt&#x27;s also missing pretty much all higher-level concepts that are fast and can make code easier to write, read and less error-prone. Overall, it&#x27;s simply not fun to write C code, there&#x27;s a lot of tedious manual work, and even if you do everything according to the book you might oversee something and have problems. Well-written C++ completely eliminates some classes of problems, just like Rust&#x27;s type system can eliminate even more issues.<p>C is so tedious to write that even if I didn&#x27;t have access to C++ I would try something else first when the need to write cross-platform/performant code would come.<p>The point is: it&#x27;s not appropriate to evangelise C (or any other language) without pointing out some of its major disadvantages.

9940986,comment,9935830,9935830,0,0,reubenbond,,,"The half-assed actor project mentioned by the article is <i>probably</i> ActorFx - which is an interesting project with some cool ideas. For exammple, you could write actors in a mix of languages like Python, JS, & C#. It had automatic state replication after each turn. Actors were observable, Rx-style. Actor behavior could be specified at runtime: you could effectively throw a JS closure into the cluster and it create an actor out of it.<p>I wonder, though why it became stagnant so soon and never gained momentum. I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know, but I have a theory. The team were using some tech which was semi-secret at the time, which they weren&#x27;t allowed to talk about: Service Fabric (known as Windows Fabric at the time). Fabric was in use in projects like Lync Server and Service Bus Server, but no one could talk openly about it.<p>How can you develop an open-source distributed system without being able to mention the framework which makes it all possible? Fabric handles ActorFx&#x27; high availability, service discovery, code distribution/upgrades, and their state replication. It&#x27;s pretty difficult... Forum posts asking what this fabric thing was went unanswered and the people who may have been interested in ActorFx just moved on.<p>Regarding Orleans, there were probably a couple of internal actor frameworks in use at some large .NET houses, but they were never released to the public. I think it was more of a cultural issue than a lack of devs: .NET devs weren&#x27;t used to sharing code.<p>Things are getting better. The community around Orleans is great (come join us on Gitter! <a href=""https://gitter.im/dotnet/orleans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitter.im/dotnet/orleans</a>) and the ecosystem as a whole feels to be gaining momentum.",1437732187

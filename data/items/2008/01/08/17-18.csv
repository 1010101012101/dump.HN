One advantage I think those of us who work for big corp may have is that we can see inefficiencies all around us and inefficiency = opportunity.

96012,comment,95931,95996,0,0,heyadayo,,,"Paul, its important that the Comet community understands how little mindshare we have. If you hadn't heard of the technology after reading thousands of startup ideas, then what chance do we have? Thats compelling enough reason to post what I remember of the conversation. I sincerely doubt my article would make other investors nervous. The interview contents don't reflect poorly on YC, they reflects poorly on our (my partners and I) ideas and the entire Comet community.",1199814170

96001,comment,95931,95945,0,0,mpc,,,"I agree. I'm surprised YC didn't suggest building some consumer facing app that makes use of your comet stuff. There are many application areas that could benefit from real-time capabilities.<p>Also, Paul has talked about how turning a luxury into a commodity is usually a good recipe for success. Most real-time applications are very expensive and use lame desktop client/server architectures. Imagine something web-based and free that does the same thing.",1199812455

Facebook has a shot at it though, they need to do a lot of work and I think could double it to $6 per user per year. Myspace i believe is around $5/user/year now. It takes years and luck to go beyond $3. I don't know why but that's been the magic number. And that's in a popular network, smaller networks generate less revenue. Myspace was at $3/user/year in revenue when they were acquired. Facebook's value is users actually like being on facebook. Facebook needs a social search engine and email platform though.<p>Comments?",1199812401

It's difficult, it's unpleasant, but it's necessary.<p>Ten of the traditional forty subjects of Buddhist meditation are the <i>asubha</i>, the ""repulsive subjects"", corpses in different states.

We've been around for 8 years now.  Some advice, from my experience:<p>1. Long term support is what organizations need.<p>It's a rare software project that doesn't need some kind of support.  If there's no one to call when it breaks, or needs to scale, or when a new staffer shows up and the previous one didn't train them (happens all the time), then they will stop using it.  It's possible for a well meaning developer to hang an albatross around the neck of an organization by building something they depend on, but not have any support plan worked out.<p>This can be mitigated by hosting the applications for the clients, in exchange for a hosting fee.  If you don't host it yourself, then you have to deal with sysadmining unfamiliar boxes in a crisis situation, where the problem could be a change anywhere on the system.  No fun!<p>Along with hosting, offer a help desk at an hourly rate. Nonprofits really benefit from this because they have a lot of turnover, and you end up becoming the institutional memory for the organization's tech.  Even if you have turn over too, chances are there's a better understanding at your tech shop of what is going on.<p>2. Cheap is better than free.<p>Pro Bono sounds noble, but I've found it leads to... bad things.  There's something that changes in people's mindset when something is free.  Client expectations can become extremely unreasonable, and it's hard to polish something when you're not getting paid.  Where ""done"" is becomes extremely vague, and you would be surprised at how doing someone a favor can end up making everyone unhappy.  So charge money.  Be cheaper than industry standard, much cheaper if you can, but make it a real project with a real budget.  This helps everyone to prioritize.<p>3. Nonprofit might not be the best business model.<p>The main disadvantage on being a nonprofit (at least in the US) is that you cannot work on political campaigns.  We're a workers co-op instead.  It's been working out pretty well for us.  However, we've never tried to be donation driven, so I'm not sure how that would factor in.  I think you should look at a balance of donations and charging for labor, and find the business model that supports both.  Or have two organizations, a nonprofit and a co-op, to handle the two different revenue flows.  It think getting direct donations and grants will be hard.  At any rate, that money will come with a mandate of some kind.  So I would encourage you to cast a wide net, have a look at co-ops and other business types as well, and make sure you pick a model that can support all the revenue streams you want.<p>Cheers,<p>Ted",1316276145

You must recognize the amount of energy it takes to learn french, and apply it to learning ruby. Your final goal - which for the HN crowd would be something like building a SaaS web app,  is equivalent to writing a novel. \nBut before you get to your novel you must learn how to speak and think in the language. You need to know the vocabulary and how to write sentences and then paragraphs. Start with ruby or javascript, and become comfortable with the vocabulary. Learn about strings, arrays, loops, methods, functions and classes. Understand the basics of input and output.  Commit all the small code snippets or phrases to your rote memory. You need to know what a for loop is in your sleep. Write it over and over again until its ingrained in your memory, until you can write it without looking at any documentation.  This will be the boring part, but you need these tools to continue to the more rewarding states that involve creativity.\n From here start reading small programs ( As a front-end developer I started by reading jquery plug-ins I was using for websites, sticking with ones with less then 300 lines of code). Read every statement of these programs and if you dont know what something does, google it.\nWrite every line out for yourself, making sure you know what everything does. Writing out code it the ultimate way to learn. Do this as much as possible. \nTranslate these small programs into English.  Actually write out the translation. Then a few days later try to write the program yourself by only looking at the translation you wrote. Try to memorize patterns you notice. Think of features you would want to add to these programs- try adding them!  These 300 line programs are like essays.\nWhen you are ready to write you own essay, start off by building a calculator.  If you still dont have any idea how one would go about building a calculator, go back to reading more programs written by other people. When you are looking at other programs try and find elements that you could use to build a calculator.   \nIf you are ready for the calculator then you are transitioning from merely knowing the vocabulary of a the language to creating something meaningful with it.  When creating a program start by thinking of everything you need, gather  all your requirements. I am going to to need to create buttons that a user can press,  I am going to need a method for a plus operation,  I am going to need to store values pressed in an instance variable.  Take your requirements and ideas and build it.\nFrom here, build bigger and bigger programs. As they get bigger they are no longer programs but applications.  Keep reading other code are writing it. Learn about frameworks and databases. Buy books on application development and read them. Try and get some consulting work- If you have a responsibility to a client it will help motivate you.  Create your own small applications, and then slowly morph it into your novel.<p>Writing code is the real key- think of writing at least 50 lines of code a day.<p>This process takes about a year.",1316275735

One advantage you have is that instead of being a programmer, you have expertise in <i>something else</i>. Are their any problems in your own field that you can solve with software?",1316275536
3008331,comment,3008018,3008018,5,0,ilamont,,,"It was wonderful that it eventually worked out, but for some children such an experience could be devastating.<p>One other thing that I wonder about this example is it includes three Caucasian American kids in what I believe is a mostly Caucasian school. There were also three of them, instead of just one, which I think made the adjustment easier. It's comforting knowing a sibling is nearby -- my own kids had this experience when attending a summer school in Asia in 2008 and 2009 -- it was very reassuring for the younger one, knowing his sister was in a classroom upstairs.<p>Another situation I was wondering about: If African or Asian children were enrolled in the Russian School, would they have been able to find their place as quickly as the NYT correspondent's family?",1316275525

A few months back I picked up Python in about 5 days, dabbling part time. Django on top of Python took another day or two.<p>I now consider myself an advanced Python developer. It's actually much easier than PHP, but the lack of curly braces, and strict adherence to MVC were my initial hurdles.<p>I can't imagine going back to PHP at this point, even though everything I did in PHP was highly object oriented.",1316275426

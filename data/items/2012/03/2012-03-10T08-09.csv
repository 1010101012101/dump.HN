3687458,comment,3686840,3686840,3,0,rdl,,,"There's a clear search engine improvement which I'd love, and my friends would love, but I think it's not yet technically possible.  (the tech to do it exists, but it's a big engineering challenge to actually build it in an economically viable way).<p>A way to search (public, private) documents without leaking ANY information (beyond possibly ""I did a search"") to the operator.  DDG's ""trust us"" security policy doesn't really go far enough.  A mix-net anonymizing your query is the best option now, but it's insufficient.  Just knowing someone in the world is searching for a specific piece of information is itself highly actionable in some contexts.<p>USG and other highly security conscious entities accomplish this by having the full search corpus onsite and running the searches on their own hardware.  There's Google Enterprise (which was the most red-headed stepchild product I've ever seen from Google) too, and there are commercial ways to buy the crawl and run an engine on top of it, but this isn't really something even Fortune 500 companies do.<p>Basically, either a permanent ""personal google appliance"", potentially hosted in the cloud using some tricks, or a way to spontaneously instantiate a google each time you want to do a search.<p>Probably the way to do this is to write some interesting sci fi novel featuring the dangers of public search leaking, and also wait for some interesting prosecutions which use search data as evidence.<p>You could actually still do advertising this way, too; just requires some tricks.",1331369591

3687454,comment,3686840,3686840,9,0,ericd,,,"I think personal health monitoring is probably the most important thing on that list. The thing that excited me the most when smartphones started becoming popular was the prospect that they could coordinate data collection from a number of sensors always collecting data - basic ones like Nike+, but perhaps also sensors measuring sleep, taking periodic bloodwork, etc. At the same time, perhaps you could automatically monitor personal behavior such as foods eaten.<p>Personal diagnostics would be an important use of that, but I think more importantly, with a very large public dataset of basic biometric data correlated with behavior data and medical results across a significant portion of the population, we could stop treating human health studies as bespoke one-offs put on at great expense and start treating them as data mining problems. You could begin to spot correlations between behaviors and results that are unintuitive given conventional wisdom. I think that the resulting burst of discoveries would be on par with any of history's great scientific revolutions.",1331369417

3687444,comment,3683588,3683736,1,0,lakamash,,,"...which explains why Linux has taken over the desktop market?<p>Seriously, Linux has had MAJOR advantages, people HATE M$ and the Mac has shown ZERO interest in taking over anything other than the elite market segment.<p>I tried using Linux for a while, and it is a major pain in the ass. I've been using a Mac for everything since 2009, and it is so much easier. I really miss some Windows apps, so I'm going to have to get another machine just to run those apps, and of course I will install Windows. But there are no killer apps for Linux on the desktop.<p>Running a server farm? Of course I'll use Linux. No point in using anything else. But on the desktop, what's the point?<p>If you use Linux, it's like tithing. It's free, but you have to give up 10% of your life just to get by. If you're a sysadmin, that IS your life, and you can kernel hack all day and night. This is why Linux controls the server market.<p>But Linus has no conception of what the average user wants and needs in an OS. For example: if I'm using Linux, I'd like to be able to seamlessly run lots of Windows software. Linux should have an executive suite for Wine.<p>The charitable interpretation of his antics is ""Lilliputian victim"". He sounds like a 13 year old.<p>On top of that, the vitriol is a waste of breath. The Mac broke binary compatibility two times - Motorolla to PPC and PPC to intel. There were VMs available and fat binary alternatives available for both changes, and Mac users and developers just rolled over.<p>Linus does some things very well, but I would not describe him as a model leader.",1331369089

Can you imagine how many people are busy cleaning things?<p>I find it amazing that the difference between tasks like washing cloths and cleaning toilets is so small for humans and so huge for machines. We've had washing machines forever, but we're still cleaning our toilets manually.<p>And cleaning is just one of a large number of tasks that require similar kinds of intelligence. If robotics is able to close that gap, the world changes more profoundly and more quickly than ever before.<p>All of a sudden, most of the jobs performed by untrained people will disappear without replacement. The current thinking is that tasks that get automated are replaced by ""higher level"" tasks, but I think that's not actually what happened.<p>Automated tasks have largely been replaced by other tasks that are equally simple for humans but more difficult for machines. As a result, most people are still doing work that anyone can pick up in a week.<p>If that gap closes, we're in for a pretty difficult but ultimately wonderful transition. People have been crying wolf out of fear of this transition for hundereds of years. This time it's for real.

3687395,comment,3685444,3686161,2,0,indspenceable,,,"To me, this sounds very anecdotal; it doesn't match up with my experience (also anecdotal).<p>Remember, not all courses are made equal. I went to a tech school, and transferred after my first year to a high tier liberal arts school. I had a much harder time with a 050 level into liberal arts course my second year, than I did with a 400 level course on Poetry (of which I didn't have any sort of background in). I found the liberal arts courses at the tech school were aimed towards tech students - meaning, in that specific case, many of them felt somewhat watered down.<p>I would be willing to guess that, as a frequenter of Hacker News, you're more likely to be more active in a tech oriented circle. Growing up, and at college, I was more active among humanities oriented folk; my experience was that the tech folk were good at one thing (whatever they studied) and otherwise just played lots of video games, while the humanities students did every thing + 1.<p>So, all in all - my point is that anecdotal evidence is just that. Technical people can have a broad understanding, but it doesn't mean they do. Same goes for Liberal Arts.",1331366716

They'll probably more than happy to send you an article and a quick summary worded for a lay audience (not to mention talking your ear off about their more recent work...) They're not worried about you not paying the publishers, they want to spread their work around.<p>Another trick is knowing people in academia. Maybe you have a friend who's doing graduate work, or lecturing. You could ask your old lecturers if you went to university and if the paper you're after is in their field. There are also communities like /r/scholar on Reddit, though I imagine some people are against that sort of thing.",1331366689

I'm sure it is but my point remains regardless of the votes. This research is very sparse and the benefits are not quite that clear and the possibility that these fairly unclear benefits could be the result of some kind of mental priming or other the should leave suspicion intact.<p>Given the kind of claims being made, don't we need more than this?<p>OK. Fine. Wonderous possibilities - transhumanism and all that.<p>This is hardly a ""proven"" scientific thing and the benefits are somewhat murky. What I'm seeing on HN, surprisingly, are people talking about buying some contraption that purports to make them smarter and the CONSENSUS seems to be that that is entirely reasonable. Disturbing.<p>More disturbing I'm seeing comments about people experimenting on themselves with crudely crafted contraptions and hurting themselves and others simply offering advice about voltage regulators and the like. This is clearly a ""sucker born every minute"" territory."" I'm really surprised to see this on HN.<p>I get the impression that I could post about some kind of startup in which I am going to disrupt biotech by curing cancer with some kind of Wi-Fi therapy and probably what I would get as a response is hints on how to optimize the timing protocols, reduce latency, and so forth.",1331366449

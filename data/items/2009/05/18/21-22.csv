I personally know how hard it is to isolate all factors and get a decent correlation, and that's just the way it is in medical science, but that's what gives me skepticism.<p>In the ""hard, controlled"" sciences, generally if you can't see an obvious correlation by eye you already throw it out. Statistics are used to quantify just how powerful the correlation is, not to prove there is a correlation at all.",1242683984

However, physicists and computer scientists are both working towards opposite ends, since physicists attempt to generalize a set of observations from the physical world into a law, computer scientists attempt to materialize a set of observations from the abstract world into a set of instructions, called an algorithm.<p>When I open this text-book's ToC it reads like a road-map into the beginning of the mostly unknown Universe of computer programming. I want you to briefly summarize why algorithms are so important, where they came from [their genesis], how you use them on a daily basis, whether or not they're more important than design, and what the formulas of the future will do for humanity.<p>[EDIT] More bluntly, summarize [and categorize, if you'd like] the evolution of algorithm design starting with insertion sort and ending at your heart's content [or AI].",1242683832

Naturally, they were keen to have us running Solaris, so we gave Solaris + ZFS a shot (the DB is Postgres).<p>Long story short, ZFS didn't perform so well at all, so Sun shipped over a bearded expert to take a look at it for us.

Having lived in east Asia for six years of my life, I can recall countless conversations I've overheard in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China in which English words were intermixed into Chinese sentences by native speakers of Chinese speaking to other native speakers of Chinese. I've also heard a lot of use of straight-up English in ""Chinese-language"" broadcasting for local audiences.<p>After edit: I should point out too that most of the modern scientific vocabulary of Chinese is composed of compound words that are formed on the model of English or common European words for the same concepts.

There are strings attached that at least potentially can be used to increase revenue and profit.  Otherwise why do it.  That is why I put the word free in quotation marks above.<p>(Exception, sometimes: doing something for public relations reasons.  That's uncommon compared to what we're talking about here.)<p>If a website requires you to give them an email address before being able to download, I think most people here will recognize that the download is not truly free, despite you not being required to give them any money.  You have given them your contact info, raised your hand (identified yourself) as a potential customer, and given them the right to email you in the future (until you opt out).<p>Another idea, which I've implemented recently in my own business, is to structure things so that the ""free"" offer is structured in a series of emails delivered over time (so 10-minute spam email boxes won't work).  Each email has sales copy encouraging the recipient to buy the for-pay product.  The email sequence has continued value, so they mostly choose to stay subscribed.<p>Some people won't do this.  Guess what: <i>they unlikely to give you money anyway</i>.  If you read the comments of the original post, some poster calling himself ""Heavy Battle Wombat"" explains how basically he'll do everything he can to get around the strings being attached to the free offer.  And if he can't he will go somewhere else instead.<p>So my uncircumventable mailing list will repel him.  Excellent.  He is very unlikely to ever want to pay for anything to begin with.  Now I don't have to waste time and other resources trying to sell to him, and can focus more on serving those who have identified themselves as more willing to pay for goods of value.<p>Let me be clear, I don't mean to cast HBW as spoiled or ""bad"" in any way.  He just has a certain value and belief system with regards to free-as-in-beer software downloads, and IMO there is nothing wrong with how he's choosing to move through life.  Really.  At the same time, it implies he is less likely to be a profitable customer for certain kinds of businesses.  So I'm sure not going to bend over backwards trying to get him as a customer.<p>I'm being a little more pointed and blunt here than usual, because frankly this is important.  It's obvious some people are thinking with their emotions rather than their heads, enchanted by a romantic notion that it'd be wonderful if everything would be free.  (It would, and I'm working towards that world of great abundance-for-all myself.  But the notion is not realistic yet.)<p>If you disagree, I welcome your comments, but please don't expect me to reply if you have not actually done it and can clearly support what you're saying with <i>successful</i> experience.

The documentation (ie the FAQ) didn't cover this either. Oh wait. I managed it somehow but bugger if I know how - I can't undo it. Ah. I see. You have to grab exactly the right part of the annotation - the title (Not the URL, Not the Favicon). The design doesn't lead you to this because all three are in the same grey box, making it look like one drag-n-drop unit.<p>This is my opinion only, but I think the price point for your premium service is too high. There are two reasons I pay for premium service: one, I really <i>really</i> want the extra feature; two, I have a really good feeling about the service and want to keep it alive. Ten bucks <i>a month</i> hits neither of those for me. In comparison, I pay toodledo.com $15 a year for a really important-to-me feature and awesome customer service. Looking at webnotes I would get by with the free features, but if I liked it, I would pay you $15/year even though I am not interested in PDFs. With your price point at $10/month, I'm just not going to. I mostly use this kind of service to collect and organise recipes - that is nowhere as big a deal to me as half my Netflix subscription, which is what $10/month comes to.<p>The .net address in unfortunate. People do type ""webnotes"" in their URL bar then get confused when they don't go where they intended. There is no obvious reason why this is a .net kind of site.<p>I get some overwrite issues on Firefox/Linux in the sidebar. Not a biggie.<p>Hope this was useful to you.",1242681702

If the contents of the page change, we first try to relocate your highlights/notes. If your highlighted texts have disappeared, we add a ""page changed"" notification at the bottom of the screen which contains the text you originally highlighted.<p>3. We do think about public sharing of notes, though our primary focus is on improving research. Several other sites have focused upon social annotations without great success, and so we hesitate when considering such options. Also, the UI does seem tricky. If we were to implement more sharing-related features (you can already share annotated pages through email or permalink), UI would be of utmost importance to us. Several of our engineers have taken usability classes (6.831 was awesome!), and we pride ourselves in the simplicity of our product.<p>4. We are looking into implementing your suggestions.

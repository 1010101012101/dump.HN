To be honest, I&#x27;m kinda tired of hearing this, because it seems to come from people who never really used Unity. I have extensively used KDE (v 2), Gnome (v 2), xfce4, Unity and now i3. I tried Unity simply because I was puzzled by the conflicting arguments. Power users complaining so much, while newbies were raving. I thought I would test drive it for a month just to see, I ended up using it for a year. Unity isn&#x27;t perfect (no graphic environment is), but it does have its highlights. Most of the essential functions are documented in the cheatsheet that appears when someone keeps the WinKey pressed.<p>In my opinion, most power users who complain never took the 2 minutes required to understand how that desktop works and presumed that all they had to do was to plug in their mouse and click away. If they&#x27;d taken the time, there would be less complaints, since Unity is rather keyboard centric. Newbies on the other hand thought &quot;let&#x27;s learn Linux&quot;, read the manual, and came out ecstatic.",1392407973

7240654,comment,7239407,7239811,7,0,aegiso,,,"Here&#x27;s the main enlightenment of becoming a node.js guy:<p>Node follows the unix way. Everything is a stream. It&#x27;s just Buffers and JS objects flying around. It&#x27;s really stupid, and sometimes it&#x27;s nasty. This isn&#x27;t helped by Javascript&#x27;s warts.<p>But there&#x27;s an enormous upside to this: following the stupid Unix way means that no matter what you need to do with your data, there&#x27;s an npm module for it. Just .pipe() your stream in and your code is done. This is amazing. And it&#x27;s possible only because of how bare-bones and loose the Buffer stream API is.<p>Strong typing has its place, but it would ruin node&#x27;s biggest selling point. It&#x27;s hard to realize this without trying it.",1392407934

And sometimes it just hurts to think about failures. So people don&#x27;t...<p>As for people who don&#x27;t want to talk about failures because it damages their &quot;personal brand...&quot; First, always be careful around people too interested in their &quot;personal brand.&quot; You&#x27;ll sometimes find quite a bit of bullshit, misdirection, and borderline lies coming out of those people&#x27;s mouths. Not always. But often enough. Second, if you&#x27;ve honestly learned from your experience, there&#x27;s no need to be shy about talking about it.

7240543,comment,7237184,7239571,3,0,msandford,,,"&quot;while minimally distorting prices&quot; SNIP!<p>I think there&#x27;s a serious misunderstanding here.  Any basic income that is high enough to be useful will also be high enough to be distortive.  Any basic income which is low enough not to distort will also be low enough not to be useful.<p>Consider a few thought experiments.  Set a basic income to $100 per month.  Time 300 million americans that&#x27;s only $3b per month or $36 billion per year.  That&#x27;s a small enough portion of the economy that it&#x27;s totally doable, but not useful.<p>Now instead let&#x27;s set it to $10k per month.  That&#x27;s definitely enough to pay a mortgage, cars, etc.  Times 300 million folks we end up at $3 trillion a month or $36 trillion a year.  GDP in 2013 was about 17 trillion so we&#x27;ve definitely distorted prices by a huge margin.  The price of everything probably triples.<p>OK, you say, let&#x27;s dial it back just a tad and calibrate it to the size of the economy.  Let&#x27;s set our target at 30% of total GDP which we would argue we can totally do since the government historically gets about 19% of GDP so growing that by 50% should be doable.  Of course this means that the federal government provides no services or does nothing except for basic income; no military, no NSF, no dept of education, none of that stuff.  Ignore it for now.  17 trillion time 0.3 = 5.1 trillion a year, or 425 billion a month.  Divide that by 300 million people and you get $1416 per month.<p>That&#x27;s not a TERRIBLE number, if you live in a rural area you could pay a mortgage, car payment and even buy some food for that.  If you lived in a big city that might cover your rent, but probably not.<p>But wait, you say, there aren&#x27;t 300 million adults in the US?  OK let&#x27;s assume it&#x27;s only 200 million.  That number goes up to $2125 per month and you don&#x27;t get a check until you turn 18.  Yeah that&#x27;s better, for sure, you might even make rent in a big city.  In a rural area you&#x27;re doing fairly nicely.<p>But how do we raise this money?  There&#x27;s a difference between income and wealth, if you took every penny from all the Forbes 400 list you&#x27;d have $2 trillion.  But actually you wouldn&#x27;t because you&#x27;re assuming that you can sell their assets for cash at exactly the price they&#x27;re valued at right now.  If you did that you might recoup 80% because it&#x27;d be a giant sell-off.  But let&#x27;s ignore that for a minute.  Let&#x27;s also say that you by the time you get down to every person whose net worth is over a million (remember, only the rich) that you&#x27;ve raised another 2 trillion (pie in the sky, the distribution of wealth isn&#x27;t anywhere near equal remember?).  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Forbes_400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Forbes_4...</a>  At that point you&#x27;ve got enough cash to make this whole thing run for about 10 months.<p>The total US income for all people in 2013 was $13 trillion.  <a href=""https://bber.unm.edu/econ/us-tpi.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bber.unm.edu/econ/us-tpi.htm</a>  Take all that money and divide it up between 200 million adults and you&#x27;ve got $65k per person per year once you turn 18.  BUT that&#x27;s it.  Janitor?  $65k.  Doctor?  $65k.  Lawyer?  $65k.  Startup founder?  $65k.  CEO?  $65k.  VC?  $65k.  Nobody, anywhere, ever could make more than $65k or else you don&#x27;t have somewhere to take the money from.  And at that point I think it might be hard to convince people to work harder, take more risks with their personal wealth, study longer, etc if NO MATTER WHAT they can&#x27;t make more than $65k.<p>If you want to allow people to make more, that&#x27;s OK.  But for every person that makes $75k under this scheme you&#x27;ve got to find someone to only give $55k and to convince them that it&#x27;s right, or dial the basic income back to $55k and start giving only select bonuses.<p>Of course, remember that all this ignores the idea that we still have to provide all those federal functions that we&#x27;re currently providing.",1392406703

This forces us to confront our essential challenge which is the development of good character.  All forms of government are attempts to manage human wickedness.  Corollary: it very nearly doesn&#x27;t matter what form of government obtains if the people in that government are <i>virtuous</i>.<p>* Permaculture (modelling agricultural systems on natural ecologies) is a non-technological mode of abundance.<p>* Communism: The Smurfs.<p>* It seems to me that the &quot;natural&quot; economic system varies with personal &quot;distance&quot;. Broadly: immediate family/friends -> communistic; (Are the Amish commies? No.) neighbors -> barter / reciprocal gift-giving; strangers -> capitalism.<p>* If there is something to that last point then as the Internet shrinks personal distance we should expect a general trend from impersonal capitalistic forms to more personal &quot;altruistic&quot; forms (Gittip, etc...)<p>* As technology advances we are forced to become unwilling to &quot;solve problems with bullets&quot;.  If you are willing (for <i>any</i> reason) to commit violence you will perforce be kept from the really potent weapons.  Already so-called &quot;psych-ops&quot; have become the cutting edge (no pun intended) of warfare: eliminate the enemy&#x27;s <i>desire</i> to fight.

It incorporates various groups of people that believe in property rights, and believe that government should be &quot;small&quot;. Non-existent government is as small as it can get, so most people consider anarcho-capitalism to be a flavor of libertarianism. I use the term &quot;anarchist libertarian&quot; to point out that I am talking about the specific 0-government flavor of libertarianism.<p>> All that is required is the non-aggression principal and voluntarism.<p>But if you define libertarianism like that, anarcho-capitalism becomes the only legitimate form of libertarianism.

Oddly, this is sometimes described as distribution &quot;throughout the universe&quot;. This is actually not an uncommon problem for artists from this era who relied heavily on samples (i.e., hip-hop).<p>Would they have cleared samples used on their albums &quot;in perpetuity&quot;, giving De La the widest distribution license available (read: for use forever), we would not be talking about De La Soul releasing music for free online. We&#x27;d be buying it on iTunes and they&#x27;d be compensated for it. End of story.<p>Instead, De La makes most of their money off CD sales and touring, which is a tough spot as CDs are entering obsolescence and touring, especially at their age, must be grueling. On the flip side, the good news here is De La Soul and early hip-hop pioneers are seeing a resurgence (IMHO well-deserved) and getting the music out there by any means necessary is a crucial step to be heard.

7240446,comment,7239237,7239237,26,0,lkrubner,,,"The USA had a similar ruling back in 1996. Many people were engaged in &quot;Deep Linking&quot;, that is, linking to a page that was not the front page of the website. The plaintiff won the case and it was briefly illegal to link to anything but the front page of the sites. This was overturned shortly after.<p>Nowadays, we refer to &quot;deep linking&quot; as &quot;linking&quot;, but it was legally contested for a long time. This was published as late as 2004:<p>&quot;&quot;Deep linking&quot; is a special kind of hyperlink: it defeats the remote website&#x27;s intended method of navigation, taking one to a page deeper than the home page [4] A deep link leads the user to an interior page of a website, rather than to the home page thereof.\n&quot;<p>Searching on Google, I see that the courts, in the USA and Europe, were ambivalent about deep linking, in the mid 90s when the Web was just emerging. For instance:<p><a href=""http://www.linksandlaw.com/linkingcases-deeplinks.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linksandlaw.com/linkingcases-deeplinks.htm</a><p>&quot;The lawsuit against an online news search engine which allowed users access to articles in the database of the plaintiffs via deep links was based on paragraph 87 b of the German copyright law (UrhG). This paragraph derives from European Union Directive 96/9/ECC of March 11, 1996. A decision, which had banned deep linking by search engines to databases could have influenced other EU member states&#x27; jurisprudence and caused significant difficulties for search engines outside the European Union as well. &quot;<p>also:<p>&quot;Shetland Times v. Shetland News<p>&quot;In 1996 the Shetland Times newspaper filed a lawsuit against the Shetland News for linking to Times&#x27; articles. Scotland&#x27;s Court of Session issued an interim interdict banning the links. Before Scotland’s highest court could rule on the legality of the links, the two publishers settled the case.&quot;<p>also:<p><a href=""http://www.ibusinesslawyer.com/cyberlinks/linking.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibusinesslawyer.com/cyberlinks/linking.htm</a><p>&quot;Ticketmaster Corp. v. Microsoft Corp., No. 97-3055 DDP (C.D. CA, complaint, filed 4/28/97)\nFirst major linking case in US. Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Sidewalk&quot; site allowed visitors to buy tickets to entertainment events via &quot;deep&quot; link to Ticketmaster site. Ticketmaster alleged trademark dilution and other unfair competition causes of action. Case settled on undisclosed terms, although Microsoft removed its deep link.&quot;<p>&quot;Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, Inc., CV99-7654 HLH (BQRx) (C.D. CA, Mar. 27, 2000) [requires acrobat reader to view]\nTickets.com deep linked to Ticketmaster&#x27;s site to provide its visitors the opportunity to buy tickets to certain events. Court dismissed contention that linking constituted copyright violation, because there was no literal copying. Court also found that absent specific evidence of assent, allegation that defendant breached site&#x27;s &quot;terms of service&quot; failed to state a claim. Literal copying claim and certain unfair competition claims not dismissed, however.&quot;<p>This is from the American Library Association:<p>&quot; &quot;Deep linking&quot; is the practice of providing links to interior pages within a Web site without directing people using the link through the host site&#x27;s main page. Some site owners see deep linking as problematic because it takes control over the viewer&#x27;s experience away from them and may create confusion over whose site is whose. For sites with commercial advertising or subscriptions, for example, deep linking may mean users get to see the content of the site without having to &quot;pay&quot; for the information by first accessing advertisements placed on a welcome page or by paying for the subscription. Other people see linking as a necessary part of Web design and argue that deep links actually provide a service by steering users to the linked sites.&quot;<p>and also this:<p>&quot;Some court decisions have been seen as very supportive of linking. In 1997, in an opinion striking down a Georgia Internet statute, a federal district judge suggested that the practice of linking is protected by the First Amendment (ACLU of Georgia v. Zell Miller). In a federal court in September 1998, a California judge dismissed a suit in which the plaintiff claimed that the defendants maintained Web sites that included links to a Swedish site containing copyright infringing material. The court ruled that the copyright infringing material was &quot;several links removed&quot; from the defendants&#x27; site (Bernstein v. JC Penney, Inc.).&quot;<p>Needless to say, Google (and Hacker News) would be illegal if deep linking had been banned.",1392405760

I think it was Plato who commented that a democracy was doomed once its citizens realised they could vote themselves largesse out of the treasury. Which is pretty much what is happening these days in every modern industrial democracy - government spending constantly increases and any suggestions of cutting spending are met by massive protests.<p>Example: in the UK media right now you will read many stories about the current government&#x27;s &quot;deep, savage cuts&quot;, and all the poor people who are suffering as a result of these cold, uncaring conservatives. But after all these cuts the UK is still running at a deficit.<p>Of course, Plato was an old fool who lived in the days before fiat money.

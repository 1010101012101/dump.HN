2513509,comment,2513233,2513467,2,0,pygy_,,,"Lua uses asymmetric coroutines, you're describing the symmetric variety.<p>From <i>Programming in Lua</i>[1] by R. Ierusalimschy<p><i>For those that already know something about coroutines, it is important to clarify some concepts before we go on. Lua offers what I call asymmetric coroutines. That means that it has a function to suspend the execution of a coroutine and a different function to resume a suspended coroutine. Some other languages offer symmetric coroutines, where there is only one function to transfer control from any coroutine to another.<p>Some people call asymmetric coroutine semi-coroutines (because they are not symmetrical, they are not really co). However, other people use the same term semi-coroutine to denote a restricted implementation of coroutines, where a coroutine can only suspend its execution when it is not inside any auxiliary function, that is, when it has no pending calls in its control stack. In other words, only the main body of such semi-coroutines can yield. A generator in Python is an example of this meaning of semi-coroutines.<p>Unlike the difference between symmetric and asymmetric coroutines, the difference between coroutines and generators (as presented in Python) is a deep one; generators are simply not powerful enough to implement several interesting constructions that we can write with true coroutines. Lua offers true, asymmetric coroutines. Those that prefer symmetric coroutines can implement them on top of the asymmetric facilities of Lua. It is an easy task. (Basically, each transfer does a yield followed by a resume.) </i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lua.org/pil/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/pil/index.html</a>, <a href=""http://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html</a>",1304509474

2513457,comment,2513367,2513367,5,0,lyudmil,,,"""Copy/paste code from answer.""<p>Copy/pasting is one of the most obvious code smells. I don't do it, you should never do it, and anyone who does should rightly be considered at best irresponsible and at worst incompetent.<p>The first reason is obvious - you need to understand every line of code you check in. I won't beat a dead horse here.<p>There is a more subtle point, however. Every programmer writes in their own style and it's important that your code has a consistent style (yours). This doesn't just include the cosmetic aspects (e.g. indentation), but also design tendencies, word choice, etc. I've never seen a piece of code someone else has written and thought ""Wow, that's <i>exactly</i> how I would've done it."" If you're willing to tolerate a completely different style in your source, then I question the degree to which you care about your craft, and consequently all of your work the way I would an author's if I found 5 pages written by someone else in their book.<p>So, please, read the code, understand why it works, figure out how you would do it, then code <i>that</i> up.",1304507713

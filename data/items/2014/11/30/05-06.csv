In this system, you compress the whole &quot;live 50 years and have slightly more / fewer children&quot; step into one procedure.<p>This one is equivalent to picking the best one of 50 naturally occurring children, and raising them alone, every generation.<p>If Michael Jordan he had 50 children with a similarly elite mother, most of them would regress to the mean - but the best one could conceivably be near his level.  If he had only one kid, it&#x27;s very likely that the kid would regress significantly.<p>Also, of course there are negatives to high IQ but most of the time, this selection method wouldn&#x27;t be done for that level.  Two people of IQ 100 would be able to reliably have children of IQ 115, and those kids would have happier, longer, healthier lives, with no increased risks.  [see the scottish IQ study; iq at age 11 was linked to a lifetime of better outcomes]<p>That is the real benefit of this technology - to give people the option of gradually bringing out the best of what&#x27;s already inside themselves.

8676108,comment,8674312,8674312,0,0,graycat,,,"Anomaly detection in large server farms and networks\n-- important problem.  OP -- nice description of the\nproblem!<p>But, there&#x27;s more!<p>(1) Zero Day Problems.<p>If we see a problem very often, maybe even just\nonce, hopefully we make changes to protect against\nthat problem so that the chances of seeing that\nproblem again fall to nearly nothing.<p>So, after we make such changes, net, the problems we\nreally want to detect are the ones we&#x27;ve never seen\nbefore.  That is, we want to detect problems when\nthey are seen for the first time, on <i>day zero</i>,\nthat is, <i>zero day</i> problems.<p>So, in this situation, we have not yet seen any of\nthe problems we are trying to detect, are trying to\ndetect problems we have never seen before, and,\nthus, do not have data on those problems.<p>And, for a problem we&#x27;ve seen before, even if we\ndon&#x27;t make changes to protect against that problem,\na good detector for just that problem is usually a\ncomparatively easy challenge and one that we should\nmeet.<p>(2) Good Data.<p>Call a system from which we are collecting data our\n<i>target</i> system.  So, if our target system is\nreasonably <i>stable</i>, then maybe we can collect data\nfrom that system for some hours, weeks, maybe\nmonths.  If we let the data <i>age</i> and still see no\nsymptoms of problems, then we regard this data, this\n<i>history</i> data, as from a <i>healthy</i> system, that is\n<i>good</i> data.<p>(3) Hypothesis Test.<p>So, continually in near real time, we collect data\nand do some calculation to raise an alarm or not.<p>This work needs to be essentially a statistical\n<i>hypothesis test</i> performed continually as we\nreceive data.<p>In such a test, we tentatively assume that the target\nsystem is healthy.  This assumption is our <i>null\nhypothesis</i>, that is, an assumption of a healthy\nsystem, nothing wrong, a <i>null</i> bad effect.<p>Then we use the assumption of this null hypothesis,\nthe <i>good</i> data, and the data we just received\n(observed) to calculate a number, we call a <i>test\nstatistic</i>, and then calculate the probability,\nusually called alpha, of getting a test statistic\nthat far from what it would have been for a healthy\nsystem.  If that probability is too low to be\nreasonable, then we reject the null hypothesis that\nthe system was healthy, conclude that the system is\nsick, and raise an alarm.<p>So, alpha is the probability of getting such a bad\nvalue for the test statistic when the system is\nhealthy.  So, for a healthy system, alpha is the\nprobability of raising a false alarm.  Alpha is also\ncommonly call Type I error.<p>Then a missed detection of a real problem is Type II\nerror, and commonly its probability is called beta.\nThat is, beta is the probability of saying that the\nsystem is healthy when it is sick.<p>The <i>detection rate</i>, the probability of saying the\nsystem is sick when it is, is one minus beta.<p>Commonly we call alpha the <i>rate</i> of false alarms and\nbeta the <i>rate</i> of missed detections.<p>(4) Detector Quality.<p>There can be many hypothesis tests.  A <i>perfect</i>\ntest is one with both alpha and beta zero; usually\non the shelf of reality, the box of the perfect\ntests is empty.<p>It&#x27;s easy to have alpha, the rate of false alarms,\nbe zero -- just turn off the detector.  But then\nbeta, the rate of missed detections, will be 1.<p>It&#x27;s easy to have beta be 0 -- just sound the alarm\nall the time.  But then alpha will be 1.<p>Generally, for a given detector that is not perfect,\nthere is a trade-off -- the lower we insist that\nalpha be, the higher beta will be.<p>But not all detectors are the same:  Some detectors\nare better than others, that is, <i>closer</i> to being a\nperfect detector, that is, with a given alpha give a\nsmaller beta, that is, a better trade-off.  And\ndetectors, even ones with the same alpha and beta,\ncan differ on what real problems they detect.<p>(5) Best Detector.<p>The question of what would be the best possible\ndetector was answered by the Neyman-Pearson result.\nSo, for a given alpha, the best possible detector\ngets the lowest possible beta.  A relatively general\nproof can be obtained from measure theory and,\nthere, the Hahn decomposition from the Radon-Nikodym\ntheorem.<p>Alas, usually in practice, the Neyman-Pearson result\nasks for more data than we can have; in particular,\nwhen looking for zero-day problems we can&#x27;t hope to\nuse Neyman-Pearson.<p>A high <i>quality</i> detector is one with a relatively\nlow beta for its alpha.  In practice a high quality\ndetector saves money from chasing false alarm and\nthe possibly serious problems of missed detections.\nOf course, the Neyman-Pearson result tells us how to\ncreate the highest quality detector possible.<p>(6) Adjusting Alpha.<p>Commonly in practice, we can select a value for\nalpha and have our detector obtain that value.  So,\nin advance we can select the value we want for alpha\nand get that value in practice.  But typically we\nhave to get the corresponding value of beta by\nempirical means.  Since when looking for zero day\nproblems in a well run server farm or network we\nstand to get relatively few detections, we can have\ntrouble getting an accurate estimate of beta.<p>(7) Data Distribution.<p>It can help use create a higher quality detector if\nwe know the probability distribution of the data we\nobserve when the system is healthy.  As in the OP,\nmaybe that distribution could be Gaussian, although\nwith much time with real data from networks and\nserver farms we expect to see Gaussian data only\nrarely.<p>If we make no assumptions about the probability\ndistribution of the data from a healthy target, then\nour statistical hypothesis test is\n<i>distribution-free</i>.  For data from real server\nfarms and networks, we are usually forced to use\ndistribution-free tests.  A special case of\n<i>distribution-free</i> is <i>non-parametric</i>.<p>(8) Dimensions.<p>It is common in practice, from one target system, to\nbe able to collect data on each of several, say, n,\nvariables at data rates from a point each few second\nup to some hundreds of points a second.<p>Typically data from one variable is not independent\nof that from the other variables.<p>So, with several variables, there is a\nmulti-dimensional, n-dimensional, region, the\n<i>critical</i> region, such that we raise an alarm if\nand only if we get data in that region.<p>For a high quality detector, that region should\naccurately fit where we want to raise an alarm --\nthe Neyman-Pearson result, when we have data enough\nto use it, can specify just what that region is.<p>If our detector is based on just <i>thresholds</i> on the\nseparate variables, then we are forced to have our\ncritical region be just some n-dimensional box, and\nsuch a box gives us relatively little ability to get\nan accurate <i>fit</i>.  With a poor fit, for our\nselected alpha, we stand to get a relatively high\nbeta and, thus, lower detector quality.<p>Or course, for our n-variables, the best detector\nthat does good work with all n variables jointly\nwill be the best detector we can have.  Or, whatever\ncan be done with the variables separately can also\nbe done, along with more, in an n-dimensional\ndetector.<p>For an intuitive explanation, suppose n = 2 and we\nget data points on a checker board.  Suppose a point\non a red square indicates a healthy target and, a\nblack square a sick one.  If we consider the n = 2\nvariables separately, then we will have a low\nquality detector, but if we consider the n = 2\nvariables together, then we can have a perfect\ndetector.<p>With n-dimensional data, usually we have to give up\non knowing the probability distribution of the data.<p>(9) Old Techniques.<p>Long the workhorse of server monitoring was\nthresholds.  Later <i>expert systems</i> tried to use\n<i>rules</i> to determine when to raise an alarm, say,<p><pre><code>     When I see A, B, and one of\n     X, Y, or Z, it looks bad;\n     raise an alarm.\n</code></pre>\nHere we had no idea of detector quality or false\nalarm rate and no ability to adjust false alarm\nrate.  Or the work was necessarily statistical\nhypothesis testing except it was being done poorly.<p>(10) Summary.<p>The OP was correct that false alarms are bad but\nmissed detections can be worse.  So, we want high\nquality detectors, and for a given detector, to get\nthe lowest rate of missed detections, that is, the\nhighest detection rate, we can, we set the false\nalarm rate at the highest value the operating staff\nis willing to tolerate.  Of course, in practice, if\nthe false alarm rate is too high, the staff may just\nignore the detector and its alarms thus giving a\nzero detection rate.<p>So, what we want is a collection of statistical\nhypothesis tests that are both n-dimensional and\ndistribution-free where we can select and know the\nfalse alarm rates and otherwise have good evidence\nof high quality detectors.<p>All of this discussion is now quite old material.\nMy conclusion for some years has been that people\nwith large server farms and networks doing important\nwork really should be interested but that nearly no\none is.<p>Apparently the OP has re-discovered this subject.\nHere I&#x27;ve tried to get everyone caught up as of some\nyears ago!",1417326553

While elliptic curves in cryptography are usually attributed to Hendrik Lenstra for destructive purposes (ECM factorization), and Koblitz and Miller for constructive purposes in 1985, this paper contains almost everything relevant to <i>practical</i> curve-based cryptography long before everyone else. Highlights include:<p>- Hessian, Jacobian quartic, and Jacobian intersection curves, and derivation of respective fast addition and doubling formulas; they also comment on the value of unified addition formulas for simplicity.<p>- The &quot;Montgomery&quot; ladder for &quot;x-only&quot; Jacobian intersections: Peter Montgomery was directly influenced by this paper to produce his curves, and it is easy to see the resemblance.<p>- The idea of working in genus 2, and formulas for genus 2 Kummer surface doubling. Hyperelliptic curve cryptography was only later proposed by Koblitz in 1987. Almost 3 decades later, Kummer surfaces are now the fastest way to do scalar multiplication on beefy hardware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0196885886900230"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/01968858869...</a>",1417325553

If they&#x27;re that similar that you can easily notice that kind of inconsistency, then those numbers ought to be in some kind of data structure - an array, or they should all be objects or something holding the name and the age. Exactly how to set that up varies by the language and the problem domain, but I can&#x27;t think of any language where there isn&#x27;t a better way to do it than that<p>Meanwhile, things that actually should be separate integer definitions like that don&#x27;t have any direct connection to each other, and so you can&#x27;t trivially tell that something is wrong by looking at a column of numbers.",1417324949

One thing that seems odd to me is that the author credits Motorola with naming of the eieio instruction. I would have thought that instruction would have been in the original Power instruction set and thus it would have been IBM that named it. Anyone know?",1243583995

631722,comment,630427,631273,0,0,dkarl,,,"I have real-time conversations via email, too.  The difference is in the expectations of the participants.  It's subtle and social.  I wouldn't just walk away from a fast-running IM conversation to go to lunch without saying something to let the other person know I was going to be gone for a while.  That would be rude.  Doubly so on the phone.  You don't just hang up on somebody in the middle of a conversation unless you're pissed at them.  Email is different.  Nobody thinks it's weird or rude if you disappear from an email conversation for ten minutes.  After sending an email, you can even walk away from your computer and not check your email again for hours, unless the content of your message indicated otherwise.<p>In contrast, an IM that isn't a one-off message says, ""If you're there and available, I would like to have a real-time chat with you.""  Each mode of communication sets different expectations.  It's quite handy.  If you unify everything into a single mode of communication, then you have to set expectations explicitly.<p>""Hi, Joe.  Can you tell me XYZ?  Please reply when you are available to have an interactive real-time conversation with me.""<p>""Hi, Joe.  Can you tell me XYZ?  Please reply at your leisure.  I may not be available immediately to discuss your reply but will respond at some point if I have further questions.""<p>See the difference?  Of course, the different modes of communication don't mean the same things to everybody.  I expect every company and every group of friends has a slightly different IM culture, for instance.",1243583906

631675,comment,631568,631568,0,0,gruseom,,,"I haven't experienced what you describe, but have had different involuntary auditory experiences for years. The key for me has been to learn not to be bothered by them. Everyone has involuntary thought processes; I don't see why some shouldn't be connected to the auditory parts of the brain.<p>It helped me to see that what was bothering me was not whatever I was ""hearing"" but entirely a secondary process - thoughts <i>about</i> what I was hearing, like worrying or frustration. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's a critical point and I recommend it.<p>Equally helpful (and intimately related) has been to develop simple somatic awareness. A good way to grasp this is to pay attention to the space between thoughts. That is silent, so it is a mode you can shift to when you don't want to deal with mental chatter. Having that option provides relief. It is also grounded in the body in a way that most thoughts are not (I'm speaking purely experientially). Developing that awareness over time gives you greater inner depth, which turns out to be invaluable in a lot of ways.<p>If the auditory stuff never settles down, maybe the space ""between"" thoughts is inaccessible; in that case I switch to the silence behind them. Inner silence is never far away, but you need to find your own way of connecting with it.<p>As I said, I don't know if this will make sense. These things are hard to articulate. I will say that sometimes they are challenges that pay off if you learn what you need to learn.<p>As for whether you're going nuts, who cares? You can be a balanced, well-grounded nutcase. This is an example of a secondary idea that pretends to be about the underlying experience but actually isn't; it's a meta-worry.",1243580544

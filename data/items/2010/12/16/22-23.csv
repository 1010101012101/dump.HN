No where else has that crappy of living conditions per dollar spent where there is a good engineering school.<p>Low out of state tuition: My alma mater (Georgia Tech) gets tons and tons of out of state students due to the low cost yet good results. Many of those students then STAY there in Atlanta.<p>Tons of well paying internships/co-op jobs: NYC is addicted to free/low priced interns. I'd say many NYC companies are giant dicks about this policy as well. Make it illegal and harshly punished to offer those in the engineering professions, or setup a huge list of partners pledging to never ever accept unpaid work. In every other part of the country with good engineering schools, you get paid between $12-30 bucks an hour while co-op working (basically an internship you go back to every other semester). This <i>has</i> to happen to keep people in NYC when they get out. Co-op jobs are a great way to basically keep engineers there in town as they almost always get an offer at that position after graduation.<p>Get nerdy sheik cultural events going on in the city: NYC is too overly status conscious in many ways to appeal to geeky folk. And while not all engineers are geeks, many people assume they are. They act like they're some sort of neckbearded smelly dude in the back of class who's good for nothing other than fixing your computer.

2014197,comment,2014004,2014004,0,0,tptacek,,,"In 2001, Angelos Keromytis --- then a grad student at Penn, now a Columbia professor --- added support for hardware-accelerated IPSEC NICs. When you have an IPSEC NIC, the channel between the NIC and the IPSEC stack keeps state to tell the stack not to bother doing the things the NIC already did, among them validating the IPSEC ESP authenticator. Angelos' code had a bug; it appears to have done the software check <i>only</i> when the hardware had already done it, and skipped it otherwise.<p>The bug happened during a change that simultaneously refactored and added a feature to OpenBSD's ESP code; a comparison that should have been == was instead !=; the ""if"" statement with the bug was originally and correctly !=, but should have been flipped based on how the code was refactored.<p>HD Moore may as we speak be going through the pain of reconstituting a nearly decade-old version of OpenBSD to verify the bug, but stipulate that it was there, and here's what you get: IPSEC ESP packet authentication was disabled if you didn't have hardware IPSEC. There is probably an elaborate man-in-the-middle scenario in which this could get you traffic inspection, but it's nowhere nearly as straightforward as leaking key bits.<p>To entertain the conspiracy theory, you're still suggesting that the FBI not only introduced this bug, but also developed the technology required to MITM ESP sessions, bouncing them through some secret FBI-developed middlebox.<p>One year later, Jason Wright from NETSEC (the company at the heart of the [I think silly] allegations about OpenBSD IPSEC backdoors) fixed the bug.<p>It's interesting that the bug was fixed without an advisory (oh to be a fly on the wall on ICB that day; Theo had a, um, a, ""way"" with his dev team). On the other hand, we don't know what releases of OpenBSD actually had the bug right now.<p>It seems vanishingly unlikely that there could have been anything deliberate about this series of changes. You are unlikely to find anyone who will impugn Angelos. Meanwhile, the diffs tell exactly the opposite of the story that Greg Perry told.",1292539866

Fade-in effects and movements of objects and much more are possible. Unfortunately Inline-SVG does not work in Internet Explorer: the pages will have to be delivered with an application/xhtml+xml MIME type to browsers that can understand it (Opera, Firefox, Chrome, Safari). Internet Explorer will just show a download prompt for such a page. And the XHTML pages must be valid, otherwise the compliant browsers display an error page instead of the (buggy) web page. This is a huge difference to normal HTML pages.<p>With SVG it is possible to construct vector graphic animations without JavaScript for browsers that support SVG animations.

They have proven they have the muscle to make the world take notice, and at least superficially, that they can decide to do something useful with that attention.  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/pro-wikileaks-digital-activists-change-course/67847/ (No small task if it was truly a collective decision.)<p>Regardless of how you feel about Anonymous, you've got to respect that they've pushed the world to realize a lesson - that an online leaderless collective with low latency can have instant access to the media's ear.<p>In a way, this lesson is the same as it ever was - another picket line.  But it also seems things are on a new scale.  I've been feeling that it is important for the hacker community to help the world understand this type of instant collaborative political voice that is both exciting and unnerving - how it can troll and manipulate but how it can also be earnest.  And most importantly, how it is startlingly powerful.<p>After that overblown introduction - I propose a dubious experiment.  If you think this experiment sucks, then start a new one, but my question is this: how hard is it for a leaderless collective to form an agreed upon collaborative statement that is eloquent, powerful, and useful.  Is this just reiterating Wikipedia, or does it demonstrate something new?<p>Can we demonstrate that an online collective can literally author a collaborative statement fit for media attention?<p>http://piratepad.net/LW793ZNN6Z\n(any motion to take this to git?)",1292537274

If someone else had already posted a link, great:  People just joined in the conversation there if they had something to say.  From my perspective, it saved the time of having to post it.  And, in that I was often learning as much or more from the conversation on HN than from the links themselves, I was happy to find that conversation focused in one thread.<p>I'm not sure how, but I'd like to see the site steered back in that direction, if possible.  (I have a few half-baked ""ideas"", but PG and crew have already demonstrated themselves to be more insightful than me -- in my own mind.)<p>I do think identifying the HN member behind DupDetector might be a benefit, to demonstrate their investment in the community and therefore, in my mind at least, credibility.  Yes, I see the email address now, and I half remember off the top of my head whose domain that is.  But I might have been a bit more supportive if I knew who was behind it and that they had an established, positive history with HN.<p>Anyway, just my 2¢; spend them before you need a wheelbarrow full.",1292536817

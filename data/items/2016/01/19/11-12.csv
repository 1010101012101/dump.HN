Carry out spot checks to verify the sources and the accuracy of suppliers’ assurances. Require these measures in all circumstances, including in cases where minerals originate from areas which may be remote or difficult to access.<p>>Commission and publish regular independent third-party audits of their supply chain.<p>>Federations and associations of comptoirs and other trade bodies: adopt an explicit policy not to buy or handle minerals which benefit any of the warring parties in eastern DRC.

It has been supported by cPanel since the beginning of 2014, and presumable the competing shared host control panels too, so if your host is up-to-date then SNI should be available (if your host is running a 2014-or-before build of the control panel, move host now as they are likely vulnerable to a variety of security issues).<p>Unfortunately &quot;up-to-date client applications&quot; has been the sticking point: no version of Internet Explorer running on XP supports SNI, nor do older mobile browsers. Your site would still work on those older browsers but the user would get a security warning on each visit which is not desirable. Browsers that old are getting less common, and are getting locked out already because of protocol/cypher changes intended to mitigate recently discovered attacks against SSL/TLS, so SNI is an increasingly practical option (how practical is your decision: can you afford to potentially scare off that remaining small percentage of potential users? Personally I say &quot;definitely yes, people that out-of-date are a nightmare to support anyway so my competitors can have them&quot;).<p>Of course IPv6 also fixes the issue too, but adoption of that lags behind the adoption of SNI compatible browsers by a long way.",1453203041

Current US foreign policy is to blow those people to bits, not buy oil from them to preserve their &quot;jobs&quot;.<p>You seem to be under the assumption that buying minerals from the Congo means the miners actually got paid.

4528711,comment,4528083,4528175,2,0,ig1,,,"Academics are completely free to submit their papers to open access journals, the reason they don't do so is because they want the brand value from publishing in prestigious closed-access journals and because submitting to those journals is free.<p>Building that brand value has risks and cost money to produce (due to editorial, etc costs) hence the publishers need to recoup that value. Open-access journals to recoup that cost either charge the authors or rely upon a subsidies from wealthy benefactors (universities, industrial sponsors).",1347785870

I know you to be a reliable person, no reason to think you'd suddenly get fickle and take something I said seriously.<p>Do you mean to tell me that if somebody rolled up with a check written out for your price you wouldn't light the servers on fire and run for the hills? Realistically the only people who are cared after in any acquisition are the investors so that no bad-blood is in the water for the next acqui-hire. Customers are always left in the dark.<p>If you want any credibility to the contrary, you'd better start presenting your customers with an SLA that guarantees a detailed transition with a timeline in the case of company failure/acquisition.<p>Or you can just play PR games.

4528709,comment,4527632,4527707,2,0,lloeki,,,"> The burn-in is the one issue where Apple dropped the ball, but it's obviously not big enough to get the attention of major media<p>It sounds awfully like the yellow tinge issue for the iMac screens.<p>I ordered a 21"" on the online Apple Store, and it had the tinge. Called Apple, they sent me another and picked up the previous one. It was worse. The third one was better but still affected. The fourth one was on par with the first. All of that cost me zero money, and every Apple rep was friendly. At that point I had gathered enough info from various forums to know that about 50% of the 21"" screens were affected, whereas the odds were much, much lower (maybe 15%) for the 27"", and there was some dry-up effect that would make it disappear (whereas the 21"" only got worse). Yet it was out of my budget (the 21"" was a bargain at the time, one of the rare times where it was not 1$:1). I called for what I thought was a final order cancellation (I was ready to buy a demo unit that I knew was not affected because I saw it in an Apple Store), and even before I mentioned anything except that the last unit was still affected, the rep called his manager to cancel the order and offer me a rebate which spanned the price difference between the 21"" and the 27"". That one had the tinge vanish in a few hours of use and is working fantastic to this day.",1347785748

A city built straight on top of radioactive rock, 200-500 times normal background radiation levels (like a constant dental scan, a little more than you'd get swimming in the primary coolant circuit of a nuclear reactor, 3 meters from an active fission reaction, without any separation between you and the reaction other than the water that sustains the reaction), yet you will not find a single trace of a nuclear power plant.

Is that really what grandparent did? I think it's an unfair characterization. It was a personal opinion stated weakly and with restraint, not some attempt to incite a mob.<p>I have no opinion on this specific startup. Perhaps they've provided enough time to migrate; that's for their paying customers to judge. But it's naive to think failures doesn't affect your reputation. It does, and it should. Do you really think savvy users won't take your track record into account when deciding whether to use your service? It goes against their interests, and nothing is more darwinian than a startup.<p>---<p>Here in silicon valley we say that failure is ok. And yet accountability is also good. There's a tension here.<p>Perhaps failed startups are fine for investors, who might have diversified into many different vehicles. They're more problematic for <i>customers</i> who rely on a product. And paradoxically, the closer a startup gets to solving a hair-on-fire problem, the more careful they need to be about how they treat their customers on the way out.<p>Even if investors claim failure is ok, is that always the case? I suspect past track record <i>does</i> play a role somehow, even if it's subtle and hidden behind the scenes.<p>Even if failure is sometimes ok, there are failures and there are failures. A lot depends on how the wrap-up was carried out, and how people feel about it.<p>When startups are few and creation is to be encouraged, failure can be ignored. When startups are plentiful and failure starts to be taken for granted, perhaps it's time to emphasize accountability.",1347783183

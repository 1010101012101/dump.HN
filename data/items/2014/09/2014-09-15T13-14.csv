The problem with Gamma Group, and what I suspect is one of the core reasons for this leak, is that they happily sell their product to extremely oppressive regimes and give them personal support, knowing full well that the tools are being used to spy on and find dissidents, protesters, and political opponents.",1410789587

I tried the game a few times and it&#x27;s not really for me but everything around Notch&#x27;s story is interesting (I bet their going to make a movie about this at some point). Not everyone can be an entrepreneur and I feel that in this case (on a different scale of course), we basically watched a plausible version of how Apple could have gotten started if there was only a Wozniak but no Jobs.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many here that dream of having their idea be a huge success but aren&#x27;t really interested in becoming the next Bill Gates or Zuckerberg. They just want to cash out so that they can have their financial freedom and then go out of the limelight and back to doing the same things they enjoy but without having to constantly worry about job security and putting food on the table. Notch achieved this in the most spectacular way possible and I think he handled it perfectly.",1410789582

8318891,comment,8318506,8318593,1,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Instagram was obviously a strategic asset, where Mojang sits in terms of strategy I really don&#x27;t know exactly. Microsoft and games has always been there, but there&#x27;s also been recent talk of divesting the games branch. I think one thing is clear which is that Mojang doesn&#x27;t seem to be a games house that has a reputation of producing consistently successful titles, rather it seems like one indie project blew up and a team was built around that to support and iterate on one single concept. So it really seems clear that they&#x27;re buying minecraft which is a game that is exceptionally lucrative financially. In the past 24 hours it sold $0.3m which gives an annual run rate of $100m+ for just the game. But perhaps more importantly, it gets huge traction with people of all ages, including kids, and both genders. It&#x27;s really a cross-over product that sits extremely well with parents. The Raspberry Pi for example is indicative of this, they&#x27;re only half serious now when they say one of the key requirements is that it has to be able to run minecraft, when this thing is used by kids worldwide in and outside of classrooms. Being able to integrate that with the Microsoft brand is a big deal as you can have an entire generation grow up with positive connotations towards Microsoft, as well as a generation of parents, who know that if their kids will use computers and play games anyway, it&#x27;d be great if they&#x27;d spend it on minecraft. So I guess it&#x27;s both highly profitable (though 2.5b is quite steep at 100m annual revenue) but also has strategic value in terms of branding, although I don&#x27;t yet see how exactly they want to integrate it into their existing games branch.",1410789554

Being able to order someone to generate numbers doesn&#x27;t mean the recipients are permitted or capable of doing anything at all.  It shows they &quot;care&quot; but a random number generator is more effective WRT dev time than trying to generate meaningful numbers.<p>I&#x27;ve seen dashboards get tied up in internal politics.  The list of recipients of &quot;quality&quot; dashboard is a line in the sand vs the &quot;quantity&quot; dashboard political group.  The recipient list and who controls it is far more important than the data contained in the report.  Whats important is who reports to who, and why.<p>A fifth question is does anyone in the chain of command even remotely understand basic statistics like error bars and standard deviations?  If the only purpose of the report is to loudly trumpet when pet division B beats divisions A and C thru G, then a very high std deviation / error rate makes stack ranking give the predetermined &quot;correct&quot; result more often.  I&#x27;ve seen this personally in &quot;metrics as a teambuilding exercise&quot; where whats actually produced is a weekly report that every division will get to stack ranking win at least once a quarter to meet the Morale Improvement goal on some exec&#x27;s goal list.  Again a PRNG gives better data than real data, if the goal is to give everyone a participation trophy.",1410789553

8318800,comment,8315996,8316729,8,0,jerf,,,"There&#x27;s no generalized solution to every generic problem. The &quot;cast to interface{}&quot; is the closest to a linear mapping of generics, but if you&#x27;re reaching for that all the time, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. So the only sane answer is, &quot;it depends&quot;.<p>The only use case that I have encountered that is essentially impossible in Go is the &quot;generic data structure&quot;. Mind you, that&#x27;s a bit of a big deal, even if it covered over by &quot;generic&quot; arrays and maps (which, further, <i>does</i> cover over a lot of the cases), but it is also the only case where it is actually a problem. Despite the fact Go is not functional, like, <i>at all</i>, I still find myself using my functional training in minimizing the surface area of an &quot;object&quot; as much as possible incredibly useful when programming in Go. I think if I were only an OO programmer trying to come over to Go I&#x27;d have a much harder time of it.<p>Most of the rest of the time you can solve your problem by asking what the code is <i>really</i> trying to do, pull that up into an interface, and carry on. A substantial portion of the rest of the use case can be covered by providing wrapper objects that compose in another object, probably using an interface as the composition point.<p>I think in practice, about 80% of the problems that people trying to jam generics into Go are encountering are because they are trying to program C++, Java, or C# in Go. Despite their substantial superficial similarities, Go is not any of them, and idiomatic answers differ substantially. Let me rhetorically underline that... Go <i>really</i> looks like a Java or C# clone if you just read down the bullet points, but there are enough important differences that it&#x27;s a substantially different experience to program in it. Trying to program Go as C# is only slightly less frustrating than trying to port FP idioms into Go (which is a complete waste of time). The remaining 20% are real problems that Go hasn&#x27;t got a good answer for beyond duplicating code.<p>Now. All that said, despite the fact that people not used to idiomatic Go are significantly overstating the problem that is the lack of generics, it <i>is</i> a problem and were I in charge, I&#x27;d be trying to work something out on this front. (I actually have a proposal I&#x27;ve probably put about 4 or 5 hours of thought into. In defense of the Go developers, this <i>is</i> a nontrivial problem when you stop just waving the word &quot;generic&quot; around and start trying to seriously create an implementable suggestion, accounting for all the use cases, grammar interactions, semantics, etc.) My best argument is that for a language as mature as Go, this is embarrassing: <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/container/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/container/</a> Those are the &quot;generic&quot; containers in the standard library that ship with the language.... all three of them as of this writing, plus array and map. At this point that ought to be significantly richer.<p>(So, that ought to just about piss everybody off...)<p>Oh, I ought to add for context that I&#x27;m actually pretty fluent in Haskell, and my primary work programming language up to this point have been dynamic languages (Perl, Python, etc). So it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m not comfortable with generics or incapable of understanding how to use them or anything. If anything, I dare say my openness to other answers and then finding ways to express them in Go may be part of why this doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. There <i>are</i> other options, most of the time, and they are not generally &quot;compromises&quot;, either... they are often perfectly sensible options, or even <i>better</i> options than are available in other languages on a bang/buck basis, such as the trade for making composition very easy and inheritance something fairly difficult.",1410788779

I make games because it’s fun, and because I love games and I love to program, but I don’t make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don’t try to change the world. Minecraft certainly became a huge hit, and people are telling me it’s changed games. I never meant for it to do either. It’s certainly flattering, and to gradually get thrust into some kind of public spotlight is interesting.<p>A relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. Jens was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things. At first, I failed by trying to make something big again, but since I decided to just stick to small prototypes and interesting challenges, I’ve had so much fun with work. I wasn’t exactly sure how I fit into Mojang where people did actual work, but since people said I was important for the culture, I stayed.<p>I was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration. Later on, I watched the This is Phil Fish video on YouTube and started to realize I didn’t have the connection to my fans I thought I had. I’ve become a symbol. I don’t want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don’t understand, that I don’t want to work on, that keeps coming back to me. I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.<p>As soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I’ll probably abandon it immediately.<p>Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them.<p>I’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that. I’m also aware a lot of you were using me as a symbol of some perceived struggle. I’m not. I’m a person, and I’m right there struggling with you.<p>I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big. In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change.<p>It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.",1410788543

(Whether it be performance or implementation complexity.)</i><p>I am.<p>Performance: if you replace all generics with interface{}, you get performance that is at better or equal to current Go code.<p>Implementation complexity: You could add some constraints to generics, for example only interface types can be used as generic parameters, and all uses of variables/methods/functions with generic types need to have generic parameters given. In that case, there&#x27;s no complexity for code that doesn&#x27;t use generics. Also, generics could actually be implemented as a preprocessor that would simply insert appropriate casts from/to interface{} at calls to generic methods. Since all variables/functions in Go are declared and have known types, you could of course go further and eliminate most generic parameter annotations.",1410788089

How do they work?<p>Jobs: Computers are actually pretty simple. We’re sitting here on a bench in this café [for this part of the Interview]. Let’s assume that you understood only the most rudimentary of directions and you asked how to find the rest room. I would have to describe it to you in very specific and precise instructions. I might say, “Scoot sideways two meters off the bench. Stand erect. Lift left foot. Bend left knee until it is horizontal. Extend left foot and shift weight 300 centimeters forward…” and on and on. If you could interpret all those instructions 100 times faster than any other person in this café, you would appear to be a magician: You could run over and grab a milk shake and bring it back and set it on the table and snap your fingers, and I’d think you made the milk shake appear, because it was so fast relative to my perception. That’s exactly what a computer does. It takes these very, very simple-minded instructions—“Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it’s greater than this other number”—but executes them at a rate of, let’s say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic.<p>That’s a simple explanation, and the point is that people really don’t have to understand how computers work. Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car. You don’t have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car. You don’t have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh—but you asked. [laughs]&quot;",1410787676

This is a long shot, but it may explain it:<p>If Microsoft is trying to build its own Steam competitor (which given Valve&#x27;s current strategy to make Linux an alternative gaming platform to Windows, makes sense), then Minecraft is the perfect acquisition to start it up, for a number of reasons. It is the best selling video game of all time, with over 15 million copies sold for the PC (54 million copies across all platforms), and it has over 100 million accounts registered. It is possibly the only successful indie game that has never integrated with Steam, and that has a very young userbase (based on my experience) which, given their ages, probably isn&#x27;t part of Steam&#x27;s userbase.

In that case, implementing generics would only require a change of the type-checker of the language, or in the case of Go, not even that, which brings me to the second point:<p>2) Generics are already implemented in Go (the compiler/the language/the libraries), via map/arrays/slices, it&#x27;s just not accessible to user code.

My code tends to be very imperative and I add the channel layer at the main application level rather than the library level.<p>So from his example:<p>> func merge[T](cs ...<-chan T) <-chan T<p>You can create a function:<p><pre><code>   func merge(cs ...interface{}) interface{}\n</code></pre>\nThen call it:<p><pre><code>   merged := merge(c1, c2, c3).(<-chan int)\n</code></pre>\nYou lose type safety and pay some penalty for performance. Also merge is harder to write than it would be with generics.<p>But even languages with generics often have similar issues. For example you can&#x27;t write a generic min/max in C# either.",1410786185

3372109,comment,3371834,3371834,8,0,Corrado,,,"I've really noticed quite a bit of speed improvement lately with Ruby 1.9.3 and now Rails 3.2.0-rc1, at least in my development environment.  It's a good thing too because lately I have been thinking back fondly of the good old Rails 2.x days when you could restart the development environment without flinching.  With the latest incarnation of these two tools I love the Rake command again.  :)<p>Now, if we could just get someone to commit the fix for the debugger under Ruby 1.9.3.  Not being able to debug, or at least having to work too hard at it, is really a drag on my productivity and is keeping me from moving to the newer faster stuff everywhere.

3372105,comment,3371957,3371957,2,0,malandrew,,,"I agree with modeless in that duplication of effort is a non-problem. AFAIK The Node community is taking a different more scalable approach to community management that is painful short-term (especially for those looking for a Rails, Drupal, Django experience) and more valuable and scalable long-term.<p>Curation creates bottlenecks, single points of failure and is very subjective.<p>The fact that members of the community are thinking about objective ways to measure modules is better for the community long-term. Quality of the code in packages is important because it suggests that the module will be more maintainable and extensible long-term. But that is just one factor.<p>I hope the community leverages weighted social proof as a way to suggest which modules are fittest and should survive and prosper. Those developers who are most active in the community and contribute the most are also people that ship code and rely on the code of others in the community. One of the best way to determine which modules to use would be by weighted popularity where the usage of a module by someone of importance in the community carries more weight than usage by a non-contributer.<p>Basically, the idea of number of ""watches"" and ""forks"" in github needs to be taken to its logical conclusion because not all watches and forks are created equal.<p>I would imagine that these are the kinds of issues the node community is considering as they try to come up with a scalable, objective way to manage what succeeds.<p>Personally I think this is a much better solution than the approach in other communities where certain library/technologies are foisted upon you under the auspices of convention over configuration. Some communities no longer just defining conventions that are widely adopted, but are picking winners and losers among newer technologies instead of allowing time for the community decide.<p>The community and open source projects around Node.js are growing too fast to subject it to curation and expect the truly great projects to emerge naturally.<p>As an endnote, the Drupal community and node.js community are fundamentally different in their approach. Drupal is an entire platform and framework, where many of the decisions of which module to use are make for you and you accept them or have to hack away to change that decision. This works in the Drupal community because by and large the problem space, content management, Drupal addresses is much smaller than that of Node.js, any problem that is better solution with asynchronous non-blocking I/O.",1324349660

We spent a further 5 months working full-time and bootstrapping it.

Shortly after, we hired a good friend of mine as our first employee. So, 5 months ""on the side"", 5 months ""full-time"" (10 months bootstrapped), and then funded after that (but with good traction & revenue, we have found our scalable business model).

To paraphrase myself from a similar thread last month:<p>Most esoteric programming languages are non-threatening. As a hypothetical programmer working on web applications, I can feel safe and comfortable in my ignorance of Haskell, Erlang, D, Io, Arc, and so on. They're far enough outside of the realm of possibility of adoption for my company that I can shrug them off with an ""oh, that sounds interesting"", and little more. Wanting to adopt one of them would require a whole new development and deployment stack, a new or ported codebase, and new integration costs with the rest of our system. You wouldn't expect to see an article talking about how people using Erlang are creating a ""knowledge gap"" for Java programmers.<p>CoffeeScript feels threatening precisely because it <i>is</i> so close to JavaScript, because the code can run with identical performance as hand-optimized JS anywhere that JavaScript can run, because any CoffeeScript library can interoperate seamlessly with any JavaScript library, and vice versa. It forces you, as a reasonable JavaScript programmer, to answer the harder question: Why should you be limited to a language that hasn't changed (IE6/IE7) since 2001?",1324347327

3371986,comment,3371334,3371334,2,0,tophercyll,,,"Sure.<p>I aim to have our interview cycle take under a week, although in honesty, I think it takes about 10 days. I often take on a little more work myself (especially in the phone screen) if I believe it helps speed up the process and saves others time. Speed is important. Keeping momentum during hiring really makes the experience better for everyone.<p>For background, I work for a startup lab in Boston (we build prototypes that we spin out into companies). We're about 35 employees.<p>Oh, and let me start by saying that while all the pre-interview work you've listed above does take some time, the real time cost to hiring is from the interview process itself since it involves multiple people.<p>1.) Resume review: 3 minutes. It took longer when I first got started. I used to agonize over ""call/dont-call."" But you'll usually have a gut reaction to the resume, and you'll eventually learn to trust that (for better or worse ;-)<p>2.) Code samples/Exercises: I don't bother with them, although another manager I work with uses them to good effect. Unfortunately, they can add between several days to a week to the process, so I do a more involved phone screen instead to keep things moving.<p>3.) Phone screen: I spend up to 90 minutes in the phone screen. This seems to be fairly unusual. 90 minutes is a lot of time to invest, but the key is, I only spend that long with the candidates I think I'd like to bring in. The call is setup so that I can cut it short at any point. Even still, I spend a lot of time here. I get to know the candidate, feel out their passions, and actually have them write code, live in an EtherPad derivative while talking to them.<p>4.) Almost 6 person-hours. Our amazing director of talent greets the candidate, and spends 15 minutes giving them the lay of the land, paperwork, etc. Then two different two-person teams interview the candidate for an hour each getting to know the candidate, sharing what life here is like, and working on one large technical problem. Then our CTO and I spend 45 minutes with the candidate answer questions, talking about the direction and strategy of the company, and gauging their interest in what we do here. Interestingly, the interview process we've been using on the UX side of things spends more time working on a single practical exercise (using computers, not whiteboards) and finishes with a broader meet-and-greet. Since I'm constantly experimenting with this process, I'm planning on trying a variant of this on the software engineer interviews as well.<p>But I aim to have the whole process from resume review to offer letter done in a week.",1324346751

Our second major political party here in Poland are fans of Fidesz agenda, who said that wants Warsaw to be like Budapest. Well, luckily for the moment our nation spoke (during recent elections) that we certainly don't.\nBeing an eastern block country citizen who happens not to be a right wing lunatic, one will probably understand that even post-communist nations need a strong left wing, even if only just to remain sane. This 'payback' stuff is mainly a far-right-wing agenda all around the region, european politics are not a cold war movie and the world is not black and white.",1324346595

3371980,comment,3370428,3371141,2,0,tikhonj,,,"Both the classes and type system are not inherently obvious: there are plenty of valid arguments for both prototype-based OO and dynamically typed languages. I personally like prototypes more than classes and am ambivalent about static/dynamic typing.<p>JavaScript <i>does</i> have packages and modules--check out CommonJS, for example. There are some issues with them in the browser, but that's a different story.<p>Generics and interfaces make no sense in a dynamically typed language. Abstract classes don't really make that much sense with a dynamic type system either, and they make <i>no</i> sense with prototype-based inheritance. Mix-ins don't make really fit into a prototype-based language either.<p>Properties would be nice. I don't know about tooling--js2 mode on Emacs is infinitely better than any IDE I've ever used (and I've use a bunch). I've never had issues managing JavaScript code--less issues than Java, for example--but I've never worked on anything particularly big.<p>JavaScript performance is now quite good. Besides, performance is not a function of the language but a function of the implementation. You wouldn't think of Scheme as a particularly fast language, but I remember recently reading about Stalin Scheme which made it as fast or faster than C.<p>Really, most of your arguments seem to stem from not liking prototypes and dynamic typing--these are just preferences. Complaints about JavaScript's lacking interfaces are like complaining your Tesla doesn't have a gearbox.<p>Your argument really makes it seem you would like nothing more than Java/C# in the browser; I personally would like little less than that. This is probably at least partly due to the name: <i>Java</i>Script makes it seem like the language is  akin to Java when it really only shares a superficial resemblance.",1324346557

I kind of share the feeling that ""our word"", in this case ""code"", is being abused and overly simplified, but overall I don't really care. People are taking the mental effort to design something in their heads and then realize it by directing the tools available to them (with some guidance of course); the more of that the better. The main danger is in leading people to believe that what they did is it.<p>Sure it's like calling the making of a tune with one of those ""press this object/key to make this sound, that object/key to make that sound"" apps ( <a href=""http://distoorted.livejournal.com/10914.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distoorted.livejournal.com/10914.html</a> is the most recent one I saw ) ""composing"", but I can't even work those apps let alone design a pleasing fugue or canon.

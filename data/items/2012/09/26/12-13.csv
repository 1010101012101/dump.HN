Sure HTTP access is fine, but RTP, RTSP, FTP, HTTPS, multicast UDP are weirder beasts...<p>To add it to the pain, VLC is a mostly C99 project, but C99 is too new a standard for Microsoft to implement it :)",1348664359

Increased efficiency might counteract demographics. Hundred years ago a lot more farmers where needed to feed the same amount of people than today. If your phone can do your medical checkup, lots of medical aid workers can perhaps be freed to do other stuff.<p>I worry that we are being brainwashed on a constant basis by a rich elite to believe the ""we have to work harder and longer"" dogma. It doesn't make that much sense, given that we are a lot more technologically advanced than 50 years ago. Granted, the population has grown, too. All I want to say that I wouldn't take your claim at face value.<p>As for working children: sure, children can work. Does that mean they are adults? I think in our times it basically means being allowed to vote and make responsible decisions. You can still work in a coal mine following orders without being able to make responsible decisions.<p>Obviously people will do what they need to survive, but while we can, we should probably try to attain to a higher standard.<p>Even for the child laborers in India it is not a given that things have to be what they are. Yes, the current system makes it so - doesn't imply that there couldn't be another system. Paying their parents more might be a start.",1348664299

WinRT requires a lot of rewrites of your code. (and the rationale behind some limitation are often political), and Microsoft is not helping or making it easy for you Notably for networking and multimedia.<p>Networking: everyone uses the BSD sockets, Win32, Linux, OSX, iOS, Android, Symbian, Bada, etc... And you cannot use them on WinRT. There is a very high chance that your code or one of your library uses it, of course. \nBut the bad part is that Microsoft does not make easy with a wrapper exposing WinSock-like API based on their new API. Not even a wrapper than does 80% of the needs.<p>Multimedia and Games: your videogame that works with a C++ engine and OpenGL ES for casual games that works on iOS, Android, Bada,... does not work under WinRT, because OpenGL is not allowed... And I don't even speak about Video acceleration.<p>Yes, they need to do a massive change in their APIs, but helping the transition would have been a good idea...<p>So yes, writing yet another Twitter client is easy on WinRT, for more complex applications, well, it is way too hard and difficult to do it this fast.",1348663621

As much as I love Microsoft, I still feel the whole Metro paradigm is a slight mistake. They are closing the doors to the tried-and-true interface that Windows users have grown to love by trying to wall people into Metro. Frankly, ""Desktop"" is almost unusuable without a Start Menu button. You can't get into Computer Properties easily (usually right-click Computer on Start Menu). Control Panel is not obvious. It's virtually impossible to pin things on the dock unless you can find a way to open them. Businesses aren't going to upgrade unless someone uses a touch-screen or tablet (and even then it's doubtful).<p>They should be trying to make users WANT to use Metro--instead of forcing them into it. It's beautiful, great for tablets, and has the apps people crave.

I don't see OStatus doing anything with the latter, and I don't think those people are going to move to public streams, and if they don't move, the other people interspersed with them won't move because it'll become impossible to talk to them.  This is more or less the same reason I still reluctantly keep a LiveJournal: the open-Web facilities for but only show it to these people are severely lacking (and I haven't found a good way of doing anything about this yet).<p>There's also the issue of social networks including things that are <i>de facto</i> currency-like: number of followers on Twitter is an obvious one.  In a distributed network these usually can be faked, or at least are that way on the UI side since it's hard to generate a UI for that that doesn't drive the user's security-related cognitive load through the roof.  (Or reveal more information about subscriptions than people prefer, but that's a shakier reason since some existing networks already reveal that graph.)<p>Is there any push for OStatus or other distributed social network approaches to handle these use cases?

Competing is after all more than about going head on upon all fronts, especialy when there skills and niche were in area's were they could of competed per service upon those platforms and be earning alot more on the service front than they are now and have kept the company at the forfront of peoples minds publicly as well as fiscaly.  They could of also made more money by selling dedicated box's for corporate companies instead of offering software than ran upon others as the only option, a whole area of expansion they missed out upon and another area were they could of made great grounds and added another foothold into company affairs.  I do wonder that if RIM had released nothing new over the past 6 years if they would be any worse of than they are now and that in itself is perhaps the most worrying aspect about were they are now.  Maybe now they plan to attain a position which is were they already currently are from what I can tell, then perhaps things can start looking up.  They will survive, but in what form over time is upto them.  They may start becoming a cheap option for Facebook to move into other mobile revenues and that in itself for most Blackberry users would probably be recieved by mixed feelings.<p>In a World were a qwerty keyboard is needed RIM do the job, but we live in a World that has moved on from the calculator device mentality and today a pocket calculator has to make phone clalls organise the shopping and take the picture for the front cover of Times magazine and if it does not then the fact that it can still add and subtract and the like is completely ignored.  But RIM had and still have the opertunity to move there great email system as a application onto other platforms and flourish nomater how well there handsets sell and how small there margins upon those handsets get.

Over the years RIM's margins have got smaller and smaller and it is that which has help maintain its overall market share with regards to number of devices sold.  So when a CEO makes a albeit pragmatic statement about acheiving a goal of being number 3, then you have to look at were they are now and that is 3rd from what I can tell.  Though it does vary survey to survey and which market you look at as well, so not that easy to get a true picture.  Also the margins in profit per device is a bigger issue that tends not to factor in alot of surveys and then RIM's margin is not just on the device but the onrunning use of its services indirectly via a telco on way or another.<p>But just keeping the footing they have now, is not a bad plan of attack.

Sometimes it would be a lot easier if you ran your own mobile phone network.<p>How about a 'web2.0' mobile operator? Lovely unlocked handsets, open apis, unrestricted pipes, etc",1175551038

8334,comment,122,174,0,0,xinroman,,,"Yeah, but I think Joel's main point was not to outsource customer service people. There's definitely something to be said for working for someone who gives you the trust and freedom to make independent decisions, even when that means losing a customer (as someone who used to bartend, I was happy to get rid of a few) but if you're not close to the company than there's just no way that can work.",1175549037

I also believe that most software patents are ludicrous, so maybe I'm not the person to listen to here.",1175548672

And the articles.<p>Although David added the first sentence about offline apps to get reader attention, his whole post was about his embarrassment about not being able to control himself.  I think offline web apps would actually help him, not hinder him, to work on the things he needs to accomplish in a remote area without AIM, trillian, skype, cell phones, etc to bother thim.",1175548416
8330,comment,8293,8293,0,0,xinroman,,,"To be honest, our answer was pretty vague. We do believe that somewhere down the road we may come up with some new tool or way of doing things that is patentable (heck, if Amazon can do it with ""1-click""...) and will pursue that as it comes up.<p>In the larger picture, though, I don't think that this is going to make or break anybody. I went to a workshop a few weeks ago that was hosted by the Stern School of Business - they had a panel of VCs and one Angel Investor, a startup business pitching to them, and an audience full of people able to ask questions. What was interesting was that one of the first questions the VCs asked after the pitch was ""do you have any patents?"" The answer was a pretty straight-forward ""no."" BUT, when asked about it later by someone in the audience, all of the VCs agreed that they didn't really care that the team didn't have anything patented - that they'd rather see a startup spending their time and energy on implementation than on developing a patent portfolio. Really, they just asked the question because they HAVE to ask the question.<p>I think the larger question here is ""why can't someone else do what you're doing?"" and the ""do you have any patents?"" question is the first logical step in answering that. But it's not the end-all be-all. I'm pretty sure Amazon's success really has very little to do with ""1-click"" and that this wan't even patented until a couple of years ago. (I should check some sources on that...)<p>",1175548345

8326,comment,8293,8293,0,0,volida,,,"I believe they refer to the ideas involving what comprehends your solution to a problem (idea). It's obvious that the problem(idea) you are solving it self cannot be patented, although I think you could just refer to just the problem(idea) you are solving...<p>A patent (software patent) should never be presented as algorithm in the patent application, but rather as a mechansism that automates a process and has results that solve the problem. This is essential difference between papers. And if you study software patents, you will see a ton of claims reffering to the previous claims, in order to describe your mechanism, in order someone could re-create your solution, thats why some companies decide to go the trade-secret way...",1175547819

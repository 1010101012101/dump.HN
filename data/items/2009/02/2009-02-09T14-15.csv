It is not, it is an honest statement, and frankly the meaning of it isn't far from the classical definition of laziness.<p>You know why I write shell scripts? It's not because I'm concerned about clarity, or modularity, it's because I don't want to type ""dhcpcd -k wlan0 && iwconfig wlan0 essid $ESSID && dhcpcd wlan0"" more than once. This is why people have made things like paste, or abbrevs.<p>When I'm writing application code, sure I'll be more concerned with clarity, modularity, efficiency, and the rest of it than I am when I'm basically pasting some command commands into a script - but a good bit of the abstraction that I do in application code also stems out of laziness. I just don't want to type that shit in again, if only a little bit of it would change. Laziness is one tool I use to discover abstractions worth having.<p>Sure, copy-and-paste works too - but that's only laziness in the short-term, and often generates an assload of work in the long-term.

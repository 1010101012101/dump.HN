But this was never about 'Electric cars are awesome now'.<p>I'm pretty sure cars during and before pre Henry Ford times were not very great in terms of their overall affordability, total cost of ownership and availability of fuel all around the country. You could trust your horse to drive you back home on any day more than a car. Similar to that, the IBM computers during their early days. You mobile phone is likely to have more computing power than all the computers IBM sold a few decades back, they were highly painful to use, maintain and use. Needless to say all these things had huge maintenance issues.<p>But these things have caught on. So have automation, productivity and so many other new things that eventually people show friction towards but later take them to be fate accompli and learn to move forward.<p>Electric cars, self driving cars, wearable computing(like Google glasses) well these really might look to be unfeasible at this time. But please, these are just ideas which are waiting for their time to come, with a little push they will eventually catch on.",1348559900

Fuselier was finally convinced of his diagnosis when he read Harris' response to being punished after being caught breaking into a van. Klebold and Harris had avoided prosecution for the robbery by participating in a ""diversion program"" that involved counseling and community service. Both killers feigned regret to obtain an early release, but Harris had relished the opportunity to perform. He wrote an ingratiating letter to his victim offering empathy, rather than just apologies. Fuselier remembers that it was packed with statements like Jeez, I understand now how you feel and I understand what this did to you.<p>""But he wrote that strictly for effect,"" Fuselier said. ""That was complete manipulation. At almost the exact same time, he wrote down his real feelings in his journal: 'Isn't America supposed to be the land of the free?

But the returns aren't so good (because of the higher investment) and the funding dries up. And then all the talent goes overseas.<p>Hollywood can churn out lots of films, and some of them will be hits. This gives the studios more predicable returns. More importantly, they don't have crazy irrational expectations of massive returns, or nothing but flops.<p>A patient investor could arbitrage this.

They don't care about the quality of their graduates, only the quantity. Because the CS degree was shit, it required almost no effort at all and didn't really teach me much. This seems to be a growing trend among institutions that are starting to care more about money than their students.<p>The liberal arts electives I picked up taught me critical thinking, which I think were worth more to me than all the CS components combined. Some people still seek out education as a way to be taught how to learn and think, rather than just a 3+ year job investment.",1348557026

If your position is just that we just don't completely know the situation, then that is fair enough, but that doesn't mean that all possibilities are equally likely.",1348556988

Instead the problem for him was that in his mind the channel read ""happens first"" and how the result from that read is used (i.e. what it is assigned to) shouldn't have any effect on the read anymore. I must say that I agree and would prefer to have a more clearly separate syntax for blocking and non-blocking reads.",1348556928

You can pay 25 cents for 15 minutes, or $1 for 15 minutes and a battery charge.  Parking meters already draw power from the grid, so all they need to do is slap on a measurement tool and an electrical socket.<p>The only reason gas station exists is because one needs to store a great amount of gasoline in a container, but power lines are pretty much everywhere.  Gas stations of tomorrow will be like the coin operated telephones of today.  Most will become toxic barren shells, but few will be converted into toxic waste storage units.<p>Getting gas is an extraneous hassle that people in the future won't need to do anymore.

4569046,comment,4568790,4569025,5,0,rayiner,,,"I was being facetious in response to his barista comment, so no, no citation. My point is simply that while engineering is a valuable degree and leads to great jobs, a liberal arts education is the traditional foundation for careers in banking and politics. Henry Paulson ha a BA in English from Dartmouth. Romney has a BA in English from BYU. Obama has a BA in political science and international relations from Columbia. Empirically, the majority of JD's have an undergraduate degree in liberal arts or social sciences. Anecdotally, the majority of bankers have a liberal arts or social science degree.[1]<p>I'm an engineering major myself so I'm acquainted with the disdain with which engineers view liberal arts types, but it's greatly misplaced. The simple fact is that outside STEM fields, college is more about signaling than education. It is the nature of non-STEM fields that you don't really need to know anything before you start the job. The purpose of college is to learn how to think abstractly and how to write, and to allow employers to separate out the smart, hard-working people.<p>[1] Amusingly, Harvard, a major feeder into the big New York banks, doesn't even have a finance major.",1348556694

My idea is to have it run Android, which would allow anyone to make apps specifically for cars, entertainment or information-based, taking advantage of special API like vehicle speed, fuel, error codes, etc (from OBD2 or ECU). This would bring huge value for car manufacturers(offsetting the development cost) and customers would love the limitless customization possibilities.

At least - that's the current plan.<p>In other words, the transaction cost is split according to 'share' by all the tipjars you are paying into. In practice this translates to worst case scenario 10%, usually far less.<p>Eat your own dogfood is the motto. We don't intend to charge for bandwidth, site development, server hosting, or any of the other costs normal sites have to contend with. We draw the line at paying transaction fees out of our own pockets, that's all.",1180225357

Everyone, Please buy a MAC. Help support the death of a big, dumb, pathetic excuse for a real OS.
Bill Gates, Please stick to games and Office. You have my credit there but really, genuinely, there is no advantage to having to reactivate because I changed my video card. The Genuine advatage program is malware at it's best. 
As far as screwing the customer, Microsoft is all about that. Especially with the 64 bit XP Pro and it's wonderful lack of drivers and wireless support, which I found somewhere else on the web, gave the tip to them and in turn, Microsoft thanked me for my comments and blew me off.
I just now installed over XP Pro on my main PC and am compiling KDE on FreeBSD 6.2.
You are very right sir, they are dead.",1180225162

This was my personal rumination on the differences between the two approaches to OOP. Or a way to verbalize it, if you will.<p>> to my knowledge, you most definitely can not do that in such a manner in Self. Slots manipulation in Self can only be done through primitive messages (e.g. `_AddSlots:`, which takes an object whose slots should be copied into the receiver).
This is probably true, I haven&#x27;t used Self in anger so I will remove that.<p>> I&#x27;m not saying maps-as-objects is great, but I am saying these assertions are 1. wrong and 2. nonsensical.
First thing you do to diss a statement is call it flat out nonsense.<p>> In ES5, the exact same behavior is provided by Object.getPrototypeOf providing access to the internal [[Prototype]]. Most implementations also provide direct access via the __proto__ property, which IIRC ES6 standardizes. And of course the `instanceof` operator has been there since ES3, but that&#x27;s only ~13 years ago.<p>Why do there have to be `typeof`, `instanceof` and `.prototype`? Whereas you actually want one way to get at the object&#x27;s type?<p>> All runtimes but MSIE (unless they&#x27;ve added it in IE11) already implement `const`, and it&#x27;s standardized in ES6.<p>Maybe I should note that I was talking about JS as it is deployable today, to narrow the scope.<p>> You mean, something like ES6&#x27;s yield?

> Terrible exception handling
No objection there, javascript may well have a worse exception handling than Go, a language whose users try very hard to make others believe doesn&#x27;t have exceptions in the first place. At least runtimes are finally trying to generate callbacks worth reading.
Not that this help when mixing with async, as your final traceback will lack 90% of the necessary context.<p>If your stack records the necessary metadata it could easily give you something like `closured on line X in Items.fetchItems` insted of the &#x27;anonymous function&#x27; 5 levels deep.",1383080371

6637323,comment,6636811,6637220,12,0,mjn,,,"One interesting thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that subway systems, long home of one of the more iconic failsafes, the big red lever behind glass connected directly to hydraulic brakes, are moving away from that. An old-style subway (like NYC) has emergency-stop-in-place levers that cause the train to screech to a halt immediately. But automatic train systems, like the Copenhagen Metro, have a similar looking lever that is just a computer signal that signals an emergency condition. The default response (according to the fine-print under it that I recently read) is that the train will continue on to the next station, open its doors, and then hold until further instructions.<p>That part I assume is on purpose, because even a computerized system could have &quot;stop immediately&quot; as the default policy when the emergency lever is pulled. Would be interesting to read the analysis that led to the decision. My guess is that it&#x27;s because on-train issues are statistically the most likely emergency situation a passenger would signal (heart attacks, fights, etc.), in which case continuing to the next station (typically 30-90 seconds) where emergency staff can meet the train and access it, rather than stopping in the middle of a subway tunnel or elevated rail segment, is the most sensible policy.",1383079811

Being alone fills you with anxiety, with isolation, and with uncertainty.  By establishing hard lines, and an aggressive stance, you align yourself with a group and gain peers.  You have allies, friends, and a social tribe that you can look out on the world with.  Your anxiety lessens and you feel more secure.  I&#x27;m not sure if we&#x27;re hardwired for it, but we as humans have a strong tendency towards categorization and &quot;ingroup&quot; / &quot;outgroup&quot; classification of our peers.<p>There&#x27;s a deep rabbit hole at:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety/uncertainty_management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety/uncertainty_management</a><p>Particularly relevant:  &quot;Axiom 20: An increase in perceiving that we share superordinate ingroup identities with strangers will produce a decrease in our anxiety and an increase in our ability to predict their behavior accurately.&quot;",1383079770

How much does a gall bladder surgery cost?  Did I mention that the patient got a flesh-eating bacterial infection as a result of the surgery?  That&#x27;s true and will always be true even if prices were posted at the door, which they are not.<p>The solution - which has been discovered by every advanced nation on Earth except the U.S. - is having the government strongly involved in paying for healthcare, insuring across the entire population to even out costs and making sure that, e.g., medical device manufacturers can&#x27;t gouge the unknowing public.  Monopsony powers nicely counteract the inherent power imbalance that healthcare providers normally have over the sick, and everything works just fine, costing each of those nations less to cover their entire nation than the U.S. currently spends to cover a small segment of its population.",1383078518

It seems to me that functional changes are competitive but aesthetic changes are not.

The wait time isn&#x27;t really relevant to true emergencies (you get seen right away), but people without true emergencies don&#x27;t want to wait. Financial cost is irrelevant (someone else is paying), but the cost to their time is relevant, and so people select emergency rooms (and urgent care clinics) where they will have to wait less. Hospitals are acting on the one thing that the patient cares about (sitting in a waiting room), since the other (price) doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>For the really expensive things, like end of life care, governments with universal healthcare systems are the ones that act with price sensitivity and ration this care and refuse in some cases to pay for the most expensive treatments. For example, the UK has the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which set a maximum of about $47,000 per quality-adjusted year gained. What we refuse to do in the US is allow patients to make a choice like that (instead, we mandate that insurance cover far more in health care expenses, driving up the cost of that insurance). As a comparison, the US sets it supposedly to about $50,000 per QALY, but in practice it tends to be far more, with some regulation-required treatments requiring as much as $500,000 per quality adjusted year (some heart pumps, and kidney dialysis being another very expensive example).",1383078471

Take anything I say about Uber with a grain of salt.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much synergy there actually is between &quot;get a taxi on demand&quot; and &quot;deliver goods on demand.&quot;  I mean, taxis have existed forever.  Presumably, if someone thought it was cost effective, they could have used taxis as a logistics network long ago.  But taxis are really, really, really expensive (and Uber black cars are yet more expensive) in terms of what people expect to pay for shipping.  UPS or the postal service will ship a small package across the country for me for $10 or less.  A taxi in SF won&#x27;t go a mile for $10.<p>Is there some reason to believe that Uber changes the game with regard to all that?  They aren&#x27;t drastically lowering the price of taxis.  Their success has been in raising the service level of taxi-like-services, and in reducing the inconvenience of getting a taxi dispatched to you.  I don&#x27;t say this to take anything away from Uber -- I think they have a fantastic service -- but I don&#x27;t see their successes as being things that really have a lot to do with what you want from a goods distribution network.  If what you want to do is have a very expensive courier service for some kind of physical good, do you really mind calling dispatch and talking to a person?",1383077711

We are relying on the documentation of other products (but on the specific documented claims rather than whether they throw around the term &quot;ACID&quot;).<p>&#x27;Snapshot isolation&#x27; is a level of isolation guarantee, not an implementation technique.  It means that a transaction will read values consistently at one point in history and then write values at a later point, even though the read values may change in between.  To give a classic example, pure snapshot isolation doesn&#x27;t allow you to soundly transfer $100 from Alice&#x27;s account to Bob&#x27;s account.  FoundationDB uses MVCC and optimistic concurrency, but provides serializable isolation.<p>Besides this, and the asynchronous indexing that you mention, RavenDB uses an &quot;XA&quot; type technique for cross-node transactions which relies on the durability of an external transaction coordinator.  Various public statements of the developers lead me to think that they don&#x27;t find this arrangement more trustworthy than I do.<p>&quot;Local&quot; transactions on a single document don&#x27;t qualify as ACID transactions; that&#x27;s one of the primary messages of the page you are linking to.",1383077699

Car insurance <i>does</i> cover car repairs and the car repair market is quite competitive, since insurers are heavily invested in managing prices.<p>The problem here is not insurance. It&#x27;s that health care is a poor fit for free market dynamics.<p>In order for markets to function, consumers need to have the ability to comparison shop. That core requirement is often severely constrained in the health care &quot;market&quot;.<p>One reason is urgency. A great deal of the most expensive health care offers no opportunity for the consumer to comparison shop whatsoever, because it&#x27;s an emergency situation. You&#x27;re wheeled in unconscious on a gurney. Even for non-emergency care, like cancer treatment, it&#x27;s often urgent.<p>Another reason is capital requirements. Doctors and hospitals are extremely expensive to create. In order for markets to function there need to be multiple options to choose from. But the capital requirements of doing so with expensive specialities like oncology significantly retard competition.<p>There is a reason why every other industrialized country in the western world coordinates health care via a single-payer government instead of the free market. And usually with better public health outcomes.<p>Markets are not always the best solution. Consider the fire department &quot;market&quot;. We actually tried that once in the U.S., a long time ago. Houses would pick their own fire company, which competed with one another. You&#x27;d affix an emblem on the front of your house with the company you subscribed to.

(Copy as HTML, etc)<p>3) I seem to have to click on a YouTube video twice for it to pause in Firefox.<p>4) Typing search queries in chrome is easier. For example in Firefox, you can&#x27;t just type define: word to search Google for the definition of &#x27;word&#x27;, as it complains it is not a known command. I don&#x27;t often use URL commands and think you should access about:config from somewhere else.<p>5) In Firefox when you scroll with the mouse you scroll too far per mouse tick.",1383077272

Neural nets are only good at exactly what biological ones are good at; pattern recognition. They can&#x27;t do any optimization at all. They aren&#x27;t going to be rewriting their own code any time soon.<p>Modern computers are <i>millions</i> of times faster than the human brain, and can in theory be made much more energy efficient and compact and probably cheaper.<p>Yes we are still evolving, though at a ridiculously slow pace. And the traits that are currently spreading aren&#x27;t exactly good. The genes responsible for sociopathy are becoming more frequent since we don&#x27;t live in small communities anymore. Intelligence is being strongly selected against at the moment as counter-intuitive as that seems. Less intelligent individuals tend to reproduce far more frequently for whatever reason.<p>&quot;Extelligence&quot; doesn&#x27;t really explain much. Sure a mind on it&#x27;s own might not accomplish much, but we still have to explain what it is about human minds that allow them to think and learn in the first place. Can apes be taught language? If they were would they gain higher level intelligence or does it take more than that? I bet it isn&#x27;t that simple.<p>>You would have to be a stupidly, suicidally cancerous civilization to go around converting whole planets into tools.<p>I don&#x27;t know where your preference comes from but I would love to see the planets get converted into giant computers and minds.

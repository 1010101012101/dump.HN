7256453,comment,7251509,7251509,2,0,louischiffre,,,"Long time lurker here. I am also a programmer who started to learn how to draw. I even put a blog documenting the process. \n<a href=""http://louislearnstodraw.blogspot.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://louislearnstodraw.blogspot.ch/</a>\nSo here is my 2 cent.\nDrawing is definitely more than being able to reproduce a 3d object on a 2d surface, it&#x27;s about understanding how things are constructed and work. For example if you want to draw a steam locomotive, you have to understand what are the parts of a steam engine, how power is generated and transferred to the wheels, how it is built, why the parts have this shape, ... . If you don&#x27;t have this understanding, there is no way you can draw a steam locomotive from imagination. Of course you can do a nice copy with beautiful rendering that will look nice, but drawing something that is realistic will be very difficult.\nSince I started learning to draw, I learned a lot of things on a variety of subjects: entomology, anatomy, marine biology, history, technology,... When I visit a new city the first thing I look up are the museums, where I then go to draw.\nI could elaborate more on that subject but I have to run. Let me know if there is any interest.",1392699214
7256452,comment,7252500,7256313,10,0,trout,,,"Not a flame - your perspective is very typical for people that don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with networking past the host or server level. (Very little experience with networking in the core, provider, or putting together network services architecture).<p>1. In theory the routing table with IPv6 can be smaller. The address design should be hierarchical, which means you should be able to have much fewer routes. It&#x27;s too early to tell if this is actually true or not, but the addresses themselves are 4x larger - which isn&#x27;t going to be the determining factor in routing table size.<p>2. Not everything needs to be publically routable, true. IPv6 has the idea of link local and autonomous system local addressing which IPv4 doesn&#x27;t have. The RFC 1918 block was used instead. But think for a second - there&#x27;s only 4 billion addresses (less when you count bogons and multicast ranges), and it&#x27;s only a matter of time until those are taken up. So we can choose to do it now, 2 years from now, or 5 years from now, but devices are growing faster than ever and it&#x27;s only a function of time.<p>3. NAT is not a security feature, is not good for the internet, and the sunk costs spent building an ALG for every protocol to work around it is a significant development sinkhole. It&#x27;s a workaround often masqueraded as security, and does cause many application problems. It&#x27;s just not normally the application developers that have to fix those problems - it&#x27;s the network and security teams.<p>4. IPv6 was created in the late 90&#x27;s. People have been waiting for brilliance to supercede IPv6 for a while. I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s not the easiest, but there are a certain set of problems you have when you expand the address space.<p>5. I&#x27;m familiar with all the IPv4 headers, and nearly all of them are used. ID is used for packet identification, particularly through network services, DSCP is used heavily, DF and other flags are used - they&#x27;re just obscure. If you look at IPv6 those same headers are basically recreated, though with slightly different names. The ones that aren&#x27;t included are addressable through the extension headers.<p>So, yeah. That&#x27;s another perspective that may help you understand why IPv6 is a bit of a quagmire. The faster people understand this, the sooner we get to a place where the chicken-egg problem fades away.",1392699163

People start doubting their sanity -- &quot;Oh I swear I saw it crash, that one time, or ...did I, maybe I was tired...&quot;.<p>Someone (could have even been Jesper Andersen, the author) said that the biggest performance gain an application gets is when it goes from not working or being crashed to working.

This includes a mix of stock/yearly comp.<p>Depending on hiring circumstances you can potentially push this.  If there is a need, the will find a way to make things work out.<p>Once hired, from the employees perspective, it becomes a game of maintaining expectations.  Unfortunately for the employee, in the case of startups (especially early), the expectations are quite high and any extra effort is tied in to the initial offer/hiring agreement.<p>Early stage startups are a gamble.  There are often unexpected twists and turns.  If you agree to X and Y at time T, three months down the line, the expectations at time U may be much greater.<p>As a non founding employee, your initial contract starts when you join with the expectations around the company when you joined.  Carrying those same expectations along the way if the company is not growing in the same manner as you expected is a detriment to yourself.<p>When you realize this, it is time to re-evaluate and decide what is right for your current situation.<p>Does if fit your initial agreement?

7256400,comment,7242155,7251085,1,0,SamReidHughes,,,"> Controlling climate via human actions requires far more than simply postulating that Doppler radar works.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not saying that it doesn&#x27;t (well it was obvious to me...).  It&#x27;s a stand-in for everything you&#x27;d use.  The point is, it&#x27;s beliefs that stuff you see working will continue working, be it radar or temperature gauges, the laws of physics, or mathematical simplifications or approximations.  There is presumably <i>some</i> reason why some seemingly totally made up constants aren&#x27;t actually 10 times the chosen values, or why it doesn&#x27;t matter, or how likely that&#x27;s the case.  The difference between this and beliefs about God is that if you don&#x27;t have reasons why you think the CO2 reading are wrong or why physics will change or why certain mathematical simplifications will stop working, you have to give reasons, you&#x27;re, epistemologically speaking, discarding empiricism from your toolbox.  You can&#x27;t simply go &quot;Laa dee daa I&#x27;m picking different priors than you.&quot;  There has to be some reason (though it might be that <i>they&#x27;re</i> going laa dee daa).<p>> Admitting the possibility that god (or god-like beings) exists does not require throwing away belief in empirical reality.<p>That&#x27;s what I said.  The difference is that unlike science and measurements of reality, there&#x27;s no endless stream of evidence to beat your initial priors out of you.  Unless you have 100% faith that past events can&#x27;t be used to predict future outcomes, you&#x27;ll get dragged over to the empiricist side.  But you could have 90% faith in Christianity and maybe that&#x27;ll only get beaten down to 40%, because there&#x27;s just no evidence.  (Not to mention the more practical way to get people to change their beliefs, no visible consequences for being wrong, either.)<p>> it takes a ridiculously tiny amount of evidence or an infinitesimally different prior to put you back into Pascal&#x27;s wager territory.<p>Sure.  But the same goes for putting you into anti-Christianity territory.  The expected displacement a tiny amount of evidence would push you is 0 (if we regard the continued absence of new evidence to be evidence itself (e: and assuming potential &quot;big&quot; evidence is neglible, of course)).  The whole argument against Pascal&#x27;s wager is that it&#x27;s about what your priors are.<p>And yeah, I don&#x27;t know what TheEzEzz&#x27;s 50/50 symmetry is all about.",1392697984

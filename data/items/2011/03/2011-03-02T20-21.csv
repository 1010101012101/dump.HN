2281281,comment,2279655,2281083,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Lets crunch some simple numbers.<p>Suppose 1 in 100 children is sexually abused <i>for the first time</i> in any given semester [1], and a teacher has 4 classes of 30 students each. Then in 2.5% of classes, a teacher will have 4 sexually abused children (vs an average of 1.2). When this occurs, the percentage of children failing will increase by 2.3%.<p>So lets say on average, a teacher is expected to have a failure rate of 20%. 2.5% of the time (roughly once in their career) they get unlucky and have a failure rate of 22.3% instead of 20%. This will occur 2 semesters in a row about one time in 1500, i.e. it will happen to 1 in 50 teachers (assuming a 30 year teaching career).<p>Alternative numbers, to show that I'm not using cherry picked numbers: P(abuse)=0.001, P(4 abuses in class of 120) = 2.56e-6, slightly greater impact (failure rate goes up to 23.3% over 20%). If sexual abuse happens at a higher rate (e.g. 2%), then we get into the rather implausible situation that 48% of children are sexually abused, resulting in them failing school.<p>[1] I don't know the relative proportions, but this seems like a high number. Among other things, it would imply that at least 24% of children are sexually abused, resulting in them failing school. We are also assuming the child has a good upbringing and good grades until the sexual abuse, which I imagine is not the most common situation. The assumption that it is the first instance of sexual abuse is important, because if it occurred in the prior year, it would likely affect their prior year grades and hence their current predicted grades.",1299099507

You’ll get a healty share of equity and the opportunity to build a solution that doesn’t currently exist</i><p>I am not trying to rain on your parade or discourage you but, I don't want to sugar coat the reality of what you are looking for is tough to find either. With no salary you are going to have to look to lower your standards.<p>The title you are looking for with the job description you provided is a CTO and one with previous experience and 5-10 years under there belt, if successful can command $150-$200k on the open market.<p>Further, many already have an existing network of people looking to recruit them into their ventures or most importantly they have there own ideas that they would rather pursue for a larger equity stake than you can offer if you are not offering a salary. Essentially what the prospect hears is; come work on my project for free and we will give you 20% if we make it, meanwhile you are competing with the reality that the prospect is thinking well I can work for free on my own idea and keep 100% if I make it.<p>So the reality is you have to find someone who, really, really likes your idea, and unfortunately you ad says nothing about it, you pretty much have to explain you idea in black and white and hope someone of that caliber really likes it. Just to get them to look your way you are going to tell them who you are, what you are doing, why it matters, and how you plan to make it successful. It is no different than pitching a VC, you are asking this person to invest in your vision with their time. You have to give them a reason to be interested. Take your ad from above and imaging that that was going to be your pitch to get VC, would you use it? If not you are going about getting the person you want all wrong.",1299099340

They're not selling $20 pairs of jeans, here. They're selling expensive stuff that requires a conscious decision to purchase. Apple needs to provide a compelling case to move their product. It's not practical to buy something just because it's from Apple. It has to actually do something for you as a user.<p>> Apple has very good PR.<p>This line is exhausting. Apple has very good <i>products</i>. The great marketing and PR is a result of having very good products.<p>You can't sell 15 million units of a brand new, $500 product in nine months on the strength of TV ads and magazine pieces. It has to <i>actually work well</i>. There may be an initial element of brand trust to grease the skids for launch but sustained sales require something <i>real</i>.<p>My parents aren't Apple fans. They're not nerds. They spend a lot of time frustrated with technology. They're nuts about their iPad because it works really well. That's it. Adding a USB port isn't going to make them like it better. It's going to make it more complex, which is going to degrade their experience in using it.<p>""Oh, well, that whole 12 hour battery thing? Doesn't count if you use the USB port. Then it's something else.""<p>""What? Why?""<p>""USB uses power.""<p>""Why?""<p>etc.<p>> Pointing to large sales numbers as a counter-argument to criticism is just plain silly.<p>You continue to miss the point. The criticism isn't valid. Apple has sold a shitload of iPads on the strength of its simplicity. You're talking about making it less simple. In that case, its success is more than ample refutation of your assertion that adding junk to its spec list is going to somehow improve things.<p>It's like saying, around 1950 ""Hey, turn the automobile into a Rhinoceros – then it'll be able to hit things with its horns.""<p>""But people don't buy cars to do that. Look how well they're selling.""<p>""Sales are not a valid refutation of my criticism that cars have no horns to hit things with!""<p>etc.<p>But like I said: Chalking it all up to clever marketing, instead of painstaking investments in software design, hardware fabrication and supply chain optimization is how everyone else keeps dropping the ball while Apple sprints all the way to the bank year after year.",1299099335

I am not yet sure that our society really is not skewed. Or at least there might not be a universal law protecting the chances for the ""small people"". It seems possible that in a few years time, Apple Facebook and Google control the internet and again the options of the small people will be reduced to low-margin sharecropping.<p>Atm I am leaning to the belief that chances are good enough. If that is the case, the only sensible estimate for the fair price of work seems to be market value. I have yet to see another definition of fair that works. So if the employers can get away with paying their employees little money, it must be because the market does not afford more. There might be millions of jobless waiting to take over their jobs, for example - what would the jobless think about the fair price for a job?<p>Then again, politics define at least some of the rules of the market (as an extreme example, government could decree a maximum wage) .

When they start up again it is piled high, and you need to have people work overtime or hire more until you've worked through the backlogs.

2281066,story,,,1,3,sorchr,"Ask HN: From a free product to a commercial product",,"Greetings,<p>Nearly one year ago I released a free .NET profiler [1]. I started coding it to solve a unique problem; a problem none of the available profilers could help me with. It was a fun experience and a much needed break from the day-to-day business of shuffling data between a UI and a db. Due to this joyous experience I created a generic profiler in my spare time and, as previously stated, released a public free version - mostly just for the fun of it.<p>I focused almost entirely on coding features that were interesting to do, but not all that useful in terms of profiling features or problem solving. A few months ago I started thinking how much fun it would be to get paid for doing this kind of programming and started to focus on making the profiler more useful. The ultimate goal is of course to turn it into a mISV and eventually make a living of it.<p>So do any of you have any experience in re-launching a free software development tool as a commercial one – or know of any tales in that category?<p>I am currently thinking of giving the software a new name and a new site (name and site already known and registered) and sort of start from scratch. The current versions will continue to work, but will not be updated.<p>Marketing seems to be the major factor of success – it is also the area where I have the least experience. Besides the ambiguous advice of creating a blog, what other marketing areas do people have good experiences with? 
  I have already used Google AdWords a bit and made <i>one</i> comment about the profiler on a MS MVP's blog – so far the profiler usage is in the <i>very</i> modest range [2] - probably due to the lack of marketing and lack of useful features.<p>I would love to hear tales of the yields of investing a significant amount of cash in the marketing effort of development tools (magazines, conference stands and similar), compared to just let it grow more organically (with a modest AdWords budget) - and of course any other advice people might have.<p>Thanks!<p>[1]: http://www.xteprofiler.com

I'm now working part-time and learning programming (Java, .NET, SQL, web scripting) full-time.<p>Why?  3 reasons.<p>1) I am sick and tired of not knowing how to create solutions that add real, measurable value to almost any human task imaginable.

What I think they're doing is they're looking at friends on facebook, then their networks and making the assumption that the person will have a gmail account, then guessing what it might be. Sometimes I'm cc'd into variants of potential spelling like firstname.lastname@gmail, flastname@gmail etc. but most of the time it's a bcc. If you bear in mind that my profile has a distinctly odd name which used to be a googlewhack and that most of my friends friends on facebook are in the UK and in the same industry (I use multiple profiles for multiple purposes).",1299096021

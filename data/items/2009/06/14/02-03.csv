If it's some sort of Top X list, TechCrunch or CNet almost always have the best ones, but you'll definitely have a hard time finding actual programming-related articles. In fact, I have more fun reading through the comments here on HN and the given blog/website than the actual articles themselves; I would not be able to count the amount of times a bug with a piece of code was fixed thanks to a guy writing a comment on the blogs.",1244947524

656736,comment,656649,656649,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"sorry for the long comment but I had to address these because they're all kind of silly to me.<p>Men Like Blonde Bombshells: The article claims this is all but universal but...to be honest...I like redheads.  So that's disproved right there.<p>Humans are naturally polygamous: Well...duh.  If this is so politically incorrect why did I learn it in my 8th grade science class?<p>Most women benefit from polygymy: The example they give as ""proof"" is women can share wealthy men in polygamous societies.  That only works if women value wealth overall.  I can show you thousands of studies where a poor man got the girl by being more attentive than a rich man.  So this is bunk,<p>Most suicide bombers are Muslim: Well again...duh.  The sheer number of muslims combined with their religion being in a struggle between fundamentalism and progressivism pretty much guarantees that.  But that probably wasn't the case 2,000 years ago and it probably won't be the case 2,000 years from now.<p>Having sons reduces the likelihood of divorce: Maybe.  But it seems like a pretty complicated thought process to be an instinct.  Most men I know don't consider how they're going to pass on wealth to their son when getting divorced.<p>Beautiful people have more daughters: Completely unproven hypothesis.<p>What Gates and McCarthy have in common with criminals: Stupid.  Yes, young people take more risks and people who take more risks produce more.  That's common in all humans.<p>It's natural for politicians to risk everything for an affair: Politicians are risk takers.  Duh.  They're in a job where they have to win over millions of people every few years or lose their job.<p>Men sexually harass women because they are not sexist: Their theory is that men treat women aggressively just like they do men so they aren't sexist.  But not being sexist means realizing women are different than men and treating them accordingly so their theory is nothing more than a word game.",1244946654

656730,comment,656641,656641,0,0,wooby,,,"I ran into a paper called ""The Next 700 Languages"" while doing Scala research.  The paper, written in 1966, is lengthy but awesome.  Its conclusion reminded me a lot of PGs paper, which I hadn't read:<p>The languages people use to communicate with computers differ in their intended aptitudes, towards either a particular application area, or a particular phase of computer use (high level programming, program assembly, job scheduling, etc). They also differ in physical appearance, and more important, in logical structure. The question arises, do the idiosyncracies reflect basic logical properties of the situations that are being catered for?  Or are they accidents of history and personal background that may be obscuring fruitful developments? This question is clearly important if we are trying to predict or influence language evolution.<p>To answer it we must think in terms, not of languages, but of families of languages. That is to say we must systematize their design so that a new language is a point chosen from a well-mapped space, rather than a laboriously devised construction.<p>PDF: <a href=""http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~blume/classes/aut2008/proglang/papers/Landin-next-700.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~blume/classes/aut2008/proglang/pap...</a>",1244946044

Once you path the program in memory and see everything to your liking, you fire up a hex editor and patch that memory region. Patching is an <i>art</i>; if you new instruction can overwrite a region of the code, you can insert a jump to the new instructions, then 'ret'urn from them with another jmp to your call point. If, otoh, you're adding more code than the instructions you're replacing, then you will need to find more places to stuff it, or you might need to reconstruct the program header and adjust the sizes.<p>This is called reverse engineering, google it.",1244945815

There is very little in the way of quantitative data to say.  Although this bit of quantitative data caught my eye:<p>""About one third of the Japanese workforce is now casual or part-time""<p>That seems a huge number to me, and could account for some of the claimed changes in the culture.<p>I also found interesting the inclusion of ""has a liking for deserts and foreign travel.""

Some prefer symbolic worlds, others the physical, and most the social.<p>Schools are currently poor places to learn about any of those.

Rampant alcohol abuse and unreasonable sexual promiscuity in universities are the inevitable backlash to years of social repression, far beyond the young ages at which it might be called for.<p>It was not unreasonable in earlier times to consider someone a ""young man"" or ""young woman"" at 13 or 14, and as a fully functional society member at 16.

It is only coincidence that the cleaners are employees on the books.  What about the people who make the textbooks they read, or the iPhones they use?<p>Inequality is important, but it is a society-wide issue.  Reducing inequality <i>within a company</i> is a meaningless goal.<p>There is already a very effective way of reducing inequality, which has the advantage of being completely even handed.  It&#x27;s called income tax.<p>Controlling costs is also good in itself, but that is a separate issue.  Running an entire university is a position of great importance, and the salaries mentioned seem in line with this level of responsibility.  (Not that people deserve more money because they have more responsibility.  The point is that these position require the best people, who will demand higher salaries).",1393135186

Writing equations in Word is pain, inserting bibliography is pain, inserting figures is pain. Printed results do not match screen version, if you need to collaborate with someone you have problems with diffs and different versions of Word.\nAnother use for LaTeX is making slides for presentations. Word or Markdown can&#x27;t be used for this.\nAnd if you use PowerPoint for slides you are in trouble.

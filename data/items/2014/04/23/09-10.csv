Looking at RFC 3022 &quot;Traditional IP Network Address Translator&quot; it looks like usually unique port numbers are allocated per connection.  Maybe there are protocol subtitles or security implications that keep implementors from going with &quot;port sharing&quot; NAT?<p>My argument still stands in case all peers behind a common NAT router try to access the same IPv4 server (which may just happen with centralized services like youtube/facebook/google).  It also stands in case UDP based services are used (stuff depending on a Cone NAT and using STUN like VoIP or online gaming).",1398247189

I know a guy in the UK who spends about 5-6 hours per week studying Chinese (3-4 hours on Skype with a tutor, plus time studying) and he&#x27;s made steady progress.  However, you&#x27;ve got to put in dedicated time outside your lessons to try composition, practice listening etc.<p>Having said that, below are some resources worth investigating:<p>Audio courses:<p>- Pimsleur Mandarin (3 sets of 30 half-hour lessons.

Just search google for &#x27;learning pinyin&#x27; and you will find lots of free resources.  There are three things worth trying to master here:<p>- Pronunciation of each of the four tones (actually five, as there is also a neutral tone)<p>- Pronunciation of each of the 21 initials (b, p, m, f etc., most of which are the same as English, but some, like x, z, c, zh are very different) and each of the 35 ‘finals’ (like -ong, -uang, -in etc.)<p>- (later) Some words consist of more than one syllable, and there are some rules for when tones change based on the tone of the following syllable.<p>Dictionary:<p>- Pleco for iphone or Android: the free version is a must-have.  There are bundles for additional functionality.  The two additional functions I use(d) are the full-screen handwriting input (paid on iphone) and the spaced-repetition flashcard functionality (paid).  This app is the reason I bought my first iOS device.<p>- Nciku (online dictionary; search by pinyin or by writing the character)<p>Reading/writing characters (probably work on some basic oral Chinese before doing this):<p>- Skritter.com (subscription-based service best used with a mouse or Wacom tablet; doesn’t work well with a laptop touchpad)<p>- Book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Writing-Chinese-Simplified-Character/dp/0804835098/ref=pd_sim_b_12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Writing-Chinese-Simplified-Cha...</a>",1398246745

7633023,comment,7632094,7632866,42,0,diydsp,,,"> men and women simply have different kinds of friendships<p>I think you nailed it there.  This matches what I&#x27;ve been picking up from books by Deborah Tannen, an author recommended to me by a guy at work.<p>Tannen describes men and women as having two massively different styles of communication.  Communication is not at all addressed in the attached article, yet, when I perceive the dialogue in the article, it matches Tannen&#x27;s model to a T.  In a nutshell: men communicate in the domain of independence while women communicate about intimacy.  If you remember _nothing_ else about what I write here, remember those two words: intimacy vs. independence.<p>So for example, when the wife in the article repeatedly asks for &quot;dish,&quot; that&#x27;s a blatant signal of intimacy.  She wants to be in on secrets.  She wants intimacy with her husband and is sending out &quot;sonar&quot; to see how intimate her husband is with his friends.  Even her use of the idiosyncratic term &quot;dish&quot; and expecting her husband to pick up on it can be perceived as calls for intimacy.<p>Meanwhile, when the author describes &quot;activity&quot; or &quot;convenience&quot; friends, (with an undeserving negative air), he&#x27;s failing to perceive that these types of friendship allow the men to preserve their independence.  It also explains why the men felt intruded upon when the women scheduled an activity for them.  The author perceives it in the parent-child spectrum, which is okay, but not insightful imo.  Tannen&#x27;s model of men&#x27;s independence I find superior.  It also explains the author&#x27;s ignoring phone calls from his friend - it&#x27;s a meta-communication about preserving his own independence.<p>Just to get meta about publishing in the 2010s, the article is a smorgasbord of irritainment, pseudo-psychology and self-doubt.  Certainly not the kind of thing most men would find useful, valuable or insightful.  Although that certainly doesn&#x27;t it make the author &quot;gay&quot; as someone below suggested!  However, this article is neither empowering through interdependence nor through independence, just a slab of rage press with a bit of correlation without causation statistics.  (Can&#x27;t you just hear an editor saying &quot;Great, now finish up with some stats to back it up.&quot;)<p>So let&#x27;s read Tannen&#x27;s books to help our relationships and communication along, then get back to talking about Linux and signal processing and shit.",1398246210

7632956,comment,7629485,7630867,3,0,zenazn,,,"Yeah, I looked at gocraft/web for a long time before writing Goji. It&#x27;s a good library, and I think it does a lot of things right. But at the end of the day, just like my disagreement with Martini, this comes down to a difference in principles. I think there are two theories of Go library design here. One of us has chosen one, one the other, and let me prefix this by saying that I&#x27;m not sure the way I chose is correct.<p>On one hand, a library can allow its users access to typed structs—this is the way gocraft/web does it. The upside here is huge: applications are now type-safe, and can lean on the compiler to enforce their own correctness. The library code that backs this behavior can be arbitrarily gnarly, but you only have to write it once, after which it&#x27;ll Probably Be Correct (tm).<p>On the other hand, you can provide a standard &quot;universal&quot; context type like Goji does. Since the library makes no statements about the sorts of fields you have or their types, applications have to do a bunch of shenanigans with type casts in order to extract the typed values they expect. The upside here, however, is the standardization and what that allows. I&#x27;ve found that in most of the web applications I&#x27;ve built, only a small fraction of the middleware is authored by me: I end up pulling in the standard request logging middleware, or the middleware that assigns request IDs, or the middleware that does CSRF protection. There&#x27;s a huge amount of value in being able to write (read: &quot;let someone else write&quot;) those middlewares <i>once</i> and being able to use them in any application. With arbitrary application-provided structs, this isn&#x27;t possible [1], but if you can instead standardize on types and keys out-of-band, you can mix and match arbitrary middleware with impunity.<p>This alone is one of those awkward engineering tradeoffs where you&#x27;re exchanging one nice thing (application-level type safety) for another (standard interface, and hopefully an ecosystem of drop-in middleware), and given just this I&#x27;d argue that the ecosystem is probably more important. But the frosting on this particular cake is that, with only marginally more awkwardness, you can actually get application-level type safety too: look at what I did for the request ID middleware that ships with Goji, for instance (<a href=""https://github.com/zenazn/goji/blob/master/web/middleware/request_id.go#L55-L69"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zenazn/goji/blob/master/web/middleware/re...</a>). Again, it&#x27;s not quite as nice as a user-defined struct, but in the grand scheme of tradeoffs and sacrifices, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so terribly bad.<p>So TL;DR, Goji chose standardization and composability in the design of its context object over application type safety, but if you&#x27;re willing to write a few helper functions I don&#x27;t think you end up losing the type safety anyways.<p>[1]: actually, come to think of it, with a lot of reflection and some struct tags you could probably pull it off. (Something like &quot;struct { RequestID string `context:&quot;reqid&quot;`}&quot;, and the request ID assigning middleware would hunt around for a string field tagged &quot;reqid&quot;). But it seems like it&#x27;d introduce a lot of coupling between middleware and the application which I&#x27;m not sure will turn out well—any time a middleware needed a bit of extra storage, every application would have to change. In any event, if someone builds this I&#x27;d love to play around with it.",1398244571

7632924,comment,7631449,7631449,1,0,mattlutze,,,"The comments complaining about the paging circles on the front page seem to have missed the big arrows on either side. Seems to be a rather standard pager from where I&#x27;m sitting. That said, layout on the front page for said pager is still kinda odd, particularly when the browser window is short -- the pager elements roll into the footer of the page and text content is awkwardly cut off. Overall though, I appreciate the ascetic aesthetic. I&#x27;m rather aggressive with blocking ads, so perhaps the volumes of negative space on the right side of the page are normally full, but the spacing around elements in their list boxes is well balanced and makes it all quite easy to skim.<p>I didn&#x27;t use Crunchbase 1.x much and don&#x27;t really have an opinion on whether this is an improvement.

When they take offense it&#x27;s always a blow to me since I don&#x27;t want to be That Guy, but I have to admit that I get the same sense that people I really click with don&#x27;t even bother taking offense at that stuff. They&#x27;re okay with having a conversation that has some conjecture and vulnerability, and some difficulty of thought conveyance, built into it.<p>Conversely, I get a really bad impression when the defense mechanism rolls out, particularly so when it&#x27;s elaborate, practiced, and snarky. A strong rejection indicates that I&#x27;ve tread into territory they&#x27;d really want to not dwell upon. Extreme snark is even worse since it indicates that their intention is to control the power dynamic.

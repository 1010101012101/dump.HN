This prevents anyone except the manufacturer from updating or modifying even the most significant copyleft portions of Android (the kernel). Availability of free software is useless in that case. This is one of the ""exploitable"" weaknesses of GPLv2 that TiVo has pioneered and why GPLv3 was created. So, while yes, the Linux kernel on Motorola's recent phones is GPL free software, it's a moot point because you can't use anything except Motorola's blessed bits.",1302789536

2446792,comment,2445447,2445447,14,0,ghshephard,,,"Joel's article is pretty good as a starting point, but, I think there is a lot of variation on what the first set of employees get.<p>I've been a first 10 employee (As an infrastructure contributor, not core engineer) twice in companies that eventually were valued at greater than $1 Billion.  The first time I received 0.03% Equity (Before Dilution) - the second time I received 0.1% Equity (Before lots of dilution).<p>For one of those companies, I know that some of the core engineers received 3-4x what I did, so - extracting to all of the six core engineers in Layer 1, Plus the Administrative crew - comes around 6 * .4% + 3 * .1% = about 2.7% for the first nine employees.  We had our series A before anybody came on board, as an employee.<p>There is probably a different allocation method for teams comprised of ""Serial Entrepreneurs"" - Your risk in joining that team is much less, so your equity is typically much less.  Also, the approach usually goes like the following:<p>Step 1: Two - Four Founders create a company.  Roughly sharing the equity, though, if there is a ""Named"" founder that will Garner Press/Financing/Customers, they take a bigger chunk.<p>Step 2: Founders brainstorm for  month or two, commit to working together for a minimum of four-five years, and then go pitch their preferred VCs.  VCs give them a valuation of $5-$10mm (pre-money) and invest $1mm-$2mm.<p>Step 3: First 5-10 Employees are hired, with a stock pool of 3%-10% - Sr. Employees with a great track record who currently have great jobs at Google/Facebook/etc.. will require a larger equity share.  Out of work contributors who have a solid, if not exceptional track record will receive significantly less.  The team now has a clock ticking, and has to demonstrate some traction within six-nine months to get their next round before the money runs out.",1302789353

2446789,comment,2442274,2445433,1,0,hga,,,"Well, be sure to e.g. factor in the terrible age discrimination in the former field (I have no knowledge of  Computational Math as a career).  Conventional, salaried  programming careers end around age 35-40 and get totally impossible at 50 unless you can go the consultant route, specialize in one of the fields that respects gray hairs (e.g. embedded to some extent) or walk on water.<p>I had a friend who did that, finishing at about age 40 (and looking it due to premature gray hair).  She never found a job, which is a terrible shame since she has ""the spark"" for programming which is rare in men and very very rare in women (she's the 3rd I've ever met in my 50 years on this earth---and as someone who until a year ago could pass for a college student my personal anecdotal data on age discrimination is rather solid).<p>On the other hand, if you're going to go the YC sort of route to start your own company, weight the risks of course but go for it!  You'll get a mental toolbox which will do you well when you need to tackle difficult problems, and in many ways this field is like von Clausewitz's description of war, ""Everything in war is simple, but the simplest thing is difficult.""<p>As Microsoft and its competitors' history shows consistently writing software that works is harder than most people think.  pg commented in one of his essays that a whole lot of the dot.com bubble era's failures were technical---well, their business model also may have had no chance, but they never got to the point of trying that.

Part of their implicit contract with you is that they'll make available to you the resources necessary to complete your major in 4 years (although that can get difficult with laboratories that have highly finite sizes, e.g. a chemistry lab with N hoods) and they won't intentionally limit capacity with  ""weed out"" courses.  At the worst case some big colleges are less of a bargain than they appear since you have to take 5+ years to get into all the required courses due to capacity issues.<p>Or take the half of the big 4 CS schools: Berkeley is like many if not most big public schools in requiring you apply to either their Engineering or ""Letters and Science"" schools, and you can't take EECS without getting into the former, CS without getting into one of either (or at least that's what they say on their home page, their may be exceptions of course).<p>CMU is unusual for a private school in that you have to apply to their CS department which has a fixed per year class size of 135 (last time I checked).  MIT and I gather Stanford are like most? private colleges in that acceptance allows you to major in anything you can do and to switch if you want to.  If a major doubles in size ""overnight"" they'll move heaven and earth to accommodate the undergrads (which is a or the major theme of this blog posting, some panic that Stanford CS major enrollment is exploding).<p>MIT, mindful of the transitory popularly of fields (e.g. look at the early '70s areo-astro crash from which the field never recovered) has never let the EECS department---the number of professors and graduate students---get ""too big"", which sure appeared wise after the dot.com crash which resulted in undergraduate enrollment falling by more than 1/2.  That put <i>great</i> stress on the department when it had 40% of the undergraduates in the 80s and 90s (and which they may be returning to, with their ""CS1"" course enrollment exploding from 250 last spring to 380 this spring).

All alternatives depend on credit cards, which are not nearly as common outside the US.<p>I am aware of the horror stories around PayPal but I haven't had any serious problems in the last few years and I do hundreds of (recurring) transactions per day with them.<p>That said there is a pretty long list of annoying bugs in PayPal's recurring billing solution and most of the bugs have been in there for years. The technical bugs you can work around, but the ""usability"" bugs are quite annoying:<p>* If a user changes his credit card it will cancel all his subscriptions, unless he follows a specific set of steps that he won't find out about until it's too late<p>* If a user want to change a subscription and uses a different account to log into PayPal than the one he signed up with he gets the unhelpful error message that his ""subscription has expired""<p>* If a user has two or more subscriptions and tries to change one PayPal will present him with a list of which one to change. This is a list of cryptic numbers. If he picks the wrong one it is near impossible to correct without canceling and resubscribing<p>* There is no way to pro-rate a subscription: if someone makes an annual payment for bronze tier and a day later decides to switch to silver tier PayPal will not charge the new price until a year from now.<p>I could go one. There are also internationalizations issues but I guess those only apply when you are outside the US like I am. (E.g. If you are outside the US then all the amounts in messages to your customers get formatted with a comma as a decimal separator, even if your customers are in US and you have your language set to US English).

2446648,comment,2446385,2446548,3,0,arctangent,,,"Fellow UK resident here.<p>The political reasoning behind the hike in fees is to make young people think harder about whether a university degree is actually going to be useful to them in their career. It's fairly clear that vocational courses would benefit some people a lot more than theoretical/academic courses, and society would benefit from this too.<p>At the moment young people tend to go to university by default, and there were (until recently) frequent stories about universities offering nonsense degrees just so they can claim funding from the government. I can't blame the those students who, in the past, went to university for 3 years just to learn how to be independent, make some friends and party. I don't think they'll do it if the privilege costs them several thousand pounds.<p>However, our current government in the UK has signalled a change - there is a feeling that making university easy to go to has manipulated unemployment figures downwards and has not really had the desired effect that you might expect from higher education. Historically, university attendance was much lower - not because of a lack of ""fairness"" in society but because society accepted that only the brightest and most motivated went to such a place.<p>I'd prefer it if young people didn't have to pay money to go to university but it's in society's interest that those who do go are recognised as having gone there for the right reasons and are qualified to do something productive. If there's a price attached to a degree then universities will (presumably) try harder to ensure that the value they provide is comparable with the fees charged by other universities.<p>To the original poster I would say this: If you think you're smart then you might as well stick it out and get a degree, especially if you think you have a chance of going to a top UK university. You will find it very difficult to get a degree later in life when you have more responsibilities. Degrees are still cheap in the UK compared to the USA (especially if you think you will one day earn an above-average salary).",1302786314

Perhaps it's overly optimistic regarding the quality of education one would get for $80k, but it's not a lie. Sure, you can get very well-rounded by reading books on your own but there's a tremendous amount of value to be gotten from going to college too, maybe even a different kind of value, or for a different person.<p>I took a fair amount of higher level math in college and I really don't think I would have had the same experience studying that stuff on my own. I'm sure there are people who can read abstract algebra, analysis, and geometry textbooks on their own and get 100% of the understanding a good professor would try to impart during lectures, but I bet they are rare. In 16-18-yr olds, probably quite rare.<p>Regarding liberal arts courses, I had the opportunity to study Japanese literature and film with some really great professors, and that's something I could have obviously done on my own (watch movies, read books, write critical papers and mull over them by myself). But it's not the same. Maybe not better, maybe not worse, but I disagree with your assumption that self-study is a drop in replacement for college.<p>""Doing a startup"" probably offers a great deal of opportunities for personal growth and well-roundedness, but I really don't think it's going to be the same as studying things like upper division math, compilers, the French new wave in depth at a decent university class.<p>I completely agree that college is totally over-priced.

It also never had much of a foothold as a non-gaming machine in the home.<p>The IBM-compatible PC was the focus of innovation from many different companies. It wasn't a one-vendor platform like the Amiga. That is the ultimate cause of its demise. If the  fate of the PC had stayed tied to IBM, it would have suffered the same end. Apple had a similar problem with the Macintosh in the 1990s and it almost killed them. If Apple's stewardship ever wavers, that is sure to happen again. It will take a lot more before it can become an immortal (undead?) platform like the PC.",1302786079

Graduating in two months. Payed about 5000 Euros for 5 years of engineering education. 
Got about 25k from the government for living expenses. More than half of it as a grant - independent of my grades, as long as I passed.*<p>I'm European, too. Of course, if you live in Scandinavia its even better than here in Germany. And yes, our system has lots of mistakes und isn't very fair in many cases. Still, I feel especially sorry for this, apparently super talented and hardworking kid. He can't even be sure that the fees won't rise while he is in college. I really hope he finds his way!<p>*Only requirement: Don't have rich parents, don't save money, don't earn to much with side jobs and fill out tons of paperwork about every aspect of your life.",1302786069

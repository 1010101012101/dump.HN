It seems like a great product with a lots of features, plugins and ways to tweak it. \nBut still KendoUI`s got features like proper grouping, binding to remote data(filtering, sorting, grouping etc), advanced filtering, fast customisation of headers/rows/cells, proper select/multi-select and so on. Im aware that you could probably do all these things with Datatables, but still you would have to find the appropriate plugins, browse through bad documentations and properly end up implementing half of the missing features your self. Of course this could be done, but with KendoUI you got it all out of the box, with proper documentation. And if you don`t figure it out, you got professional support with fast response(great for junior dev). Yes KendoUi got a steep licence cost, but it don`t take long to realize that it`s worth it.  \nI could to exactly the same example for the TreeView component(and to some degree the Data Visualization package, though the open alternatives seems much more competitive, if not better, here).<p>So to answer your question, from my experience using KendoUI reduces the time needed for the average developer to complete the task.",1414011285

With time and money being a finite resource [for most], the commute time comes at the cost of family time and the cost of transportation comes out of their meager earnings (a fact that, if you live in SF or work at a company that provides a private bus, take for granted).  Living outside of the city is still unaffordable for many people because of these costs.<p>The real problem is the scarcity of overall housing resources.  With the boom in tech drawing more and more people into SF, it&#x27;s only going to become more of an issue unless building picks up significantly.  This is also true of salaries, which will have to increase in order for companies to hire people who can afford to live here, further driving a wedge between those who can and those who cannot live here.",1414011190

I&#x27;ve returned to it several times, and I always learn something from what I&#x27;ve missed before.

Few texts in comp-sci can say the same. SICP does a good job of connecting the theory of comp-sci with a real language without overwhelming the student with absurd language syntax problems.<p>When any one asks me to recommend a computer book I recommend SICP.

The concern comes in when you have mental children wielding adult power. Such as voting. Or getting married. Or handling firearms. There&#x27;s also the longer term issue of examining deeper issues, of asking bigger questions, things you don&#x27;t normally get unless you go back to the classics (and no, just because Percy Jackson has Greek gods in it doesn&#x27;t mean it addresses these subjects; that&#x27;s just a setting, a flavor, window dressing).<p>It&#x27;s also compounded by network effects: who wants to read Homer when they will have no one to talk about it with? And after a long day at work, who wants to wade through &quot;War and Peace&quot; when you can sit down with some pulp and escape reality? It&#x27;s hard, but I think the rewards are well worth it, and if we are to keep our freedom (and escape the coddling), we have to at least begin to consider the deeper questions occasionally. Great literature can help, and be a reward in and of itself. YA and children&#x27;s books, usually not so much.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.gq.com/entertainment/movies-and-tv/201102/the-day-the-movies-died-mark-harris?printable=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gq.com/entertainment/movies-and-tv/201102/the-day...</a> - Two apropos quotes from that:<p><i>Adults were treated as adults rather than as overgrown children hell-bent on enshrining their own arrested development.</i><p><i>will grow up believing that movies aimed at adults should be considered a peculiar and antique art.

I would recommend checking out some of his columns and podcasts.<p>Short answer: the game has evolved quite a bit (I&#x27;ve been playing for 17 years).<p>Long answer:<p>> Anybody using the old ones is a sucker.<p>There are several different Constructed formats, each with its own restrictions on which cards can be played. The three most popular are Legacy, Modern, and Standard. In Modern and Standard, only newer cards are allowed, so there naturally aren&#x27;t any from older sets. In Legacy, there are plenty of older cards being played. Take a look at the lists from any Legacy tournament, and you&#x27;ll see a mix of old and new. Now, the power levels of each type of card have changed (in general, creatures have gotten more powerful and non-creature spells less powerful), so you&#x27;ll often see earlier non-creature spells and more recent creatures, but this isn&#x27;t set in stone.<p>There&#x27;s also the idea of power creep. The natural progression of a game like Magic is to allow more and more powerful effects, since not doing so will dis-incentivize buying new cards. For at least the past 10 years, then, Wizards has made a conscious decision to vary the power level between blocks (cycles of sets). Different types of cards will be more or less powerful at different times (in the last block, enchantments were the focus, now multicolor cards are being emphasized).<p>It&#x27;s true that if you want to stay competitive takes a certain amount of money, but this is true in many hobbies. Magic has been constantly getting more popular over the last few years, and it&#x27;s still around when 99% of its competitors are gone. Let&#x27;s check back on your game in 20 years and see where it&#x27;s at.",1414010584

I run AustinUX.org, which is something similar for UX events in Austin, TX, and I&#x27;ve talked with Ross Karchner, who used to run DC Tech Events[1] using his own &quot;eventgrinder&quot; software, as well as other people/groups in similar situations.<p>I really like that it&#x27;s not a &quot;platform,&quot; where I have to have an account or RSVP to you and then separately for the event.  That&#x27;s the last thing an aggregator needs to be.<p>I can offer some advice based on my own research for a future Austin UX redesign.<p>If you&#x27;re just naively accepting various Meetup and Eventbrite organizer feeds, I think you need curation options.  I don&#x27;t add every event that every design-related meetup puts on, for a variety of reasons.<p>Lots of events don&#x27;t have Meetup or Eventbrite listings.  ATXDribbble and Ladies That UX ATX organize primarily on Twitter.  UX Book Club Austin and my old meetup organizes on Facebook.  Being able to link to multiple links for an event is useful.<p>Keep Austin Stylish, a fashion site with a similar calendar for fashion events, and Dance Deets, a dance events site, both have lots of events that don&#x27;t have any online presence at all, they&#x27;re just flyers in boutique windows and club walls.  Being able to have an online URL for events without canonical URLs is useful <i>in these particular cases.</i><p>Showing more information is useful, as well.  In my experience, the priority of information should be:<p>- &quot;Where am I?&quot;<p>- &quot;What&#x27;s going on today&quot;<p>- &quot;Is there an active community here&quot;<p>- &quot;What else should I be paying attention to&quot;<p>- &quot;Where are things this week/month&quot;<p>- Plus being able to just add some things to my calendar without RSVPing<p>- RSVP to things properly (and add them to my calendar)<p>&quot;STARTUP RI&quot; and your newsletter call to action are not the same as saying &quot;Hi, this is an uncurated aggregator for startup and tech events in Rhode Island.&quot;<p>Also, all of RI?  Isn&#x27;t that a whole state?  Will you really drive across the entire state to go to an event?  Geography is important, practical geography, like neighborhoods, areas people work and live, etc.  South Austin, Central Austin, North Austin, East Austin are all different.  You don&#x27;t show enough context to know where things are.  (I&#x27;m not saying a map with pins.)  You also don&#x27;t provide enough context on why I&#x27;d want to attend the event.  &quot;Writing Your Business Plan [in] Providence, RI&quot; tells me nothing about what will be covered, who is hosting, why, etc.  I have to click through all of these links and that&#x27;s not really saving me any time or trouble.  Same for your &quot;Startups&quot; and &quot;Resources&quot; links, ideally I&#x27;m going to become part of these meetups&#x27; communities.  Giving me a list of the ones you track (and why) is useful.<p>You don&#x27;t break up the dates enough.  One of the few things I really like about Plancast is that it breaks up into &quot;Today,&quot; &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; the next few days this week, &quot;Next week,&quot; later this month, next month, etc.  The conditions under which someone can attend an event or not is very individual.  You need to provide as much context as possible.<p>There&#x27;s a list of v2 stuff, too, but that&#x27;s a start.<p>[1]: Offline, here&#x27;s an old IA link that has content: <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110807113142/http://www.dctechevents.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20110807113142/http://www.dctech...</a>",1414009323

Because:<p>a. The number of smartphone users has increased exponentially<p>b. The number in itself cannot be used to ascertain the number of users who owned iOS devices that have switched to other devices or the number of first time smart phone buyers who purchased the device<p>c. Whenever iPhones are compared to other smartphones it is done with a single make/model ex: 194 million iPhone&#x27;s vs 80 million Samsung S4&#x27;s. In the context of this topic, this is a pears to oranges comparison.<p><pre><code>   - A pear to pear comparison would be to compare iOS sales to Android smartphone sales. In which case it would be 194M vs 880M or a ratio of 0.2204545:1 in 2013\n\n   - You can take this a step further and now compare it year over year. i.e. 125M iphones vs 450M android smartphones in 2012. or a ratio of 0.2777777:1\n\n   - Using the previous two statements it could be said that iOS smartphone sales have reduced 21% in comparison to android smatphones year-over-year\n\n   - The comparison above is not too fair either, to take it a step further you should first remove most international sales (by country) and only keep the numbers from select countries. I would use US and Canada (maybe throw in UK). Next remove all phones that were NOT on a 2+ contract (this would level the playing field, and drops the pricing issues to an extent).\n\n   - There are other factors that could also be considered\n</code></pre>\n2.<p><i>The overwhelming majority of people don&#x27;t follow silly patent slapfights and tech news. It just has 0 bearing on their life and how much they like their chosen telephone.</i><p>Touche.<p>Unfortunately, you are discounting one basic (and HUGE) fact, most of this majority rely on the advise of the minority aka the active tech enthusiasts and professionals to help make the buying decisions. This minor group does care about lack of control, patents etc.<p>There are multiple instances of the tech enthusiasts caring enough for making or breaking a product.<p>For example most designers, engineers and tech enthusiasts (myself included) have despised IE, yet among the hundred (more likely thousand) of people I moved over to Opera, Firefox or Chrome (in that order) less than 3 had ever noticed a webpage to be broken and thought it was IE. It was simply a pain in the ass for us, the developers and we made IE burn.<p>There are hundreds of such examples.",1390424143

7105131,comment,7103854,7104729,6,0,klodolph,,,"There are several errors in this comment.<p>1. The CIE XYZ color space is different from the CIE RGB color space.<p>2. &quot;Dynamic range&quot; is not about gamut but the ratio between white and black.  A monochrome display can have high dynamic range.<p>3. Neither the CIE XYZ nor the CIE RGB color space correspond to human vision.  CIE RGB color space uses three monochromatic primaries (700 nm, 546.1 nm, and 435.8 nm) and so there are visible colors that it can&#x27;t represent without using negative numbers (such as the blue color of an Argon laser).  The CIE XYZ space is a linear transformation of the CIE RGB space designed to represent all visible colors without using negative numbers, the trade-off is that most of the colors in XYZ are imaginary -- they cannot be perceived by humans, recorded by cameras, or displayed by monitors.  The color space closest to human perception is CIE LMS, which still contains many imaginary colors.<p>If you want better colors look no farther than Rec 2020, which is probably going to come around soon.  It still won&#x27;t represent Argon-laser-blue but the cost of representing all colors on a real, physical display is prohibitive (to the point that no prototypes even exist).  Agreed that sRGB is a rather small color space but improvements on color representation have to take into account the engineering needed to make it happen.  The question, &quot;Which primaries should I use?&quot; was thoroughly explored during the development of Rec. 2020 and I suggest you read their rationale.",1390422291

Basically, the authors take the well-known SIR model [1] (susceptible -> infectious -> removed) for simple modeling of infectious diseases and modify its removal term to be infectious as well (rather than the infected population just decaying exponentially).<p>The big problem I have with their model is that the population flow is still one-directional, so ANY infection modeled with these equations will eventually go to zero.  There is no term in the equations to account for social adhesion that would prevent people from leaving, and there is no pressure for people who have left Facebook to join again.  The authors have validated their model by curve-fitting it against MySpace&#x27;s decline after the fact, so there&#x27;s no real prediction here.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting model, but take any predictions based on it with a grain of salt.<p>For anyone interested in reading on similar subjects, here&#x27;s a paper I co-wrote in which we incorporate a reinfection term into the SIR model and use it to model viral memes [2,3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X11002824"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X11...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://stash.synchroverge.com/files/viral_memetic_model.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stash.synchroverge.com/files/viral_memetic_model.pdf</a>",1390422198

Influential\npeers pull others in on the climb up—and signal to flee when it’s time\nto get out. “The thing about user adoption and user departure is that\nit’s not a steady flow,” says Boyd. “Think of it as, you’re knitting a\nbeautiful scarf, and you’re knitting and knitting, and you get a\nbigger and bigger scarf.

I still today have barely any idea how to manage a formal proof or what elements are involved in one, because at the time trying to figure out what the hell was going on with this notation and formatting and abbreviations everywhere that I&#x27;d never seen before and trying to make any sense of the weird self-referencing logic of it was unpleasant enough that I just fumbled through the bare minimum to get a passing grade whenever they were involved.",1390421235

No. Are they going to let all the prisoners free en masse who committed MJ-related drug crimes now that it&#x27;s basically legal? Is the drug war really working, or just creating more casualties than necessary?<p>Say a kid is born into a gang family. The gang&#x27;s existence is only possible because drugs are illegal in the US. The kid grows up around violence and drugs, no &#x27;mainstream-style&#x27; support from the parents so there&#x27;s no school or work involved, then ends up in the gang himself. Eventually he goes down on charges. Was his demise systemic? Or is he &quot;just a bad guy&quot; who did something charge-worthy?<p>>No, it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen lots of women drink who I haven&#x27;t subsequently fucked. This is because drinking is not a sexual act. Why do I have to explain this?<p><i>That&#x27;s the point</i>.<p>The fact that posters exist telling <i>you</i> not to get rapey on a woman just because they&#x27;re drinking is why we have to explain this. Drinking is not a sexual act, why are the posters making it one? Not all men are rapists, why are these posters presuming all men are?<p>>The appropriate response isn&#x27;t to say, &quot;Just because you call it rape doesn&#x27;t make it rape.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know whether or not it&#x27;s <i>appropriate</i>, but it logically holds. As does &quot;just because you regret a one-night stand doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not consensual&quot;. It&#x27;s implying a default suspicion of women just as the other posters imply a default suspicion of men. If people don&#x27;t like the tactic, maybe they shouldn&#x27;t use it. Using it in the service of feminism rather than some other ideology doesn&#x27;t magically make it okay.<p>>And even if you were right, that women are taking advantage of a compliant legal system in order to abuse men. Does that actually make it okay to advocate rape in return?<p>Huh? Who&#x27;s advocating rape? Not me, and certainly not those posters...<p>>And that&#x27;s exactly how I feel about the way you treat it<p>Fair enough, I can&#x27;t tell you how to feel. But I&#x27;ve made my share of logical arguments in this thread, and they&#x27;ll stand on their own.<p>>It&#x27;s just that most of the people who claim this, in my experience, have been people who don&#x27;t need advocates and are just relishing another opportunity to slam the door in the face of women<p>There&#x27;s a contingent of women-haters out there for sure, just as there&#x27;s a contingent of man-haters too.

Keep the needs-to-be-fast stuff in C/C++ (hopefully with a well designed API), and code the fun, flexible, interactive stuff in the LFSP of your choice (sorry apparently not all LFSP supported).",1184010188

33310,comment,33246,33246,0,0,marketer,,,"I'd be careful with pure research languages like ocaml. It has some advanced features (polymorphic variants, functors, camlp4, etc. ) that even smart people have a hard time understanding, because they are probably the subject of someone's phd thesis. Also, LFSP's can be quirky: in Ocaml, for instance, native integers are only 31 bits (using 32 bits requires the Int32 module, which requires its own set of operations to use. Don't you love static type checking?)<p>Bugs in LFSP compilers probably appear much more often compared to LFM compilers. ",1184008204

5205229,comment,5200621,5204538,1,0,DannyBee,,,"It's fine to find it condescending, it is in fact, mildly condescending.<p>But it's condescending because of statements like this:
""This is exactly what I'm talking about - what average working person with a family can compete with an army of full time lobbyists whose job it is to meet with congress, take them out for meals, and do whatever else they do to get what they want?""
and 
""And what's wrong with ""complaining about it on an internet forum""? Sometimes it's nice to vent the frustration and hopelessness to people who understand. I certainly do. There's nothing wrong with this. Sometimes complaining is all we CAN do right now.""<p>So let's start with the first one.
I first suggested you write letters, and take an occasional meeting. Lunch is fine. Heck even telephone is fine if you really don't have the time.  Average working people get lunch, and have telephones. They can also write letters.  
So i find your complaint disingenuous.<p>Second, lobbyists are not backed by industries with unlimited wealth.  They aren't magical boogeymen.  This is just another way you are trying to make it seem like there is nothing you can do, so you shouldn't feel bad about complaining instead of doing something.  Most lobbyists are also not full-time on anything.  They are firms, they have a lot of engagements.  Maybe some very small subset is full time on strategy or PR for a few months of a campaign, for some really big client, but past that, nope. It's like paying a lawyer, not paying a personal assistant.  Most tech folks are pretty well off. They could probably afford to buy enough lobbyist time to have your lobbyist take the meetings above if you wanted.   This would be less effective than doing it yourself, and less effective than what I suggested.<p>You then say ""How practical and useful is it for us to flood congress with letters, emails and faxes ""all the time, every time""? I don't think this is a useful strategy at all!""
It is absolutely practical, and absolutely useful.  Congressmen live and die by statistics on what their constituents want, contrary to popular belief. They track letters, faxes, and phone calls on issues from constituents.  They are briefed on issues and constituent viewpoints probably every morning.  If you flooded them all the time, every time, it would make an actual impact.   They care less about lobbyists than direct constituents.
I'll point out that you didn't actually refute my point, just again went into ""throw up my hands and pretend i can't do anything"" mode.<p>As for the second larger point about complaining, there is no hopelessness except the hopelessness you are creating by pretending you can do nothing, and trying to make it seem okay.  It's <i>never</i> the case that all you can do is complain. Never.<p>I already gave you a reasonable action.  You apparently believe your action in giving the EFF a few bucks is truly useful, and ""that's about the best you can do for now"".  So let me ask: Has it stemmed the tide of patents?  Has it won a court case? Gotten a law on patents passed?  Why do you expect this to change if you gave them a few more bucks?<p>Not to belittle the work of the EFF (some of my good friends work there, and they do what they can), but they should be the support. They are also a fairly general digital rights org. When congressmen all jump up and down and say ""oh shit, all my constituents are yelling about patents, what the hell should we be doing?"", that's when the EFF is useful to help.
Besides that, finding or providing cheap legal representation for the guy who is getting screwed, or lending a voice here or there.
Past that, if the EFF had a billion dollars, nothing would change in the current state of the world of patents.
Money for the EFF or lobbyists is not the missing piece of the puzzle here to effect real change.<p>You know, its funny. My job puts me in a position where I can see what the money at least one large tech company spends on lobbyists goes to.  I also get asked to help with these plans from time to time. You know what these lobbyists spend a lot of their time doing? 
Trying to get tech folks to write letters, email, call, or meet with congress people.  That thing you claim isn't effective or practical.  
The last time I asked a high powered, well monied lobbyist what the lowest effort, highest impact thing tech folks could do to win these political fights would be, his answer was simple: ""Show up""<p>FWIW: I am condescending not because I think I am better than you, but because <i>you</i> are better than this.  
Do the simple and practical things.  Do the things you haven't tried before. If you want to complain, I certainly can't stop you, and venting is a wonderful thing to do.  But don't act like you can't do anything, and don't act like doing nothing, helps.",1360644681

This would have been a lot more convincing if any of the example photos were also of metallic looking things that came out and bent at a weird angle. I certainly understand and am familiar with how rocks may contain different materials that erode at different rates, often leaving protrusions.<p>It's not clear to me what sort of material was in the rock that would erode around it to leave such a shape that was found. Perhaps on earth if you had a deposit of metal that melted in volcanic action and then filled a crack or seam in a rock which was in a later age pushed up?<p>This does bring up another point of curiosity - with so little water on the ground, the atmosphere of Mars is likely very dry as well. Would metals oxidize as easily on Mars? Probably not. Perhaps any oxidation that did occur would be little enough to be sand blasted off from the dust storms, leaving exposed metal deposits remaining shiny.",1360643727

Gasoline cars are extremely reliable and incredibly quiet compared to OLDER GASOLINE CARS!  Compared to Afghanistan, Iraq is an incredibly safe and quiet country to visit, but for some reason, I'm not planning a trip there anytime soon.  Gasoline doesn't even come close to winning internal combusion category.  Diesel blows it away in reliability.<p>Gasoline vehicles have gone from being absolute pains in the ass to maintain (I've worked on and rehabbed many an old vehicle, including mid 80's Oldsmobiles, 70's era air cooled VWs, and mid to late 90's GM vehicles) to significantly less pains in the ass, but still finicky creatures.  4 or 5 years in on modern ICE vehicles, you're going to start seeing problems that can often be expensive.  If its not the electrical, it will be failed pump on the cooling system, or even a cracked impeller (now that they are made of plastic).<p>Can you prevent this all with regular maintenance? Of course, but let's not pretend like this isn't much more complicated than it needs to be.  An electric vehicle isn't going to have tubes, pumps, fans, impellers, thermostats, spark plugs, valves,cylinders, ignition coils, injectors, oxygen sensors!!! ($10 part with several hours of labor to replace), catalytic converters... and my god how many other expensive, prone to breaking moving parts can I name.<p>And then you are sitting there talking about turbochargers?  Really??  Do you have any idea what kind of maintenance is required, and oh wait, now we can up our octane to 93, pay out the ass for gasoline, and deal with all the extra wear an tear high compression turbo engines deal with......",1360643455

This is where the ""pick the image with a cute thing"" in it scheme falls down. In this case, once the enumeration of description -> image(s) is determined, you lose.<p>Any scheme that involves humans some how creating tags or labeling images or writing text will generally be enumerable as well, because they can trivially out-manpower you.<p>Also, many CAPTCHA schemes use a model of spammer in which the spammer isn't permitted to be clever. If there is a pattern, in the real world the spammer is ""allowed"" to exploit it. There are 2^64 different ways to add two 32-bit numbers to each other, but that doesn't mean that you can beat a spammer just by asking the user to do a simple addition, because when I say ""enumerate"" I mean it more in the computer science sense, not the literal sense. They can and will create something that parses the problem and does it, so for instance for my stupid ""add two random 32-bit numbers"" example the CAPTCHA is actually <i>easier</i> for a computer than a human.<p>CAPTCHAs are hard and getting steadily harder... at least, if you require them to work.

During this phase, the Mac is sending ARP who-has requests, which are ""anyone out there"" requests, not, ""hey, I'm using this"" requests.<p>2nd phase is the assumption. If the DHCP client in iOS is able to verify the Ethernet and IP address of the DHCP server match it's suspected network profile, and it has a valid DHCP lease record for that network, it assigns that IP to the interface and begins using it, at which point any potential ARP poisoning would occur.<p>3rd phase is DHCP negotiation. The first actual DHCP request goes out at 00.0140s, which is after the initial ARP network profiling, but before the interface actually comes up, so these actions could be considered asynchronous. Once the DHCP negotiation completes, any incorrect assumptions are abandoned and the DHCP issued IP would be used.<p>There appears to be a window of 1.0s where the device is using an assumed IP address. During this time, traffic transmitted on the network would ""poison"" the ARP cache, but IP conflicts are not an end of the world scenario in networking terms. Once the proper DHCP resolution occurs, the ARP table would be updated and the conflict resolved.",1310503659

It might be a violation of network policy though, but that depends on your perspective, not an RFC.<p>Think of it like this. Your iOS device assumes that if it's on the same network, and it has a valid/current DHCP lease, it will use that address while it goes about the business of negotiating a proper DHCP address. The assumption is made outside the scope of negotiating an actual DHCP address.<p>A violation of the protocol would involve tricking the DHCP server or sending false information to the DHCP server. Neither happens here.<p>It's up to the network owner to decide whether or not this is acceptable. With a properly functioning network equipment, you should never encounter a failure of this assumption. If you have an unhealthy network, the assumption may fail more frequently, but then again, you're just compounding an existing issue that should probably be resolved.<p>In the end, we're talking about saving 10s every time you wake your device up.

The most significant of which is the verification of the DHCP server's Ethernet address as correlated to IP.<p>If you are on a known network, your DHCP lease is still active, and network equipment is working as expected, all of these assumptions are safe. The most common failure scenario is where the DHCP server has lost its DHCP lease table. For many consumer routers, this will occur when the router is rebooted. If you have to reboot your router frequently, you should replace it. Even if you do encounter a failure mode, the error will clear a second or two later when a new address is negotiated via DHCP and the subsequent ARP update.<p>This is very clearly a trade-off.

So I think this idea makes a lot of sense.  I wouldn't say they helped me learn anything, but it has helped me to keep from forgetting.<p>It seems like this kind of system has a couple of markets.  I think the reason a lot of Spanish speakers are using it, is because they may already have book learned the basics of English, but lack the day to day interaction.  So that's one segment.  It seems like this site is a sweet spot for them.<p>But another segment probably not as well served would be people who are completely new to a language.  Most language partners won't have the skill to introduce someone who has no background in it.  So I think the uptake for these kinds of language learners would be low.<p>One thing that would be really awesome is to consider integrating some kind of learning curriculum.  But the trick is if you had to supply curriculum for every language, that won't scale well at all.  Instead, consider the barefoot language learning school of thought:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Language-Acquisition-Made-Practical-Learners/dp/0916636003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Language-Acquisition-Made-Practical-Le...</a><p>This book is out of print, but it's an amazing guide to learning any language without a textbook provided you have a language partner.<p>Graphical dictionaries for language learners would also be super helpful:<p><a href=""http://www.lexicarry.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lexicarry.com/</a><p>Also, for more advance learners who are already able to carry out basic conversations, topic suggestions would be super helpful to keep the chat flowing.

This is called a fill, and can last several hours. A fill has several runs, some experiments automatically change runs every hour. A run is generally with a given filter (trigger) setting/detector configuration.
You would run 24/7, but due to the filling cycle, waiting for ramping up and stable beam etc. will give you ""idle"" overhead. Furthermore, you are ""lucky"" to reach flat top stable beam: magnets can quench, power supplies will trip etc. giving unscheduled downtime. Then there is scheduled downtime (like just recently), which can last years :)<p>So all in all, you would get a few dozen weeks of real operations a year, which would include some stable beam (if you aren't into beam gas studies or cosmics).",1310501138

It is only used for physical purchases, stores, gas stations, dinning, etc.<p>The idea is a compromised number is isolated to just one use case.  And the more likely to be compromised use cases impose less pain on us when it happens.<p>So, one obvious question: is there a Credit card company that will just issue multiple #'s allowing this to be on one account?<p>Is there a better method of isolating these categories that we haven't considered, or a better way of dealing with it overall?<p>Finally I expect setting this up will throw all sorts of red flags from the secret algorithms that calculate our credit scores.

Could have explained why that concept won't work rather than just abuse.<p>1. How will you find out people's income? The only way is to let them tell you. The people who report their correct income are the sort who would have bought your DVD at your price anyway. And the people who are the sort to lie to save money would rather get it for free right? There's also the problem of people not wanting to disclose their income to any tom, dick or harry who asks.<p>2. Any sort of price discrimination is generally a bad idea regardless of the basis of discrimination. A better idea is to push the price per unit down to the point where it's a no-brainer to buy it. (I think it was Lady Gaga who sold her latest album for a buck per copy and generated huge sales volume)<p>Besides, we don't need some newfangled solution that is so hard to implement. The problem is that the people who produce content like music/movies have gotten into a rut in the way they think. We need a Steam (the software by valve) for movies. Just buy a movie and you own it forever. Lost a hard disk and want to watch The Godfather again? Just login and re-download a h264 rip LEGALLY. Have a blue ray player and a fast internet connection?

3551437,comment,3551103,3551103,6,0,zach,,,"If the point is that there are no residual payments[1] for individual game creators, this list is ridiculously short.  Practically all games ever on a shelf are in that category, where the individuals worked for hire with only the hope of short-term bonuses or profit-sharing for successful games.<p>Instead, this list seems to say that sometimes the corporate entities who developed the game, and their shareholders, sometimes aren't getting money anymore for whatever possible success the games get.  This doesn't seem to be riddled with moral complexities as much as business complexity.  But I know this is an ""abandonware"" [2] apologia and so I'm not expecting this to be totally serious.<p>I think individual residual payments are a much more provocative idea.  I've programmed on games on and off this list, and when I was younger I acted in a few TV shows.  I've gotten a couple dollars (literally[3]) in residuals from the Screen Actors Guild, which is 100% more than for my work on games after leaving the developer.  So hmm, what can I say about this?<p>First, the economics don't make sense for it right now.  Games are like movies in the pre-TV era, where they earn 90% of all the money they will ever earn in the 12 months after their release.  But I recognize that with emulation that is becoming somewhat less true.<p>Second, the project structure doesn't support this.  This was actually easier to do in the studio system when you had more free agency, movies banked heavily on their highly-visible actors and movies took a few months to film at most.  Major game projects require more creators than ever and are now longer than ever, so only a few creators have individual influence over the finished product.  So game developers are not in a strong position to get them.<p>Finally, you can make an argument that a game is an work that encapsulates a performance of its creators.  This is a rational basis for residual payments, because it's very comparable to acting.  This is a promising angle to argue, but still, this is a very unrealistic possibility.

3551426,comment,3551350,3551350,2,0,gatlin,,,"I would add the following.<p>Just think of the word function for a moment, in an algebraic context. A function is a a relation (ie, a mapping from a set of things to another set of things) where each element of the domain maps to at most one element of the range. Now, the inverse does not hold: any given output might have several inputs that lead to it.<p>For example, f(x) = x^2 is a function because f(2) is always 4, no matter what end of story. f(-2) is also always 4, and that's okay.<p>In most languages where you use ""functions"" you can modify state as part of the function doing its thing. Modifying external state opens up the possibility that, if we are writing a function `func`, `func(A)` might somethings return B or sometimes return C. That violates the definition of a function.<p>This could happen if our `func` example mutates a variable that it relies on, alters a database, etc. If that variable, or that database, is used elsewhere in the program, you open the door for non-determinism. In other words, bringing in external state could very well mean that your function isn't a function at all, in a mathematical sense.<p>Sticking with mathematical functions means that your program is more deterministic. It means you can reason about the correctness of your program more easily. It means that you can write a series of reusable components which can be composed any which way without too much trouble, and thus refactoring and creating libraries is much easier.<p>Only at the ""edge"" of your program, where it absolutely must mutate the outside world in some way, should you violate this.",1328375434

In these economies children are your pension fund.  There's no RRSP funds or old age security payments.  Just children who (hopefully) look after you in your old age.  If you have only one or two you will either be an unreasonable burden upon them or simply be abandoned to starve.<p>The economic support system for seniors in the developed world is currently under a lot of strain too.  In countries where pension funds are funded from current taxes the baby-boomer retirement is going to be a tremendous drain on society.  The baby-boomer generation <i>should</i> have tucked away a nice huge fund to pay them in retirement as well as support the greater demand on the medical system.  Instead, they racked up huge amounts of public debt. Massive amounts of immigration and raising the retirement age have been the stop-gap measure of choice so far, but the developed world's support for senior citizens could easily revert to that of the developing world's without much warning!<p>So, yes, children are expensive, but for most of history and in large parts of the world today they are a necessary investment for retirement.

The more you aspire to excellence, the harder it can become if you let it. And you should aspire. You're never good enough.<p>Here are a few things that may help from my experience.<p>1) Relax and enjoy it.\n2) Separate the creative process from the editing process. That is, on first-draft just let it flow. Write anything and everything that comes to mind. Don't worry about vocabulary, spelling, grammar, political correctness, offending your dog. Just get it out. Put on your editor's hat only after you've sputtered out. Then go back, rewrite, and edit. Fine writing is REWRITING. Sometimes many passes; many drafts.\n3) Keep a notebook. When your mind tickles you with a phrase about anything, write it down. Your subconscious mind is your best friend. But it's shy, easily offended. Censor yourself and it'll shut down. Invite it in and it'll serve you with ideas, images, and language of startling beauty and relevance. It'll also deceive you into believing that something it delivers is better than it is. But you can deal with this during the editing/rewriting phase.\n4) Give yourself permission to write. And to publish. Keep in mind that you can't please everyone with your writing. No matter how fine a writer you are, some readers will reject you for uncounted reasons. Your goal as a writer is to minimize the number of readers who do so.\n5) Writing is simply another way of talking. You talk naturally. If you relax, you'll learn to write naturally. To write well you do need to learn and absorb the basics of spelling, grammar, logic, formatting conventions, etc., etc. These technicalities should be internalized like muscle memory. But don't worry about that crap while writing the first draft. Just get it out.<p>Hope this helps.<p>LRP",1328374861

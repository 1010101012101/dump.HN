Again, we can use an approach similar to Bitcoin (and to Hashcash): If you want to store your registration in a block you need to ""pay"" for this with some CPU power. So if you want to register a given domain you need to calculate SHA-256(domainname + data), where data is chosen in a way that the first X bits of the resulting hash are zero. So basically you need to use a brute-force mechanism to find appropriate data. If it, e.g., takes on average 1 week to find this data, this is acceptable for an individual who wants to register a domain, but (hopefully) too expensive for a squatter.<p>However one problem with this approach is that there's no incentive for someone to participate in the block generation. In bitcoin participation gives you Bitcoins which have a real monetary value. But I think creating some incentive shouldn't be too hard. E.g., it should be possible to couple the block chain to Bitcoin, so that generating blocks for the secure domain system also gives you Bitcoins (as a side effect).",1291149468

This can lead to unstable systems that nobody understands.<p>The key question: when new requirements (an inevitability) force you to re-engineer a key element of your system (an inevitability) will you have to perform more ""experiments"" to figure out which random mutations of your previous design yield the desired results or will you be able to mostly plan ahead of time how to change your design to have the desired characteristics?<p>If it's the former then you may be faced with the prospect of a change of requirements that you are incapable of coping with, causing your business plan to die. Many software companies have met that fate.",1291148366

This works really well for things like restaurants where there is no network effect, no incentives for new users to go with well-established providers or disincentives for existing users to switch providers.<p>In the social/dating/craigslist space, you don't just need to build a better X, you need to convince people to leave the old X (or pray that they've never heard of the old X before and won't consider it) and sign up for your new X.<p>In terms of dating, social and craigslist at least you're only dealing with one type of customer. As soon as you turn to local events/businesses you needs to do this for two (the people looking for events and businesses, and the promoters and business owners).<p>Cable networks are similar businesses, but I think the key distinction is that they charged money for their services. Somewhat paradoxically, I think this makes it much easier for people to switch than if all the services are free - there is the immediate incentive of ""save $10 a month!""<p>I think this is why AOL and Prodigy managed to make so much money. Then all the free (ad-supported) online services came along and basically wiped out the paid services, and intensified the network effect and its disincentive for switching to better services.",1291148250

This indicates that the people doing them usually don't have the level of thoughtfulness that's needed to succeed. And while it's certainly possible to listen to your fans and make changes as you go, it's too hard to succeed this way against an already entrenched competitor unless you have at least a little bit of an ideological advantage compared to the existing platform.

Stay away from people who have only done branding, they will eat your money.\nAlso, I know you're looking for a hacker, but I think the most important factor in running internet marketing campaigns is knowing how to sell. Identifying your target market and what their pain points, wants, and desires are is paramount. Optimizing, split testing, etc is important but secondary compared to marketing fundamentals.\nFinally, watch out for ""social media experts"". Value applicants based on how many conversions they can bring, and how much they can spend effectively, not on how much they can engage in conversations. Until you can pay your vendors in Twitter followers, all that matters is getting quality traffic and sales.</i><p>I think the fundamental issue is that you're framing this as a job for hackers.

No, it&#x27;s merely acknowledging the fact of their state of technology. And it should be noted, primitive in this sense exists on constantly shifting sand: Americans from 1776 were primitive as well. Saying so is not racist.<p>By our standards today, George Washington was killed by medical malpractice, having been bled to death.

5993274,comment,5991576,5991576,6,0,bryanchen,,,"Okay, this is kind of off-topic to the main gist of the article, but I&#x27;m a Singaporean living in Singapore, and I believe that the article is rather mischievous (or the author genuinely does not know/bother to know the facts).<p>First of all, there is no such thing as a requirement for a blogging licence. I can blog, my friends can blog - and we all don&#x27;t have to get a blogging licence. It is irresponsible, given that the author claims to have &quot;read an article&quot;, that he decided to summarise it in two words - a &quot;blogging license&quot;. This shows that either he doesn&#x27;t understand it, or he is deliberately trying to mislead people.<p>Next, I&#x27;m tired of people saying that free speech is limited in Singapore. It is not. There are rules in place to prevent over-zealous extremists (of any kind or nature). I urge anyone who feels otherwise to take a look at Singapore&#x27;s short national history - about mass inter-racial riots that caused massive turmoil in the country. This is why the laws have been enacted. These laws simply say that we aren&#x27;t allowed to publicly denounce another religion, or another race. And before you start jumping up and down saying &quot;that&#x27;s limiting my freedom to speak!&quot;, let me clarify. It&#x27;s not what you think. It&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t complain or even speak badly about someone else&#x27;s race or religion in public. I can. But the moment I start shouting these insults, that&#x27;s when the authorities would take action against me. It&#x27;s only civilised, and the government has formalised this civility. On one hand, people ignorant to historical events in Singapore can simply surmise that they are tools by the government to inhibit freedom of speech. On the other hand, however, and this is what I personally feel, these laws exist to keep the peace. Think about it. Singapore is a small island filled with people of different races and religions. Yet we don&#x27;t have religious wars and we certainly don&#x27;t have racial riots.<p>And finally, the claim of, &quot;I suspect at some point the Singapore intelligence agency may have hacked into my email while I was there (another IP was registering on my Gmail account). Also I believe I was interviewed by a Singaporean spy.&quot; I seriously doubt it. Do you really think that if a highly trained spy wanted to covertly interview you, a technical writer and web developer, that you would know? And if they did want you to know, you <i>would</i> have known that you&#x27;re being interviewed. I doubt (and here I&#x27;m assuming) that spending hours reading conspiracy theories online would make one an expert in counter-intelligence. Again, like what I said, this ill-constructed idea that the author has is probably due to the lack of understanding of the so-called &quot;blogging license&quot;. And again, I repeat: one DOES NOT require a licence to blog.<p>Over the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve seen an increase in the number of people (mostly foreigners) writing articles about Singapore, saying that citizens&#x27; liberties are curtailed and limited. Again, as a citizen, this isn&#x27;t true. Just like how Americans value their &quot;freedoms&quot;, sometimes till the point of absurdity (absurd at least to foreigners like myself, and with regards to &quot;the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun&quot;), we Singaporeans value the peace and harmony within our tiny island-state. We put this, sometimes, even above our own personal liberty - like the freedom to shout racist remarks in a coffeeshop. Is that wrong? Only someone who has seen the bloody effects of racial and religious unrest would be qualified to answer the question.",1372992916

That&#x27;s just about enough to supply yourself with an adequate amount of food, clothing, and similar basic necessities if you are in some low-rent area - in short, for a single person to keep body and soul together. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> enough to go out to restaurants or purchase more than necessities unless you enjoy some sort of additional subsidy from parents, spouse or wherever. You&#x27;ll be cooking your own meals, carting your groceries around on foot, doing the same with your laundry (or washing it in the bathtub) because you can&#x27;t afford a washing machine, and so on and so forth. You won&#x27;t starve, but you&#x27;ll have to work at things that other people pay to have done for them. This is, believe it or not, time-consuming, and effort-consuming too. It&#x27;s not too bad for a single individual who&#x27;s educated enough to have a meaningful inner life, but for a lot of people it means both boredom and a significant exclusion from social activity, and for an awful lot of other people (the sort you think chose to have vaginal sex instead of giving you a blowjob), it can mean dealing with children, which is extremely time-consuming.<p>I think you mean well Chris, but you seem almost comically ignorant about the difficulties faced by other people who didn&#x27;t have the good fortune to be you.",1372992663

By the very nature of being information which is classified or higher, in order for details of actual usage to be outlined on Wikipedia, an editor with access to that classified information would need to break federal law and put Wikipedia in a position of question legality.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s not a fact that PRISM data is only used against a person when there is a warrant, but it is to say that <i>we don&#x27;t know that that is the case</i>.<p>Second, no reasonable person with a decent understanding of this issue is claiming that the NSA isn&#x27;t legally justifying their actions. Indeed, the NSA is using--as expected--national security in part as a motivating legal justification, and invoking Article IV Section 4. It is agreed: national security is their intelligence directive.<p>Nor are such people claiming that the government hasn&#x27;t previously used secret surveillance programs, or that the government is necessarily intentionally tyrannical.<p>What we are saying is that legal justification aside, we want the details of this directive in the public conversation so that We the People can decide if we approve of the actions. We the People are the governors of this country, and We the People have the power to change the laws or the Constitution if we decide that the actions are not justifiable, are not reconcilable with liberty, or if the system of checks and balances have failed to check or balance.<p>This is a dangerous situation. If Snowden&#x27;s claims are correct, not only are we being overbearingly surveilled, but that data is dangerously aggregated. Even if we are to assume complete benevolence and complete competence in our government (even government actors who may be under-paid and under-invested in their duties), then there is still a very real possibility that people who would seek destruction could acquire possession of that data, gaining a catastrophic trove of information about not just the American public--who would probably be protected by the overbearing force of the U.S. Military--but also the public of the rest of the world.<p>In conclusion, it seems to me that <i>we</i> can&#x27;t know that PRISM or associated programs are necessary and justified government functions, because <i>we</i> know nothing about them. Of the 300,000,000+ people in the United States, 435 are in a position of both knowledge and decision on those policies, and given the importance of this issue that&#x27;s just not good enough.<p>Especially when it is undisputed that those 435 people can&#x27;t do their job even minimally effectively.",1372991103

Say, the economy as a whole is about $15 trillion/year (it&#x27;s a bit higher, but I&#x27;m approximating), so at most you&#x27;d be looking at inflation of 16.6%. You&#x27;re assuming that the first $10,000 of goods and services would be inflated by 100%, but this isn&#x27;t true, nor is the first $10k of goods and services the same for everyone.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m giving you a very abridged answer, but I encourage you to look into Milton Friedman&#x27;s writings on the concept of Basic Income - not a person you could accuse of economic illiteracy, even if you didn&#x27;t agree with all or many of his views.",1372990635

It&#x27;s been going strong with a new iteration based on Qt 5, the project just released Frameworks 5.8 which support compilation against Qt 5.5.<p>In addition to Frameworks 5, the KDE project is porting their applications to Qt 5 while adding security fixes, usability improvements and new features.<p>The KDE project has a full-featured mail client, including smart OpenPGP integration, an IDE, a modern XMPP client with OTR integration and a pretty wonderful general document viewer.<p>There are people who don&#x27;t like KDE for whatever reason, but it is far from dead.<p>On a related note: I&#x27;ve interacted with several KDE developers when submitting bug reports over the years and I have found them to be really nice, responsive and respectful overall.<p>[Edited: added valid to first paragraph]",1426341564

It addresses the issues we all seem to have with this article better than I could.<p><i>Generation X (and even more so generation Y) are cultures of immediate gratification. I’ve worked with a staggering number of engineers that expect the “career path” to take them to the highest ranks of the engineering group inside 5 years just because they are smart. This is simply impossible in the staggering numbers I’ve witnessed. Not everyone can be senior. If, after five years, you are senior, are you at the peak of your game? After five more years will you not have accrued more invaluable experience? What then? “Super engineer”? Five more years? “Super-duper engineer.” I blame the youth of our discipline for this affliction.</i><p><a href=""http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engi...</a>",1426341311

9202608,comment,9194889,9201064,0,0,seykron,,,"The platform is not for the whole electorate because we are no longer trying to participate in elections (it is explained in the journal article), we are now a non-electoral political organization. There is a lot of literature[1][2][3] and a bunch of experiences[4] related to the implementation of high-scale direct democracy, but looking at the argentinian politics it is a very far horizon at the moment.<p>Despite of that, we&#x27;re not that special. There are a lot of organizations (social movements, collectives, local assemblies) all around the world that do organize by using some kind of direct democracy strategy. But we want to bring direct democracy to institutional areas at some level[5]. In order to reach that purpose we&#x27;ve got three main values: direct democracy to take decisions, transparency as the social contract, and free culture as the foundation of our values and principles. Based on these values, we&#x27;re focused in organizing actions related to the political space.<p>Regarding direct democracy, we take decisions based on a consensus process rather than voting. This changes the people&#x27;s mindset and promotes participation instead of competition, it breaks hierarchies and distributes the power among all members. We have not a &quot;board&quot;, we have a process to take decisions that we call &quot;dissensus-based process&quot;. We consider that consensus is a permanent status, and dissensus is the lack of consensus. So in order to take a decision there&#x27;s a very simple constraint: the three pirates rule. If three persons want to organize an action, they just do it unless someone says &quot;I DO NOT AGREE&quot;, so it must be discussed until there is consensus again.<p>Regarding transparency, we have our own infrastructure and we adopt tools that helps with transparency: mailing lists, wikis, git, loomio, etc. There&#x27;re are not &quot;private activities&quot;, everything we do is public or &quot;semi-public&quot; (post-facto) when it is quite critical.<p>Of course, it has several issues. It is a challenge to make the organization grow because it depends on people that think based on quite similar values. We&#x27;ve got a set of principles[6] and political guidelines[7] to appeal when there is dissensus.<p>I hope you now could figure out yourself how different we are from other political parties.<p>[1] Aaron Swarz - Parpolity or the power of exponents: <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/parpolity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/parpolity</a>\n[2] A classic: The Principle of Federation - Proudhon: <a href=""http://www.ditext.com/proudhon/federation/federation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ditext.com/proudhon/federation/federation.html</a>\n[3] The new anarchists - David Graeber: <a href=""http://newleftreview.org/II/13/david-graeber-the-new-anarchists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newleftreview.org/II/13/david-graeber-the-new-anarchi...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.david-kilgour.com/mp/democracy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.david-kilgour.com/mp/democracy.htm</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_insertion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_insertion</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://wiki.partidopirata.com.ar/Declaraci%C3%B3n_de_Principios_Partido_Pirata_Argentino"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.partidopirata.com.ar/Declaraci%C3%B3n_de_Princip...</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://wiki.partidopirata.com.ar/Bases_de_Acci%C3%B3n_Pol%C3%ADtica"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.partidopirata.com.ar/Bases_de_Acci%C3%B3n_Pol%C3...</a>",1426341186

An intermediate developer is one who can get everything done without assistance (although they may still benefit from assistance!).  A senior developer is someone who can bring up everybody else&#x27;s level -- getting assistance in this seems to be a critical prerequisite for success).<p>I tell this to people on my team, but again it is hard to judge your own effectiveness.  There is a lot of hubris.  I know -- been there, done that, slept in the t-shirt for over 20 years.  Thinking about it, I think the key piece of experience that can help you be a good senior developer is to watch a system that you built collapse under its own weight.

Something has to render the content, as with most programs everything is a CPU vs Memory vs IO/Network trade off. It&#x27;s nice to now have the option to use the CPU of the client if desired.<p>I started programming in the heavy client days, writing VB6 against Access databases or SQL server. This is how your typical business app was made and it completely consumed the mainframe/terminal model because you could scale on commodity hardware taking heavy advantage of the now relatively powerful distributed client resources. The server did as little as possible to get the data to the client for rendering/presentation also you could do offline partially connected things. Of course there where issues with this model, deployment was much harder and you had to trust the clients, plus databases generally didn&#x27;t scale out at the time.<p>Then browsers came about, and everyone realized you could write business apps in them, but the old guys laughed at us because it was the dumb terminal model all over again. All validation done on the server, no deployment issues, no need to trust the client, network connection always required. Then javascript started getting better, hey I can do validation in the client again, but maybe do on the server still if you don&#x27;t trust the client, but the user gets instant feedback, best of both worlds.<p>The choice about which layer your code executes in is important, it lets you make that CPU vs Memory vs IO trade off without leaving the client CPU on the table.

They know it isn&#x27;t as fast as it could be (since they don&#x27;t have decades of compiler optimizations yet that GCC or other compilers would give).  As well, it&#x27;s just a newer language.  One thing a lot of people don&#x27;t always realize is Golang started with the Plan9 C compiler[0].  So they actually generate all the way from source to machine code with their own compiler toolchain (no LLVM, GCC, or other compiler required).<p>When you look at the people coming to Go, most are coming from Python or Ruby, not C, C++, or Java.  So a lot of the experience Go developers have are those other languages.  As Rob Pike pointed out 2 years ago[1], while they set out for Go to replace C++, it ended up actually being a much better fit for Python and Ruby developers.<p>[0] <a href=""http://adventgo.blogspot.ca/2014/05/origin-of-go-toolchain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adventgo.blogspot.ca/2014/05/origin-of-go-toolchain.h...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentia...</a>",1400165957

Perhaps it&#x27;s my jaded brand of libertarianism showing:  I&#x27;m inclined to say that media companies have just as much a right to make it hard for me to give them money as I have a right to continue not giving them money.

I expect that the traits of frameworks you describe to be features of particular frameworks and to be largely independent of language, except that in languages that don&#x27;t provide introspection/metaprogramming facilities that enable them, you probably won&#x27;t find them (probably, because usually there may be elaborate ways of hacking around language limitations to do magic, and then even examining the source code will make the magic less obvious.)<p>You can easily have magic-free frameworks in Ruby or Python, and easily heavy-magic frameworks in most (mostly) statically-typed compiled languages like C# and friends as long as they have some introspection/metaprogramming facilities (and optional dynamic typing like C# makes this more viable, too.)<p>If you want to choose a language so as to avoid any need to examine the traits of particular frameworks so that you don&#x27;t run into a heavy-magic one, you are going to need a much more limited language than C#.<p>> What&#x27;s the point of using a compiled language if half your code is a dynamic viewbag of string keys and liberal JSON parsers that just ignore fields it doesn&#x27;t expect or can&#x27;t fill?<p>The point is the other half of the code. (The part that, in Python or Ruby you might be tempted to drop down to a C or Java [for JRuby] extension to do.)",1400165491

7749618,comment,7749340,7749456,5,0,jerf,,,"To explain to those who may not know what&#x27;s going on here:<p>Go forbids importing modules that you then don&#x27;t use in the source code. This is particularly annoying with the &quot;fmt&quot; module, which contains things like Printf that are useful for debugging, but you may only be using fmt.Printf for one debugging statement in the code. Consequently, if you&#x27;re developing, and you&#x27;re adding and removing it over and over you also have to add and remove it to and from your import list over and over, which is very annoying since it&#x27;s likely to be relatively distant from your use location, and it&#x27;s mandatory that all imports are listed at the top of the file. (So, you can&#x27;t do what you can do in perl and say &quot;use Data::Dumper; print Dumper($debugging_stuff);&quot; all on one line, without even being concerned about whether Dumper may already be imported.)<p>goimports is a source filter that cleans out any unused modules, and tries its best to add modules that you only reference. It&#x27;s pretty good. You can confuse it if you have two modules with the same last bit of the name, but the standard library doesn&#x27;t have that anyhow, and for the most part you can deal with that. Since it also runs gofmt for you on save, it&#x27;s also a drop-in replacement for gofmt, which you should configure your editor to run on every save even if you for some reason don&#x27;t want the goimports functionality. (Seriously. Just do it. There&#x27;s no excuse not to. There&#x27;s no excuse to ever commit code that was not gofmt&#x27;ed.)<p>If you do that, the problem goes away. Typing &quot;fmt.Printf&quot; pulls fmt in automatically, removing the one line removes it automatically, the import list is always accurate, and it&#x27;s smart enough that if it isn&#x27;t the only usage it doesn&#x27;t remove it.<p>That said, I also strongly recommend setting up automatic syntax checking by compilation (flymake in emacs, don&#x27;t know what in vim, etc), so that you also avoid the &quot;Save -> switch windows to terminal -> compile -> get smacked in face with an error that feels stupidly persnickety&quot; psychological torture. If the errors highlight in your editor on save or something, you go through that much less. Those who lived in the C#/Java etc world have long had this... a lot of people coming from the scripting side would be advised to pick up a bit more of the helpful tools the static side has to offer.",1400164410

(The NaN may be coming in from a data file | over the wire | from another process prepared under an entirely separate floating-point environment that didn’t have traps enabled).<p>> Can you give an example where == is appropriate, but where you want NaN == NaN to be false?<p>I’ll give you one where == is appropriate but where you want -0 == +0:<p><pre><code>    if (x == 0) return someFormulaValidAtZero(x);\n    else return somethingEasierToComputeWithAnImplicitFactorOfx(x)/x;\n</code></pre>\nthis is actually a fairly common idiom.<p>Here’s my standard question for the “NaN should equal NaN&quot; crowd, to which I’ve never seen a satisfactory response: If NaN == NaN, how should NaN compare against zero?  I think we all agree that NaN != 0.  If NaN < 0 or NaN > 0, you’re giving up x > y ==> -x < -y, which to my mind is a bigger loss than trichotomy.  If NaN ?? 0, then trichotomy goes out the window, and presumably NaN ?? (any number), at which point NaN is unordered with respect to every number, but somehow equal to itself, which is also pretty darn weird.<p>You give something up any way you tackle this.  You may reasonably argue that one of these options is less bad than another, but you can’t pretend that there’s a canonical right approach (though nearly every algebraist I’ve ever met believes that you should be able to until they really dig into it; analysts are much more realistic).<p>w.r.t. rounding modes, I partially agree.  Had I been on the committee in 1985, I would have argued against formalizing round up and round down (round to zero is quite useful for some signal-processing applications).  It’s a mistake to look at them and say “they aren’t interval arithmetic so they’re useless”, however.  They were never intended to be interval arithmetic; rather they were intended to be building-blocks for interval arithmetic systems.  (My problems with them are that (a) they’re global rather than operation-by-operation—this was corrected in the 2008 IEEE-754 document and (b) round-up and round-down are no more useful building blocks than round-to-zero (which we already have) and round-away-from-zero, which would free up space for another useful rounding mode (either round-ties-away “schoolbook rounding”) or round-to-odd, which is extremely useful for library implementors).",1400164093

That means you will continue to get crappy results on all your other browsers and devices.<p>* It modifies the links after you load the page so you see them disappear which can be disorienting. I really don&#x27;t want those search results even making it into the DOM.<p>* As of now I&#x27;m not able to even edit my list (the options menu item is grayed out) and I have no idea why. The quality of the extension is poor at best.<p>* It has zero intelligence. What would be ideal is that I could subscribe to a blocklist of well known content farms and allow crowdsourcing to maintain and add to that list.<p>The clear message from Google is that it doesn&#x27;t really want to support or encourage wholesale blocking of any domains. Google would prefer to be the entity that makes that decision for you, and since these content farms make Google a lot of money don&#x27;t hold your breath that they&#x27;re going to start cracking down in a serious way anytime soon.",1400163651

On the other hand, it&#x27;s a bit double-edged.<p>As I am the parent with the CS degree, my wife is already referring our second-grader to me for help with math homework. Sure, after calc I-III, diff-EQ, linear algebra, etc. I can readily pick up on what they are doing and why. I also absolutely agree that they need to go beyond rote-memorization and help kids with a fundamental understanding of numbers, their relationships, etc.<p>But, here&#x27;s the other side: I don&#x27;t know that, say, a first or second-grader is really ready to grasp some of the concepts (at least as they are currently being taught). My daughter &quot;handles&quot; it pretty well and can get the job done, but it sometimes seems that they are simply moving the rote-memorization ball, so to speak. That is, now, instead of just remembering tables, she may be simply remembering these new methods of arriving at the answer. I&#x27;m not sure she really knows why though. And, it can actually be kind of difficult to test where their level of true understanding is. For instance, asking them to explain gets into their verbal skills as much as math. So, they may actually understand it, but are unable to really explain it. One clue is the kind of mistakes they make, but it&#x27;s still kind of murky.<p>In any case, in the end, I&#x27;m not altogether sure that her comprehension has been expanded. And, it sometimes seems that the result is that she simply has to labor harder to arrive at the same answers.<p>On a side note, what&#x27;s funny is that I learned the &quot;old-school&quot; way, yet I somehow managed to comprehend and am now trying to help my daughter understand the &quot;new school&quot; way.

It was a very clever play by a search engine company.<p>What intrigues me about the Android-equation and the way it entered Googles&#x27; playbook is that, indeed, the game is not over.  Any other young upstart can arise, almost immediately, and challenge the hegemony .. all you have to do is be willing to commit to a real platform strategy.<p>I believe the Android vs. iOS challenge for the mainstream is a very vibrant industrial action; echoes of this gameplay can be definitely observed, elsewhere in the F/OSS eco-system.  A fundamental difference between iOS/Android: one is closed, the other is open.  A new, open challenge to Android could indeed eat its lunch, if the open challenge were won in such a way that it would attract the hunger-economy of the giants.<p>I personally would like to just have a phone that is 100% open source.  I&#x27;ve had both Android/iOS in my life, equally, since inception, and ultimately I find the industrial-baggage load to be pretty high.  In the new NSA era, what the hell is the point of trying to hide anything any more .. the new cool is completely open.<p>I bet it would solve the immense-cruft problem we can easily witness in heft with iOS/Android, as both platforms NIH/NIMBY their way across the &#x27;developer mind-control&#x27; table.<p>Imagine this: someone builds a challenger OS, for free, that runs on everyones&#x27; phone, regardless of manufacturer-lockout/lockin.

If you&#x27;re in a corporate setting and the majority of your users are in the same time zone as your servers, then it makes sense to use that time zone.

Have them send me the results, an explanation of the results, and an analysis of the requirements. (fundamental skills that anyone who wants to get an onsite interview has to have).<p>So if you&#x27;re an engineer and the recruiter asks if you&#x27;d be willing to do this exercise to see if the job is a good fit, are you ok with that? angry? curious?",1375916198

See, for example, this part of Virginia&#x27;s fraud law:<p><a href=""http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-178</a><p>Note that merely obtaining a <i>signature</i> under false pretenses is a crime. Of course, the definition of &quot;false pretenses&quot; is the sticking point. Technically, the customer did not make any false representations. It seems he merely expected the bank not to notice his &quot;proposed&quot; contractual changes. That would not seem to satisfy the elements of the crime, though I wouldn&#x27;t bet my own freedom on that.<p>Regarding bad faith: It would be interesting to see if the court would find a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It&#x27;s iffy. Generally, such a breach would arise from either party&#x27;s conduct <i>outside</i> the signing of the contract itself. I.e. you do something underhanded to thwart the other party&#x27;s enjoyment of his contractual rights, without breaching any specific term in the contract.<p>Could a breach of the implied covenant arise from the negotiation process itself? In my cursory search, I didn&#x27;t come across any cases like that, but they could exist. In this case, there does seem to be some willful deception on the customer&#x27;s part. One could argue, based on the circumstances, that he expected the bank not to notice his alterations. Perhaps this would be considered bad faith.<p>One could also argue that the contract is void as there was no meeting of the minds. This can be a difficult case to make when there is a written contract. Nonetheless, in unusual circumstances, which this appears to be, a written contract can be voided for this reason. Here, one could argue that the two parties thought they were signing contracts containing radically different text, and thus there was no meeting of the minds.<p>Note that you can&#x27;t just claim this any time you want to get out of a written contract. The default assumption is that your signature indicates you read and understood the contract. You have to show some unusual circumstance--such as one party&#x27;s surreptitious alteration prior to signing--if you want to claim there was no meeting of the minds. And even then, a win is far from guaranteed.",1375915881

If you overbet, your expected growth rate is negative... because over the long run, by the time you hit the jackpot you&#x27;ve lost too much of your stack to get back to even.<p>Basically, I think Kelly says you can&#x27;t just go by expected value, ie your edge, you have to look at your stack. Overbetting turns a +EV bet into a -EV bet and eventual loss of your whole stack.<p>So 1) I don&#x27;t think Kelly is a product of log utility, it just requires that you are trying to maximize your growth rate (As an aside, in many settings people are much more risk averse than log utility implies; and in many settings people don&#x27;t have consistent cardinal utility, a time-inconsistent utility like prospect theory is more predictive) and 2) since you are presented with interesting bets every day, if not this particular one, Kelly generally applies, since if you don&#x27;t heed it you fall victim to gambler&#x27;s curse.",1375915589

6176091,comment,6173757,6175493,43,0,ANTSANTS,,,"Here&#x27;s a hopefully illustrative example of a special purpose memory manager: The naive bitmap<p>Take a fixed-size pool of memory and divide it into a fixed number of equally-sized regions. Say, if your game&#x27;s entities take up a maximum of 32 bytes of memory each, and you are ok with imposing a hard limit of 256 entities in the world at once, you could allocate an 8 kilobyte memory buffer and manage it yourself. Already there are apparent benefits in this scheme in reducing memory fragmentation (all of the game entities are in this 8 kilobyte region, and not scattered all throughout memory) and thus cache coherency (it&#x27;s quicker to sequentially access memory in a small region of memory than it is to &quot;hop around&quot; all over the place).<p>How might we manage this memory? We really just need a way of allocating regions (&quot;I want to create a new entity, please give me a free region to store it in&quot;) and freeing them when we&#x27;re done with them (enemy died or whatnot). Because we have a fixed number of fixed-size regions, it&#x27;s very straightforward (well under a 100 lines of C) to use a bitmap for doing so. Well, bitmap is the common terminology for this data structure, but I prefer to think of it as a binary set: you have a bunch of bits in RAM, and a 1 bit at some integer index indicates that the index is in the set, and a 0 bit indicates that it isn&#x27;t. For example, if you have the byte 00010011, then 0, 1, and 4 would be in the set, while 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 would not. [EDIT] Er, I guess &quot;set of integers under some limit&quot; is a more accurate description, but I like the way that &quot;binary set&quot; sounds.<p>So, dividing the 256 regions of the example by 32 bits in an x86 machine word, you would need 8 machine words to store this binary set, which take up 32 bytes total. All we need to keep track of is whether or not each region is free, so it&#x27;s a suitable data structure for this purpose.<p>Most modern machine architectures have instructions for finding the index of the first set (1) bit in a machine word in a single, very quick operation.[1] So, we can use that to our advantage by representing a free region as a set bit, and an allocated region as a clear bit. Then, when you need to allocate a new entity, we can very quickly iterate over the bitmap like so: for each machine word, skip it if it is equal to 0 (all bits are clear, ie the region is fully allocated anyway), and otherwise call find-first-set to find the index of the next free region. Clear that bit (to indicate that it is now in use), and return the index of that bit to the caller (who can then use it like an index into an array, or convert it to a pointer). Freeing regions is even simpler: You just set the bit in the bitmap corresponding to the index in the memory buffer.<p>We also get another very useful operation for free with this scheme: Iterating over every object in the set. Say, we want to call &quot;update&quot; on every entity in our buffer. Make a copy of the binary set, and invert it, so that now a set bit indicates an allocated region. Then, it&#x27;s very simple to create an iterator that can traverse every entity in existence: Call find-first-set to find allocated entities, call their update function, then clear the associated bit in the inverted binary set. Keep doing so until you reach the end of the set.<p>That&#x27;s a very simple scheme to implement, but you can only really use it when it fits your memory allocation patterns well, or when you can tailor your memory allocation patterns to fit the memory management scheme. In a game, it can be acceptable to impose a hard limit on, say, the number of entities on screen (you could easily have a rule somewhere that stops spawning enemies if a certain limit has been reached, or start despawning less important entities when memory gets tight), but this probably wouldn&#x27;t fly if you were maintaining a data structure for handling website requests: &quot;Sorry, this site only supports up to 1K concurrent users, please come back later&quot;<p>Now, think about the kind of changes you might have to make to make this manager more &quot;flexible&quot;: How could you make it handle regions of various sizes? How could you make it handle growing the memory buffer (so that you can create more than the &quot;maximum&quot; number of entities)? How would you make it handle various types of objects that just happen to take the same amount of space? How about handling extremely large swaths of memory? Can we reasonably predict how the memory manager will be used in the program, or is that entirely out of our hands? The closer you get to malloc&#x27;s use case, the less useful this data structure becomes, and by the same token, you should be starting to see how a manager that is expected to perform as best as possible under <i>arbitrary</i> usage patterns can be sub-optimal for a specialized use case.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to use different memory management techniques at different levels of memory granularity. Consider that that is essentially what you&#x27;d be doing if you malloc a buffer that you then manage with the bitmapped memory allocator I described.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_first_set"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_first_set</a>",1375914141

It now takes extreme skills to successfully ship 2013-sized apps which is why a small portion of the programmers are making most of the money.<p>The next language to win will be the one that lets an intermediate team ship apps again. Java let your average C++ programmer build much bigger apps without crashing. In 2000, Java  <i>forced</i> you to program right by 2000 standards; the programmer needn&#x27;t have figured it out himself.<p>A language that lets a strong architect say, &quot;NO! you CANNOT do I/O in the view, that goes in the controller!&quot;, that lets an architect shape what good code should look like and have the language enforce it, can lead a team of intermediate programmers to success.<p>Clojure is like a musical instrument - a brilliant artist can do amazing things, but a mediocre artist will produce mediocre output. Clojure works great if you have 5 brilliant architects collaborating - Datomic, core.async, ClojureScript, all these are outputs of brilliant minds collaborating; the company behind these products has a reputation for only hiring the best of the best.<p>But I think a business can make more money by putting 5 brilliant architects on 5 separate projects and giving them a bunch of intermediate programmers.

What we&#x27;re trying to do is provide the necessary ingredients (social combined with technology) to make weight loss something people feel good about. We give people a leader, which provides trust/inspiration that they are on the right path, and a peer group for support. Early signals have been good that this keeps people engaged. That said, getting new users will always be important.<p>One additional thought is that people who are successful as members could potentially transition to the coach role after some sustained success. This could lead to very long term engagement, but it is too early to tell.<p>3) Honestly, we are focused 100% on making something that actually works.

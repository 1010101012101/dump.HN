291843,comment,291693,291693,0,0,ryanbooker,,,"It's a surprising article from Ars. Apple is a massively successful and profitable company. They don't need to commoditise OSX. They're not trying to compete on market share. They're trying make money by making better computers. Something they are doing very well thank you very much.",1220266338

The same book also introduced me to the rather fun 'Nine Mens Morris' - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Men's_Morris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Men's_Morris</a>",1220265177

I set up 1 share of value 1 pound, and then ended up with a balance of -£1. Actually, this now makes me realise that I should have paid £1 into my account for my share... so it's correct, but still a little confusing, perhaps a ""why"" link would be helpful.<p>3. There were some visual glitches with the help box in Firefox on Mac while adding a Sales entry.<p>4. I have my own numbering convention for my invoices. I should be able to enter my own invoice number, particularly when entering historical invoices.<p>5. When adding several line items to an invoice, it should automatically duplicate the tax status of the item above.<p>6. When there's only 1 account set up, the ""Cash paid into account:"" field should default to that.<p>7. I forgot to select the customer after typing it into the ""add"" box (I forgot to click add, basically). 1) the error should be more visible, 2) the field should be highlighted when i've typed something and not clicked add, so that I know there's still something to be done there.<p>8. The help is quite annoying. It should be hidden by default, I reckon.<p>Good so far though! I'll be coming back to continue setting up my accounts there. I've been looking for something like this. I'm not sure about your pricing, however... I would just keep the single-user account and print things out to send to my accountant, so you wouldn't make any money from me. However, I also wouldn't pay for it in its current state yet, so it may be worth keeping it like this for the time being until you figure out a better pricing model (or perhaps you'll find that people will sign up for it as is). Maybe you should base the charge on the turnover of the company? Free under £50k of yearly turnover... £5/m between £50-100k... £10 between 100/200... etc.<p>Hope this helps!",1220265129

291837,comment,291799,291799,0,0,dnordberg,,,"Think the design itself is quite good. Like you said, ""bit rough around the edges"" for example clicking a new tab should not center the tab on the screen. Your using vertical-align: top; but it still is centered. Maybe its just Firefox 3??<p>Also its very responsive which is good.",1220265053

291835,comment,291799,291799,0,0,maxklein,,,"I was really annoyed that I did not even see screenshots of the app and you were already asking me to pay for app. Why are there no screenshots on the frontpage?<p>And you really don't need more features, it seems already a bit full right now.<p>Very frankly, this is a tool for a real mom & pop store, and not for a web business. Put it in adobe air or one of those offline browsers and you can sell it for 300 pounds a piece as CD software. It will be more profitable than trying to convince people to use it online.<p>Personally, it's just too complicated to be useful to me. But I know that such software usually looks that way (like all those old school VB software).<p>I dunno, I'm not really qualified to judge as all I need for my accounting is just a simple 3 column spreadsheet.",1220264370

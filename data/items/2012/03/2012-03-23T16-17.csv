This is to prevent broken links over time.<p>The big providers (Elsevier, etc) are obligated to maintain the DOI no matter what happens on their end.  E.g they may completely change their site architecture, or change domain name, but as long as they keep the DOI updated with the current location of the paper nothing goes wrong.  DOI's all around the internet will still continue to point at the paper.<p>It's a lot more robust than directly linking to the paper itself.<p>COINS is a way to embed bibliographic meta-data into a webpage.  There are a number of plugins/extensions that will grab this metadata and do useful things.  One example is an extension which automatically redirects links through your library's link resolver so you get the paper and not the paywall page.",1332521951

I recall the recent HN-linked article [1], which called for a large number of people to demand a trial, rather than take a plea deal, because that would collapse the system. Or, if everyone carried a gun, openly, and without a permit, the government couldn't stop the practice because it wouldn't have the resources to disarm an entire, determined population. The same is true for these tiny flying machines. The main problem, though, is the expense, as it would be a lot easier for any given person to acquire a gun than to acquire one of these, but the principle is the same. That leads to the observation that the expense is there because of lack of innovation in the field, and said lack exists due to laws restricting the use of anything which could be built. The answer is to simply ignore the laws, while pursuing the best technical answers, such as, for example, applying the recently-developed techniques of self-assembly, from the creators of the Harvard Monolithic Bee [2], in an effort to drive down costs and democratize the process of construction and ownership of tiny copters, so that, in fact, pretty much everyone who wanted to could possess one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3690481"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3690481</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606394"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606394</a>",1332521236

Yes, PHP still has issues, especially with function naming conventions, but it still fascinates me to no end to see PHP bashed mindlessly when if you compared it to the language without the framework you might see a different picture.  
Come on guys, wake up and smell the coffee.  Every language has its own set of issue, and it has its own set of strengths.  If it was about the best, we never would have moved passed languages like Perl and C, both of which I like.

Android introduced some new driver APIs, they didn't completely change the kernel.  Check the .config file on an actual device and count the number of drivers that are absolutely identical to desktop linux.<p>And how exactly does having a microkernel fix the problem of having a stable driver API?  Drivers must be written to some framework.  Windows NT derivatives are microkernels too, and they're on, I believe, their third incompatible driver architecture.<p>And did you actually read that second link?  It's drawing a single ""kernel environment"" with all the standard kernel junk in it.  That is not a microkernel.<p>Sigh.  I probably shouldn't have gotten involved.",1332518449

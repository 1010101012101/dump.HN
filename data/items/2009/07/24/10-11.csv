721250,comment,720375,720718,0,0,cstross,,,"Anecdote from 1996 in the UK, back when web consultancy was still relatively small, but growing: fma (my employer at the time) bid for one web design job against competition. When we got the job, we learned that our bid was the highest by a factor of two! And we got the job because we were ""reassuringly expensive""!<p>Folks who don't understand a new field will throw money at it because they want a serious professional to hold their hand. As the old 80s aphorism put it, ""nobody ever got fired for buying IBM""; an executive at an FT100 company, dabbling in the web for the first time, would <i>expect</i> to spend lots of money at the steep start of the learning curve. But once they began to get a clue about how difficult (or easy) the job really was, they'd start to play hardball.<p>And that's what the early web consultancies didn't understand: they were living on borrowed time, and basing their growth on a commodity that could only scale linearly (web developer/programmer hours).",1248433019

The real question is whether a ternary-logic microprocessor would require a smaller area than a binary one, under the plausible assumption that this is proportional to depth * width. I think that would almost certainly not be the case -- binary is just so much more natural than ternary that you're just going to end up simulating ternary with binary anyway. In fact that is exactly what seems to have happened in the attempt that he describes to build a ternary computer.",1248432070

Of the 3 I had 2 were great and the one in between (the one I knew I was going to fail) was a complete asshole. I'm still not sure how the other 2 managed to find a way to make the material covered relevant, yet the 3rd guy managed to make me hate everything about him, his class, and his topics.<p>And the dude was a real hippy, but not in a cool way. All his themes were some sci-fi postapocolyptic drivel. When I brought his name up people knew of him and gave a sad frown like they knew I was suffering.

721235,comment,721006,721204,0,0,randomwalker,,,"100 and 1000 are both slightly less than powers of 2, so 2 has a slight advantage for these numbers. For sufficiently large numbers, 3 always wins. Here is a proof:<p>If there are a total of N options, the number of choices is x * d, where d is the smallest integer larger than log_x(N). When N is large enough you can approximate d by log_x(N), so the number of choices is x log N / log x. We are looking for the x that minimizes x / log x (in any base). Let us arbitrarily choose base 2. So 2 / log 2 is 2, whereas 3 / log 3 is only 1.89.<p>Incidentally, to see that the minimum of the continuous function x / log x is reached at e (although this has no relevance to the discrete problem), take the derivative and set it to zero, giving 1 / log(x)  - 1 / log^2(x) = 0, or log x = 1, giving x=e (differentiation rules are always in base e.)<p><i>Finally, if his proposition is right, does it mean that a ternary tree is a more efficient data structure than a binary tree, when there is a natural ternary separation?</i><p>This whole argument is based on an arbitrary -- and IMO, rather flimsy -- measure of efficiency as the product of depth and width. The optimal branching factor for an n-ary tree depends on many factors and is heavily dependent on the details of the implementation; no single n is always optimal. For example, when traversal of the tree involves disk seeks, a very large n such as 512 or 1024 is used.",1248431307

Why is it a mistake to assert this? Granted you point to earlier type theory which I was unaware of, but my claim wasn't that lambda calculus was original.<p><i>If you look at that, you'll discover, for example, that while having functions as first-class citizen was always a definite requirement of functional programming, neither immutable state nor TCO ever were.</i><p>Here is another big gripe of mine. Given that there are practical reasons for the earlier functional languages to have been different from the lambda calculus (speed and memory), why continue using those languages as metrics later on when the limitations of speed and memory no longer apply?",1248430507

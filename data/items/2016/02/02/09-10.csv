The two languages had similar vocabulary (e.g. AS <i>scirt</i> -- modern English <i>shirt</i> -- vs ON <i>skirt</i>, both originally referring to a unisex knee-length tunic), but different inflections: the vocabulary was kept but much of the inflection was dropped, which is why English is morphologically so much simpler than, say, German.",1454407112

11018542,comment,11018102,11018440,0,0,TheDong,,,"... Why?\nThe scalability difference (in terms of disk space) between having multiple services per container and many containers is, in practice, zero.<p>That&#x27;s because of layered filesystems and most of the language runtimes and other images pulling from a small set of base images.<p>For example, if you have two node applications, the base &quot;nodejs&quot; image is 633MB in size. If both of your applications have &quot;FROM node&quot; at the top and proceed to add different applications (say 2MB each), you&#x27;ll find the &quot;node&quot; portion is totally shared and only the diff, you copying in your application&#x27;s files, is different. You&#x27;ll only store a single copy of the 633MB node image + your two application image&#x27;s diffs, for a total of 637MB.<p>That number is the same if you bundle the applications (vertically scale as you say it).<p>This is also sorta true across language runtimes too!\nWith some creative diffing, I experimentally tested the difference between the ruby and nodejs images. It turns out there&#x27;s just under 600MB in common. The ruby image has 116MB of data the node one doesn&#x27;t, and the node one has ~40MB of data the ruby one doesn&#x27;t.<p>Again, you&#x27;ll end up using a very small amount of disk space.<p>These savings also apply to downloading images after the initial base layers are downloaded (e.g. docker pull ruby; docker pull node will only download roughly 750MB of data, even though that&#x27;s two >600MB images).<p>In any case, it&#x27;s strange that disk space on the order of a couple gigs is even a scaling concern at all; I&#x27;d imagine memory or your application&#x27;s disk needs would far outweigh such concerns.<p>My main point, however, is that your discussion of one service per container vs multiple services per container being any different in terms of disk space is rubbish and utterly false.",1454407045

In fields like medicine where some authority will look at the data eventually there&#x27;s at least some quality control (debatable as to how much) but there&#x27;s entire sections of science were it would be rather trivial to fake entire studies without even collecting data...especially since redoing experiments seems to have a bad rep, too.<p>Pretty broken system overall. I&#x27;d love if there was a step in the acceptance of papers that would say...paper accepted under the provision that the data set is made available. You still get &quot;the glory&quot; because the stuff is published and you&#x27;re the first source on it but now the data is also available.<p>Additionally, one of the goals of science is being reproducible and transparent. If an experiment is well described and reproducible, additive data sets could be built. Run a similar enough experiment but with another demographic, add to the data set...etc.<p>Edit:\nI also don&#x27;t see why the role of &quot;data gatherer&quot; can&#x27;t be more prestigious. I mean sure, traditionally you gather data for a reason and want to answer a research question with it and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re judged by. However there&#x27;s tremendous value in identifying that no good data set exists for some area and then outlining a solid, transparent and scientific process of collecting that data and executing it. I&#x27;d call that a valuable paper even if no hypotheses are tested. As long as there&#x27;s a place where you can publish those papers and make the data available it would probably also be a paper that is good for your career by a metric that seems to matter a lot.

Each of these columns is fixed-height as well (usually a bad idea in general, but it looks very ugly otherwise).<p>This works fine in the design phase, where titles are written to fit the element, but once you start working with real data, you run into a problem: one title might be three lines high, while another is only a single line high. Since you want the &#x27;columns&#x27; to be fixed height, you now have to add a lot of whitespace underneath the one-line title, so that everything lines up with the three-line title element.<p>Then you realize that you have the same problem with the subtitle and content, so now you end up with ridiculous amounts of whitespace between title, subtitle and body, depending on the length of the text within.<p>I&#x27;ve often tried to preemptively address these issues as a front-ender, but aside from this not really being my job (that&#x27;s where the value of a UX designer comes in, I guess? Or at least a web-skilled designer), I can&#x27;t always predict these kinds of things either.<p>So the best solution I&#x27;ve found is to always try to work with real data, or create enough &#x27;random&#x27; fake data to fix these kinds of issues.",1454405869

11018367,comment,11011923,11013022,0,0,bitwize,,,"I think that if you are going to teach someone the craft of programming (which is different from computer science) -- <i>really</i> teach them, you should follow what I call the Old School Curriculum. The Old School is based on the way many kids learned to program in the 80s, and the 80s version went: first BASIC, then assembly, then Pascal.<p>The first language you should learn should be a doddle to learn, even if it isn&#x27;t very powerful. This was BASIC (or sometimes Logo) back in the 80s, but you could probably substitute Python or even Scheme today. This language teaches you concepts like these:<p>* Computers follow instructions supplied by the programmer<p>* The instructions have to be carefully worded in order for a computer to follow them (i.e., intro to errors and debugging)<p>* Arithmetic and mathematical operations a computer can perform<p>* Computers can remember things (i.e., variables)<p>* Computers can interact with the world (input and output)<p>* Computers can make decisions (conditionals and program flow control)<p>These are the very fundamentals of programming and it&#x27;s amazing how many people <i>haven&#x27;t internalized these concepts at a deep level</i>.<p>You can actually get very far with BASIC -- entire companies have been run with BASIC code. (Software written in and for Business BASIC variants was a major industry back in the 1970s and 1980s.) You can get even farther with Python. But once the learner is ready to go deeper, it&#x27;s time to begin Phase 2.<p>The second language you learn should be assembly, which familiarizes the programmer with how a computer actually works at a fundamental level, as well as important concepts like CPU word length, memory addresses (essential for understanding pointers), program call and return (and stacks), etc. You don&#x27;t have to even complete a large project written in assembly to get the benefits of this low-level, bit-twiddling learning.<p>Finally, the last language you learn should be Pascal. C or C++ would be today&#x27;s equivalent. In this phase you synthesize the knowledge of high-level programming, structure, and control flow that you learned during your &quot;BASIC&quot; phase with your low-level understanding of machine details that you learned during your assembly phase. Then, the details of how and why the language works the way it does make much more sense.<p>So yes, to me it makes total sense to teach C -- as (at least) a third programming language, perhaps after several years of proficiency are acquired in the other two (depending on the student).",1454403861

The underline on links informs the user that it is a link to another page (i.e. they will be navigating away from the current page), that the interface is page based, that clicking the link will add the current page to the history and that their back button will work, etc, etc.<p>Removing the hyperlink makes the numbers look like numbers.

Frankly, the author comes off with the baffling sort of self-righteous political correctness which <i>scares</i> me a little in it&#x27;s reductiveness.<p>That said, this is obviously not the way to build a community. Kicking people out for this sort of thing sets a bad precedent.

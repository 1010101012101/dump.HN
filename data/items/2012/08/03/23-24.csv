I, and the engineers at SpaceX, are aware that most failures come from interactions between systems. And by ""extrapolate"", I didn't mean extrapolate from one part to the entire system, but from N tests to the N+1th test (because when you test as you fly and fly as you test, the actual mission is just another test).<p>Also, you conflate 'safety' with 'complete system success.' Apollo 15 had a safe, successful reentry, despite the single parachute failure, because there was designed-in redundancy. You can expect similar from SpaceX.<p>But you are right in that assigning any sort of reliability number is rediculous. On my project, we have analyzed every possible failure scenario we can think of, and come up with contingency plans on top of contingency plans, until we get to the point where so many things would have to be wrong in order for our plan to be used that it's not worth the effort, and we would think on our feet at that point.

B2B programming is an utter pile of mind-numbingly boring crap. It's not sexy because it's incredibly simple with a colossal amount of edge cases. B2B is mindbogglingly complex simple software.<p>B2B is just the edge cases.<p>It's not in the remotest bit interesting to most people. It's often bound by the most ridiculous laws and covenants.<p>But it'll make you a lot of money.<p>Do you want to read about it? No, because it's so ridiculously shallow and dull. That why no-one talks about it.<p>(disclosure: I am also writing b2b software)<p>EDIT: There was a very recent post by Intuit about the 10 million lines they've written for Quickbooks and how they manage it. That says it all to me really. 10 million lines means something has gone very, very, very wrong to me. Would you want to write a 10 million line essay about accounting? Think about your average words per line programming, that's nigh on a 50 million page essay. Just to do accounting.<p>Joy.",1344035893

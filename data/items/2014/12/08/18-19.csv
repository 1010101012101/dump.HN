If you have a job that does not require a degree, and spend 10% of your working life earning a degree instead of earning income, your lifetime income will be about 10% lower.  Its actually worse because starting wage for a coffee barista or waiter is the same, but presumably toward the end of your career you&#x27;ll make more at a better job, but a degree holder will have retired for years 36-40 whereas a non-degree holder will continue to earn income for the full 40 years at the higher 36-40 yr rate.

It uses mantle like API where you can simply spam drawcalls like no tomorrow.

All your scenes are built using effects that cause massive performance penalty in tile based renderers. Sure it works fine on Tegra K1 but everywhere else it&#x27;s horrible.<p>On the other hand there is a way of doing multiplatform development. It means using Unity (or other multiplatform engine), limiting yourself to a common subset and leaving the optimization part to be the headache of the engine developers.

One of the core principles for the GM is &quot;Ask questions, use the answers&quot;, which is wonderful to me. In a couple different games I ran of DW, we started with just the player&#x27;s character choices, and the questions I decided to ask, and got rolling from there.<p>For anyone interested--the rules are free on their website, and there&#x27;s a thriving G+ community, &quot;Dungeon World Tavern&quot; (can&#x27;t link it at work) with very creative people. Also, the &quot;Indigo Galleon&quot; adventure, from the DW website, is my favorite, and a good place to start. It was the first thing I GM&#x27;d, and I&#x27;ll be running it for a third time next Wednesday.<p>If anyone&#x27;s looking at it and has questions, let me know --I love seeing people get into this game (or pen-and-paper RPGs in general).",1418064702

Because of the 97.6k income exemption, as well as double taxation tax credits, the only real thing it does is create mountains of expensive paperwork for expats (as well as the IRS). Think along the lines of paying $5k to a specialty accountant to prove that your US tax bill is zero, every year.<p>The other part of your comment about this affecting only a small fraction of people is inaccurate. It affects all US expats - currently several million (6.32m is the last number I&#x27;ve seen). The only criterion for being affected is US citizenship. Foreign citizenship is irrelevant.

Expensive Superbowl advertisements, TV ads, radio and outlandish publicity stunts. Not to mention, the ridiculous parties CEO&#x27;s would throw.<p>This.<p>Saw this first hand with several companies. I was with a telecom CLEC and we were in a building jammed with startups in the late 90&#x27;s.<p>I would agree with all your points and also add most of the companies I saw guys who had been toiling in middle management their whole careers, suddenly got a shot at running their own show. They got drunk on the money and power and ran most of the companies into the ground by burning through their money and making asinine decisions.<p>The CLEC I was working for was a perfect example.<p>When I was brought on as a sales person, this was the pitch in the interview:<p>&quot;We want our sales people to be the highest paid sales people in the industry. We&#x27;re going to offer more salary and more commission then any other CLEC in town,&quot; This was a CLEC who had 15 employees, and were trying to hire three sales people.<p>Their commission structure would be outrageous for a fortune 500 company, but this was a CLEC startup in a middle tier market. Your quota every month was 60 lines. You got a bonus for hitting your goal, then each tier above that was additional commission.<p>Here&#x27;s their tiered structure:<p>60 lines - $5,000<p>70 lines - $3,000<p>80 lines - $4,000<p>100 lines - $5,000<p>Let&#x27;s say I land a nice commercial building with several tenets and the first month I land three companies all three of their contracts equal 70 lines. It would mean I get my $5K for hitting my quota and another $3K bonus for hitting the 70 line tier.<p>I thought this was awesome. Then after two months I suddenly realized something. I asked around to see what the margins were on the lines we were reselling.<p>On each line the company was making a pretty nice margin, around $20/per line. Now, you compare that with the commissions they were paying us. You do a little math and realize it&#x27;s going to take them over 6 months <i>just to break even</i> on the commission they were paying versus what revenue they had coming in from our sales. More lines? More commission and longer wait times to realize a profit. Even though I was still in college, it was obvious to me this was not a smart business decision.<p>EDIT: CLEC stands for Competitive Local Exchange Carrier",1418061982

Your premise is rise of salaries should be checked. Now let&#x27;s say once those salaries were checked by companies by promising not to hire each other engineers, if those companies decided well let&#x27;s reduce the salaries of our own engineers since they are not going to get a better deal elsewhere anyways. Very soon those salaries will be plummeting because of this agreement between the companies. You contradict yourself by the end when you say &quot;EVERYONE gets paid market rate&quot; It is NOT market rate if all companies in the market got together and decided not to offer higher wages to someone to incentivize them to come work for them.

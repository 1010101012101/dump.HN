Any power that Google or Reddit has is the outcome of providing value to their customers, and in return their customers providing dollars or time. Any such ""power"" is not the result of legislation and enforcement at the point of a gun. No legislation forces you to use Google.<p>On the other hand, the MPAA/RIAA paying millions of dollars to buy off politicians and write legislation is very obviously an abuse of power, power that was never voluntarily granted to them in the first place. If this law passes, you will absolutely be forced at gunpoint to conform to the will of the MPAA.",1326862758

A renowned story-teller, teacher and youth leadership champion, Larry has also coached and mentored countless numbers of students on start-up business management and career development strategies.<p>Having taught introductory microeconomics, macroeconomics and entrepreneurship classes, he recently celebrated assigning his 29,000th grade earlier this year.<p>Recipient of the Distinguished Teacher Award, Larry has also coached several of his former students to help them position and develop their businesses, the most famous of which is Research in Motion (RIM), maker of the revolutionary BlackBerry wireless mobile smartphone. Larry also sits on the advisory panels of start-ups to provide his guidance on financing and negotiation with investors and venture capitalists.<p>http://www.tedxuw.com/speakers/larry-smith/<p>---<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",1326862649
3477960,comment,3475511,3475511,1,0,ilaksh,,,"I don't believe that agile is really going away, but it is definitely not really the hot thing anymore, at this point, many years since it first became a trend.<p>And probably a growing number of people are going to be put off by their experiences with ""agile"", if they are anything like mine have been.<p>Managers love the idea of releasing more often and understand that.  And that part can be an improvement.<p>However, quite a few people seem to think that means you can fit that many more features in, which is false.<p>This is the big challenge for agile in my opinion: automated testing or even testing at all, is hard for many development teams for a number of reasons.  Not to say that the actual skills or knowledge are particularly difficult to acquire.  But practically speaking, putting into place a good testing and release system are challenging for many teams.<p>And doing ""agile"" (read: code and release more features faster) without solid automated testing or at least one real QA analyst who is busy, will guarantee that you have a ton of regressions and broken deployments.  Now, since you are releasing much more often, you will still gain from getting much more feedback from customers, but there will be loud drone of bug fixing conflicting with the ""agile"" manager's push to release more features.<p>If your implementation of ""agile"" actually includes frequent refactoring and you don't have unit or at least integration tests, you are definitely going to be sorry.<p>Test-driven development requires a little bit more discipline, sometimes more up-front design, and sometimes investment in developer training.  If TDD or the like is off the table or only partially implemented but you are still going ahead with ""agile"", then you still might survive, if you have a real QA analyst and solid process.  My perception and experience is that most managers will decide that hiring an additional person ""just for testing"" is ""not in the budget"" and if they do bring someone onto the project for QA they will think they can use just any person rather than hiring a single QA professional.<p>That has been my experience with agile.  Several years in, I am still working on trying to discipline myself and with my latest project I am having a bit of success with vows-bdd integration tests.  But TDD/BDD etc. is a skillset that takes time to develop and a discipline that I believe young developers will greatly benefit from if it is part of their early training and experience.",1326862643

Nvidia binary driver on Linux? Dead. All out of tree kernel modules? Utterly, utterly dead. Building an updated driver locally? Not going to happen. That's going to make some people fairly unhappy.""<p>Making secure boot meaningful on Linux would be a big project - you'd also have to sign most of the stuff in userland.  But if it were done, it would be done by the distro, which could easily enough sign the kernel module in its VirtualBox package and whatever else users might want to load into the kernel.  Since this would presumably be optional (there would be an alternate signed bootloader that loaded an unsigned kernel for developers and power users), the GPL3 would be satisfied; and the end result is a system that's significantly harder to attack.  I don't know if that's worth the effort, considering the lack of actual malware for Linux, but as long as the key is installed along with the OS, it's hardly an impossibility.",1326862518

It's much like a spreadsheet.<p>- A few code snippets are of historical interest in that they have unfortunately caused satellites to fall out of orbit.<p>- Some code snippets have been used as email signatures for political reasons, such as short implementations of RSA or DeCSS.<p>- David A. Wheeler's website has a nice rundown of modern history's important software innovations, but only a couple of those, like RSA, can be implemented in a few (appropriately) cryptic lines.<p>- There are a number of mathematical algorithms of interest, such as the Euclidean algorithm for greatest common divisor (GCD) and the Newton or Newton-Raphson method.<p>- Some modern fundamental algorithms such as binary search and quicksort are compact.<p>- You might like some variant of ""the computus"", the formula for calculating the date of Easter. It bores me, but I enjoy the similar Zeller's congruence.<p>- The movie ""The Social Network"" features something like the tf-idf formula and the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" features Nash equilibrium.<p>- The Ackermann function is fun, being a brief and notably slow formula for practically all arithmetic. Going the other way around you get Peano axioms and perhaps computations with Church numerals.<p>- A grammar for the lambda calculus can be three simple lines.<p>- Our gracious host in ""The Roots of Lisp"" states Lisp ""eval"" somewhat briefly, based on McCarthy's original, which Alan Kay called ""Maxwell's equations of software"".<p>- The truth table for NAND is a nice little graphic and the NAND function happens to be sufficient to implement all Boolean functions.<p>Now we could start to get into other diagrams from computer science and software engineering, but that's a vast area and you didn't actually ask for it.",1326860250

I would point out that the first edition of McConnell's <i>Code Complete</i> was published in 1993 and didn't say much about OOP, yet OOP was already in use by many professional developers, and books about languages supporting it had been published many years earlier: the first edition of <i>The C++ Programming Language</i> was published in 1985, for example. Similarly, the second edition of <i>Code Complete</i> was published in 2004, yet contains no index entry for the word ""concurrent"" or ""parallel"" (though there is a passing reference to multithreading on page 337).

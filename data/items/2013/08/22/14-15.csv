They need to explain to the greater public why this matters and what they can do about it. They need to get over the threshold of &quot;this is conspiracy nuts, leave me alone&quot;. This is the most disturbing thing I&#x27;ve seen: people see some of the facts, and they decide that it is paranoia.<p>If we have the educators, we need to advertise them to extreme limit, ensuring that everyone gets their message at least five times in some format.<p>The topic is really hard, because one needs to crush various myths:\n - that we can be safe, no matter what,\n - that the people in government are good and honest,\n - that it can happen to them and not only to others...<p>... while you keep their engagement level and focus up.",1377183534

Are you seriously saying that every single user will waste 72 seconds every single day when they use LibreOffice?<p>1. Regarding productivity tools, people tend to do roughly the same thing at work each day.  What they type in might be different, but what they want the software to do doesn&#x27;t differ that much.<p>2. People tend to be able to remember things from one day to the next.  If I start using a new IDE, I don&#x27;t have to spend an extra minute every single day for a year looking for the &quot;build&quot; button or shortcut.  A user who works out how to format a line as a heading in LibreOffice won&#x27;t sit around the next day, confused about how to format a line as a heading.<p>3. Regarding most commonly used functionality, the UI of LibreOffice is pretty intuitive for someone who has used any kind of office productivity software.<p>4. Regarding rarer functionality (e.g. Pivot tables) I would be surprised if anywhere near 100000 of those 120000 users ever use them.  Most people just use a spreadsheet as a place to put tabular data, many don&#x27;t even do simple calculations like summing with it.  Most people just type big globs of text into word processors and do some simple formatting.  Those who do use less common functionality tend to have the ability to work it out pretty quickly and either remember it or write it down.<p>As many have already said.  The unfamiliarity problem you describe is the same with a new version of MS Office.  When I got a new version of MS Office, I spent some time trying to find features that I used a lot before, but once I found them, I was back up to speed.  If the timing of the change corresponds to the need to upgrade MS Office (e.g. existing version going out of support), then the disruption would be pretty much the same.",1377182993

6257455,comment,6256384,6257286,3,0,pdonis,,,"<i>it is almost impossible to find a situation where there is a singular human cause.</i><p>But if you can focus in on a single technical decision that had such a large impact, you can at least focus attention on how that particular technical decision got made. Yes, many humans will have been involved even in that single technical decision; but it&#x27;s still a lot more manageable to look into how it got made than to look at how the entire plant got designed.<p><i>We could do something silly to consolidate the guilt</i><p>I&#x27;m not talking about guilt; I said I wasn&#x27;t advocating ritual suicide. I&#x27;m talking about how to prevent it from happening again. To do that, you need to be able to focus on <i>something</i> that can actually be changed. Take your bus driver example:<p><i>Do we punish the driver for his negligence, or his shift supervisor for threatening him into taking an extra-long shift, or someone even further up who knowingly encouraged a culture of overwork?</i><p>Depends on the facts. Was the driver negligent? Could he have reasonably predicted that he would fall asleep at the wheel? How could he have acted on such a prediction?<p>Did the supervisor actually threaten him into taking an extra-long shift? If so, how did he get away with it? Aren&#x27;t there rules about preventing driver fatigue? (Certainly commercial airline crews have strict rules about how long they can fly before they have to rest.) If not, why not?<p>Is there a systemic culture of overwork, encouraged from higher up? Do bus drivers in this company routinely drive longer hours than the industry average? Than the average in other similar occupations?<p>The point is that if you can focus in on specific causal chains, you can direct efforts at changing them. In the case of Fukushima, if you can focus in on how the technical decision to site the backup generators that way got made, you can direct efforts at improving that process. Did the engineers just not realize that siting the backup generators that way was a bad idea? Was the question never even asked? Or did the engineers realize it, but management overruled them? Or did the original design have them sited differently, but time pressure during construction persuaded someone (<i>not</i> the engineers or managers who did the original design) to change the location in order to meet some deadline?<p>All this, btw, reinforces your point that ritual suicide doesn&#x27;t help anything.",1377182816

The answer: because people think &quot;escaping&quot; is the answer.<p>Imagine constructing a function in some other language this way:<p><pre><code>    function square(x) {\n        code = x + &quot;*&quot; + x;\n        return eval(code);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is obviously wrong. Now, let&#x27;s say I suggest fixing it with escaping:<p><pre><code>    function square(x) {\n        code = escape(x) + &quot;*&quot; + escape(x);\n        return eval(code);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAny sane programming community would string me up by my thumbs for doing this, and rightly so.<p>Yet, do the exact same thing in SQL and it&#x27;s just business as usual. <i>Occasionally</i> people talk about prepared statements and parameterized queries and such, but usually people just talk about escaping. As if the problem is just that you need more backslashes, not that you&#x27;re glomming strings together at runtime and then calling eval() on them.<p>It&#x27;s so bizarre. People would think you&#x27;re crazy for doing it in one environment, but doing it in a different environment where the exact same problems are present is just fine!

Have you budgeted properly for the time of experienced people to fill out paper work and the potential disruption of everyone else if a full audit is requested (the license agreement says that can call one of those when-ever they like IIRC).<p>Sometimes using Office most definitely is the right answer (the &quot;compatibility with our suppliers/clients&quot; issue often can&#x27;t not be ignored for a start) but when it isn&#x27;t the correct answer pure licensing costs are not always the only reason.<p><i>> What was the cost of: Re-imaging those 120,000 desktops?</i><p>The costs of this change per desktop will be similar to an upgrade of Office.<p>If they are upgrading from an older version of office that is no longer supported and the choice is between newer office and OO/LO then this is moot. There may be a bit of extra time at the start of the project as those running it get familiar with OO/LO&#x27;s installation foibles, but considered per desktop this is not going to be high.<p>In fact installing OO as a new package may be more risk free as it can co-exist with their current version of Office, so they have an easy fallback/rollback or slow transition option.<p><i>> Re-training the (I assume) 100,000+ users?</i><p>The differences are not that significant. If they are moving from a relatively old version of office then the retraining for the newest Office variant could easily be more significant due to the UI changes over recent years.<p>If they have any custom training materials then there will be a cost for updating these, but then there will be for Office too.<p><i>> And what are the support costs? </i><p>Again, I doubt these will be significantly different. There might be a little more effort needed here due to people being familiar with Office due to the copy they run at home or used at a previous employer, but again there is the &quot;which office version&quot; difference which may make this a moot point.

Anyone reading your code will be confused by this usage and that&#x27;s not a good thing. It probably would be best to use this:<p><pre><code>    match key.cmp(self.block_size) {\n        Equal => ..\n        Greater => ..\n        Less => ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhich is much prettier (and more succinct) than both your original code and my example.

One cubic kilometer of water weighs about a billion metric tons; so the a million metric tons of radioactive water is one 660 billionth of the volume of the Pacific Ocean.<p>Now let&#x27;s talk about the fuel rods. An accident involving those could potentially have effects similar to Chernobyl in terms of spreading radiation; but since there are four reactors at risk at Fukushima, we would expect the global effects to be about four times the global effect of Chernobyl.

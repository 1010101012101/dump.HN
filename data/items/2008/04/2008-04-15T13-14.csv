I think everyone is missing the point, and this has frustrated me for some time.<p>What's important to the mobile web isn't presentation, it's <i>context</i>.  It's correct to say that mobile browsers are no longer the sub-par readers of teeny-tiny pages anymore.  But the type of information you want when you've got one hand free riding the subway, or when you're stranded in an airport, or when you're waiting in line at an ATM, is fundamentally different than the kind of information you want when you're sitting at a PC or laptop.  <i>That's</i> the key to understanding the mobile web - it's context.  When a user is browsing on a handheld device, chances are that they want more concise bits of data, or data which is related to their geographic position, or a way to remotely ""check in"" with a home base.<p>I've tried to envision a business that addresses this gap, but I haven't quite gotten there yet.  Anyone have any ideas?  :)",1208267938

I even wrote a little mini-response to it on my own blog.<p>I liked it mostly because it made me think really hard about what motivated me, and I concluded that it's not programming, which is what I do for a living.

I have this site called http://rivals4ever.com. In one line it is ""Community based on Rivalries"". You can create your own rivalries on this site and invite your friends to join and have kinda virtual fight with each other.<p>Now we need help in divising proper algorithm for the homepage listing of Rivalries. We tried 2-3 so far but none is giving satisfactory result.<p>We want something like this site where news on homepage constantly gets changed everytime you refresh or something like reddit or digg. But in our case there are many more parameters which can be considered while designing the algorithm.<p>1) creator rating
2) number of videos/images/weapons/weakness
3) quantity and quality of content etc

Heres why: in most sciences, big bones are made from small bones.<p>(I'm sure there is some flavor of this in paleontology as well. But I don't like the analogy because to people like me who know very little about bone hunting, it sounds very wrong.)<p>Let me give an example. I'm hunting a big bone right now: clearer MRI images from low resolution data.<p>To do that, I need the following small bones:<p>1. Understanding why low resolution data sucks, and finding unused information. (This is something along the lines of literature review.)<p>2. Small bone: How to optimally extract that data?<p>3. Small bone: Result of step 2 gives me an unordered list of points. All I know is they are samples from some set of smooth closed curves, and I also know the tangents to the curve at each point. How do I get the curves?<p>3a. Smaller bone: some points are wrong. Can I figure out which, and ignore them?<p>3b. How much of this can I prove?<p>4. Small bone: If I knew these curves, how do I use them to get a picture that a radiologist will like?<p>(Step 3 gets extra emphasis, since that's what I'm doing right now. ).<p>Every scientist is a small bone hunter. The only question is whether they are looking for small bones to build one particular big bone (like me), or whether they are search for small bones in some region where they like the scenery.",1208265030

Who would foot the bill for everything that we use now? End-users?<p>HTML is a leveler for a lot of people, and it helps designers and developers actually work together, instead of being limited (VS.NET), it also allows for quick (albeit not always concurrent) innovation, and competition. TCP/IP Is so well generalized that you can do anything with it.  Redundancy is not well executed, but it doesn't have to be if the pipes get bigger.<p>Doing things like calling new developers ""incompetent morons"" stifles innovation.

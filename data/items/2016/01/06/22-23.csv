Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an &quot;intelligence explosion,&quot; and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.&quot;<p>A merely human-level AI is one that can match to some window of performance a random human in the intellectual outputs of that human, which are vast and general -- playing games, writing poetry, critiquing film, building small rockets, having conversations, programming, carving wood, teaching a class, diagnosing and fixing a leak, constructing mathematical models... For things that require a body, it suffices to instruct a human what to do, but this thing might as well help design a robot body that&#x27;s at least as versatile as a human body since we humans do that too even if Atlas is still pretty far off. We&#x27;re unlikely to have an AI perfectly human-equivalent in the sense that it would probably by default already be superior in some ways by virtue of its ability to not need sleep, do calculations efficiently and correctly, have access to perfect memory, and so on, and unless it&#x27;s ultraintelligent then it&#x27;s probably not better than a random human at everything (say directing a movie) just like you aren&#x27;t.",1452121124

They give a the laser operator a set of windows in which they will not hit a sat if they turned the laser on.<p>The bigger challenge is while microwave emitters are cheaper, the beam director becomes quite expensive as it has to be massive (thanks to diffraction). Even with lasers, your final optics need to be big, but still easy enough to move at orbital velocities (think something like what telescopes used to track regular rocket launches use).<p>What the article didn&#x27;t mention, is you will need 2 ground power sites.

Additionally, they could even be dropped from their policy for disclosing that they are a rideshare driver.<p>> Since it’s not really in Uber’s best interest to disclose the lack of collision coverage during Period 1, many drivers don’t discover that they’re not covered until it’s too late.  I’ve been researching rideshare insurance options in Nevada since Uber went live and spoken with hundreds of Uber drivers yet we haven’t been able to find a single insurance carrier willing to insure rideshare drivers.  Some carriers offer a commercial policy but the cost is prohibitive at $3,000-$5,000 a year.<p>> Meanwhile, risk-averse insurance companies have been excruciatingly slow to adapt to this new and innovative form of transportation.  I maintain an up to date list of insurance options by state for Uber drivers on my site and you’ll notice that Nevada is not currently on that list.  There literally isn’t a single option for drivers which unfortunately is somewhat typical.  A majority of states in the US still don’t offer a rideshare friendly personal insurance or hybrid policy for Uber drivers which means a whole lot of drivers are forced to lie to their insurance carriers or find a different line of work.<p>There are some pretty significant gaps in that coverage that shift the burden to drivers, depending on the state.<p>In fact there is an entire business built around the fact there are massive holes in that policy:<p><a href=""https://www.metromile.com/uber/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.metromile.com/uber/</a><p>> Traditional auto insurance policies may not provide clear coverage for drivers who participate in ridesharing programs.

Now, Metromile offers complete clarity to Uber driver partners.<p>The difference with Uber is the driver gets fucked instead of the Taxi/Uber company.<p>> As for health insurance, from what I&#x27;ve read a lot of cab drivers aren&#x27;t full-time employees either, so they also don&#x27;t get health insurance, or benefits.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to bother with this one.

Troll on my turf, I will ban you.  Not some set of rules taking action, a human (that being me) will exert authority (that being the mighty banhammer) and that&#x27;s how it will be.

Its very weird because the person applying the CoC is too passive and has too little agency to, say, wield the banhammer and eliminate the threat without need of formal rules and regulations.  Yet, has enough agency to force everyone else to work under a CoC, which simultaneously implies the same people that can&#x27;t autonomously be trusted to exhibit common sense will none the less be forced by the rules to apply the rules they were too timid to apply by themselves without the CoC.  Its very weird logic twisting.<p>If you trust individual leaders, the CoC is useless because the have the agency to wield the banhammer with no need for rules.  If you don&#x27;t trust the leaders, the CoC is useless because they won&#x27;t enforce it.<p>So what is the use of a CoC?

You&#x27;re afraid that you will lose your job, or you are afraid that you will be criticized or that you will lose your popularity, or you&#x27;re afraid someone will stab you, or shoot at you or bomb your house; so you refuse to take the stand.<p>Well, you may go on and live until you are 90, but you&#x27;re just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90. And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit.</i><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOjpaIO2seY&t=18m26s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOjpaIO2seY&t=18m26s</a><p>>  In a society of equals, for anyone to die unnecessarily is a tragedy. For someone to choose to die, it is a horror.<p>Here&#x27;s a secret: everybody dies, either way. The only choice you have is how you live. From John J. Chapman&#x27;s commencement address to the graduating class of Hobart College, 1900:<p><i>If you wish to be useful, never take a course that will silence you. Refuse to learn anything that implies collusion, whether it be a clerkship or a curacy, a legal fee or a post in a university. Retain the power of speech no matter what other power you may lose. If you can take this course, and in so far as you take it, you will bless this country. In so far as you depart from this course, you become dampers, mutes, and hooded executioners.</i><p>>  It is not fitting to convince anyone to believe they are so unworthy that the best way they might serve others is by throwing themselves into fires that need never have been lit.<p>People who are great don&#x27;t need to be convinced of anything. People who aren&#x27;t are impossible to convince. And it&#x27;s not &quot;fitting&quot; to justify stoking fires because otherwise others would do it, either. Then let those others do it? And hey, for all you know, they all might be doing it because otherwise <i>you</i> would do it.<p>And who is actually sacrificing? People who aren&#x27;t sacrificing their ideals and their morals, or people who sacrifice them for some food and a few decades more?",1452120452

Long story short, it was impossible without breaking applications and lots of staff back when UNIX had &quot;dozens&quot; of system calls. It&#x27;s not going to work this time.<p>The solution high assurance security adopted was to virtually or physically isolate a UNIX/Linux stack that interacted with security-critical software that ran directly on microkernel and through mediated interfaces. This resulted in commercial work like INTEGRITY-178B and LynxSecure with Nizza, Perseus, and OKL4/OKLinux in OSS space. Look up &quot;Mikro-SINA VPN&quot; (yes with a k) for great case study. Middleware like Camkes was developed for integration. Similarly, kernels like INTEGRITY and PikeOS developed safe/secure runtimes that ran directly on kernel for Ada and Java.<p>What this project and all others like it need to do is this:<p>A. Drop all efforts at rebuilding UNIX in language X.<p>B. Get a user-mode version of Linux running on it with user-space drivers on microkernel for one, easily-acquired board.<p>C. Redirect safe language efforts on creating a secure runtime on the microkernel.<p>D. Create middleware tools along lines of Protocol Buffers, ZeroMQ, or LANGSEC stuff. These should allow seemless, efficient integration between untrusted (esp GUI) stuff in Linux VM and trusted stuff in safe lang uage runtime.<p>E. Begin on a POSIX-like runtime whose components can be stripped on a case-by-case basis. Focus on syscalls used by critical libraries and services first.<p>F. The current goal of full POSIX. 99% dont make it to E. If they get here, then great. If to E, then we get at least some apps. If to C and D, then we at least have trustworthy runtime.<p>That&#x27;s my two cents worth and builds on what&#x27;s historically happened in these efforts.",1452120161

10854444,comment,10853115,10854019,0,0,amyjess,,,"Sadly, a lot of terrible cab drivers are moving over to Uber and Lyft now, and they&#x27;re bringing with them the bad attitudes that drove people away from cabs.<p>I&#x27;m a frequent Lyft rider. One of my worst experiences recently was with a guy who spoke extremely broken English and who could barely understand English either. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but Apple Maps told him my house was someplace it wasn&#x27;t (I didn&#x27;t realize this was Apple Maps fucking up at the time; I&#x27;ve since begun texting drivers coming to my house telling them to not use Apple Maps), so I had to call him on the phone. It took a solid five minutes for him to understand that he&#x27;s in the wrong location and needs to drive a few more blocks to find me, and he refused to exit his nav and look where I dropped the pin (I always take extra care to put the pin in the right spot). It took so long because his English was word salad, and he didn&#x27;t understand basic words like &quot;keep driving forward&quot;. Then, when he got to my place, I went to sit in the front (which I always do, and Lyft encourages), and as soon as I opened the door, he <i>shouted</i> at me &quot;HEY, I&#x27;M UP HERE! GET IN BACK!&quot; (the most coherent thing he said to me the whole time). Fortunately, the ride wasn&#x27;t too far, so I just endured it and one-starred him when I got to my destination.<p>His rating was already at 4.5, which is below Lyft&#x27;s termination threshold; I probably should&#x27;ve cancelled as soon as I saw it. Hopefully the one star I gave him was enough to get him kicked off the platform.<p>I&#x27;ve also had other bad experiences from drivers who act like their job is to milk their passengers:<p>- One guy also demanded I ride in the back. When I got in, I saw why: the inside door panels and the backs of the front seats were <i>covered</i> in advertising for his private driver service. If I knew then that was against the TOS, I would&#x27;ve had a nice chat with Trust & Safety.<p>- A driver took the wrong turn and got into an express toll lane on the freeway. Because of that, he missed the exit and we had to go on a long detour. He started ranting, saying &quot;I&#x27;m trying trying to run a business here but people keep hitting me with all these tolls!&quot;. Also, this was another guy who made me ride in the back. Yeah, there&#x27;s a pattern with these people. Because of that, making me ride in the back is now a guarantee you&#x27;ll never get more than three stars from me (3-star or less means you&#x27;re never matched with me again).<p>- A superstitious guy who refused to trust the voice nav... so to verify that the directions will indeed get us there, he started thumbing through the turn-by-turn directions with his face buried in the phone so he can&#x27;t see the road, driving 20mph on the service road of a freeway. After the third time I told him to trust the nav and that I&#x27;ve taken Lyft from this place to that place dozens of times before, and he refused, I had him cancel the ride and let me out. I complained to Lyft and got my money back (because he charged me for the ride).<p>- Drivers, plural, who report that they&#x27;ve arrived before they actually get here. Dude, I can see your car coming down the street in the distance. You&#x27;re not here yet.<p>- Driver who, on the way, pulled over at a gas station and texted me demanding I send him my destination address. When I told him I already entered it into the system, he cancelled the ride. My guess is he was going to cancel if the destination wasn&#x27;t far enough away or maybe he was trying to redline me (the system only shows destination addresses once the driver reports they&#x27;ve arrived). Nothing of value was lost.<p>- Drivers who insist on parking a couple of blocks from my office building and then demanding I walk to their car instead of them driving up to my building. I&#x27;m not even on a busy city street... I work in the burbs! Also, the path from my office building to their car is always unlit, and it mostly happens when it&#x27;s dark out. Sorry, but I&#x27;m a woman... I&#x27;m not walking through an unlit area at night to meet a driver who&#x27;s exhibiting sketchy behavior. I&#x27;ll just cancel and eat the fee. Bonus points to the guy who told me that I need to look at the Lyft map and walk to where his car is. He was laughing when he said it, too. Not my first bad experience with him: I cancelled on him once before after he was rude to me on the phone (and he has a very unique name I remembered). Since then, if I see his name come up, I immediately cancel. Guy is seriously creepy. He&#x27;s not the only one who does this: maybe 5% of drivers who pick me up from work pull this, and they&#x27;re all creepy guys who you can tell used to be cab drivers.<p>- One time I <i>did</i> walk the block or two over to the guy in a scenario like the above (one of the few times a driver pulled this when it was light out), he started ranting at me about how I kept him waiting for three minutes. When I said &quot;I was expecting you to arrive where I actually was&quot;, he told me to get out of his car. As I was getting out, I told him I was complaining about him to Lyft, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t care, I work for myself&quot;, and then I walked back to my office building. As I was about to request a new ride, he drives over to me and physically chases me into the building. Luckily, I got in the elevator before he could. My boss called the police, they made sure he left (according to the police, he wanted to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t do anything to hurt his reputation), and I then had a nice long chat with Trust & Safety.<p>There&#x27;s a common thread here: people who think that they run private driver businesses and claim to just use Lyft as a tool are always the worst drivers.<p>Actually, 90% of drivers I deal with are perfectly pleasant. I just ride Lyft <i>a lot</i>, so I meet more drivers than the average person, and these experiences stick out in my mind.",1452120012

This also implies a number of other properties, such as freedom from buffer overflows, null pointer exceptions, use-after-free, etc.<p>There is a further proof that the binary code which executes on the hardware is a correct translation of the C code. This means that the compiler does not have to be trusted, and extends the functional correctness property to the binary.<p>Furthermore, there are proofs that seL4&#x27;s specification, if used properly, will enforce integrity and confidentiality, core security properties. Combined with the proofs mentioned above, these properties are guaranteed to be enforced not only by a model of the kernel (the specification) but the actual binary that executes on the hardware. Therefore, seL4 is the world&#x27;s first (and still only) OS that is proved secure in a very strong sense.<p>Finally, seL4 is the first (and still only) protected-mode OS kernel with a sound and complete timeliness analysis. Among others this means that it has provable upper bounds on interrupt latencies (as well as latencies of any other kernel operations).

Probably (potentially?) cleaner than uber imo: leather seats are way easier to clean than cloth, and most ubers I&#x27;ve ridden in have cloth seats.  Taxis tend to be unhappy if you pay with a card, but telling them they&#x27;ll accept a card or nothing generally works.<p>The problem is taxis just don&#x27;t come.  There are relatively few areas of sf and times where you can reasonably street hail.  So you&#x27;re left with calling one of the multiple taxi services, and they make it readily apparent they don&#x27;t give a fuck less about you.  This worked as a business model only because there was no alternative.<p>My personal story: I had a badly broken leg (9+ months on crutches) and had to take taxis daily.  From near mission/23rd (a population center), an 80% wait time for a taxi was approx 75 minutes and a 95% wait time 180 minutes.  For a 16 minute drive to soma.  They simply -- and a dispatcher admitted this to you -- lie when you call and ask the wait time.  They couldn&#x27;t follow simple requests like giving me a 5 minute warning call when they were about to arrive so I could crutch down stairs without making the driver wait.  None of the services, even when told I&#x27;d be riding them 10x/week and had mobility problems, would come reliably.<p>I took a lot of ubers even when they cost thrice what taxis did, simply because when you requested one, they told you if they were going to come.  So if the wait time was too long, you could be an adult and make alternate arrangements.  Taxis just leave you wondering if they&#x27;re going to come.  The impact on your life of using taxis, thus having to leave 90 minutes before you want to get to the office (and leaving at 5pm/commute rush hour) is really shitty.<p>It&#x27;s similar down the peninsula.  I left sf and made the mistake of calling a taxi because a car was in the shop.  Dispatch said 15-20 minutes.  An hour in I called an Uber.  Would you believe the driver has the giant balls to call 75 minutes after I requested a taxi to complain because I ditched and didn&#x27;t call to cancel?  I only waited 4 times their maximum estimate.<p>I&#x27;d love to take taxis instead of Ubers.  I think Uber pays their drivers too little and is exploitative.  Hopefully they will be forced to pay drivers more; I&#x27;ll keep using them if so.

If you&#x27;re trying to suss out a bot without alerting or annoying others I think a fancy convoluted question will kind of give you away. Also I think a clever bot (not even AI) would just sidestep weird or out of context questions. Restricting the queries to a chat room hamstrings one&#x27;s attempts, but that&#x27;s the basis of classic Turing tests.<p>But here&#x27;s the rub.

10608625,comment,10601237,10601237,0,0,SkewnessLover,,,"I worked in the cat industry for a few years and I take huge issue with the author&#x27;s conclusion.<p>&quot;Indeed, some specific corporate entities are large enough in themselves to be meaningful drivers of such changes. Upon which those same entities are now in a position, potentially, to capitalize, by means of well-placed cat bond bets. Which, looked at this way, amount to bets on a game in which they are actual players. \n&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s look at how someone could make money off of a parametrically-triggered cat bond:\n1.) The &quot;profit&quot; is taking out a loan and not being required to repay it. \n2.) The event occurs within the timeframe of the bond (3 years max, the Artemis site may reveal some longer terms but in my experience most are relatively short).\n3.) The bond issuer has no offsetting exposures (i.e. an insurance company that does NOT write earthquake insurance issuing an earthquake bond).<p>While all of these are theoretically possible, the mechanics of the cat bond market make all 3 occurring at once highly unlikely and probably a terrible investment. The bankers selling the bond would have a difficult time finding buyers for a non-insurance entity. The cat bond being triggered would immediately focus a lot of attention on the issuer, leading to some pretty terrible PR.  The list goes on.<p>Simply put, it is a huge unleveraged bet on something the issuer MAY have some control over. If an issuer wanted to adversely affect a number of innocent people for financial gain, there are a lot more profitable ways to do it via lobbying or other means.<p>Cat bonds are very interesting and complex instruments and the dominance of a few catastrophe models is an issue, especially when they are wrong (the Tuscaloosa and Joplin events led to many investors in a few bonds losing their principal because the probability of these tail events was grossly underestimated).<p>This sounds more like an academic looking for another way to demonize a socially beneficial area of finance.",1448153440

Creating an open source library that others use is one of the strongest signals I can think of.<p>Things that are involved with creating an open source library that I can think of off the top of my head:<p><pre><code>  - Set up a build system\n  - Use a test suite\n  - Choose and follow a coding standard\n  - Issue tracking\n  - Bug report system\n  - Source control (good branching practices/ whatever best practices \n    your favorite source control promotes)\n  - Create a specification / roadmap (months of coding can save hours of planning)\n  - Documentation\n     a) Determining convention\n     b) Actually creating clear documentation\n     c) Updating documentation through changes\n  - Writing code that just works\n</code></pre>\nAnd that is all just by yourself. Then if you have users and are building a community<p><pre><code>  - Communicate architecture to random strangers using\n    specifications that they understand\n  - Collaborate to develop roadmap /architecture with input\n    from other developers\n  - Communicate in a way as to not piss off strange\n    developers who decide to help you for free\n</code></pre>\nThe understanding of data structures and algorithms are only a small part of the puzzle. If a programmer can demonstrate all of those industry standard behaviors on their own time, then I don&#x27;t care that much if they don&#x27;t remember what a skip list or some other crap like that is. You can teach a developer all of the special data structures that your code base uses in a week. On the other hand it can take from months to never of steeping time in order to get developers up to speed with all of the house-keeping I described above.<p>TL;DR<p>Contribute to open source, start your own open source project because the skills required cover 90% of what programmers need to know. The CS theory stuff is the smallest and easiest part to train up. Show that you know how to execute well on the 90%, and companies will fall over themselves to train you on their own dime for the tiny subset of CS theory that they use.",1448153255

10608607,comment,10607764,10608323,0,0,DonaldFisk,,,"The problem with phage therapy is partly economic, partly regulatory, and partly practical.<p>Unlike antibiotics, phages are entirely natural, and so can&#x27;t be patented; in a bacterial broth they multiply at an astonishing rate (about a thousandfold every hour IIRC); and they&#x27;re obtained from stuff which we have so much of that a large part of our infrastructure has been built just to get rid of it (raw sewage).   So there&#x27;s no money to be made out of phage therapy, and it threatens whatever money pharmaceutical companies make out of selling antibiotics.   So, it&#x27;s no surprise they were a big success in communist countries and a failure in capitalist ones.   After the fall of communism, they continue to be used in Georgia, but every attempt to make money out of them has failed.<p>Also, they&#x27;re treated as a drug by regulatory bodies (which were established with pharmaceutical companies in mind), and so every phage strain, and every phage cocktail, would need extensive trials before approval is granted, despite their being completely safe and impossible to overdose on.<p>The practical reason for not using them is that antibiotics are trivial to administer compared to bacteriophage, you don&#x27;t need to identify the exact strain, and antibiotics are less of a problem to store.<p>However, when bacteria develop resistance to a particular phage, the phage can and will evolve to kill the new strain of bacteria.   Also, with phage therapy, dosage is not an issue as the phage multiplies on contact with its target bacteria.   Phage doesn&#x27;t mess with your gut flora.   And finally, nobody is allergic to phage.<p>The NHS and other health services should follow Georgia&#x27;s lead and develop stocks of phage (which are used at present to identify bacterial strains), as well as the expertise required to identify and administer them; fast-track them for use; and ignore any objections from pharmaceutical companies: the purpose is to cure people, not to make a profit.",1448152874

If you trust the source of the random seed, e.g. /dev/urandom, you may as well just use /dev/urandom itself. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re already in trouble.<p>I&#x27;d like to see actual benchmarks of /dev/urandom vs. a userspace PRNG before believing the argument that it&#x27;s too slow. Some people (I seem to recall Chromium does this) have done the benchmarks, <i>and</i> use enough random data that they implement their own userspace PRNG. Most applications don&#x27;t need it.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that getentropy() on OpenBSD and GNU/Linux recovers enough of the performance. The system call path is extremely fast, and the kernel isn&#x27;t doing random number generation any faster than you are -- unless you&#x27;re doing a bad job of it.<p>And if you somehow need a userspace PRNG, the usual advice about not rolling your own crypto unless you know what you&#x27;re doing applies. (Especially for database IDs, the risk of collisions should be considered a security problem, ergo this should be considered crypto, until proven otherwise.)

There are just so many vectors for tracking Web browsing behavior... literally hundreds. The only way to truly browse privately is behind a VPN or TOR from inside a virtual machine with no non-volatile storage so that everything is wiped between each VM execution.<p>Security is a legitimate concern, but the browser is already completely exposed since it downloads and runs arbitrary code all day long.<p>I do have some objection to WebRTC but it&#x27;s more architectural. WebRTC is overly complex, overly monolithic, and bloated. It tries to do too many things with one standard.",1448150470

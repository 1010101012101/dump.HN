27318,comment,27297,27298,0,0,benhoyt,,,"""Only run windows ... I'm probably the only one."" -- nup, me too. :-) What I was wondering, though, is whether the Windows version will have any quirks of the Mac one? In other words, presumably it'll be a useful test of how pages will look in Safari/Mac.<p>Must say, that resizable textbox feature is sweetness! I've seen that done with JavaScript before, but built into the browser -- cool.<p>It seems to use its own font-smoothing algorithm rather than the Windows one. Everything (including tiny fonts) are aliased, which at least on my laptop is not as clear.",1181591818

But it's another opinion with very different results.<p>Of course, a minute of research (on their respective ""adertise here"" pages), shows what is likely closest to the truth.<p>Mashable says they have 3mm page views.  TC has 4mm.<p>Mashable also focuses on social networks, while TC has a broader focus.",1181591709

27313,comment,27086,27086,0,0,eduardoflores,,,"In my opinion, Mono can make for linux what VB made for Windows: offer a simple-to-learn, simpler-to-use development environment, specially for the corporate world. Many managers prefer to use a ""manager-safe choice"" like windows/.net to risk on opensource platforms. I think VB was key to the windows commercial success and wide adoption on the mid-90's. Linux didn't had something like that in that time. Many desktop and web apps are being developed on .NET, and the possibility of running them on linux may give it a place it didn't had before. .NET might not be a good choice for a internet startup but it's certainly for corporate and desktop apps. And they can ride over MS marketing pushing the adoption of .NET.<p>Besides, .NET is a pretty good platform and Miguel and the community are doing an amazing job =)\n",1181590550

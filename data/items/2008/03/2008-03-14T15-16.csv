I just can't imagine that being the case in this instance.<p>I subscribe to the idea that when given the choice between 'clever' optimized code, and code which is instantly readable and maintainable, it's best to opt for the latter – unless you're trying to resolve an execution bottleneck.",1205510043

Whether you're bootstrapping or not, the best way to verify your concept AND position yourself to run a marathon is to FIND A CUSTOMER.  Putting a team together, launching, getting into yc, taking serious investment - these are all great milestones.

In fact, based on your advice, I reinstalled the Xcode Tools to be sure.<p>You're telling me that plain old tar should be missing, by default, on an OS X machine? I ended up taking tar and gnutar from a buddy's machine who did not have Xcode Tools installed. He's not a developer--he doesn't know what xcode is! He had both files from a clean install of his shiny new Leopard install disk.<p>It's not paranoia. You trust strangers in China? What's the downside to reinstalling? Maybe an hour? The upside is reduced risk of someone emptying out your bank account. For these factory workers, the contents of one US bank account might be 5-10 years pay. If you think this is paranoia, hope you don't manage any security functions. I think it's just being safe.",1205508999

We changed the wording to cover that which relates to actual work done for my employer, in effort to lessen the likelihood of them trying to claim something unrelated to their business. Our agreement explicitly assigns to me the ownership of the project I began before taking employment with them. Much better than the ""we own you and your mind"" approach.",1205508955

The progress that's been made on the problem has been tremendous over the past 10 or 20 years, but we still have a long way to go.  My hope, is that we do not figure out how galaxies form, instead, finding some new physics.<p>Anyhow, one highlight: By counting the same red galaxies you seen in sky's SDSS data, we have been able to measure the universal distribution of matter, and the change in ""size"" of the universe, through the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation.",1205508504

Of course, I can't be 100% sure this is why, because I interviewed for six hours, but it was the only part where I felt like I wasn't doing well.  I really fumbled at the whiteboard on some tree walking algorithms .  If I had reviewed my data structures and algorithms book, I would have rocked these questions.  What could have come off as a strong point instead came off as weak and rusty.<p>I do think that the company lost out on a good hire because of this.  The job requires some specialized math, as well as domain knowledge and programming ability.  I don't think there are many people will this skillset.<p>But next time, I will most definitely review this material prior to the interview, because it really cost me.",1205508393

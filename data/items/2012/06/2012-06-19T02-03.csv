It looks like something I did in high school, in one weekend. As good as the product might be, the site is not good marketing, no matter how you spin it. It's shoddy and lazy.

Web applications simply shift all difficult computation to the server and deliver the results straight to the client. As for client-side JS code, your point about the increased resource usage is correct, but moot for the next 5-10 years IMO. Hardware is going to follow Moore's law for a few years at the least, and as long as that happens, the efficiency simply isn't an important factor for most applications. History has shown that (at least as long as Moore's law holds) the tradeoff between developer time vs. running time is constantly shifted to favor developers.",1340074714

4129966,comment,4129636,4129636,4,0,JamesLeonis,,,"I can see several obsticles that will hamper the development of a fully web native environment. This is no way an exhaustive list, nor is it necessarily complete or correct within each item, so take it with a grain of salt...<p>1) Security. By default, the web is untrustworthy. This means we have to treat any incoming web page or application as if it were filled with digital anthrax. The browser quarantines the javascript and HTML. Likewise, the server providing the service has to treat the input from the client in the same way to protect against SQL attacks and other hacks. This limits the user to a whitelisted set of features that were deemed safe by the application's programmers. Apps have less restrictions, but the parent platform still imposes significant sandboxing to prevent malicious attack.<p>2) Platform. While the ecosystem for Apps and web applications is indeed varied, they depend on the complex abstraction of the underlying platform. In the case of the web and app platforms, this is the web browser and tablet/phone OSs. In the case of the latter, that means the developer is beholden to ""The Powers That Be"" in order to get their app accepted. This works better on the web, but to get that freedom we sacrifice access to the underlying OS because of the security problems.<p>3) Persistent Connection. There is no such thincluding contenting as an offline web app. While tablets/phones can enjoy a disconnected existence, most rely on the assumption of constant connectivity, which is no way guaranteed. I ran across this issue driving across Texas, where there are HOURS of no signal on the interstate 10.<p>4) Data ownership, persistence, and portability. This is a nebulous area that is very important for anybody dealing with intellectual property. Most websites TOS claim they own your pictures and content, and many apps either don't save or have a proprietary format that can't be accessed outside of itself. Portability and persistence are linked because we are dependent on these services to be always up. What happens when something crashes or the company goes under?<p>5) Money. Ultimately, servers and developers cost money. A service is a recurring cost. The user pays for this, one way or another, through subscriptions or advertisements. Apps can be immune to this if they are entirely independent of the internet to function, but there still would be a cost if only to support the developer.",1340073541

Then we had powerful desktops and lean servers because connectivity was expensive.<p>Now we have powerful desktops and extremely powerful servers because we want to be more connected to each other and don't have the resources to replicate the full set of data on every desktop (i.e. space and processing power (performing operations on that set of data) limitations). Give it some more time and the whole internet will become a peer-to-peer network (Diaspora, who the fuck knows what else). Give it even more time and we'll have huge servers again for unforseen reasons (oh how I wish I was a prophet).<p>Or maybe we'll realise that we're repeating the same pattern and come up with a completely novel concept upon one of the iterations terminating.

If you do have IT sponsorship for it, most companies are having to draw new lines around it rather than simply owning it like they historically did with Blackberries.  Examples: you have to pay for your own, it has to be managed by MDM and have wipe privileges, you will have to access all applications through VDI, etc.<p>That said, enterprises aren't thrilled end users can take them home and sync them with their own iTunes and mess with what IT has built on the tablets.

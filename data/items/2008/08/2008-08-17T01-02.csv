278109,comment,276657,276657,0,0,ggrot,,,"I can see that metadata about the movies becomes worthless, because there is already a wealth of data about each movie entity in the dataset.  However, metadata about the users should be fruitful since each user has fairly few data points to use for prediction.<p>Take for example two users who have each rated <i>only</i> Wall-E, and they both rated it a 5.  Now, given Jet Li's ""The One"", what prediction do you give for each user?  It is unlikely that two real people with this one data point on Wall-E would have the same outcome on ""The One"", so any additional data that can help to statistically separate the people can only help your case.  For example, is the person male/female?  What are the person's favorite genre's (something netflix collects), even things like did the person sign up for 6-at-a-time or 2-at-a-time might correlate slightly.",1218936855

Neither are hard or expensive to setup.<p>Until you have a proven and reliable service that adds value to business owners, I expect most people will opt for monthly billing. It helps with their cash flow and allows them to cancel at an earlier stage.<p>Hence, it is in your interest to try and achieve yearly lockdown whenever possible, even if this means a hefty discount (on the bright side, this also means less admin for you and long-term payment upfront). Once people start using your product, and if it services thier needs, they will be less inclined to leave, especially if they have invested time and energy in setting things ups and creating their workflow around the product.",1218935709

I track if there is an error in sending and I use a different mail relay if the message failed to send.<p>Centralizing the mail system has been a huge pain relief. I was sending mail out from each script that needed to send mail, now I have more control and a central point of failure if there is a problem. Plus I can schedule mail such as reminders that need to be sent off in the future.<p>I do mail this way because I work for a company that sends out there own mail and it is a huge hassle.  People click on the ""Spam"" button even on email technical support and billing receipt messages.  They just do not care.  I have spent hundreds of hours on mail over the last few years and would be pretty happy to never send one out myself though my own IP address.",1218935219

I'll certainly admit the possibility, but to say definitively that some things are simply unpredictable just seems too arrogant.<p>On the other hand, that has nothing to do with free will. Even if true randomness exists, and we suppose that even the ability to act randomly would not fall under most's definition of ""free will"".",1218935188

No one has filled the gap that VentureVoice left in my iPod. Text is okay, but it's not nearly as good for interviews.

71333,comment,71129,71306,0,0,alec,,,"It's a huge development aid - if you're running emacs and slime, you can reload individual functions or files with a quick key combo, and if you want code reload over multiple files, a reload function is easy to write - check times and you're off.  You can also do that with compiled code, too - instead of (load ""filename""), use (load (compile ""filename"")) and it'll be compiled.  The next time the functions are called, they'll use the new ones.<p>The tricky part is macros and inline functions.  Any time you change a macro or a function you want to inline (CL compilers can't do that automatically because of the language spec), you need to recompile all the functions that use that macro/inlined function.  ASDF has some dependency-tracking functionality, but I haven't used it.",1193098062

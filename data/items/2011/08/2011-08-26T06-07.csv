2927649,comment,2927000,2927495,1,0,dchuk,,,"I hear ya, but neither Stack Overflow nor Reddit are true forums. SO is a Q&A site format, and Reddit is affected by temporal ranking decay in a way different than traditional web forums and boards. Reddit and HN are essentially topic aggregators, which lend well to trends and current activity but not to long term forum discussions. I'm an active member of forums that have two or three year old threads that are still active on a daily basis. Because of the algorithmic ranking system of HN, Reddit, etc, you'll simply never get that.<p>I am honestly not doing too much to promote the forum other than posting it here and attempting to reply quickly to everything. A few dozen folks committing to the forum in the interest of getting it off the ground could easily start it moving forward momentum wise. I'm open to running ads somewhere to get traction, but there aren't many places I think that would be conducive to ads.<p>As for design, I just used one of the free themes available for MyBB. The homepage is very similar to many other forums online (such as anything powered by vbulletin). I can start looking around for themes that show more details/activity though.<p>I certainly appreciate your feedback and would love to incorporate as many updates and enhancements as possible to get things moving. Quite honestly, I would love for even just half a dozen people starting threads and answering replies and we can start to get the ball moving. After that, it should be able to grow fairly organically.<p>EDIT: I found this plugin that I will go ahead and install: <a href=""http://mods.mybb.com/view/recent-topics-on-index-page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mods.mybb.com/view/recent-topics-on-index-page</a> that will show recent threads on the home page.

It is the same in any regime, totalitarian or otherwise, that they have a mental block where it is inconceivable to them that anyone would have a legitimate reason to protest, that anyone would be disenfranchised enough to riot, that anyone would be disconnected from society to the point where they find it acceptable to loot. Just about every nation-state on Earth from Iran to Britain to the US is equal in this regard. Frankly I'm surprised this sort of thing doesn't happen more often, where 99.9% of humans have virtually no sovereignty at all.<p>Instead, all you get are law-and-order type responses.

It's more like the police getting a warrant to search a company's premises.<p>My thought process went a little like this...<p>Presumably the police could apply for a warrant to search RIM's premises for something along the lines of ""records of messages used to organise a riot""?  If they got that warrant, then they could go to the physical servers and search for the relevant data on site?  AFAIK that's a perfectly feasible scenario and completely within the law - even though RIM haven't committed any crimes, I think they can still be the subject of a warrant.  I'd guess something similar would happen in cases of fraud.<p>And if they can do that, then they could also ask RIM for permission to do it without a warrant.  Which RIM might agree to if they believe that the police would get the warrant anyway.<p>And if they can do that, then it doesn't sound much worse to give the records to the police for them to search through using their own computer systems instead of going and searching directly on RIM's servers.",1314340844

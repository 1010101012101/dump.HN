We received a DMCA notice a few weeks back that had the same notice, almost, ours said:<p><pre><code>    Dear Mark Smith:

    We have received a valid claim under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
    codified at 17 U.S.C. 512 (the ""DMCA""), that materials on your web server hosted

Note that it says that it could have already happened, and it's immediately hostile. Also, this notice DID NOT CONTAIN THE NOTIFICATION. I was concerned, as Dreamwidth has a fully functional DMCA policy and we pay people to manage DMCA complaints. We have a good team, fast turnaround, and obey the law.<p>I got on the phone with ServerBeach, and they flat out REFUSED to show me the DMCA notice. They said that it was a privacy issue, they could not show me the DMCA that was filed against my company. The notification they sent me included a random URL on my site -- but didn't tell me what content was actually  infringing.<p>I was told I had no choice but to take down content that was NOT infringing -- overbroadly censoring my user, HOPING that was enough to pacify the ServerBeach AUP team. I was not about to risk my business (we pay ~$8,000/month to ServerBeach) over one user's content.<p>But honestly -- that's a terrible position to be in. We're a site that believes strongly in fair use and transformative works. We have worked hard to fight for our users -- but if our host is fighting us... there's precious little we can do about the situation.<p>So -- be wary of ServerBeach.

Perhaps there's a better way for me to tune this?  Most of the data I store in redis is temporal so I don't mind losing it, but I do store stats for usage of features for reporting in my admin dashboard similar to how this article describes and that stuff i would like to keep around but if i lost a few hours or even a day i'm not going to lose sleep.<p>I should add, I also use redis to handle some pretty large calculations... zrange's for distance calculations intersections and so on... I did some benchmarking and found that at least in ruby (1.9.3), this was more efficient to load up redis for the sets and sorting, fewer GC hits and faster sorting intersecting...  I'm thinking it might be good if for these one off frequent compute tasks, I run on a redis instance that has no save, especially considering I expire/delete the keys immediately after running my calculations.",1350352530

Sometime in the last few years I stopped because I noticed I could find stuff from almost all the artists I was being recommended on Youtube and the like, and it was a quicker way to do on-demand listening of them than downloading a whole album.

It's that in order for a profession to be considered completely fair with regard to race and gender issues, the makeup of people in that profession must exactly reflect the proportion of people in the general population.<p>I would argue that this is a sufficient condition, but not a necessary one. Yes, for example, if it did happen to be the case that 50% of programmers were women and 50% of the general population were women, you could say there was no gender bias. But, I don't think that forcing a 50% ratio of women is the right way to go about eliminating the gender bias in the programming profession. It's also possible that there could be no bias, but the proportions would still not be equivalent to those in the general population for other, unrelated, reasons.<p>I'm not trying to pretend that such biases don't exist. I know they do. It's important that we go about eliminating them. It's also important that we do so by eliminating their causes, not by trying to artificially create scenarios that are coincident with a solution.<p>It's like, a symptom of the measles is having red dots all over your skin, and the proposed solution here is to cover them up with makeup.",1350352386

Take a look for yourself: www.FanUp.tv<p>We're both avid SCII players and huge fans of the e-sports scene. While watching streams we realized that the actual video portion of the stream was quite advanced, but the companion information wasn't. Chat is so 1992! We set out to better connect the streamer to his fans, and with v.1 we feel we've taken a step in the right direction.<p>Current Features: 
- Twitch AND Owned streams 
- Bnet integration 
- Twitter integration 
- Shout-o-meter (realtime display of fan up/down votes) 
- Liquidpedia profiles 
- Twitch/Owned chat<p>If you have feedback please do share! We've included a report issue button on the channel page should you notice an issue (incorrect Bnet, functional issues etc.). In the meantime enjoy. :)

4658045,comment,4657777,4657777,1,0,001sky,,,"The biggest point in this stands out as follows: The gatekeepers of ""Merit"" rely on <Hueristics> for selection.  They do this precisely because they do not know actual merit. Cue: Irony.  Applications to top-tier selective Universities, for example, are read for ~20 minutes. The reason they do not know actual merit, is a fundamental issue: Bounded Rationality.<p>The costs (in time, money, and brain damage) associated with ""factual"" merit testing would be rediculous/uneconomic. We can verify this somewhat orthogonally, by looking at a couple different similar selection processees. eg. Job interviews. Same problem, same solution. 20 min resume screens.  Next, we can compare a resource-unconstrained organization: How does it recruit top 1-5%'er? (special forces, test-pilots, and astronauts, etc): long, exhaustive, actual-failure-mode testing. No 20 minute skims.<p>If every job or educational credential was allocated in this manner (and you'd have to assume access to the test and test prep), it would be a more interesting test of ""Merit"".  As a second best, it would be interesting if schools actually failed out their weakest students (ie, proving that only the best had a credential).  But that is not how the world works. Merit is, rather, a politically correct (and practically expedient) heuristic for preferential treatment.  And that is the main point of this post, I believe.<p>The fair debate, of course, is on the resolution and applicability of filters under various contexts.

This is why I support affirmative action.</i><p>This is interesting, because it really does get down to the core of the argument: how do we improve the academic success of minorities?<p>Unfortunately, letting someone who can't do calculus into, say, Stanford, is not going to fix the fact that they will be WAY behind their peers. The psychological damage from this alone is tremendous. In fact, I believe there are some interesting studies done on this ""mismatch"" phenomenon, since racial minorities actually have a higher interest level in STEM careers, but are put at a disadvantage and become less likely to graduate as one due to being AA-ed into a student body where their capabilities are WAY below the mean of their classmates. This leads to an extremely high dropout rate which could have been avoided if they'd gone to a school that better suited their abilities. Instead, thanks to AA, the dropout rate for minorities in STEM departments is ridiculously high, and talented people who maybe just needed a less intense curriculum to adjust to instead end up becoming history or gender or racial studies majors or whatever major you can 4.0 in just for having a pulse.<p>Personally, whether it's harder or easier to do it at the pre-college level, I think it far wiser to leave the college admissions race-blind (to prevent discrimination) and focus on fixing the broken infrastructure that is failing our socioeconomically disadvantaged students.<p>That kid going to Stanford will do much better if he has AP calculus available at his high school, instead of just getting AA-ed in with an inferior skillset (which may or may not be their fault). We want people to be able to succeed, not set them up for failure. As a bonus, most people are fine with the idea of giving others an equal shot, but not so fine with the idea of race based discrimination. AA makes other groups resentful and suspicious of the AA-ed party, but helping people have equal access to preparation for college? Who's going to argue against that?<p>The best way to end discriminating on the basis of race is to <i>stop discriminating on the basis of race.</i>",1350351008

4657974,story,,,3,11,mansigandhi,"Ask HN: Cracking the Chicken-and-Egg Problem",,"We're a small startup that launched the beta version of our app at Stanford University 10 days ago (www.shoutt.me). Shoutt is a location-based information sharing platform...and thus, a social network of sorts. We decided to launch at Stanford due to various reasons like proximity to us, % of iPhone users, etc. We do plan to launch at more schools next semester, but right now we're stuck!<p>Being a social network, we face the classic chicken-and-egg problem. To overcome that and get users on board we did this: 
1. Have a very niche launch (Stanford) 
2. Run a competition where we give out a great prize every day for 30 days to the most active/creative user that day 
3. We distributed over 1500 flyers across dorms announcing Shoutt & the competition. You can see them here (http://shoutt.me/Marketing/)
4. Posted on student mailing lists about Shoutt and how it is useful
5. Emailed several student organizations about using Shoutt in a way to best benefit them as a group
6. Hired 3 undergrad students to help spread the word<p>What we are seeing right now is: 
1. Users are trickling in, growth is stagnant and not upwards
2. We do have a couple of evangelical users, but not many
3. After speaking with many students - we've realized that most are aware about the existance of Shoutt due to our initial push, but it iss passive knowledge.  There hasn't been much conversion from knowing to downloading.<p>It has been just 10 days, so it is still early...but we're not seeing as much traction as we'd like so we're starting to get worried. I was wondering if any of you had experience or tips to offer. Thanks guys!<p>What Shoutt does & how it is helpful:
Shoutt is a location-based app to share information with those around you. We're bringing the act of shoutting to the phone - when you shout only the people around you can hear you. This works as a great way to share information with students around you and thus helps connect hyperlocal communities. It can be used to connect places as small as a dorm or a department to as large as the entire campus/city - the distance is decided by the shoutter. Also, unlike other networks there are no friends or followers and is focused primarily on the shared information.<p>Shoutt can be applied to a wide range of scenarios -- Announcements (events, publicize, news), Collaboration (homework, study groups, hobbies), Marketplace (buy/sell, recruiting for orgs, help), Random chatter (updates, celebrating Cardinal victories) and Asks (ride shares, Freshmen questions).",1350349947

Its not ""conflating ability with opportunities"" anymore than it is saying ""there is learning by doing"" and since the  ""doing is not evenly distributed""[1], therefore neither is the ""learning"".[2]  Author is in part arguing that the only ""doing"" that matters is ""branded doing"" (ie, doing it for XYZ company or school), as as that is how the next level of doing is <i>rationed</i>, and there is therefore a recursive effect. This may or may not be a great argument, but I think its different than the one you allude to. In particular the low-threshold state and the (implied) recursive mechanism seem to have a more interesting dynamic.<p>______<p>[1] Or the option, etc.<p>[2] This depends on (or implies) a certain elemental/relative triviality of the task.",1350349425

It's human - nothing mean in it.<p>Why is Christophe Lemaitre one of the only decent white sprinters? Because. Why are boys dropping out more and more while girls study? Because. Why are there mostly asian in advanced classes, so much that some university (by their own words) do now discriminate against them in admissions? Because. Why are there mostly white men in the IT industry?<p>Well - I guess you can now answer yourself.<p>There is no conspiracy (except maybe for the universities preferring people from some ethnicities while other people are more qualified) - it's just a bunch of self maintaining tendency.<p>Something interesting - look at the posts on 9gag to try to get the current untold opinions - apparently some white people are developing an inferiority complex on math and sciences when they have asian classmates. Self exclusion, once again.<p>So drop the hatred and see the meritocracy. It's all around us.<p>For the first time in history, with a very low amount of capital and education, a human being can create a profitable company.

Part of the warning was that meritocracies can become both tautological and blind to corruption as the bits of paper become the main measure of the right to hold power.",1350349326

751270,comment,751039,751240,0,0,sachinag,,,"I've found that ""working harder"" is more accurate than saying ""working more productively"".  It's been my experience that many people get very excited about, say, rebuilding backends for incremental performance reasons (because they're good at it) rather than doing sales or marketing work (which isn't particularly fun).  Of course, you can have the world's most perfect backend, but if you don't have users, you're in a tree/forest situation.  It's the same 80 hours a week either way - but it's a more productive 80 hours if the founders are honest about what matters <i>at this moment</i> and what doesn't.<p>People enjoy working on the stuff they're good at.  A lot of times success comes from working on the stuff that you're not good at.  Rebuilding a backend sure can ""feel"" productive, but it often isn't the right decision for that moment.  That's why I prefer to think of it as working ""harder"" - it's a useful shorthand for ""don't neglect the stuff that sucks to work on"".  A need for revenue, based on a little higher cash burn, can often make the correct resource allocation decision more obvious.",1249850837

I disagree--programmers, like good musicians, are intensely creative people with a remarkable degree of technical ability. ""allow all creative people to build and create without code""? That's like saying ""allow all creative people to play songs and paint beautiful landscapes without having to strum guitar strings or wave paintbrushes around"". And as it turns out, that's possible--you can play other instruments, or draw with computer rendering tools, if you don't mind a slightly tone or a different ""look"", and still end up with good art. But good art is hard in and of itself.<p>Knowing how to express an idea in code is easy. It's easier as languages get more high-level but it's easy enough now. But knowing what ideas to express, and having ideas that are consistent enough, have the right tonality and the right balance and the right leanness to express, is the difficult part. Playing piano is about knowing what keys to hit, not how to hit the keys. Same with programming. If your fingers are too short, slow, and fat to play the piano, play trumpet.

You need a certain amount to live on to be able to work well.  But early on, when the company has no money, it is probably not a good idea to pay yourselves more than that minimum.  Later you can pay yourselves more.  But whatever you pay yourself, you're always doing it at the expense of the stock you hold.  This is obvious before the company is profitable, because the only way to get money to pay salaries is by selling stock.  But it is just as true after a company is profitable too.

It keeps people in jobs, and unfortunately keeps many creative thinkers out of the loop.  As it is, only programmers can write code effectively enought to produce innovative web sites and therefore, web companies that reinvent the web as we know it, and produce masses of wealth.  If we did not use code, not only could we be more efficient with producing these websites, becasue we would not be also producing even greater code errors, and via numerous different types of code that are all used for different things and are not designed to work well together, becasue the programmer wants to keep a monopoly on it, but all creative thinkers that have brilliant ideas on how to utilize software and the web to better the world, and the worlds of business and technology, will be also to contribute their ideas.  The bottom line is that tyically, the most creative people are those whom are natural artists. But these artists arenot techies, and therefore cannot translate their creative ideas to the web or software without including the mind of a programmer.  This goes for anyone with a great idea.  If you have a great idea for software or the web, but then partner with a programmer to carryout your ideas.  Make sure you stay on top of your game.  Because just like when a story gets passed along through many people, when your idea gets translated into code from someone else, there is a lot of room for error and distortion.  Just as it is when a programmer is forced to deal with numerous different programming languages just to express what they want to create.  Errors occur.  As youtube and digg have both cut out the middleman in video media and news, and allow the consumer to make the choice as to what they like, why not cut out the middle man(main stream media, or programming), and allow all creative people to build and create without code, but via a universal point and click type program?

""We're open"" becomes just misdirection and fake hype.<p>But I think that's the least of Wave's problems at the moment. If they get the server bugs worked out, and figure out access control, then we can start talking about interoperability.",1249848103

The strength of one's restraint is measured against the strength's of one's desires.  You improve results by strengthening restraint and weakening appetite.<p>I see self-restraint as a limited amount of discretion that a person has to override his natural tendency to maximize emotional reward.  As the article says, self-restraint is tiring and unnatural; it's a stopgap measure at best.  The primary conflict is in your emotional brain's cost/benefit analysis of the situation.  You have to hack your emotional reward system so you don't have to employ as much self-restraint.  When you naturally derive satisfaction from eating well, because you have faith in the ultimate payoff, your natural tendency will not be as strongly tilted in favor of overeating.<p>Your subconscious/emotional/whatever brain is smarter than most people think.  You aren't doomed to have an out-of-touch brain that fills you with irresistible, self-destructive impulses to overeat.  We may have evolved on the savannah, but if you can stand on a subway platform, surrounded by strangers whose personal feelings about you are unknown, waiting for a huge steel structure to come whizzing by you at high speed, <i>without feeling scared</i>, you can learn to leave food on your plate.  You just have to program your brain properly (cultivate faith) so that you feel, subconsciously, that limiting your eating leads to well-being and happiness (and, according to the highly publicized recent study, more sex if you're a man.)",1249848021

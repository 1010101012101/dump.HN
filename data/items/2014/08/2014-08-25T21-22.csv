However, some level of incentive would still need to be kept, otherwise the spike of car charging would just be shifted to 1800-2000, when everyone gets home and plugs in.<p>And really, the aluminum smelters was just one example. As the nightly price equalized with the daily price, all electricity would begin getting more expensive, and everything else with it.

8224388,comment,8222652,8224125,14,0,fabulist,,,"> If I were to screw you, I can very well do it with an open source product and pre-compiled binaries.<p>This is even easier to do to closed-source products, and if you&#x27;re worried about security than compiling your own binaries is a pretty basic measure.<p>It is not just that open source software is inherently more trustworthy than closed source software.<p>1. It is more resistant to backdoor attacks (related to trustworthiness) and more effectively hardened. Fundamental to security is transparency. You cannot secure something if you cannot understand its attack surface; insecure undocumented features (ie the recent iPhone discoveries[1]) and binaries accidentally (or &quot;accidentally&quot;) compiled with debug flags are only detectable if the source is available.<p>2. It is often more nimble and can respond to new threats which closed-source projects ignore. At my work, we were hit by as USB virus that McCaffe ignored despite our very premium support plan because it didn&#x27;t exist anywhere else. This was before my time, but from my understanding it was a custom-tailored attack that was made in a virus creator -- a drag-and-drop not-so-advanced persistent threat. (Probably a prank or experiment; I work at a school.) If we used open source software, and the community shrugged at us, we could at least make our own signature. At it was, we had to bring the computers down one at a time, boot them into Linux, and run a script to delete the files and registry keys. This is the job antivirus software is meant to automate. I understand virus companies have a heavy workload, but what exactly were we paying for? With open source, you always get your monies worth. (For the software at least; open source support plans can still suck.)<p>3. Appsec is expensive, its not always something you can afford to pay for. If you aren&#x27;t designing with security in mind from the start, its not just a feature you can build into your app. It will require pentests and likely a partial rewrite. On an open source project, theres a good chance someone will volunteer to close at least the widest holes. No one volunteers for closed source.<p>4. This is likely not a part of your threat model, but its harder to serve an open source project with a national security letter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/23/iphone-backdoors-surveillance-forensic-services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/23/iphone-bac...</a>",1409003090

8224351,comment,8223448,8223612,23,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The politics are complicated; I have several friends who are working archaeologists in the western US and it is a frequent topic of conversation. Since Kennewick Man, there have been a few other extremely old archaeological sites discovered in the same region of North America that support the hypothesis that a different people occupied these parts of North America at one time. The politics are approximately as follows:<p>The tribes are given enormous legal latitude and power on the basis that they are residing on their ancestral lands since the beginning of time. This is a working legal assumption absent evidence to the contrary. The Corps of Engineers, Department of Interior, et al need to operate with the consent of the tribes for many parts of their job.<p>The tribes sometimes use this relationship as leverage to gain a variety of concessions out of the government. The Corps of Engineers needs a good working relationship with the tribes as a practical matter or it makes their job very difficult.<p>Herein lies the conflict: any scientific evidence that the tribes are not in their ancestral lands undermines their political leverage and so they actively attempt to suppress scientific inquiries that may undermine them. The Corps of Engineers and other government organizations that need the permission of tribes to operate are strongly encouraged by the tribes to maintain the status quo or the tribes will make life difficult for them. It is a clear conflict of interest.<p>In summary, the tribes have a political and financial incentive to suppress any evidence that they were not the first occupants of their land, and they have the leverage in some parts of government to use the government as their agents to enforce that perspective. Consequently, and unfortunately, a lot of archaeological evidence is quietly destroyed or unreported in that part of the country to avoid being held hostage by the tribes.",1409002501

Also, I did not approach Google, their recruiter contacted me based on my rapidly growing list of successes on my resume.<p>But in the end, I&#x27;m glad they didn&#x27;t offer my the position, because after reflection, it was really just the prestige of working for Google that drew me to even consider an offer from them, when the smaller, more agile and more innovative atmosphere of a start-up is far more in-tune with my skillset and mentality.<p>And while there is no in-house laundry, so I can literally live in my &quot;open office&quot; without the bother of ever leaving work, I do have a few things in which I don&#x27;t imagine I would find at Google, namely: A good work/life balance, an innovative atmosphere with little bureaucratic inertia and most importantly, a warm feeling when I&#x27;m driving to work in the morning.<p>In the end, I think it&#x27;s google&#x27;s policy of &quot;Let&#x27;s get the best, forget the rest&quot; that is slowly taking them from &quot;Do no Evil, be a cool place to work at&quot; to &quot;stuffy, sterile, homogeneous corporate environment&quot;.

8224236,comment,8222017,8223897,1,0,scoofy,,,"Well, the issue you point to here is the flux of language, which is a real problem. There is no &quot;English,&quot; we have no academy like they do for French (which is bullshit anyway), and we never will, and it would be impossible. There is just a series of languages each wholly understood only by the speaker, and perhaps people in the immediate culture of the speaker.<p>Now, this is sort of a problem, but it&#x27;s not as though we are walking around confused all day. We make it work, we formalize, we come up with a perscriptivist framework, even if we live in a decriptivist world.<p>We can do this with any issue brought up with being verb &quot;problems.&quot; Our Julius Caesar issue is fixed by a simple convention (yes we have conventions in English as we do in formal languages). Getting people to follow the rules is the only problem, and it will eventually fail, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t have a few hundred years of it working, possibly more.<p>The issue of practicality is an entirely different question. Currently, it&#x27;s an absurd proposition, that isn&#x27;t to say however, that it isn&#x27;t doable. Especially with greater computational power in the future. I think saying it&#x27;s impractical is a cop out. The amount of energy that goes into learning languages is immense. If we were able to learn one syntax, nearly identical to English, that could convert instructions into readable code, we&#x27;d enter a renaissance of programming akin to art after the photograph was invented, or the current renaissance of music we&#x27;ve created with the invention of the synthesizer and sampler. Skill would evaporate, ideas would reign.

If you have any familiarity with current events in East Asia, you&#x27;ll know that nationalism is on the rise.<p>On a related note, did you not read this portion of my comment? &quot;I&#x27;m guessing (and hoping) that most naturalized US citizens are way more loyal than that and I feel that Chinese Americans born and raised in the US don&#x27;t have this issue at all.&quot; Everything isn&#x27;t black and white.<p>> You can, rather, look at this from the perspective of arguing parents, where they want you to pick one or the other. The only way to win is to not play, and to derive identity from your self, rather than what patch of dirt you happened to be born upon.<p>There are multiple problems with this analogy. 1. You only get the 3rd choice if you&#x27;re willing not to live in either parent&#x27;s house when we&#x27;re talking countries.\n2. Another problem is that you&#x27;re looking at this from a Western perspective. In the East, especially in Asia; you derive your identify more from the group and not the individual; so if you consider yourself more &#x27;Chinese&#x27; than &#x27;American&#x27;, you&#x27;re going to symphatize more with one side.

Do you call that &quot;open source&quot; or do you prefer a different label?<p>The difference is less entangled in the free software philosophy. You have the freedom to develop code for yourself and distribute it, and to ignore contributions.

LLVM IR is close to C semantics (though aliasing information has to be supplied explicitly), but you have direct control over debug info, which is important to avoid a huge regression in the debugging experience. As an added bonus, you eliminate the necessity of serializing and deserializing your IR during your compilation pipeline for no reason (which is effectively what compiling and reparsing C is doing).",1454876507

Those people you&#x27;re talking about are suffering from <i>crime</i>.  The problem is not police brutality--the problem is crime.

That is a stone age attitude if I ever heard one.

The right to vote is firmly protected (as for voter ID laws, I think they&#x27;re very reasonable). Racial-based government policy making is prohibited. This prohibition is enforced except for in cases where the discrimination helps minorities.  Private discrimination is a serious legal issue, sometimes pursued to the point of absurdity.  The current shakedown of the car loan industry over racial discrimination is a good example, and many other cases pursued under the doctrine of &quot;disparate impact&quot;.  We don&#x27;t hose down peaceful protesters anymore either, and even in the 60s that was appalling to people outside of the South.  The contrast between Birmingham in 1963 and Ferguson in 2014 is instructive.<p>The War on Drugs is disproportionately hurting minorities, and I think it&#x27;s a terrible policy on many counts, but I don&#x27;t think you can frame it as the machinery of minority oppression.<p>The welfare state is definitely hurting minorities, but again, I think it&#x27;s just bad policy-making, not intentional subjugation.<p>EDIT: Responding to fnovd here, because Hacker News is throttling me:<p>I happen to think that people should be free to put whatever they want into their bodies.

If minorities are more likely to steal cars, and more likely to end up in jail because they were stealing cars, or more likely to be poor because their dad was in jail for stealing cars, or more likely to sucked into stealing cars because it&#x27;s an easy source of profit in a poor neighborhood, that doesn&#x27;t make banning stealing cars a racist policy.",1454875271

I said nothing about the relative value of a 2 hour meeting with a financial planner, I am only stating the fact that you are unlikely to find any &quot;fee-only&quot; planner who will work with you for $150. I&#x27;d be happy to be proven wrong by someone who is actually doing it.<p>As my own counter example I know someone who did exactly as you suggested. A one time meeting with an advisor to review his portfolio and asset allocation but invests for himself online. It took about 2 hours and cost $500 and didn&#x27;t include any detailed financial planning (e.g., taxes, retirement projections, etc.) it was simply a portfolio review.<p>So even using the lowest and simplest example I could find the cost is much higher than suggested. Additionally, I was also told this advisor was fairly reluctant to even offer this. This, generally speaking, just isn&#x27;t their model. Even in the fee-only market they are typically looking to work with people on an ongoing basis, not one off.<p>As a more general example, in Canada some people work with &quot;money coaches&quot; who focus more on financial planning, saving habits, debt consolidation, retirement income planning, etc. They charge around $1-2k for a four meeting package. My understanding is that these prices are similar in the US but I could be wrong.<p>The bottom line here is that I&#x27;m just not aware of a market of financial advisors charging one time fees anywhere near $150. That&#x27;s just how it is.<p>>> I get the sense that there are many in this thread who are either in the industry...<p>I suppose finance must be the one industry where people outside of it know much more than those in it.",1454875259

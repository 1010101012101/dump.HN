77153,comment,77005,77005,0,0,axod,,,"I'd agree about applets. They look ugly in the main, trying to make them not look ugly and out of place is very hard.
Startup time is very slow, and they do stick out like a sore thumb saying ""1990s! 1990s!""<p>If a website is slow, and looks ugly users are going to be less likely to use it.",1194472400

77151,comment,77004,77145,0,0,edw519,,,"Sorry.  In major league baseball, the pitcher is often a terrible hitter, easy to strike out.  ""Striking out the pitcher"" means doing the easy thing that almost anyone can do instead of focusing on the real problem (in the baseball analogy: striking out the good hitters).",1194472140

Better-quality search results was a technical advancement for Google, but I wouldn't say this is quite of the same nature.<p>No doubt it's a beautiful plan, but unlike the Brin-Page paper, the ideas behind this has been around for a good while. There are plenty of ideas from research that can be similarly incorporated into a stronger advertising machine. For example, variable interval reinforcement is the most effective conditioning paradigm, which would be very useful  for advertisers. It's fairly well-known, but not many companies are in a position to employ it.",1194471914

77148,comment,76630,76956,0,0,mrtron,,,"I hate 'arguing' this way, but no it is not.
Straw man:
Presenting someone who defends a position poorly as the defender, refute that person's arguments, and pretend that every upholder of that position, and thus the position itself, has been defeated.<p>He was presenting me as someone who had no experience with a startup, thus shooting down my arguments about the ease of starting up.  Explain how this is incorrect?
He presents me as an individual with no experience with startups.  He then uses that to attempt to shoot down my arguments.",1194471475
77147,comment,77125,77125,0,0,imperator,,,"On Craigslist. I put an ad up about my current company and that I was looking for a cofounder. I was contacted by two people. I contacted the first, but he never messaged me back.  I corresponded with the second for a bit, and after a few emails we realized we had met before at a hacker party called Super Happy Dev House. We met for lunch, and the rest is history.<p>You should come to the next Devhouse <a href=""http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse21</a>.

You can also do some XML/XSLT/XHTML stuff, or you can load and pre-cache in the background, which might be your best bet. Depends on your architecture and what you are trying to accomplish. I've used all of the above. I'm sure there are lots more options.",1194470913

77142,comment,77004,77137,0,0,edw519,,,"Smaller variables to have less going down the line?  Sounds like striking out the pitcher to me.<p>One of my constant struggles has been where to build HTML that has to be built on the fly, server or client?  On the server, lots more bytes to ship down the line but less javascript to run once it gets there.  On the client, 10% as much data to send, but then lots of javascript to run to assemble the HTML.  Anyone else ever struggle with this problem?",1194470383

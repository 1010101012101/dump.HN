I still use a lot of the surrounding features of the social sites when checking updates - it's usually done such that I can quickly respond to something and not have to log in during the switch from finding out and responding.<p>What about customization?  Can I change the look of the site to mirror maybe one of those services or something I would prefer?  I say this mostly because a lot of those services listed offer that ability and it is well used by many users with accounts on those other sites.<p>Still, I like it, kind of like a google feadburner for social sites.  Actually, what different are you doing other than an rss/atom aggregator?<p>If I could use those accounts from your site I would probably use it more often than all the others.  Even with minimal functionality of use imported from those other sites.",1189562206

53676,comment,53600,53600,0,0,german,,,"I agree in that version 1 looks much better, maybe because of the picture.
I think it would look better using version 1 image and tag line with the learn more and join now! links.<p>About design, you should change the headers hover background color (I just can't read the text when it's hovered).
One last thing, don't use the stile tag in HTML elements, that kind of code is very difficult to maintain, use your stylesheet instead.<p>Congratulations about your site!  ",1189561596

No one wants to be pushed aside for someone's hobby. <p>That said, your relationship probably has to be serious too. Sometimes you're not going to have time for her. She has to understand that you can still be ""working"" even though your day job ended four hours ago. <p>Don't keep her in the dark. Show her the things you're working on. If she starts snoring don't assume it's because she isn't your audience: maybe what you're doing is genuinely boring. <p>Start joking about the things you'll buy when you're millionaires. <p>I'm in a serious relationship. I haven't started a startup yet. But the same issues have come up as I learn how to hack. <p>*I'm still looking for a hacker friend in Kansas City (are you one? dgouch at gmail.com)",1189560007

Here's a video clip I shot in 2005 of carp jumping around a boat on the Mississippi.  (I'm the one holding the camera.)  We tinkered with plans to build a fish-catcher to tow behind the boat and scoop them up but couldn't get past the problem of what then to do with tons of carp.

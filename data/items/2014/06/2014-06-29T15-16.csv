7961467,comment,7960762,7961352,3,0,srean,,,"You are assuming that Python code executes the same way that a C code does. There is a whole lot more going on in a Python execution, so intuition drawn from C does not apply line by line to Python code. You have to think in terms of Python bytecode and think about how that byte code is interpreted by CPython. You have to think about the fact that Python is dynamic so for every value it also has to look up the type. But then I would not have known all this when I was 17, not even the C execution model, so keep hacking.<p>In fact I redid my tests and <i>reduce</i> is actually consistently faster than the <i>for loop</i>. Not by much but always faster (by that I mean the minimum of 10 runs of reduce is faster than the minimum of 10 runs of for loop.

But Julia has nothing close to the standard library + ecosystem that Python does, and probably won&#x27;t for a long time if it ever does; and while Go is coming along in that regard, there are some aspects that make it less preferable to Python, especially JITed Python with software transactional memory (i.e. no GIL).

If you&#x27;re shooting in a studio now, you can cycle out all the iPhone shots, which are contributing to a kind of &quot;man-of-the-people candy blog&quot; vibe, versus a &quot;place that will send me awesome candy&quot; vibe.<p>Images like this: <a href=""http://www.japanstyle.info/wordpress/wp-content/images//20110908_ame01.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japanstyle.info/wordpress/wp-content/images//2011...</a> make me curious and hungry, images like this: <a href=""http://www.candyjapan.com/static/japanese-candy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.candyjapan.com/static/japanese-candy.jpg</a> remind me of being told to check Halloween candy for razors.<p>- Lead with the photography. Right now, if I don&#x27;t already have an idea of what &quot;japanese candy&quot; is, I&#x27;m not excited. It&#x27;s cliche, but even just changing the title text to lightly shadowed white and sticking full-width high quality candy photos behind it in a carousel would be way more engaging.<p>- Consider folding the &quot;Are you still active?&quot; section into the title pitch. If this is a concern people have, you don&#x27;t want them to have to scroll through the rest of the page to resolve it. Could be worth testing something like &quot;Order now to be included in the July 15th shipment!&quot;.<p>- A more broad observation: The service (including the totally adorable &quot;how it works&quot; comic strip) seems to be pitched heavily towards something like American Otaku culture. In my experience, though, classmates would define social groups around being into manga, or wanting to learn Japanese-- but when a classmate would come back from Japan with some never-before-seen candy, <i>everyone</i> was excited.<p>That&#x27;s just my take, anyway.

7961447,comment,7961143,7961414,5,0,_delirium,,,"I also don&#x27;t get the criticism of analogies to older technologies. When faced with applying a statute to new technologies, where the intended application to old technologies is clear but the application to a new one isn&#x27;t, discussing which older technologies are relevant analogies is a useful way to proceed. In this case it&#x27;s clear that Congress did not intend the Copyright Act to cover rental of home A/V equipment, but <i>did</i> intend it to cover the 1970s community-antenna systems. So it seems pretty natural to ask: is Aereo&#x27;s service, in the relevant features, more like CATV or more like equipment rental? The court might&#x27;ve gotten the answer to that wrong, but it seems like the right question to ask. At least, absent Congress actually updating the law to clarify how <i>they</i> want it applied to new technologies. I&#x27;ve read through the opinion and I don&#x27;t see anything <i>technological</i> to disagree with there. They correctly described how the system operates; the only real disagreement is over whether the Copyright Act was intended to cover a system operating in such a manner.<p>Now at oral argument they sometimes use pretty out-there analogies, but some of that is trying to probe the limits of what an attorney for one side or the other is arguing.

That just never seemed to be a likely possibility.<p>That is no longer true, people even make money selling RPGMaker games (e.g. the Aveyond series [1]).

I&#x27;m going to ignore the aggressive undertone in your comment for the sake of the conversation.<p>A vector of elements is contiguous in (virtual) memory. An addition operation takes one single cycle on most, if not all, CPUs, given that the values are available. Since memory access is orders of magnitude slower than this CPU operation, your runtime here will be dominated by the time you need to get the values from memory.<p>In this case, you want to make your memory access patterns as predictable as possible, to hit as much cache as you can. Sequential iteration over a contiguous block of memory is the most cache-friendly memory access pattern. You may incur some penalties when you hit page boundaries and jump to another page somewhere else in physical memory, but you can&#x27;t do better than that.<p>Divide-and-conquer non-obviously jumps between vector elements, and, depending on the size of the vector, it will miss the cache more often than the ordinary loop iteration algo. I imagine the first version would be as fast as the last one if TCO was in effect... but it wasn&#x27;t.<p>Using reduce (which proved to be significantly faster than the first couple algos) does the same, but it incurs an overhead within the Python interpreter from calling the lambda. Yes, unlike other methods, it may be parallelized, but it won&#x27;t help much because RAM is shared across cores, and waiting time for it will still dominate the runtime.<p>&quot;Non-obvious&quot; algorithms can shine when they reduce the problem&#x27;s big O cost (going from O(n^2) insertion sort to O(n log n) quicksort) and/or the CPU time dominates the real time (opening the door for parallelization). But when you&#x27;re memory-bound it simply doesn&#x27;t help. A plain old loop will be faster (or as fast).<p>So I&#x27;m not a &quot;surprised expert&quot;. I don&#x27;t think of myself as an expert as I have zero formal education in CS or programming or whatever. Maybe this is obvious to me because I am used to writing C/C++ code, or maybe because I think a lot about how programs really work &quot;on the inside&quot;.

It has nothing do with there being more GUI-type things in there - I have things like save-icons etc. turned off. It just feels more like it&#x27;s own application in GUI mode (if I run it in terminal mode, the Meta hotkey doesn&#x27;t work as usual, which I suspect is because the terminal is using the alt-key (meta) for something else and so it overrides that hotkey). Why should I prefer to use Emacs in terminal mode? I am honestly open to changing my mind.",1404054489

For example a Brazilian coder might write<p>país = &quot;Brasil&quot;<p>Without the accent, pais means fathers rather than country.<p>Imagine how constraining it would be to code in a language that disallowed vowels in identifiers (perhaps because it had been designed by Hebrew speakers).

7961346,comment,7960779,7960779,7,0,manish_gill,,,"I spent this entire weekend setting up Evil mode for Emacs, in the Emacs Starter Kit package. It&#x27;s been decent so far. Evil mode is surprisingly good, and I really don&#x27;t think it could come any closer to vim emulation for Emacs. Took a lot of googling around to set up some basic plugins that I need - projectile for CtrlP etc. I think the only thing that I need atm is Magit integration with Evil and I&#x27;ll be good to go.<p>What has been amazing so far is that even after using vim for almost 3 years, I&#x27;d been sort of afraid of diving deep into the config system (I made do with copy-pasting some popular vimrc files) and it was good enough, but in the short span of 2 days, I&#x27;ve actually gotten to know more about emacs configuration style than I ever did about vim. And I suspect it will only get better as I start to learn Emacs Lisp.",1404054304

5497,comment,5482,5482,0,0,volida,,,"zaidf, amichail<p>the thing is that most of the time you don't care. But there are times that suddenly you become aware of it, and if its one of the times that it annoys you then it strikes you, and thats when you need maybe somebody to either support you (the case of someone who is active part in the early process of starting up) or fulfil it before it becomes a need. And as always you must get over it",1174510091
5494,comment,5482,5482,0,0,pg,,,"I believe it.  Oddly enough, it's lonely even when there are a couple of you.  This is one of the main reasons we do YC in batches.  The startups all become one another's friends, because they're all in the same situation.  <p>I think it's well worth the inconvenience of moving in order to have a large group of energetic and sympathetic peers.  That's the deal with college, after all.",1174509868

5492,comment,5458,5458,0,0,notabel,,,"I think Metaweb is the only big name currently betting itself on the Semantic Web, though in a way that might let it route around some of the problems.  For most other startups, the semantic web is a possible benefit, but not a necessity.  Opportunistic utilization of semantic web tech can certainly benefit most web startups; the entire vision doesn't have to fly for us to derive some of the benefits.",1174509720

Step 1 is to start meeting SOMEWHAT partner-ish people and college is a good start from my experience.\n",1174509543
5490,comment,5482,5482,0,0,zkinion,,,"Most founders with families in the startup stage of business don't see them that much anyways.  Plus you have to network alot so you're always seeing people.  <p>However, there would be a lacking of intimate contact.  You can bond with other founders but that only goes so far.  Society as a whole is becoming increasingly isolated.  Many people have hundreds of friends on their ""friendspace/mybook"", but deep down have no one to really confide in.  ",1174509121

5479,comment,5474,5475,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Many startups already let you do this, if you find them on launch.  news.ycombinator's a good example: it was incredibly bare-bones from the beginning, and you've been able to watch it grow.  If you were into Reddit at the beginning, you got to see that one evolve too.<p>A lot of the work in starting up a startup involves mundane things like setting up servers, version control, feedback links, testing, etc.  There's really nothing to <i>see</i> there.<p>I'm tempted to open up my Subversion repository eventually (I started checking into svn after 1.5 weeks, when the app was basically nothing more than a login page), but I can't really do that until:<p>a.) We've launched, so that we actually gain any of the publicity benefits of being an ""open"" startup<p>b.) We have enough of a technological lead that it wouldn't be disastrous to have someone download the svn repository and immediately setup a clone.  LiveJournal, for example, has gotten about zero leverage out of being open-source and had to deal with some fairly significant hassles.",1174507822

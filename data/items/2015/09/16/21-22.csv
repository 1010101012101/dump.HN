Does this include an audit of the source for that compiler and/or the path that the compiler source or compiler binaries take to their destination?<p>No, the important bit to realise about DDC is that you don&#x27;t need a compiler you know to be trusted (otherwise, of course, there would be no point). You take two different compilers, and you just have to trust that they don&#x27;t both contain the same backdoor.<p>The most concise description I&#x27;ve seen is in Bruce Schneier&#x27;s writeup. Quoting him:<p>Suppose we have two completely independent compilers: A and T. More specifically, we have source code SA of compiler A, and executable code EA and ET. We want to determine if the binary of compiler A -- EA -- contains this trusting trust attack.<p>Step 1: Compile SA with EA, yielding new executable X.<p>Step 2: Compile SA with ET, yielding new executable Y.<p>Since X and Y were generated by two different compilers, they should have different binary code but be functionally equivalent. So far, so good. Now:<p>Step 3: Compile SA with X, yielding new executable V.<p>Step 4: Compile SA with Y, yielding new executable W.<p>Since X and Y are functionally equivalent, V and W should be bit-for-bit equivalent.",1442440646

However, the fundamental point you&#x27;re missing is that I don&#x27;t think that Windows was ever positioned as this OS that was designed for every single type of workload out there (not withstanding marketing noise). Windows is a very general purpose OS meant for general purpose &#x27;mainstream&#x27; things. Things that hundreds of millions of people might want to do. Specialty workloads are simply not what Microsoft is ever going to invest any significant amount of time in - unless they see some money there. In that sense, Windows would probably be a far better OS if users could modify it to suit their needs, but thems the breaks. Linux seems to fill that void for some.<p>The disadvantage of NTFS which you point out, isn&#x27;t because of a fuckup. It&#x27;s not designed for your use case.

From what I&#x27;ve read in the blog posts the team wants to prioritize ES6 (ES2015) features first, particularly as async/await is potentially on the standards agenda as early as ES2016 or ES2017...<p>The surprise in TypeScript 1.6 is that experimental support for async/await is actually included, with the caveats that you have to explicitly opt in to the experimental feature with a compiler flag and that it only works when outputting ES6 code (it fails for ES3 and ES5). Some details are at the bottom of the issue 1664.<p>Also, I think the new typing capabilities are hugely sexy if you&#x27;ve ever had to write .d.ts files for wild JS. Generic type aliases and intersection types will solve a lot of things that were much harder to do in definition files previously.<p>Also, the support for expressions in class extends clauses makes it a lot easier to use the nicer class syntax when operating with JS libraries that use a custom object factory. (Given the long history of JS OO, there are a lot of weird custom object factories out there in wild JS code.) This is also good catchup with ES6 class syntax; it&#x27;s always sexy when TS works to keep its &quot;pure superset&quot; goals.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap</a>",1442439970

10230120,comment,10225903,10229436,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Most of my work involves kernel programming (device drivers for hardware or virtualisation companies etc.); almost all of the rest of it is writing networking code (custom protocol implementations). So my reasons for evaluating[1] Rust are that I think C and C++ are pretty awful languages for writing code that&#x27;s as security and reliability critical as the code I touch on a day to day basis, while memory-managed languages aren&#x27;t even on the menu for me - kernel hacking is a fairly unpopular niche, and I&#x27;m used to it being ignored in terms of programming language and library design. My opinions/statements below are primarily centred around this set of use cases:<p>* There is little practical difference between regular threads and green threads in an OS kernel. Most OSes can&#x27;t handle it if you manually mess with the stack in a kernel context anyway. (thread records are typically accessed by rounding the current stack pointer) So if you want to do synchronous-style I/O with real stacks, you&#x27;ll need an OS thread for each task.<p>* Kernel thread stacks are fairly small; 8-16KiB are typical. The reason for this is of course that kernel stacks must use wired (non-pageable) memory, or interrupts will irrecoverably page fault. 8-16KiB is much too small for buffers of course, but also <i>enormous</i> compared to the actual amount of non-buffer state for most I/O tasks. In any case, you never ever want to get too close to utilising the theoretical maximum as you risk crashing the system. So for every kernel thread you create, you know you&#x27;re wasting precious wired memory. Obviously, this is true for threads created from userspace too, but in the kernel, people usually don&#x27;t have a choice about running your code, so you try to be as good a citizen as possible, and not fire off hundreds of threads.<p>* In many contexts, dynamic memory allocations are not reliable, and allocation failure must not impede progress. (I.e. I can&#x27;t wait for the system to page some memory out to disk if my code is on the critical path for disk I/O.) So typically, it is desirable to pre-allocate enough memory to keep all the state required for a sequence of operations from start to finish. It&#x27;s even less likely you can just spin up a new thread; so the threaded approach implies keeping a pool of threads around which is guaranteed to be big enough. A.k.a. a waste of resources.<p>* The chain-of-callbacks approach to I/O is even more awful in languages and environments with manually managed memory and resources.<p>* If I&#x27;m going to pick a fancy new language to write my drivers in, I&#x27;m still going to have to use the custom alloc/free functions for each type of kernel object (network packet, etc.) that the OS I&#x27;m writing against happens to use.<p>So typically, you end up either splitting your code into a bunch of callbacks, or you create a complicated explicit state machine with a giant dispatch switch() statement. In both cases all state tracked in a giant struct. Keeping track of control flow is tricky. Maintaining invariants is tricky. Making sure you don&#x27;t leak (or over-free, or use-after-free) any of the resources you touch is tricky.<p>It&#x27;d be really, <i>really</i> nice if the language could help you out with this. Write it as synchronous code, and the compiler turns each location where execution can be suspended into a callback function. The locals that are used across suspension points are stored in an automatically generated struct (bonus points: unions for state which is guaranteed to not have overlapping lifetimes) which can be preallocated before firing off the &quot;task&quot; in question. As far as I&#x27;m aware, such a code transformation would effectively be a CPS-transform, (continuation passing style) which has at least been researched quite a bit in theory, if not so much in non-GC-language practice.<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to invest large amounts of time into really learning Rust and applying it to my use case in earnest. It&#x27;s tough without a remotely compliant standard C library around, and I&#x27;ve struggled a bit with trying to pick and choose bits out of Rust&#x27;s &#x27;core&#x27; library without bringing on an avalanche of dependencies. (any kernel module code is kept in wired memory, so unused code is a waste of resources in the kernel) I&#x27;m determined to overcome that though and use Rust for something other than a toy kernel module, and see if and how it improves things over C. If Rust does start supporting some kind of advanced I/O pattern that works in that sort of constrained environment, that seems like a significant competitive advantage.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/pmj/rustykext"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pmj/rustykext</a>",1442439902

And if you are talking about threads-the-programming-model, which synchronization mechanism: locks, monitors, channels/queues, transactional memory?<p>If the various threads in your application don&#x27;t share data, then you don&#x27;t need to worry about all the pitfalls of threading.  But if they don&#x27;t share data and you don&#x27;t care about small (~10%) performance differences, why not use processes?  Then you can use a really straightforward blocking I/O model, <i>and</i> you get full memory isolation & security provided by the OS.<p>The interesting questions happen when you a.) want to squeeze as much performance out of the machine as possible or b.) need to share data between concurrent activities.  Then all of the different programming models have pros and cons, and I&#x27;m not sure you can define a &quot;best&quot; approach without knowing your particular problem.  (Which, IMHO, validates Rust&#x27;s &quot;provide the barest primitives you can for the problem, and let libraries provide the abstractions until it becomes clear that one library is a clear winner&quot; approach.)<p>FWIW, my experience in distributed systems is that threads+locks is a <i>terrible</i> model for writing robust systems, and that once you&#x27;re operating at scale, you really want some sort of dependency-graph dataflow system where you specify what inputs are required for each bit of computation and then the system walks the graph as RPCs come back and input becomes available.  This lets you attach all sorts of other information to nodes - timeouts, latency statistics, error statistics, whether or not this node is required and what defaults to substitute if it fails, tracing, logging, load-balancing, etc.  It also adds a huge amount of cognitive overhead for someone who just wants to make a couple database queries.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this for prototyping a webapp, but it&#x27;s also invaluable when you have a production system and ops people who need to be able to shut down a misbehaving service at a moment&#x27;s notice while still keeping your overall product up.",1442439795

Timeout handling is ugly: you need to account a timeout in each read and write operation. At least timeout handling makes coroutine/threaded code no better than state machine code. But actually in state machine approach I can set a deadline once and update it only when changed (note to myself: should add such an example to documentation). In Python, it&#x27;s usually fixed by making another coroutine with sleep and throw an exception to the one doing I/O. It works well, but Rust will never get exceptions (I hope)<p>2. When you make a server that receive a request, looks in DB then responds, there is an incentive to own (create or acquire from the pool) a DB connection by each thread. This is a sad trick. The better thing when the DB connection is handled by a coroutine on its own. Because in the latter case you may pipeline multiple requests over a connection, monitor if the connection is still alive, reconnect to DB while no requests are active, or the contrary, shut down idle connections. By pipelining you may keep less number of connections to DB so make the load to the database a little bit lower. When I&#x27;m talking about DB in this paragraph, of course, I mean everything for which this application is a client. Sure you can do that in threaded code too, but it&#x27;s much harder to get right. You need two threads per connection (because one reads network and the other looks at the queue and does write), you need to synchronize both sides, connection cleanup code is complex, there is more than one level of timeouts now, so on.<p>3. You need to avoid deadlocks. Rust takes care to avoid data races, but deadlocks are possible. And they are not always simple or reproducible, so you will have a hard time debugging them. In the single-threaded async code, you are the only user. Even if you have an async thread per processor, you are more likely to own resources instead of locking on them. You may duplicate many things for every thread. You can have more coarse-grained locks, so never hold two of them. But it&#x27;s almost impossible to write lock-free threaded server.<p>All of the issues above are neither fixed with async/await nor with any M:N or 1:1 threading approaches.",1442439433

It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that some people would argue that the complexity and tediousness in English spelling is attributable to adopting French words into the lexicon but seriously I don&#x27;t care not my problem.<p>So, I would disagree with you that English is a simple or an easy to learn language. On the contrary, it&#x27;s a life long investment and very high maintenance not only for the most complicated parts such as idioms or poetry but for the most basic ones such as reading and writing.<p>I&#x27;d be compelled to add that even Arabic and despite all the negative publicity it gets for being a complicated language which in some aspects it pretty much is, it still has a more streamlined and straightforward process than in English to reading and writing once you get your head around the concept of weak and strong vowels to start reading and writing and there&#x27;s no need to memorize words  one by one to be able to speak properly.<p>Lastly, the nerve of him calling a Romance language not pretty.

We did it so that we could get uninformed/uneducated voters to pass the legislation.  Now, I don&#x27;t mean &quot;uninformed/uneducated voters&quot; in a negative way.  Most voters, even intelligent ones, are classed as uninformed/uneducated when it comes to most topics.  Because really, who has time during their day to research all of these measures?  And funding education sounds good.  So a little &quot;end justifies the means&quot; was used here to make moves towards ending the war on drugs.<p>I want to re-iterate, using marijuana taxes for education had nothing to do with improving education.  Those who have studied the educational system in the U.S. know that funding is not the primary issue.  The system itself is sick, and not from malnutrition.  It is misguided, is mis-incentivized, and in many ways corrupt (mostly due to incompetence).<p>For example, in the past few years when schools have gotten additional funding, they have tended to spend it on technology.  They buy iPads for students and teachers, smartboards, and online learning management services (Blackboard, Google Classroom, etc).<p>None of those things have had a meaningful impact on the quality of education.  The schools continue to underpay teachers, promote hostile work environments, continue to promote overpriced, poor quality textbooks, don&#x27;t feed their poor students, force teachers to buy their own supplies, make students sick by not running AC, accept donations from their teachers and parents, and the list goes on.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that additional funding for education is not, and will not ever be about improving the quality of education.  If voters want to improve education they need to focus their attention on fixing the system itself first.  Funding should only ever be increased in tandem with efforts to root out bad actors and steer our sinking ship of education away from the rocky harbor it&#x27;s currently in.<p>Blindly increasing educational spending is the same as blindly donating food and money to the proverbial &quot;Africa&quot;.  In a similar manner, the corrupt governments where that money and food goes steal those resources to continue to fund their wars and terror.

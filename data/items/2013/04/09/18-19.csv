Out of the range of problems facing society that you could solve, of all the ways you could create value by making peoples' lives better, you settled on ""making airport pickup easy"".<p>Now, this is probably a completely rational move from the company's perspective.  Silicon Valley over the last few years has been backstopped by acquihires and other such soft landings, and big companies desperate to hire outstanding talent are often very willing to pay high prices for a great team.  From the landing page at least, it certainly doesn't look like the Just Landed guys are amateurs.  They're probably a very talented, capable team.<p>If they're successful, I won't begrudge them their success.  However, I do lament the idea that the best minds of a generation are being focused on getting people to click on ads and minimizing the number of loop-arounds you have to do at the airport.  I don't buy the idea that these guys wouldn't be focused on ""harder"" problems if consumer web didn't exist; of course they would.  This kind of talent rises to the challenge. The idea that these are the problems whose solution drives us forwards is just a monumental lapse of creativity.  Technology is an amazing thing, and we can do so much with it.

On one I could pin each VM to 1 logical core, on the other I could run 300 VMs and give each VM 24 logical cores... The first one is going to perform much better.<p>Also some hypervisors (for example VMware) only executes a VM when they have as many cores as the VM has cores available for execution. So having many logical cores in your VM can negatively influence CPU scheduling.<p>""And support is a joke.""\nNot in my experience",1365533461

The narrative that Obama <i>chose to spend more</i> on food stamps because he has an affinity for spending is misleading.

When we do any kind of HD video editing you are looking at raw video upwards of the 60gb range just for one video. Especially if you are building out renders being able to access those on a local harddrive instead of over firewire/usb would be a godsend.

Someone who has both traits may well be brighter than average.<p>Their phenomenal success isn't necessarily rooted in any one thing. Putting in the hours if you aren't that bright and actually need more sleep may be a recipe for disaster instead of a recipe for success. However, people like Bill Gates do tend to work crazy long hours. You can't ask to be born with his brains -- you have whatever brain you have -- but you can try to emulate his work habits and hope that's the most important piece.

So a currency that maintains a constant relation with the real economy probably isn't an option here and now.<p>I disagree.  A money supply that was perfectly indexed to the real economy would magnify ups and downs.  Nobody wants a slight downturn to result in a death spiral because the money supply keeps getting incrementally tighter.<p>>> If we have to choose between maintaining a single monopoly inflationary currency, or adding a deflationary alternative currency like bitcoin into the mix, such that each currency can temper the excesses of the other, I think the latter is a better choice.<p>I'm not saying bitcoin is the worst thing ever, but I think its design will keep it from making a big positive impact.

I still think in principle it would be nice to do business with fellow HNers, that's why I keep trying it.<p>Usually, I get about 2-3 inquiries per month from the Freelancer thread - by far most of these from people who apparently came through a search engine and aren't HN users at all. Of these, 2 are general carpet bombing mails, asking me for things that I didn't advertise and can't/won't provide (""would you like to move to Berlin and work as an entry-level tech support person?""). Sometimes, that leaves one real contact.<p>Here's where things start to get on my nerves: there will typically be an exchange of 3 to 4 emails back and forth. It starts with a project introduction (which is often excellently detailed), then we're moving on to references and code samples, then we're talking fees (even though I explicitly state them on my profile website), after which it's all ""I'll totally do this project with you"", and after that: nothing. In two cases, there were even 30+ minutes Skype conversations, all for nothing of course.<p>Last month I decided to do something different, be more proactive: I sent out emails to people looking for freelancers on HN. Same procedure (see above), same results. <i>But</i> I got something very interesting out of it: a few of them told me they received upwards of 30 applicants! Holy crap, even for the lamer job postings!<p>It's now clear to me why the freelancer thread doesn't work, at least for ""normal"" HNers like me. As a freelancer, there is so much competition, the chances of success are exceedingly slim. Companies are drowning in applicants. Of course they're going to choose either the cheapest one, or if you're lucky enough to inhabit something of a niche, the most famous one.<p>So why are they not responding?

We are not really a team, everyone eats lunch at their desk or with other groups and people raise their voice frequently (and management does nothing about it...I think they see it as passion).<p>We are using Agile where we time-box everything and commit to its delivery.

5519866,comment,5517983,5517983,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Fascinating discussion. Restores my faith in HN to have these sorts of threads.<p>#1 To edw519 on Elon's failed marriage, I'm reminded of that economist joke about ""is that expensive or is it valuable?"" For me, my family is priceless I cherish them with all my heart, but for others I know their work drives them. I don't begrudge them for having different reward structures in their brain, and I would never go so far as to suggest that one set of choices is ""better"" than another. I share the opinion that making a vow of marriage is a pretty huge promise, but that is because in <i>my context</i> it was a huge promise that I made. As opposed to folks I've known who got married but made a different sort of promise. I attended a wedding where the vows were not ""until death do us part"" but were ""for as long as we both shall love."" To which I said, ""Seriously? Until you decide you are tired of it?"" But my point is that we don't know <i>what</i> promise Elon made when he married.<p>#2 on the ""where are they"" question, the author (jnp) doesn't take into account that first you have to be a billionaire and <i>then</i> you have to care about ""sci-fi stuff"". When I sample the general population I find that people who care about science fiction type technologies and making them real is a small fraction of the general population, so I am not surprised that only a small fraction of the billionaires have similar ideas about interesting questions. What I find even more amazing is that none of them have apparently taken any of the 'unconventional' fusion projects under their wing (which is almost <i>thematically</i> Tony Stark).<p>The last bit I'll add is a bit I've added before which is that I have observed that ""rich you"" is a different person than ""not-rich you"" for most technologists I've met. (sample size isn't large but I think over the years I've known/observed on the order of 200 people who have gone from ""not rich""[1] to ""rich""[2] and in most of the cases there was a pretty big shift in what they valued and who they were. Because of that one has to add that someone who is interested in sci-fi stuff now, needs to still be interested in it post-change. And as others have pointed out, Elon has put everything on the line to advance sci-fi stuff a number of times, and that willingness to risk being ""not rich"" again is perhaps the rarest trait of all.<p>[1] Defining ""not rich"" as having debts that they would have to forfeit if they lost employment and future obligations that are not yet funded.<p>[2] Defining ""rich"" as having no debts for which forfeiting them would change their lifestyle, and having a source of income from passive investing that is sufficient under both optimistic and pessimistic economic scenarios.",1365530577

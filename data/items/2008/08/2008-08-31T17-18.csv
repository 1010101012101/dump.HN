The argument was that NASA's can't-use-solar-at-the-distance-of-Saturn argument didn't hold water in light of the fact that NASA even chose to put an RTG on a Sun explorer.<p><i>it doesn't seem likely, since solar power is plentiful there.</i><p>That was the crux of the NASA-can't-be-trusted argument.",1220204761

291435,comment,291399,291399,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yes.  Why would a big corporation want to hire someone who can come up with ideas and implement them without ""adult supervision""?  That would make the 100 layers of management useless, and nobody wants to be useless.<p>The ideal candidate will be smart but have no ambition to do anything on his/her own.

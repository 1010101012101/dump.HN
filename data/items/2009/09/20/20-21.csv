833507,comment,833425,833425,0,0,kyro,,,"I can't emphasize the body language part enough. A lot of the time, and I have been guilty of this, people go on and on about a project they're working on, even when they sort of notice the other party not interested, hoping that the person's mind will change once they hit some critical part of their monologue, or that once done, the person listening will evaluate the idea as a whole and finally get it.<p>Learning how to pick up on the nuances of body language is really important. The angle at which the person you're talking to is standing, their eye movement, how engaged they are, are all cues to their level of interest. If a person isn't standing parallel to you, that could mean that they're preparing to walk off, or are opening the ground for others to enter, and if you pick up on that, quickly move to what you want and end it. If you keep going, it's more than likely that the person really isn't listening to a word you're saying and cannot wait until you're done. Shifty eyes, or occasionally smiling at passer-byers, etc, are also signs that the conversation isn't really going anywhere.<p>Being able to read body language in general is good skill to have (interviews, friendly interactions, etc).",1253479005

(In fact, even when their end goal is to make something nice, they may still start with something ugly to make sure that everything else is working.)<p>There's really only two ways to solve that: give them more time to ship and make ""great UI"" a clear deliverable (that they're paid for), <i>or</i> give them better tools and expect correspondingly-better results in the time originally allotted.<p>Assuming your company isn't producing just one product, it's usually wiser to invest in the programming tools.  That way, you pay most of the cost once, during development and perfection of the tools, instead of having every single product pay a penalty as programmers and QA have to correct cosmetic and behavioral imperfections in the UI in 1000 places.<p>Take Interface Builder and Cocoa on Mac OS X.  The design of the layout tool, combined with the unapologetic adherence to MVC and KVC design principles in the API, means that interfaces are <i>easier to do elegantly than inelegantly</i>.

It's dirty, underdeveloped, etc. You drive down one block and see rundown apartment buildings, and out of nowhere you see a marble crafted government building that has not one blemish or crack. However, being a Copt, I do find the monasteries to be one of the few preserved gems of Egypt, where you can see artwork from hundreds and hundreds of years ago still in its original form painted on huge rock walls. Other than that, and the handful of tourist spots (museums, libraries and whatever is left of the ancient ruins), I really can't suggest anywhere to visit in Egypt that'll give you that Indiana Jones, culturally rich 3rd world country feel to it.

Marriage.  That's right.  I have a friend that did it  (with way less than 20k).  Sure there are some steps to prevent fraud (even interviews), but that doesn't stop most people getting married just for citizenship, except the most obvious cases.<p>According to the 'nay-sayers' logic, we should stop giving green card/citizenship through marriage, b/c maybe 15% of them are fraud.<p>If you really really want to live in the US, and have about 50k,  you will find somebody that will marry  (my friend found it for a lot less money).  No need to go through this Visa problem.<p>It is kinda wierd, but it is much easier for a less educated person to game the system, then for somebody that is more educated  (most under the table jobs,are blue collar ones).<p>In any way, saying we shouldn't let the Founder Visa b/c there might be potential fraud,  is pure FUD.   Fear, uncertainty, and doubt,  just for your own little short sighted self.<p>If you enjoy an america without immigrants, a  go live in West Virginia, or Alabama.",1253477277

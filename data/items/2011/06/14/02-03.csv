2651621,comment,2647219,2647837,2,0,corruptmemory,,,"To reiterate a point implied by other commenters: macro-expansion is a compile-time operation.  If the language utilizes a typing system to help promote sound programming then the results of the expansion will be compiled in the context of type constraints - the expansion is either sound or unsound w.r.t. such constraints.<p>To some extent there is a continuing popular schism with the idea that ""strongly typed"" must be synonymous with the lack of ""eval"", which, at least in principle, cannot be true.  In fact, StandardML does have the ability to extend the environment of a program at run-time (as well as Typed Racket).  All the necessary typing and meta-data is retained at run-time so that newly evaluated code is checked for type-consistency just like when the ""main code"" was compiled.  So, not only can one expand macros at compile time and verify that the expansions are sound, one can also do the same at run-time.",1308019911

2651618,comment,2649162,2651122,1,0,6ren,,,"What do you think of my concern of it ""scattering the transition logic"" across the classes? Each class becomes a production, and only it knows which classes can come next. It's hard to get an overall grasp of how the state machine works, because you have to inspect all the classes to know the transitions.<p>This is a significant concern for me when reading others' code: the individual parts might be easy to understand, but there is usually no documentation of the overall design, of how the parts operate together.  And there is no code that ties together all the parts - so you are forced to inspect all the local details in order to get a global overall view.<p>There are many ways to evaluate a program - how efficient it is, how many features it has, how complete it is, whether it is consistent, whether it is correct, how easy it is to prove things about... but I think how much work it is to understand is one of the most important - and usually neglected. For a complex program, having some way to quickly grasp the overall design is key to this, IMHO.",1308019857

They had a REALLY simple layout which was well organized, directed you to the needed info and was easy to consume. They cared about having high quality content with information (like size, number of views, etc)  that helped a visitor to decide what was important to look at.

I simply don't get enough time to hack around in Haskell.  As far as being primitive, I guess you would have to compare that to the drudgery of emitting all the automatically generated code produced by macro expansions by hand.  Yes, in Haskell TH is relatively infrequently used.<p>In no way am I trivializing the complexity of what would be involved in bringing a useful macro system to Scala, but compiler plugins for Scala are filling this role today, a good macro system could make meta programming more accessible. Already there are plugins for SBT to invoke FreeMarker on Scala-program templates to generate code, clearly a poor-man's solution, but it simply is more evidence that a macro-system would and would be put to good use were one available.<p>Taking Racket as an example, a good macro system would enable many kinds of experimentation in the Scala language without having to extend the core directly.  In Typed Racket Hindley-Milner type-inference was added on-top of a  dynamically typed-core, and Typed Racket targets Haskell-level (or better) typing infrastructure.  All this enabled essentially due to support of Macros.<p>RE: Cutting edge - And Haskell isn't? While there are a number of language features where Scala may in fact outshine Haskell, I would hardly place Haskell in the old and well-trodden place on the programming language landscape.

And for a flat rate given how big some people's music library are and the free upgrade to higher quality version, it's not necessarily a bad deal.<p>That said, most music businesses do fail or struggle severely including the above as well as Pandora and Napster among others.

His contributions to the Ruby community have been notable because of their challenging nature.  Merging Merb and Rails was a gargantuan project, getting a large established framework to accept that level of outside input was impressive.  The level of refactoring that went into it went against prudence, but I can't argue with the results.  Rails 3 is awesome.<p>Similarly Yehuda and Carl spearheaded Bundler development.  They bit off a massive problem that touches anyone doing large scale ruby development and through sheer force of will hammered out a powerful solution that solves the majority of common issues in a relatively straightforward manner.  There's lots to argue with, for sure, maybe it's over-engineered, maybe they didn't work closely enough with RubyGems core, etc; but at the end of the day they solved a problem that was too hairy for the average dev to have much hope of solving.<p>Yehuda's been there, done that.

The only problem is on the motivation dimensions their scales get way tipped over..<p>As an example, you may look at what is happening on HN and wish for what Andrew Mason is doing with Groupon or Zuckerberg has achieved with FB. The issue is that while that goal is extremely attractive the expectancy of you achieving it is very negative and so the motivation vector ends up pointing in the negative direction.<p>Developing this argument as I go along, I would therefore say that the correct approach is to take stock of what your current strengths are, what your challenges are and strategize a plan. Namely one that sets you up with small bite sized goals which are positively geared for your current situation and continually update the goal statuses. Maybe have daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and half yearly goals and work on them.<p>THEREFORE, you can definitely change, you just need to have realistic goals and discipline to tough it out.",1308018069

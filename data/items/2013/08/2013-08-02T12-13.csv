I did not share this email with any vendor. The only possibility is that my email provider (outlook.com) is getting info about my browsing from the browser chrome or my chrome browser knows about my email and is selling my email and browsing history.<p>The other day i was talking to a friend on facebook chat about his new profession about diamonds. I am sure i did not even type any search for it and within 10 minutes i received an email from amazon (i have an amazon account) about diamond necklace discounts, which is freaking horrible. I mean facebook is sharing all my chat with a vendor. Or more generally i can say if i am talking about business on the internet anyone can snoop on my conversation (now i dont care about govt. snooping, but if some ecommerce site can get access to my chats thats so horrible for privacy and trade and almost everything.=<p>How can i get rid of this. Is it a good idea to use a browser specifically for email and facebook and doing everything else on the other browsers assuming the cookies are not shared between browsers and there will be no way hopefully these email providers or search providers can sell my private chats.",1375448384

But if a drug user is self-destructive enough to buy only drugs and no food, he or she would probably just take an overdose anyway.<p>As a case in point, Norway&#x27;s social safety net provides a living wage to anyone who can&#x27;t provide for themselves. This involves a lot of drug users. They do end up spending some of the money on drugs, but at least they don&#x27;t starve or freeze to death. I think this is a tradeoff that&#x27;s worth it. You both save the effort of micromanaging and provide some dignity to people who have too little of it.

However, arguing that it sucks because the developers are privileged white dudes motivated by making money is not a valid argument.  The author even points to an example of a good api from Microsoft.  Do you really believe the developers at Microsoft back in the 90s weren&#x27;t motivated by making money?  The Facebook API sucks for so many reasons.  Zuckerburg originally wrote Facebook in PHP, he was not a computer scientist scientist, their motto is &quot;move fast and break things&quot;.  It&#x27;s an experiment and they made some mistakes.  To imply its flaws are rooted in capitalism is wrong.  I realize profit and money are popular punching bags.  It feels good to think you are morally superior and have other people think you are a good person.  However, the hate and bile being spewed at anyone trying to make a buck is irrational.  No one is holding a gun to anyone&#x27;s head telling them they have to use Facebook. Go out and make something better.",1375448326

It&#x27;s very bad habit/behavior/addiction. So first of all, take it seriously.<p>Here&#x27;s some things that work/have worked for me, in no particular order. They all interact and work best in bunches. None have cured me. All have helped.<p>1. meditation - many meditation practices develop your ability to prevent your mind from wandering. Letting your mind wander is a big part of procrastination. It also helps with patience which is also important.<p>2. Recognize the impulse and address it - This is very complimentary to meditation. You sit down to do a task, then your mind looks for some sort of procrastination (reading, games). Recognize that feeling and feel it. Don&#x27;t fight it, just experience it for a few seconds. Then place your hands flat on your desk. Your feet flat on the ground. Straighten your back. Breath deep 5 times. The impulse should pass. Tweak this as you like as long as you recognize the impulse, experience it & have a little ritual (sitting straight, breathing, etc.)<p><i>This sounds like hippy dippy bullshit said out loud, but it doesn&#x27;t feel half as lame when you do it. It is very effective.</i><p>3. Collaboration - If two people are at a computer, procrastination does not go on for  hours. More generally, try to seek out work less procrastination-inducing.<p>4. Do work in small batches - Take 5 minute breaks every hour. etc. This increases the feedback to you that you are procrastinating.<p>5. Talk about it.<p>6. Accountability mechanisms - Your ability to hide is an enabler. Try timed screenshots sent to a friend. Twice daily 2 minute confessional phone call to a friend. Mirror your screen someplace it can be seen by everyone. Coaching sessions. Lots of options. Quirky is ok.<p>7. Drugs - ADD medication (eg ritalin) can help.<p>8. Sleep - Less Sleep = More Procrastination. Maybe you need more sleep. Maybe you need 10 hours. everyone is different. Try getting 10 hours for one week and see if it helps.",1375447495

Granted, some things really are best represented textually (certainly complex expressions or formulas) but a lot of code is just routing data around and I found that the visual languages I&#x27;ve used (mainly Max and Synthmaker) really shine at that. in fact, I find that moving data around is the single most important programming task in <i>most</i> programs.<p>Other areas where visual programming really shines is in experimental programming and I think a big part of that is that 1) you can easily &quot;wire&quot; things up differently and change things just to see what happens and 2) you don&#x27;t have to name things until you&#x27;re good and ready. You still should properly name things, of course, but during prototyping and experimentation I find this often gets in my way when using textual languages and I end up giving things temporary names like foo or x. Another area where (some) visual languages shine is debugging because they often let you visually see the flow of data through the code and intercept it and such. I found Max/MSP&#x27;s debugger to be very nice to use, though I also feel there is a lot of room for it to improve even more still and unit testing tools are needed too.<p>As for refactoring - you know how some IDE&#x27;s have a feature where you can select a bunch of code and hit refactor and it puts it into its own function for you? Max does this really well too: click-drag to select all the components you want to factor out and it places it all into a new component for you. Really quick and easy. This isn&#x27;t a visual vs textual thing but rather a tooling thing, of course.",1375447065

Processors got twice as fast every two process generations. Shared memory multiprocessors were an exotic niche. But then we hit the power wall, and all of a sudden shared memory multiprocessors became the norm. Today, you can not just wait for a new processor to make your program magically faster, you have to rewrite it. If you asked the same people who took these decisions in the 90ies today, many would (and many actually did so publically) say that they regret this decision.<p>On, complexity. Yes, software is incredibly complex. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t want to add even more complexity to it!<p>> How does ARM manage significantly lower power consumption?<p>Easy, ARM is targetting the low power market. So they don&#x27;t need to build the fastest chip. When you try to build the fastest chip, energy efficiency suffers a lot.

But for me none of these things worked.<p>If you are like me, the problem was I had no reason to improve myself. I had no motivation to improve my life beyond its basic needs. You have an easy life - you have money, time and good health (just an assumption) but clearly there is still something wrong. Something gnawed at you enough today to make you write this post. Something is telling you that your life could be so much better.<p>I recommend reading the book <i>Getting Past OK</i> by Richard Brodie (a fellow programmer). For me the helpful points in the book were:<p>- It is possible to drastically improve your life, to find meaning and happiness (I was pretty skeptical of this point in general before picking the book up)<p>- You need to accept who you are now (skrebbel commented on this already)<p>- The beliefs, opinions and feelings you have about things (e.g. doing &quot;work&quot; is a chore) are the product of your experience up to this point. This means they can be changed. If you identify a belief that is holding you back, you can change it to fit your goals.<p>- Procrastination is just one of your problems and is actually quite easy to fix once you figured out why you want to fix it. There is a section of the book devoted to breaking out of the procrastination habit.<p>- If you want to be successful you have to be committed. This might sound hard and constraining but once you figure out &quot;ok this is want I really want&quot;, it&#x27;s just the opposite.<p>I am still nowhere near where I should be. I don&#x27;t think that book has all the answers. But I think it is a great start - you can even read it while procrastinating from work if you like :)<p>Good luck!",1375445898

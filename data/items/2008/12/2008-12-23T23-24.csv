People might make interesting things only compatible with Rails.<p>When Merb was a pretty big, active minority, it was more compelling to go out of one's way to make interesting libraries (ORMs, gems, etc.) easily compatible with anything ruby.<p>Rails is gaining modularity, but I fear Ruby overall might lose it. Even after Rails and Merb merge, rails!=ruby.",1230076445

408228,comment,407646,407646,0,0,keefe,,,"I think it's better to give an answer directly related to your skills in your field. None of us is perfect, and we should all have some particular things we are working on. If you get the job, your actual weaknesses will become apparent soon enough. I could say, for example, that I tend to focus on functionality vs readability in code, but after a few years in commercial software development I see that maintainability of the code is of paramount importance so I am working to better present my code so that others can use it.",1230076179

408212,comment,407555,407879,0,0,kylec,,,"My main problem has been that after I say everything that I want to say I still have several pages to fill. I imagine this would be like asking a programmer to deliver a 2000 line program that the programmer can write in 200. It could be a psychological revulsion to waste (using more words/lines than are needed) or it could be that I don't have sufficient depth in my thinking to produce the volume of content needed to explore the topic. Either way, I think that I've probably seen the last of my mandatory minimum page lengths, so I'm not particularly worried about it. Still, it would have been a nice skill to have back in high school.",1230075154

And yes, there are more Wiis in living rooms and 360s and PS3s combined.<p>However, success is not only measured in short term profits. When Netflix was support was added to the Xbox Dashboard software a few weeks ago, it became the number one delivery vehicle for instant watch videos overnight. To scoff at that level of influence over the entertainment space is shortsighted.<p>Additionally, the sales trends of every console in recorded gaming history shows 80% of the console sales occurred when the price was below $200.

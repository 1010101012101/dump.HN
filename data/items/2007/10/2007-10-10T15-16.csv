I'm not sure the South Korean bot is deployed yet. <p>The reason that South Korean bot is so impressive (and scary as hell) is that the damn thing is autonomous, not tele-operated. There's something about the idea of a machine making the call to kill a human that's kind of horrifying. <p>I guess looking at it from the perspective that the code in the machine is just the automated thoughts of a human makes it seem more like deferred human intention than machine-uprising.

I guess that might count as the first shot, although I'm pretty sure there is a manual confirmation there before it does anything.",1192031458

65837,comment,65815,65815,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"There are many factors to consider in evaluating the value of a move.  Depending on the nature of your startup, it may be more or less valuable to make the move to the Valley.  <p>Here's a few factors that seem relevant to that evaluation.<p>1. Access to capital<p>If your company has large upfront capital requirements, then being in a setting with VC's who aren't afraid to take a risk has obvious benefits.  However, a lot of web 2.0 startups have relatively low starting costs. You can self-finance the development and launch of a product which attracts a rapidly growing userbase.  The main cost isn't even monetary, its opportunity cost.  With this done, attracting VC interest is a lot easier, regardless of where you are.<p>2. Access to talent<p>Naively, the Bay Area has a lot more talent than other locations and this makes it a better place to do a startup.  Problem is, the competition for talent is a lot tougher.  If you're a startup in a place with relatively few startups, you have a real shot at attracting the top programmers locally, because you're the only game in town.  In the Bay Area you're competing against Google, Facebook and all the rest.<p>I'm in Waterloo, Canada, and this is evident locally.  Waterloo has a terrific undergrad CS program - supposedly, its Microsoft's number one recruiting School - and lots of really talented developers.  But there are relatively few Web 2.0 companies in town, which means that startups have (if they're willing to work at it) access to an amazingly talented pool of potential employees, and a real shot at hiring those people.<p>I don't think one even needs a top CS school locally.  My background is as a theoretical physicist, and my observation is that at least in theoretical physics the quality of the top students is pretty much the same everywhere.  I'd be surprised if there was much difference in CS.  There will be more extraordinary programmers in the MIT CS program, but they will still be there at Podunk State University, and if you're careful and aim high, you'll have a real shot at getting those people onboard.  <p>3. Culture<p>I don't mean art and a nice orchestra.  I mean access to a ""can-do"" culture, full of sharp people who are plugged in, full of the latest news, insightful (and original!) analysis, and can act as role models, mentors, advisors, and so on.  Really sharp criticism and suggestions are worth their weight in gold.<p>This is something where the Startup Hubs have a major advantage.  It also seems to me perhaps the biggest advantage of the YC program - the dinners and other events.  In places that are less of a Hub it seems to me that you need to consciously build a really wide network of people who can act in that role for you.  This requires work anywhere, but it is a lot harder in somewhere without a startup culture than it is in the Valley.<p>4. Access to other companies<p>For some startups it's really important to have access to other companies for partnerships, distribution and so on.  For others it's much less important.  Obviously, in the former situation being in a Hub has a major benefit, while in the latter situation it is less so.",1192031386

65829,comment,65329,65645,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Your final point is good. A graphic-to-lexicon mapping would be very useful for research and education, and I am not familiar with what is available in this area. If this is your plan, it might have very broad applications. However the mapping would be very loose because categories are never absolute (hence Sapir Whorf). Case in point: some cultures agree by shaking heads and disagree by nodding. There was a time in China where the red light meant ""go"" and green meant ""stop."" You may thus have pictures which mean exact opposites to two different people.<p>It's just a problem I'm pointing out, and that a YC-style voting is not going to realize the potential of the idea. But my case about the prototype is very solid though. Your definition of a chair is not ""correct."" Nobody's is. I happen to lay my buttox on a teapot, now it's also a chair. Not trying to cavil here, but think of how that would affect your program if you type ""chair"" and a teapot shows up.",1192029946

124651,comment,123946,124235,0,0,mironathetin,,,"Exactly, you are wasting your money.<p>The main reason for me to use macs is mac os. While the features of the apple hardware are nice, and they look good and all that,  the most important thing to have is a commandline and a set of decent apps like photoshop, bbedit etc, on one machine. Most linux applications are crap compared to os x apps!!!!<p>If you want to run linux and are not on a tight budget, I recommend Thinkpads. Although not all features are perfectly easy to activate (power management, bluetooth, wireless :o|), the hardware is superior to macs.<p>I paid the price for Powerbooks since ever. But now I have decided to go with a MacBook (as soon as they come with LED backlit screens). I think the value for the money is much better. I'd rather pump them up with the largest and fastest drive and memory.",1204110725

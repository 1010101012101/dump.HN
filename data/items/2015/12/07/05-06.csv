AFAIK on real hardware it does what it should, i.e. causes the CPU to reset. The fact that OSs in the past have relied on triple-faulting to cause a reset[2] makes this all the more unusual. Then again, I suppose no one has really tried to run MS-DOS and related software in Xen...<p><i>the vulnerability can be avoided altogether if\nthe guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest\nadministrator</i><p>That sort of defeats the point of using a VM, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_fault"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_fault</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.rcollins.org/Productivity/TripleFault.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rcollins.org/Productivity/TripleFault.html</a>",1449467941

It&#x27;s also theoretically possible to put 3 chop sticks on top of each other, put them on your head and walk like that to your super market. That doesn&#x27;t mean you can do it, by adding some beans and nuts to your diet. It&#x27;s so complicated that some doctors think they can&#x27;t do it for a long time to themselves.<p>This is such FUD nonsense; pretty deplorable on this forum. There&#x27;s nothing theoretical about eating &quot;complete and healthy without meat&quot; -  people have been living on vegan and vegetarian diets for centuries without ill effects. People have become bodybuilders, MMA fighters while being vegan too, not that the vast majority of humans need to measure their diets by those of elite athletes.<p>As for &quot;so complicated&quot; here is the American Dietetic Association:<p>>It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.

They can assign access based on the labels, or to individual users. When the user represents an organization the labels basically represent roles for permissions. The same system is used for both people sharing with friends and organizations sharing with various members.<p>Now, as a user you can also invite others. Then a unique invitation link is generated, and securely delivered to an endpoint such as an email or sms. The recipient may choose to follow the link, which confirms their email address or mobile number. From there, we see if they already have an account or create a new one without any action on their part. (Password can be set up next time they try to log in with that email address or mobile number.)<p>It is at this point that we look at the access granted in the invite. We make sure that the inviting user has at least those permissions (so you can&#x27;t eg send yourself an invite to survive getting banned from a chatroom) and then grant them to the invited user via the access system.<p>We have three levels of permissions: readLevel, writeLevel and adminLevel. Each ranges from 0 to 40, signifying various things (eg a writeLevel of 40 lets you delete that whole social collaborative thing).<p>So the invitations are kind of like capabilities. And we do a check upon the person redeeming the invitation. But once the user accepts the invitation, they have an id and we use our general system of access control, so admins can set up the access for various types of contacts.",1449464861

It would cost ~$80,000 or more in conc. vanadium for storing 100 kwH - just enough energy to keep a house safely off the grid.<p>To that price you have to add the solar system to charge it, the cell stack, the conc. H2SO4 you have to dissolve the vanadium in etc.<p>We need to get way cheaper then that before we can get serious about this - ideally cheap enough that we can encourage everyone to have a cell stack in their house that offsets their peak loads. That would open up some real options.",1402757835
7892871,comment,7891017,7891445,2,0,nhangen,,,"I disagree. Your psychological understanding has a long way to go.<p>In fact, this sounds like someone rationalizing a lack of achievement rather than trying to understand the true motivations of an achievement oriented person.<p>The path is not masochistic or narcissistic. In fact, I take offense to that.<p>The path is what separates the wheat from the chaff. It is the price for admission...table stakes.<p>Achievement oriented people don&#x27;t suffer depression because of regret, they suffer depression because that too is a requirement for playing the game. I can only speak for myself, but by the time I have achieved something I wanted, I&#x27;m already thinking about the next goal. When I finally reach the first goal, I have little time to celebrate, but that&#x27;s OK because it&#x27;s not the goal that rewards us, but the path to achieving it.<p>The difference between being depressed by it and not being depressed by it is realizing that one cannot continually achieve without being dissatisfied. The two go hand in hand. Once I realized that, everything changed.<p>That said, there is some insight buried within your conclusion. Depression reaches its peak when a person defines themselves by their work and/or achievements. The best way to overcome that is to become a whole person. My personal approach is to play sports, go running, practice hobbies, and spend time with my family.<p>Of course, none of this really helps when things are going poorly or you are failing. In those times, the only remedy is to come to terms with the fact that you could lose it all, and let&#x27;s face it - that&#x27;s a reality that none of us want to accept until it happens, and even then we&#x27;ll battle it.<p>I&#x27;ve been to that point twice, and each time sucked worse than that last. However, it&#x27;s the only fuel I need to prevent myself from allowing it to happen again.<p>So to get back to Sam&#x27;s point and give it the attention it deserves - yes, talking to someone will help, but so too will the realization that it&#x27;s never over. It sounds cliche, but Lombardi was right. &quot;It&#x27;s not whether you got knocked down, it&#x27;s whether you get back up&quot; that counts.

A big chunk of it.\n2. she were most likely raised by her mother, and influenced strongly by who she was, the good and the bad.\n3. on account of being of the same gender, a mother is usually a primary role model to woman, in the same way many fathers are to men.<p>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s plenty of evidence.<p>I&#x27;d also say that the same goes for men, and more recently I&#x27;ve been amazed by how similar my siblings are to me, in comparison to the rest of the world.<p>Anecdotally, it&#x27;s true to varying degrees with all women I know, and the similarities only became more visible as I got to know them better.<p>While I&#x27;m not a big fan of the points OP picked to focus on (&quot;how well she keeps the home in order, raise kids, and AGE&quot;), I don&#x27;t think his statement that women often become like their mothers is so incredibly bold or hard to believe.<p>While my impressions of a love interest&#x27;s mother (and to a lesser degree father) are not the deciding factor, they are an important data point, because in every relationship I&#x27;ve had, specific &#x27;issues&#x27; that were immediately obvious in her parents eventually bubbled up in her as well.

7892836,comment,7892659,7892772,19,0,Tarrosion,,,"> What is wrong with present methodologies of energy storage? For example using surplus power to pump water up hill, to later recuperate during peak hours?<p>Say you want to store 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity (most places in the United States, about $0.12 worth). That&#x27;s 3.6 million joules of energy. The potential energy gained by moving an object away from the Earth is approximately m * g * h, were m is mass, g gravity, and h height. g is approximately 10, and in a home system let&#x27;s say h is also approximately 10. Probably less. Then the amount of water you need to move is approximately 36,000 kilograms. At 1 kilogram per liter, that&#x27;s 36,000 liters or approximately 9,000 gallons. For comparison, that&#x27;s roughly the size of a moderate swimming pool.<p>And of course, there are many other problems: converting electricity to pump action to water movement to potential energy back to electricity is not 100% efficient. That much water is extremely heavy; there&#x27;s a reason swimming pools are often built in the ground. Etc. And all that for just 1 kilowatt hour!<p>My urban apartment uses O(10) kilowatt hours per day, so even if only a small fraction of that must be stored, my roommate and I would require a swimming pool or three. Hard to find space in a city...this could all be done remotely, but then transmission loss cuts the efficiency further.",1402756354

The various stages of vanadium compounds are likely a bigger concern than the various reaction agents.<p>The big reason pumped storage isn&#x27;t more prevalent is that it isn&#x27;t all that trivial to make it economical (you need a big reservoir to have much capacity). You also end up needing a lot of concrete, which also comes from mines (and requires a bunch of energy to produce).<p>The better tradeoff is probably to examine and carefully control mining practices (as opposed to sort of endorsing the status quo material consumption).",1402756351

We recovered it using roughly the same steps. We didn&#x27;t need to write in assembler though since we&#x27;ve had Sun compiler tool chain in /opt that survived.

7892783,comment,7892659,7892772,2,0,Nanzikambe,,,"&quot;Metallic vanadium is not found in nature, but vanadium compounds occur naturally in about 65 different minerals. Economically significant examples include patronite (VS4),[26] vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl), and carnotite (K2(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O). Much of the world&#x27;s vanadium production is sourced from vanadium-bearing magnetite found in ultramafic gabbro bodies. Vanadium is mined mostly in South Africa, north-western China, and eastern Russia. In 2010 these three countries mined more than 98% of the 56,000 tonnes of produced vanadium.[27]<p>Vanadium is also present in bauxite and in fossil fuel deposits such as crude oil, coal, oil shale and tar sands. In crude oil, concentrations up to 1200 ppm have been reported. When such oil products are burned, the traces of vanadium may initiate corrosion in motors and boilers.[28] An estimated 110,000 tonnes of vanadium per year are released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels.[29] Vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and some other stars.[30]&quot;<p>&quot;Vanadium metal is obtained via a multistep process that begins with the roasting of crushed ore with NaCl or Na2CO3 at about 850 °C to give sodium metavanadate (NaVO3). An aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to give &quot;red cake&quot;, a polyvanadate salt, which is reduced with calcium metal. As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use, in all of which vanadium is produced as a byproduct of other processes.[31] Purification of vanadium is possible by the crystal bar process developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. It involves the formation of the metal iodide, in this example vanadium(III) iodide, and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal.[32]&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium#Occurrence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium#Occurrence</a><p>So not only is extracting this stuff going to involve mining, the process of extraction itself relies on extremely toxic substances, and the most economic areas to mine it are places it&#x27;s less than prudent to rely upon economically (China, Russia, South Africa)",1402754961

9529801,comment,9526440,9526440,0,0,pron,,,"> What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.<p>... given you have no information about runtime behavior other than the static code.<p>How to achieve &quot;zero-cost abstractions&quot; is, as usual, a design tradeoff.<p>Rust -- like C++ -- lets you choose in your code whether you&#x27;d like to pay for an abstraction or not. This does produce good machine code, but has two costs: 1/ the language gets more complicated and the programmer needs to be aware of what she&#x27;s paying for, and 2/ you might end up paying for stuff you end up not using (for example, all button listeners might end up being the same type, and a vtable adds unnecessary cost), so that the generated code is only optimal if you have no other information about runtime behavior.<p>There&#x27;s another way to add zero-cost abstractions: have a single simple abstraction and a JIT to figure out at runtime -- based on observed behavior -- what the optimal machine code is. This is what the JVM does. All method calls are virtual from the programmer&#x27;s perspective, and no choice needs to be made ahead of time. At runtime, the JIT views the class hierarchy and usage, and decides whether a specialized, inlined version of a function is produced or whether a vtable is actually necessary (HotSpot even makes a special case when there are exactly two implementations, replacing the vtable with an `if`). If runtime behavior changes (a new type of listener is added or even new code is loaded at runtime that adds another implementation), the JIT will notice, reconsider and recompile. So in Java, virtual or even interface method calls are also zero-cost, even though you have no choice about using them; the decision on how to implement the abstraction is done by the (JIT) compiler <i>at runtime</i>. This, too, is a tradeoff -- a simpler language and truly optimal code taking into consideration not only static consideration but actual runtime behavior -- at the cost of a possibly significant warmup time and possible non-optimal &quot;mistakes&quot; by the JIT.",1431410278

Furthermore, after reading the post, I checked out the website to understand how their business model and core value proposition is different from the other dating sites out there (tinder, okcupid, match, plenty of fish) and it&#x27;s plainly obvious while it&#x27;s not an investable idea in its current form. Their core value proposition is that they can provide better matches than automated systems by using <i>skilled</i> people to do the matching. If the skill required is a commodity (like driving or cleaning homes), then there is a potentially scaleable business model, but when it relies on specialized and uncommon skills, it&#x27;s basically a consulting firm.<p>The only examples of a successful &quot;consulting firm&quot; that I can think of off the top of my head that has seen any sizable investment is Palantir. Their market may be very small, but each contract is worth so much that there is a huge opportunity. How big is the addressable market of $800/month dating consulting and dating life management? Seems more like a solid lifestyle business than the unicorns that most SV investors are chasing.<p>The mantra &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; really is about getting traction and growth to get the party started and multiply effectiveness. However, even those things that you initially do that don&#x27;t scale should eventually be scaleable or else you have a permanent cost center that scales with the business. When your business model doesn&#x27;t scale you need to rethink the business model.<p>Are there highly profitable businesses that are consulting firms? Totally. McKinsey, Bain, Booz Allen, Accenture, etc. are all large companies that are profitable and provide consulting services. However, the people investing in those types of business models are not the investors in Silicon Valley. Investors in SV understand software/hardware and using them to increase productivity, providing more value at a lower cost. Unless there is an alternative narrative they are telling investors about how they plan to pivot to something else, I can&#x27;t help but wonder how such a business model scales to a high valuation in the time scales most venture capital funds have until they need to divest.<p>Lastly, who on the founding team has professional experience as an engineer? Only the CTO (who has a CompSci degree) has done any software engineering in a professional setting and that was as an intern for 3 months in 2007. Solid personal projects count too, but the CTO has only one repo on github that isn&#x27;t a fork and it&#x27;s a basic html/css/js github.io page. I&#x27;m not saying that you need to have a strong, experienced technical co-founder to found a successful company, but it&#x27;s a huge strike against a startup for being investible if there isn&#x27;t one.<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiebambino"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiebambino</a>

2) shared filesystems really are brlilliant.<p>Let me unpack that:<p>a mainframe provides a massive amount of hardware, a hypervisor and scheduler. This means that you can control a bunch of isolated processes through one one system easily. Something that you can&#x27;t really do in docker yet (fleet/kubernetes arn&#x27;t there yet. in a mainframe you can use a single script to control an entire system)<p>Quite a lot of web config management is about shipping packages to different machines. Almost all of this config, and therefore complication can be removed by using a shared filesystem.<p>For example we have many version of java. For some reason they are in seperate repos. This means that if you want to change version (openJDK to oracle etc) you have to change config. With a shared file system, in the $PATH, you&#x27;d just say <i>oracalejava-1.8 $programme</i> or <i>java-1.7 $programme</i><p>If you make your deploys to a similar shared filesystem, then to change config is basically a case of ssh machine, kill old process, launche new process. Job done.<p>This makes each machine a dumb execution system, minimal state is contained in each node.<p>With NFS coming to AWS, that&#x27;ll be the model for my new infrastructure. the reason why? because it works.

If you don&#x27;t know how to make it rain, it&#x27;s fine to say or do whatever you want about it, but if you do, and it turns out to be possible and affordable -- and you need rain -- you should probably do something real about it. Same with sexism or racism. Since we are now familiar with many of the mechanisms by which they perpetuate themselves, and because we now understand how they shift power in society in ways that serve some at the expense of others -- assuming we believe enriching some at the expense of others is wrong -- we should do something about it, now that we understand the mechanisms.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t demand people accept my values, so I would settle for people understanding sexism yet deciding nothing should be done for whatever reason they deem justifiable. What I <i>do not</i> accept is people making things up (like &quot;it&#x27;s genetic&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s unavoidable&quot;, &quot;its unfixable&quot;) and using their unsubstantiated gut feelings in arguments like this.<p>> Would you please name between one and ten particular studies, journals, or &quot;world-famous researchers&quot; I can pursue to get a general overview without getting drowned in &quot;literally millions of hits&quot;?<p>Certainly (general overviews of advanced academic fields, however, are not usually given in academic journals or papers -- at least not that I&#x27;m familiar with -- but in books). There are two caveats, though. The first is that the field(s) of gender studies or racism studies is multidisciplinary; research is done as part of history, sociology, anthropology and psychology, and while those disciplines certainly interact, each of those disciplines has its own methodologies, and you’ll find few who are expert in all of them. The second caveat is that gender and race issues are rather advanced concepts, so a text is either an overview or an introduction (to one of the disciplines) but rarely both, just as it’s very hard to find overview texts about Quantum Mechanics that do not presuppose some basic understanding of physics and its methodologies or do not require many leaps of faith on account of the reader.<p>Having said that, let me try and address your request. While certainly not a scientific text, there is little doubt that 1949 book <i>The Second Sex</i>, by the French existentialist Simone de Beauvoir[1] laid the theoretical groundwork for much that followed, drawing people’s attention to the cultural constructs underlying sex differences in society. Another groundbreaking conceptual (though not scientific) work was done by Michel Foucault on the concept of “power”, which is now considered possibly the most important concept in all of the social studies. The wikipedia article on the topic[2] provides a nice overview.<p>To get to actual science, we need to look to the disparate disciplines separately. My background is history, so we’ll start there. The best way to find relevant research in history is to search for &quot;[topic] in [era [place (often implied)]]”. A lot of modern cultural constructs surrounding women (and race) are products of (or reaction agains) Victorian ideas, so a good place to start is with “women in the Victorian Era”; the Wikipedia page on the subject[3] is a nice introduction and has a nice bibliography. Historians sometimes track progression of ideas over several eras, so an interesting comparison is “women in the Middle Ages” (again, Wikipedia with bibliography[4]).<p>Next, we have psychology of sex differences, of which Wikipedia has an overview[5]. In sociology, I’ve found this nice course material (several parts with suggested readings and online resources)[6]. In anthropology, this[7] should provide an overview (though unlikely introductory).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Sex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Sex</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Victorian_era"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Victorian_era</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Middle_Ages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Middle_Ages</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_psychology</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://uncgsoc101.wordpress.com/module-8-gender-stratification/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://uncgsoc101.wordpress.com/module-8-gender-stratificat...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405101954.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405101954...</a>",1431407275

</code></pre>
There is a type mismatch. Github is a webservice with a RESTful API. Git is a tool for building distributed databases with an emphasis on availability rather than consistency.<p>If you have a project under Git source control and the only version is on Github then the project uses a remote repository but is not distributed. If you have a local repository in addition to one on Github then your project is distributed and in the event of a network partition (for example if Github goes down or your ISP goes offline) then the Git database is still available because you have access to the local repository.<p>Now suppose you have six developers on the project and each has a local repository and uses the repository on Github as a remote repository. If Github goes down, then the network is partitioned in a way that keeps the developers from seeing each other&#x27;s work...though each developer still has their local repository available. The important point is that Git doesn&#x27;t require a hub and spoke configuration. The six developers can each have access to the five repositories of the other developers plus Github. Though it could be a bit messy for systematic merging to achieve reasonable consistency, such a configuration would be robust in the face of partition.<p>A perhaps more practical possibility is to have a nearby Git server as a remote repository as well as Github and perhaps another server out on the interwebs...say on AWS...to provide redundancy against partition.<p>There are really two strong features of Github which Git facilitates. Internally, it provides a team with a remote backup. Externally, it provides an organization with content distribution. However Github&#x27;s centralized nature [it even has the word &quot;hub&quot; in it] makes it something less than a content distribution network and when it goes down it serves to illuminate the reasons that large long running open source projects mirror their content.",1431406841

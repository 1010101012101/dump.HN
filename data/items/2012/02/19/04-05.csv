Many young people just stay afloat without knowing where to go or what to do.<p>I used to have a similar desire: to work in a company that people were buzzing about (Microsoft, Google, Twitter, you know who they are). Had a few chances to try one big company and one start-up and decided they were not for me. I definitely do not want to spend most of my time thinking, living, breathing technology, learning every prog. lang. under the sun, have to prove myself against my colleagues (competition always exist)... and work lots of overtime.<p>I opted for a more stable job where I can exercise good software development practices and have more says on technical decisions. I have ""downtime"" once in a while where I can hone my skill further or polish the software we develop. The occasional downtimes give me great relief and a chance to clear my mind. When your mind is clear, you suddenly can explore other things: be it researching real-estate, learning how tax works, diversifying my financial portfolio, and basically being normal (socialising, etc). Those activities tend to open my mind to look at things beyond the technology world: other business opportunities outside hi-tech world.<p>I hope you're successful in achieving your goal though.

I'll address the rest of your comment now.<p><pre><code>  > First, there's an implicit value judgement that ""serving the poor"" is better than serving the ""middle class"".\n</code></pre>\nTypically, when cuts are being made, people across the political spectrum prefer to cut services for the middle class before cutting services for the poor. Most people agree that cutting services for the poor is a last resort. I am not arguing here that this is necessarily correct or that you have to agree, but that is the reason for the emphasis on ""serving the poor"" when discussing cuts to government programs.<p><pre><code>  > Universities are constantly wasting huge sums of money?\n</code></pre>\nAdministration costs, questionable research, credentialing, etc. That huge increase in tuition costs is going somewhere, isn't it?<p><pre><code>  > And why is the student loan system a criticism of the university rather than the financial aid system currently practiced in the US.\n</code></pre>\nThey are part of the same system. The connection between the increase in student loan limits and the increase in student tuition has been noted many times. See elsewhere in this thread.<p><pre><code>  > Who says people are expected to have degrees before they can do anything of value? Many of the most important innovators of our times do not have college degrees. And certainly nobody is erecting an unnecessary barrier to ""individual prosperity"".\n</code></pre>\nIn addition to what monochrome and yummyfajitas have said, anywhere you look, you can find job listings for relatively simple, entry-level positions that unnecessarily require university degrees. Ever since we started pushing the idea that <i>everyone</i> should go to college, we've seen a signaling arms race where you'd better get a college degree or face being passed over for someone else who did -- whether or not the job really needed someone with a degree. This is the unnecessary barrier. Now you have to spend money and time to get a degree just to keep up. If you can't do that, you're worse off.<p>Yes, many great innovators do not have college degrees. They help prove my point.<p><pre><code>  > Granting certifications to a few doesn't improve their prospects at the expense of others.\n</code></pre>\nOf course it does. yummyfajitas has covered this already.<p><pre><code>  > would've been impossible without all the academic research into computing and networking systems in the last few decades\n</code></pre>\nYou're suggesting the only possible way to do this kind of research is through the university system as currently structured.

Just like there is no Mr/Mrs Right. The good advice in this blog is that the secret to succeeding at something is to stop analyzing why you're failing and do it _as if_ you love it, as if you're doing it because you love it. That also happens to be the secret to a good relationship.",1329624973

Swipe your credit card on the device (PayAnywhere) and get SMS or Email'ed the receipt.<p>Why we're a good team for you: My co-founder Patrick and I have got the business side of things down. We have gotten excellent feedback pitching the company at DC Entrepreneurship Week. We have been accepted to Startup Chile (startupchile.org) granting us $40k. We have been in talks with restaurants and nightclubs who are on board and prepared to run a Zuldi beta.<p>We aren't just 2 business bums looking to bring on a developer. Patrick and I (Hartej) have gone through Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way, Python Osmosis, and are teaching ourselves how to code although we aren't anywhere close to being pros.<p>Looking for a developer with knowledge of iOS, HTML5, Java Script, SQL, how to utilize jquery, knowledge of server side language such as php, c#, java, and good object oriented java script. \nCurrently the prototype is being built solely in iOS.<p>Also, to be clear: We are NOT looking for someone who has a full-time job / freelance gigs, and wants to spend 10 hours a week on this with me as a cofounder. We are fully committed to this and want someone who is able to fully commit to it as well.<p>Why is this a great opportunity?: - We are offering equity in the company (terms to be discussed) -  A chance to take a project and help mold it into a success - Proven to obtain funding and if necessary will secure more funding. Who know's, 6 months from now we'll be sippin on drinks with Jay-Z at the 40/40 club as he utilizes Zuldi for bottle service (An actual possibility)<p>Interested in talking more?? Contact me at hartej@zuldi.com and let's get the dialogue started.<p>http://angel.co/s/7qTUEM",1329624959

If they don't, it's going to take a while. Part of the problem is that as you put it, most people don't care. And it's just too costly (in all senses of the word) to really educate people about ""computer stuff"". This is why we've been advocating user education for years and it hasn't worked.<p>So we say that we can't teach users not to shoot themselves in the foot. Cool. What are our other options? We can try to make it impossible for users to shoot themselves in the foot. But what we've found is that users ignore warnings. If you make the security restrictions too strict, users can't figure out how to evade them and deem the machine broken. If you make them too easy to circumvent, users go ahead and shoot themselves anyway. If you use a trusted computing architecture, user freedom is lost in such a way that it'd be better for people to be shooting themselves.<p>If you can't stop people from losing a limb, and you can't tell them how not to do so, what is the world to do?<p>EDIT: The only thing I can think of is to make computer education cheaper. And I don't mean in the monetary sense, I mean the mental sense. We need to find <i>some</i> way to get more people to care about computers, or make the concepts easier to teach, or make the materials easier to access, or make humans smarter, or <i>something</i>.<p>This is a problem I spend mental computer time on daily trying to solve.

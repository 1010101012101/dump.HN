10856442,comment,10852261,10855070,0,0,prostoalex,,,"> viciously increasing cycle of actor demands more -> prices go up -> more gross is made -> actor demands more.<p>That&#x27;s not exactly how movie economics works. The script calls for a male character, 30-40 years old, good-looking as he&#x27;s the subject of romantic story. The casting operation calls a few agents and comes back with data that Tom Cruise will want $3m, Ryan Philippe will want $2m, some known actor who&#x27;s currently in a TV series wants $500k, or a no-name actor showing promise will do it for $80k.<p>It&#x27;s up to the studio heads and producers to circle down on an option they consider reasonable. They are aware that a portion of movie revenues is generated by having a brand-name actor, i.e., there will be 200,000 extra tickets sold if Tom Cruise&#x27;s name is on it. Tom Cruise is also aware of this dynamics, which explains the premium.<p>But it&#x27;s also not <i>that</i> simple. Actors like to pretend they&#x27;re in this industry for the sake of &quot;art&quot;, not &quot;money&quot;, which means that if you have an interesting script and an &quot;artistic&quot; director with a potential of making to Sundance or Cannes, you might then get a brand-name actor for essentially free (you&#x27;ll have to pay some union-mandated salary). Every big name actor has this &quot;artistic&quot; no-budget movie in his belt, to showcase their &quot;range&quot; and to signal to public that it ain&#x27;t about the money, which leads to more public attention and larger check for the next franchise movie, as the actor is still &quot;hot&quot;.",1452149954

That aside...<p>There&#x27;s a reasonable perspective that says the type of problem that&#x27;s best solved in a language is a problem for which there&#x27;s good library support.  For that, I&#x27;d probably recommend scanning <a href=""https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md</a><p>But in my experience, where Haskell really shines is sketching out operations on some type that I know I&#x27;m going to get wrong - substantially or subtly - my first many tries.  When I go to fix it, the compiler helps me find everything I need to change in tandem, and feel ahead to find inconsistencies in my model before I get there in the code.  One example of this kind of problem is compilers - where we parse into an AST, transform the AST, and then produce other things from the AST.  As development goes on, the AST evolves, and you have a lot of help knowing what needs to change to match and what you can ignore.  I&#x27;ve recently been doing this for SQL (though with the goal of analyzing the queries, not producing an executable).",1452149443

The best explanation comes from Steve Lipner at Microsoft here:<p><a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2007/08/23/the-ethics-of-perfection/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2007/08/23/the-ethics...</a><p>The system he refers to is here:<p><a href=""http://www.cse.psu.edu/~trj1/cse543-f06/papers/vax_vmm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cse.psu.edu/~trj1/cse543-f06/papers/vax_vmm.pdf</a><p>The seL4 team certainly built tools to make the job easier. However, their work takes even more effort than the development of some early designs. Lipner and others indicated it took several quarters to turn a major change on a product. Schell&#x27;s company usually quoted 2 years per new design based on their highly-assured GEMSOS kernel. The STOP OS, INTEGRITY-178B, and VxWorks MILS similarly moved slowly in new features due to assurance requirements. Now, most of these were evaluated against all kinds of security and functional criteria whereas seL4 just did development assurance: other stuff for seL4 is ongoing research at NICTA while finished for alternatives. So, in some ways it&#x27;s less work and others it&#x27;s a lot of work.<p>So, rule of thumb is that you will have these issues: less features, slower development, slower time-to-market (critical weakness), slower maintenance, less HW support, possibly worse interface/management, and performance hits potentially. Also, worst part is that anything you apply high assurance to that hasn&#x27;t been dealt with in CompSci requires fresh R&D then the actual work. That with time-to-market and feature gap were huge, deal-breakers in the past.<p>So, all that might be fine depending on the nature of the problem. It might not even all show up in the project. Yet, you should assume it because it showed up in many projects and products before. Still does. It&#x27;s just that high assurance systems are precise, labor-intensive, custom developments that also require uncommon to rare expertise. No wonder seL4 is still behind even ancient QNX in what it can pull off and is actually behind the separation kernels in functionality. Assurance target just makes it that much harder.

It&#x27;s like bubbles in a glass of water that are all slowly rising. But it also seems like with everyone looking upward, we stop noticing that down below there are people whose bubbles are sinking down. Or maybe you&#x27;re actually closer to that reality and you&#x27;re fighting like hell not to fall below that line. And again, I would never question that choice.<p>But as a group what it adds up to is that there are families that are just trapped below that line.

But sometimes I worry that the attitude you describe is a little too easily accepted.",1452147053

10856304,comment,10841761,10845832,0,0,lao_tzu,,,"Most people don&#x27;t work jobs they care about. In an ideal world how people choose to spend their time would be entirely separate from notions of productivity or wages. But the fact is that we operate under a terrible economic system and people are overworked by largely meaningless jobs. In the context of society as it stands today, not only are people overworked, but most people could work less without their respective employers losing money. Because modern businesses operate solely off the principal of maximizing profit, I think it&#x27;s poignant to point out that it&#x27;s in their benefit to reduce the work week for their employees.<p>You can&#x27;t apply this notion to people who spend their time in meaningful ways. You couldn&#x27;t say that Picasso would be just as effective with a shorter work week. If people lived reasonable lives and did genuine work, the whole idea of comparing length of work weeks with effectiveness of work would be meaningless. You point out that when people are worn out with a certain activity, they could benefit by just moving on to another. That&#x27;s true. Reasonably speaking, people shouldn&#x27;t do anything for even a minute longer than they feel like. But the corporate world does not offer that kind of flexibility. The corporate world is rigid, and people are forced to operate in unnatural ways. Repetition and narrow focus are the bread and butter of this system, meaning you perform a single task over and over for the duration of your work day and that&#x27;s it. This is the context with which you must examine the idea that &quot;shorter work weeks are just as effective&quot; because this is how most jobs work. I think the reason for pointing out that &quot;shorter work weeks are just as effective&quot; is really to use the ruthless, disconnected, corporate logic of the modern business world against itself.<p>Now, let me just dispel a myth you stated. You believe that &quot;Given two equally talented people, the one that pursues a goal obsessively, for well over 40 hours a week, is going to achieve more.&quot; This again is modern corporate mentality. Work harder, put in more effort, and you will achieve more. The real world does not operate on these principals. Only menial tasks can be translated into the notion of more effort = higher yields. Lets take the example of Picasso again. Do you think the more time he spent painting in a given week the better his paintings were? Or take Newton. Do you think if he sat down and forced himself to ponder the physical laws of the universe for ten more hours each week he would have made more discoveries? This is a simplistic and completely insubstantial view on the world.<p>If you examine the lives of truly successful people (by which I mean people like Newton or Picasso or Tchaikovsky, not financially successful like Mark Cuban or Bill Gates) then you realize the only &quot;rule&quot; you can extrapolate from their lives is that people operate best when they do so on their own terms. Not when they work for longer hours or with more perceived &quot;effort&quot;, but when they work exactly as they please.<p>But anyway, that&#x27;s getting into another topic. I just wanted to point out that the idea that shorter work weeks are just as effective is completely valid when applied to the current and deeply flawed structure of modern work environments. It&#x27;s not something which can be applied to ideal scenarios which offer flexibility, and frankly that&#x27;s irrelevant because most people aren&#x27;t fortunate enough to have that. If we do get to the point where people can work under truly ideal circumstances, the entire notion of productivity or effectiveness will be meaningless. These are concepts which only hinder good work.",1452147020

So I just got a new Android Phone and since I got it, I have never for once set an alarm or reminder manually, I just do the &quot;Ok Google&quot; thingy and talk to it and boom, it&#x27;s all done. This made me realize that the user-interface as we know it today will slowly become obsolete and even more so when AI is embedded in the OS and an API is exposed so that third-party apps will be able to tap into it.<p>Let&#x27;s Imagine a future where the Android OS has become so advanced say v9.3 and has natural language API embedded that apps like say Uber can tap into, if you wanted to request for a ride, you wouldn&#x27;t need to tap silly buttons and drag a pin across a map, you would simply say &quot;Hello Uber I am going Trafalgar square, kindly request an Uber X to come pick me up&quot;<p>PS: I build android apps",1452146581

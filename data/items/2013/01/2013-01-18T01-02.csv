Given that password resets are probably only a small part of your site load, I'm dubious as to the utility of this optimisation.<p>* No server-stored tokens to secure - If an attacker manages to dump or partially break your database (SQLi, logic bug, whatever), they could extract the reset tokens and use them to gain access. Obviously, a full db exploit would make this unnecessary, and a proper reset implementation (that expires the tokens after use, sends confirm emails on use, etc) means unauthorised use would hopefully be detected.<p>In the info-hash-token, the only place it's ever actually stored is in the user's mail-box (and every email server involved in the process along the way, potentially), which might reduce the risk of disclosure, especially bulk (server dump) disclosure.<p>Any other advantages I might have missed? It's possible to do things like token expiry, invalidate on use, invalidate outstanding tokens using hashed tokens, but all of those things are fraught with danger.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5033266"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5033266</a>",1358471916

Two reasons for Java: generics and garbage collection. Generics are great for about 90% of what I do but templates provide similar flexibility and type-safety (better, really, than Java generics) while preserving fairly preposterous performance characteristics. And, generally speaking, I'm better at managing my memory than the runtime is in cases where I have a well-conceptualized object model[1] and a strong grasp of what's being done where; I can do without the overhead of stop-the-world garbage collection.<p>Lisp has similar object-lifecycle issues and (this is a personal beef) at least Common Lisp lacks strong static typing, so it's a non-starter. Worse than Java for my purposes.<p>Again, I dig these for where they're good, but C++ has a well-deserved stranglehold on its niche. It's not perfect--a project run by a friend of mine[2] is attempting to do it one better--but it hasn't become king of this area by accident.<p>[1] - A ""large application"" does not always mean a large set of objects and interactions.

By the looks of it, starting from a comment that shouldn't even have been that inflammatory (email pg. really.).<p>2. As to your comment and profile message:<p>I think a lot of what pushed the conversation towards ""mob justice"" instead of ""whether his actions should even have been a crime"" is that idealistic hackers <i>have</i> been making the argument to get rid of the CFAA and all other open-ended ""unauthorized access"" laws for quite some time, and are generally dismissed as unreasonable trolls. So rather than bringing up that same point again (which will still get dismissed out of hand by most people - I mean most people think that ""identity theft"" is actually a real thing!), ""we"" have to proceed on the assumption that those terrible laws are here to stay until digital natives become the majority, and can only hope to punish the prosecutorial bullying that made the threat of a three decade incarceration the price for a jury trial.",1358470949

But, specifically, I want to comment on the disconnect between legislators and reality caused by isolation from various aspects of everyday life due to the nature of specialization.<p>A lot of folks complain about lobbyist, but this a critically important role they play. They don't buy their votes as many suspect, they instead educate the congressmen they work with into believing what they believe. Or, a slightly more realistic phrasing is that they provide congressmen with the ideological ammunition they use on the floor and in the press to push their agenda.<p>In this case it's rather trivial, because currently 3d printed all plastic guns and magazines are mostly non-viable which explains why there are no lobbyist to help correct congress when they go astray. But the next time you call lobbying bad, just remember that lobbying is an important part of having informed legislatures.",1358470943

It was supposed to make configuration and connection of the Little Printer and other future Berg devices easier. As other commenters have pointed out, you can have an LP-type device that connects directly to a normal wifi network (e.g. Adafruit&#x27;s) and the content doesn&#x27;t in principle need to come from a remote web service either: it could be provided by a script running on a local machine.<p>The quality of presentation and the user experience provided by Berg (not just this product but other things the same guys have worked on) is great, but they show their roots in the design school. The products feel to me more like the product of brainstorming at an ad agency than a mature response to necessity. London&#x27;s design scene is full of this kind of &quot;creative&quot; activity, and it&#x27;s super enjoyable to watch but probably a form of decline or decadence in terms of real manufacturing and craft. The pace of change is so great now in tech that designers tend to get left behind or reinvent the wheel.<p>Imagine Twitter redesigned by someone both technically knowledgeable _and_ UX aware.

Unfortunately DSLR&#x27;s build environment does not seem like the easiest to understand for first-timers.<p>For example, instead of Makefiles per package, there&#x27;s a package-specific shell script which incorporates some magic from scripts/build_package and is then sourced by the same to add some functions, with references to patches in a separate directory, and build dependencies tracked by a Makefile.deps file that&#x27;s included by the root Makefile before the build_package script is run, which incidentally has tons of package-specific logic built in. You&#x27;d be re-reading 10 files over and over any time you build or troubleshoot a package.<p>All of this inside of a chroot using a bootstrapped cross compiler, which lord knows most people have never dealt with before. And the dependencies for building the cross-compiler aren&#x27;t built from  source, meaning this isn&#x27;t a fully bootstrapped build environment, to say nothing of tracking versions.

So I could have stayed in a B&B during the week, however I felt that this would work out. My wife was not quite in love with the idea of the camper van as much as I was. It would save a lot of money which we needed at the time.<p>So I went down there in September for a 3 month contract that got extended by another 3 months.<p>The most complicated issue was that the Webasto diesel heating system (2kw heater and amazinf) required leisure batteries to be at a certain level to work safely and would shut down. So I started off with an 80w battery by the middle of December I had added another two 110w batteries and bought a industrial strength battery charger to enable me to top the batteries up within a 24 hour period.<p>If I was living in the van permanently I would have mounted two 250w solar panels on the roof. Complete independence would have been worth it.<p>One thing, having a home base also gave me a place to empty the chemical loo.<p>Of note, it completely changed my view of sealed sachets of ketchup and coffee. As you are in a box, you can build up a lot of moisture during the night (easy to remove during the day) but just means windows are dripping or even frozen with moisture.<p>I can remember firing up the heater and directing the heat into the driver cabin via a funnel to help melt the ice that had formed over night on the inside of the screen, leaving the van and going for a walk along the beach while it cleared itself.",1410270024

8289918,comment,8289577,8289577,83,0,awjr,,,"I did this on a 6 month contract as an experiment over a mild winter in the UK in 2011. You can pretty much do this anywhere.<p>Couple of tricks:\n1) Get a small camper/van that can park in one car parking space with a diesel heating system. Kitchen is irrelevant. Bed/toilet/heating system/space to sit and type/space for clothes to hang.<p>2) You need a toilet but usually you time your bowel movements to only need to use it as a urinal unless you decide to go for a crazy hot curry<p>3) Find a local sports centre (not gym) with a sauna. Go for a swim in the morning, spend the evenings working out or hanging out in the sauna (you get regulars).<p>4) Bank of leisure batteries in your van (to drive the heater and give your laptop power), can give you the power to live for weeks inside your van. Luckily I went home every weekend to recharge them. If you can&#x27;t get a power source connection (friend etc.), then consider covering your roof in solar power cells.<p>5) Unlimited mobile data plan that allows tethering.<p>6) Clubs/Meetup/Work social groups (CRITICAL).<p>7) No it&#x27;s not &#x27;hot&#x27; to invite a girl back to your van in a car park.<p>8) Scout the areas and work out where to sleep. Sleeping on a road can mean you get traffic buzzing you from 5am. Go find a really quiet road or lay by. Use retail park car parks if they don&#x27;t have security patrols. Remember you&#x27;re parking up at work during the day. You only really turn up after the gym at 8pm or later and leave by 8am.<p>9) It&#x27;s quite liberating. Want to wake up next to the sea and go for a swim....yes you can.<p>10) Be proud of what you are doing. The limited space you have frees you from clutter.<p>11) Do crazy things...like continue to run an ebay magic card sales business inside the van!<p>12) Cold is your enemy. When winter hit hard, the issue was the driver cabin and the rear doors. Two cheap double duvets insulated the rest of the van from those cold spaces.<p>13) Go stealth mode if possible. No windows on the sides of the van, roof windows are perfect. You want somebody to think there is no one in the van.<p>14) Layout can be interesting, but I prefer bed at back on a removable platform, storage under neath, rear door &#x27;insulated&#x27;. Sliding door opens into a space with bench and toilet under bench. Blackout curtains between driver cabin and rear area. Lockable from the inside.<p>15) Always go for a van you can stand in.<p>16) Check your drinking laws. In the UK sleeping in the back of a van is legal if drunk.<p>17) Going to repeat this. Scout out your area and work out great un-disturb-able places. A quiet car park in the centre of town may have a lot of pedestrians walking through it at 2am going back from clubs. Go for those parks/spaces that are not natural through routes. You will get into a routine. You&#x27;ll end up parking in the same place on the same night of the week.<p>18) Be social. Get out of that space. Do not go back to the van and lock yourself away and watch stuff on the internet. GET OUT.<p>[edit] This was the van: <a href=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/306924_10150370608981281_637005_n.jpg?oh=9ae9541b5afe125be1e09fea80599cb8&oe=54893FE7&__gda__=1419678336_1a6368d26d18e73834a30006f5138c8e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1....</a><p>Slightly on the big side, but it worked at the time. If I was going to do it again, I would custom build. Height for me being 6&#x27;2 is always going to be an issue. I would consider a normal height van but bending over all the time is not my thing.",1410268377

8289916,comment,8289577,8289724,6,0,notacoward,,,"&quot;Meeting people outside of the tech industry keeps you grounded&quot;<p>But does <i>where you sleep</i> affect that at all?  Even where I am, many people live in apartments or houses and yet have almost no social interaction outside of high tech.  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s at least as true in Silicon Valley, with its corporate citadels and meetups and apartment complexes that specifically court techies with fast networks etc.<p>Civic/community/social engagment is driven by where you spend your time <i>between work and sleep</i> (assuming you have any).  It&#x27;s family, old friends, neighbors, fellow sports team members or music fans or craft companions who aren&#x27;t all from the same few companies.  You can interact with all of those people even if you live in your car, whether that car is in the Google parking lot or elsewhere.  You can <i>fail</i> to interact with them even if you live in a real home.<p>The only way your choice of sleeping arrangements might matter is if the security folks think it&#x27;s odd when you come back from elsewhere and go straight to your car without going into the building first.  That&#x27;s not a normal commuter pattern, so it might pique their interest.  On the other hand, as one of the Quora commenters said, if you just show them your company ID they don&#x27;t care any more.",1410268349

8289905,comment,8289577,8289744,6,0,netcan,,,"Rent in central cities is one of the unintuitive outcomes of the modern economy. SV might be an extreme example, but it isn&#x27;t the only one. The world is far more globalized. People work with clients, customers, and coworkers mostly through the internet, even if they are in the same building or city.<p>Google&#x27;s a good example. They have offices all over. They have clients everywhere.<p>Common sense would dictate that employees would be easier to hire for the same cost elsewhere where that salary affords a better lifestyle. With all due respect to SF (last time I visited I was 12), there are lots of places where a $140k salary will get you the best schools for kids, entertainment for the adults and palatial digs. It is quite literally like doubling you salary to take it someplace else, even within the US.<p>I wonder what the reasons are. Obviously clusters matter. There&#x27;s the tautology that everyone wants what everyone wants. Being someplace vibrant and affluent is valuable to the resident & employees (or resident-employees). I also think that nominal salaries are important to people&#x27;s decision making. A 25% pay cut from relocation resulting in a 10% cut in after tax salary but a real measurable and provable increase in purchasing power still feels like a 25% pay cut.<p>Interesting.",1410268132

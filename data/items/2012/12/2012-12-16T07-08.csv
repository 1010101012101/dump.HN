Last I checked, Chrome is fully supported, and whatever internet explorer comes with it is SURELY supported.... it'd be huge news if they didn't.<p>> And Google knows IMAP is pathetic as a replacement for mail.<p>Is it? It's much better than POP3, and to my knowledge it supports every feature of GMail I use but search and different star (""flag"") colors. Syncing does suck, but that's syncing, not IMAP. I can't imagine downloading 2 gigs of email would be much better with another protocol.<p>> But as it stands today Google only believes in open standards when they aren't in a strong market position.<p>Hey, it's better than doing what Microsoft has done traditionally- i.e. using their strong market position to lock customers into closed systems.<p>But I'm really not trying to take sides in this matter- the customer gets hurt no matter who the target is. I just think that saying ""Google is screwing over Windows users"" is disingenuous; that's clearly not their intention (which is ""Google is trying to manipulate Microsoft.""). Microsoft is no longer the biggest kid on the playground, and they can't expect everyone to license their tech, especially when most mail-reading devices are probably not windows devices.",1355644774

Call this, ""getting lost in stories.""<p>I say this because there is a surrender when you are being mindful. You are surrendering the thought -- rather than surrendering <i>to</i> the thought -- yet somehow, that which witnesses -- experiences -- the thought remains without effort. I used to think, being mindful requires a sort of force, a way of isolating what you are doing here and now. That does not work, a good way to make your mind rigid enough to shatter. And thankfully, not something most people can sustain for long periods of time without becoming exhausted.<p>When you start meditating, a stream of thought shows up like a train wreck and you get carried along with it. You get lost in stories. Stories and narratives about this and that, why you should do this or that, why this thing happened or that person said this. Making up interpretations of things. Correcting and analyzing your practice as you are practicing. Very comfortable for nerds -- very comfortable for <i>most</i> people -- but still lost in stories. That's mindlessness.<p>In the deeper states, the ""stories"" you get lost in start taking on qualities of lucid dreams. That's why there are Zen koans like:<p><pre><code>  A student was meditating and saw visions 
  of horrors and hell. Terrified, he ran to 
  his teacher. The teacher listened and told 
  him, ""Let it go.""

  A few days later, the student was meditating 
  and saw visions of heaven. He was blissing out, 
  totally high as waves of pleasure ran through 
  him. Suddenly, he felt his teacher hit him on 
  the head. ""Let it go.""

This ""train wreck"" of a thought stream, once going on, is very difficult to suppress. By that point, you don't want to suppress it. It's more of riding it out because in time, that too shall pass.<p>That's also why you have quotes from say, the Tao Te Ching, ""A journey of ten thousand miles begin with the single step."" Americans and the Chinese love this quote, often taking it to mean that to achieve great things, you must start with that first step. It's just that, at a different level, it is also teaching you how to not get lost in stories. The verse runs like this:<p><pre><code>  It's easy to keep hold of what hasn't stirred,
  easy to plan what hasn't occurred.
  It's easy to shatter delicate things,
  easy to scatter little things.
  Do things before they happen.
  Get them straight before they get mixed up.

  The tree you can't reach your arms around
  grew from a tiny seedling.
  The nine-story tower rises
  from a heap of clay.
  The ten-thousand-mile journey
  begins beneath your foot.

  (Verse 64, trans. by Ursula K Le Guin)
</code></pre>
It is very easy to take that ten-thousand-mile journey and get lost in your stories. Stuff of flame wars and new operating systems :-)<p>It is also noting that, as your powers of observation and concentration grows, you will be able to observe these thoughts, emotions, and sensations closer to when they are ""born"". And releasing them before they become something strong enough that you can only ride out its fury.<p>There's another side to this. Part of mindfulness, that is, of insight practice (rather than concentration practice), is to probe into the artifacts of your mind. For a stream of thought, you can observe what constitute ""thought."" You probe into the underlying emotions and the symphony of sensations. If you pay attention, you'll find that emotions and physical sensations precede the ""thought"", and that the ""stream of thoughts"" is not as real or tangible as you normally experience it.<p>See through that bullshit long enough, you start noticing a lot of things in your day to day life are simply BS. Or how you, and no one else, are the one who made yourself unhappy, or fearful, or angry, or sad. Easy to observe when you're sitting still, much harder when you are talking to flesh-and-blood people. Actually applying what you learned on the cushion into day to day life will take lifetimes, more difficult than anything else you will ever learn, and more fun and adventurous.",1355642783

I believe that if he hadn't grown up in a wealthy privileged environment, he'd be dead or roaming the streets today.<p>IQ tests put him in the ~120-130 range, and psychologists recommended a wide array of solutions, ranging from the behavioral (for example one determined that it was because he didn't feel secure and had enough privacy, and suggested that he should get locks for his room etc.- that led to an entire different set of complications, and that psychologist was abandoned promptly.) to the medical (although he was never subjected to the wide variety of antidepressants cited in the article- France in the 90s-early 00s seemed to avoid those sort of things).<p>Ultimately, nothing worked.

Atoms could not exist either.<p>The reason is that as you go faster you have more energy (obviously) and since you have more energy your mass increases. Since your mass increases you need even more energy to increase your speed (since now you weigh more).<p>Take that to the limit and you find that as you reach the speed of light your mass goes to infinity.<p>So it's necessary that it's impossible to exceed the speed of light - for example if you had two objects each traveling at 51% of the speed of light (relative to third placed in between them). Then relative to each other they are going faster than light - which means they have more than infinite energy.<p>Can't do that.<p>So relativity is necessary if you want mass to be interchangeable with energy.",1298271127

It is not just either a site kills Facebook or it does not. I don't think hype around Facebook can kill entrants. If the entrants dies, it will be because of their own poor execution or just having something that users don't need. The fact is, if you create something that users want and you can spread the word about it, you will get the users, regardless of how big other websites are.
You do have to understand why Facebook is so popular.

I do a decent amount of interviews (maybe 2-3 a month), and we by and large are looking for people who can think through a problem, defend a solution, ask good questions, not give up, and appear to be cool to work with. That's it. Some of these questions are great, fundamental CS stuff that I would expect any engineer to have in their back pocket, but some are trivia. Trivia is great, but if you dont't know it I wouldn't hold it against you.

2244469,comment,2244304,2244304,0,0,jerf,,,"Another way to look at it that is arguably simpler (and with greater loss, of course): Imagine the XY plane with every point described by integers in both X and Y marked. That is, (0, 0), (1, 4), (-2, -5), etc. Connect each of them to their four neighbors with a line segment. Now suppose you are at (3, 4) and you want to move to (4, 5), and you may only use the lines given to you. You move to the right, you move up, you're there. And you can move the other way, too, all the line segments are bi-directional.<p>That works in space; that does not work in time. You can't stop moving or change direction in time. You can put X and Y on that grid and have something meaningful, but you can't say it's X and T; that would imply the ability to freely move back in time or forward at your discretion, which is not true.<p>A simplified explanation of space and time's actual shape is that when you are at (3, 4) and you are moving through time (in the first coordinate, let's say), you've got lines that lead to (4, 4.1) and (4, 3.9) and so on, but the lines only go to a certain angle, which for simplicity's sake I'll say is the obvious 45 degree angle, which means you've got lines that go to (4, 3) and (4, 5), but nothing else below 3 or above 5. You can only move along those lines, and as there is no line to (4, -2) from your start position, there is no way to get there. The bound of those lines is the speed of light. The pictures of the ""light cone"" you may have seen are in some sense not merely a helpful picture but actually a true picture of the universe.<p>You can not move faster than the speed of light because you can only move between connected points in the universe, and to move faster than the speed of light is to bypass that restriction. The universe is literally not shaped that way. The shape of the universe forbids faster-than-light. You don't have any choices other than those lines and none of the lines go faster than light.<p>This is a grotesque simplification, but I think the core point is accurate. Exceeding the speed of light is impossible for reasons above and beyond the mere ""exceeding the speed of sound"" or other things were. To travel faster than the speed of light requires <i>changing the shape of the universe</i>. (And to the extent that certain theories permit it under some circumstances, such as the Alcubierre drive theory[1], I suspect that we'd find that even if we could implement one of these things the universe would still find a way not covered in those theories to shut it down, cosmic-censorship-style[2], or like [3]. I would also note that all ""practical"" FTL drives proposed to date have inevitably required the existence of at least one impossibility, such as stable negative mass, and it means little to prove that if I have one impossibility like stable negative mass I can have another like FTL.)<p>Also, because this is a grotesque simplification, please note that picking apart holes in my picture is not even remotely the same as picking apart holes in the theory of relativity, let alone picking apart holes in the Universe. In particular don't get caught up with things that may appear to be going backward; that's an illusion of this attempt to embed an explanation into Euclidean space, not a real problem with the physics.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_censorship"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_censorship</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=_mo4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA132&lpg=PA133&ots=MPipJx9GjV&dq=hawking+wormhole+time+machine+vacuum+explosion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=_mo4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA132&#...</a> (reading pages 132 and 133)",1298269095

Also, I don't see a reason why downvotes should require any more justification than upvotes.  If people hardly ever downvote, then the way to get a lot of karma is to write a <i>lot</i> of comments.  If there's anything the internet provides more than enough of it's volume.  I'd gladly sacrifice half the commenting volume in exchange for higher comment quality, but an upvote-only system gets the opposite.<p>Worse still, if downvotes are rare, then many of the top comments will be those that are particularly controversial or divisive since readers who agree will upvote, but many who disagree just don't feel like taking the time to write a note or counterpoint.

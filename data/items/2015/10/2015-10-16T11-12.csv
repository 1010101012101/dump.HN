10398689,comment,10398008,10398008,0,0,moron4hire,,,"This style of problem is probably the most common sort used to demonstrate genetic algorithms. It is also not a very good use for GAs.<p>When GAs are applied in this way--i.e. generating a goal state directly, with a known goal state to which they are compared directly, generating a fitness value that is nothing more than progress towards the goal state--then the GA is no longer a GA. It becomes not much more than an inefficient hill climbing with a smattering of random walk thrown in.<p>These sorts of problems get used in demonstrations because they are simple to understand. We get to spend more effort on the mechanics of annealing, breeding, running generations, etc, without having to spend significant effort on the fitness function. But the fitness function is where most of the real work of applying GA to novel problems actually lies (after figuring out how to model solutions as genes without a linear dependency between alleles). It&#x27;s also a fundamental component of neural networks (the ability to evaluate not just whether a solution is right or wrong, but to give a value for how much right or wrong). So personally, I find such demos to be woefully incomplete.",1444996687

The suggestion that they broke federal rules by fudging proficiency-testing is the icing on the cake.<p>On the other hand, the suggestion that they broke the rules is merely an allegation. On the topic of the company&#x27;s progress towards it&#x27;s stated goals, science is hard and a ten-plus-year time horizon doesn&#x27;t appear unreasonable for achieving the objective Theranos is aiming for. Plus, they <i>have</i> successfully rolled out the HSV1 test. It&#x27;s seems reasonable to expect that more will follow.<p>I am instinctively skeptical of founders who seem to focus more on cultivating their media profile than on getting their heads down and actually delivering. There <i>are</i> people whose overriding motivation is maximising media exposure but who completely lack the ability to deliver what they promise. Sometimes their behaviour is down to naiveté, over-confidence, self-delusion or a deep-rooted desire for celebrity, fame or recognition (such people seem to wear the CEO &quot;brand&quot; in the same way that others wear Dolce & Gabbana or Prada). Othertimes, they&#x27;re simply con-artists, looking to fleece gullible customers or investors.<p>Given that Theranos has gained FDA approval for the HSV1 test, and the suggestion that they broke federal rules is unproven, I think Holmes deserves the benefit of the doubt. Her principal crime appears to be that she was a bit naive in making overly optimistic promises and embracing the celebrity CEO role, which has made her a target for schadenfreude.",1444995897

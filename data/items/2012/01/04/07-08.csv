3423256,comment,3423160,3423160,5,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Well first his metaphor doesn't really hold weight.  Selling a Used Book is a one-to-one transaction in which the receiver is getting a less than perfect copy.  Putting an e-book on a p2p network is a one-to-many transaction that transmits a perfect copy each time.<p>But that doesn't necessarily invalidate his overall point.<p>As far as his larger point is concerned I don't think I can say he's right or wrong.  What I can say is he's not really looking at the deeper issues.<p>The real issue behind piracy is societal values.  Those who advocate this opinion are basically saying people only have the right to profit from their creations to recover their costs.  Beyond that the content belongs to society.  That's the only justification for piracy (since you're arguing the cost of distribution is so low the user doesn't need to be compensated for it)<p>You can dress that up with arguments about fans loving artists and giving them additional revenue streams but since those additional revenue streams are separate transactions that may or may not occur you can't use them as justification for not paying an artist initially for his/her creation.<p>Beyond that there's the issue of choice.  Even if all the pro-piracy arguments are true there will be some artists who simply don't want their work pirated.  Even if it's irrational (look at artists like AC/DC who still refuse to sell their music digitally).  By imposing piracy on those artists you're again saying their art belongs to society once created.<p>So that brings us back to the question of societal values. Do we as a society believe content should belong to the entire society upon creation or does it belong to the creator who can choose to distribute it in the way they see fit (even if that means handing it over to a record company or some other corporate entity)?",1325663937

Salesforce something?<p>I do agree that the lower hourly rate you seek/accept/charge to clients, generally the worse quality clients you get. Clients that want lower rates tend to be more clueless, less experienced, more tight-fisted with cash, more likely to try scope creep on every milestone, and they tend to concentrate too much on rate but not on total hours or quality or other positive qualities. They're more likely to think hard things are simple and simple things hard.

Since  hash(password) is stored in the server DB, the attacker can  just copy that and use it to login later. He just needs the hash, not the plain-text password to compute what the server asks for during authentication.<p>The above goal can be achieved by public-key cryptography.

For everything else, destruction is a no-op and you can just let the GC re-use the object's memory.  And if the destructor is used pretty much just for side effects (closing files & sockets etc.), these will typically be rare & pose little overhead.<p>Would suck in a dynamically-typed language, though, because you have no idea whether a reference points to an object with or without a destructor, and so always have to pay the overhead of checking and possibly decrementing the refcount.  I don't really see this working without a static type system.<p>BTW, you're often better off with explicitly-scoped destruction (eg. the Ruby & Python way) than refcounting, for the same reason that boost::shared_ptr can be tricky and Java programs can leak memory.  If you don't have clear object ownership & lifetimes, it's very easy to stash a reference to an object in some longer-lived object (a cache, for example) and accidentally hold onto it way longer than anticipated.",1325662197

3423173,comment,3421843,3422209,10,0,jcr,,,"Daniel, I know you mean well, but your suggestion of ""flag sparingly"" is\nonly useful some of the time, and there is code in place to handle those\nwho flag excessively. As always, there's more to it than meets the eye.<p>There is a great deal of ""secret sauce"" running on HN, and to prevent\nadversaries from abusing HN for their own gain, PG <i>deliberately</i> does\nnot publicly divulge how a lot of things work. [1] You would need to\nhave either a deep fascination with discussion forums, or far too much\nfree time (probably both) to figure out some of the non-public details\nof how HN really works. If one really does their homework well and\nfigures out some of the details, hopefully they have enough respect for\nPG, YC and all of the folks using HN to not abuse or divulge what they\nlearn.<p>Though the precise details are not public information, pg has publicly\nstated that he does have some form of (vote/flag) ""ring detection""\nrunning here on HN to thwart group and/or multi-account manipulation.\n[2] Since the details are not public, there is really no way to know\nhow effective the ring detection is, but suffice to say, if it wasn't an\nimprovement, it wouldn't exist.<p>When it comes to flagging and up-voting of submissions, the publicly\ndescribed logic is both clever and fascinating. If you flag heavily\nup-voted submissions, your flags count less. Similarly, if you flag too\nmany things (and most likely, too quickly), your flags count less. In other\nwords, there are thresholds employed. [3,4]<p>When it comes to flagging comments, I can't recall seeing any mention of\nhow the comment flags are handled, and worse, there's nothing in my\nnotes about it. Considering the potential for abuse, I doubt PG will\never give vague details about it. Spam comments are an interesting\nproblem, and it's very difficult to solve. Allowing users to flag\ncomments is one way to handle it, but divulging the details would most\nlikely reduce the effectiveness of the counter-measures.<p>There is still one place on HN where doing a lot of flagging and\nup-voting of submissions is both useful and beneficial to HN as a whole,\nnamely, on the ""new"" page: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newest</a><p>I'm sure many people appreciate the high signal to noise ratio here on\nHN, and would rather avoid the more noisy /newest page. None the less,\npeople putting in some time to both flag spam and give up-votes to new\nsubmissions is what keeps the high signal to noise on the front page.<p>Yes, even if you're just flagging spam on the /newest page, you can\nstill trigger the ""excessive flagger"" threshold, and the result is\n(was?) the ""flag"" links disappear. I had it happen to me once a long\ntime ago, but since then, I believe the system was changed to simply not\ncount the flags once a user has passed the threshold value. I would bet\na human being (pg or a moderator) looks at any account that flags too\nmuch to determine if the account should be banned, hell banned, deleted,\nor whatever. If they see that you're really just trying to flag the\nendless spam submissions, they probably just quietly appreciate your\nefforts. I've never received a gilded thank you note for flagging spam\nsubmissions, and I don't expect to get one, but I'm sure everyone who\nlikes the high signal to noise ratio around here appreciates it.<p>NOTE: Though the references below are from PG himself, it's entirely\npossible that he's changed his mind, and his code, since they were\noriginally posted.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830838"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830838</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3354900"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3354900</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830485"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830485</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830531"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830531</a>",1325661710

3423153,comment,3421882,3422213,40,0,scottdw2,,,"Generally speaking, unilateral provisions in contracts render the contract unenforceable by the party they benefit. The fundamental principal behind common law contracts is the ""bargain principal"". There must be some ""consideration"" paid by both parties before a contract is valid (I will give you this, in consideration for your giving me that). A clause in a contract that said, ""we have the right to breach this contract at any time we choose"" would render the contract void, because there is no ""bargin"" involved. Such types of promise (a promise to give something with nothing in return) are called ""charity"" and are not enforced by law. You can tell Jery Lewis, ""I promise to give you $20 at your next telethon"", but he can't sue you if you don't pay.<p>So... that means that the either:<p>1) The provision in the contract can't mean ""we have the write to breach whenever we feel like it""<p>2) or, that the TOS are unenforceable.<p>The wording in the TOS is designed specifically to not mean ""we can breach whenever we want"", but instead to mean ""if you sell counterfeit goods through our service we will destroy them and not refund your money"".<p>The words ""we ... reasonably believe the item you sold is counterfeit"" were deliberately chosen for this purpose. The fact that paypal can use its sole discretion just tips the scales in their favor. If they have reasonable evidence that something is fake, then they can destroy it, even if they haven't done due diligence to prove it's a fake.<p>The question comes down to wether or not paypal had reason to believe the item was counterfeit.<p>Their are certain cases where only a customer complaint would  be sufficient to establish a ""reasonable believe"".<p>For example, if Picasso bought a painting that was said to be a Picasso original, and he called paypal and said ""I didn't paint this, it's a fake"", they would definetly be within their rights if they distroyed it, even if further investigation could have revealed he was lying.<p>In this particular case... you could potentially argue that the customer's complaint was in no way sufficient for paypal to reach a ""reasonable believe"".

Either you really don&#x27;t understand how DNS works, or you are simplifying to the point of just plain being wrong.<p>You could argue that the root servers are too centralized, and that their control constitutes centralized DNS control, but since the only reason they have control is that all the different DNS servers use them as authorities, an argument could also be made that their control is more be convention than anything else, and all it would take is a competitor to ICANN that added some value, and eventually we could have multiple authorities.  Whether that would be beneficial or detrimental is another discussion.",1433786396

In an FRP system, you define a directed acyclic graph of values, where the edges are dependencies from one value to another.  So, when an event enters the system at one of the graph&#x27;s roots, only the things that depend on it will be updated.<p>Furthermore, you can avoid unnecessary re-computation via the usual techniques like memoization.  One of the big advantages of the &quot;virtual DOM&quot; is that we get to build documents using a real programming language, not some HTML templating system.",1433786380

We use machine learning and NLP techniques to algorithmically understand the meaning behind content and make sense of people&#x27;s wide and nuanced interests based on their behavior.<p>Advertising supports the free web, but most of it is terrible.  The most prevalent form of digital advertising is the display ad, a bolt-on that damages the user&#x27;s experience and is typically irrelevant to their context.  We believe engaging content is the future of online monetization, and our first product is an intelligent ad engine for revenue-generating content.<p><i>What is the job?</i><p>You&#x27;ll be identifying, building and owning new and existing parts of our product.  This can be anything from developing our data collection, processing, and machine learning infrastructure, all the way through to designing how we present analytics on our front-end product.<p>At least some of the following should excite you(!):<p>* Working extensively in functional languages (we mostly use Scala, with Akka, Spray, Scalaz; some Haskell)<p>* Building large-scale distributed systems (we run a microservices architecture on AWS)<p>* Designing and/or implementing proprietary machine learning models and real-time personalized recommendation systems<p>* Rapidly designing and building front-end product features<p><i>What do we offer?</i><p>We have a ton of interesting problems to solve.  We&#x27;re constantly ingesting vast numbers of documents to learn from, tracking millions of interactions with content, computing the interests of millions of users, and making personalized real-time recommendations. This scale impacts every engineering decision we make, and we&#x27;re looking to build a company with super-smart people excited by the challenges it poses.<p>As our first engineers you&#x27;ll play a central role in defining our tech culture and direction.  There&#x27;s a huge opportunity to effect change at scale through real responsibility and ownership of product.  And because at this early stage there&#x27;s so much to do, there&#x27;s so much to learn and room to grow.<p>We&#x27;re based in London, just off Brick Lane. We have our own office and you&#x27;ll get a shiny new laptop of your choice, monitor(s), and your own desk.

I find that there are (at least) two types of babies/young children. I call them chill babies and intense babies. If you get a chill baby then you can expect a subjectively normal pace of achieving milestones and overall less trouble. I&#x27;m not saying its easy with a chill baby, but its overall your stress levels will be lower. If you get an intense baby, you really need to take a step back and play the long game. They will take longer to get to the milestones, they will try your patience more, they will be more frustrating to respond to your inputs. Its like there is something interfering with their response system. While this can feel like you are doing things wrong at first, it can be confirmed when people give you advice about sleeping, eating, or gas and its clear they&#x27;ve never experienced what you are going through. Also, if you have one of each like I do, you can make the mistake of thinking that one is normal and that there is something wrong with the intense baby. Don&#x27;t worry about the intense baby&#x27;s lack of milestones or responses the odds say they will come out all right.

For instance, Yarvin&#x27;s &quot;favorite primary source on slavery&quot; is Nehemiah Adams, which he quotes in the most cryptic way possible, leaving out the fact that the book --- particularly in the context he cites it in --- is essentially an attempt to paint slavery as a benevolent condition. Look at their clothes! Look at their happy faces! They don&#x27;t seem downtrodden at all!<p>Maybe &quot;approver of slavery&quot; is a less apt description than &quot;whatever slavery&#x27;s equivalent of a holocaust denier is&quot;.<p>Your response to this could be informed by the knowledge that the Adams reference is one of many others I could have chosen to highlight.<p>Again, I could just be misreading all of this. Yarvin surely made that easy to do.<p>Ultimately, my argument throughout much of this thread is straightforward, so I&#x27;d like to restate it as we delve further into the weeds: Yarvin&#x27;s writing isn&#x27;t a case where people have worked hard to mine unsavory associations from ambiguously worded old blog posts.

Of course these things can themselves vary significantly from one jurisdiction to the next.<p>Secondly, there is always a risk that the information on the summary site becomes out of date.<p>Thirdly, the choice of which points to highlight and whether to present them as positive or negative often seems rather arbitrary and perhaps guided by the preferences of the TOSDR operators.<p>An example of being out of date would be the Steam entry, which says &quot;No refund policy&quot; despite this being changed a few days ago.<p>As an example of the final point about subjectivity, several sites are given a thumbs down for claiming varying degrees of rights to content you upload, yet Wikipedia is given a thumbs up for publishing your content under a free licence. Given actual laws with regard to giving credit/claiming authorship (moral rights/author&#x27;s right/your local equivalent if you have one) that exist in many jurisdictions in addition to the usual copyright provisions, I&#x27;m not sure I see a big difference here in practice.<p>Several of the points raised, sometimes repeatedly, as negatives are also routine in B2C contracts and indeed probably necessary for the services to provide their intended functions -- the ability to change terms, for example, or transferring users&#x27; data in the event of an exit. In many jurisdictions there are legal safeguards that would allow for challenging unreasonable TOS changes or disclosures regardless of what any terms say, but the idea that any commercial service is going to fix its terms for all eternity with no mechanism for changing them even with notice is just silly (not to mention legally impossible almost everywhere), as is the idea that a business will promise not to transfer data about its users to any new owner.",1433785242

Backups were another hassle.<p>Now? Click &quot;New Database&quot; and select a performance and HA level. Done. Look at StackExchange - they just scaled the DB up cause RAM is cheap enough to put a TB in a server. That&#x27;s vastly easier than dealing with scaling out. And even to scale out, &quot;cloud&quot; DBs like SQL Azure have sharding and auto-scale built-in.<p>On top of that, servers are MUCH faster. Look at the RPS that some sites are claiming. They simply aren&#x27;t that high. 1000 RPS? 10 years ago that required some planning. Now, so long you don&#x27;t do dumb things, it&#x27;s not an issue.

This all worked well when (a) the web was small and (b) there were (hardly) no trash pages.<p>Search engines changed that, and once they got &#x27;good enough&#x27; the link graph became a mere starting point for crawling the web rather than the way we navigated from site to site. For a little while the link graph was used as a popularity measurement but this too changed (because of the huge number of low value links).<p>Then we got silos. A &#x27;silo&#x27; is a bunch of data locked up under a trade between users and large web properties. The trade is &#x27;you give us your content and a bunch of information about yourself and we&#x27;ll use that content to attract others and to sell ads&#x27;.<p>Examples of such silos are Google, Yahoo and Facebook.<p>Finally, if originally (and the internet itself) was strung together by a peer-to-peer approach it turned more and more into a division between producers and consumers, with the producers on the &#x27;server&#x27; side and the consumers on the &#x27;client&#x27; side.<p>Mobile devices accessing the net further accelerated this trend, right now the only internet (not web) applications that are still peer-to-peer are torrent applications. For the most part the division on the web is complete and hosting a web server on your very powerful cable modem or DSL line would be grounds for termination of your access.<p>Servers are hosted centrally and are operated by companies whereas clients are simply terminals that access the content stored on those servers.<p>I hope that answers your question in enough detail, you could easily write a book about this.",1433783428

9680437,comment,9677863,9677863,0,0,earlz,,,"Although not nearly as horrific as a coal mine, I learned this type of lesson in a bout of unemployment. I&#x27;m a self-taught programmer, and had been laid off of my job, and with only 1 year of experience and no degree it&#x27;s super tough to get anything in a small town.<p>So, I ended up working at a local factory. The labor itself was hard, hot, and sweaty(in the summer, the temp was usually around 120F), but you got use to it after a month or two if you don&#x27;t have a heat stroke (which is common).. The most horrifying thing I saw in this though was the utter disregard for human life.<p>If you got hurt on the job for any reason, the company would try to find anyway they could to fire you as soon as possible. One guy had a family to feed and all, and due to a missing guard ended up grinding a spot on his arm down to the bone. Although the department head had told him to work as fast as possible and disregard the missing guard, it was the employees fault for getting hurt. He came in the next day bandaged up and on painkillers (because they still didn&#x27;t let him have a day off) and then fired him at around an hour before closing.<p>In another case, a guy in my department that I commonly ate with lost his finger. I didn&#x27;t hear the story of what exactly happened, but he was fired, determined to be his fault. Also, the factory tended to actually be a highly sought after job. It was well paid (for the area, around $13/hour) and accepted anyone with a high school diploma. So, if you complained about too much, you could easily find yourself canned for not meeting impossible quotas and with a replacement at your station in less than a week.<p>Also, people drove from all over (Oklahoma) to go to this job. So, when there was a rare snow storm and most people were trapped in their house, they all had to take &quot;points&quot; (ie, their only allocated time off) if they couldn&#x27;t leave. I think 5 or 6 people wrecked on the way to work.. They kept this crap up even after being sued for some relatively small amount by an ex-employee for being fired due to crashing on the way to work when there was an ice storm (She was fired because she ran out of her allocated time off)<p>The way the managers and company would treat humans more like robots was really more painful than the work, and when I quit (because I got a programming job again) I did not complete my 2 weeks I was suppose to and ensured that I&#x27;d never be able to work there again",1433782892

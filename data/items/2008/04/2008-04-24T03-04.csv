An excerpt from the same work by Roosevelt:<p>""Of course all that I say of the orator applies with even greater force to the orator's latter-day and more influential brother, the journalist. The power of the journalist is great, but he is entitled neither to respect nor admiration because of that power unless it is used aright. He can do, and he often does, great good. He can do, and he often does, infinite mischief. All journalists, all writers, for the very reason that they appreciate the vast possibilities of their profession, should bear testimony against those who deeply discredit it. Offences against taste and morals, which are bad enough in a private citizen, are infinitely worse if made into instruments for debauching the community through a newspaper. Mendacity, slander, sensationalism, inanity, vapid triviality, all are potent factors for the debauchery of the public mind and conscience. The excuse advanced for vicious writing, that the public demands it and that the demand must be supplied, can no more be admitted than if it were advanced by the purveyors of food who sell poisonous adulterations.""<p>It is nearly impossible to take MA seriously after he uses terms like ""Amatuer Hour at Twitter"" for one of the most influential technical individuals in our community right now. Blaine Cook is a Man in the Arena, MA is a slandering journalist. MA should apologize and hold the same standards to himself that he asks of his readers. That is, if he was ever serious at SS08, something which I must now question.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3745/tr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3745/tr.html</a>",1209006942

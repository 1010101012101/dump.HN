4739448,comment,4739152,4739152,3,0,biturd,,,"My opinion is that this guy is very illustrative of how screwed we are with regard to privacy, yet I'm having trouble deciding which side to be on, since I can't have it both ways.<p>If we could, for arguments sake, ignore the issue of different states having different laws on the audio aspect of recording. I believe the audio law I am referring to was designed to protect the public from being secretly recorded on the telephone. Unfortunately, it has been misappropriated with regards to changes in technology.<p>It is my understanding that you have the right to photograph/video ( again, gloss over audio issues for a moment ) anything you desire as long as you are on public property. You can even peer into private areas while being located on public property. This all comes down to what is referred to as a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"". Someone has already linked to explanations if these laws.<p>It's the very premise that allows the paparazzi to exist and be profitable at what they do. That and despite what the famous may say, it's a relationship that need exist or they would not be famous. If you are sitting inside an all glass Apple store and someone films you from outside, you had no expectation of privacy before you walked in, every passerby is seeing you with their own eyes just not recording it permanently.<p>I'm actually in support of this. I believe it's part of freedom of speech to be able to record or photograph things while in public.<p>Yet oddly, I'm very much against the rise in CCTV in every store I go into. I think perhaps this comes down to one key word for me. ""Surveillance"". I don't like automated surveillance becoming more and more commonplace. But a photographer or videographer is not performing such an act.<p>There's also part of me that feels all law enforcement should be recording everything all the time. For their protection as well as the publics.<p>I think the guy brings up some interesting points, as before thinking about this I was pro public ability to record, even into private spaces, asking as from a public location. But a CCTV is doing the same in many cases. I think most of you understand the internal debate in having with myself.<p>I think one interesting point is how the majority of people got immediately angry. Some felt they had a right to privacy while in public, for which they are wrong. And others, I believe mostly  ""security"" took it as far as assault and either touched, shoved, or pushed the guy with a few hitting his camera.<p>He may be more effective if just before he left, he handed them a small flyer that brings to their attention all these issues. It's nice to see people have an opinion about something, and they very clearly have strong and loud opinions as these videos show. But they are very quiet as another 100 cameras are installed in their local pumpkin patch.",1352026349

I can only imagine what they are like now, but in the late 90s, after we put up our new headquarters, that included a NOC (and therefor a 24x7 security station), we had the bubble cameras with really, really amazing zoom.  The security team, having absolutely nothing to do (this was sunnyvale on Mathilda Avenue, not really a hot bed of things to be worried about) - spent all of their time using the camera to intrude on people's privacy, in a very intimate manner.  They zoomed on apartments, they zoomed on cars, they zoomed on hotel windows.  They were able to count the change at the fast food restaurant across the road.  And this happened all without people ever being aware.<p>The difference with the cameraman, is he is letting people know what he is doing - there is no deception.  That's the entire point, people are under _incredible_ amounts of surveillance, without their permission.  Sometimes very intimate moments are being captured.<p>So - while it feels <i>extraordinarily</i> intrusive to deal with this guy, if it gets a conversation going around what's being captured, and recorded, without your knowledge - then I think some good can come of it.",1352026120

If he made the slightest change, i.e was holding a microphone, people would not only stop what they were doing and allow themselves to be recorded, but they'd let him ask them questions. I think there's enough evidence of this in other YouTube videos where one person calls a random person, puts on their best over zealous voice, tells them they're from a radio station and asks them embarrassing questions that the call-ey couldn't be happier to answer. As outlined in many books it's just a very basic principle of social engineering. People want to give their information out, it's just a matter of asking for it politely. If he had gone into one of those classes and asked to sit in and record it for 2 minutes, even without a purpose, I'm sure they would have been much more open to the idea. A surveillance camera is on the opposite side but the same in many ways, it's not asking anything from you and it's far enough away that people don't feel threatened by it. There is fault in both the creepy camera mans and the people he's recording's logic. The cameraman thinks that they have a problem being filmed at all, and the people think that they're less safe because they can see that they're being filmed. You can bring to their attention the fact that they're being filmed every day all you want but that doesn't change anything because it's so out of site and out of mind that they don't (and won't) see it as a threat.",1352025347

So yes, there are people controlling these cameras full time from these control rooms and they're actively monitoring everybody.<p>They also follow people with cameras like in the OP but the reaction is wildly different. People shockingly seem to be mostly OK with it.<p>Full documentary (in Dutch): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYTN1IMBuYU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYTN1IMBuYU</a> - See e.g. 31 minutes in.",1352024053

What's the evidence that the Earth cannot support a population of 10 billion with wealth equivalent to, say, the current US?<p>Today there are potential long-term problems in the way we use fresh water and hydrocarbons, but those are not fundamentally insoluble, far from it they are immanently tractable engineering problems. Consider that by the year 2100 the global economy will likely be over a quadrillion dollars in size (in 2012 dollars). And it will be filled with millions upon millions more engineers, entrepreneurs, technicians, and so forth than the world of today. I find it hard to believe that such a world will have trouble growing food or operating desalinization plants or adapting to using nuclear fission power, etc.<p>None of this requires massive social change or technological breakthroughs, it merely requires that people invest money and effort into engineering solutions to problems as those problems develop, which is something mankind has excelled at for millenia and will be extremely well prepared for in the 21st century.",1352023976

You seem to believe it is because the person doing the recording might attack or ask for money. I don't really buy this argument, since being asked for money is not really threatening, and there are so few people who turn violent randomly that it is not something one would assume immediately of strangers.<p>Most likely, the reason people become angry when recorded is due to a privacy concern since they do not know what the recorder will do with the video. In this case, I think this guy does make a valid point. There is no way to tell what will happen to surveillance camera footage. Yes, theoretically it should only be used in special circumstances, but until it is codified into law, and even if it is, there's really no guarantee.",1352023798

Taken across <i>N</i> cameras, no actual person needs to watch any single camera. You can be targeted directly if the watcher controls a subset of <i>N</i> that captures you.<p>There is little difference between the output of one man and one camera following you around all day, and the result of <i>N</i> cameras stitched together algorithmically and watched by one person. In fact the machine managed version would be far superior given the increased range of capture <i>N</i> cameras (not required to be held by a human) provide.<p>Yes, the guy is annoying and I am surprised nobody beat him up. But the guy is not the point of this experiment - the camera is. An alternative experiment design could be placing the camera on a tripod at ground level and standing aloof a few feet away. I think just bringing the cameras down to ground level from the ceiling could be a big enough jump into the zone of discomfort for most people.",1352023541

Since I pretty comprehensively disagree with that statement (impact to something as dynamic as the ecosystem can not be measure concretely, most people's metric of ""impact"" are incoherent when you really examine them, zero impact isn't a useful metric in light of these things, and I have at least as much ""right"" to exist and impact an environment as a beaver), I tend to agree with you.

Any physical device which does work produces heat as well (well eventually. The energy may feed into other processes before it ends up as heat). A 100% efficient device is one that produces work equal to the amount of heat (I think - my thermodynamics is a little rusty). A pure heater produces heat without doing any work whatsoever with the energy. \nThe most efficient heating would be done either by a heat pump (backwards air conditioner), or by doing some work with it.<p>Your point about heating only the rooms required is quite true, though. portable heaters may be more efficient than other extant kinds of heater. One other disadvantage is that many of them are air heaters, and the human body is more sensitive to radiant heat than air temperature.

While the media coverage of him may make it seem like he is the bane of the American government, they have much more important things to worry about.  This approach was perfected by the CIA during the cold war, but it has been a long time since someone in the public eye was important or dangerous enough to warrant an assassination.<p>The other problem I have with this is that rape is an awful way to frame someone.

1622889,comment,1622746,1622853,0,0,BobbyH,,,"A summary of Crossing the Chasm (a great book):<p>* All products are first adopted by Innovators, then Early Adopters, the Early Majority, the Late Majority, and finally Laggards. You may be an Early Adopter in one market (e.g. gadgets) but a Laggard in another (e.g. fashion).<p>* Disruptive products may do well with Innovators and Early Adopters, but the Early Majority is not willing to deal with a product that they don't understand (because it's not like another product they know).<p>* Happily, the Early Majority finds out about new products from the Early Adopters. So if you're building a disruptive product, you need to first make a critical mass of Early Adopters willing to recommend you to the Early Majority.<p>* To do this, he suggests that you make a ""whole product"" that addresses 100% of the needs of a particular niche (a ""bowling pin""). The users in that niche will endure the pains of early-adoption in order to have 100% of their needs met (versus a generalized product that only meets, say, 80% of your needs). You will thus get happy Early Adopters in one niche.<p>* Then, you add the features you need to create a whole product for the next niche. As you succeed in each niche, you are not only improving your product, but you are collecting customer references in each niche. Eventually, if you have great customer references in a lot of niches, you can ""cross the chasm"" faced by all disruptive products by having enough overall customer references that the Early Majority will hear about and try your product.<p>* So, using this approach gives you two advantages. First, you have explicitly considered a bunch of niches and added features to make your product satisfy customer needs deeply. Second, you have a critical mass of customer references to ""cross the chasm"" to the mass market.<p>Here is an illustration: <a href=""http://faculty.msb.edu/homak/homahelpsite/webhelp/Crossing_the_Chasm_-_Bowling_Alley.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.msb.edu/homak/homahelpsite/webhelp/Crossing_t...</a>",1282400306

That’s all.<p>Just take a moment and think about what would be necessary to frame someone. That doesn’t seem like a simple task to me. We are talking about Swedish police and prosecutors here, police and prosecutors who know that they would be in the spotlight and under intense scrutiny the moment they decided to prosecute Assange. Sweden is not exactly known for its corrupt police and prosecutors, taking that route seems like a stretch.<p>How do you get two completely normal women (and not any random women, women which have some, however torturous, connection to Assange) to lie to the police? They, too, must know that they would be under intense scrutiny the moment they talked to the police. Lying to the police is no joke, it’s a crime. It’s also a risk for the briber. Who’s to say that one of those women doesn’t break under the intense scrutiny and reveal the conspiracy? If there ever is a trial it will be public and intense stress for the two women. They will also be evaluated, probably several times, by a psychologist. Those two women are not professionally trained super agents.",1282399557

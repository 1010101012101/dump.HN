9269623,comment,9268946,9269256,0,0,krschultz,,,"I think it&#x27;s the same thing as intelligence (in the national security sense). You can do lots of things to prevent outsiders  from getting in, but if the insiders want to circumvent the protections, they can. Someone has to have &quot;root&quot; access, when you can&#x27;t trust that person, you are done.<p>About the only thing I could think of is some way for people to report a problem like this and air traffic controllers on the ground having a way to take over control of the plane from people inside the plane. But that too could have problems (what if the air traffic controller on the ground is the murderous one, and now he is crashing planes that the pilot can&#x27;t control).<p>I think it&#x27;s a near impossible problem to fully solve. The closest thing I can think of is positive train control (PTC) which sets safe boundaries and overrides the operator if the train exceeds those boundaries. In this case maybe the plane simply can not be flown into the airspace around the Alps no matter how much the pilot wants to.",1427378376

9269621,comment,9257818,9266430,0,0,mhurron,,,"My experience is people generally believe those in prison deserve to be in prison. That there are so many in prison because so many are breaking the law. That the US is a dangerous place and arrest indicates guilt.<p>These people also believe that crime ridden parts are crime ridden because they&#x27;re full of blacks and once a few black people move into an area they needed to add and change locks on their doors because B&E&#x27;s were going to go up to fuel their drug problem. That the prison population is majority black makes complete sense to them.<p>Is it possible that you are talking to people that already agree with you, or at lest people younger than say 40ish? Much of the above comes from people I would never choose to associate with, but through marriage and moving to a different part of the US I have been blessed with being able to listen to some absolute bullshit. Then I moved to a larger city, and heard less of it.<p>As pointed out above, one of the easiest ways to get votes for either party is to be tough on crime. One of the worst things you can do when running for office is to appear weak or lenient. These wouldn&#x27;t be such a great go-to tactic if the population in general thought they had a runaway problem in the prison system.",1427378350

9269610,comment,9268821,9269397,0,0,flohofwoe,,,"The author is Alon Zakai, creator of emscripten, and the article is quite old (2013) when there was a somewhat heated debate whether a byte code format would be better for the web instead of Javascript, with the byte code fans having fairly theoretical reasons (basically: &#x27;because it is the right way to do it and Javascript sucks anyway&#x27;), instead Alon went ahead and <i>demonstrated</i> that in reality the more pragmatic solution to compile to JS has no disadvantages compared to byte code, and you don&#x27;t need to add a whole new language engine to browsers (like Google PNaCl does), but (in the case of asm.js) only fairly minor modifications to existing JS engines, and you keep full compatibility (but lower performance) with old JS engines.<p>Interestingly, emscripten now also supports an interpreted byte code mode (called emterpreter), which stores code in a byte code format, and runs this inside an JS interpreter(!). The reason for this was quicker startup time for large scripts, but (my own speculation!) it might also be a path to a future byte code distribution format if there are indeed any other practical advantages.<p>Another interesting point is that Safari actually has now an LLVM based compilation layer in their Javascript engine, so it&#x27;s coming together from both sides with LLVM being the glue (emscripten&#x27;s front end is also LLVM).",1427378272

We work hard to get research from the lab out into industry where it can have the broadest application and best chance for making an impact.  For biological and pharmaceutical technologies, it can take quite some time to make this transition, and there is often a lot of risk that techniques which work well in the lab may fail when scaled or otherwise adapted for industry.  Clinical trials take a lot of time and money, and the FDA review process is stringent.  Those are all risks shouldered by our commercial partners whether they be start-ups or large multi-nationals.  For our part, we need to make sure that they have the protection they need to carry those risks over a span of years until a product can make it to market.  That protection starts as soon as we first file a provisional patent for a technology and continues through the patent lifecycle (continuations, divisionals, international phase, etc).  There is a large cost to this from a university perspective, and we are provided with the budget to handle that (federal funds are not used to cover the patent costs).<p>We are also very selective in how we license these technologies.  The split is generally between exclusive and non-exclusive licensing, and we try to make the best call given the particular technology we&#x27;re dealing with.  In many cases, the technology is quite specific and there may only be a handful of companies in need of it.  In many other scenarios we recognize the potentially broad application of the technology and work out ways to license it non-exclusively.  There are also times when corporate partners aren&#x27;t ready to bite due to the lack of maturity of the innovation.  In those cases, we can help spin off startups to continue the development of the technology until it has reached a stage where it is more attractive to investors.<p>One of the most important parts of this whole process is the royalty side of things. Since we are able to protect the IP and license it responsibly, our office generates a large amount of revenue.  That money goes back to the university in a somewhat-complex system of distributions where the inventor&#x27;s department and lab get a cut to help continue their research.  Importantly, the inventors themselves also get direct payouts from the licensing revenue.  I think we can all agree that if we were unable to patent and license their inventions, then they would not be able to share in the success of their efforts.<p>* Full disclosure: We have licensed IP to the company mentioned in this article",1427377571

9269458,comment,9268946,9269110,0,0,mikeash,,,"Technically I believe the autopilot is a higher level in the system, and the anti-stall stuff (among others) is part of the lower-level fly-by-wire system. It&#x27;s sort of like with a car and the difference between anti-lock brakes (fly-by-wire), cruise control (basic autopilot functionality), and autonomous steering to reach a certain location (advanced autopilot functionality).<p>In any case, you&#x27;re right that the automation (by whatever name) can already override the pilot in many cases. But it&#x27;s a really tricky problem because you can easily make things worse instead of better. For example, one reason that Air France 447 crashed was that one of the pilots was commanding the airplane as if it were in a fly-by-wire mode it was not actually in. The plane had already stalled, but he was flying it as if the computers would prevent him from stalling, rather than taking proper corrective action. A proper recovery maneuver would have saved it. This is ultimately pilot error, but automation is a strong contributing factor. For another example, Asiana 214 crashed because the pilot assumed the airplane was doing more for him than it really was, trusting the automation to keep his speed steady, which it wasn&#x27;t set to do. Again, pilot error, but with automation as a contributing factor.<p>It seems likely that automation is a net gain when done right, but it requires careful consideration.",1427377268

Further, it was pointed out that while American companies could be forced to use the Clipper chip in their encryption products, foreign companies could not, and presumably phones with strong data encryption would be manufactured abroad and spread throughout the world and into the United States, negating the point of the whole exercise, and, of course, materially damaging U.S. manufacturers en route.

Both of those assertions are flat wrong.<p>Again, modules in ES6 started before Dart (&quot;Dash&quot;) leaked.<p>Your original comment said &quot;Thank you Dart for showing us the way.&quot; Happy-clappy nonsense!<p>Why am I on the warpath?<p>First, sloppy history retelling -- even if just fannish exaggeration -- is bad in itself.<p>Second, and I&#x27;ve gone on the record about this since 2011, Google chose the wrong &quot;REPLACE JS BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE FIXED&quot; strategy, and wasted years and megabucks. Their choice, but not something to congratulate them over. We could have had even more in ES6 if the V8 team had not been reset and JS back-benched as it was. That cost years.<p>Third, the meme you&#x27;re spreading is that JS is incompetent or severely hobbled without being shown the way by enlightened others. This does a disservice to many people including the V8 team (the new team) members working in earnest on JS via implementations and TC39. It&#x27;s a particular falsehood to which I object as a peer of those people on TC39.<p>Dart as an intentionally designed, full-time-job-for-60+-people, good and well-done project at Google, creating useful and coherent tools as well as the language itself? A fine thing in isolation, ignoring the actual history, global strategy, and consequent trade-offs.<p>Dart as the thing that showed JS the way (same for CoffeeScript, but let&#x27;s defer that and focus on Dart)? A fraudulent claim that covers up real mistakes in strategy made by Google, which cost big time and money, not just for JS and the Web, but bad also (in light of this week&#x27;s news) for Dart.<p>Why was the strategy bad for Dart? One example: only now, finally, might bignums get into ES7/2016. They could have been in ES6 and in V8 and other engines by now, since we were working on them since 2010, but without a champion who saw the priority and paid someone to spec and implement them in V8.<p>Do you see my point? Please do not play games about me &quot;admitting&quot; SIMD and maybe one other something else came from Dart.

E.g., out of 1000 samples, my desktop in the Netherlands (via XS4All) sees low latencies from Route 53 ~60% of the time:<p><pre><code>  $ seq 1 1000 | xargs -n 1 sh -c &#x27;dig test-$0.trosc.com | grep &quot;Query time&quot; | awk &quot;{print \$4}&quot;&#x27; | histogram.py -f &quot;%3d&quot;\n\n   18 -  59 [   609]: ∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎\n   59 - 100 [     1]: \n  100 - 141 [     1]: \n  141 - 182 [   229]: ∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎\n  182 - 224 [   102]: ∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎∎\n  224 - 265 [    37]: ∎∎∎∎\n  265 - 306 [     1]: \n  306 - 347 [    15]: ∎\n  347 - 388 [     2]: \n  388 - 430 [     2]:\n</code></pre>\nThis looks decent at the median (20ms), but falls off beyond with 185ms at the 90th percentile and 88ms average, with one >1s outlier removed.<p>As you pointed out, Route 53 optimizes for availability and DDoS resilience over RTT performance. There are 4 name server IPs to choose from which gives me 4 different paths to 4 different server locations via anycast, giving me 4 different RTT buckets. Few DNS providers go through such lengths for availability. Still, 185ms is a lot. It&#x27;s probably because anycast/BGP advertisements from the US get to AMS-IX with a smaller number of hops than competing advertisements from European locations. I would guess Route 53&#x27;s current striping is not heavily tuned for RTTs.<p>Caching solves part of this, but there are a lot of resolvers out there. As a thought example: Assume your sources of traffic are uniformly distributed among 75000 resolvers and you use 60 second TTLs (pretty standard), then you won&#x27;t see significant benefit from caching until you get to >>1000 requests/s.<p>Many applications also have a long-tail of DNS names and basically wont benefit from caching at all. This could  be motivated by availability as well (think shuffle sharding :). I&#x27;m building one where DNS query time currently dominates page load time (especially aliasing to CloudFront can be slow :). It&#x27;s useful to understand that there&#x27;s a general availability vs. latency trade-off in DNS that only gets partially addressed by the resolver.",1427376256

You go to a level of secondary school at age 12, based on a test at age 11.<p>I personally got a maximum score of 550/550 on this test which gets you into &#x27;gymnasium&#x27;. If you get below 545 you go to a middle-level education (will let you go to university of applied sciences, to become e.g. a marketing manager, teacher, physical therapist etc). Below 530 you do to the lower-level education (for lack of a better word), to train to become e.g. hairdresser or cook.<p>Anyway I got 550 but still went to middle-level as per a teachers&#x27; recommendation. (typical minimal effort maximum score kid). Later ended up still going to uni but it&#x27;s a path with various hurdles and detours.<p>Frustrating in hindsight that this decision happens so early in life when you don&#x27;t quite grasp the implications of educational & class differences, and at an age where the notion of becoming someone who volunteers in an animal shelter is way more interesting than to become a data scientist. As you grow up you realize the social stratification brought about by educational differences.<p>And then on top, indeed, you choose a certain flavor of high school. You get 2 years of general purpose stuff. Everyone gets both Physics and Math, as well as French and Art History, etc. But then the 3-4 years after, you choose one or the other. That&#x27;s at age 14ish. And so even if you do gymnasium and everyone can go to uni, you&#x27;re not going to be able to apply for medicine for example if you didn&#x27;t do 6 years of physics in secondary school.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of talk to change it. In fact I think Finland just removed the concept of &#x27;subjects&#x27; altogether. Which is a radical thing to do, and takes a lot of effort and rethinking and reshaping of education. But it could be brilliant. Here they&#x27;re talking about making secondary school a bit more general purpose, as the huge push for &#x27;career planning&#x27; sessions for 12 and 16 year olds isn&#x27;t enough to let them make informed decisions about what they&#x27;ll be studying at age 20, and working in at age 30 or 40. Beyond that all of education is shifting away from skills, and towards competencies. So that if you teach &#x27;self-learning&#x27;, someone who spent 5 years in marketing can shift to become a programmer, if the economy changes. At least that&#x27;s the general idea. It&#x27;s a lot harder but competencies are definitely more valuable and important than skills (which become redundant as tech changes, e.g. being a skilled typewriter) in the long-term.",1427376128

If 25% of the population experiences a mental health issue at some point in their life or whatever ridiculously high percentage, then given the huge fraction of the population flying with issues, issues obviously almost never cause a problem, its right up there with meteor strikes.  So you end up with false positive/negative issues.  If you assume all men have been dumped by a girlfriend at least once that means roughly 3e9 false positive if you assume all dumped dudes are going to mass murder an entire airplane, a false positive rate of eight nines I think?  That idea would be up there with banning German pilots, after all one of them apparently did kill a lot of people and the false postive rate is staggeringly lower than banning all people with mere claustrophobia or a bad attitude or whatever.",1427375426

You can do that until the cows come home, but unless you can offer actual refutations of the arguments I presented in support of those claims, you are just blowing hot air.<p>&#x27;Sure you could do it that way. But it becomes exponentially more complicated because you need to either stick to one specific implementation of one specific language runtime, or you have to deal with explaining them all.&#x27;<p>Now we come to something that has the verisimilitude of a rational argument, and we can immediately see why you were reluctant to go there, despite the manifest failings of the alternatives you tried. The first question that comes to mind is, exponential in what? What, precisely, leads to an exponential growth in complexity? Note that the sentence quoted here claims exponentially more complication even if you stick to one specific implementation of one specific language runtime, so make sure that your explanation covers that case, or I will have to return to it. Also make sure that your explanation somehow avoids applying to C++, and covers how we ever managed to figure this all out before we had C++.<p>Furthermore, the implication that it has to be presented using one extant runtime or another is fallacious. One can discuss argument passing using stack frames and addresses without getting into how C++ or any other specific language implements it, and the empirical proof of that can be found in any number of elementary comp. sci. textbooks.<p>Your &#x27;its so simple&#x27; argument is a non-sequitur, as you are making the fallacy that if the concept is simple, then any explanation will be simple. In reality people can, and do, tie themselves in knots over simple issues - Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes are a case in point. In fact, the simplicity argument goes against you - it&#x27;s so simple, yet you ended up retroactively qualifying your use of pointer as &#x27;abstract pointer&#x27; and spend time in drawing analogies between C++ pointers and Java references.<p>And if its so simple, how come that there are people who are just not getting it? Maybe, just maybe, the problem is in how it is presented.<p>The question of whether an approach via C++ is helpful, and whether your particular approach (using qualified analogies between C++ and Java) helps, are separate issues. I could go into how well your approach worked in practice, though I don&#x27;t think that is necessary at this point (unless you choose to go there), except to point out that you repeatedly abandoned this approach in favor of a purely Java one, telling people to &#x27;read the JLS.&#x27;",1427374840

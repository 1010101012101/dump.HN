>If you say something that doesn't make sense, you're saying that one shouldn't have to back that up?</i><p>Read what you quoted from me, and what you ask. Where do I say that people should not back up things they say that ""don't make sense""?<p>Where do I even say they do not have to ""back up"" the things they say? I merely say that they do not have to PROVE everything. You can back stuff up with some arguments and counterargurments, you don't need to provide some ""proof"".<p>><i>I think the reason pat_punnu is balking at what you have said is because of this: You can think of C as a serialized form of an AST. In order for parsing to produce a non-equivalent AST to the one used to serialize it, the C grammar must be non-deterministic. The C grammar is not non-deterministic, therefore what you said does not make sense and pat_punnu (somewhat rudely) asked you to back up what you were saying.</i><p>And the reason I'm balking at this is that you examine the case AFTER C has been generated. I'm not talking about that stage (when reading back C to generate an AST). I (and pat_punnu) and talking at the previous stage of spitting out the C code to disk in the first place. I'm saying that a structured way to do that (LLVM API) is safer than merely creating strings yourself.<p>So your: ""It is in fact the equivalent of asking you to prove that an XML parser after serializing a DOM tree and then parsing that same document produces a non-equivalent DOM tree to the original""<p>takes this from several steps ahead.

5659304,comment,5658469,5659189,1,0,bmelton,,,"In breaking down my posts to bullet points and responding paratactically, I don't really have any way to rebut.  If your goal is to win the argument, then kudos, you're doing well.  If it's to understand 'the other side' of the argument, then you're failing miserably.<p>1d) what is a ""fix,"" then, and what distinguishes them?
I don't know.  I didn't claim to have a fix.<p>1e) what wouldn't be a ""waste of citizen tax dollars,"" then, and what distinguishes them?
Well, there's the list of responsibilities enumerated to the federal government that they are obligated to perform.  It's arguable whether those things are a waste of tax dollars, but the federal government is obligated to perform than either way.  That would include interstates, highways, the postal service, etc.  Further, another federal government job is to protect against the abuse of individual freedoms by the state, so clearly the Supreme Court isn't a waste of tax dollars.<p>Regarding 2, I wasn't aware of the author's Scottish heritage, but certainly I didn't mean any bigotry, however much you might wish to impart that upon me.<p>3c-d The only tests that I can think of that would validate this would be if Medicare had more overhead than the US private insurance system (VERIFIABLY FALSE), or if foreign systems with socialized health care were in any case more expensive than ones without (VERIFIABLY FALSE.)<p>There are other tests, like how efficiently the VA performs in caring for its patients, and whether or not the quality of that care is good or efficiently administered.  You could also look to the many other programs that the federal government controls.  USPS, Fanny Mae, FEMA, etc.<p>I think the part that you're overlooking in your response is that I haven't asserted that the Affordable Health Care Act is bad.  I'm just saying that ignoring the many, many arguments in critique against it requires willful blindness.  The author wasn't able to find ""one good reason"" why ""anybody"" would oppose the act, after having performed ""thorough"" research into ""both sides"" of the argument.  I find that nearly impossible to believe.<p>There are things that I staunchly support, and admittedly, I have seen many red-herring arguments against them, but effectively what the author is suggesting is just.. nonsense.  If she were talking about a programming language, instead of the Affordable Health Care Act, maybe it would be more relatable to dev and engineering types, but just as though I can see valid reasons why my preferred development stack is not the best in the world ever, I wish the author was able to see past her own bias.  It seems she isn't able to.<p>Oh, and since I didn't respond to your points on 3, it's widely understood that the federal government is an adversarial process, with checks and balances.  It isn't meant to operate quickly, or even efficiently.  The process is meant to ensure that the actions of the men in elected office are always subject to oversight, which should help mitigate its ability for abuse.  It's meant to ensure that no single branch of the government has more power than the others, so that we can't enter into a dictatorial regime.  It's meant to ensure that a lot of really thorough discussion occurs on a bill before it can be enacted, and that both representatives and senators can get signoff to most accurately reflect the interests of its people.<p>Federal agencies, as an extension of the federal government, seldom run very efficiently.  Having consulted for many of them, I have a unique insight into how they <i>actually</i> run and operate, and above and beyond the average 'big company' bureaucracy, there are additional levels of red tape that simply prevent them from running lean, or agile, or any way in which might vaguely resemble such a concept.",1367779739

5659275,comment,5656153,5658323,1,0,burntsushi,,,"Respectfully, I think your analysis is overly simplistic. You ignored the elephant in the room: the geography of the US.<p>Cycling makes a <i>ton</i> of sense if you live in and around an urban area---particularly when most of your interactions with other people are in that same small area. Despite my love for driving, if I fit that mold, I'd happily adopt cycling as my main mode of transportation. But there are a couple of very common scenarios in the US that maybe aren't so common in other countries:<p>* Living in a suburb/rural area that is more than a half-hour drive from your place of work (in no traffic). There's a high price to pay in terms of <i>time</i> that cycling would entail.<p>* Traveling throughout the US. And I don't just mean across the country where trains or buses are appropriate---I mean visiting your friend several towns over. For instance, my friend that I frequently visit is about 30 minutes away by car but is about 100 minutes away by bicycle (back-roads, no traffic, data from Google Maps). Similarly for my parents.<p>I think both of these scenarios strongly militate toward owning a car in favor of a bicycle. I also think tons of people in the US fit this mold---certainly more so than smaller countries with a much denser overall population. Most of the people in the US live in cities---<i>but</i> the overall population density of the US is much lower than most other countries, which suggests that even if you live in or around a city, you have a much higher chance of having connections with people who live in more suburban or rural areas (than similar folks in denser countries). When that happens, a car is typically the most sensible form of transportation.<p>Of course, it's certainly plausible that we could own cars that we rarely use but cycle to work every day, for example. But I think that's a more complex dynamic and I don't think I have the tools to properly analyze it.<p>I also find your enthusiasm for passing laws to legislate your cost/benefit analysis on everyone else to be deeply disturbing, but I'll leave that one be.",1367779308

This also goes for scientific ideas with political implications, such as global warming (which i'll not discuss here).<p>I am not claiming that they're ""wrong"" in doing this - people clearly have a right to promote what they believe in - just that I think the many of the ideas themselves are wrong, and damaging to the economy overall but also the middle class.  though that is a different and much longer conversation.<p>Topics  include:<p>Support for ""expansionary austerity"" - ie. if governments spend less the economy will recover because of ""confidence"".<p>Debt and Growth (2013)

So I'd recommend paying a closer attention to the USSR history and being a bit critical to the ""we overspent them"" or ""they did not do socialism right, duh"" explanations. In my opinion, if it's been possible to overspend a superpower that had its own spaceships then overspending small fry like Libya, North Korea or Iran would not take any time at all. And free market just does not work when people have their basic needs covered. 
There also had been very small free market in the USSR and it was so small not because communists had been screwing with it (at least not more than the western governments screw with their markets), it's been small because most people just ignored it.

If I put a hundred metronomes on the floor and set them ticking, they'll each do their own thing, swinging at their own rhythm. In this condition, they're not yet coupled. Because the floor is rigid, the metronomes can't feel each other's vibrations, at least not enough to make a difference. But now place them all on a movable platform like the seat of a child's swing. The metronomes will start to feel each other's jiggling. The swing will start to sway, imperceptibly at first, but enough to disturb each metronome and alter its rhythm. Eventually the whole system will synchronize, with all the metronomes ticking in unison. By allowing the metronomes to impose themselves on each other through the vibrations they impart to the movable platform, we have coupled the system and changed its dynamics radically.<p>""In all sorts of complex systems, this is the general trend: increasing the coupling between the parts seems harmless enough at first. But then, abruptly, when the coupling crosses a critical value, everything changes. The exact nature of the altered state isn't easy to foretell. It depends on the system's details. But it's always something qualitatively different from what came before. Sometimes desirable, sometimes deadly.<p>""I worry that we're playing the coupling game with ourselves, collectively. With our cell phones and GPS trackers and social media, with globalization, with the coming Internet of things, we're becoming more tightly connected than ever. Of course, maybe that's good. Greater coupling means faster and easier communication and sharing. We can often do more together than apart.<p>""But the math suggests that increasing coupling is a siren's song. Too much makes a complex system brittle. In economics and business, the wisdom of the crowd works only if the individuals within it are independent, or nearly so. Loosely coupled crowds are the only wise ones.<p>""The human brain is the most exquisitely coupled system we know of, but the coupling between different brain areas has been honed by evolution to allow for the subtleties of attention, memory, perception, and consciousness. Too much coupling produces pathological synchrony: the rhythmic convulsions and loss of consciousness associated with epileptic seizures.<p>""Propagating malware, worldwide pandemics, flash crashesall symptoms of too much coupling. Unfortunately it's hard to predict how much coupling is too much. We only know that we want more, and that more is better until it isn't.""",1367777769

The UK brand of welfare requires you to give up your dignity by completing endless forms and checks in the hope that - if your particular brand of requirements fit the definitions laid out by the state - you'll be allowed to live an all-to-often hopeless and impoverished quality of life. Day-to-day you're worrying about food and rent; there's no money for recreation, no money to clothe your children in a respectable way and no money to go on holiday like all your workmates and childrens' friends. You're trapped in your house and there's no opportunity to learn and to retrain in order to make a new life for yourself. Those that do get out of the spiral are those that have super-human resilience and determination over a number of years.
The difference a basic income could make to the UK could be enormous. It would change this country over night. It doesn't even matter if a few percent of people abuse it - it is far outweighed by opportunities it will give to those who wish to turn their lives around.",1367777501

5659166,comment,5659106,5659122,3,0,thirsteh,,,"> If you hash passwords on the client, you aren't doing hashing right! If you hash passwords on the client, all an attacker needs is a user's hash, and then he can send it to you and get logged in without ever knowing the user's password.<p>It doesn't matter if the server gets a password or a digest, as long as it can verify it. Hashing on the client side is obviously superior to hashing on the server side, since the original password is never transmitted over the wire. It is for the same reason protocols like SRP exist. (If you're worried about somebody compromising your digest database and logging in with those digests, you can just hash them with a cheap function like SHA-256 on the server side. There is no reason for the server to use an expensive function since the client has already stretched the input.)<p>Unfortunately, SRP doesn't do key stretching, so it is trivial to brute-force the original input if you get a hold of the verifiers. But there'd be nothing wrong with e.g. a client-side scrypt mechanism that uses TLS for the transport, or even SRP/TLS-SRP (although you would need your server to manage/sync the salt.) It just hasn't been feasible so far since no efficient implementations have been available to web applications.<p>What you should take away from password hashing is that it exists primarily to protect users from themselves. If everyone used unique passwords with 256 bits of entropy for everything, we wouldn't need it. We need it because they use weak passwords, and they use the same ones in many different places. If your server gets owned, it likely doesn't matter whether they can log in with contents of the database or not--they're already inside, and can probably easily find another way. What matters is that by making it expensive to brute-force the original input of possibly thousands of your users' passwords, you make it very hard/cost-ineffective (if you do it properly) for an attacker to compromise many/all of their other online accounts.<p>PS: Digest auth as it exists today is a joke. It uses no stretching whatsoever, and is thus trivial to brute-force, whether by a MITM or an attacker who has gained access to the server's digest database.",1367777265

That I think almost everybody would agree with.<p>So then the question evolves into whether or not the Affordable Care Act actually meets that measure.  We do not currently know, and only time will ultimately tell, but again, there are many very obvious arguments suggesting that it won't actually deliver affordable health care, or that even if it does, that cost is masked by all the other costs.<p>If, in an extremely hypothetical example, Americans went from paying 35% in income taxes in general to paying 75% in income taxes, but all health care were free, then it might have succeeded in making health care affordable, but at the expense of making <i>everything else</i> you might want to spend money on more expensive.<p>Anyway, just food for thought.

6617584,comment,6617489,6617489,3,0,ollysb,,,"One of the things I&#x27;m really excited about with self-driving is that it will tilt the economics towards car pools rather than car ownership.<p>Currently everyone has to buy cars that will be suitable for any journey they might have to make. This means that people commute to work in cars that can take a whole family on holiday. Self-driving would mean you could always get the most suitable car for the journey you&#x27;re about to make. Perhaps you&#x27;re feeling tired and want to sleep on the way to work? Maybe you want to do some work so you&#x27;d like a desk? Put your feet up in an entertainment centre?<p>Self-driving will become popular because it will mean the end of wasting hours of your life watching the car in front of you. Just think of the ads, what could you do with an extra 3 hours a day?",1382799538

Governments never change.<p><i>It was Juvenal that coined this system, a mechanism of influential power over the Roman mass. &quot;Panem et Circensus&quot;, literally &quot;bread and circuses&quot;, was the formula for the well-being of the population, and thus a political strategy. This formula offered a variety of pleasures such as: the distribution of food, public baths, gladiators, exotic animals, chariot races, sports competition, and theater representation. It was an efficient instrument in the hands of the Emperors to keep the population peaceful, and at the same time giving them the opportunity to voice themselves in these places of performance.</i> [0]<p>[0]:<a href=""http://www.capitolium.org/eng/imperatori/circenses.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capitolium.org/eng/imperatori/circenses.htm</a>",1382799461

A lighter kilo makes the dieter have a greater mass when measured in kilograms.<p>> Besides, can&#x27;t they recreate a &quot;canonical kilo&quot; with the required measurements?<p>This is the main point of the drive to redefine the kilogram. Right now, the IPK (the French kilogram) is <i>the</i> SI standard for the kilogram. Groups are working hard to redefine the kilo in terms of either Planck&#x27;s constant or the Avogadro number. In order to do so, the experiments that measure one of those fundamental constants must be more reliable than the IPK.<p>They&#x27;re very close, but absolute mass measurements of the required precision at the kilogram scale have never been done before.",1382799408

He is a strange man, who arrives one October evening in Digne, searches a place to stay for the night and is turned away. At last, he is taken in by the bishop, who trusts him, feeds him supper, and gives him a bed for the night. Hugo then details Valjean&#x27;s background. He was born sometime in 1769 in a small town and orphaned as a child. He became a pruner and helped support his widowed sister and her seven children. In winter 1795, when resources were scarce, Valjean stole a loaf of bread from a local baker. He was caught and imprisoned for five years in the Bagne of Toulon, the Toulon prison. He attempted to escape four times, and each time his sentence was lengthened by three years; he also received an extra two years for once resisting recapture during his second escape. After nineteen years in prison, he was released, but by law must carry a yellow passport that announces he is an ex-convict.<p>During the night, he awakens and steals the bishop&#x27;s silverware and silver plates, and runs off. He is arrested and brought back to the bishop. However, the Bishop admonishes Valjean (in front of the police) for forgetting to also take the silver candlesticks that he&#x27;d given Valjean, reminding Valjean of his &quot;promise&quot; to use the silver to become an honest man, claiming to have bought Valjean&#x27;s soul with it, withdrawing it from evil and giving it to God.</i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valjean#Jean_Valjean_in_the_novel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valjean#Jean_Valjean_in_t...</a>",1382797234

1879171,comment,1878829,1878829,0,0,nl,,,"As someone who spent 5 years working for an agency that was supposed to connect educators with technology, I feel quite qualified to say:<p><i>HA HA HA HA!</i><p>I read quotes like:<p><i>In a bow to the “Edupunks,” Sullivan explained that Virginia is incorporating student habits into its pedagogy. For example, the university is experimenting with “flash seminars.” Just as “flash mobs” summon young people to engage in some simultaneous bizarre act in a specified place at a specified time, the “flash seminars” alert students to an edgy topic -- no examples of how edgy -- that will be discussed in a professor's living room. To raise the hype level, only the first 25 students who show up are allowed to participate in this non-credit-bearing activity.</i><p>and I think of the endless papers I've seen on how <i>social networking/ipads/location based services/mobile computing/cloud computing/whatever was hot in the tech sphere six months ago</i> is going to revolutionize education. I'm continually reminded of cargo cults (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult</a>: <i>A cargo cult is a religious practice that has appeared in many traditional tribal societies in the wake of interaction with technologically advanced cultures.</i>)<p>Education systems have huge budgets, but they are always run by such second rate people that the money is never used as a lever to get what they need. Education systems are quite happy to spend millions of dollars on consultancies and studies, but because the focus is on risk avoidance they never actually achieve anything.<p>(And yes, there are a few exceptions. Having destroyed myself trying to achieve anything in that sector I applaud all the more for those who have managed it.)<p>For anyone considering doing a company in this space, read all the warnings you hear about doing enterprise software, and then take away the fact the most enterprises are at least rational (if slow). Then also remove the fact that enterprises pay people well, so they are usually a few decent people who you can deal with. Then add in politics, the election cycle, unions, teachers, lectures, ""duty of care"" considerations. If you are still considering that sector, then good luck!!",1289130357

Also I imagine that this is such an obvious thing, it wasn't a case of being unaware of the issue, just taking a conscious risk-reward decision on being SSL-only.

While I thought the parody was hilarious, the ""serious"" followup, in Sokal and Bricmont's book, is not that great. It mostly boils down to: some random critical theorists make too much use of crappy or stretched mathematical/scientific metaphors. That point was demonstrated much more penetratingly in the parody.<p>The book, though, feels like a literary scholar-pedant finding a metaphorical reference to Faust in a physics paper and launching into a longwinded critique about how the physicist has clearly misunderstood Faust. Well, maybe, and if that were common it'd be an annoying writing style, but errors in interpretation of Faust aren't really the point if it's a physics paper!<p>And to make matters worse, they don't even go after most of the big names--- there are no chapters in the book on Derrida, Foucault, Althusser, Barthes, etc., because they couldn't find any material to critique.",1289128626

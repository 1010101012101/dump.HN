I think someone I know somehow ends up involved with one of these plans every couple of years, and that's held constant for at least 10 or 12 years, with universally half-arsed execution. They all end up building the bit Jamie proposes (easily sharable group calendars with email/IM/website integration), but _nobody_ ever implements the ""Managers"" half of what Exchange does, because nobody writing open source software has that itch to scratch.<p>It's not 100% cast iron guaranteed, but the observation that ""enterprise software"" gets written by people on salaries in cubicles, and ""open source software"" gets written by people who don't have to wear suits to work - is so overwhelmingly often correct that we can use any of the very few counterexamples as ""the exceptions that prove the rule"".<p>Note too, that ""founding teams"" are not ""typical open source developers"", I think a small startup with a great plan and some enthusiastic early-adopter corporate customers is most probably who'll take down the MS Exchange market monopoly...

2261083,comment,2260863,2260950,0,0,alextgordon,,,"My 4am thoughts on the matter...<p>If a site has N copies associated with it, then you could compare that to the average number of copies associated with sites of that pagerank. If the difference between N and the average is high, then that's a likely spam site. Let's call this difference Ïƒ.<p>This gives us a problem though, because while Ïƒ is a good indicator of spamminess, it's not foolproof. A low pagerank site could have been copied from lots of times, which would unfairly earn it a high Ïƒ.<p>What we can do is calculate a Ïƒ', by inversely weighing each copy with the Ïƒ of the site on the other end. A copy of a site with a low sigma will increase Ïƒ', and a copy of a site with a high sigma will have less of an effect on Ïƒ'.<p>So while our high Ïƒ may have initially suggested the site to be spammy, all its copies are from high Ïƒ sites, which are counted less towards Ïƒ', leading to an overall verdict of <i>not spammy</i>. [I wonder what would happen if you iterated this process]<p>As for your example, the smaller site wouldn't be penalized, because N would be low. If it were say, a full wikipedia mirror, then it would be penalized. Wikipedia would not be penalized, since it has an ungodly amount of pagerank. There's also no bias against smaller sites, since Ïƒ is calculated relative to pagerank.<p>What have I missed?",1298608467

Or something to that effect.  A couple of weeks later, the owner emailed us, basically screaming ""why did you post such nasty things about me?""  Turns out someone from airbnb had put ""the owner pulled back from the agreement at the last minute"" onto the owners feedback page, with neither our permission nor any context (like, the power went out because of the snowstorm).

You'd expect 3rd world countries to still be smoking.<p>And yes, I concede, it does bring people together. But drinking is a far better way to do that.<p>I don't have a stick up my ass because I absolutely hate the feeling of choking in disgusting smelly smoke.<p>Again - I don't dislike it for some wooly reason like I think it's ""bad"". I dislike it because it tastes horrible. It smells absolutely disgusting. It makes your clothes smell. Your kids cough. Choking isn't fun. (And this is just second hand smoke. I've never smoked personally).",1262166498

As did both of my sisters, brother and everyone else in the school orchestra. One wouldn't learn it outside of music lessons or a music program. However, it's taught pretty early on if you're doing anything related to classical music.",1262166284

1022228,comment,1022014,1022014,0,0,waterlesscloud,,,"Excellent article.  The current Zynga model is certainly unsustainable.  They've hired Brian Reynolds, which hints at deeper games to come, but what they're doing right now will be ineffective in 6 months.<p>One thing I've been coming to terms with- just because something makes no sense long term doesn't mean that it's not a valuable course to pursue short term.<p>If, and it's a big if, Zynga can reinvent itself in the next 6-9 months, then this initial phase was brilliant in that it gave them the resources they needed to move on to real domination.  If they don't reinvent themselves, a few people will have made a lot of money, but nothing permanent will have been built.  A real opportunity will have been missed.<p>But they can't keep on the same path, it just won't work a lot longer.",1262166096

Is it <i>every</i> primary school?<p>For information/reference, it wasn't taught to me, or my sister, or my nieces, or my wife, or any of my colleagues at work.  I've checked.  Or at least, to be more accurate, none of them knew of it when I mentioned it to them recently.  Perhaps it was taught - it certainly didn't stick.",1262165205
1022220,comment,1020845,1020845,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"It's my experience that smart people are eager to share whenever the situation isn't detrimental to them.  They know the difference between zero sum and non-zero sum outcomes and behave accordingly.  They are happy to share when they have reason to believe it is to their advantage and they're just as quick to avoid fools and scammers.<p>Perhaps when Mr. Setty encounters smart people unwilling to share with him, he should take the opportunity to work on his own packaging skills.  I think he may learn that it's rarely easy to make things easy (even for a smart person).",1262165116
1022219,comment,1021772,1022032,0,0,btilly,,,"My complaint about people who get fake degrees is that they are liars and cheats, and if they are willing to lie and cheat about one thing then they are willing to lie and cheat about other things and I don't want them around.<p>My opinion on diploma mills is that they make it easier for liars and cheats to be more effective liars and cheats, so clamping down on them reduces the amount of lying and cheating in our society and that is a Good Thing.<p>My opinion on university degrees is that they have a slight correlation with brains but are not very good predictors.  Some of the best people in IT that I've ever worked with never finished college.  Including the programmer who mentored me at my start.  (He never graduated because he was so good at his summer internship that they gave him a job offer he couldn't turn down.)  I would therefore be delighted to hire the right non-college graduate.  But not if they were the kind of person who thinks it OK to lie and cheat their way past the issue of not having a degree.<p>I have a feeling that the two of us won't agree on much.  And the key difference is that you think that lying and cheating are OK while I don't.",1262164951

There's no reason that I should have to wait.<p>The edges are fine imo, they add a bit of challenge. Otherwise it would just be possible to randomly press awsd without looking much.<p>Also, I enjoy the shopping. It's fun to think about different play styles and shotgun vs blasters.<p>One thing is that I just ended up using mostly just blasters. Without being able to switch between 4 shotguns and 4 blasters quickly, it made more sense just to stick with blasters.<p>Fun game!",1262164181

Thankfully a lot of folks recognize that (the makers of the sony reader, amazon kindle, bn nook, etc. and their customers). A piece of software, no matter how well crafted, will never be able to bridge the hardware gap that exists between LCDs and e-ink.",1262163714

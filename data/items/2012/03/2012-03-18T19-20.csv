3720720,comment,3720332,3720633,3,0,pg,,,"See what a useful exercise it is to look at the actual
sentences I wrote?  Gone are the claims that I consider the
extra things you can do in a talk ""mere baggage"" 
(I said the opposite in the last paragraph) and that
""essays are baggage-free"" (I said the opposite in the 8th
paragraph).  Now all I'm being accused of is claiming that
having good ideas is most of writing well, and that
it is a smaller component of speaking well than writing well.<p>Frankly these seem such commonplace claims that I think
more people would accuse me of wasting the reader's time
with platitudes than saying things that are false.<p>For the sake of completeness I'll defend them anyway:<p>1. You can't explain something clearly if you don't
understand it yourself.  Your writing may be fine at the phonetic level, but you won't for example be able to use any metaphors.  Your audience will feel like they're being driven in a Ferrari over ploughed fields.<p>2. Who is generally considered to be better able to 
cause people to believe mistaken ideas, speakers or
writers?  When you imagine a demagogue, for example,
do you imagine someone speaking before an audience or 
sitting at a desk writing?",1332100739

3720654,comment,3719481,3720296,2,0,maxs,,,"Regarding IDEs: I completely agree with you.  And I say this as someone who's used Emacs and REPL for 10 years.<p>I find that I am generally faster in development (at least with new libraries) in Java, than I used to be in Ruby and Python.  This is all thanks to the ""discovery"" ability of IDEs.  (I admittedly never tried a Python or Ruby IDE.)<p>And I have the same feeling regarding refactoring.  It is not merely limited to renaming a method.  I find myself very often making major structural changes to my code.  Moving packages around, introducing interfaces, changing type signatures.  In this regard working with an IDE makes me feel like a ""software architect"", I get a big-picture of the project in a much faster and better way than I used to with purely a text editor.<p>I also feel I waste no time on boiler-plate code (which admittedly Java has a lot of).  In Netbeans (I am sure it's the same in Eclipse and IDEA) the code generation abilities are terrific.  For instance, I can just write ""class C implements Interface"", press Alt+Enter+Enter and see all interface methods written out and ready for me to fill in the implementation.<p>Regarding the REPL: I've found that with strict typing, I just end up knocking out the code that _I think_ should work, and then I test if it works.  I can sometimes type for 200-300 lines without running the code, then test it and see that it actually works.  Of course, sometimes it fails too: luckily Java debugging is easy and incredibly capable.<p>However, if you really want a Java REPL, you can have something a little bit similar with BeanShell (you can even embed it into NetBeans).",1332099516

I joined the company right as it was completing its ""merger"" (i.e. hostile takeover) with Nations Bank--a crummy, aggressive Southern bank with a penchant for fascist business models led by criminals Hugh McColl and his lackey Ken Lewis.<p>In the months that followed Nations Bank's acquisition of BofA, which, prior to the ""merger,"" only had domestic coverage on the West Coast and some of the Southwest, most of the key San Francisco leadership were either forced to resign or resigned in protest against the inevitable wave of dirty business dealings coming in from the South--this, of course, was Nations Bank's plan.<p>So, the company changed drastically over a period of several years during the last decade--and so did the business ethic. It became more militaristic, and Sigma 6 ""procedures"" were adopted (a lot of good that did...), and much of the new management either came directly from the military or from executive positions at other major retail companies such as Pepsi Cola, Best Buy, Home Depot--basically ANY line of business OTHER than banking. These people had no experience in banking, and that was ok, because BANKING just became RETAIL. Money and debt became a commodity to be sold to clients instead of managed responsibly.<p>Nations Bank of America then continued on an extremely irresponsible course of acquiring HUGE numbers of smaller banks across the country--artificially increasing stock value for several years. I remember my stock options doubling TWICE in one year because the value was such that the stock had to split. I took a nice trip to Europe in 2003, as a result. Fortunately, (or unfortunately...) I was younger and much more naive then...<p>However, depite the Bank's many dastardly doings (resulting directly from Congress/the Bush Administration's continued push to deregulate the banks; beginning, as we all know, with the Clinton administration) the TRUE error that led to the bank's ultimate downfall was the acquisition of Countrywide and perhaps, to a lesser extent, Merrill Lynch.<p>I still remember that, even during this time, getting a loan done for a client at BofA was a relatively difficult process. BofA was really late to the game in offering clients sub-prime mortgages and the like. Quite frankly, if you couldn't afford the loan, chances were that you wouldn't be able to get it at BofA. Risk management slowly started relenting when they started seeing the profits of its major competitors--and they toyed with the idea of providing subprime loans--but it never really got off the ground before the Financial Crisis. Countrywide, on the other hand...<p>So, Mr. Lewis chose (and was, in someways, apparently ""forced"") to acquire Merril Lynch and Countrywide--creating an UNholy trinity that not only decimated the once tremendous value of the company, but has virtually thrown it into a terminal state. The ""market"" won't correct anything, because no one will touch the BofA toxic waste dump with a 10 foot pole. Also, what is one to do with all the hopeless people who STILL maintain their assets and debt--and, god forbid, INVESTMENTS--with this company? Its reputation amongst people in the know is tarnished beyond repair--and the only reason the government IS helping it, in my opinion, is that with SO MANY incredible obligations and worthless assets (due to it's many irresponsible acquisitions), the government probably knows that it would probably be MORE trouble for the GLOBAL market to let them fail than to slowly ""bail"" them out with conditions. One could compare this to letting somebody die slowly in hospice as opposed to using a ""bomb"" to end his/her misery in a hospital full of innocent people...<p>Whew, that was long...I guess I needed to get some of this off my chest.<p>EDIT: spelling",1332099084

Design by contract is an attempt to address this. Client code can <i>only</i> refer to another object through a well-defined interface. Thus your limited scope is enforced by the type system itself. Furthermore, much of this discussion is about <i>perception</i> of complexity rather than actual complexity.<p>In python you can access any classes internals if you're persistent enough. However, the difficulty in doing so and the convention that says that's bad practice gives the perception of a separation, thus one does not need to be concerned about its implementation. It lowers the cognitive burden in using a piece of functionality.<p>Haven't you noticed this yourself? A simpler interface is much easier to use than a more complicated one. If you're familiar with python, perhaps you've used the library called requests, its a pythonic API for http reqeusts. Compare this to the core library API using urllib2. The mental load to perform the same action is about an order of magnitude smaller with requests than urllib2, and its because there are far more moving parts with the latter.<p>My contention is that if bits of data and code are exposed to you, it is essentially a part of the API, even if you never actually use it.

The beautiful thing about Python is how it's abstracting a lot of this away by providing functions which implicitly call ""magic methods"" which are either generated by the interpreter or can be defined by the programmer (ie, __iter__(), __next__(), __init__()), and by virtue of Duck Typing, which means an object defines itself by what it can do, not its identity or origin.<p>You'd never even notice a lot of this unless you dip into the internals of Python a bit.

If one's interest is in delivering a great speech, that does impugn upon great thinking.<p>However, the key is just don't give talks on ideas that are too fresh (unless you plan on using the feedback and dialogic nature of talks to your advantage -- but that's less 'talks' and more 'conversations' or Socratic dialogues, etc.). If the goal is to deliver a great speech, you have to have an idea that is fixed so that you can spend your energy applying it to the audience's situation.<p>Yes, in rare situations one can do both (dynamically eval and dynamically apply), but they are somewhat overlapping, competing tasks.<p>ETA. One more quick thought -- making this a long post:<p>I think a lot of public speaking is giving the audience opportunities to 'latch on' to what one is saying. And it's easiest to do this by repeating yourself in various different ways that may interest the listener (different listeners latch on based on different shared life experiences, etc.).<p>Essay writing is similar. But in that form, you give the reader an opportunity to pause at any time and re-read or just think about the material. This advantage in turn means that less repetition (however artfully enhanced in speech) is required.<p>People are also better at skimming to what they think is important in essays. So they will skim over structural 'ums' (style that they don't find helpfully repetitive). Whereas, in speech an audience will tend to latch onto whatever is repeated.<p>Hence, if you choose behavior that focuses on formulation of thoughts repetitively in waves, extemporaneously speaking is more natural. If you choose behavior that insists on sifting towards the truth (and I've seen that recording of PG writing an essay), then written words can be more natural. Everyone can do both with practice, but they are different I think.<p>It's incorrect to say one is more 'truthful' than the other. In aggregate, knowledge among #'s of people in the universe can be about the same with both (e.g., great speaking brings a lot of people a little bit forwards; great essay writing and thinking can bring a more limited set a little more forward -- but the total area may be the same at the end of the day... -- note, these are generalized examples based on a perceived average type of speech and average type of essay).",1332097475

3720543,comment,3720332,3720332,1,0,vibrunazo,,,"I agree with most of it. But it <i>seems</i> he is implying that learning to become a better speaker is linearly proportional, even inversely proportional to improving your ideas or your writing. I agree you probably make a better use of your time improving your ideas rather than your speech. But don't you think there are diminishing returns to how efficient use of time it's to improve ideas vs speech? Isn't there a point, after which, your idea is already good enough. That it's more efficient to spend time improving your speech instead of your ideas?<p>I believe so. And sometimes I think, maybe, pg crossed that line.",1332097407

A simple vector format is not enough, you need to define what parts should scale how, which are rigid, which are elastic.<p>I don't think higher resolution displays actually help, because the real limitation becomes the human eye.  Though the new display could use the 'old' normal sized icons as small ones, your eye couldn't distinguish some of the details that worked before.<p>Anyways, it is an interesting problem and one that I don't envy designers for.",1332097320

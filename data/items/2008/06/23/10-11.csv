If you don't want to talk about it it's okay but there is no point in discussing about a startup without knowing the business model. If we do, we are talking about something else than the startup.",1214218170
224994,comment,224407,224407,0,0,wataguy,,,"It's worth noting that in some parts of the world (including the US) there are days which are 23 hours long and others which are 25 hours long, which occur when daylight savings time starts and stops. (I'm guessing your calendar isn't high resolution enough to worry about leap seconds.) So if I'm reading your code aright, the timestamp will be off by an hour on two Sundays a year in places where DST is observed.<p>But to answer your original question, I'd have to say it depends. If the clever stuff is really much more efficient, or less likely to break in unusual circumstances, I say use it, but document it carefully. Otherwise, best to code it clearly.",1214217981

224988,comment,224985,224985,0,0,ntoshev,,,"In a current project I do mostly exploratory programming (figure out the code structure as I go), but I will probably also have automatic tests that exercise large chunks of the application at once, from user perspective, without going into any detail. These are supposed to serve as smoke tests, ringing the alarm if I broke anything big.",1214217465

224985,story,,,3,3,ntoshev,"Ask HN: What software engineering process for startups?",,"What kind of engineering process do you want for a startup?<p>Typically you want to iterate fast, adding/changing features as necessary. Unit test make code harder to change (you may need to fix broken tests) but also more reliable (you can be pretty sure you didn't miss anything if the unit test all pass). If you have many people working on the same code, you typically need to agree to certain things (""architecture"") in advance and set it in writing as a design doc. If it is just one or two guys writing code and talking to each other, isn't that too much overhead?<p>To set some baseline, Google apparently did design docs, code and design reviews, and unit tests from the start. OTOH, it seems PG doesn't write unit test, at least there were no unit tests in the Arc/Hacker News source code release. He obviously doesn't write specs or design docs as he prefers exploratory programming.<p>What do you practice and why?",1214217238

Like any other design tool, it should be a means to an end.<p>The thing that’s useful about reaching the point of absolute minimalism, then, is not that it’s the point at which you’ve achieved perfection, or even anything resembling your end goal. Rather, it’s the point at which you realize which of the things you’ve removed were actually important, because their absence brings them into stark focus.""</i><p>... and then proceded to talk about ways he went about making content actionable rather than have administrative cruft all over the page.",1214215779

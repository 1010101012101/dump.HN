480950,comment,479314,479525,0,0,yason,,,"Implementing a perfectly detailed spec isn't really programming per se. It's more like merely translating or codemonkeying. I think that having significant unknowns in there is an inherent part of programming, and the actual cases that don't are either rare or ridiculously trivial.<p>And it's pretty hard to quantify any unknowns. Somebody said that programmers do know when they're productive. I know when I am and that's basically whenever I write anything at all that I _know_ will contribute to the functional or algorithmic completion. Merely that constitutes productivity!<p>That means I know that ""if I keep doing this I will finish the program at some point"". Writing boilerplate doesn't count. If I keep slamming getters, setters, and a like into my source file twelve hours a day it won't make the actual program ever ready. All I'm typing in are effectively prerequisites.<p>Boilerplate doesn't count even if it's mandatory in the language I'm using: I'm not sure if I could ever feel productive with Java eventhough I know I would really, really have to write a hundred setters/getters in order to finish. The logical step that would make me productive on my own scale would be to scoop power from a better language.",1234597969

If you're looking for some accessible NLP tools, NLTK (<a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nltk.org/</a>) is nice. It's written in Python, and uses WordNet in several ways.<p>The author of ots isn't really interested in working on it anymore. A couple of the features are deprecated, but this isn't documented.",1234597536

Twitter doesn't have that advantage, if it takes twitter and identical amount of time to figure out how to make money as it did google, then Twitter could likely be in so much debt they go bankrupt.",1234596957

Kids are taught metric, roads signs are in kilometers, temperature in Celsius, but almost no Canadian can tell your their own weight in kilograms or their height in meters!<p>If the US ever went all the way metric, I think they'd still end up using all their legacy measurements for decades.  Certainly the US letter paper size isn't going anywhere -- everything is designed for it.  The chicken and the egg are both well established.",1234596142

If I was reviewing at the time this move came out, this is what I'd likely say: I thought the plot was simplistic and prayed on a naive thoughtless audience, it didn't explore any truly remarkable metaphysical ideas that hasn't been thought by teenagers watching too much TV with poorly defined goals.<p>Honestly, I don't think I'll ever need to see the movie again in my life because it didn't take a single iota of thought to connect the plot elements.",1234595933

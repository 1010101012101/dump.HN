he found himself<p>transformed in his bed into a PHP class.  He lay between clumsy pointed <p>brackets, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his soft-referenced <p>underbelly, poorly indented and divided into giant blocks with redundant loops <p>and parallel data structures. The tests were hardly able to cover it and seemed<p>ready to slide off any moment.  His many built-ins, pitifully feeble compared <p>to the bloated code they had to support, thrashed about helplessly <p>as he looked.",1196934161

   //I can easily manage 3-5 small tasks
   $i = 0;
  foreach ($arrayofupto5tasks as $value){
  $query->storeIntoDB($value);
  $execute->task($arrayofupto5tasks[$i]);
  $i++
  }

3. It's disappointing that your showDemo() function has a hard coded number 2 in it ($site = rand(0,2);) since you could get that from the array length.   And also the header() bit has an extra ' in it.<p>4. Your learn() function returns false in one case and doesn't return anything in others.",1196932975

I like that I don't have to worry about the sysadmin shit that I'd have to deal with on a regular basis with Linux, or FreeBSD, etc.",1196931920

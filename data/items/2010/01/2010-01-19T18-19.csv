1062842,comment,1062788,1062788,0,0,sophacles,,,"I think that the current set of filesystem ops is a nice base. The ""everything is a sequence of bytes"" actually works very well given the access methods on a low level. However I think there are two separate things that need some serious addressing.<p>First is lack of metadata intrinsic to the system. A lot of filesystems have such capability, but there are no standard APIs to access it. I think that if a standards body (cough POSIX cough) were to distill out a minimum set of searchable metadata functionality, a lot of fun could arise.<p>The other part is the file metaphor itself.  This leads to a lot of focus on moving, and putting, and copying. There is a largely under-utilized bit -- linking. We tend to associate filesystem trees with their paper counterparts, hence the above focus. However, with ln, you can create multiple hierarchies for the same set of files, organizing them different ways.  Similarly this doesn't allow for easy reasoning about things like unionfs.<p>All that being said, I don't thing this calls for a removal of the stream of bytes notion of files, in the end, such a thing pretty necessary. A good api/file format on top of the stream of bytes solves the problem just as well.",1263927391

Higher competition at all levels. Larger and larger gaps between the rich and the poor, the skilled and the unskilled, the well-connected and the commoner. These effects offset the materials comfort we gain from all these fantastic technological innovations.<p>Focus on and competition for material wealth does shift us away from certain communal bonds & feelings. To experience an extreme case, try visit a middle- or lower-end shopping mall in China, you can feel the intense greed and competitiveness between sellers. That's hyper-competition at work. We feel it a bit more abstractly in a developed country. But it's certainly there.<p>I bet many people who has watched Avatar actually want to live as a Navi'. Their lack of material wealth and powerful technologies are more than compensated for by community bonds, closeness to the beauty of nature, and minimal competition for status. Such a community actually exists. Many of them can be found in a more remote part of the world. Bhutan and certain communities of Buddhist monks, for example, come to mind.<p>For more on this, I recommend this TED talk by Matthieu Ricard on the habits of happiness:

What's the value of having both parents home for dinner?  A bunch of studies have shown that one of the best predictors for having successful, well-adapted children is how much time the family spends together.  But how do you quantify that?  You won't know what the exact payoff is until 10-15 years later, when the kids are well into their own careers and having their own children.  And it varies a lot from kid to kid - someone who's performing well academically with a supportive peer group needs a lot less parental involvement than a loner with no friends who's threatening to blow up the school.<p>Or another example: when I went to college, I believe the fin-aid formula was that the college would take 100% of my assets, based on my age and income.  That meant my gap year was revenue neutral - it didn't matter how much I worked or what I worked on, I wouldn't be able to keep any of it.  But that gave me the freedom to observe and to try things out, without the stress of trying to make a lot of money, and in the process I found my eventual career.<p>You don't want to run an economy like this - there needs to be some accountability so that people work on things that are actually useful.  But a high school grad who's time-limited to one year of work isn't going to accomplish anything actually useful anyway - instead, that gap year is an investment in perspective, a way to understand more of the world before you commit to four years in college.<p>The same thing often comes up in research - a short-sighted focus on increased economic output leads you to miss opportunities that have no obvious dollar value attached, but can be big economy-changers in the long run.

Again, it is inaccurate to lump this into the so-called 79% tax rate.<p>Forbes made this even worse by applying these expenses to the top 60,000 of the person's 120,000 income, and calling the entire thing the ""marginal tax rate.""<p>By my calculations, we're talking about a 27.5% marginal tax rate on the top 60k of her income, and then whatever the tax rate would be on her lower 60k of income.  I'm going to estimate the tax rate is something like 20%, which is far less horrifying than 79%.<p>It's still true that income differences will affect financial aid and mortgage payments, so Forbes should point that out, but it's totally irresponsible to call this a 79% tax rate.",1263926252

At $120,000 she would pay $16,500 a year more in federal and state taxes, wouldn't qualify for the five-year $12,000-a-year cut in her mortgage payments she's applying for and would be eligible for $19,000 a year less in need-based college financial aid.<p>It's a bit disingenuous to include lack of financial aid as a ""tax"" on her income .I assume the college is private? Regardless, she's not paying another $19,000 to the government, just not getting it in aid from another institution.<p>Without the financial aid ""tax"", her marginal tax rate is 47.5% for that $60,000. Not great, but not absurdly high considering it includes federal and state taxes (which in NY are quite high).<p>> Work isn't the only middle-class virtue that is getting punished.

Yeah.  Benefits programs are filled with this kind of unintended side effect.  But to write this kind of blanket argument cautioning against them seems awfully partisan to me.

A lower paying position is still full time work, after all.  The contention that making less is ""bad for the economy"" isn't really sound. Downward wage pressure in high-paying jobs is a good thing for the export economy and a good thing for profits (companies are paying historically high fractions to their most highly compensated employees).<p>[3] That is: gate the income to a small range just big enough to be affected by the loss of financial and mortgage aid, but not so big that it dillutes back to the overall tax rate of ~38%.

I don't care if you're a math PhD, I don't even care if you know a decent amount about numerical methods.  Whatever code you're going to put together to do the job will be inferior to what a mature library can do, simply because the library has been put through many iterations and has had a lot more time to get patched up to handle all those special cases (usually related to finite precision or discretization) that Real Math doesn't have to worry about.  And it will probably be vastly more optimized than anything you'll put together, because it's spent years of heavy use in some critical research environments.<p>The only time you should be writing your own math code (beyond simple arithmetic) is if no mature libraries are available to you.

1062699,comment,1062525,1062613,0,0,JabavuAdams,,,"Gaussian elimination. Remember where you subtract multiples of one row from another, in order to get zeros below the diagonal? That way you can back-solve a system of equations by reading off solutions starting with the bottom-right corner.<p>The result of carrying out the elimination steps is a triangular matrix with all zeros below the main diagonal. Call it U, for ""upper"".<p>The elimination steps themselves can be encoded as a matrix, rather than describing them in words. For instance,  ""subtract 2 times row 1 from row 2"" is the matrix:<p>[ 1 0 0]<p>[-2 1 0]<p>[ 0 0 1]<p>So, to solve the system, you can perform elimination on A x = b, which gives you two matrices (U, and the elimination steps L). In some sense, you've factored A in to L and U.<p>Example:<p>Using Strang's terminology, let's call the matrix that ""eliminates (i.e. sets to 0) the (i,j) entry"" Eij<p>So, to solve a 3x3 system A x = b, you want to do elimination as: (E32 E31 E21) A = U<p>I.e.<p>1) Take A and subtract some multiple of row 2 from row 1, to put 0 in (2,1)<p>2) Take the result and subtract some multiple of row 3 from row 1 to put 0 in (3,1)<p>3) Take the result and subtract some multiple of row 3 from row 2 to put 0 in (3,2)<p>Now the goal of elimination is to get an uppper-triangular matrix U. I.e. if you were solving some system of equations in x, y, z, then because U is triangular, you could just read off the answer to z. Then plug that into the equation for row 2 to solve for y, then plug that into the equation for row 1 to solve for x. That's back-substitution.<p>BUT, let's return to our operations. We have:<p>E32 E31 E21 A = U<p>(E32 E31 E21) A = U<p>inverse(E32 E31 E21) (E32 E31 E21) A = inverse(E32 E31 E21) U<p>I A = inverse(E32 E31 E21) U<p>Now, it just so happens that the inverse of (E32 E31 E21) is lower-triangular. I.e. all entries above the diagonal are zero, so let's call it L.<p>I A = L U<p>A = L U<p>LU-decomposition. Or ""factorization"", since we've factored A into two matrices: L, and U.",1263924072

Maybe the solution is to make comments work more like submissions, e.g. new top-level comments start out dead and need two upvotes before they go live. This is essentially how all new stories start out, and it seems to be working reasonably well.<p>Also, part of the issue with scaling is that there are some types of comments that are fine to post when the userbase is small, but that aren't ok to post as the userbase grows-- even if they add value in some way. So the problem isn't just coming from new users posting bad comments, it's coming from old users posting the same comments. So maybe some sort of radical experiment to try to refocus the discussions wouldn't be such a bad idea, at least to see how it goes.",1263924039

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist are gaining increasing attention as drug candidates for multiple central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nicotine addiction.[24][25]<p><a href=""http://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=130036"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=130036</a><p><i>Interestingly enough, some pharmaceutical companies (like Targacept) have caught onto this phenomenon, and they have already started manufacturing nicotinic drugs (agonists of nicotinic receptors), which are to be marketed for the treatment of ADHD. They are trying to make nictoine more &quot;safe&quot;...<p>These so called nicotinic drugs, such as AZD3480 (Ispronicline), are still in the clinical trial phase. In fact, the drug is in phase trial II, which means that it has passed the so-called primary &quot;safety test&quot;, and there were no alarming adverse reactions. See: <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00683462"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00683462</a>.<p>These nicotinic drugs are a refreshing new technology, because they indirectly act on dopamine through the release of another neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. These drugs are much unlike classic stimulants, which act upon the dopamine reward pathway directly, increasing abuse potential.<p>I decided to put the last question to the test. For the past week, I weaned myself of the Ritalin, and I bought transdermal nicotine patches. Bear in mind that I have never smoked a cigarette in my life, and none of my immediate family members smoke! So, what I did was highly risky as nicotine has been dubbed as a &quot;highly addictive&quot; drug.\n...<p>On these so-called &quot;dangerous&quot; 5 mg patches, not only was I able to focus better and sleep better, but my mood was much more stable. Also, the &quot;come-down&quot; is nothing like that which I experienced with psychostimulants (more specifically, Ritalin). Now, I am not saying that we should all start smoking. But, I&#x27;m saying that we should keep an open mind and to keep our therapeutic options open.</i>",1380335761

Some are heuristic and some are statistical.<p>Putting my grad-student hat on, from a Bayesian perspective, they seem to be effectively &quot;marginalizing&quot; the distribution on &quot;facts&quot; over the hidden identity-of-Tom variable given the event and your current network:<p>$ p(facts | network, event) = \int p(facts | identity) p(identity | network, event) d identity $<p>The app&#x27;s output seems to be, effectively, samples from that &quot;facts&quot; distribution, which can be generated by taking samples from the identity distribution and accepting/rejecting based on likelihood. It&#x27;s a more formal way to look at fuzzy logic systems like this one. The cool thing is that you can eventually plug other things into the system, such as taking into account the distribution over types of facts that the current user likes to look at, in a mathematically sound way. But it&#x27;s rare (imho) to come across systems like this outside of academia.",1380335525

I guess those are the three things that are core to my being as an American. I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit this either after working with many expats in the States who practically go insane trying to find even simple tastes from home to center themselves.<p>a) the kind of breakfast that&#x27;s common to the English speaking world (I don&#x27;t want to say Western, because breakfasts on the European mainland aren&#x27;t it). In a pinch some fried eggs and a pastry of some kind with some coffee will do.<p>b) Tex-Mex food. Taco Bell in particular (if you can charitably call that Tex-Mex). I&#x27;ve stood in line for 2 hours and paid $5 a taco once at an overseas Taco Bell I needed it so bad.<p>But really, finding even passable Tex-Mex outside of the U.S. is frustratingly hard. I&#x27;ve even eaten &quot;Mexican&quot; meat pies in Australia I was so desperate for the taste. They did not satisfy.<p>c) Any kind of African-American music...which is odd since I don&#x27;t normally like most of it, but hearing it on the radio after a long time away from home is the sweetest sound I&#x27;ve ever heard and has symbolically told me that yes, I&#x27;m really finally home.<p>One time, after a very extended stay in Germany, when I could practically feel the sausage and cold cuts oozing from my pores I was thinking about tossing it in and going home until I came across a Soul Food restaurant in Vilsek [1]. I sat down, ordered some fried catfish! , sweet ice tea, collard greens and cornbread and sat there for three hours listening to background jazz music. For those three hours I was absolutely transported into the symbolic heart of Americana and left there absolutely renewed and psychically refreshed. I think the staff there knew what I was going through and came and kept the sweet tea filled over some light conversation.<p>I don&#x27;t normally like any of those foods or jazz but sitting there completely recentered me mentally and I went back to my job for the next few weeks and finished it without problem.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.angelossoulfood-vilseck.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelossoulfood-vilseck.com/</a>",1380335487

Market forces push insurance to offer specialised coverages that match your risks. Start smoking? Hey, we&#x27;re going to bump you in the next bracket...<p>And in case the only insurance offered are a clear rip off (extended warranty kind of thing), you can always walk off and say &quot;no thanks&quot;.<p>Now, imagine a new government program that decides to accept everyone because capitalisms is obviously flawed and full of greedy people.<p>The cost of such an insurance will be, for certain individuals, higher than what they would be with a targeted coverage. (The office workers for example.) Those individuals have now every incentives to leave this insurance and either take a private one, or even take none at all.<p>This causes the remaining few in the government insurance to have higher premiums, causing even more people to leave and check for alternatives.<p>The only way to prevent this exodus is to <i></i>force<i></i> everyone to stay with a single, monolithic insurance coverage. Even (especially!) those who are healthy.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that you are OK with the concept, because without the government, the sick, single moms and children are facing certain death...<p>Because this super insurance is working outside of the market, you can&#x27;t evaluate the value it provides. (If you force someone to buy an ice cream cone $36 at gunpoint, is it really worth $36? Maybe, maybe not...) This in itself is a huge problem, because you never know when you are wasting too much resource to try to solve a problem. Would this money better spent financing schools? Perhaps it would be better to distribute better food to poor families? Again, it&#x27;s outside the market so you&#x27;ll probably never know. While there&#x27;s an infinity of bad/suboptimal ideas, there&#x27;s only one or a handful good. Now pick one and &#x27;hope&#x27;. Throw in a little political games in it, and you&#x27;ll probably never end up with what you were expecting to begin it.<p>But there&#x27;s yet another, more &#x27;local&#x27; problem. Now that you have your too-big-to-fail insurance, how can you keep it in check? Should it cost $1k to process a claim, or $10k? When is your administration too big? You can compare yourself to some other insurance companies, but that&#x27;s assuming you didn&#x27;t wipe out the entire market (which you have to, eventually, to prevent the exodus). Even with comparison, you never have a decisive proof that it&#x27;s too big. How do workers react, when you try to resize an industry, without the proof that it needs to be done? If, in addition, it&#x27;s a government subsidized industry, good luck ever making it smaller.<p>The end result is a &quot;service&quot; that not a single soul knows how much it should cost, but with a constant pressure to increase the funding.<p>Also, <i>this is without taking into consideration some pharmaceutical firms&#x27; lobbying</i>.\nImagine how happy they would be, if none of their consumers were the payers!\n(It&#x27;s already a problem in the U.S. IMO; people use drugs but just forward the bill to their insurance.)<p>These problems only grow with time. While a government insurance might be &quot;not so bad&quot; in the beginning, every structures and forces around will deteriorate it. And before you know it, you won&#x27;t ever be able to talk against any of its part, because then you&#x27;ll be a greedy capitalist that wants to leave the poor and sick die a painful death.<p>This is the trap I&#x27;m talking about.

6460585,comment,6460425,6460508,16,0,Almaviva,,,"Are the complaints about PHP even controversial? The built in library functions are a mess, and mostly terrible. The syntax and basic language are overly verbose and have layers upon layers of cruft. The type and object systems are grafted on, and have so many gotchas and inconsistencies that it takes many months to understand enough of them to be very productive in the language. The aspects of PHP that were intended to make it simple (like pretending types don&#x27;t exist) actually make it more difficult to reason about precisely. I don&#x27;t think anyone who knows anything else would ever choose PHP for a fun personal project.<p>Despite this, there is nothing in PHP that prevents you from doing the thing you want to do, however you want to do it. As projects become larger and involve more time and people, the fine grain of line syntax fades out of view, and all that is left is the large scale design decisions, which are similar in any language. And this is what ultimately determines the technical success or failure of software.",1380334008

There are two left on the US and they are extremely highly-regarded in effectiveness. They&#x27;re more effective than the typical SSRIs of today but they are sadly not as prescribed today due to over-blown fears of interactions.

To make matters worse is that nobody has made a significant effort to do real testing to define safe levels so most users are left to responsible trial and error.<p>I.E. read this about pepperoni, debunking the conventional &quot;wisdom&quot;:<p>> BACKGROUND: Continuous refinement of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) diet has resulted in much reduced and simplified recommendations that attempt to balance safety and practicality. In the spirit of evidence-based practice, dietary restrictions should be based on carefully documented case reports and valid tyramine analyses. Residual concerns have focused on combination foods such as pizza and a variety of soy products. We determined the tyramine content of pizzas and a variety of soy products in order to refine dietary recommendations for use with MAOIs. METHOD: High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of tyramine content was performed on a variety of pizzas, soy sauces, and other soybean products. A tyramine level of 6 mg or less was considered safe. RESULTS: No significant tyramine levels were found in any of the pizzas, including those with double pepperoni and double cheese. Marked variability was found in soy products, including clinically significant tyramine levels in tofu when stored for a week and high tyramine content in one of the soy sauces. CONCLUSION: Pizzas from large chain commercial outlets are safe for consumption with MAOIs. However, caution must be exercised if ordering pizzas from smaller outlets or gourmet pizzas known to contain aged cheeses. All soybean products should be avoided, especially soy sauce and tofu. Individualized counseling and continuous surveillance of compliance are still essential.\n><p>Bonus:<p>Tranylcypromine enhancement of nicotine self-administration.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17412372"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17412372</a><p>The monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine enhances the discriminative stimulus effect of nicotine in rats.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17912044"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17912044</a>",1380333945

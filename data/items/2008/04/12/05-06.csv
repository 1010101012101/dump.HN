All the power to them.<p>If they're close to getting acquired, this could be a very good strategy, and could even be a catalyst for an acquisition altogether.  This is a VERY nice end game move.<p>Those ""big"" lawsuits don't happen till normally later in the game.  Those ""big"" lawsuits also take a very long time, and in the mean time traffic would continue to skyrocket (it already has past ustream.tv by far).  I think this is definately a winning strategy, and predict the lawsuit will either A) never happen, or B) will happen far too late to put them out of business.<p>If jtv had started pimping out pirate traffic a year ago when they first started, things would be different.  They're going to make bank off of this.  Just watch.",1207979930
161697,comment,161269,161533,0,0,staunch,,,"I recall Zuckerberg admitting at SXSW they only valued it at that so that Microsoft could invest their cash and not suck up a big percentage of the company. That would mean not even Zuckerberg pretends its worth $15 billion. It seems a bit lame to repeat this valuation as if Zuckerberg is running around yelling ""My company is worth $15 billion!"" because he's definitely not doing that.",1207979929

I can understand that people have problems with some of their content, but then just don't vote it up. It's as simple as that. To ban a site entirely that does have some legitimate content simply because you don't like it is a very bad precedent to set.",1207979625

161692,comment,161380,161380,0,0,Prrometheus,,,">It started with a question: could software help people connect in real life? Nothing we knew about was any good. Nobody sane would sift through lists of events online. Dating sites mostly sucked. Put people in the position of a judge, and romance cannot bloom. Chat rooms sucked. There are trolls and perverts everywhere. And the internet at large has no location. Rarely would you find someone nearby.<p>Ah, local social software. A chat room that you can only access if you are close enough to start a conversation in real life. A forum that you can only post to if you are sitting in the same coffee shop.<p>I hear that they are working on such things for the iPhone.<p>I can't wait until the world realizes that social software is not social unless you actually meet people through it.",1207979189

I thought I'd add that while the competing product is very polished, and run by an excellent company, they're not exactly the same.<p>It's sort of like Mint.com and Quicken. They both help you do the same thing but they approach it completely differently.<p>Our product is going to do A, B, and C but the focus is on item A.

A small on-screen arrow called a ""cursor"" can be moved around the page you are currently viewing with a navigation device called a mouse and this is used to browse and navigate documents.

""Share the love"" / ""concert-savvy friend"" just an example. There are other bits and pieces too. You could say that this is the general trend, what attracts yc, and so on. of course. that would be the value of their vision. I don't have any arguments about that at all. And it's a good think that they can see it. but my argument is that this is the theme of yc.<p>Another thing I've noticed is how features that have been around for a long time (web time), are slightly ""modified"" (most times more simplified, either for the good reason of simplification, or simply because of lack of technical experience, or in the worst case because of bad copying) many examples of this. but since you brought up dropbox, the first thing brings to my mind is box.net. again I'm not saying anything bad about it. I'm sure its better since I know about box.net and their not that great anyway. but my point is that there are not that many selections that are either new innovative products or an old idea that you could say wow this is how it should be implemented. say Google for example. And, they have common theme to them. no not from the perspective of the consumer or what the products are.<p>I really don't know about how yc views things but the theme of yc is clear. alteast to some degree. either because that's simply the result of their total work and it just produces this, or intention by design to move in this direction or both.<p>if you go to many vc's site and look under their portfolio many times you can find a common theme in their select.",1207977278

161669,comment,161604,161604,0,0,dkokelley,,,"The way I see it, there are two scenarios:<p>1. Your co-founder is right, your competitors have created something way beyond what you could ever create, and your venture is not worth pursuing. If this is the case, you must either rethink your approach or shut down.<p>2. Your founder is wrong, and has been scared away by a little competition. Many people can be scared away when competition comes up. These people are not the ones you want as co-founders. <i>Do NOT drag these people along for the ride!</i> This person will drain your energy and slowly sink your company. There are bigger bumps than competitors showing up, and a founder that will bolt at the first sign of trouble is not who you want on your team.<p>The problem is that discerning between the two can be difficult, if not impossible for someone so closely involved as another founder. Have family, friends, and colleagues you trust talk to you about your situation to help gauge which of the situations this is. Also keep in mind that it is not necessarily one or the other. It could be mix of both 1 and 2, so be aware of this.",1207977208

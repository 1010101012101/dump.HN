However, after receiving the update, I am actually looking for ways to go back to 2.1.  I haven't noticed any visual improvements, in fact the Sense UI seems more sluggish.  Also, HTC and Verizon jammed in a ton of uninstallable software with Froyo.  I now have Skype Mobile, Amazon MP3, My Verizon Mobile, some ""Stocks"" app, City ID (which continues from 2.1) and a bunch more that you can't remove and it all randomly starts running when I'm not looking.  The battery life (which used to be great, much better than a buddy's Evo) is terrible as a result.  Google really needs to reign it in.",1283871597

Every decision regarding graphical attributes of the calculator were parameterized by pull-down menus. You could select line thicknesses, button sizes, background patterns, etc.<p>Steve took a look at the new program, and immediately started fiddling with the parameters. After trying out alternatives for ten minutes or so, he settled on something that he liked.

This is one area that they absolutely need to work on urgently.<p>On the iPhone everything is near instant, or if you have to wait then there is <i>clear</i> indication that the phone is doing something.<p>On Android we get the familiar (but unwelcome) choppyness that we know from Desktop Operating Systems. Button presses will not always be recognized immediately (or sometimes not at all). Page transitions are not always smooth, often they are choppy or do outright freeze in the middle. It is very often <i>not</i> obvious that you have to wait; i.e. a button press will cause the UI to freeze momentarily but without giving you any feedback that your press was actually registered.<p>And ofcourse the unpredictable delays when opening or switching apps.
A multi-second delay before opening the phonebook or dialer is simply unacceptable for a <i>phone</i>.<p>This description actually makes it sound worse than it is. Despite these problems I'm quite happy with my Samsung Galaxy overall. But they need to work on this stuff if they want the perception of android as ""slow"" and ""choppy"" to change. Because that's the first thing you notice when playing around with an android device in the store.",1283871516

The hourly ranged mentioned in the article fits exactly what we charge (although on the lower side), however the time required is way off base. If you come with fully developed wireframes, etc, they're sure to include 3-10 things which would take quite a bit longer than an alternative, or will contain lots of things better put in a version 2 product.

It has lots of constraints that normal PC's and the Web do not have to deal with, and so it's harder to train qualified devs for it still. However, the projects created on this platform can be done economically with the correct guidance.<p>If you try to run the project too completely, try to be too involved, you can very well get the prices and timelines in that article.<p>Even if you have the cash to spend 30k on the App: My suggestion, get something done for the 7-10k range which satisfies part of your original vision, release, then work on adding more.

Some of it might even be useful (e.g spending time networking incurs costs - conference fees, travel, etc c.f #10)<p><i>#2 Keep a records of all employees in investee companies</i> - Hmmm, nice idea but not too sure about the data-protection issues. As an employee, do I want my company's investors keeping tabs on me? Also, as a CEO, do I want my investors to keep tabs on my employees? What if we disagree about the impending death of the company and they try to pre-emptively poach someone for another portfolio company?  (Perhaps this already happens).<p><i>#4 Have everyone tweet/blog authentically</i> - Not convinced that all people in firm need to do this.  One or two high profile folks should be enough.  Public writing is not easy so leave it to those who want to do it.<p><i>#7 Have offices that look and cost like startup offices</i> - If you're running a big VC firm, I'm not sure you can get away with 'startup' offices.  Startup office are cheap because they <i>have</i> to be. Not necessarily because it's the <i>best</i> way for the company to operate.  I see no reason why a VCs office needs to be anything like a startup's office.<p><i>#11 Have far fewer meetings with startups</i> - i.e kiss fewer frogs. I don't think this works. You only get to do this if you're a very well known, successful VC because then good deals find you. Otherwise you need to be meeting lots of startups.<p><i>#14 Use brand to...recruit top talent (particularly engineers) from top schools [for portfolio companies]...</i> - This is quite interesting, but I don't see it being particularly successful. People want to join companies, not necessarily join whatever portfolio company the VC thinks they might be useful for.

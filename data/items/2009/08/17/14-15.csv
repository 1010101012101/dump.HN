768226,comment,768137,768137,0,0,gamache,,,"I wrote this comment for the blog but I am unsure that it posted correctly there:<p>BMW Motorrad is similar to Apple in many ways:<p>* Both were early players in their respective markets.  Moreso than many other manufacturers, they have a lot of history to draw from.<p>* Both are known for their design and sense of style.  A BMW motorcycle, like an Apple device, is almost instantly recognizable once you know the visual cues of each.<p>* Both are premium products at premium prices, designed against disposability.  A BMW motorcycle and an Apple computer will typically outlast 2-3 of the average competitor's products, while costing about 1.5x as much.<p>* Both have absolutely rabid followings, winning the kind of fanaticism you can only produce by decades of selling beautiful products that perform beautifully.<p>The BMW turn signals map closely to the Apple 1-button mouse.  Is it the most functional design?  Nah.  But the customers barely care.  The design is functional enough, and it conjures the brand very effectively.<p>Here, both BMW and Apple ""missed"" the waves of standardization to user controls; their controls were always good enough from the start, however, and since the users didn't make a stink about it, both highly successful manufacturers left well enough alone.<p>Looking from our vantage point in the present, sure, someone moving to a BMW or Apple interface will notice a few differences (or, in your words, it will be ""inconsistent with virtually every other"").  But when you look at it from the point in time at which these interfaces were designed, both were groundbreaking and best-of-breed.  Macs had a mouse when their closest competitors would draw some text like ""C:>"" and drool at you.  BMW had foot-shift and hand-clutch when their closest competitors had suicide-shift and clutch pedals.  It took another 40 or 50 years for motorcycles to agree upon right-hand throttle, even.<p>Personally, I don't buy the left-brain/right-brain argument you put forth, and I consider the danger pretty low because turn signals get the absolutely lowest priority when I am riding and need to react to emerging situations (that's pretty-talk for ""when the dude in the F-150 aims at me suddenly"").  I ride a Honda and I am pleased with the left-thumb directional controls, but I bet I could get used to a BMW pretty quickly.... and any donations to test this theory are gratefully accepted.  But in any case, I think you need to see some more of the history behind the controls before you can use them as a UI teaching tool.",1250521174

768224,comment,766435,766573,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"I think the passive aggressive solutions exist because most people have terrible communication skills. It seems like it all comes from the assumption that if you actually disagree with someone or want them to behave a different way around you, you must be a huge asshole that no one will respect.

768220,story,,,8,11,jacquesm,"Ask HN: Why is concurrent programming so hard ?",,"This is one of those things that keep coming up over and over again, compared to 'regular' programming programming concurrent (massively parallel) systems is hard.<p>Lots harder than the simple relation between the number of threads of execution and a single thread should make you suspect.<p>Unless your problem is one that is easily parallelized you are left with limited alternatives.<p>Usually this is put down to either architectural issues (von Neumann vs alternatives), sometimes to the difficulties of locking and such, most times to how easy a program can be parallelized.<p>But even the latter is an effort on the part of the programmer, rarely of the environment the program is written in (though there are some interesting developments in that area).<p>I have this weird theory that it has to do with something completely different:<p>Our brains are not wired to have 'multiple parallel threads' of consciousness.<p>So we have a hard time envisioning in our sequentially wired brains what is going on in a parallel program, which means we feel much more 'at home' in a sequential environment.<p>It takes a good bit of training to get around that limitation and even then it is not easy.<p>So we tend to 'break up' our programs into sequential pieces of code, each running in parallel with the rest, and the spots where they meet, like trains using a railroad track, have to be scheduled to make things execute in the proper sequence.<p>This makes me wonder if we are truly capable of devising a method of parallel execution that will feel 'natural'.<p>Even in the real world, when we 'concentrate' we single out a thread from all the possible inputs and go step-by-step to analyze that one single process.<p>What are your thoughts on this ?",1250520948

768218,comment,767419,767737,0,0,skolor,,,"I'm not so sure about this. In high school, I spent the first two years doing everything using a TI-83+ (Algebra II and Pre-Calc). However, when my TI-83 stopped working (and got a TI-89), I stopped using a calculator almost all together. For both years of Calculus, I did all the work by hand, turning to the calculator only at the end when I needed a final result (and usually tried to do that in my head/with pen and paper anyway).<p>I would say the that helped me immensely with understanding not only understanding the material, but being able to work it out faster. I'm now able to roughly estimate (within a decimal point or two) most basic math problems in only slightly longer than it does for most students to do it on a calculator. In fact, I tend to work problems out significantly faster than most students who simply punch everything into a calculator and get the results from there, if only because I understand the problem better from working it out by hand and know better how to approach it. Being able to estimate square roots in my head has been vastly beneficial, and would be a skill well worth knowing.",1250520898

My experience tells me that you have to be very careful when mixing bloggers and journalists from publishing companies (if that's what you intend to do). A lot of journalists perceive bloggers as a threat. Although that seems naive I think it's a normal reaction.<p>In my view it's necessary to involve bloggers but I don't think of them as journalists. They have other principles of investigating and sourcing and a different style of writing. Don't get me wrong, they're important and the fact that free blog providers enable potentially anyone out there to speak their minds on the big stage is a small revolution. Although not on one level with Gutenberg or the invention of the Net itself, like some say. But bloggers certainly are not the key to saving traditional journalism :)",1250518294

768134,comment,768057,768057,0,0,dkersten,,,"Ahhh! I love this one. FP was such an interesting language and point-free programming is still one of my favourite styles.<p>I like this topic too (breaking away from von Neumann style programming) because I believe that it is useful for some, but NOT all, problems. There are problems which are better solved with other paradigms. For example, mathematical algorithms and inherently sequential calculations (issuing commands to hardware often has to be strictly sequential, for example) - I'm sure I missed a load - are very well suited to von Neumann style programming. There are other tasks, however, which are not so well suited, as we have recently discovered: concurrent programming, for example, is pretty difficult in this style of programming.<p>I'm sure theres plenty of alternatives, but the one I'm currently interested in is dataflow, which appears to solve concurrency inherently and without programmer input, though obviously, being implemented on von Neumann hardware means the implementations may not make the best use of this.<p>Dataflow is interesting, to me, because it seems to be a minor step from imperative programming - a step which could have been taken arbitrarily back when computing was in its infancy. I don't believe that it was, I believe that imperative was chosen because it was, indeed, most suited to what early programmers were trying to achieve and the flaws (mainly concurrency) only became apparent a long time later. Its interesting to think about what programming would have been like if dataflow were the programming paradigm of choice, though. Ultimately, a nice balance between both would be best, IMHO.<p>I see it like this: in imperative programming, you have a stream of instructions, which is routed through the data it processes (that is, the next instruction is chosen by the previous instruction and the operate on a static (non moving) block of data) whereas in dataflow, you have static instructions with streams of data (that is, the data is routed by the instructions, much like logic gates route electrical signals in digital circuits). Conceptually, the difference is very small - but it makes a big difference.<p>I think theres values in both ways and would love a programming model which allowed both of these seamlessly. Oz provides some dataflow constructs, but IMHO they're too limited (and also the implementation should make use of these for implicit and transparent concurrency).<p>Thoughts?",1250518132

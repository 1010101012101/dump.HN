Imho, the ideal team size for a software start-up is three - three excellent, top-notch hackers, but just three. More than that and the communication overheads start to hurt your early progress and flexibility.<p>That's not to say that the three hackers won't want additional help later, which is where you could come in. But that's only the case until the tools get good enough that the three can continue as three pretty much forever.<p>The increased productivity of tools like Rails means that larger teams are actually at a disadvantage. This to me is the greater threat on your industry. In my start-up, I don't want us to grow to a mega-team of hundreds of people. In fact, we've already had numerous discussions about having it as part of our business model to keep the company as small as possible and outsource any work that's not core to the business - so that we can ensure that the only people we employ are top notch.<p>Otherwise, your analysis is good - but imho this factor could be the chink in your armour.",1234868383

It's fascinating how many decisions you'll come to that were taken in the original code too.<p>The good thing about doing it this way is that you'll really understand why those decisions were made. Imho you learn the most this way.",1234868016
484355,comment,483187,483875,0,0,vc_investor,,,"PG's argument as I read it is that there's a shift in comparative market power towards entrepreneurs qua producers because the barriers to innovation have fallen so their funding needs are less.<p>I agree that companies pursuing small opportunities (web 2.0 features, iPhone/Facebook apps, etc.) will face little competition from funded competitors. That's because there's little money to be made out of those innovations. In the short term, that may even apply to situations where the prize is large (Skype, Google, Facebook, etc.).<p>But in the longer term, economic systems operate in equilibrium, so you have to think about marginal not absolute factors. In equilibrium, competition will increase, and in turn cost of supply (of developers, airtime, etc.) will scale, in proportion to the size of the prize. Only proprietary cost advantages offer sustainable competitive advantage, whereas free software tools, cloud hosting, and cheap airtime benefit all contestants equally. When credible signalling costs are high and transparency is low, relative early advantage tends to be self-reinforcing. So when the pie is big enough, unfunded start-ups will find their marginal rate of growth just as constrained by a lack of capital as it's ever been, and will lose the initiative to better-funded rivals accordingly. Which means VCs will be just as essential in supporting high-value product development as ever.<p>Of course, you might say that the rate at which the marginal utility of wealth declines is high enough that few rational entrepreneurs will be motivated to pursue big new product innovations given the higher likelihood of failure compared to developing iPhone apps. In practice I tend to think that success for most entrepeneurially-minded individuals is as much about recognition (a positional good), as it is about absolute wealth. And again, in equilibrium, position goods are definitively scarce, meaning the arms race for status will continue ad infinitum.<p>There's an old adage about how to make money: sell bullets in the war without end. That's what VCs do. And the invention of the taser doesn't put gun makers out of business. On the contrary, it increases their utility.",1234867973

484344,comment,483605,484079,0,0,swombat,,,"I'd add that the ""hire a contractor to build things out"" thing works well for an easily defined thing like a cafe, but much less so for a web application. If the contractor is honest, the first thing they'll say when you try to fix the price is:<p>""I don't know what you're trying to build (even though we've spent an hour talking about it). That's in great part because <i>you</i> don't know what you're trying to build. We'll find that out as we go along, once we get some users in front of it and figure out what they really want. Therefore, it would be dishonest of me to quote a likely cost. I can timebox it for you: It will take less than two years, and more than a month. But that's all the accuracy I can give you. I can also tell you how long it's likely to take to build the first iteration - but not how many more iterations there will be after that.""<p>Unfortunately, most contractors won't do that and so you'll find yourself with an ever increasing bill or with a piece of useless code.",1234867166

It's to do with the level of equity involved. Someone with 2% equity is a sucker. Someone with 30% equity (in a 3-people start-up) is a founder.<p>If you're looking to hire someone who has the ability to pull a whole start-up out of their ass (through their competence and extremely hard work), then it means they could just as well work on their own start-up (where they'd have 100% equity). So why should they join you, unless you're offering a significant portion of ownership and you add value to that start-up equivalent to your share ownership?",1234866868

484335,comment,484137,484199,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think YC and any other incubator are operating in the same space, but not necessarily in competition. That sounds like a contradiction, but the way I see it that funding startups (and I only have limited experience in this field so be gentle in your rebukes :) )is more about getting the right mix of people, ideas and money than it is about just the money.<p>A vc should - at that stage - bring a lot more to the table than just cash, and if the chemistry isn't working out well then that can be because of the team, but it could also very well be the vc that doesn't work well with a specific party. So, more vc's in a certain region will make it easier to find the right 'mix' without any competition taking place.<p>One startup I'm involved in is now in its third year, they have raised about 200K in funding from 8 different parties, mostly angel investors but also one corporate investor, the team is working out quite well after some initial shake-out.<p>I can fully imagine that the past would have looked different if we had not 'clicked' on a personal level with the founders, but if we had not and they would have found traction with other investors I would not have seen that as competitor running away with our business, simply a mismatch of characters.<p>I think most vc presentations that bomb will do so on a personal level rather than on the ideas presented, in fact I would be surprised if there were not several teams pitching roughly the same idea to a number of vcs at the same time (and sometimes even to the same vc...).<p>The short version of all this, first of all it is about you and the vc getting on the same page, second there is the quality of the idea and your plans for executing that idea, third there is the money.<p>The last two are 'fixable', the first is not.",1234866681

They are concerned with the other issues.</i><p>That's because ""working for equity"" is exactly the same as ""working for free"". Equity has no value until the company has proven itself. If you were working for a company that said that you have a 95% chance of not getting your salary, and a 5% chance of getting your salary 2 years later, you would consider that working for free.<p>If you accept the idea of working for free (which many of us founders do), then it's the other things that matter.",1234866644

It doesn't have anything to do with other resources (images or CSS) being loaded or not.

(For the curious, the first programming language with virtual classes was BETA from Aarhus University.) They never made it into UnrealScript. His language research after that time was less incremental and sought to uproot almost everything about programming games. He moved away from object-oriented programming and more towards functional programming, specifically type theory. When I arrived in 2004, he was all about dependently typed languages, the big inspiration being David McAllester's Ontic. For a long time his plan was that his new language would be used to implement most if not at all of UE(n+1). Eventually that ambition had to be tempered by reality and thrown aside; I'm not sure if he's still working on programming language design.",1339199790

The courts there welcome the insanity with open arms.<p>If we could clone Posner and put him in every state, this type of ridiculous patent litigation from IT companies would not be such a viable course of action.<p>Maybe it's not a question of what one justice can do, but a question of people taking a greater interest in their local and federal court systems.  Are the courts in your state giving the go-ahead to frivolous patent proceedings from IT companies?  Do you think that is a good thing?  Is the time and expense for the courts to hear these cases warranted?  Take an interest, as you did with SOPA.  Imagine if there was a calling campaign to state bar associations instead of state politicians.  Believe me, it would get noticed.  Most people just do not care about this stuff enough to take an interest.<p>That said, there are a lot of people who support this patent trolling nonsense.  It doesn't fly in Chicago, but it's par for the course in Washington and California.  Good luck rallying the troops in those places.  Many of them are part of patent trolling machine.

The following, quoted from the article, got me into trouble at a workplace:<p> Employees will try to increase productivity in operations whenever possible.<p>Big no-no when management does not want to learn or is afraid of being left behind. (I ended up cutting half of my work week by retweaking stuff.)<p> Employees will use tools, jigs, and the facility in general in a manner that minimizes wear and maximizes utility and safety.<p>In some of my tweaks I heavily cut down on use of paper and electricity. Also a big no-no for some reason. (Again, mostly because the steps above required learning.)<p> Employees will operate machines and tools in a safe manner at all times.<p>Ever been told to fix something and you don't think it's safe? I go with, ""If it's so safe, why don't you put your hand in there?"" That usually shuts them up and brings them back to a reality where worker safety is a concern.<p> Employees are expected and encouraged to maintain clear and open communication with management about unsafe or inefficient situations in the shop.<p>Attempts at disclosing severe security issues landed a firewall between me and the president. To this day the issue is still not fixed at the branches where I did not work.<p> Employees are expected to keep an accurate time sheet, broken down by job and activity. This time sheet will be used for production metrics as well as for payroll purposes.<p>This is an issue because then they would actually have to pay you for the overtime that you have been working. Ever been told to not include overtime hour work in your reports and only do it orally?<p> Tardiness or absenteeism<p>This is my favourite. A manager would often intercept me at a strategic location where he had arranged a clock to be set fifteen minutes AHEAD and where I would be told I was late.

4086642,comment,4085502,4085502,54,0,grellas,,,"Judge Posner is indeed a brilliant and highly-respected jurist and his views on our problematic patent system will undoubtedly resonate and help the cause of reform. In his courtroom role as such, though, he can have only limited impact on the broader patent debate.<p>The judge entered a tentative ruling saying that he was inclined to dismiss the entire case on the merits with prejudice (meaning, to kill all the claims in the case definitively so they could not be brought again by either party) on grounds that (a) neither party could prove actual damages on their claims, and (b) no good ground existed for the grant of an injunction.<p>These conclusions are well supported on technical grounds by existing law. A damage case can be tossed, once and for all, if a party is conclusively shown not to be able to prove damages, as happened here. And a judge can decline to impose an injunction where the costs of doing so would be far out of proportion to the benefit it gives to the harmed party, where the wrongdoing party is not gaining great benefit from the wrong committed, and where the public would be more damaged than helped by such a remedy.<p>What this really amounts to is a victory for common sense. Where patents involve essentially trivial rights (as often is the case with software patents especially), judges do not like to be used as tools to be manipulated in a broader commercial fight between litigants. In essence, this judge, looking at these facts, said ""OK, kids, time to stop squabbling in the sandbox and go home."" The lesson: pick your fights carefully and don't push claims that are essentially trivial.<p>Judges, good as they are, can only do so much in a system that is defined by constitutional authorization, congressional implementation, and a specialized court set up by Congress that has become cozy with the patent bar. That said, Judge Posner can hardly be accused of being a judge who doesn't respect property rights or IP rights generally and his voice will carry far more impact than most. It will be necessary to have respected voices in the legal community say, ""enough is enough"" many times over before Congress will listen.

I'm a few months ahead of you, and have had some serious ups and downs so far. More free advice for others considering the same:<p>* I don't have savings, so I took a loan amounting to about 3 months of expenses. Having cash in the bank makes me feel a lot better about doing this with a baby on the way. It also means I'm not forced to do low-paid work to make rent. Best case: You pay it all off + early payment fee when you sign your first big deal. Worst case: You get to the end of the runway and have to go back to perm work to pay it off. [1]<p>* It's been said many times but bears repeating: Charge more. Every lead I followed up got a daily rate roughly $200 USD more than the last. I can barely stomach quoting my current rate to clients, but I'm not going to argue with those willing to pay it. [2]<p>* Read about negotiation. <i>Secrets of Power Negotiating</i> for defence, <i>Getting to Yes</i> for doing the actual negotiating. Biggest bit of advice I can give personally is to shut up more often. Never talk the other person into paying you less money when they're perfectly happy paying you more!<p>* Same again for networking: <i>Never Eat Alone</i> is the standard text. If like me you have the social skills of a cave troll, <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> is a good read.<p>* Remember to spend time on your thing. If you're not sure what your thing is, spend time figuring out what your thing should be (still at that stage myself). With networking, chasing client work, planning meetings and then doing client work, it can be difficult to keep this up. Alternatively, once you know what your thing is, Charge More and spend a few weeks at a time (this is my plan and something I've seen others execute successfully).<p>* Have actual, zero-business-value downtime. Pick up a hobby or two if you need to. I chose amateur robotics and catching up on classic SF. It will help you stay sane when things get rough (based on my experience and that of every consultant/freelancer I've spoken to, things will get rough).<p>Good hunting!<p>[1] I'm not a financial advisor, yadda yadda.<p>[2] Another good thing about charging more: clients see you as a <i>consultant</i> rather than <i>additional technical resource</i>.

For instance, I could write code on the Excel team (I don't). I am not a heavy Excel user, so my feelings on how Excel should be set up or operate likely do not represent the actual users of Excel and thus my feedback should be weighted lower than real (paying) customer feedback.

4086598,comment,4080268,4083477,2,0,photon137,,,"First of all, the plot you mention is the projection after the Treasury stimulus - this has absolutely nothing to do with the Fed at all. I have <i>never</i> mentioned the government stimulus at all.<p>I am only describing the factual and operational mechanisms by which the Fed operates - none of which is ""conventional wisdom"". Nowhere have I tried to justify the existence of the Fed.<p>Now since you have brought up the subject of macroeconomics, let me impart some ""conventional wisdom"" to you:<p>It is a ""testable hypothesis"" which has been verified every single time a recession has happened, that the direct cause of a recession is a fall in aggregate demand - and all economists worth their salt ranging from Keynes to Friedman, from Marshall and Samuelson to Karl Marx would agree with that statement.<p>The reasons for fall in aggregate demand could be numerous: war, famine, change in demographics, inflation shocks, credit reduction.<p>A recession caused by a bursting of the credit bubble and the result negative credit shock is known as a ""balance-sheet"" recession where the average consumer has massive liabilities and little equity or high-quality assets left to finance those liabilities. Deleveraging is the natural process by which an economy comes out of such a recession. Lack of credit causes a decrease in puchasing power leading to a decrease in aggregate demand.<p>Now let's examine the Fed's function in all of this:<p>(a) During the credit shock: the Fed acts as the lender-of-last-resort injecting massive liquidity into the system to avoid a systemic catastrophe (to which we came very close in 2008). In 2008, banks stopped lending to each other - corporates had their credit lines closed, commercial-paper issuance went bust. Tell me, if you were a corporate in a capital-intensive business (such as GM, Ford) at that time, even an AAA-rated one, how would you find the money to finance your working capital? That's why avoiding systemic failure of the financial system was important - otherwise few corporates would have survived, let alone banks - leading to colossal unemployment.<p>(b) Post credit shock: So now corporate credit and interbank credit have been restored. But the end-consumer is still highly leveraged - paying interest on loans amidst an increasingly uncertain wage and unemployment backdrop. It is dangerous to provide credit to consumer when the cost of financing that credit is too high. So, the Fed tries to lower the cost of financing by lowering interest rates (to near zero) and by making a market for assets which were pulled out of the financing chain due to the market panic - namely, mortgages. However, do note that there is <i>no</i> net capital creation, the Fed's balance sheet has assets (mortgages, treasuries) and liabilites (cash) in equal amounts.<p>(c) Now the situation becomes murky. The Fed has an accommodative policy but the transmission mechanism is not working. Banks are not lending to consumers. Why? Because the recssion has started and consumer expectations for future purchases have gone down - leading to (i) a decrease in demand for credit and (ii) overall lower sales of goods and services - recession and deleveraging are now in full flow - people are starting to have to learn to live within their means.<p>(d) The Fed, weirdly enough, has a mandate to keep the unemployment-rate ""low"". Here's where I disagree with the fact that the Fed can be effective in achieving this target. Even the Fed thinks that monetary policy alone is too blunt a tool to address unemployment as a whole. Balance sheet recessions cause severe <i>structural</i> dislocations in the labour market limiting worker mobility. These are things that the Fed can't and shouldn't address. Even Milton Friedman concurs [1] (interestingly, Friedman was a great supporter of having a pragmatic monetary policy authority - be it the Fed, a Mickey-Mouse bank, whatever -  to attenuate the variability of the natural business cycle. People invoking Friedman seem to forget that).<p>(e) At this stage, let's look at the chain again: Aggregate Demand <- Consumer Purchasing Power <- Consumer Credit <- Financial Credit. The right side is being taken care of by the monetary policy - but the chain breaks down in the middle. So who steps in from the left side to boost aggregate demand? Voila! -  the government (and its stimulus package).<p>Now, the situation becomes political. The government can (i) do a massive stimulus itself targeting specific sectors it thinks that have structural issues or, (ii) cut taxes giving more purchasing power to the consumer and letting them make the consumption decision. That's all the hoopla is about - nothing more, nothing less. (In general, fiscal stimulus targeting has been done badly by the Obama government [2] )<p>The Fed, as far as the markets are concerned, is an apolitical observer (Bernanke is a Republican but he's the biggest dove on the FOMC!) - it <i>has</i> to be to maintain market stability (to see an example, a single word out of place uttered by a Central Banker can cause massive market rallies or drops - see Mario Draghi's latest ECB press conference).<p>Now, if you have anything useful to contribute which is substantiated by facts and logic, please do so - otherwise do not be vitriolic just because you can be so - that's extremely easy.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf</a>

I read him as saying that the United States has net-positive bilateral migration with almost all countries in the world; i.e. for any given country X, more people are emigrating X->USA than USA->X. That doesn't imply that the U.S. would necessarily be the #1 country in the world for overall immigrants-per-capita, only that it wins most pairwise comparisons of ""voting with your feet"".<p>Secondly, even by your metric, the U.S. is pretty high up. Of the 30 above it on that list, many are microstates, which makes per-capita statistics fairly wonky (some individual American cities would be that high, too, if they counted separately as microstates). And, many aren't even countries at all (e.g. French Guiana, or the Northern Mariana Islands... a 50,000-person U.S. territory). If we ignore those, then things look quite a bit different; the U.S. ends up #15 among independent non-microstates. And a lot of <i>those</i> are places you don't really want to move to if you have a choice, e.g. Burundi ranks highly because of regional wars and refugee camps.

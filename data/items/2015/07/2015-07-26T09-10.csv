9950647,story,,,1,1,franciscop,"Ask HN: How to welcome Technological Unemployment?",,"As a society, being able to produce the same goods with less work is good news. The point where we can produce food for a whole country with 1% of the work required N years ago means that everyone can be fed. Same applies with all other basic resources and most of the advanced ones.<p>However, for the individual this means that &#x27;middle&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; skilled jobs are getting scarce as more and more things get automated. Only highly skilled and technical jobs (most people here probably) with many years of study and dedication are on the rise. Also, a single person working 8-ish hours a day can produce a lot more than 4 people working 2 hours a day so you cannot just make everyone work 10 hours a week. So my question is:<p>How can we grow as a society while making everyone able to take advantage of it?<p>Some notes and why this question is tricky:<p>- No one wants to do work they hate just so other people can take advantage of it. This discards the notion of open source, since most of it is <i>pleasant</i> or is done to scratch your itch.
- Preferably short-middle term, country-independent answers. This discards concepts like Resource Based Economy (highly automated cities) as they are long term.
- Basic income is a nice concept and basically I&#x27;m looking for answers in this fashion, but preferably not basic income on itself (since it&#x27;s also been widely talked about). However I think it gets its good reputation from being seen as a &quot;donation&quot; to the poorer. I am asking more about a fair system within the current society.",1437904701

Now look at &quot;signal&quot; amplitude at the antenna&#x27;s extremities. You&#x27;ll notice that 1/4 wavelength antenna will give you the strongest signal, while 1/2 and full wavelength will apparently give no signal at all. The only reason that full-wavelength piece of wire picks up anything at all are build imperfections - wire length not perfectly matched to wavelength, not perfectly straight, not perfectly aligned with signal source, signal reflections hitting it from different angle, etc. Thats why olympus refers to performance of full-wavelength piece of wire as &quot;random piece of wire&quot;-kind of performance.<p>On the other hand, linear dipole would be 1/2-wavelength (or 2 times 1/4-wavelength), as it is just two 1/4-monopoles put together.",1437904611

The link above is an example of what can happen. By the time you figure it out, perhaps it will be too late. The effects might be local or they might be global, there is no way to predict these things and we can not say with certainty that they don&#x27;t happen, because we have more than one example of where they do. In fact human intelligence may be an accident of horizontal gene transfer. These are not games that are worth playing in my opinion. You are what you eat. If that stuff it in your food supply, it just might end up in you and the bacteria and other life that lives in you.<p>Another really big problem is dependence. Once you come to depend on these things, just like we are now with carbon producing technology, you can not pull the plug. Even if you know that it&#x27;s causing harm, the social mechanism needed to pull the plug don&#x27;t exist in free society and if they do they are very slow moving.

You may have fancy diagnostic computers and automated scalpels, but you are going to want a doctor somewhere. A NLP algo might be faster, more accurate, and better at recalling old cases than a judge, but you&#x27;re not going to be satisfied in a society where you open a website to find out whether you&#x27;re going to jail.<p>- Jobs where interacting with a human is the whole point. There are things where humans are baked in.<p>- The oldest profession is not going to be replaced with robots until those robots are mistakable for humans, as in Blade Runner. Therapists and hairdressers are probably safe, too.<p>- Watch any major sport. They talk about where the players grew up, what kind of mentality you need to succeed, etc. You show up at the stadium to watch gladiators, not robots. You exercise your tribal nature by buying the jersey and screaming like an idiot. You want to see John Terry crying after missing the penalty.

The risk of the <i>current</i> crop of engineered plants becoming super-weeds that choke the planet is not zero, but also not plausible from a biological perspective.<p>That someone <i>could</i> engineer a super weed is of course possible, as would be engineering the flu virus to produce cholera toxin.

As soon as your processor has a MMU there is neither any &quot;hack&quot; involved nor do you pay any performance penalty.<p>And if your app really needs more than 4GB of memory it might be sensible to fork() anyways since unix processes are dirt cheap. It also plays well with modern multicore architectures since it forces you to parallelize your problem.<p>The single most important performance issue we have today is really memory bandwidth and access time. If you carry 64 bit pointers around all the time you need roughly 30% percent more memory which is wasted on precious cache. So you have to either live with even more cache misses or you have to increase the cache size. And since cache is one of the major power and chip area consumer in todays processors increasing the cache is expensive in many ways.",1437901476

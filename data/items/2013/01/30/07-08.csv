His sympathy was immediate, and separately from that, an obituary or other certificate would set the incomplete/rescheduling machinery in motion.

5138566,comment,5131486,5132701,2,0,VeejayRampay,,,"Well, here's what I think: France had a religious rift in the past due to horrible religious wars, our brand of Christianism is mostly catholic as a result.<p>Self-determination and the myth of pre-disposition are core values of protestantism which largely influenced the way Anglo-Saxon societies approach self-enterprise and self-reliance in general. Luther was quite insistent that each individual should have direct relation to God through scripture, which promotes the idea that one gets to decide things for oneself and should not rely on middlemen. Protestantism also doesn't promote self-castigation as much as catholicism, which creates an atmosphere where people are actually encouraged to acquire wealth, thrive as entrepreneurs, etc.<p>In France on the other hand, our culture, due to the aforementioned mostly Catholic culture, success and the amassing of riches is seen as something you should not boast about and almost repent for.<p>I'm talking general religious influences on the collective unconscious of a nation as a whole here, particular cases might of course be much less coarse in their specifics. The other very important difference is the fact that France has traditionally tried to preserve a strong social safety net and government involvement in most matters (education, transportation, health care, roads, investment in research, major companies, national defense, etc) is still strong and has wide support among the population, which as you know means that everyone and businesses in particular have an obligation to give back to society as they grow (through high taxes), to ensure that we can then try our best to share the benefits with everyone for the greater good.<p>As a result of all this, there is much less of an incentive for self-entrepreneurship and much less possibilities for the likes of Google, Facebook, Enron or other American business behemoths to emerge, which creates an atmosphere where the emphasis on business is not as strong as it is in the States. We don't have channels as big as Bloomberg or other 24/7 stock market channels here, we don't know the ins and outs of lemonade stands at age 8, we don't read about trading theories, MBAs are not as big, etc.<p>TL;DR: The emphasis on business and self-entrepreneurship in particular is not as big in France as it is in most ""Protestant"" societies because we favor a model where everyone is in a mediocre middle rather than having people going through the roof and others down the gutter. Different approaches and I don't reckon either to be inherently superior to the other, they're just, well, different approaches.",1359532448

This second change  probably didn't feel as great as the first one, although it registered as kind of being nice.<p>Fast forward to 2012 and $140k of income - I honestly couldn't care less. Although it wasn't linear increase in after-tax money, yet still it was rather significant. Did it feel good? Barely.  I have a blog post [2] that somewhat touches on that.<p>What's more important for me now? Being owner of my time and how I spend it. Money?

Ideally, better algorithms and efficient data structures could be chosen at the design stage to create a more optimized solution. But does this approach always work?<p>In my experience, it often fails in a greenfield implementation. The reason being the lack of understanding of the real performance bottlenecks. This is usually revealed only after several iterations of profiling and optimizing code (often revealing least expected spots).<p>But if it's fairly well known problem say relative ranking of a set of hyperlinked documents, there is a lot of opportunity to study existing literature and come up with a more efficient algorithm. Even then, once the initial implementation is built, the task of making ""a slow system faster"" needs to be done and often a never ending process.<p>So the conundrum is not often the need for speed being an primary criteria but on lack of familiarity with the performance bottlenecks eliminate them from the design stage itself.",1359530409

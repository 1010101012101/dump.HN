Anyway, I wanted to learn how to program.  I took a C class at a local university.  I remember, vividly, being so frustrated that I was in tears when trying to learn about pointers and recursive functions.  Very basic to me now, but at the time, extremely frustrating - I simply didn't understand the concepts.  I reached out to a few of the developers at that company and they helped me.  I'm not a stud programmer, not by any stretch of the imagination, but I've made a good living over the years - and I have not once programmed in C since that class.  BUT --- the things I learned in that class have helped me tremendously.  For example, it helped me when I was programming in VB and needed to tap into raw winapi functions.  A combination of C programming basics, along with OS basics, will get you a LONG way when trying to understand and solve challenges you'll come across in ""normal"" programming challenges.",1320641672

3205044,comment,3202661,3204688,5,0,stuntprogrammer,,,"Hmm, I think it depends on what ""meaningful"" means. I don't mean to break out the Clintonisms but it depends on what you are looking for. I've worked in hardware product firms, software product firms, and trading firms.<p>Is it ""meaningful"" to spend my days figuring out ways to get more people to click on more adverts? Not really. Build a social network for dogs' left testicles? Not really. Squeeze another dollar out of the equity markets? Not really. Build a faster database? Build a web analytics tool so people can squeeze out a few more conversions? Take a few cycles out of a market data feed handler to lower latency for a trading algorithm? No, no, and nope.<p>Are there good side effects from the above? Sure, we can come up with examples. For finance, you can take a look at the tightening of spreads (e.g. hft tends to make spreads go to their minimum making trades cheaper for everyone). Or adding liquidity in regular conditions so when someone small like  a retail user comes along to sell some stock they get a good price quickly (not always of course, I mean really, you expect smart teams to take obviously dumb trades in an illiquid market?). Or more rapid price discovery (i.e. if something is mispriced it tends to get arb'ed away pretty rapidly, so that is faster info dissemination).<p>Can it be fun? Sure. Is it more good for the world than bad? Yup, I think so. Is it /meaningful/? Is it bollocks.<p>None of the above is meaningful compared to other things in my life. Important things like my family and trying to leave the world a better place than I found it (e.g. I give to charity -- probably more than most will ever earn).<p>That, and I'm with Vonnegut.

You take it to the front and get your ten drives.   Not anymore.  Now they actually limit you to the limit.<p>I was able to buy enough 2tb RE4 drives to hopefully carry me through the end of the year.<p>The other thing I did right away was test my stash of used and questionable drives, and return the bad ones.  That's another 10 or 15 drives right there, The testing took a period of days (and I returned bad drives as I found them)  - the replacements are trickling back, and it looks like all of them, at this point, are in the mail.  But if this behavior was common, e.g. people that had large stashes of broken drives laying about that they returned all at once when news of the shortage hit?  I can only imagine that the stresses on their stock for warranty returns are making the problem worse.<p>Oh, also note, I have some 3tb, 7200rpm 'consumer grade' drives (hatachi and seagate)  new, sealed, that I bought for a storage project that is suddenly looking not as realistic.  I'd be willing to trade them for 'enterprise' drives of smaller capacities;  contact me if you have 500g 'raid edition' drives or similar and want to trade.",1320641551

On the one hand, (speaking as one who comes from a family of farmers) - they are amazingly early adopters of technology - to a degree that I think might shock your average denzien of HN.  DGPS, Real-Time weather reports feeding into Options Plays on their Crops (I learned more about calls, puts, and commodities markets in one evening around a campfire in banff, than 2 years of economics classes and endless surfing of thestreet.com ever taught me), chemical systems for fertilizers, satellite displays on the hydration levels of their fields - these are all fairly common tools of your farmer that has more than four or five sections.<p>But what they lack is capital, scale, vertical integration, and access to enterprise IT systems.<p>The first casualties of technological advances were the manual laborers, but, as technology advances, and automation evolves further,  the ""independent farmer"" will cease to exist in North America outside of the smaller retirement/sustenance farms (that are numerous, but don't contribute that greatly to the food supply) and niche areas that supply ""Organically Grown"", ""Locally harvested"" markets.<p>The Very Large Farms (that is, those farms doing > $500K sales/year) will continue to grow as a percentage of total farms, and those will increasingly become larger, and, as a result, eliminate farming jobs.<p>Farmers are stubborn, and resilient, so it won't happen quickly - but as those farms are lost to the mega-agricorps, they won't come back into the family.  Average age of a farmer in the United States is around 57 - so, in about 10 years from now, as we see wider deployment of automated vehicles, yet another segment of the american job market will begin its permanent decline.",1320641186

But pointer tricks have no place outside of low-level systems programming (OS kernels and language runtimes), and as little of that as possible to bootstrap something more comfortable.<p>I work on BITS (<a href=""http://biosbits.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biosbits.org/</a>), a project based on GRUB for doing BIOS testing.  It has a pile of low-level C code to interface with hardware and system facilities, as well as other existing C interfaces like ACPICA; however, a while ago we ported the Python runtime, and since then we've ported more and more of the functionality to Python scripts.<p>Python doesn't have static typing, but it does handle memory management and object lifetimes automatically.  It represents a good balance of high-level safety and comfort, acceptance by the target audience, and ease of porting to a freestanding environment with no OS support.

(BTW, landline phones are more expensive. They are the luxury now.) That was grandparent's point, and I do not believe you've presented a convincing argument against it.",1320639025

3204943,comment,3204159,3204444,4,0,_delirium,,,"There hasn't been quite the flexibility and utter non-dependence on material livelihood that techno-utopians predicted, though. By some estimates, we've had something like a 50x productivity improvement during the 20th century. If you assume that in 1900 the average person was a subsistence farmer (a conservative assumption), spending 100% of their time to earn basic shelter and 2000 calories/day, then with 50x productivity improvement, someone should be able to get basic, 1900-style food/shelter by working only 2% of a full-time job, i.e. almost negligible work, only a few days a year. Hence the widespread predictions made by early-20th-c authors that by 2000, basic needs (shelter/food) would be essentially free.<p>But obviously that hasn't happened: there is no real route by which I can put in 2% of full-time work, which by productivity gains is supposedly equivalent to 100% of 1900's full-time work, and live a basic 1900-era lifestyle. If there were, a lot of homeless people would take that option, working one week a year and earning themselves basic 1900-era accommodations/food.<p>It's just not an option you can actually pursue. Heck, even if you want to take some of the productivity gains in quality improvements: let's admit you don't have the option today to live like a 1900-era citizen, but <i>have</i> to, at a minimum, live 10x better. Then I should still be able to live <i>ten times as well</i> as the average 1900 citizen while putting in only 20% of a full-time job's worth of labor, thanks to that 50x productivity improvement. But that isn't really an option, either. Instead it seems that, if that 50x figure is indeed real, the only way to realize it is to take the dividend as material wealth, living 50x better rather than putting in less labor.",1320638880

If I teach my students about X I will test them on X (either through extended pieces of work or through tests and exams) and not Y.<p>The trouble with many texts is that they aren't tailored to any particular course (mainly I imagine because courses vary so greatly even within countries). This is why it's really great to see lots of resources like Khan Acadamy out there where things are more focused on concepts rather than courses and you can pick and choose what you need to learn about.<p>One of the problems with teaching that I've seen since I started is that many people produce their own sets of resources, but there's very little sharing going on when you consider the total population. Considering the networks of really knowledgable people out there, we really don't need textbooks; we just need smart people willing to collaborate more and the technology to make that accessible.<p>Edit: With some afterthought, some of this is probably a systemic problem with the bureauracy which has large scale contracts with publishers and so on, and thus little interest in using the resource they already have (ie their teachers).<p>When implementing some new courses here in Westeran Australia the department of education implemented groups of teachers to produce sample material, but it wasn't particularly well funded or promoted nearly well enough to make it very successful, and it was only accessible to other government schools and not independent and religious schools (Catholic, Anglican systems etc). It would have been nice (and completely surprising) for the systems to work together or set up an independent body to manage something like this.",1320638683

There are times when recursive queries are helpful from a performance perspective, but I don't see a good way to index, for example, path to a node.  Certainly most databases don't do this well enough to be ideal for hierarchical directories.

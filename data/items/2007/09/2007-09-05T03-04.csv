I am now ready to give producing an income a shot again and I am pretty sure I will make it this time around.",1188964627

50318,comment,50303,50303,0,0,dood,,,"The problem is that the demand for desirable names is vastly higher than ever before, while the supply is limited [1]. Moreover, since there are now so many named things competing for attention, finding a name that stands out and is desirable is pretty hard.<p>1. Interestingly, the market adaptation has been a slow erosion of the constraints on desirable names - 'Yahoo' and 'Google' sounded silly once upon a time, as did 'Flickr'. As the number of web apps increases, chances are the wackyness of the names, and people's tolerance for them will continue to expand.<p>This probably bothers those in the biz far more than most people, since they see dozens of these things a day while normal users only see those few apps they use or stumble upon. Though a lot of the names of the also-rans and almost-rans are truely terrible.<p>",1188962795

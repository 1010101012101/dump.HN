1460590,comment,1459728,1460175,0,0,llimllib,,,"You appear to have your facts wrong. From the study[1]:<p>> Eligible cases were all patients with a glioma or meningioma of the brain diagnosed in the study regions during study periods of 2–4 years between 2000 and 2004.<p>So participants in the study lasted between 2 and 4 years. Since elevated rates of cancer were only found in the group with the highest usage[2], this means people with >=1640 hours of talk time, which means between 68 and 34 hours <i>per month</i>.<p>Not two hours per month. And this is easy to sanity check; here's the study again:<p>> Corresponding values for [<i>median lifetime cumulative call time</i>] glioma controls were 100 h lifetime, 2.5 h/month and about 2000 calls.<p>So the <i>median</i> user used about 2.5 hours per month, not the heavy user.<p>Now, let's hear them out a bit more:<p>> Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with use of mobile phones. There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma at the highest exposure levels, but biases and error prevent a causal interpretation. The possible effects of long-term 
heavy use of mobile phones require further investigation.<p>It's also worth noting that you're using the word <i>double</i> somewhat duplicitously. Yes, the study found <i>double</i> the glioma rate in very heavy users (as discussed, much more than two hours per month), but it also found that the rest of cellphone users are less likely to get cancer than average.<p>If we take your causal analysis seriously, then we should also take this seriously: low to moderate cell phone usage grants instant partial immunity to brain cancer.<p>So, because the cancer rate in the study population excluding the highest usage group was .7 of what it is in the normal population, a rate of 1.4 times the normal population among heavy users is <i>double</i> the rate seen in the rest of the study population.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/ije/press_releases/freepdf/dyq079.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/ije/press_release...</a>

As the article stated, not too long ago you where looking at a $20-$100k budget to just get a good web presence of the ground.

You get a screen that shows the amount you have to pay, you verify this<p>5. You get an SMS with a code that you have to enter<p>6. Purchase completed<p>The nice thing about this is that it's very quick and the seller doesn't get your credit card number; steps 2-6 happen on your bank's website. And there is no intermediary: it's just the seller's bank and your bank. There is nothing to set up, you just have to have a bank that supports it (almost all banks in the netherlands do) The nice thing for sellers is that chargebacks are not possible. This is a much saner way to do online payments.",1277468088

1460529,comment,1460087,1460267,0,0,jakevoytko,,,"Sleep(1) is <i>very</i> noisy on Windows machines. The time slice given by default is ~15-20ms [1], and calling Sleep(<15) relinquishes the rest of the time slice. Windows has a multimedia API that can be used to get intervals down to 1ms, but it requires system calls that increase your system load. So you usually just need to use proper synchronization anyways, which is what the Python guys should have done :)<p>This crummy Sleep() implementation has some nice effects on programmers. Those who like to solve problems with lots of copy/paste code are forced to think about using proper synchronization primitives when running high resolution loops that wait for events, or their code just won't run very fast.<p>[1] <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/clr/thread/facc2b57-9a27-4049-bb32-ef093fbf4c29/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/clr/thread/fac...</a>",1277468053

The people I tell about this arrangement usually say they would love to the free time but could not afford to earn less. Some would not mind reducing their expenses but are afraid to ask their boss because it could hurt their career prospects. In most jobs the idea of working part-time is unusual, does not bring direct benefits to the employer, and requires some coordination effort, so why would they do it? The one big upside for the company is the employee's higher motivation, but unfortunately this is not easily quantifiable. I was lucky to be hired by a director who was also an artist wishing he had more time to paint.<p>During the dotcom boom I had an interview with a software company founded by students where many programmers worked 60%. They had some coordination problems. The company went down in the dotcom bust. My previous job was with a company where everybody worked 4 days a week. They wouldn't let me work 3 days after they had tried it with one employee and were not satisfied with the results. Before I worked 3 days a week as an economist and it went pretty well.<p>There are other jobs where part-time is more usual or even the norm. Many artists become part-time teachers.",1277467848

There is a bias for frustration. At the Apple Store, one has to make an ""appointment"", for the privileged of bringing forth your issue to a person with the corporate title of ""Genius"". People are less inclined to talk down to people who are important and smart.<p>In fairness to the Genius Bar, their standards for customer relations are higher than the typical support org.

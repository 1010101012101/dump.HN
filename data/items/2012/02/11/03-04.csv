3578534,comment,3577936,3577936,1,0,kls,,,"I am always fascinated by why people get so caught up in titles or no-titles. The reality is if it is a good team titles are not going to go to their head, they know it is just a title. Further titles help when dealing with third parties that are concerned with titles. I can't tell you how many times I have seen a consultant or a third party provider talk past the ""tech guy"" to the CEO because the ""tech guy"" does not have a title. Worse yet I have seen them undermine their authority, because they perceive them as having no power. I swear we do it to ourselves in this industry, when everybody has no title then the cool guys will all be giving themselves titles and titles will be all the rage. If you are the guy that calls the shots you are the CEO plain and simple, having that title simplifies things and brings clarity. If you run the technology you are the CTO again this is simple and brings clarity. It does not matter if you are two guys starting out or a 5000 person company, titles help simplify understanding. If someone is so pretentious that a title changes how they work, then you don't want them around, it does not matter if there title is CEO or secretary.",1328932709

That being said, by your post I can tell that that is not where you want to be. A lot of people will say just use what you know, but ignoring trends does not make them go away. There is a reality and that reality is there is a lot of cool problems that are being solved and that work is not happening in Java. There are cool problems being solved in Java don't get me wrong, but what you you are looking for, is easier found in other language cultures. It is a reality whether we like it or not. That being said there are ways to leverage your Java knowledge and still move towards that culture. Specifically there are two languages that utilize the JVM and the existing Java libs they are Scala and Clojure. I recently made the full switch over to Clojure because I want to work on something else, and it has been a great experience. While it is not as popular as Ruby, the work available for the market it some of the most impressive projects I have seen. This was a big factor in my choosing it as a technology to invest my time in and it is a very valid reason to do so. Anyways point being yes you should absolutely learn Ruby if the market seems to be solving problems that you want to work on, but in saying that there are some other really cool languages out there running on-top of the JVM that some interesting work is available for, if you just want to get into interesting work, you might want to take a minute to investigate the others because your experience with the JVM and Java libs will give you a head start in moving over to them.",1328932137

I'm certain you could create some sort of shell or wrapper script that will handle the pretty printing. If I understand you right, you could feed the MathCAD input into the wrapper which prints the appropriate source expressions, and then translates and runs your MathCAD into Python for evaluation. Does that help?<p>2) Short answer, yes. However, you should expect a certain amount of error in your readings and then you'd need some way to resolve the constants in your double integration. If you had some initial bearing, that might suffice if you have two simultaneously captured samples to feed in for the two constants.<p>I assume you want only accelerometers and want to avoid an external source for capturing your bearing. It would take a clever solution to decipher your bearing without some external source, but I'm not willing to say it can't be done. If you can't find a way and end up with some sort of external source/reference for bearing, you might as well use dead-reckoning to determine your position.<p>4-6 accelerometers in realtime? If you just processing raw data, I think you could find a way to do it onboard in quasi-realtime (important to note that the arduino is not a realtime device and this could skew your results as well). However, you'll probably want to do some processing on the data to get a normalized sample for integration.<p>Yes, you could easily transmit the data to a PC OR save it to some external storage for realtime processing. Lots of modules available which provides that functionality (bluetooth, xbee, x10, wifi).<p>Hope this helps.",1328931103

3578469,comment,3577454,3578354,1,0,csallen,,,"Thanks for responding.<p><pre><code>  Fairness/cheating\n</code></pre>\nWhat about the open source movement? I code using a lot of free technology. Rather than implying the tech is of no value, I think the fact that I (and millions of others) use it is a <i>testament</i> to its value. We hold the creators in high regard. The stated purpose of copyright law in the Constitution is to ""promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"". If anything, invoking copyright law for nothing other than personal financial gain is immoral.<p><pre><code>  Authority/subversion\n</code></pre>\nI may be misinterpreting your point here, but I have no problem with paying artists indirectly through representatives. If they want to enter into a contract, that's their right.<p><pre><code>  Liberty/oppression\n</code></pre>\nMy neighbor buys a book from Borders, reads it, and gives it to me. At this point, I'm entering into a transaction with my neighbor, <i>not</i> with the author of the book, and <i>not</i> with Borders. This is perfectly legal behavior in accordance to the doctrine of first sale, which prevents owners from retaining control over copyrighted material after it's been bought. This is also a very moral doctrine, in my opinion, because it's excessively greedy to try to maintain control over something even after you've sold it.<p>Where the confusion comes into play is with digital goods. Digital goods are MUCH easier to manipulate (copy, trade, give, etc) than physical goods. Theoretically, ONE person can buy a CD, then make it available to everyone else on earth in a matter of minutes. This destroys business models that worked with physical goods, but I would argue that destroying business models is not immoral in a capitalist society. We don't condemn Henry Ford for ruining the businesses of horse-and-wagon sellers.<p>The stated purpose of copyright law in the Constitution is to ""promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"". If anything, invoking copyright law for nothing other than personal financial gain is immoral. Instead, the law should be used to stop those who would hinder scientific and artistic progress; for example, by creating knockoffs and masquerading them as the original, thus preventing the original creators from ever reaping rewards.<p>File-sharing does indeed make some forms of art a lot less profitable than they <i>could</i> be. And you may be tempted to argue that this equates to hindering progress. However, I'd respond by pointing out that profit is not the same as progress. There is no evidence to suggest that art has stopped progressing due to file-sharing. If anything, it's only gotten better in the last 10 years.<p><pre><code>  Sanctity/degradation\n</code></pre>\nHaha, well I wouldn't agree that it's immoral to modify art or music. In fact, that's kind of the purpose. It's about expression, speech, creativity, and the flow of ideas. This behavior is explicitly allowed by the fair use doctrine.",1328930238

3578459,comment,3575612,3575612,18,0,unoti,,,"Related to this is the no-complaining bracelet challenge, which I think has been mentioned here before.  I've been doing this challenge, and finding it life-changing.  The idea is to wear a bracelet, and never complain.  If you complain, you must change the bracelet to the other arm.  The goal is to go for 30 days straight without complaining.  Its surprisingly hard to do.  At first I thought it was stupid, because its what going on inside your brain that counts, and not giving it voice surely wouldnt make any difference.  But I found that it makes a huge difference.  The act of not complaining, never complaining, retrains your brain to think about what you truly are in control of, and what you are not in control of.  It helps translate hardship into either actively making the situation better, or not thinking about it.  Thats really all anyone can ever do, but having the option to complain makes that a lot cloudier.  Going the full 30 days without complaining, Ive learned, cannot be done without totally retraining the mind to see life differently.  I heartily recommend it to anyone.<p>Keeping a journal about when I complain taught me someone very important about myself that has also helped me cope and not get overwhelmed.  The times that I complained, I discovered, tended to be when I hadnt had enough sleep or food.  Ive structured my life around making sure that I get plenty of sleep, and that I eat regularly.<p>Training myself not to complain has really helped me not get overwhelmed and reduced my stress quite a bit.",1328929853

Then on thursday Jack Dorsey came to speak, and told everyone about a point early in Square's history when they ran up against what appeared to be a brick wall.  Then he paused, during which everyone wondered what ingenious solution he had come up with, and continued ""so I called up Ron Conway,"" and the whole room burst into laughter.<p>I advise every startup that wants to make it really big to get Ron as an investor.

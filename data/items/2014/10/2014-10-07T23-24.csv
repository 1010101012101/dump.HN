This is the biggest problem with the whole static/dynamic debate.<p>Until there are studies that clearly demonstrate that projects written in statically typed languages have statistically less defects, are developed faster, or are easier to maintain, it&#x27;s all anecdotal evidence.<p>There are tons of large real world projects developed in both static and dynamic languages, there&#x27;s very little indication that projects developed in dynamic languages have significantly more defects or that they&#x27;re more difficult to maintain.<p>In fact, some of the largest and most robust applications are written in Erlang.

8424637,comment,8421594,8424426,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"You don&#x27;t need to go all the way to IO, you can make every function total using Partial:<p><pre><code>    data Partial a = Now a | Later (Partial a)
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s straightforward to do things in Partial, since it&#x27;s a Functor, Applicative and Monad:<p><pre><code>    instance Functor Partial where
        fmap f (Now x) = Now (f x)
        fmap f (Later x) = Later (fmap f x)

    instance Applicative Partial where
        pure x = Now x
        (Now f) <*> (Now x) = Now (f x)
        (Later f) <*> x = Later (f <*> x)
        f <*> (Later x) = Later (f <*> x)

    instance Monad Partial where
        return = pure
        f >>= (Now x) = f x
        f >>= (Later x) = Later (f x)
</code></pre>
Partial is so trivial that everything can be made co-recursive by wrapping all function bodies in &quot;Later&quot;. All of the &quot;Later&quot; wrappers will get nested together by the Applicative/Monad; everything will &quot;just work&quot;. The one missing piece is the following function, which isn&#x27;t total:<p><pre><code>    runPartial :: Partial a -> a
    runPartial (Now x) = x
    runPartial (Later x) = runPartial x
</code></pre>
We could name it `unsafeForcePartial` and treat it with care, like we currently do with `unsafePerformIO`.",1412725941

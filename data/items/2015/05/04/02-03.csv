9484056,comment,9481074,9481976,0,0,sjolsen,,,"Other differences between message passing and function calls aside, I disagree with this characterization. While many mainstream languages perform static binding of functions, it is <i>not</i> an inherent feature of functions (at least as I personally have come to understand them); the canonical example is Common Lisp&#x27;s generic functions, which behave in almost exactly the way you describe message passing.<p>I think no small part of the disagreements in this thread can be attributed to people simply having different notions of what phrases like &quot;function call&quot; mean, with some envisioning invoking a statically resolved, monotyped C-style subroutine, and others a more abstract notion of issuing a command to perform a computation with an understood set of semantics on a provided collection of data. The latter is what I think of a function as in a computational context, and from what I&#x27;ve gathered from the other comments here, a fair approximation of what is typically meant by &quot;message passing.&quot;<p>Now, there&#x27;s something to be said for differences like the treatment of synchronization and process boundaries, but I&#x27;m inclined to categorize those as the same sort of pragmatic-but-technically-untrue distinctions as that between so-called &quot;compiled languages&quot; and &quot;interpreted languages.&quot; Certainly there is at the very least an isomorphism to be established between the two conventions, given access to threads, promises, and some form of IPC.",1430707852

For starters, the catholic church is shock-full of polytheistic symbols, and there is little evidence that it was different during the Roman empire. They follow eucharistic rituals that were common to other religions, such as the cult of Dionysius. The main difference between christianity and paganism is the replacement of the greco-roman gods with the judeo-christan pantheon (YAHWEH, his son, angels, archangels, satan, the virgin Mary) and the idea that only one divine entity should be called &quot;god&quot;.",1430707674

This is typical for most enterprises that really aren&#x27;t in the software business as a legit line of business. So it&#x27;s pretty much only possible to just pay a vendor and deal with all the BS of having to learn another party&#x27;s software while having the downsides of procurement and politics in big companies.<p>The throat to choke argument is not sufficient anymore for a lot of enterprises though because they are sick of their vendors giving poor results or ones not aligned to their own goals in the product lines. I haven&#x27;t exactly heard of anyone getting actually sued, but you can make a little money back sometimes if a vendor doesn&#x27;t meet their SLA.<p>I started advocating mostly open source solutions partly because using vendors is like taking drugs and eventually they&#x27;ll start dictating your architecture rather than you pick your architecture, which is likely to conflict with a competing vendor&#x27;s architecture. All of this talking and demoing is also costly, but these type of evaluators are fairly easy to find compared to talented / competent developers.<p>But really, companies that already have solid lines of business that can only grow a bit are far more concerned about loss of revenue than trying to grow n% faster in most parts of the company.",1430707533

You would know that there&#x27;s a floating point unit with divider, but didn&#x27;t know how to access it, or how to set the register for the division, or even which OPCODE you should use to set it up.<p>Moreover, the only compiler would be the one send to you by Intel, and the whole compilation process is also pretty much undocumented.

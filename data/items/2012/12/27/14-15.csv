But probably you're not planning on being a 20 person company forever, and the more people, the harder it is to change things.<p>As for vacation, why not - you get 2 weeks vacation as a signing bonus, plus 3 weeks/year. This accrues up to X months. Seems to solve all of the problems. If you want to stick with the no vacation policy, assuming you're the founder, it means that you have to take long, extended vacations. If you want your employees to be comfortable taking two weeks off, you have to take two weeks off and make people know that you're taking two weeks off (and not work those two weeks, at least as far as people can tell). There are always deadlines, always important meetings, and I find it impossible to justify taking an arbitrary amount of time off with no guideline. The point of vacation time isn't trust, it's to set that guideline - I am here to work, but I need to know what the expectations are. You can deal with the outliers as they come up - if one of your good employees wants to take two months off in the summer, you guys'll work something out.<p>Then I think having no sick day policy (""come to work sick and you're fired"") and a flexible work from home policy makes this less about beancounting and more about taking time off to energize. Everyone loses a few days a year to appointments, a cold, a sleepless night, etc., and hates having to take those out of their vacation days (or are forced to lie about being sick).",1356620016

In that world view you don't ask if something responds to a selector but rather whether it's an instance of a suitable interface. There are still occasions when responsa to/perform is a nice pattern but its often better done with lambdas. Perform also tends to need annoying special casing to optimise.<p>The exception I'd make to that is meta-programmingespecially for ORM librarieswhere responds to, perform, and lambdas together produce some lovely patterns to marry a schematic to a dynamically generated object hierarchy.",1356619059

How long it takes your application to issue a successful response?<p>2) Network Speed. A server response for a 500MB file is fast, but downloading it isn't<p>3) DOM Processing. Great, you've reached the user's browser, now how long does it take the page to load into the DOM<p>4) Page Rendering. Only done after all the ""assets"" are downloaded. This is <i>usually</i> the final state of the page.<p>Yes, if your Google Page Speed number is super high, you've got a problem.

4973366,comment,4969372,4972603,1,0,betterunix,,,"""If you unwind the stack after the catch block, the lock_guard destructor inside of lock_and_throw() gets executed after the mutex has already been deleted. So either the mutex_wrapper constructor can't delete m_ptr from the catch block (and then where is it supposed to do it when it wants to re-throw the exception?) or lock_and_throw can't assume that an otherwise valid argument passed to it won't be deleted out from under its stack variables' destructors whenever any exception is thrown.""<p>That sounds like the sort of memory management problem that smart pointers are supposed to solve.  It looks like a smart pointer would be exactly the sort of thing you would want here:  when and if the stack is ultimately unwound, the lock_guard object will be destroyed first, then the smart pointer (because unwinding a constructor will cause the destructors of member objects to be invoked; note that your code throws the exception out of the constructor, and so the stack would have to be unwound at a higher level catch).  The problem is not with unwinding the stack at the end of the catch block (which would not even be reached in your example, because of the throw in the catch block); the problem is that you explicitly deleted the pointer before the stack would have been unwound.<p>""And if you run the catch block and then go back and unwind the stack, it still leaves the question of what happens when a destructor throws during stack unwinding. Do you call the same catch block again (and then have to check for possible double free etc.), or do you let an exception that was surrounded by catch() escape out to the calling function just because it was already called once? Neither seems pleasant.""<p>Really?  It sounds like the second option would be what you would want:  if the stack was unwound implicitly after the body of the catch block had executed, and unwinding the stack caused an exception to be thrown, then the exception was thrown out of the catch block.  How is that unpleasant?<p>""The conclusion should be instead that global variables shouldn't be instantiated using constructors that throw exceptions unless program termination is the desired result when such an exception occurs -- which it actually is in most cases, because having uninitialized global variables floating around is unwise to say the least.""<p>Except that a failure to initialize should at least be reported to the user.  Maybe you could not get a network connection, or you could not allocate memory, or there is a missing file -- whatever it is, the user should know, and the thrower of the exception should not be responsible for telling the user.  If you have restarts, you get something better -- you get the chance to try the operation again, which might be good if you have a long start-up process.<p>""Also, if it should ever become an actual problem in a specific instance, there is always the possibility of initializing the object with a different, non-throwing constructor and then having main reinitialize it on startup and catch any exceptions.""<p>In other words, all classes should provide a non-throwing constructor and an initialization routine, because any object might be constructed in the global scope.<p>""There are obviously some applications that require arbitrary precision. But most applications never need to count as high as 2,305,843,009,213,693,952.""<p>It is not just about counting high.  If an application adds or multiplies two numbers, there is a chance of an overflow.  If the application is reading one of the operands from the user, that overflow could be a security problem -- such problems are frequently reported.<p>""So why pay for it constantly if you so rarely need it?""<p>You don't have to pay for it constantly; you can have fixed-width types as something the programmer explicitly requests, or as something the compiler generates as an optimization.  The real question is, why should the default type be the least safe, and why should programmers have to work harder to get a natural and safe abstraction?<p>""who says the compiler can't optimize out the arbitrary precision library calls in cases where the values are known at compile time just because the library isn't an official part of the language? The calls are likely to be short enough to be inlined and then if all the values are static the optimizer has a good shot at figuring it out.""<p>Can you name a C++ compiler that does this?<p>""String literals as const char arrays are mostly harmless because the compiler ensures that they're ""right"" -- if they're const then you can't accidentally go writing past the end because you can't accidentally write at all""<p>You can accidentally read past the end, and you can accidentally print what you read.  That can cause a lot of problems.  There is no requirement that people use the standard library to iterate through a string.<p>""Moreover, bounds checking is pretty easy if you want it""<p>Once again, the programmer has to do extra work just to get something safe, because the default semantics are unsafe.  If bounds checking is so easy, why not make it the default, and have unchecked access be an option for cases where speed matters?  You already have at() and operator[] -- all that is needed is to switch which one of those does the bounds check.",1356617979

My wife thought that personal training would get her motivated to lose weight and get in shape. Unfortunately the trainer was a complete jerk. He was inconsistent with making his appointments, to his credit though, he must have the unluckiest family ever because just about ever Saturday was a ""family emergency"" <i>eye roll</i>. But anyway, since he wasn't consistent with showing up and he didn't do much except count and look at his phone, my wife wasn't getting results. That's when he suggested taking weight loss pills. Actually he didn't suggest, he kept pushing them on her. She actually thought about it (to which I convinced her it isn't a good idea). There has been one good trainer at that place since then but he left for a better job (go figure).<p>I feel that if you go a big box gym, you are walking in to a personal trainer revolving door and that the trainers are sales people in disguise.

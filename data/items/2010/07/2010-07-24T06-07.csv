I guess it is better to use one of Scala/Groovy/Clojure languages.<p>The question is: which of them is better for desktop GUI programming? My program will transform and display a series of jpeg/png files + there will be ~10 dialogs (with tons of options in each with all possible widgets).<p>The main requirement is compactness: I <i>hate</i> to write a dozen lines of code only to draw a simple frame with a button. My background in GUI is (mostly) Tcl/Tk and GTK+.<p>Thanks in advance.",1279951453

And while that maybe be true, you also have to realize that governments would much rather prefer people stay in real hotels regardless of what the hotel industry thinks. Local governments get a lot of money off of occupancy taxes, as well as tax off of the employment of those in the service industries. How many airbnb hosts in NYC are paying occupancy taxes? What about reporting income? My guess: not too many. And this is completely ignoring zoning regulations that these self-serve hotels trample upon.<p>Im going to guess that these laws will become more prevalent soon unless airbnb & co start become proactive about keeping track of all the relevant taxation.",1279951273

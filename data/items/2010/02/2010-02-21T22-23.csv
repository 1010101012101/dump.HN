Baby boomers are people over 50 or so; digital natives are people under 25.<p>Just about everyone turning 18 today is a digital native -- someone who's grown up with the internet and takes it for granted. Very many of these people have no time for crap like ACTA.<p>Incidently, over half of male voters under 25 in Sweden voted for the Pirate party in the European parliamentary election. If this is a glimpse of the future, I welcome it.",1266789877

Building a drone may not be too hard, but building one that can be operated from the other side of the world is much harder. Furthermore, it turns the conflict to an arms race in which they will find it extremely hard to beat wealthier nations.",1266789793

If you use the same password on a bunch of websites you can be almost certain that it could be easily compromised somewhere along the line.<p>If you don't use a password manager, it is extremely difficult to not reuse passwords and it's just not going to happen for the lay person. Here's the advice that I give to friends:<p>1. At the very least, you should have a secure password for only very reputable websites that control valuable information.<p>2. Use a unique password on your email account.<p>3. Use another password to sites where security isn't that important.",1266789757

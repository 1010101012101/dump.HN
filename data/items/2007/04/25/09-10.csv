Perhaps a different and less confusingly-similar name would have been a better choice.<p>I know this has been done to death in the other thread, but that's what annoys me too... If they had come out right at the start and said, hey, Y Combinator is doing a cool thing here, we love the idea, we are going to work at it and try to offer the same opportunities to people in Europe but in our own way, it could have been a really cool thing.

16594,comment,15628,15628,0,0,schmidp,,,"I think it's a great Idea! I've been at Metalab quite a few times now and it's a great place with great people.<p>Last friday they hosted the first ""Startup Freitag"" (Startup Friday) to bring people interested in startups together. As Paul hasn't talked about YEurope on friday, I guess some opportunities emerged from that first get togehter.<p>I'm eagerly awaiting the next one the 5th of May. I left the last one after a great chat at about 3am (if I remember correctly).<p>While I do understand why people don't like the YEurope copycat from YCombinator, I think the reasons why they did it is obvious: attention and getting the message out fast. Most people interested in startups know about YCombinator and most of them will asume YEurope is doing something similar.\n(time might also have played a factor)<p>I personally know Paul and if you have a look at Metalab and on what he (and the others) achieved there, I think it's a good point to have some trust in YEurope.<p>Many will agree that one of the great values of YCombinator are connections and bringing the right people together. That's exactly what the Metalab is trying to do and has done really well so far.<p>(I first wrote that comment on TechCrunch and then copied it over here)\n",1177493795

True, people will understandably be more sensitive to this and go through a respectful down-period of mourning. But ultimately, the bad guys can't be allowed to suck the fun and joy out of life <i>forever</i>. They can't be allowed to <i>win</i>, and your site does a good job of preventing that ;)<p>On the business side of things - $2 does seem a bit steep for college kids. I know a lot of folks that would just do the game by hand rather than pay that much <i>per person</i>. That doesn't mean you have to lower your list-price though. In fact, you shouldn't. What would be more viral and fun (and educational for your pricing) would be to give out discount codes or to have a special discount assassin week. Then you could play with the pricing - $1, $0.50, etc per person and see how much more demand you get at different price levels. The goal of course is to maximize <i>total</i> revenue. That would also be a good way to introduce new users to your system that otherwise would avoid it and also create more viral spreading for your site.",1177493223

There are some syntactic similarities to Python, but I think it borrows less from it than the previously mentioned.  Matz however did find that reading Python code helped him develop Ruby.",1177492833
16590,comment,16416,16416,0,0,jamongkad,,,"""Interpreting the feedback youve sought on your idea can be scary. Here is a simple yet totally unknown logic to entrepreneurs: when everyone tells you Yes on your startup idea, you probably shouldnt do it. Your idea is either too late to the market or not unique enough to have an edge. On the other hand, if you hear a No a lot, dont get depressed or defensive, pay more attention. This might be good news.""<p>This excerpt is quite confusing...kindly explain in laymens terms please :-)",1177492309

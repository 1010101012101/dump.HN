I put in less hours (but still a lot, it was a pre-launch startup), often took a nap in the afternoon, was much quieter in a way, only asking questions about the code base and e.g. asking for one procedure to be coded in assembler to make the editor we were working on fast enough, etc.<p>My output of <i>working</i> code and functionality was a <i>lot</i> higher, I removed entropy from the code base (the other guy at best didn&#x27;t add a lot), and ended up being demoted and then quitting in disgust.

9757916,comment,9755742,9755742,0,0,VLM,,,"TTL logic?  I see 10K and 470 ohm resistors in the pix, or the color codes are messed up by the camera, and 5V supplies and not a diode in sight and the layout doesn&#x27;t look RTL to me.  This makes the project interesting because &quot;most&quot; retro builders do DTL.  So that&#x27;s cool.  Takes a thundering lot more transistors (admittedly no diodes) and the noise budget and fanout aren&#x27;t as easy but it&#x27;ll work...  I suppose from a parts minimization standpoint you could use the inherent diode in a bipolar transistor to build DTL using only transistors.<p>AFAIK (and I&#x27;ve studied this for awhile) no one has built anything substantial at the transistor level using CMOS architecture.  Virtually everyone does DTL, there&#x27;s plenty of relay based work, this guy is the only discrete TTL family I&#x27;m aware of, and I&#x27;ve seen a little RTL logic family out there.  That would be interesting.<p>I always thought the totem output stage of a TTL gate would be &quot;too hard&quot; compared to the other logic families so I got to hand it to this guy, impressive.<p>A better &quot;vital statistics&quot; comparison would be the DTL logic straight-8 original DEC PDP8 which would vaguely fit on a desk and used about 1500 transistors, 10K or so diodes.  It looks like this:<p><a href=""http://www.pdp8.net/straight8/functional_restore.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pdp8.net/straight8/functional_restore.shtml</a><p>In my infinite spare time I&#x27;m going to build a straight-8 using all SMD components (so my cards will be half business card sized rather than half a sheet of paper sized).  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get to that right about 2080 or so at this rate.  The advantage of cloning an existing architecture is vast piles of software ready to use.<p>The disadvantage of using modern high beta, high Ft transistors instead of 60s era transistors is I&#x27;m likely to build some great VHF/UHF oscillators instead of logic gates.  OP seems to have gotten past this problem, or hasn&#x27;t run into it yet.<p>WRT moving parts and &quot;make it like a book&quot; comments, the last thing you want with 50K or so wire jumpers is movement, even if every bend only breaks 0.01% of wires per &quot;fold&quot; that going to multiply up into pain if you swing 10K wires open and closed 1K times.

Your code is stable, there&#x27;s top-down acknowledgement that you&#x27;re pushing towards tested and maintainable code.  Yet, you&#x27;re being told you&#x27;re... slow.  Now, maybe that&#x27;s true.  All engineers operate at different speeds.  With a proper manager, though, assuming you&#x27;re not going amazingly slow, they should see this and understand it.  If one of your best qualities is being pushed as one of your worst, then management is doing you a disservice, instead of being able to position you get better.<p>Also, consider that you&#x27;re working 12 hour days.  I could, with a little hyperbole, say that you&#x27;re already married to your job. :)  This is already a weird situation.  Are you part of an on-call rotation?  Is it a busy season?  Does your company give out bonuses frequently to acknowledge this extra work being put in?  Consider the psychological and physiological effects of being worried about what your manager thinks of you, getting married and, potentially, the traditional planning rigamarole that goes along with it, along with physically sitting at a computer for 12 hours, all while dealing with the other things normal humans might have to deal with on a day-to-day basis.  It&#x27;s a corrosive situation.  It&#x27;s a negative feedback loop.<p>What I&#x27;m saying, if anything, is that it sounds like maybe you&#x27;re ready to explore other opportunities.  Changing jobs isn&#x27;t simply for making a salary jump.  There are a lot of great companies out there who value the qualities you (not the general &quot;you&quot;, <i>you</i>) possess and have the right management to make sure that your greatest strengths stay that way, and are applied beneficially without being perceived as a risk or liability.  There are also companies where working a normal day, without extended hours, is not only normal, but jokingly enforced... because many companies do actually respect work/life balance. :)",1434977700

It has some serious problems, and those are in my opinion the reason why it&#x27;s not selling very well:<p>The basic idea is great. This game has the kind of factors that <i>make</i> you <i>want</i> to like it: it&#x27;s experimental, it hints at a great story, it&#x27;s a period piece. However, the disappointments keep adding up as you interact with it.<p>Sunset&#x27;s graphics performance is abysmal on OS X. On a current, maxed-out iMac I had to keep lowering the settings throughout play and still wound up with intolerable choppiness. The game <i>does</i> look good, but not <i>that good</i> as to justify having these issues.<p>In the beginning, it&#x27;s fun to play. You discover the house, and the house keeps changing in interesting ways every time you visit. It&#x27;s atmospheric. The music is as stark and beautifully depressing as the apartment. I enjoyed doing the chores, and took great care of what I did in the house. But it soon dawned on me that my actions don&#x27;t really have any consequences. The &quot;plot&quot; keeps moving along, telling you of the results of your actions, whether you actually performed them or not (at least as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s kinda difficult to say).<p>The chores get old very fast, and you start to skip your work. Which doesn&#x27;t seem to be of any consequence at all. The more you play, the more you get the feeling that you&#x27;re moving on rails, pushing difficult-to-reach yet pointless buttons in the process.<p>The monologue put forth by the protagonist isn&#x27;t encouraging either. While at times poetic, it seems mostly banal and fake - which is astonishing considering the subject matter. Talking about banality, I played this on Steam, and you literally get achievements for zooming in on book titles and record labels, for no apparent reason.<p>More than anything, it&#x27;s a missed opportunity. Nobody involved in the process stopped and looked at basic factors like: the pacing, the graphics, the dialogue/monologue, or the user experience overall. The game feels like something you&#x27;d expect to be still in development.<p>Although the game is most likely a labour of love, the jarring shortcomings in its implementation make it look like it&#x27;s coasting along lazily on the merits of its premise without any intention of actually delivering on it.",1434976915

That&#x27;s the way we conceptualize the notion of a class in Ceylon, and it&#x27;s why the syntax for a class looks so much like the syntax for a function, and why there&#x27;s no essential difference between a function defined inside a class (a &quot;method&quot;) and a function declared toplevel, or inside another function, or whatever. Ditto for a value defined inside a class (an &quot;attribute&quot;) and a value declared toplevel or inside another function. It&#x27;s the same thing, as far as Ceylon is concerned.<p>One of the design goals in Ceylon was to treat all these things uniformly, so that a class is, as much as possible, just like any other function.<p>However, there is a big and surprisingly important difference between a class and a function that returns a record: with a class you get open recursion between members of the class. You don&#x27;t get that with a function that assigns members to a record type - or, at least, if you do build the machinery you need to get that, you have essentially reinvented classes with a worse syntax.<p>Open recursion seems like a small thing. But in fact, in practice, if you try taking it away from me, I will have to do some convoluted and nasty things to emulate it. Sure, there are plenty of simple classes where you can do without it, but there are surprisingly many classes where it&#x27;s necessary, or at least very useful.",1434975383

Uniquely, iOS users don&#x27;t have access to alternate music purchasing apps (Apple&#x27;s required 30% cut makes it financially untenable) and iOS users can&#x27;t download and add music to their music library on the go like other platforms.  Plus, Apple devices are only high end (read: expensive) and their users have more purchasing power in terms of apps and music.  So, Apple controls a larger piece of the monetary pie than their 30% market share would let on.<p>Apple will use this market power to make themselves more money.  The reason Taylor Swift&#x27;s piece had to be couched in so many &quot;I love Apple&quot; statements is because Apple controls a lot of her music sales in iTunes, so Apple is in a position of power over her income.  Apple had previously threatened a couple of indie artists with being banned from iTunes if they didn&#x27;t agree to stream their music for free.

I first realised this in Python, where:<p>- Classes can be called like functions<p>- Calling a class runs a function (the constructor, called __init__)<p>- The constructor is implicitly passed a fresh object as an argument (usually called &quot;self&quot;; this is like an implicit use of &quot;new&quot;)<p>- The constructor implicitly returns an initialised object (a mutated &quot;self&quot;)<p>In a language with first-class functions, it&#x27;s also pretty arbitrary to define &quot;attributes&quot; inside the constructor and &quot;methods&quot; outside, since methods are functions which are values (modulo the implicit binding stuff).<p>Hence classes can be completely replaced by their constructors; or in other words, classes are a design pattern when writing functions. This is a realisation that&#x27;s become mainstream due to Javascript, and that&#x27;s the first thing I thought of when I saw the Ceylon code in this article.<p>The details at the end, about execution order, partial constructors, inheritance, etc. all screamed &quot;shadow language&quot; to me: if you&#x27;ve already got functions(/methods), can&#x27;t you just re-use them instead of defining a new, semantically distinct category?<p>[1] <a href=""http://gbracha.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/a-domain-of-shadows.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gbracha.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/a-domain-of-shadows.ht...</a>",1434974623

If that was your only metric, you&#x27;d probably lean pretty heavily on those indicators. However, elite schools are--for better or worse--aiming for a mix of student backgrounds, interests, and experiences on the theory that this creates a richer learning environment than one that&#x27;s solely optimized for conventional academic prowess.<p>It&#x27;s probably also true to say that the Ivies and other top-flight, especially Eastern, liberal arts schools were historically more concerned with admitting &quot;the right sort of people&quot; than the most studious.

The way to get someone out of a negative cascade is not with a ferocious e-mail trying to attack their bad behavior. Its to go on offense and try to maximize some alternative good behavior.

The fact that there are real characters, with names, is crucial to her.  We went on the Friends website, and went through all the information about the characters. Knowing what their hobbies and favorite colors are might seem inane, but it let her connect.

Usually the culprit is overuse of inheritance and design patterns.<p>However, one case where I find myself being less ""fancy"" is functions that run/generate SQL statements.

Also a number of times I would get my local install into a weird state where I could not run migrations, and I'd have to manually patch up.

Here's a good litmus test - seek out a sales professional in your area, pitch him or her on your idea of what you think a sales person would/could do, and get their feedback. You shouldn't have that much trouble finding someone - networking groups, friends, etc should be able to put you in front of a really good salesperson. I think you'll learn a lot by (a) having to come up with a pitch that is focused on selling the idea of bringing a sales person on board, and then (b) I think you'd learn a lot from the feedback the person gives you. It's a no-lose situation for you.<p>I would think that, because this will be a one-sided benefit (your team will benefit from this meeting but the sales person will not), you should keep it brief and buy them lunch/dinner/drinks.

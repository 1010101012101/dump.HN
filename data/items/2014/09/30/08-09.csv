8387263,comment,8386649,8386649,13,0,lemming,,,"Here&#x27;s another interesting tidbit about plain packaging: the Australian government has been sued by big tobacco over this, under the terms of a trade agreement similar to the TPPA that is currently being negotiated in secret. These agreements allow large multinationals to sue governments who are party to them if they feel that legislation enacted by that government unfairly prejudices their business. The tobacco companies couldn&#x27;t sue under the terms of the US-Aus trade agreement so Phillip Morris rearranged their affairs so they appeared as a Hong Kong company and then sued under the terms of that agreement instead.<p>I live in New Zealand, which will unfortunately almost certainly be party to the TPPA before long. This will affect our ability to introduce plain cigarette packaging, resist meddling in our copyright laws and to continue using generic drugs to lower the cost of healthcare for all New Zealanders.<p>The only small glimmer of common sense in all this is that the Australian High Court ruled against the tobacco companies. But we&#x27;ll inevitably end up spending a large amount of our tax dollars on expensive legal battles with companies whose revenue approaches our GDP if we implement legislation that favours our citizens over international big business.

8387252,comment,8386649,8387224,7,0,nrinaudo,,,"Good job on quitting, but a word of warning: you&#x27;ve not hit the hard patch yet. From what all of my friends who quit smoking experienced, 1 month is the real test. I&#x27;ve seen many people quit smoking cold turkey and do great for 1 month, and then get back to it with a vengeance. I&#x27;m not sure what the psychological / physical reason for that is, but thought I&#x27;d warn you to be extra vigilant in 3 weeks - don&#x27;t feel that you&#x27;re finally rid of cigarettes and have a last one to celebrate.<p>I personally smoked about 2 packs a day from 18 to 33 (that&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of wasted money) and quit thanks to e-cigarettes. The trick was to become a proper e-cigarette geek: didn&#x27;t buy pre-manufactured juice but manufactured my own just right, with some essence of pepper for that burning sensation at the back of the throat, some mint for breath-control, and a bit of peppermint because it tastes nice.<p>The first week was hard (apparently - I felt it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but my wife later told me I&#x27;d been a right pain in the arse), but I successfully swapped tobacco addiction to e-cigarette addiction. Since I manufactured my own e-juice, I was able to reduce the amount of nicotine with each new batch, and quickly got to entirely nicotine-free smoking.<p>After a while (3 months, if memory serves), making my own juice became too much of a hassle and I just stopped. Since I&#x27;d gotten rid of the nicotine addiction by then, I didn&#x27;t feel any withdrawal and haven&#x27;t smoked (or wanted to smoke) a cigarette in more than 2 years now.<p>The conclusion is that if you start craving a last cigarette, go for an electronic one. There&#x27;s thousands of shops in Paris (that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re from, right?) and they&#x27;ve become surprisingly affordable - much more so than a sustained tobacco addition, at any rate.",1412065944

These seem to be the only methods available to send log data to them.<p>There is the obvious problem that a DNS record with a 60s TTL cannot possibly receive every single packet sent to it in the event of a server failure. Even if the returned IP address is an elastic IP, it takes a substantial amount of time to move to another instance in AWS.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you would use the same service hostname for all of these endpoints. Separate names for each endpoint, even if they all pointed to the same pool of hosts, would at least give some flexibility in the future when they have enough traffic to get desperate about capacity. I would also think they might want to segregate native syslog from HTTP traffic, since I presume it uses different processes on the backend.<p>It&#x27;s also curious that they chose to return only one A record. DNS RR is a poor substitute for real load balancing, but it&#x27;s better than nothing. With multiple A records, there is at least a chance that some of their traffic will go to other servers -- rather than all of it potentially going to one as it is now.<p>While they made no claims about using Route 53 for its geo DNS capabilities, I still found it amusing that I was sent to a US East IP from California. Not that it&#x27;s super critical that my log lines get delivered quickly, but it is ideal to shorten the path of an insecure and unreliable transport in order to improve durability. Although I would never ship syslog out to some host on the Internet, a host 16 hops away is even more ludicrous.<p>I think their article says a lot more about how poorly ELBs function when you exceed the low traffic threshold it is seemingly designed for than about how well Route 53 works (and it is a decent static DNS service). The inability to robustly direct incoming traffic is the achilles heel of AWS.",1412065092

Theoretically centralization would benefit everyone.  However no one shops downtown if they can avoid it, the parking situation is horrendous and high rents mean higher prices.  So all my retail shopping is done in the burbs.  Which means higher land demand in the burbs (both for the stores, and the free parking).<p>There are ancillary cultural effects.  If you partition an area into &quot;you only go there because you have to go there because there&#x27;s no free parking and no retail&quot; vs &quot;you go there because you want to, and there&#x27;s free parking&quot; the coincidence sets up inappropriate beliefs, like free parking is a universal good or paying to park is a universal bad.  Reality is its more like a circus ride where if your land prices exceed $X/sq foot then both free parking and retail are inherently economically inappropriate in those areas, if at all avoidable.  Stick a super expensive office building on that land instead, etc.  Shoppers and their freely parked cars don&#x27;t belong in areas that cost $2000/sq foot, especially if $20/sq ft is a ten minute drive out of the city.",1417963994

We even have records of their diplomacy with the non-Bantu kingdoms to their south. The Africans they write about (and, in some cases, draw artwork of) bear little relation to the Africans we know today. Sure, expanding human populations have wiped out incumbents everywhere in the world, but it&#x27;s unusual for the eye of recorded history to be so nearby when it happens (North America would be the best example, I guess, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the Bantu expansion is #2).",1417962788

But hey some third world country half a world away and it is just people being unreasonable.<p>Blah, stop putting words in my mouth. I&#x27;m from such a &#x27;third world country&#x27;, and my gf just returned from her work in India. Let&#x27;s also ignore the multiple times someone was charged with rape over there in the US (I don&#x27;t live there, you know). I&#x27;m certainly not saying nobody cares because it&#x27;s India. I&#x27;m saying it appears like a single case related to uber in a country of 1 billion (where rape happens every hour) after millions of rides.<p>> Then why all the hoopla? Why are people so outraged?<p>Because it&#x27;s SYSTEMIC, that&#x27;s my point. It literally, not kidding, literally happens every single day and enough is enough, and it is a consequence partially of some identifiable issues in the police system that they&#x27;re responsible to fix (and haven&#x27;t been doing for decades). That&#x27;s why such a story is interesting. Why is it not interesting if a white person is shot by the police? Because arguably it&#x27;s not systemic, it&#x27;s not based on a certain culture, on certain policies. For example if you go to a police station to train them on cultural sensitivity often the first question is &#x27;what do you think if you see am 18yo black kid in a nice car?&#x27;. They&#x27;ll virtually all say &#x27;drug dealer&#x27;. And the white kid? They&#x27;ll virtually all say &#x27;rich daddy&#x27;. And they&#x27;re brutally honest in this. That&#x27;s literally racial discrimination, as a citizen is seen and treated differently SOLELY based on the color of their skin and such racial profiling it&#x27;s pervasive in American (police) culture. It&#x27;s a small example of how systemic the problem is.<p>But here I DON&#x27;T see that as of yet. It looks like a genuine incident that Uber couldn&#x27;t have done much against. If they screened the driver, he probably wouldn&#x27;t have been filtered out unless he was going around telling everyone of his rapist tendencies. There&#x27;s no gender-violent culture or policies we can specifically identify at Uber that should be rooted out but isn&#x27;t, contrary to howwe can EASILY identify race-biased culture and policies in the American police system that should be rooted out but isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m all for extra screening of taxi drivers by the way and think Uber should be doing this and doing it better. No argument from me there. And while I&#x27;ve never used Uber, unlikely I ever will, didn&#x27;t flag this story, don&#x27;t like uber, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to bring this story as if Uber took some huge missteps and caused this rape.

Buying a pass with WSU would allow me to park  overnight in the close-ish parking structure on the other side of Cass but not access it at night/weekends, or park in the structure on the other side of campus and have access at night and on weekends. Nothing was said about the lots adjacent to my building, but last I checked they weren&#x27;t available at night either.

Three dudes can carry it although each part is pretty heavy and the ammo is not exactly helium balloons either.  So you&#x27;ll find it &quot;organic&quot; with the troops not so much 20 miles behind the lines.  Anyway it&#x27;s &quot;theirs&quot; so they tell their crew what to do rather than some arty support guy coordinating with the aircrew.  Thats why the pilot coordinates with the ground troops telling them to keep firing or cease firing during the airstrike, rather than coordinating with the naval 16 inch battleship guns and the ground troops have no direct involvement in the conversation.<p>So a good use of a mortar is area denial, keep down and stop moving or you&#x27;ll get blown up.  So you find a concentration of troops and pin them down with a mortar every XYZ seconds and call in an airstrike.  Mortars shoot almost straight up so they&#x27;re indirect fire, you can plink away all day and the enemy can do nothing about it unless they have indirect fire capability (like their own mortar, or their own close air support, or arty support, etc).  You can try suppressive fire with a machine gun, but the ammo is really heavy and its direct fire so if you can fire on them, they can fire on you, western gunfight style, so its kinda hazardous.  So if you&#x27;re a ground troop, and you&#x27;ve got an indirect fire weapon like a mortar, you will greatly enjoy using it compared to the alternatives.<p>Most pilots are unamused at the idea of flying thru actively firing artillery.  So stop firing the mortar and hope the enemy doesn&#x27;t do something bad until the airstrike arrives...  Bad being anything from a massive counterattack, or charging your position, or maybe hiding from the airstrike really well.  If the enemy does pretty much anything but lay there, its probably bad for the troops on the ground.  On the other hand there&#x27;s a 1 in a zillion chance of the aircraft getting hit by a mortar round or fragments.<p>The A10 guys let them just keep firing mortars while they attack unlike other pilots.<p>From a complimentary position, obviously a 400 knot fixed wing aircraft has less than 1/4 chance that a 100 knot helicopter has of accidentally getting hit.  And its much more heavily armored than a delicate modern fighter, so taking a hit doesn&#x27;t really matter as much.  Its a flying tank, basically, and/or the pilots are a bit more aggressive so they are willing to take more risks.<p>Not entirely complimentary, as the A10 guys might also be saying that an incoming modern surface to air missile is more lethal overall than getting hit directly or indirectly off their own guy&#x27;s mortars.  Something like getting a 1 in a million accidental hit from a mortar is less dangerous than a 1 in a hundred hit from a modern enemy surface to air missile.  So the mortar fire is stopping the enemy from preparing and firing a SAM at the incoming aircraft.  Who&#x27;s protecting who, exactly?<p>From the ground troop perspective, anytime somebody doesn&#x27;t stop you from suppressive fire is a universal good, so that&#x27;s why they like the A10 so much, regardless of reason.",1417962395

  Senior programmer (28): 5-10 times as valuable as the junior. Makes $120-140k,
  possibly 150k. Serious stock options possible with the right company. Three-
  month job searches.

  Expert programmer (37): 3-5 times as valuable as the senior, so 15-50 times as
  valuable as the junior. Makes $150-200k. Leaves the Bay Area/NYC because he can&#x27;t
  afford to raise kids there. Has a defined specialty. Job searches take 6-8 months
  because he&#x27;s overqualified for everything but high-level positions, and those in
  his specialty number in the single-digits nationally.

  Master programmer (45): TO;DH.

  This industry pays well at the entry-level (if you went to a reputable college,
  live in the right city, know where to look and how to play the game) but doesn&#x27;t
  have a clue when it comes to rewarding excellence. Getting better tends to
  backfire when this industry (being run by dumbass MBA types) continues to

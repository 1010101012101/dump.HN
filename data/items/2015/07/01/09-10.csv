9810902,comment,9804777,9807077,0,0,the8472,,,"> computing the hash of a string key is typically an O(n) operation.<p>The <i>n</i> in operation time on data structures usually refers to the number of members in the data structure. String length would be a different variable.<p>For example worst case for finding a string member in a linked list would be O(n * k) where n is the elements in the linked list and k is the string length. I.e. the worst case here assumes lots of members with shared prefixes.<p>So the O(1) in hash tables actually is O(1 * k).<p>This distinction often is important because the length of strings and the number of members are independent variables.<p>And for many use-cases (e.g. member names in classes or text-protocol keywords) k is essentially fixed, e.g. a maximum member name length of 255 characters or a similar limitation. And for big O notation that means O(1 * 1), since it&#x27;s a constant.",1435744761

Otherwise, JS sucks.<p>> I am a big believer in functional programming (and static types) for large projects, but there is an undeniable bit of awkwardness compared to just imperatively poking things for small projects<p>That&#x27;s funny, because I would say the opposite is true: imperative code with global state is <i>harder</i> to poke around on because it&#x27;s harder to reason about your state, whereas functional code [0] can be sliced and diced and put back together much more readily.<p>There are places where traditional for-loops, with a readily exposed counter, are extremely useful in game programming. Perhaps that is what he means? Map and for-each are great when they are the right tool, but I&#x27;ve personally never subscribed to the idea that they are particularly &quot;easier&quot; to use than for-loops, or &quot;more functional&quot;.<p>> The design usage  is to reference pre-processed models loaded from the net<p>This is a great point. Most (all?) beginner 3D programming tutorials start you off with making your own meshes by hand in code and leave loading models from files until far, far later. This, to me, is exactly backwards. The basics of modeling are not hard to teach, Blender is free, and building static, non-mathematically defined meshes in-code really sucks.<p>[0] with a REPL, any modern language without a REPL is defective.

However, I wanted to note that `&` is also the take-address-of operator in C, which is why you think it has to do with pointers: there are two operators (one taking the address of something, the result of which is a pointer, another taking a bitwise AND); they both use the same symbol &quot;&&quot;.<p>The difference is that the AND is a binary operator — i.e., it takes two arguments:<p><pre><code>    A & B\n</code></pre>\nwhereas the address-of operator &quot;&&quot; is a &quot;unary&quot; operator; it only takes one argument:<p><pre><code>    &A\n</code></pre>\nThere can be something before it in a more complete context, such as:<p><pre><code>    x = 3 + &y;\n</code></pre>\n(though this is more often conventionally written the other way &quot;&y + 3&quot;; I only use this for demonstration)<p>But here &quot;+&quot; is the binary operator. (You can&#x27;t have two binary operators in a row; that would be like &quot;3 + * 2&quot;, which is nonsensical.) This is similar to &quot;3 + -2&quot;: the negative here is a unary operator, the &quot;+&quot; here is the binary operator &quot;add&quot;",1435742888

Why pass around state explicitly when there&#x27;s just one instance of the state? Multithreading wasn&#x27;t on the horizon for game engines in 1993. Single CPU cycles were very much a concern. Developer time was also limited (most of this code was written by a single person in about a year). This wasn&#x27;t a toy project that could have evolved in a million different ways, and it wasn&#x27;t a crypto library either. There was a game that had to be shipped, and John Carmack was surely more concerned about getting the game engine to do precisely what it needed to do to run the game than proofing the code for hypothetical future scenarios.",1435741761

A skilled interviewer can bust through bullshit fairly quickly.  A big problem in interviewing and hiring right now is that most of the interviewers are <i>not</i> skilled.

I ran into a <i>ton</i> of these &quot;take home&quot; interviews and they were some of the most stressful things I&#x27;ve ever done.<p>The first one, they asked me to solve an incredibly complex math problem that I had no idea about so I struggled with it for 5 or so hours before giving up. Probably good that they didn&#x27;t give me the job; if they were expecting me to know the level of math they were requesting then I would have had a pretty bad time. So I guess the test worked in that regard.<p>The second one interview at a different company, they gave me more moderate questions after a phone interview- mostly questions testing knowledge of a specific language. When I asked how long it would take, I was told &quot;you have a deadline of 8 hours from when you download the zip file to when you turn in your code, expect it to take the entire 8 hours&quot;. That was probably the most stressful 8 hours of my life, way worse than any whtieboard interview would have been. I didn&#x27;t look away from my computer once the whole time, did not let myself get up to eat, go to the bathroom, or anything. My girlfriend was in the room and tried to console me while I was doing it and stressing out and I ended up yelling at her to be quiet because I was trying to hard to concentrate. I finished the last problem about 10 minutes before the deadline, zipped the files up, and sent it to them. I never heard back.<p>Favorite interview I&#x27;ve ever had was a combo of a live coding session and a phone interview. They used an online tool that they gave me a link to that had syntax highlighting. The interviewer on the phone could see where I was typing and could highlight stuff etc. Think google docs, but for coding. They asked me to write some algorithms, then asked me to re-write them recursively, then asked a bunch of questions about the limitations of the algorithm, cases when it would be used, etc. It was fun, not stressful in any way, and the interviewer even taught me some things along the way! I feel like they got a really good picture of my thought processes and my personality so they could accurately judge if I would be a good fit on the team.<p>Paying somebody to do the take-home coding assignment and paying them would definitely help alleviate some of the stress, but I&#x27;m still not a fan of the format. You don&#x27;t know how long it took the person to make their solutions, and you don&#x27;t get a good idea for <i>how</i> they work, only <i>what</i> they can do (both are equally important, in my opinion).",1438199344

A friend I know is involved and the guy is a very modestly paid civil servant. It&#x27;s mostly boring and technical bureacratic work.<p>There are very good reasons to conduct discussions like this in private.  Despite the impression the EFF article gives, the biggest losers will be commercial special interests not consumers.  Consumers don&#x27;t form groups to spend millions to lobby politicians to enact laws blocking the import of foreign goods and services - these laws and regulations were campaigned for and paid for by politically connected local commercial interests.  The secrecy is required to prevent these special interests from using their power to derail the negotiations.  Consider what would happen if public minutes were published while say discussing the US bio-ethenol subsidies?  Massive political pressure would be exerted on the US negotiating team from the corn producing states effectively making negotiation impossible.  Other countries party to the discussion would face the same impossible pressures.<p>Finally I don&#x27;t believe that the ISDS is some evil anti-democratic instrument to allow corporations to subvert the local laws. In fact most countries have had similar instruments for decades as part of bilateral deals.  The sole purpose is to prevent governments specifically targetting foreign companies with extra rules while not applying the same restrictions on politically connected local enterprises.  I believe an individual should be able to defend themselves from capricious government behavior through the legal system.

9971058,comment,9967220,9970815,0,0,malandrew,,,"That too is solvable by eliminating local state and has an advantage of making animation time travel debugging possible.<p>So in my comment above I mentioned having a component export two functions. One function is a pure render function and one function creates a state instance. The state of the animation would be one of the things tracked in the state instance:<p><pre><code>    var Observable = require(&#x27;observ&#x27;);
    var svg = require(&#x27;virtual-dom/virtual-hyperscript/svg&#x27;);

    module.exports = state;
    module.exports = render;

    function state(initialPosition) {
        return new Observable(initialPosition || [0,0]);
    }

    function render(positionState) {
        var center = positionState();
        return svg(&#x27;circle&#x27;, {
            &#x27;fill&#x27;: &#x27;rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)&#x27;,
            &#x27;stroke&#x27;: &#x27;black&#x27;,
            &#x27;stroke-width&#x27;: &#x27;2&#x27;,
            &#x27;cx&#x27;: center[0],
            &#x27;cy&#x27;: center[1],
            &#x27;r&#x27;: 10
        });
    }
</code></pre>
The parent component would export its state in the same way. Its own state would be composed by calling the state() function of its own subcomponents. Turtles all the way down.<p>At the top of the app, the saved state would be injected into the state of the top level component, which would decompose it into parts and inject it into the state functions of its subcomponents such as the one above.<p>This single composed state object tree makes it trivial to record diffs in state for playback or to serialize and save the state to localStorage or the network.<p>It&#x27;s trivial to work with the approach above. As trivial as the local state approach of react. It&#x27;s extremely consistent about where state lives. It doesn&#x27;t sometimes live in a global place and sometimes live in some other place. Another developer joining the project doesn&#x27;t have to hunt around for where state for a particular value is being maintained. It also makes it simple to do far more complex things with animation, like build a complex animation editing application where an animation might be controlled by knobs, buttons, sliders, dials, etc. With local state you&#x27;d have to wire up those controls directly to the internal state of a component, completely messing up separation of concerns. With the composed state object, you just write one function that maps the state of two sliders (x&y) to the state of the circle and have it listen to change events on the slider position. It&#x27;s trivial to wire things up in both directions by having them listen to each other.<p>Time travel (undo/redo) is also trivial to implement:
<a href=""https://github.com/Raynos/mercury/blob/master/time-travel.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Raynos/mercury/blob/master/time-travel.js</a>
67 LOC with generous whitespace.<p>You could wire up the time-travel state to a slider as well to accomplish something like this:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri614C_Buwg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri614C_Buwg</a><p>For the viewing state over time features in the froggato level editor you simply take the series of state over time, use it to instantiate state() multiple times and render them all in the same frame.<p>Show one circle:<p><pre><code>    scene -> circleRender(circleStateAtTimePosition(now));
</code></pre>
Show one circle over time:<p><pre><code>    scene -> circleRender(circleStateAtTimePosition(now - 2));
          -> circleRender(circleStateAtTimePosition(now - 1));
          -> circleRender(circleStateAtTimePosition(now));
          -> circleRender(circleStateAtTimePosition(now + 1));
          -> circleRender(circleStateAtTimePosition(now + 2));
</code></pre>
Local state simply makes everything much harder to reason about as you move beyond all but the most trivial apps.<p>Lastly, for long running ephemeral state animations, you gain the ability to &quot;cancel&quot; the animation. Imagine you have a &quot;card&quot; animating out from the right to show a panel, but you click on something else that would close that panel and open another one. It&#x27;s much simpler to cancel that animation midway, close the first card and animate out the second card. The alternative is to add a bunch of methods to the card class to handle the cancellation logic. If you need that cancellation logic in other components you need a mixin, but it&#x27;s all brittle because its tied to the key names on this.props as opposed to being able to make a animation controlling function used in an animation coordinator that merely needs to receive cursors (i.e. nothing is hard coded to key names)<p>You might say &quot;but I have no reason to track ephemeral state in that way&quot; and you would be correct, you don&#x27;t need to. But there are no disadvantages of doing so relative to local state. Furthermore you gain predictability about where state lives and the ability to not worry about refactoring if one day decide that you want to now control a particular piece of ephemeral state.",1438198564

The too busy to do a big programming assignments can code in front of me for an hour. I should be able to judge their chops pretty fast.

For example, someone&#x27;s preferences in music or entertainment or food purchasing could closely correlate to their ethnicity, which in turn could correlate to lowered access to capital due to historic racial discrimination. You may be telling yourself you&#x27;re writing an impartial algorithm, but it&#x27;s not impartial, it&#x27;s just opaque. How do we know that the &quot;prepaid cellular&quot; metric isn&#x27;t just a proxy for &quot;black people&quot; or &quot;recent immigrants&quot; for example?<p>Likewise, you have the other problem, which is trusting the data in the first place. We have some stringent laws in this country about the ability for a consumer to see and correct data that leads to negative lending decisions being made about them. Perhaps its interesting that &quot;giving up a prepaid wireless number&quot; is a really bad data point when deciding to lend me money. But what if I never actually had a prepaid phone at all, and some database somewhere that I can&#x27;t see says that I did? That&#x27;s not only a problem it&#x27;s actually illegal.<p>The article makes a show of taking a critical eye towards this method of evaluating creditworthiness, but somehow doesn&#x27;t raise two of the really serious Achilles heels that are baked into all such schemes and have been problematic for awhile.",1438197306

Not just as we knew it, but every dystopian prediction of the future where we are ID&#x27;d, tagged, and tracked at every action has already come true.<p>Not for the sake of some vast government surveillance apparatus (while they are one of the factors behind this movement, the US government is too bloated and largely too incompetent to be effective at this even if they wanted to) but because there is money to be made in knowing our every detail. In our consumer society, marketers/retailers and the companies that cater to their businesses find great value in this information, and as consumers, we largely benefit from having the efficiencies of amazon product recommendations, facebook/twitter suggestions, tailored advertising, etc... at the cost of some loss in privacy. And people have largely silently accepted this, unknowingly or otherwise.<p>I have a facebook, linkedin, google, github, multiple handhelds, multiple email accounts, I&#x27;m a former federal employee, I&#x27;ve had the same phone number for the past 15 years, and countless other retail/online accounts. If you know my name and middle initial, you can find most of my personal information - age, former/current addresses, relatives - through a quick google search on Intelius. I&#x27;ve requested they take down my information several times, and it seems to disappear from their public listing for a while, but reappears after a couple years or after I&#x27;ve moved again.<p>I accepted long ago that any/all information I post online (and even locally on my Macbook in some cases) is being scraped, compiled, and stored in some DB somewhere. It would only take a little focus and some link analysis to build a comprehensive profile of nearly every detail of my life using some basic selectors - primarily my email and phone. I assume every link, website (yes, including every porn - pornhub has an analytics team!!!), email I write/send, emails I draft but don&#x27;t send, fb picture I stalk, youtube video I watch is being tracked/stored/compiled somewhere. If it&#x27;s not by default made public information or being used by the company in question for their profit motives, I assume it will be in the future when the information is hacked/sold/&quot;leaked&quot; for whatever reason.<p>As I sit here on my school&#x27;s public WiFi, I know my IP/MAC address/cookies are exposed to those with the know-how, but I&#x27;ve since given up trying to avoid that. Encryption protocols have been broken too many times to count, and while we continually fight for better security methods, those with enough motivation will find ways around - e.g. NSA firmware hacking. I&#x27;ve decided the only information that is truly private are the thoughts in my head, but it seems that even that is subject to debate (look up memory transplants).<p>It&#x27;s alright though, because as we head towards the singularity, my consciousness will be assimilated somehow into some Borg-like meta-consciousness anyway.

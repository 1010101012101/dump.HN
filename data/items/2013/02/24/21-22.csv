Assume the chances of twitter getting a callback on that ad is uniform ( very unlikely, but play along ). That means roughly 50% of folks will ignore the ad or dismiss the ad, the rest will actually engage with the ad impression. Lets say twitter makes a dollar per engagement. How many ads need to be shown to make the first dollar ? Two dollars ? How about five, ten, hundred, or a million ?<p>That's what this problem gets at.And in case you are curious about the solution to all that money -<p><pre><code>     ----\n     scala> def uniform = util.Random.nextDouble\n     def sumsTo(n:Int) = {\n         var (times, sum) = (0.0d,0.0d);\n         while(sum < n) { sum += uniform; times += 1.0d; };\n         times \n     }\n     def meanSumsTo(n:Int) = \n      (1 to 1000000).map(_=>sumsTo(n)).sum/1000000.0d\n\n     List(1,2,5,10,100,500,1000).map(x=> (x,meanSumsTo(x))\n\n     scala> res1: List[(Int, Double)] = List((1,2.718594), (2,4.672438), (5,10.665755), (10,20.668308), (100,200.65537), (500,1000.669558), (1000,2000.669246))\n     ----\n\n    So you need to show 3 ads to make a buck, 5 ads to make $2 etc.</code></pre>",1361743153

5276081,comment,5275313,5275313,4,0,pedrocr,,,"Like everyone seems to be mentioning this post is really about ""you should have automatic builds"" and make is just an incidental. redo[1] is another interesting make replacement that keeps most of the good points of make (e.g., simple and shell based), while having a more powerful dependency mechanism. It's even compatible with make itself allowing you to move a part of a recursively built project to redo, while having it call into make for other subcomponents.<p>What I've done before when doing data-driven blog posts[2][3] was to write the whole analysis end-to-end in ruby, including branching out to R for stats and graphing[4]. I ended up using rake (ruby's make-like tool) to tie everything together with dependency tracking but I could just as well have written a script that would call everything in order. Doing that gives you a way to quickly reproduce results (what's discussed here) but also, together with version management, a way to go back to previous versions and use things like ""git bisect"" to figure out when you introduced a bug.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/apenwarr/redo/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/apenwarr/redo/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pedrocr.pt/text/how-much-gnu-in-gnu-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pedrocr.pt/text/how-much-gnu-in-gnu-linux</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://pedrocr.pt/text/preliminary-results-open-source-evolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pedrocr.pt/text/preliminary-results-open-source-evolu...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/pedrocr/codecomp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pedrocr/codecomp</a>",1361742904

They upsell on finding good candidates because they are the only people that have the time/resources to actually do that kind of scanning.  It is pretty shady but apparently lucrative.

Now show OO some love and stop discouraging the using of classes.<p>What do you mean by true OO?<p>It does not matter if you ""love"" objects or not.\nYou can't write in python without OO. Every python module is an object, defs and vars - members of object. (Even classes and other modules are members of module object).",1361739755

However, Make has one feature that I really need, that I rely on to speed up builds: parallel dependency construction.<p>The last time I checked, neither Maven nor Rake do this properly.  Maven runs everything inside a single VM.  Who wants to have to worry about multithreading in their unit tests?  Rake requires thread support in the underlying Ruby interpreter (why?).<p>I've got 64+ hardware threads (Sparc T4-1) all sitting there waiting to be spun up and do my bidding.

Or are they just responding to the notices they've always gotten from 3rd parties about infringement on their network with these educational/throttling responses instead of merely passing on the notices. A graduated response system need not involve new surveillance. Most of the notices were from movie studios and record labels hiring companies that participate in torrent swarms, produce logs of all the peers sharing pieces of the torrent with them, then send out notices to the ISPs associated with those IPs.",1361739653
5275893,comment,5275693,5275839,3,0,gizmo686,,,"Encryption has been the default setting in most bittorrent clients for a while now. The fundamental problem is that no matter how good you encryption is, if some simply attempts to download the file themself, they can see what IPs are supplying them the pieces. In order to solve this, you would need to add an additional layer to the protocol, where a user downloads and uploads files not related to the ones they want for themselves, so knowing the IP that is uploading the file to you does not help you find someone who is actually responsible. At this point, you are probably better off running existing clients through a TOR proxy.",1361739622

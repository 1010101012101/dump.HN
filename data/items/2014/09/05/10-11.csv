8273204,comment,8272603,8272603,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This sort of thing is a fundamental problem of professional sports, and one of the major reasons why I&#x27;m sort of agnostic about the very idea of pro sports in general.<p>Sports are supposed to be a game, they are supposed to be non-serious, but also competitive. Therein lies the fundamental conflict at the heart of all sports, especially at a professional level. It can quickly become difficult to find the right balance between utter seriousness and playfulness when it comes to sports. This gets even worse when millions of fans and billions of dollars play a role. They tip the scale from the playful side to the serious/business side. Sport stops being play and becomes more and more a job. A thing to be executed to the utmost at all cost.<p>That&#x27;s why you get massive steroid and other drug use, which has been a problem in all sports for perhaps half a century, if not longer, though not widely known. That&#x27;s where you get fans whose emotional well-being are tied to whether their favorite team has won or lost recently (domestic violence is heavily affected by sports outcomes, for example). Then you have sports riots, and so on. It&#x27;s quite a mess all around, but it&#x27;s not exactly an easy problem to fix.",1409914416

Now, I have no interest in a vacuum at the moment, but they had a Dyson Ball, and I&#x27;ve seen countless videos of it, and had to take a look to see this high-end vacuum. I was disappointed from the first second, it just looked like a bunch of cheap plastic parts, and similar to something I&#x27;d find from a yard sale ten years ago. Photo below of my expectation from all the marketing, and a photo someone took of the actual vacuum.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/bs1ygfM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/bs1ygfM.jpg</a><p>I played around with it for a bit, and it just felt cheap, in every way possible. I was expecting the best vacuum in the world, and I was holding something that was entirely different. Now, I don&#x27;t own one, it might work great for vacuuming, but it had no sense of luxury in person.<p>Another example, is the handheld vacuum, I&#x27;d see commercials on television, and then I saw one in the wild at a friends house. Comparison below is using slightly different models, but just look at the materials. In the promo image, it looks like glass and metal, and then in reality, it&#x27;s some cheap stamped plastic that you&#x27;d expect from a bottom of the barrel vacuum.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/RZ8sFxq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/RZ8sFxq.jpg</a><p>As for the hand dryers, I find they work well and fast.

It is possible to overload them and cause premature burnout but hard to determine if the load is too much, since much of it is self generated. It is important to make sure such people take enough time off and that the workload does not exceed 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 times what is normal.</i><p>Another huge lesson, particularly for the younger people on HN, is that if you find yourself working at an organization in which the rules here are being consistently violated, <i>you are working at a sick organization and/or have a grossly incompetent manager</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve had management all over the map.  One of the best had a great deal of government (and military) experience.  He wasn&#x27;t overtly technical (though he knew more than he let on), but saw when goals were and weren&#x27;t being met, and would ensure that resources were made available and barriers removed, often without asking.  Two specific instances come to mind:  I required additional systems permissions for a specific task, told him, he was on the phone to the responsible person and I had the privileges within ten minutes (I&#x27;ve worked at shops where this is a 24-48 hour, or longer, task).  Where my workflow made heavy use of multiple terminals and screenspace, and secondary large monitors were a rarity, when one freed up it was on my desk the next day without my asking for it.<p>And when business conditions went south (there were a <i>lot</i> of people hit), our parting conversation was direct, to the point, and personal.  What I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have to deal with was weeks or months of anxiety leading up to that point.<p>The gig following that one, with a young manager in start-up space, was a polar opposite, and, at least from a management perspective, a strongly negative contrast (though not the worst I&#x27;ve had).",1409912893

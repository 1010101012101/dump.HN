Silently dropping email (no smtp transaction bounce, not in junk, no rules in place) for a specific single sender at a domain, where email from other senders at the same domain is accepted. Hundreds of people have posted about this online with no fix or acknowledgement from Microsoft.<p>2. Overly strict hardfail SPF policy by default for new customers who have no idea of SPF and should be using softfail. These customers often use third party systems to send out hundreds of account statements. These get blocked by other email hosts. The customers themselves have no idea and never correct their SPF, saying something like &quot;it must be an issue on your side&quot;.<p>3. Blocking entire /24 IP ranges including good senders with good reputation, on the basis of only a single spammer in the range. This particularly affects those in datacenters, even if you are on a dedicated machine and your IP is good.<p>4. It may be that Office 365 does not track or measure domain reputation at all, which makes things like SPF or DKIM of little positive use, and introduces loads of spam false positive bounces.",1448960354

10654259,comment,10651504,10653192,0,0,jules,,,"Being a religious idiot is not the same thing as being desperate, mentally unwell, and disaffected. The point is that the picture that is being sketched is in-congruent with reality. If we want to have any chance to solve this issue the first step needs to be a honest examination of the causes, not academics taking their pet topics and trying to fit terrorism and ISIS into that.<p>What causes a successful college student who has just gotten a job as an architect to decide that the best use of his life is to fly a plane into a building? What causes a person in their twenties in Europe to decide that the best use of their life is to go to Syria to join the Islamic State? Or to go to Paris and shoot up a theater?<p>Let&#x27;s back up a bit. What causes a person to decide to go to planned parenthood to shoot up a bunch of doctors? Is it because of income inequality? Climate change? Russian foreign policy? Or maybe it is because he is sincerely convinced that the metaphysics of this world work as follows. At the time of conception the soul enters the embryo. In order for this soul to enter heaven the baby needs to be baptized. If this doesn&#x27;t happen then their soul either goes to burn in eternal hell or to limbo. Now, there is a clinic next door where people are literally killing babies before they are baptized (i.e. abortion). The doctors are evil maniacs who are putting thousands of babies in hell. Maybe we should do something to defend those babies? God wants us to do something to save His babies! If we don&#x27;t save His babies we are evil and he will put us in hell!<p>You see, the problem is that in this worldview shooting up doctors at planned parenthood is a most moral action.<p>Now imagine that you sincerely believe in the following metaphysics. We are living in the Matrix, but this Matrix is a bit different than the one in the movie in that to leave it you don&#x27;t pick up a telephone, but you have to die. This Matrix has been set up by the Creator to test you. If you obey his commands you will get eternal bliss in heaven when you exit the Matrix, and otherwise you get eternal suffering in hell. What are the Creator&#x27;s wishes? He hates the Infidels. He hates that they publish cartoons to make fun of Him. He hates their societies are filled with sex, personal enrichment, and lack of devotion to Him. He hates that they occupy Jerusalem, His holy city. He hates that there is no worldwide Caliphate. He has written in his book that to ensure a place in heaven you can kill infidels. You get 72 virgins in heaven, and you get to pick a dozen people from your family who will also get a place in heaven. So what is this guy thinking while shooting up random people in a theater in Paris? He is counting the kills, and the Creator is counting with him. The number of people he kills will determine how much the Creator will love him. When he has killed enough he presses the button on his suicide vest to teleport into heaven, and start selecting family members to ensure their place in heaven when they die.<p>This Jihadist suicide cult worldview is the #1 problem, and people keep writing articles about income inequality, climate change, foreign policy, etc. No doubt these are contributing factors, but when are we going to address the elephant in the room? This is not something that only the mentally ill can believe in. This is a mind virus that can spread. It <i>has</i> spread. Polls show that about 10% of Muslims worldwide support ISIS, that is 160 million people. We need to stop it from spreading, for instance by encouraging competing pacifist mind viruses of moderate Muslims, empowering people who have a personal stake against this mind virus (women, gays, intellectuals, etc), educating people about different religions and atheism, stopping people who are spreading this mind virus (there are many Salafist and Wahhabist organizations that openly operate in Europe), and stopping their money streams coming from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, provide intense personal support to refugees and immigrants to make sure they integrate into the societies in Europe and the US and to make sure they learn the language, get European and American friends, don&#x27;t live in closed parallel societies, etc.",1448960207

Alternatively you can heap allocate each subarray at the expense of slower operations, but resulting in a more typical 100% worst-case overhead.<p>So you&#x27;d store like this<p><pre><code>    |----------HEADER---------| |-----------------------BUCKETS------------------------|\n     idx\n    (0, 3) (2, 2) (1, 4) (_, _) [1, 3, 7, _] [14, 15, 16, 19] [9, 12, _, _] [_, _, _, _]\n        length\n</code></pre>\nCache efficiency might also suggest you store the minimums of each list in the tuples.<p>So to search for a value, you do a binary search over the header to find the wanted bucket and then over the bucket to find the value. That&#x27;s O(log n).<p>Insertion is O(sqrt n) since you need to find the bucket and then do a normal insertion into it. You might need to reallocate the whole thing (remember to increase bucket size!) but that&#x27;s amortized out.<p>Deletion is even easier since you don&#x27;t have to deal with overflow (although you might want to move empty buckets to the end or merge adjacent ones, maybe). O(sqrt n).<p>Creating the structure is trivially O(n log n), since it&#x27;s sorted.<p>Converting to a sorted list is just compacting the buckets.<p>You also get access by index at O(sqrt n) speed since you just need to traverse the counts in the header. Not perfect, but close.<p>For a cache-efficient design it&#x27;s pretty neat. Binary searches are fast, after all.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/implementation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/implementati...</a><p>[2]: When you split an overfull subarray, each new subarray will be half full.",1448960112

Looking the part for programmers is very different than for business people, but it&#x27;s still a thing.

It all seemed pretty ridiculous to everyone in my class.<p>But this seems equally ridiculous, worked 4 places before starting my own company, and open office spaces were a thing in all of them. They ranged from absolutely horrible to fantastic. Good noise canceling headphones can cancel out most sounds, but there&#x27;s no &quot;cure&quot; for visual disturbances, which for me (and a good part of my former colleagues), are almost as bad for my concentration as sounds. So in the worst open office spaces, there was always a &quot;race&quot; to get the best spots, whenever anyone moved places.

One might as well browse stackexchange (e.g. arqade) for leisure or code personal project. The terribleness of NSFW link would be the shame/embarrassment you inflict on yourself and maybe an occasional finger pointing if anyone happens to witness.<p>The noise level is definitely higher than in a private office, but then again - culture. Either your colleagues are understanding to keep the noise level down or not. I can/could easily listen to music at comfortable levels even with open headphones.<p>A much bigger issue is that people tend to have coffee/smoke breaks in groups and it requires some self control not to take a break with each and every group.\nI&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s an issue, but since people tend to work different hours (e.g. 7-16, 9-18) it also puts some unconscious pressure to work 9-16 or 7-18.<p>Quite a lot of the &quot;issues&quot; (differences from an office) are related to the person/culture and not the workplace itself.",1448959688

Even if something like Freebooting is a problem, it is not logical to impose obligations, whether moral or legal, on people who lack the information required to accurately judge the situation.  This is why I keep pointing out that only the copyright holder and those they inform (say, via DMCA notices) has any actual knowledge of what is and is not infringement.<p>I cannot take that statement about the &quot;actual number&quot; of infringing videos being much higher at face value.  It requires making too many assumptions without evidence, not the least of which is that none of the notices they have received is bogus.  It does not appear to be based on evidence, as the actual notices mentioned are not on Lumen for public review.  Given that your profile claims that you work for Uber Entertainment and not someone close to this story, I have to ask how you can claim that as fact when it does not appear that the general public has access to the information required to claim that as fact, given that said facts do not appear to be publicly available.<p>Interestingly, in attempting to find a way to review the notices more objectively, I found what appears to be your company.

Clearly there is a trend away from &quot;traditional&quot; offices, but it appears to be moving in two fundamentally opposite directions at the same time.<p>Of course, both share one significant feature: cost savings compared to a more traditional office environment.  I guess another similarity could be increased equality, although again, achieved in opposite manners: in one case, everyone gets to choose their own work environment, and in the other, everyone has an identical work environment.  (Right down to a lack of personal effects in this case.)  Still, the proponents of both approaches appear to believe they offer many other advantages.  I wonder whether we&#x27;ll see one or the other ultimately dominate.<p>Personally speaking, as the owner of a small, all-remote company, I vastly prefer the remote approach for my own quality of life.  (Although I&#x27;ve certainly known people who prefer to go to an office every day.)  As far as work output though, both remote work and open offices have advantages and disadvantages. Personally I can&#x27;t stand the distractions being crammed in a room with a bunch of other developers, but at least being in the same building undoubtedly makes collaboration easier (not that it&#x27;s impossible remotely). The company culture can definitely do a lot to make that sort of environment more pleasant too. (Things like avoiding noise pollution, and knowing when not to interrupt.)

10654185,comment,10654184,10654184,0,0,antirez,,,"I really loved this post, and experimented what Michel says with my hands in the context of Redis. The Redis code base is in general not rocket science, is pretty understandable and does not use too complex ideas. I simply don’t trust my ability to write complex and correct code at the same time, and so far this approach worked well, Redis is quite stable all considered. However the file implementing replication, replication.c, gained complexity very fast compared to the other parts of Redis over the years. It’s 2500 lines of code, while for example cluster.c is 5000 lines of code, but even at 2x the size, cluster.c is simpler to understand. The reason is exactly what Michel says: a code that matches a mental model. How replication.c got its complexity is easily explained. Redis replication was extremely simple at start. Just streaming replication between master and slave(s). You connect, get the initial payload representing the dataset on the master, and starting from there is just streaming of write commands received by the master (from the clients) to the connected slaves. Then we added partial resynchronization. Later we added in-memory replication (called diskless replication) for environments with slow disks, chained replication, and so forth. Instead of redesigning the code in order to cope with the new complexity, I usually approach the issue in a different way: I modify what I’ve with the minimal set of changes to make it working. This usually is a good strategy in my opinion, since to make something <i>truly</i> general sometimes makes it more complex than having something simpler with a few exceptions to handle corner cases. However this approach does not scale a lot, eventually the code is structured like if the problem was simpler, but has a lot of exceptions. When you reached this point, you can no longer build a mental model of how the code works. The result was that we (Redis Labs Redis core team and I) recently found a number of bugs in corner cases that could arise mixing diskless replication with PSYNC with other unexpected events. While fixing those bugs I started to refactor replication.c in order to make it structured in a way that it is possible to create a mental model about it again, so that the actual layout of the code reflects a bit more what are the moving pieces: the action of creating the initial synchronization payload, the slave attempting a partial synchronization, and so forth. There is still work to make, but in general, its very important to write code for which a simple mental mode exists <i>and matches</i> the code layout.",1448958675

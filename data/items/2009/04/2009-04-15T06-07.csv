It won't let me choose the exact mix of characteristics I want and instead, restricts me to the ones it displays.<p>I understand that recommendation engines need to work within certain predefined parameters, but that's exactly why they'll usually disappoint - you can't categorise a person's preferences into predefined parameters.

Yes, it's advertised as being able to run a large external display. But the question is: ""can it do both of these things (in the case of Xcode, most likely building some complex project) simultaneously, and persist in so doing for an extended period of time?""<p>It appears the answer to that question is ""no"", and frankly I don't find that particularly surprising. I also don't think it really contradicts the marketing materials. Consider a different example: the MacBook Air comes with a wide variety of applications preinstalled, and this is an advertised feature of the laptop. But if I attempt to launch and use them all simultaneously, the system will become unusable very quickly as it runs out of RAM and has to start swapping. Does that mean Apple is falsely advertising its capabilities by touting the applications which come preinstalled?",1239777197

563065,comment,562827,563034,0,0,henryl,,,"I find Netflix's recommendations to be far superior. Participants in the Netflix Prize have found that content-based filtering (such as ""nano categories"") actually hurts relevancy (in RMSE terms) when working with large data sets. That is, when you have a copious amount of data, it is usually better to let the data speak for itself. Similarly, it has been noted by Google and others that the better your data, the less impressive your algorithms need to be. Most people think Google's success is mainly attributed to magic algorithms, but most of their effort of late has been in increasing the quality and breadth of their data.<p><a href=""http://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/2008/03/more-data-usual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/2008/03/more-data-usual.h...</a>",1239776907

563062,comment,561311,562286,0,0,Radix,,,">Odd. I've been an introvert for my whole life, and this is the first time I've ever come across such a brilliant description of what's going through my mind when I'm propelled into a crowd of people and asked to endure the hot air and noise they call socializing. I'm not shy either, yet I've always lacked the compunction to talk for the sake of filling a silence. <i>Thanks for the link. It's been mailed to all the people who've called me an anti-social bastard down the years :)</i><p>The italicized portion of this comment from elsewhere in the thread shows how some introverts feel when young.  I've been told many times, in the past, that I am antisocial and have grown to resent the idea.  In our society (america) antisocial is almost a pejorative.  So, I remember deciding that introversion was a fine trait to have and was more desirable than the chattering extroversion of my peers.  People are just reacting against the expectation of extroversion, the response is too strong at first, but then they reach a balance.  That's how this sort of reaction happens.<p>I agree with your comment generally though.  I just believe the sooner people accept that introversion is an acceptable personality trait they can lean this 'personal growth' for what it will get them instead of some misguided belief they should be acting differently.  Still, I can see ""oh, I'm just introverted"" being a crutch for shyness and fear, I'm still getting over those.  But, I'm not exactly sure how.",1239776436

563060,comment,562799,562799,0,0,10ren,,,"The closing tags of HTML and XML are a nuisance. In SGML (their common predecessor), named closing tags were optional (you used </>), but were deliberately made mandatory in HTML and XML, to improve readability of long documents. It was contentious at the time, and it still is. But we must at least accept the data points that both HTML and XML have been <i>phenomenally successful</i>, without knowing for sure whether this particular feature was for or against.<p>One thing about dumb, regular, symmetrical formats is that their redundancy makes them less scary and easier to understand. Perhaps, this is accessibility is crucial for adoption.<p><i>EDIT</i> I guess indentation enables you to match up start/end tags even better than named close tags... and it's certainly become more familiar to developers since Python's success. But maybe not so good when you have many levels of indentation, and terrible if you want to insert/delete a nested element, because the indentation of the elements within it must also be changed.",1239776126
563059,comment,562911,562911,0,0,jmtame,,,"This is a classic problem in start ups, and I would strongly recommend against doing remote if you can avoid it.  I only know a few people who have ever pulled it off successfully, and they are <i>really</i> good.  Statistical outliers.<p>You cannot replace having an entire team in the same spot where people can grab a white board and clearly talk about what something means.  Just the energy alone is probably enough to keep everyone active on the project.  It's difficult when you don't see others contributing to a project.  You start to think you're putting in more work than the rest.<p>I've worked for two start ups.  The first one didn't do remote work, and while the leadership initially was poor, the execution was actually insane.  The second start up had mostly remote workers, a few PhDs in the same city, and me and another guy doing the front end and servers, and it was a little slow.  I tried to recruit some people who had worked at Google and YouTube (as undergrads), and they turned the offer down simply because most of our team was remote.  A lot of people join a start up because they want to meet other smart people, not just work on a cool product.",1239776041

563055,comment,562827,562901,0,0,ken,,,"Strange.  My first reaction is that the auto-complete was so bad that it, alone, would keep me from ever returning.  I typed in ""Ran"" (the last film I saw), and then I had to click a tiny down-arrow about 25 times, and the down-arrow jumps around as you go.  What takes ""3 letters + return + click"" on IMDB, took ""3 letters + 25 precise clicks + return"" on Nanocrowd.  Autocomplete is usually an optional assist; here, it's more like a mandatory in-place search system with awkward controls.<p>I would have left a note about this (and other issues), but their only feedback mechanisms seem to be email or logging in to Blogger.<p>It may be the coolest recommendation algorithm ever, but from these first two things I tried, the interface seems fairly high-overhead.  You need to hook me before I'll go for high-overhead.  You need to convince me that you're more valuable than, say, simply listing other films by the same director.  For ""Ran"", Nanocrowd recommends ""Rambo"" -- 'nough said.  :-)",1239775408
563054,comment,562911,562911,0,0,frossie,,,"Good piece, good advice. Since OP was generally negative on remote work, I want to put forward a counter-example of situations when remote work is an advantage: When you can get 24 hour support without anybody working nightshifts (by harnessing timezones) and even more, when you are shielding valuable people from operational hassles in order to allow them development time.<p>OP says: ""What was a 27-second walk down the hallway to yell at Bob about his crap code is a now 30-minutes constructing an email."" My response to that is (a) dude, pick up the phone, it won't take more than 27 seconds but more to the point (b) Maybe Bob would write less bad code if he didn't have people waltzing in to talk to him all the time.<p>I totally sympathise with the telecon complains though and I agree, it's not for everyone.

The system will become completely unusable while the 'kernel_task' takes over the system trying to cool it down.<p>I've experienced the exact same thing running a 24"" LCD, firefox, and Entourage.

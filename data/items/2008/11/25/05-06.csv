Beyond that, a PhD does say something about a candidate, but presuming you'd want them for a development task, it doesn't speak much to their suitability for performing that task.<p>One place that you might have luck would be on the ACM job boards.  Many of the SIG announcement lists primarily cover open positions.  While I'm often critical of the ACM, that would seem to have a similar target audience to what you're after.",1227592453

I don't feel that any system I've tried (~dozen) really beats it when it comes to internal software development inside of an organization. For open source, distributed version control makes a lot more sense, but internally, Perforce is pretty hard to beat and modified versions of it are used at places like Google and Microsoft.<p>What reasons do you dislike Perforce?

In my mind the credibility of this document is already shot for this audience, and we're not even half-way in.<p>Two founders?  50/50.  If you find a co-founder that you see eye-to-eye with and you have non-overlapping responsibilities, you can make it work.  I'm an equal partner in Wikispaces, and it works.  The alternatives are worse.  Get over the theoretical deadlock case, if this happens for real, you're in serious trouble regardless of the split.<p>Three founders?  Find a split that works based on background, past and future contribution, etc.  Use a spreadsheet if it helps, but be prepared to really, deeply debate this.  How the three of you handle this early discussion is a good indicator of how future -- possibly much more difficult -- discussions will go.<p>Four or more founders?  No idea.  Probably trouble.",1227590146

We have some apps here that people didn't make good interfaces for, so when we needed to integrate with the data some folks decided to get at the data directly.  Now we're committed to the current schema (and database).<p>Everything else about this article kind of rubs me the wrong way though -- all the talk about these ""non-relational"" databases.  ""Non-relational"" databases often don't have relational db features because they can't figure out how to do it given their distributed and/or massive nature.  It's certainly not because relational dbs are bad.<p>Also, the reason why object databases failed is so obvious: there's no precise agreement on what an object is.  It's too vague.  There's no theory behind ""objects"", (compare with relational algebra).  Do you have multiple inheritence, or not?  Are classes first-class (Smalltalk, Python) or not (C++)?  Are ""objects"" class-based or prototype-based?<p>What we really need (perhaps in addition to less-than-relational databases that are able to handle distributed and large datasets) are more completely relational databases that, among other things, have a rich enough feature set to obviate any need for denormalization and allow us to tell the database more information on what we need it to optimize for us, etc, etc.",1227589994

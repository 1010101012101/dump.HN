3161313,comment,3161133,3161133,4,0,larsberg,,,"Some feedback on this graphic's data:<p>At least at Microsoft, my recruiters told me that a <i>huge</i> portion of the resumes submitted were from people who submitted either every day or multiple times a day. There's a ""zeroth"" reviewer that is a computer that determines and processes duplicates. I'd assume Google has the same problem and a similar solution (or else they hire a <i>lot</i> of recruiters).<p>I don't think this graphic's ""25% increase"" number accounts for attrition. I would expect Google's total attrition number (bad+good) to swing between 5-10% year to year.<p>Would people please stop quoting salary numbers as if that's the major portion of compensation at these kinds of companies? The reason it's hard to leave places like MSFT/Google/Amazon isn't the salary; you can get that anywhere. It's the N-year vesting stock grants. Once you've been there for N years, you have a full set rolling and vesting each year, with the number increasing every year. As you pass N years, you typically go from 100% of your salary in additional stock-grant income to some moderate integer multiple. Not counting bonuses. It's getting people to leave behind many hundred thousand dollars of pending grants that's tough, not matching the salaries.",1319680723

Parrots are wonderful creatures.<p>I will point out that, though letting your parrot out of the cage for indoor exercise is important -- and they do indeed love to climb around, so get a big ol' play gym with branches and little chains and stuff -- nobody in the (North American) pet-parrot literature recommends letting them outside. Indeed, letting a hand-raised parrot escape to the outdoors is a classic way to get them killed. They have no idea what to do out there, they often get lost or confused or stressed and fail to come home, even from the top of a tree right next door. And, obviously, there are a lot of dangers to a naive bird in a tree: Hawks, cats, other mammals, perhaps even snakes...<p>Now, obviously there are lots of places where wild parrots live outside by the thousand. And in the right climate even former pet birds can successfully transition back to the wild. (Even in North America: See <i>The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill</i>, a great movie.) And if you had an originally-wild bird it's even less surprising that it managed to negotiate trips to the trees and back. But it's kind of fortunate that yours kept coming back.",1319679860

Every month or so, another ""look at this evil bill that will destroy our liberties"" article comes out, and everybody gets all worked up about it.<p>tl;dr - The judges sitting on federal courts and the supreme court aren't responsible to voters, don't need campaign funds, and don't have a career to worry about. In the unlikely event that this bull makes it out of congress and past the president, it'll be struck down. Just like it has been every time before.<p>Sure. If this bill was an enforced law, that would be bad. Unthinkably bad. But that goes for a great deal of what happens in congress - especially the House. A small portion of this manure actually manages to make it out of congress and past the president - and it gets taken to the courts. The more interesting cases make it to the Supreme Court, where the nine judges who aren't up for re-election, have no career to worry about, and are already rich enough to be well impossible to buy off, get the pleasure of telling - in this case - the entertainment industry to go stuff it. The supreme court has repeatedly refrained from supporting this sort of thing, and they're unlikely to start in the future. Even if the worst happens, and this thing gets passed, the courts will strike it down long before the bureaucracy finds a way to start enforcing it. It's highly unlikely to affect any of us.<p>Some other commenters have almost correctly pointed out that ""they're not going to give up"" - because in many cases, fighting for these inane laws is their day job. First, there's also a group of people whose day job is to argue these sorts of laws. And another group whose day job is to strike them down, _even if_ the opposition is poorly argued. Second, those lobbyists are likely to be loosing their jobs soon as the industry paying for them begins to fall apart.<p>So, please. Stop freaking out every time one part of the government does something stupid. Writing to your local dimwit to point out the obvious: ok.

They are great birds but I don't think they make great pets after all.<p>(I'd elaborate but it's more fun just to refer you to RMS, who is completely correct on this subject. I didn't read the rest of his note, though, so he may be less correct on other subjects. ;)<p>Having said that: Just as birds are ""meant"" to fly around all the time, so are humans ""meant"" to spend most of their lives without sitting, run long distances across equatorial plains in bare feet, live in bands of perhaps a dozen or two individuals, teach their children how to find, identify, and possibly eat hundreds of varieties of wild plant, periodically endure starvation, cope with a wide variety of exciting parasites inside and out, and occasionally get attacked by wild creatures. And though at one time or another various people have become fanatical about recreating one (presumed) aspect of our early environment or another -- ranging from barefoot running to the ""paleo"" diet -- humans do in fact live full and happy lives in modern cities, or in the Arctic Circle. We're quite adaptive.<p>Parrots are also quite adaptive. Like dogs, their main concern is that they live just as the <i>flock</i> does. In a home the flock, of course, is you and any other creatures that happen to be around. Parrots are pretty happy so long as they're around people and doing what the people are doing. My parrot can fly, but does not do so often; when he is out of his cage, he generally flies only to get closer to me, and then only when I refuse to heed his calls to come closer to <i>him</i>.<p>But I agree that all parrots would be even happier living in flocks in outdoor flight cages, of a size ranging from eight feet wide to, well, infinity.

Amazon grew to its current size by exploiting shift to on-line purchasing but today they're big enough to start taking advantage of their size. Walmart conquered U.S. with lower prices but Amazon can offer even better prices because they don't have to operate physical stores with staff, just warehouses. Amazon is not done until they have a warehouse for each Walmart store, Best Buy store etc. and their competitive advantage grows with every warehouse they build.<p>And when there are more Amazon's warehouse than Starbucks, there's international market to conquer.<p>Additionally Bezos has shown that he's very comfortable competing aggressively, running the business at the edge of profitability, which makes sense if you think that Amazon's ultimate ambition is to drive every other merchant out of business by offering lower prices and become the Merchant Of Everything.",1319677722

It's inconvenient to have the Intel reference manuals while working in an AT&T environment, especially for instructions that are quite different (ie: compare Intel vs. AT&T syntax for the LEA instruction). Intel is really the only architecture, at least now, where there's such a large difference in assembly language syntax -- for the same architecture, most platforms typically only differ in minor areas like expressing relocations. In a way AT&T is also quite a departure from other assembly syntaxes too as most have the convention that the destination register is on the left side.",1319677201

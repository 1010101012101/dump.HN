He lost interest quickly, but then I picked up a manual.<p>When I look back at how focused I was then, I feel envy. I would just say ""I am going to write a program that does my Latin homework"" and <i>actually deliver</i>. Of course not with professional results, but credible attempts for someone not even in their teens, working only in Applesoft BASIC.<p>But I had no idea that what I was doing was valuable or unusual. I had no friends or teachers who thought it was even interesting. I just thought I had a weird hobby. Which is why it was easy to quit. In pre-university classes, I found the programming courses boring and felt I was nothing like anybody who was taking those courses. So I turned my back on it and went for journalism and graphic design. It wasn't until the internet went mainstream in a big way that I found a tribe of programmers I could identify with.<p>When I look back on my early years programming (from 10 to 14 or so), I also feel jealous for how un-self-conscious I was. I just did whatever I wanted. For instance, I produced hundreds of little programs to make pretty pictures with math. As an adult I struggle to reconcile my aesthetic and technical sides.",1285052064

Educators opposed it.  It took a state wide vote to make the change.  Parents couldn't simply select this approach for their child.<p>And lo and behold, kids did better and educators were surprised.<p>Its a simple matter for folks to make dozens of decisions every day about their kids, selecting from many competing options.

1711750,comment,1711725,1711725,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"> Please tell me where things went wrong.<p>Among other things, you've failed to demonstrate that Obama believes Capitalism is inherently exploitative. Even if you'd managed that, you'd still need to prove that he also supports the other tenets of Marxism, like the one I called out in my comment.<p>A person is not automatically a Marxist merely for having some affinity to any part of the overall philosophy. Instead, one is a Marxist if the overall body of their philosophy matches. Obama has never advocated the a revolution of the proletariat, one of the core ideas of Marxism. There is also no evidence that he sees Capitalism as inherently exploitative, nor that he endorses the view that a person is exploited if they produce more than they consume. To the extent that he has supported policies to enhance equality of well-being, they have mostly been aimed at shoring up a necessary minimum level of well-being via taxes, not by transferring the means of production from the bourgeois to the proletariat.<p>For these reasons and many others, it is completely misguided to call him a Marxist. Say rather that he has implemented some economic policies that would be vaguely similar to a small subset of the policies that a Marxist leader might implement. Better still, say nothing at all; you have demonstrated that you are not qualified in either duty to truth nor possession of knowledge to comment.",1285051901

1711744,comment,1710702,1711600,0,0,dasil003,,,"That's certainly interesting research, but it's far from conclusive.  There are all manner of variables such as the accuracy of the mouse actions required, the number of keystrokes required, the familiarity of the user with the commands, and even the quality of the mouse.<p>The tests that Apple conducted were based on simple tasks available on the Macintosh computers of the time.  However, text editing is a complex task with a lot of room for optimization.  There is no doubt that more keypresses can be achieved per second than mouse actions, and that if asked to repetitively perform a task that could be accomplished by means of 10 vim key strokes or some combination of 5 text selections and menu choices, the max speed of the vim'er would top out higher than the mouser.<p>However true it is that the keyboarder forgets the time spent recalling arcane commands, it's also true that experienced vim'ers can issues multiple commands per second, some of which will do things that would not reasonably contained in a convenient location in a menu and/or icon-based interface.  The powerful grammar and compositional nature of vi commands alluded to in this article, combined with the patterns that emerge in working with specific programming languages lead to opportunities to develop extremely efficient editing skills that blow a mouse-based workflow out of the water.  It's not just my own experience, it's watching other people do things in vi or emacs that I guarantee are impossible with a mouse.<p>You may well be right that the improved productivity of vi/emacs is exaggerated by its practitioners, but I don't think there's really a case to be made that advanced keyboard editing is a waste of time.",1285051734

You'd move to the line you want by using a search (or '{', which moves to empty lines), start your selection with V, and move to the end with another search (or some kind of movement command that gets you where you want to go quickly).""<p>I invented the following task for myself: With the cursor on a blank line above 4 lines of text followed by a blank line, copy the 4 lines and paste them so that there is a buffer of 2 blank lines between the 4 lines of text and their duplicates.  I did the task 4 times in both gedit and vim, restarting whenever I screwed up (which was quite often).  Here are my results.<p>vim: 18.28s
gedit: 14.45s<p>I discarded an earlier task that I think Vim might have been doing better on because the task ended with the buffer back where it started, and I wasn't sure I was able to count accurately while performing the task.  However, I had practiced with Vim on that task to the point where my movements were purely mechanical, and I was typing characters nearly as fast as I'm typing these words now.<p>It's probably a better idea to relax while doing these tasks instead of racing through them, as I'm generally relaxed when I code, but I still don't see much promise in Vim at this point.<p>As a side note, why is it that I'm the only one doing tests on myself?

The purpose of education is to move the characters ""United States"" from a low position on a piece of paper to a location higher up.<p>It is in fact very difficult to come up with a good through definition of the purpose of school, as it varies greatly from person to person and from time to time.  My definition changes daily, though I don't think the school system has changed their definition in 100+ years (whatever it may be - basically ""mold well-rounded citizens"", or better yet, ""create consumers who don't cause trouble"").<p>How would you define it?<p>I believe it encompasses the following:<p>1.  Creating free thinking people.  What does this mean?<p>a.  Someone who knows themselves.  Who can draw strength from themselves, and isn't afraid of facing their own thoughts when they are alone.  This is also someone who naturally would have to be conscious of this particular ""self"" - something I don't believe a majority are.<p>b.  Someone who is somewhat versed in debate and rhetoric.  Someone who can understand arguments, break them down, and can form opinions and rebuttals.  This is essential in today's world as we are bombarded with opinions on all sides and often don't know what to think.  We naturally conform to the opinions around us when we don't have ones ourselves and don't have what I outlined in a).  In addition, this helps us understand the ways in which we are manipulated.<p>c.  Someone who understands the ""6 Levels of Moral Development"" by Lawrence Kohlberg, or something similar to this.  Someone who can see this and contrast it to their own lives.<p>2.  Ensuring a basic level of competency in topics that we come into contact on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.<p>3.

At the final exam, those one for get the degree, we told him that we wanted to do a online startup to begin creating jobs in our country, learn great things and be proactives, we argued if Mark Zuckerberg did, why we didn't?. He answered ""Place yourself in your context, this is Mexico and there are nobody who has done something like this, please be realistics.""<p>I honestly can understand his thoughs, because he's a person who finished his Master Degree in the same school he studied his career, he never got a job in the industry and by the same, he didn't know anything about what's going on this daily-changing world called internet.<p>I have several things to share here, and also i have my own answer about why the schools aren't working anymore. Why humans created schools? universities and specialized courses of some science? Because they noted if you start giving ""education"" to people they will be useful for industries and they will generate wealth, and that was true 70 years ago, -ie i've studied as part of Computer Engineer career a subject called ""logical circuits"" where we built some circuits with some logic gates, and using a protoboard. I really hated these stuff, but if i imagine myself studying these topic 70 years ago, I would be surely fascinated.<p>Today is another history, a history where driven-knowledge is to a few clicks, and where you can learn as fast as you  want, a history where knowledge six months ago is no longer profitable,a history where you cannot wait to get information from another guy who calls himself a professor but it really does not love their job, but by money. You cannot depend of what are you learning using such a valuable resource like time from a stranger who doesn't care about what you love to do. We need to start creating yesterday, and the future is today.<p>I think schools need to change the way educate people, because just give knowledge with non sense of application kind of useless(some psychologists
says the knowledge is better developed by practicing
not just reading or listening), and i personally consider a waste of time these behavior, because we forget knowledge pretty much everything if we don't use it, and also we didn't really own knowledge at all, sometimes it's just an act of imitating your teacher trying to get a high note.<p>Intelligence is the ability to solve problems, and repeating some old stuff doesn't solve nothing but high average in school.<p>From the other hand, i think internet is such a great tool to start building real knowledge of almost anything, we can search from how to find the g point to build a molotov bomb in  a few clicks away. Internet is such an amazing way of share experiential knowledge and give value to other people like HackerNews, somo other tools like Quora, StackOverflow and more to come. We can connect people with the same ideology or same musical preferences. I find my first paid work using Internet, i met my actual girlfriend from internet, i know almost all i do from here, the internet, i'm sharing what i'm learning in a blog post, i've built a community for Mexican and Latin American Android Developers.

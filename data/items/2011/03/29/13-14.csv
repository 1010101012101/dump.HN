They're quite clearly following the Apple/iTunes/iPod strategy: ""Get the software pieces out there and performing so integration with the final hardware is seamless and painless"".<p>So the fact that it duplicates some parts of existing software doesn't much matter.  What matters is whether it's a focused and refined first-party solution for that eventual device.<p>It simply isn't competing for the people who know about and downloaded and set up an account for Dropbox/Grooveshark/etc.  It would be the built-in feature that's sitting there waiting for you, automatically integrated to your existing Amazon account and ""Just Works"".<p>Also, the small size seems (to me) to be a beta sort of limitation. I'd be surprised if the final hardware launch doesn't include an upgrade to 50 or more gig of space just for buying the hardware.<p>So, yes, it really is just a sort of Grooveshark/Dropbox/iTunes-Cloud-Sync sort of solution that doesn't knock anyone's socks off via the feature checklist.

Inevitably there will be subsets of the community who feel their needs aren't being met on HN.<p>For example, if HN has 99 employees for every one founder, what do you think will happen if you try to discuss how to set up options and vesting such that in a liquidity event, the employees are still bound to the company and won't quit when they discover they have new bosses?<p>You aren't going to get the same conversation as if you just discuss the question with other founders. I'm not saying the HN discussion will be less valuable, but can we agree that some conversations will be different?",1301405207

2382477,comment,2382135,2382275,3,0,kls,,,"Right to me personally I think maintaining a version of an external project is the less ideal of the two. I personally think Monkey Patching is a very elegant solution to modifying 3rd party code that should be treated like a black box. It keeps third party code and internal code cleanly separated and if the maintainers then patch their code it becomes very easy to go in and pull your monkey patches out when the problem has been addressed. Managing the versioning dependencies for an entire project just to keep a patch set seems like overkill to me when generally you only need to modify a few lines of code in an entire project.<p>For example, my company is working on a huge web project for IBM right now, it is a Javascript based front end, in which we use Dojo as the toolkit. It would be safe to say that there are more lines of Javascript code than Gmail has in this project and yet our Monkey Patch files probably consist of less than 20 lines of code. It would be overkill to maintain a branch of Dojo for those 20 lines of code, especially given the fact that most of the patches are to customize Dojo to do things the way we want it too and not true bugs. So they have no hope of making it back into Dojo proper. With Monkey Patching we just maintain our own Monkey Patch files along with our code base. We just upgraded the project from 1.5 to 1.6 which if we would have been maintaining our own version, it would not have been a 30 minute process.<p>That being said, if a developer is Monkey Patching his own or internal code, it should serve as a red flag that they may be doing something wrong.",1301405202

2382458,comment,2374194,2380722,1,0,JanezStupar,,,">It is a fallacy to say that we cannot improve living conditions for the entire human populace without increasing power consumption. They are not conflicting goals.<p>Huh? How do you propose increasing standard of living for 70% of worlds population that currently uses way less than you or me or our US cousins? ( Total Energy consumption per capita: US 87KWh, EU 40KWh, China 18KWh, India 6KWh, The World Average=6.6KWh). Unless you try to argue that standard of living has nothing to do with energy consumption or even that 3rd world people have higher standard of living than we do?<p>>It is a fallacy to say that the standard of living must devolve for all those in the western world to the 1950s era levels, to support improvement for the other 80% of the human populace.<p>It is? If we freeze the quota of produced energy - then we have turned energy market into a zero sum market. Thus any increase of consumption by one party is counterbalanced by decrease of another. The 50's and 80% is indeed wrong - since I just used them as arbitrary placeholders. Please don't expect me to go on a 10year research, just due to an internet argument.<p>>You are drawing conclusions based on that fallacy to claim that I am dishonest and lacking in perspective. It is a fallacy to claim any percentage forfeit is necessary to improve living conditions.<p>You haven't provided a single proof of your claims. You just keep spinning your make-believe story. Also I didn't say you're dishonest AND lacking in perspective. I said that you are either - but you might as well be both.<p>>You may believe that it is painless to find additional power sources, but the power sources you advocate have already been found and demonstrated as not painless.<p>Its your delusion that there are painless or negative side effect free power sources. Those used currently are used since in fact they (due to various reasons) ARE the LEAST painful of known options. Also for nuclear power we by now know very well what the negative side effects are (under what circumstances).<p>What you're lobbying for has only plans - like some very smart people predicted we would be on Mars in 40 years. I certainly believe that all solar, wind, water and trees society is possible. But we need to get by until we get there.<p>Regarding my belief regarding energy consumption of living beings... The whole universe is trying to equalize its energy potentials (the entropy) and life is just one of mechanisms that helps to dissipate them. So any life at all, now matter how green and how much it tries to not eat animals (instead eating imported papayas?) it will contribute to the untimely thermic death of the universe.",1301404861

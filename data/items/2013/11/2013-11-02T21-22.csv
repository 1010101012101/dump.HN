6661008,comment,6659583,6660897,2,0,MichaelGG,,,"Both of which have been in F# for years, and C# re-implemented them later, poorly. F#&#x27;s dynamic is extensible (and around since 2007? 2008? earlier?)). If you wanted to implement a &quot;dynamo&quot; object, go ahead. If you want loosely typed CSV-reader access, go ahead. (You get the ? and ?<- operators to define as you&#x27;d like.)<p>C#&#x27;s async comes from F#&#x27;s async (available since Oct 2007), which in F# is <i>just a library</i>. That&#x27;s because F# supports workflows aka computation expressions aka warm fuzzy things. What F# does as a library feature, C# requires baking into the compiler.<p>So for 5 years now, MS has added these two features. They&#x27;ve still yet to deliver a REPL, or finish implementing type inference, or any such stuff. It looks like Anders Hejlsberg, the main C# designer, seems more interested in adding some basic features to JavaScript, lately. C# seems fairly abandoned, <i>language-wise</i>, to me. They seem to be content to have put Java in its place, and leave it at that.<p>P.S. C#&#x27;s a great language, and I&#x27;m not trying to insult the people that have done great work on it. As a popular language, it&#x27;s one of the nicest ones out there IMO.",1383429535
6661007,comment,6659091,6660891,1,0,DannyBee,,,"There are a couple reasons to put it on the intake side:<p>1. Otherwise you are pulling dust particles directly into the fan bearings/etc (though it may be that you don&#x27;t have a good enough seal for this to matter anyway).  All this does is lower the life of the fan.  This is one of the reasons you see filters on the intake side of an A/C or furnace - to protect the innards.<p>2. If a non-dust particle gets dropped into the fan, with the 
filter on the outtake side, it is likely to get propelled through the filter at high speed.  With the filter on the intake side, this will never happen (since it would not hit the filter), and even dropping it near the rear of the filter is unlikely to cause damage.<p>(There are other reasons that would matter more if this was an enclosed ventilation system, but it isn&#x27;t)<p>Note that without pre-filtering, i can&#x27;t imagine these filters are really lasting that long without being cleaned.  Are you measuring static pressure increase at all to see how long they last before needing to replaced?<p>HEPA filters are not usually meant to be sole filters and last a long time. They are just too fine and load too quickly.  Some form of coarse separation (IE >5 micron particles) is usually necessary to get any real life out of them.",1383429497

I think a lot of people read papers in their fields with an eye to how the paper will help them achieve their own goals. When the problem is so abstracted from what you care about, it&#x27;s difficult to stay motivated & absorb the material. I imagine a lot of people put up with that paper solely because of the reputation of the author.<p>I also think Lamport overstates his success with formulating the Byzantine generals problem in terms of Byzantine generals. I know the problem as the Byzantine generals problem, but think of it in terms of computers, not generals. It&#x27;s just easier to understand the problem that way, the generals stuff just gets in the way. iirc my distributed systems textbook (Lynch) did not actually formulate the problem in terms of generals, but I could be misremembering.",1383429294

As a .NET developer you can often feel alienated because of the platform you build on.<p>About a year ago, I picked up Python because I wanted to build a site using Django. I decided to fire up my Ubuntu VM, and work my way through the official tutorial. The language was easy enough to pick up and within a day I finished the tool I was building. However, I would have finished it in half the time if I was working on Windows. As much as I love the Terminal, my main time-sink was getting used to working in Linux again. After two hours I ended up downloading PyCharm because Eclipse was as awful as I remember it from my Java days (I downloaded Eclipse because using a text-editor was so slow!). I know some fantastic C# developers, but if they wanted to work in Ruby, Python, or any other language outside of the .NET framework I bet that most of them would struggle; not with the language, but with the tooling and Linux.<p>I absolutely love .NET and C#, and I&#x27;m very happy working with them, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of being restricted.

6660985,comment,6659951,6660547,24,0,mikeash,,,"You misunderstand the purpose of signatures. Their main purpose is not identity verification, but rather <i>solemnization</i>. It is a formal act in which you acknowledge the document that you are signing. This is why you can sign with an X and it&#x27;s still perfectly legal, even though an X is trivially forgeable. Conversely, this is why serious transactions require notarized signatures: with the notary, you are then able to establish identity.<p>This project is not strictly necessary, because an electronic signature can simply be a button, or a text field (I&#x27;ve seen both before). This is just as binding as a physical signature, which is to say that it demonstrates your intent to be bound, but does not actually establish your identity by itself.

Laws are blunt objects that come with their own enforcement costs and unintended consequences.  We should be especially wary about regulations whose benefits are sharply concentrated among a small group (say, hotel owners), and whose drawbacks (say, slightly higher hotel costs for everyone else) are widely dispersed.  That&#x27;s standard public choice theory.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that no regulations are ever justifiable (far from it!), but it does suggest that we not favor regulation for the sake of regulation.<p>I don&#x27;t like to psychologize people, but I wonder whether this attitude is a sort of mental heuristic on the left, which often finds itself fighting with folks on the right who seem to believe, roughly, that regulation is intrinsically bad, and should be abolished.  This has encouraged the counter-formation of the view that regulation is intrinsically good, and should be preserved.

For instance, C# has crazy duck-typing rules, but they only apply when using certain keywords (like new Whatever{} or foreach). Or all of C#&#x27;s type-coercion stuff, like C. Floats, integers, even strings - let&#x27;s implicitly convert them galore!<p>F# has a fairly coherent model, which makes most of the design principles deducible. For instance, that quote about DefaultValue. You&#x27;re using a keyword to introduce a field without initialization. Since F# avoids uninitialized fields, so you don&#x27;t end up with nulls, it forces you to be explicit here, noting that you&#x27;re requesting the compiler to allow an uninitialized field, which is not something you often want.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s marketing is shit as far as F# goes. They&#x27;ve invested a lot in C#, and it&#x27;s embarrassing for some people to admit that MSR came up with a far superior language. So instead they mumble about how F# is <i>great</i>... if you&#x27;re like a rocket scientist or quant or like, really super-duper smart. The implication being that C#/VB are the only practical languages for normal get-stuff-done programmers. In truth, the only real advantage C# has is the tooling. There are drag-n-drop designers, and codegen tools that F# doesn&#x27;t have. Some libraries make implicit assumptions about C# compiler implementation details. But that&#x27;s hardly a language problem, and something MS could fix if they cared to put resources on it.<p>As a side note, the F# team has some of the same people responsible for actually designing and getting proper generics into the CLR.

6660814,comment,6659583,6659583,13,0,alkonaut,,,"I think the analysis leaves out the most important aspects for non-C#/.NET developers. My analysis:<p>C#, the language:<p>Pros:<p>* The most elegant of this family of languages (statically typed curly bracket imperative).<p>* If you are coming from C++: C# is Feature rich but still not too large to make it &quot;choose your own sublanguage&quot; like C++ (yet). You can actually learn this \nlanguage from the inside out. There are few undefined implementation details and quite few quirks.<p>* The tooling is fantastic if you can agree to using windows and shell out some money.<p>Cons:<p>* It was designed to rival C++ and Java with a nice learning curve for C++/Java devs. If it was designed today, I think it would have a lot more modern/functional features built in such as tuple deconstruction, algebraic data types/pattern matching (instead of Null) and so on. Now when you use F#, C# feels old with its only half-decent type inference, null keyword and so on.<p>* Performance (This is actually more .NET than C#): While it <i>can</i> be quite performant, <i>idiomatic</i> C# is still often quite slow. Especially in the hands of non experienced developers. There are often hidden allocations and boxing calls that are hidden behind syntax sugar, that end up taxing the garbage collector (example: A simple foreach call often allocates an object which later gets eligible for GC). So writing high performance code is <i>possible</i> in C# but still very hard. You&#x27;ll find yourself either making the code look like C (for example: arrays of structs rather than lists of objects which was the idiomatic solution), or simply calling to C/C++ for performance sensitive bits. In comparison to C++ for high performance code, I&#x27;d say C# offers free reliability/conciseness etc., and you have to struggle with perf. With C++ you&#x27;d get a lot of perf for free because idiomatic C++ is fast (array of structs may well be an idiomatic solution!), but instead you may struggle with leaks, overruns, token salad... Bottom line: C# can often be as fast as C++ but when it is, it&#x27;s no easier than just using C++ because you have to make allocation free code basically (which is HARD, especially as an afterthougt).<p>.NET, the platform:<p>Pros:<p>* It feels like they looked at java and just corrected a lot of the problems. Sane dependency/versioning is just one example.<p>* The community is very much alive. Stackoverflow has become the center of it in later years.<p>* Frameworks evolve at a stunning pace. If you blink you missed two versions of ASP.NET MVC.<p>Cons:<p>* Same as above. Hard to keep up with things if you aren&#x27;t working full time on it. The webpage you did last week is now two frameworks away from the latest \nversion. You spend a lot of time upgrading code to newer frameworks.<p>* The GAC is a horrible implementation of a good idea. The fact that you can&#x27;t really use signing in a useful way without it also feels like a mistake.<p>* The free versions of everything (compiler, IDE, servers..) feel like second class citizens. You can&#x27;t code up a prototype webpage in the latest framework and \nexpect it to run on an OSS server under linux. It&#x27;s hard to know <i>what</i> subset of language/tools/frameworks actually work under e.g. Apache+Mono. A clear disadvantage compared to Node/Python etc.<p>* It feels like Microsoft has a bit of a weird relationship with .NET, or rather, it feels like the OS division of microsoft never really accepted .NET while it has stayed the pet of DevDiv. The worse examples has been the slow death of Silverlight (I can see how it should die, but the silence from microsoft has been remarkable). Now it also seems that MS don&#x27;t really have a plan for how .NET should be a first class citizen for both desktop and &quot;modern&quot; application development under Win8, instead pushing C++.

I don&#x27;t know if pin pads actually do this, but it&#x27;s possible.

People think it&#x27;s the signature that matters because that is what they see.  It isn&#x27;t.  What matters is that the signature provides some <i>evidence</i> about the intent of a particular person at a particular time.  A physical signature on a physical document provides such evidence.  An electronic signature does not and cannot.<p>BTW, even physical signatures have pitfalls.  They bind only to the single sheet of paper they are actually on.

I mean people who use F# were hired not because they knew F# well but for other skills - e.g. deep knowledge of finance, distributed computing etc. Why not focus on learning that instead? Nobody pays 100k for F# alone. I might be wrong but I just don&#x27;t see it as a skill that sets you apart that much. People are more interested in HTML5 :(.",1383426251

Contrary to what the evangelists&#x27; tell us, process has small (I&#x27;d almost say minimal) influence on software development failure or success.<p>The responsibility is on the lead project manager. He&#x27;s not been good enough. A failure on a project of this size doesn&#x27;t just happen overnight. If you just look, you can see it coming from miles away.<p>The solution will always be highly uncomfortable though. You&#x27;d have to stand up to powerful people who hold authority over you, fire sub-contractors or employees, significantly reduce scope, move deadlines. Big, high impact actions that won&#x27;t be popular, hell they might even get you fired. Not a job for the faint of heart for sure.<p>It&#x27;s depressingly typical of big corporations and organizations, to allow people not capable enough to be put in charge of such large projects. And it&#x27;s even more depressing knowing tax dollars are being wasted in such huge amounts on relatively (big emphasis) simple software.",1383426131

There are basically no landline connections in large parts of Africa, since it&#x27;s basically infeasible to cover the large distances involved with cables. Satellite is unaffordable for all practical purposes - when I&#x27;m talking about doctors and nurses I&#x27;m not talking about western foreign aid people but locals. If your average income is in the range of single digit USD a day, satellite comm is infeasible. Also, the communication system must be manageable and maintainable by locals with a basic eduction.<p>So the best available communication is often cellular, if any.<p>On the other hand malaria is a disease that only affects some parts of the population - namely the one that lives in malaria affected regions. Large parts of southern Africa are mosquito-free, hence no Malaria. To make up for that there&#x27;s a ton of others diseases, so if you eliminate Malaria, you still have to fight Schistosomiasis [1], Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) [2] HIV and a lot of other diseases for which treatments may or may not exist. In a country where the average infection rate with HIV hovers at about 30% the gain from eradicating Malaria is limited at best. Let&#x27;s not get into poverty and access to most basic health care.<p>It&#x27;s not a simple problem that allows for a simple solution and even eliminating every conceivable disease that affects people in developing countries will only be one minor factor to improving the situation there. Those people need access to knowledge and information as much as they need health care and water. Otherwise they&#x27;ll forever be stuck on western subsidies - just healthier and longer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis</a>",1383426004

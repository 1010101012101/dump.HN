What makes you happy?",,"I initially started Satismetrics to solve a problem I had, and I’d like to find out if others could also benefit from a product/service like this:<p>http://satismetrics.com<p>Short Version: send your happiness as a score by email (comments optional) whenever you like, data collected for you to analyse.<p>Long Version (with background):<p>My happiness fluctuates massively week-by-week; sometimes it’s silly little things that can make me unhappy for days, and sometimes when I get in the office and I’m happy, I forget what made me happy in the first place!<p>I started writing down what made me happy, or unhappy, and when. Happy things for me include motivational songs coming on the radio, a compliment from a colleague, excitement about seeing an old friend later on, etc. Unhappy things for me often include unrealistic deadlines being set, team members being lamented for no good reason, some bad news on TV, etc.<p>My aim in writing these things down was to be able to become happy again when I get sad. From my ratings, I can quickly find out what song to play or what inspirational article to re-read or video to re-watch, and it does work! I’m magically happy again. I think lots of people do this already, but they probably have a better memory than me!<p>It’s all about aiming to prevent/avoid things which previously made me unhappy, and do more of the things that previously made me feel happy. I can also identify if I need to make a change in my life. By tracking my happiness every day (sometimes multiple times per day) I’ve been able to make some pretty big decisions such as changing city and job, moving nearer to my old friends. Not only do I reckon I feel happier overall, but I can now see it as a metric and justify my decisions on paper.<p>I’d love to get some feedback from the HN community, to find out if anyone else shares my problem and would be interested in joining my private beta in January.<p>Some quick things to point out:\n1) I’ve only just found a similar site by Googling a few keywords, but it looks more like a research project.\n2) I’m not crazy about the name.\n3) At this point I’m simply aiming to validate an idea, and I'd love your feedback, good and bad.<p>Thanks in advance!",1325347138

You can't develop a company culture without putting people together, physically.<p>If your goal is simply finish executing on that spec, and if you see workers simply as a resource to be optimized, then you're right and remote workers are the cheaper, more efficient way to go.<p>But if, on the other hand, what you're building is the company itself: a team of smart, like-minded people who like each other and work well together, there's no substitute for physical proximity. Happy hours, being able to <i>see</i> what everybody else is working on, and working alongside everybody else with delivery pizza at 9pm when in crunch mode… these are things that build camaraderie between team members. It's similar to a group of soldiers in the trenches: you need to know that your fellow soldiers are your friends, and that they've got your back.<p>The whole is more than the sum of its part.

Even so, the prices do drop on console - very rarely do you see a $70 game keep that price, they generally settle to the $15-$25 mark over the course of a year (with a few exceptions). $5 barely breaks even the manufacturing costs so it's no surprise they don't want to sell at that rate. In any case, $15-25 is affordable pocket-money territory for kids.<p>The problem here is immediacy. Even with savage price drops, games are notoriously short-tailed. Gamers want them as soon as they come out, not a moment later. BEFORE they come out if possible - leaks are massively popular.

Pragmatically, I can't help noticing that the elected representatives in the House of Commons often seem incapable of organising a piss-up in a brewery or showing any empathy whatsoever for their constituents, while the Lords actually has a fairly respectable track record for getting in the way of bad legislation.

Apparently there is some doubt as to whether Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia actually wrote the e-mail in question.  Here is the full text of the article, taken from <a href=""http://smagula.org/?q=aggregator/sources/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smagula.org/?q=aggregator/sources/7</a> :<p>30 December 2011 - 9:27pm<p>First my email to Jimmy<p>Hi Jimmy,<p>I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Reddit is capable of doing giant things, GoDaddy for example. But it seems as if the internet is only boycotting GoDaddy because they (godaddy) actually rely on the internet that they are ruining for profits. There are a great number of posts on reddit calling for action and a larger boycott of all the companies backing SOPA, but they are getting lost in the static. So I ask you to write one more personal appeal calling for action. As a internet celebrity of sorts, and a figurehead for free speech I feel as if your words would be taken less lightly and people across the globe might get on the same page so to speak.<p>Thanks for everything you do, a concerned internet addict.<p>And his reply:<p>I think it's worth taking a step back and thinking about what we can accomplish and how we can win this thing. The boycott and back down of Go Daddy was important - it got the Internet community organized to start doing something. But the support of one company doesn't make or break SOPA - indeed, the support of whatever companies doesn't make or break SOPA - what does is awakening the general public and activating them to call, write, or visit their Congressperson.<p>Many of the companies on the list of supporters do, in fact, have legitimate beefs with the current situation. Particularly for companies like Chanel, Coach, Juicy Couture, etc. - they face a daily problem with counterfeit merchandise sold via foreign websites. Boycotting them would be counter-productive because they are rightly considered by the public to be victims here.<p>My issue is not with working to crack down on counterfeit goods, trademark infringement, copyright infringement, etc. My issue is that the bill attempts to do so in a way that is inconsistent with the First Amendment and that the bill is technologically incompetent.<p>A boycott against companies who are not tech companies (and who therefore, unlike Go Daddy, can't be expected to understand the technical issues) in this context runs the risk of the entire anti-SOPA movement being branded unfairly as not caring about the real problems.<p>So Go Daddy backed down - and Congress watched that play out. The next thing is not to hammer on other companies, but to hammer on Congress directly. I've been told that if I can get 30,000-40,000 people to call or write their Congressional representative, it will have an impact. My view is that 30,000-40,000 is easy. We should be aiming much higher.<p>But to do that we have to get people off their butts to do the right thing. A lot of people! I think we can!<p>--Jimbo<p>Wise words.<p>I can submit a screenshot for proof if need be.",1325345107

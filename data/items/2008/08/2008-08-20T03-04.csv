281174,comment,280118,280385,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"silentbicycle also recommended the Little Schemer books. But for me personally, while they may work for you or someone else... I found that they didn't work for me. Not to say that I have a weight problem, but I love food and food is the theme throughout these books. I like to watch my weight and my sense of control with food is not that stellar; and about three-quarters of the way through the book I realized I wasn't going to make it through to the end or with the sequel: Seasoned Schemer. The food they use to bring their concepts full circle just don't do it for me. Thus, I'm yet another one for SICP or PG's book.<p>I always recommend Applications Programming in ANSI C by Johnsonbaugh if you're interested in learning C. It's got a great scientific and engineering theme.<p>While I'm not sure about your area of the world, I know that in my area books at the bricks & mortar stores are ridiculously expensive. Thus, I always do my book buying at places like Amazon and I suggest you do too.. especially if the book you're looking for in the Borders store doesn't carry your desired book. I find the stores like Barnes & Noble to be great places for eye candy... exploring the books they have, sitting in their comfy chairs and making notes on the books I'm going to buy online later. :)<p>Best of luck to you!",1219204497

281171,comment,280889,280983,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> <i>prohibit driving after the age of 75</i><p>I, for one, would welcome that. The unpredictability of elderly drivers is every bit as dangerous as the stupidity of inexperienced ones. I saw an elderly man take out 8-10 of those construction barrels the other day just because he drifted over a bit out of his lane. Thank god no one was working that day.<p>I agree that we should have the freedom to take risks, but one has to weigh the risks taken with the lives of others. An 18 year-old that drinks alcohol is primarily a risk to himself, whereas a 75 year-old that is physically unfit to handle a vehicle is only one step away from a drunk driver.<p>I find it amusing that we have all these laws to protect ourselves from, well, ourselves, and yet we don't do obvious things like determine if someone is physically fit enough to operate a vehicle in public.<p>My problem with MADD and the whole debate is that somehow the drinking age got attached to drunk driving. Last I checked, there was no minimum age at which driving while intoxicated becomes illegal. It's <i>always illegal</i>. Regardless of the drinking age, drunk drivers should be punished severely.<p>For that reason, (and the cookies argument pointed out by someone else here), I think the age should be lowered to 16 or so. (I'm 25, and I feel more strongly about this now than I did at 18.) Let kids have their first experiences with alcohol with their families, which are more likely to instill some responsible habits. At the same time, I think drunk drivers should be punished more severely, including the use of public shaming (in additions to fines/loss of license/jail time).",1219204361

As someone who is looking for a good hacker to team up with on an iPhone (+ server side) project, I have a few observations:<p>1) Although being too secretive about a project isn't usually a good thing, I don't really want to plaster my idea on a site, either.<p>2) I think another (more controversial) approach to solving the 'co-founder problem' would be to create a database of users populated with answers to questions similar to the YC application form. So, one could filter based on interest level, availability, proximity, etc. Real names would be optional (news.yc user names could be used instead). Think YCombinator meets LinkedIn.<p>The more I write about 2), the more I like it. If I weren't working on another project, I'd implement this myself. In any case, contact me if you want more ideas (see my profile).",1219203975

281156,comment,280795,281114,0,0,breck,,,"Thanks. Fixed the colors. Will look at the line spacing in a sec.<p>The lack of members is the biggest feature. The odds of it turning into the next Reddit/Digg are much lower than the odds of that happening here. :)<p>Seriously, the idea stemmed from the YC meetup last week. PG said that the YC interviews aren't like interviews at all, they just ""Do YC"". If the team and YC seem to click, then they get accepted. I think the same thing applies for finding good cofounders--you just start something and see if the chemistry among the team clicks. I've started projects with friends and complete strangers before, and whether or not I knew them before the project isn't correlated with how well we worked together. There are a few people I met the day of starting a joint project who I'd love to start another company with.<p>That's what I hope this site could do: not just bring hackers together to discuss startups, but bring them together to launch things and find new cofounders.<p>I think there are a lot of people on HN that would be great to work with, and the best way to find them would be to just start projects. I currently am lucky enough to have a few hours free each day, but unlucky that I'm far from the Valley(I've got family commitments that have been keeping me in Southern MA all summer). When I get to the valley, I think it will be easier to find co-founders, but until then it's not that easy.",1219202140

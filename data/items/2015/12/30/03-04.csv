The man&#x27;s tumor cells were shown to have originated from the dwarf tapeworm, Hymenolepis nana, making this a case of parasite-to-host cancer transmission.",1451447991

This concerns me most.<p>We need to carefully consider who exactly controls such a powerful tool and what they use it for. Right now AGI is capital-intensive and risky: you need large-scale computing, top PhDs, and plenty of time. This means that only the most well-heeled organizations can justify earnest AGI development: big tech, government agencies, etc. Those orgs already have plenty of political power, and it seems to me that achieving AGI (or steps toward it) would amplify that power. Perhaps to the point of being unchallengeable.<p>Do we want a political landscape where power is even more concentrated than now?",1451447827

Here&#x27;s my chemistry cred: I&#x27;m married to a chemist, related to a couple more, and have worked in an area related to analytical chemistry, though I got my degree in physics, 2+ decades ago.<p>So here are some generalizations.<p>While in school, I noticed that the physics students were far more interested than the chemistry students, in math and computer stuff. Maybe we were computer science wannabees, or maybe we guessed (correctly in my case) that proficiency with computers would make us more employable. This was true in both undergrad and grad school.<p>And there&#x27;s a long tradition of physicists stealing ideas from math and computation for solving physics problems. When I was in school, computation was considered to be a specialized branch of chemistry, but was at the forefront of physics.<p>Another difference is that the physics students were generally more interested in making our own tools. The current &quot;maker&quot; and &quot;hacker&quot; trends are old hat for small-lab experimental physicists.<p>Chemistry has always been a bigger field than physics, which I suspect has attracted more interest in making commercial equipment and software. I&#x27;ve noticed in an industrial setting, that managers are often looking for closed solutions that can&#x27;t be modified by the user, either for regulatory reasons or adversarial labor-management attitudes. The industry wants your boss to think that letting you make your own tools is either dangerous, or a waste of your time.<p>In contrast, even in industry, physicists still have to make our own tools. And management already knows that we&#x27;re freaks. ;-)<p>So the absence of FOSS tools for chemistry doesn&#x27;t shock me.",1451447632

The need for water per individual hasn&#x27;t changed much in 80 years? 100years? more? The need for electricity has gone up a little since say 1940. Natural gas, and other utilities. Maybe even streets also seem relatively static?<p>But internet? So NYC installs gigi wifi today. In 10 years Korea and Japan and Singapore and China will have tera-wifi or peta-wifi and NYC would likely have nothing. Getting public tech services upgraded at or near the speed that tech accelerates seems highly unlikely. Having public wifi would seem like it would remove a huge incentive for anyone to come in and offer better faster service because competing with free will be hard for a very very long time.<p>Am I wrong?<p>Also, please don&#x27;t devolve this into ISPs suck in America. I fully agree with that statement. I&#x27;m just not sure public wifi is the answer.<p>For example in Japan it was competition that got internet faster in general. Specifically Yahoo/Softbank Japan kept undercutting the competition with faster and cheaper internet and all the other ISPs were forced to respond. That doesn&#x27;t seem to happen in the USA because of poor regulations (local government approved monopolies)<p>I&#x27;m just curious if public wifi is really the correct solution or if it&#x27;s actually going to end up much worse in the long run.",1451447356

Originally Sync data was always encrypted locally with either your Google password or a custom passphrase, and recovery wasn&#x27;t possible (well, practical) absent that passphrase. The result was a bit of a support nightmare, as people would lose their sync data because they changed their account password and forgot the old one, or upgraded their machine and had forgotten the password years before, because it was being autofilled.<p>To solve the problem we ended up changing the way we managed the encryption, so we could recover the data for the default case, and kept the custom passphrase as an opt-in for local-only encryption. That&#x27;s not to say I think we did everything we could to promote and support the use of a custom passphrase, but I am thoroughly convinced that it&#x27;s not something the majority of users are concerned about or want to hassle with. If the average user forgets their password they still want to be able to get their data back (and there&#x27;s no good way to  forewarn or explain away why it won&#x27;t work).",1451447316

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Chen voiced his frustrations regarding patent rights in China. He claimed that Solowheel, his self-balancing unicycle, was copied by other manufacturers after it appeared in Happy Show, a Chinese television show.[6][7] In August 2015, Mark Cuban announced plans to purchase the Hovertrax patents from Chen.[7] Also in 2015, the American company, Inventist, claimed to hold patents and announced its intent to pursue litigation.[8]<p>> The fast pace of the Chinese manufacturing industry makes it difficult to pinpoint which Chinese company was the first to manufacture the device. According to Wired&#x27;s David Pierce, the device was likely invented as the &quot;Smart S1&quot; by Chic Robotics, a Chinese technology company founded in 2013, and associated with Zhejiang University.[4] The Smart S1 was released in August 2014, and found success at the 2014 Canton Fair trade show. The company patented technologies associated with the board, but due to China&#x27;s lax patent enforcement, the product was copied by several Chinese manufacturers.[4]<p>> As of June 2015, the board is made by several knockoff manufacturers in China – a pattern common in the country&#x27;s technology and industrial sector.[9] The copies vary greatly in price and quality, and may exhibit various defects.[4] Most of the boards are produced in mass manufacturing factories in Shenzhen, China.[10] Some newer boards have incorporated Bluetooth speakers, allowing the driver to play music.[11]",1451446738

VC money is increasing, more talented engineers are on the market and more of them are willing to try start ups. You wouldn&#x27;t be renting office in San Francisco (a 2nd rate city with 1st rate cost) competing for a small talent pool against tech giants, and hiring/firing employees cost much less. You can hire a great software engineer (great as in they&#x27;d have no problem passing Google/Facebook interviews and successfully work there) for about $40k USD/year.<p>Market size is also tremendous in China. I remember talking to a Chinese engineer and they told me when they turn on A/B test for features, the small percentage of users that gets hit with the test are numbered in the 10s of millions. When you roll out a startup the adoption numbers are staggering, as in even with low marketing effort it&#x27;s not difficult to see over 100,000 downloads within a week. Silicon Valley started the &quot;fail fast, try again&quot; mentality, and the Chinese has been perfecting it through practice.<p>One last thing that impressed me: The no-bs attitudes and pure capability of these young entrepreneurs. Few of them are worried about generating PR through the Chinese equivalent of TechCrunch, or super worried about upkeeping a pretentious blog with periodic entries of psuedo-philosophical opinion pieces. Many of these guys were super hard working students their entire life, and passed the absurdly rigorous Chinese University Entrance Exam and got into elite schools, and now believe in the hardworking + intelligence > anything else formula.<p>We are going to see a lot interesting things from the Chinese tech scene in the coming decade.",1451445445

For other meanings of your question, see other replies.<p>In (pre-8) Java, <i>variables</i> can only hold <i>primitive values</i> or <i>objects</i> (in Java, an <i>object</i> is an <i>instance</i> of a <i>class</i> [c.f.]).  Similarly, <i>arguments</i> to a <i>method</i> must all be <i>primitive values</i> or <i>objects</i>.<p>This is kinda crazy, by which I mean hilariously limiting.  It&#x27;s often useful to pass around other types of things, including <i>types</i> (in Java that&#x27;d be <i>primitive types</i> or <i>classes</i> or <i>interfaces</i>), or <i>functions</i>, or <i>partially applied functions</i>, or whatever.  Of course, Java doesn&#x27;t have <i>functions</i>, only <i>methods</i>.  Whoops.  See <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-...</a> for a bit of snark about how silly this whole situation is.<p>So Java programmers, while desperately lacking in aesthetic taste (I keed, I keed) and largely blinkered by the java-cultural context in which they find themselves, turn out to be a pretty clever lot after all.  Clever enough that despite their language, they come up with all these conventions for doing things like passing around types and functions and so on.  So you get ideas like the <i>Runnable</i> interface, wherein one makes a class just so that it can have a static method (perhaps called &quot;<i>run</i>&quot;) that does what the function would do, and you then instantiate that class, and pass the instance, just so it can be used to get at the &quot;run&quot; method.  It works, but it&#x27;s oh so ugly.<p>So finally, after twenty years of this suffering, now Java programmers have some nice new syntactic sugar, to allow them to pass functions around with less explicit ceremony, thereby catching up with advanced languages like Python, C, Lisp, and basically everything except Cobol.  Of course, under the hood it&#x27;s still Predicate<T>, a <i>generic type</i> that represents a <i>functional interface</i>, which is a new bit of jargon they came up with to shoehorn this elementary functionality into their baroque conceptual framework.  And you furthermore, in Java 8 you can even declare them anonymously (unlike e.g. C, AFAIK), to expedite the most common use case, which is passing a function as an argument to a <i>higher-order function</i> (like &quot;<i>map</i>&quot; or whatever).  They&#x27;re called &quot;<i>lambdas</i>&quot; because of the existence of the <i>lambda calculus</i>, an abstraction for computing that uses nothing but anonymous functions, and because many other languages have therefore referred to their anonymous function syntax as &quot;<i>lambdas</i>&quot; (Python even uses &quot;lambda&quot; as a keyword for this).<p>So the big deal about lambdas in Java is that Java has one less vile pain point.<p>(Any five-year-old could understand this explanation, right?)",1451444869

It&#x27;s less pronounced in adults suggesting that we get used to it when we realise it&#x27;s not a real threat (CBT).<p>One paper looked at school children near Heathrow Airport vs. in a similar urban area with no air-traffic.

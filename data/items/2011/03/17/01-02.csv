2334776,comment,2333405,2333405,0,0,patio11,,,"My consolidated response:<p>1)  Shortages in Fukushima, etc, are not caused by lack of food or money.  Japan has plenty of food and money.  Japan has a temporary logistics problem with getting food to particular refugee sites, because of a number of issues, most critically that the infrastructure for delivering gas in the east got a severe monkey-wrench thrown into it and it is difficult to truck in enough to do distribution.  With specific reference to Fukushima, the widening of the exclusion zone caused refugees to have to be moved twice is as many days, which also caused some issues.<p>The three closest ports for receiving refined gas got shut down by the tsunami　(along with most local refinery capacity), so it has been getting transported by road from the other side of the country, and that has been hampered by damage to certain roads.  One of those ports will be brought online today.  As that situation gets better, the shortage of supplies for refugees will ease very rapidly.  They're working very hard on that right now.  Aid will not speed that process: any charity chosen at random is not better at doing gas delivery than Japanese gas companies, and no part of the relief efforts is blocking on lack of money.<p>2)  Panic is not helping anyone, and foreign panic is feedback looping right now, particularly in the foreign communities.  The only reason I have talked to the media at all is to stress the importance of them not panicking and not provoking panic.<p>3)  I respect enormously people's desire to help, but satisfying desire to help is a very different thing from actually helping.  The second is very important, the first not so much.<p>I was on a program on the BBC the other day.  Another guest was a foreign aid worker from an organization I will not name.  Host: ""Where are you?""  Him: ""Not quite sure, north of Tokyo.  The map is in Japanese.""  When asked about their plans for doing counseling, he said that they would find somebody locally who speaks English, because in his experience at X disasters across the world there is always somebody, and do counseling through the interpreter.  One could be forgiven for difficulty in finding the value of his organization's assistance at the moment.<p>The US military's response has been invaluable -- choppers are very helpful right now, and have been saving lives.  If you don't come packing your own distribution network designed to function parallel to the civilian ones, your ability to convert any amount of desire into hot meals at a school in eastern Japan is very limited right now.<p>After the immediate situation is addressed, Miyagi, Iwate, and the like will have large reconstruction efforts.  Japan has the political will and resources to handle this.<p>A note: It is a very fluid situation.  My blog post was written on Sunday, 3.5 days ago.  The NYT asked me for a condensed version 2.5 days ago.  Please keep in mind, when you're hearing from anybody (including me), you're hearing something which was true X amount of time ago in a situation evolving very rapidly.",1300327116

2334762,comment,2333537,2333537,0,0,asdfor,,,"Bad implementations of a feature do not make the feature bad as well. If you as a site owner allow for example a password reset based on just answering the secret question, guess what: bad implementation. If you don't inform the users what the secret question can be used for, guess what: bad implementation. If your users choose to use a question that has an answer that can be found easy its the same as having a user use for password the word 'password'. I can go on and on about how you can get something like this wrong.<p>Lets say that my computer gets keyloged and the attacker gets the account/password of site X and my email info aswell. Now the attacker wants to take over both of the accounts. Lets see how things will go if no secret question is involved: At best site X for a password change will require a e-mail confirmation, probably by just providing the old password the attacker will be able to change it. On top of that the site that hosts my  e-mail can't be linked to something else, because of that i guess by simply providing my old password the attacker will get over my e-mail too.<p>HOWEVER if the sites require a secret question/answer verification the attacker wont be able to take over my accounts. And i am able to change both the password and get full control of the accounts.<p>Secret question/answer feature should be treated as a MASTER password. You have your casual password which allows you to identify yourself to the system etc but if you want to change some critical information of the account you will have to provide you master password.<p>If both the site and the user make good use of the feature there is nothing wrong with it.",1300326774

In the longterm, this can be automated with robotics, and not even very difficult ones. Certainly feasible today, if not something a startup can quite just run out and buy.<p>And of course, if they buy a hundred DVDs, why not shortcut the entire process and send a ""cached"" stream? What's the difference between a ""cached"" DVD and a DVD?<p>This is one particular manifestation of something I've been saying for a decade now, which is that like it or not and regardless of the challenges sooner or later the law is going to have to give up the idea that the mechanical source of content has any meaning, because whatever rules you draw can be gamed. The only question you'll ultimately be able to ask is whether you have the rights to view a movie or not.<p>And let me just underline the <i>one particular manifestation</i> bit one more time. Once the kind of people who frequent this site start really thinking about how to game the system in this style you can generate a dozen ideas in an hour, each of which the law really has no current answer to. One immediately obvious example is that if this is legal for DVDs it obviously ought to be legal for CDs, right? Why not a library that takes video of a book two thousand miles away and physically turns pages? (It wouldn't take much post-processing of a video stream to make that feasible.) Why not add caching of the streams to any of those things? If caching in general is wrong, is it OK for me to go ahead and advance the book one page while letting the reader read the previous page, so they don't have to wait for the robot to turn the page laboriously? What if I mix in some P2P, can I stream my neighbor's copy of something?

A quick google says over $100 Billion is a reasonable estimate for online advertising annual spend, as a ballpark figure. Startups are raising say $20 billion [1] a year.<p>Even assuming a large percentage of funding is going to online advertising, we&#x27;re only talking about say a percentage point increase in the size of the ad market. So I think this article is probably incorrect.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/internet-startups-vc-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/internet-startups-vc-2014/</a>",1447667999

10573524,comment,10572863,10573477,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Online ads are here to stay, there is no doubt - in my mind at least - about that. That said, the industry <i>is</i> in trouble, there seems to be a disconnect between the users and the products advertised hitherto unseen and many in the advertising industry are acutely aware of this. Nobody has found a silver bullet on how to fix this and it is only a matter of time before there will be some reaction to this ever decreasing engagement.<p>Making an ad campaign that has a positive ROI is doable, but if you are that well embedded in the industry then you will quite likely agree with me that it has become quite a bit harder to achieve that today than it was in the past. The solution (performance based advertising) shifts the burden of the effectiveness of a campaign onto the wrong party (the owner of the inventory) which has resulted in a series of start-ups that optimize on behalf of inventory owner.<p>This is all like watching eb-and-flood erode a beach and just like real life erosion there are turning points at which the situation can go from steady state to dynamic quite rapidly and it is anybody&#x27;s guess what the new steady configuration will be once all the potential for movement has been exhausted.<p>The ad industry is imo not exactly in a bubble as much as that they are more than a little bit worried about why the usual bag of tricks no longer works and how they plan on going back to when conversion rates were still something to be proud of. I don&#x27;t doubt that this will initially be tackled with a wave of even more invasive advertising, or advertising masquerading as content.<p>The problem is that what was initially an absolute boon for the advertising industry, that you can &#x27;measure&#x27; engagement ended up being the exact problem, you can measure engagement, including a steady drop in engagement over time. And so, by making advertising more and more aggressive the industry has made it impossible - or nearly so - to make a non-aggressive campaign because it has to compete with all the aggressive ones for attention (from the users perspective it is a zero sum game, they only have 24 hours in a day and usually something else to do besides watching and engaging with ads, and if they don&#x27;t then they are not exactly prime material for some demographic to begin with).<p>So now there is a problem, which is that the ad industry can&#x27;t suddenly stop reporting all these engagement metrics, nor can they pull more technological rabbits out of the hat that spawned all these new tricks because these too will work for a while and then run out.<p>It&#x27;s not a simple problem.",1447667670

In particular in software development one encounters the philosophy of &quot;get it out the door quick&quot; regardless of the cost to quality. Engineers are often viewed as a cost-centre rather than the actual producers of value in a business when the bottom line is evaluated. It should be clear to us that businesses that actively capture and nurture engineering talent (google, apple, facebook etc.) are the businesses that are doing better at the moment than those that focus on &quot;unit cost&quot; of &quot;resources&quot; (e.g. IBM, HP) and many are now trying to make that transition as we can see from the trend towards more engineer-friendly processes such as Scrum (away from the more punishing &quot;waterfall&quot; style approaches).",1447667547

If anything, online advertising is actually being underbought at the moment.<p>For there to be a bubble, advertising spend would have to be growing at a rate which outpaces supply of advertising space. In fact, when it comes to online advertising the reverse is true.<p>Consider first that advertising <i>in general</i> is actually a remarkably boring business. The entire industry consistently consumes 1-2% of GDP, and we have not gone out of that historical band. [1] There&#x27;s just not much evidence of there being a bubble in the overall advertising industry.<p>When it comes to internet advertising specifically, the argument for a bubble is even weaker. Ad spend on internet platforms (particularly mobile) continues to lag behind consumer attention. [2] Consumers are spending tons of time on mobile, but advertisers aren&#x27;t spending nearly enough on mobile to match that supply. If anything, I think advertisers should be spending $10-20B more on internet advertising than they do.<p>Finally, consider that advertising prices are at rock bottom. That seems extraordinarily inconsistent with there being a bubble. The author ignores this fact by attempting to insinuate that the bubble is entirely investor-driven, but that doesn&#x27;t match his hypothesis. Firstly, if investors are currently subsidizing the entire online advertising industry, then when investment pulls back we would fully expect advertising prices to rise—enabling the investors to be paid back (ie. not a bubble). Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t match my experience: the late 2000s was a good time to be in adtech or social media, but these days most VCs aren&#x27;t actually that interested in the sector.<p>Yes, advertising is annoying. Maybe it &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot; on you. But that&#x27;s not an argument against it being an effective industry, <i>especially</i> if you&#x27;re arguing against targeted online advertising specifically. The biggest online ad budgets are very tightly run and you can be quite sure that the advertisers have studied and confirmed that they have a significant ROI.<p>Finally, one note about the insinuation that &quot;it&#x27;s going to get ugly&quot; because adtech companies have our personal data. This ignores how incredibly noisy and inaccurate most adtech data is. It&#x27;s &quot;accurate&quot; in aggregate, using statistical models, but it&#x27;s just not very reliable when it comes to an individual. When the individual data is not accurate or trustable, the capacity for danger (or blackmail?) is extremely limited.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-03-03/advertisings-century-of-flat-line-growth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-03-03/advertisings...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends</a>",1447666465

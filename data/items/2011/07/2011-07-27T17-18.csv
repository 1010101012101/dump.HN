They also <i>were</i> criminals, at least according to my reading of the laws of the US.  Now, what you may be looking for is whether they were <i>ethically good</i> --- but don't conflate lawfulness with morality, that's worked out poorly in both directions.<p>But of course, you acknowledge that this is a horribly simplistic view of things.  Even DnD got this, after all (clearly Anon is Chaotic, and whether it's Neutral or Good depends on whom you talk to).<p>So perhaps you might say ""I don't believe Anon's actions were for the good"", or even ""weren't well-intentioned"", but please recognize that passing judgement beyond noting the factual statement that they are criminals, is a personal judgement.  Not that personal opinions shouldn't be argued, defended, and spread --- just that they should not be conflated with fact.",1311789559

He sent nearly-naked photos to a woman he had phone-sex with.  I fail to see how it's objectification, though.  Why does sex imply objectification?

People generally become prostitutes because they are in poverty.  From this particular article, it sounds like the whole area remains a brothel because there's basically no way out for the women there.

Marquis made a comment about ""disapprovals from the women strong enough to speak out"".  The implication there is that all women are offended and only the strong ones dare to speak out.  Clearly it is not true that all women were offended.  Many (most?) of the women who commented did not complain, and several commented positively about the picture.<p>> <i>""But [my wife/my girlfriend/group of women X] didn't think it was sexist"" doesn't necessarily say anything conclusive about whether it is actually sexist. If you are looking for an expert opinion, seek out the opinion of someone who has spent time learning about how sexism works. Your wife/girlfriend/group of women X may or may not be in that category. There are more women than men in that group, but having a vagina does not gain you instant entry.</i><p>This is a candy-coated way of saying that we must listen to those most zealous about sexism.  We can't listen to the average woman or the opinion of most women.  No, we have to listen to those obsessed with finding sexism, even if that means they find it in places it doesn't really exist.<p>Why must <i>sexy</i> always be synonymous with <i>sexist</i>?

Now I need to decide how to move forward.<p>I was asked to sign on ""full-time"" with a small business (startup?) that's been around for a few years. The deal was that I'd be paid a small fee on a per-job basis (basically a deployment to a remote job site) so that I could pay bills, while growing the company. I was also to be compensated in the form of stock. (Privately held company) I had recently lost my full-time job and had enough safety pad to take the risk, so I jumped in.<p>I now know I shouldn't have been so optimistic as to enter the situation believing that I'd be taken care of, and instead should have gotten things in writing before I started the work. Hindsight is 20/20. I spoke with the owner of the company about stock compensation and was asked to make a request to them in terms of how much stock I should receive at the end of the year.<p>I thought it would be appropriate (having committed a year or so of my life to growing, improving, and developing for this company) to receive stock at a multiplier level (that is to say, not 1:1, but more like 2:1). So I submitted a stock plan of 2x - 3x of the standard American salary ($40,000/yr) for my yearly compensation in stock, to be awarded at the end of the fiscal year.<p>The owners were mortified that I'd make such a request, and without responding with a ""no,"" made sure I knew that I wouldn't be getting my request. On the advice of a trusted business friend, I'm seeking out what is an appropriate multiplier to use in stock compensation of work performed, based on my situation.<p>Last bit of information/details: I've literally lived the job for almost a year now. Traveling, residence, 60-80 hr work weeks, sometimes done in four days; doing marketing, developing, sales, ... as though I were the boot-strapping founder of the company. The company is privately held, and I would be diluting the stock of others by whatever I am awarded - but I would be getting less than 5% of total shares if I were to receive my original request.

First, mention the name of the company. Second, mention what position this is for and what product I'd be working on. After that, mention the technology stack if applicable. After that, ask if I'm interested and/or if it is okay to send me the job description (if you send a job description or email, thank me because this makes me feel less like a slice of meat that you are trying to use). After that, ask when is a good a time when you could call me back (the next day is my preferable choice). THEN HANG UP. This should take about 5-15 minutes.<p>In the first phone call, I should not hear ""this is for X amount an hour/year/whatever"".

Basically I'm not a scientist at all, did Math as an undergrad but almost no stats or any of that type of vodoo stuff (topology, abstract algebra etc real math stuff is what I did ;p).<p>So basically I had no clue what Neuroimaging meant or did other than people get shoved in scanner, huge magnets turn and they see inside you ;p<p>But what I found is there are plenty of computer science problems in a field of Neuroimaging (and neuroscience) that a programmer can help with. (processing, image analysis, data mining, storage, Visualization whatever) Most labs don't really have people who's primary job is programming. Thus there a lots of tools that are just hack jobs long forgotten that no one is maintaining but everyone depends on. Those things can be helped out by good programming practice and with real programmers behind them. What sucks is getting funding for these people but Open Source can help here by pooling multiple people from many labs into common projects.<p>Also, if you do work with scientist, most of them will talk to you for hours about the science of what they do. You can usually ask the most stupid question and they will be happy to answer it. I've found that most people I work with are open and even more if the work you do helps them achieve their scientific goals. So in the end if you need to learn some science stuff, they will usually be helpful.<p>(BTW my project is in my profile, will be open source soon, waiting for some political approval process).",1311787494

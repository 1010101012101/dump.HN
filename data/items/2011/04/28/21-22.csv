In this circumstance, it's impossible to distinguish between a situation where one person gets 10 upvotes and holds a well-agreed opinion and the other person gets 1 or 2 upvotes and is arguing his opinion just well enough to avoid being downvoted.<p>I understand that we're supposed to form our own opinions as to who we agree with, but sometimes its just not reasonable to take the time to do enough research. Sometimes, you want to learn from someone that actually knows what they're talking about.<p>Without some sort of vote indicator, it's hard to tell who has the most accurate opinion, except often in subjects like law, security, and seo where there are known experts that often chime in (e.g. grellas, tptacek, patio11).<p>I'd suggest that a form of ""fuzzy vote counts"" be implemented. Something to indicate either a relative score (""this comment is substantially higher voted than its parent"") or just an approximate value (""unvoted"", ""few votes"", ""many votes"") without a specific score.",1304027925

Just yesterday, I started teaching my 9yr old son programming - he kept pestering me for a while after the science fair at the school, where one of his buddies had a ""programming"" project.<p>Long story made short - I ended up choosing Python. Intuitively, I strongly resisted this conclusion. But in the end, it made sense: the syntax is clean (some would say too rigid, I say that's okay for a teaching language), it's pretty hard to obfuscate the code (unlike Perl), you can do ""import turtle"" and voila it's Logo, and there are plenty of tutorials and books geared towards beginners including young children.<p>We had lots of fun doing things like:<p>>>> import turtle<p>>>> t = turtle.Pen()<p>>>> t.forward(50)<p>>>> t.left(90)<p>>>> t.forward(50)<p>I showed him variables, a little bit about strings and lists.

If you don't file such a form, horrific penalties ensue.  H1-B workers frequently have accounts in their home countries with more than $10K.  They come here to work, become residents for US tax purposes, and are liable for the penalties.<p>I have talked to more than one such person who finds it expedient to quit their US job and leave in order to eliminate the US tax risk.<p>EDIT:  In case the connection is not obvious, the same logic would apply to immigrant entrepreneurs.  If you have some capital outside the USA and you get a green card, you can stay (and risk six-figure tax penalties) or you can give up the green card and eliminate your tax risk.

A lot of people don't stay for dinner because they come in early (and get breakfast), they have families or whatever.<p>In my case, I like to take little breaks when I need to so don't tend to work in 2 solid 4 hour blocks so I'll be in the office quite awhile. Plus if I'm just going to go home and catch up on a couple of shows on Hulu, I may as well do that in the office. It's nicer than my apartment. :) I do live in walking distance to the office too.<p>But I guess my main point is that I'm not clock-watching. I leave when I have something else to do and/or feel like I've done what I need to do. I like what I do. I'm not waiting for the clock to hit 5 so I can leave. YMMV.<p>Honestly this is another huge positive for me. I once worked at a place where I worked from 7 to 4 with half an hour for lunch (due to market times and a time difference). The rest of the team turned up at 9-9:30 and all they noticed was I left at 4 and I was called up on it. The net result was I turned up at 9, left at 5-5:30 and took an hour for lunch (resigning a month or two later).<p>Google, at least in my limited experience (I've only been here ~6 months), is much more results-oriented. We trust you to do what you need to do. I know some guys that routinely turn up at 1pm or later or skip a weekday and work on Saturday instead. I've seen no issues of ""face time"".<p>I know I work longer than a 40 hour week, sometimes substantially longer. But I don't mind. I have no other pressing responsibilities pulling me away. For those that do, it doesn't seem to be an issue.<p>But in the absence of responsibilities pulling you elsewhere (which are perfectly understandable) if you're watching the clock, IMHO you're probably in the wrong profession.",1304027363

2495222,comment,2491908,2494839,3,0,dkarl,,,"Secreting insulin is the mechanism that keeps blood sugar down, which is only half the job of homeostasis.  The other half is keeping blood sugar up when you haven't eaten a bunch of carbs recently, and it seems (anecdotally) that if people don't exercise that second half -- i.e., if they keep their blood sugar up by eating constantly -- that their body's ability to keep blood sugar up on its own atrophies.<p>When your body's blood sugar regulation is working properly, you can skip one or two meals without any dire consequences(+).  You have a bunch of glycogen in your muscles and liver, for one thing, and your body just has to release that energy into your bloodstream as glucose.  It's really that simple, but the impression I get from a lot of people is that their blood sugar regulation is only half-working.  They take it for granted that if they miss lunch, they're going to be a wreck in the afternoon.  They become tired and irritable, and they may even have headaches.  That shouldn't be considered normal.  A sugar crash isn't a normal reaction to a brief interruption of a healthy diet; it's a warning sign that your diet before the crash was not healthy.<p>(+)  I won't swear this holds true if you exercise intensely, since I haven't tried it, but the paleo lifestyle guys say they have no problem exercising on their ""lean"" days.",1304027109

It was totally optional and you could eat with members from your team or others, whatever. It sounds similar to what you're describing and i thought it worked really well, i liked it, and it always bummed me out a little when it wasn't there on those bookend days. sometimes i'd be busy during lunch and there might be something waiting in the kitchen or i'd go out to eat with a friend.<p>I don't think it really works if you force this sorta thing, but if the food is compelling (i really liked the cheese, personally) and everyone's on good terms, i think the staff lunch works really well. the exception here is if there's a toxic team member or individual, which i think really sours the experience and which many people may be also reacting to.<p>When i worked as a line cook, staff lunches were also equally gratifying, but for entirely different reasons.",1304026937

In other words, a ""shortage"", to the extent that it exists, may be a rational response by americans to poor career prospects.  It might not make sense to use the immigration system to increase the pool of PhD level scientists and engineers when the most objective research available is concluding that these careers have lost their luster.  At the very least, we should recognize that this would probably provide even greater deterrence for people in the US who do have the right to choose their career path.<p>I tend to favor a points-based system in the US, something more similar to Canada or Australia.  I've read about these systems, and while they certainly give credit to scientists and engineers, they appear to be very broad-based (plumbers, lawyers, and electricians get more points than programmers in Australia, last time I looked).<p>One thing I do agree with - the current system is horrible, the worst of all worlds.  We bring in lots of ""guest workers"", targeting fields that probably aren't experiencing any shortage, and we create an indentured system that in my opinion pretty much violates the concept of personal freedom.  It's a crappy system for immigrant and american scientists and engineers, but it does serve a few interests very well.<p>I pretty much say this every time: take a large but not unlimited number of immigrants, value education and skills in the abstract but avoid focusing too narrowly on any particular trade, profession, or skill set, and give immigrants full freedom to determine their own course in life (ie., no geographical or career restrictions).",1304025354

I then discovered that he does spend a good amount of his time alone. He'll just get a coffee and sit their browsing on his smart phone.<p>After that, I take it easy finding myself alone, even if there are lot of people near me gathering, talking and laughing... It doesn't bother me any more, I'm actually better off with it.",1304024822

The amount of paperwork for her, on the other hand, to go to the US, is quite unpleasant, and the process would even involve a doctor having a look at her.  And she has a PhD in biochemistry (she's employable in other words) and is the wife and mother of US citizens.<p>I wouldn't ever cite Italy as a model for the ease of its bureaucratic procedures, but in this specific case, Italy does come out ahead of the US.",1304024678

At best you can use a passive EM detector to see all the traffic on a set of wires, so you don't have to cut them temporarily, but that still requires physical contact, and can only see things which are routed down that cable.  For any business that guards its doors and ethernet ports, and has routers/switches instead of hubs, this is pretty much complete security.<p>For wireless, you... sit up to a few hundred feet away (miles if you have a good parabolic antenna), and run Wireshark.

Policy improvement is a great idea, and I was happy to have it happen in the United States even during the several years of my life when I wasn't living here.<p>But I ask about the policies of other places, and what attractions those set up for immigrants, for a policy-based reason. Most public policies cannot be set to be ideal in the abstract. Indeed, there is not even enough agreement among voters to be sure what the abstract ideal of perfect policy would look like. Every country in every era, democracy or dictatorship, makes policy trade-offs. I think the discussion of United States policy can be best informed--and thus most helpful to the United States, the country I now live in--if people like you with valuable international perspective are as specific as possible in comparing United States policies to policies of other countries you know about. As I wrote in the first reply I posted in this thread, there ought to be official statistics on many of the issues mentioned in the article that opened this thread, and those official statistics from various governments may guide us better to understand what policy trade-offs make for a thriving economy, well functioning democracy and rule of law, and an open and vibrant society.",1304024415

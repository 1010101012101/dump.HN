This type of plist gives info about an app and points to an IPA which contains the app bundle itself. I've worked with enterprise certs before, and this was one of the ways we would initiate the intalls from a webpage.<p>So my guess is that they are indeed using an enterprise certificate. Though I can't be 100% sure, I can't think of anything else that would be done this way.<p>I was always under the impression that Apple required companies to have at least 500 employees to qualify for an enterprise cert. But, it looks like they might have lifted that restriction, which is fantastic.",1344286789

4347237,comment,4347165,4347165,6,0,Skywing,,,"Listen, in life you just need to find ""your thing."" Your thing can be anything that you enjoy doing, or feel like you're good at. Everybody has a ""thing"", whether or not they know it. Sometimes I hear people say that they wish they were good at something, or had a hobby. Well, they are good at something, they just have to find it. So, find your thing and during your free time you really need to make an effort to do that thing on a regular basis. It can be running, fishing, programming, hanging out with family and friends - just something to take you away from work and stress. Working a job, 8 hours a day or more, can be difficult to unwind from. But neglecting to unwind will catch up with you eventually, and I always felt like it hit me in the form of depression or just a general negative attitude.<p>If programming is your ""thing"" but yet you program at work, as well, like me, then this can be pretty difficult. If this is your scenario, I'd suggest switching it up completely, at home. Venture into some unknown language all together on a platform that you're not familiar with, even. Forget the JVM. If you stick to something that is close to what you do at your stressful job then I feel like your mind may never fully relax, even at home. I've been having a ton of fun learning how to program iphone applications over the past week. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time but always felt like the barrier to entry was high, because of the OSX requirement, the funky Objective-C language, the clunky Xcode IDE. But, newer versions of Xcode and the Objective-C compiler have become really awesome, actually. For me, iphone app dev is a slightly crazy but interesting combination of visual coding, because there's a lot of weird things like ""shift click and drag a line from this GUI element over to this line of text in your code to create some very important delegate connection"", combined with your typical programming but in a awkwardly funky language syntax - it's all pretty fun, really.<p>Just some thoughts. Good luck!",1344286623

Some of me colleagues think it is really great and love Java. They think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread.<p>I don't. (I have caught the Clojure bug).<p>Last year I also had a bad performance review in a Microsoft style review system. My skill set didn't quite match what was required at the time, true, but contributed to the best of my ability. So now I am part of a performance review, but guess what, there is no education budget to help me learn the stuff I wasn't so good at and I think the performance review doesn't do anything to address my motivation. I have to do that myself, according to my manager.<p>On top of that I was diagnosed with MS a few years ago. I inject myself three times a week with Rebif, in the beginning I really really struggled with it and it would take me a long time to do (30 minutes or more). Now I can do it in less than a minute. I have been using anti-depressants for almost two years now and although I feel a lot better I still find it difficult to get motivated and to get excited about (work) things.<p>So, here is my question to you: How do you get positive and motivated (again) and stay that way?

Not to express any opinion about the regulatory action happening here, but you  might be surprised to learn that you could be better off swallowing a nail than you would be if you swallowed a pair of these tiny magnets.<p>Swallowing the magnets is a <i>big deal</i>. As they transit your system, they can easily find themselves on either side of a fold of tissue, whereupon they lock together, gradually kill the tissue, leak gut bacteria into the bloodstream and create sepsis.<p>On the other hand, if you swallow a nail, there is apparently a very good chance that your doctor will just tell you to go home and look for it in your poop. This according to a journal article I found last time the story came up.<p>Worse still, the risks are deceptive. As a parent, you would no doubt freak out completely if you discovered your toddler ate a nail. I know I'd be at the emergency room minutes later. On the other hand, parents are routinely told by their doctors to wait and watch the poop when other innocuous round objects are swallowed.  It is very easy to see how parents could make the wrong call about the magnets and wind up with gravely ill children as a result.<p>---<p>More things you might want to know about the CPSC complaint:<p>* Despite warnings, there've been numerous continuous incidents of kids needing surgery after ingesting the magnets.<p>* The magnets are marketed to kids 14 years and up; there are apparently lots of reports of teenagers using the magnets to hold jewelry for e.g. fake lip piercings.<p>* When you sell tiny rare earth magnets to teenagers, it is awfully hard to ensure that those magnets don't end up in the GI tracts of little kids that share a house with those teenagers.<p>* Warning labels for this suck because the product practically demands to be taken out of packaging; once you assemble a structure with them, it's not like you break them back up and put them in a box.<p>* Little kids love these things, because they're shiny, they click, and they move in unexpected ways.<p>The CPSC wants the death penalty for this product.

Rather than seeing it as the creator's right to choose the terms, they see it as the <i>consumer</i>'s right to access and modify source code.<p>That's the fundamental split: copyright normally gives the creator the ""right"" to take away the consumer's rights; the GPL merely prevents this and maintains the consumer's rights.<p>As others have pointed out, the idea behind copyright is to give a creator a <i>limited monopoly</i> over some information (ideally in order to encourage arts and science). The GPL subverts this: not only does the initial creator give up the monopoly, but the license ensures that nobody can subsequently reclaim a monopoly on the work in question. That is, the GPL involves not only giving rights to your consumers but also making sure as many people as possible cannot take those rights away again.<p>Essentially, it shouldn't be the creator's choice at all. The consumer has some rights (like being able to see and modify what runs on their computer) and these rights should not be infringed. That's entire core of the GPL and that's why it's the opposite of copyright normally: it protects the consumer and not the producer. The fact that it happens to be implemented on top of copyright law really is an implementation detail--if it was possible to pass a law protecting the right of every computer owner to be able to access and modify any code running on their system, the FSF would surely support it.<p>In summary: the GPL is about the consumer where copyright is normally about the producer.

Previously with the tab expander button in the top right and the close buttons on the left edge, closing tabs meant reaching all the way from one corner to the other side of the screen, which is not always easy or possible with a single finger.<p>I think you should definitely pursue tweaks that reduce the amount of finger movement required to do common tasks. Just to steal one example from Opera, when you long-press a link, the context menu appears directly under your fingers, so you don't have to go anywhere to get to it (similar to the right-click menu on the desktop). This is incredibly convenient, because navigating the context menu doesn't cause you to lose your place on the page.",1340754617

It's not hard: just replace sets with sequences or arrays.  It will gives you natural ORDER and SLICE operators as well as new aggregates FIRST, LAST, NTH.  It solves duplicates without having to introduce bags, gives windowing functions for free and probably better represents how modern RDBMS interpret a query.  Another hint why sequences may work better than sets is the fact that regular set operations such as INTERSECT and UNION (as opposed to UNION ALL, which becomes concatenation) are so rarely used in real-world queries.<p>I'm not even arguing that this is a good approach, but I think it deserves some discussion and it appears they never even thought of a possibility of changing the model treating it not as an instrument, but as a sacred scripture.",1340754614

The article argues that the reason NYC hasn't been destroyed by rent control is that it liberalized rent control into the more flexible rent stabilization (which allows market-driven changes, just within certain year-to-year rate limits), which mitigated the worst problems of rent control.<p>I don't really have a worked-out position on the question, but I'd tentatively think that stabilization that <i>doesn't</i> amount to de-facto freezes would avoid some of the worst problems, since prices would track the market, just with a lag, as opposed to never doing so. For example, the problem with CA's Prop 13 isn't that it limits the y-on-y assessment increase for property-tax purposes, but that it limits it <i>to 2% per year</i>, not accounting for inflation, which is such an absurdly low limit that assessments will <i>never</i> track market prices, even in a delayed sense. Esp. since in years with >2% inflation it actually mandates a <i>cut</i> in real valuation.

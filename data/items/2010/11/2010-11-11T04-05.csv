1892952,comment,1892550,1892550,0,0,kragen,,,"Silicon Valley owes much of its existence to people sharing information between companies: at the Homebrew Computer Club, at Hackers, at First Tuesdays, at user groups, on tours, at parties, in lectures. Some of that sharing was officially sanctioned, and some of it was not. It's a special part of its culture, and I think accounts for much of its innovation. Apple has always been an exception.<p>Google grew up in the shadow of much bigger, better-funded competitors: Microsoft, then later Yahoo.  I speculate, without having asked anybody, that this accounts for the culture of fanatical secrecy, outstripping even that of Apple, that has enveloped the company since its early days, and which I think now is a permanent part of Google's culture, even though the bigger, better-funded competitors are now the underdogs, unable to execute.<p>This firing is a symptom of that tradition of secrecy.<p>I fear that the next half-century of the Valley will be poisoned by this, because Google is today's Fairchild, Mountain View's Microsoft. Every new startup will be backed by Googlers or Xooglers, founded by Xooglers, or at least advised by [GX]ooglers.  So this poisonous culture of secrecy, which kills innovation, will fill the Valley like a vile miasma, along with the many wonderful things that come from Google experience.",1289451521

The are a number of issues at play here — RTT (Round Trip Time, i.e. ping/latency), window sizes, packet loss and initcwnd (TCP's initial window).<p>The combination of the limitations imposed by the speed of light and TCP's windowing system means that you are buggered transferring large files over high-latency TCP connections. I haven't checked their figures, but here's a TCP rate calculator I just found which lets you tune the different parameters: <a href=""http://osn.fx.net.nz/LFN/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osn.fx.net.nz/LFN/</a><p><i>The greater the delay, the bigger the impact. For example if we take a standard Windows XP machine and plug in the values for a standard Gigabit LAN (typically .2ms latency between hosts) we get a maximum speed of 700Mbit/sec, but if we try if between two hosts, one of them in the USA (typically around 120ms) the maximum transfer rate falls to 1.17 Mbit/sec.</i><p>There are a number of attempts trying to fix TCP's failings in this regard. For starters, see this presentation by the Google/SPDY guys making a case for changing TCP Slow Start: <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/spdy/An_Argument_For_Changing_TCP_Slow_Start.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/spdy/An_Argument_For_Changing_TCP_Sl...</a> — here's the IETF Draft for increasing TCP's Initial Window <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hkchu-tcpm-initcwnd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hkchu-tcpm-initcwnd</a><p>And, more radically, see the uTP work by the Bittorrent folk who are trying to create a better alternative to TCP instead of simply fixing it — <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol</a> + <a href=""https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp</a> (source code).<p>Anyways, sorry for not going into too much detail (it's 4am), but hope I was able to clear things up a little.",1289449017

It and its students seemed much more focused and serious and I never really felt comfortable enough with the teacher to really discuss my form or the techniques.

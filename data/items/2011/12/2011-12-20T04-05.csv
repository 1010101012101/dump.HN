Today's press conference, which I watched in its entirety, specifically highlighted the entrepreneurial culture and mindset (in addition to world class science) that the Technion will bring to the table above and beyond the traditional graduate level sciences provided by Cornell.<p>I shouldn't really have to list the accomplishments of the Technion in this forum. Its faculty and alumni have had a hand in thousands of patents, hundreds of companies listed on American stock exchanges (not to mention Israeli or European) an outsized influence on virtually every technology we use today, have attracted R&D centers for many global technology leaders and, oh ya, a number of Nobel prizes.<p>This is actually a Very Big Deal (TM) for New York City, Cornell, The Technion and Israel.",1324357034

That's a bad policy because one size fits all leads to wearing burlap sacks.<p>The fact that npm is <i>not</i> a planned economy is brilliant. If you want to add ratings, etc., npm is backed by CouchDB and thereform ridiculously each to build upon. In addition to being able to freely read npm repo info, you can also extend package.json info with your own fields. I remember when drupamodules.com came out, providing a solution for rating Drupal modules (something drupal.org still doesn't have, AFAIK). The guy who made it got grief for not making something blessed by the mothership.<p>As an example of how CouchDB helps make npm awesome, wanna find every field used in npm package.json files?

But you lose that if you still do O(n) worth of seeking. There is no big-O difference between inserting and deleting in the middle of an array and a plain linked list, if the linked list is forced to seek.<p>I'm sure this is as obvious to you as it is to me, but perhaps the perspective it comes from explains why people are thinking that your described operations on the list are a dodgy benchmark for judging linked lists vs arrays; absent constant factors, they should perform the same. (And yes, for reasonable input on modern machines, the constant factors will dominate.)",1324356150
3372331,comment,3371392,3372056,3,0,shinratdr,,,"> If they ever did manage to get Android killed in the way they seem to want to (Jobs' 'thermonuclear' option), don't they realize that would make them the 90's-Microsoft of smartphones?<p>Not really, because it wouldn't. You don't see Apple going after WP7. Nor WebOS. Yes they are small competitors but that's only because Android is free and established, if there was no Android, they would pick up the slack quite quickly. Apple has a specific problem with Android because of the level of insider information Google had on the iPhone project at the time Android was being retooled into an iOS competitor.<p>Microsoft's schtick was embrace, extend, extinguish which was a much more two-faced policy and evil policy. 90's Microsoft wanted to own everything and control everything, from the lowliest embedded device to the most powerful servers in the world, from desktop PCs, to mobile devices, to the internet in general, you name it. If it was related to computers, it should run Windows, browse with IE and Microsoft should receive a license fee for it.<p>Apple has no such desires now, and never really had them in the first place. 90's Microsoft was genuinely malicious. 2011 Apple on the other hand just doesn't like Android and has a serious problem with how it was conceived. IMO because it repeats so perfectly the mistake Steve Jobs made when letting Bill Gates get so close to Apple. True, they maintain more control over their devices than Microsoft ever did, but they don't have the ""100% control of the entire market in all aspects"" aspirations that Microsoft had. It's just a completely different situation.",1324356138

more closely to how you would like them to, instead of just being forced to integrate
with the existing stuff ""because it's there"".<p>There are no holy cows, or 'core that shall not be modified', because everything

Here is what I wrote 2 years ago about the ideas for a future language that embraces democracy instead of tyranny.<p>What I can see is that npm relies heavily on GitHub and the tools that GitHub provides (such as wikis and documentcloud). Personally, this kind of integration could lead to a revolution, since it makes collaboration much easier (it also makes it easier to evaluate reputation of developers, dependencies etc.)<p>I am a Python developer and I think npm is already a MUCH better platform than PyPi given the tight integration with GitHub and I can only imagine what the future brings.<p>===<p>The idea of the social platform is to create a platform where developers can collaborate and a platform that promotes quality software. CPAN, Ruby Gems and Python Package Index are early versions of this vision and they need to become more social to become more useful. The social platform should be applied to the core libraries as well and not just be used for the external libraries. A language's standard library should be a democracy where the best and most used libraries win - and not like now, where libraries win by being selected by a few dictators!<p>Essentials of this platform are:<p>* Easy distribution: It should be easy to push out modules to the platform.<p>* Easy forking: It should be easy to fork modules, to apply patches and to send patches back. Using something like git or mercurial is a must.<p>* Reviews and a reputation system: The platform should have reviews, but also reputation, something like Stack Overflow's excellent reputation system. I.e. a system where helpful developers are rewarded for their hard work.<p>* Search and discovery: It should be easy to find modules you are looking for and to compare modules. If I am looking for a template library, then I might want to sort template libraries by how many others are using them or by a developer's reputation.<p>* Fully integrated into the language: This platform should be fully included in the language and ship with the language. The signup process to get on the platform should be very easy.<p>* Trac like features included: This platform should include tickets, timeline of changes and a basic wiki.<p>Most of these pieces are partially implemented, especially in products like GitHub and BitBucket. What is needed is a much better integration with the languages. The bottom line is that languages should embrace ""social programming"" and implement a platform similar to GitHub/BitBucket that enables developers for easy collaboration.<p>from <a href=""http://amix.dk/blog/post/19475"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amix.dk/blog/post/19475</a>",1324354372

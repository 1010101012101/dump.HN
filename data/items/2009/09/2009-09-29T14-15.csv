What you can't replicate overnight is the <i>ubiquity</i> of Craigslist; the fact that they cover the country, and that everyone, even very non-technical friends of mine, know what it is. Both of these could be overcome if Craigslist started charging too much. (Though if they stay the course I'm not sure how they could be defeated in any reasonable period of time.)",1254235443

They point out that if the outcomes of games were a true reflection of the teams' abilities, then the situation ""Team A beats Team B beats Team C which beats Team A"" should never occur. They call this an intransitive triplet.""<p>The outcome of the game is never meant to be a ""true reflection"" of the teams' abilities, but a reflection of their ability against that side, on that day, in those conditions. A round-robin style tournament is used to have a team playing different opponents, a mix of different styles. Central attacking sides. Defense and counter-attack. Wide open matches. Closed central movement. Teams alter their strategy against specific opponents and try to find holes in their game and exploit an edge.<p>This seems like a problem with the statistical model, not with the sport, because ""A > B > C > A"" is possible in a team sport, and not just because of a luck factor. One team may have strengths that exploit certain weaknesses in other teams. That are uncountable examples - Team A lacks fitness and is weaker in the last 20 minutes; but this will only be exploited by a team who have a high fitness level. Team B has as weak left wing, but this will only be exploited by a team with a strong right winger. The list goes on.",1254234891

An organization for suicide prevention<p><a href=""http://www.save.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.save.org/</a><p>puts up billboards in my town to remind family members to have their depressed relatives treated for depression, saying that untreated depression is the main risk factor for suicide. That factual statement is correct, as I can verify from having read many books by psychologists or medical doctors about mood disorders. I got into this reading back in the 1990s as part of studying suicide risk in different cultures,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/suicide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/suicide.html</a><p>and research on this issue continues to be replicated across many studies with different investigators in different places.<p>You ask about one category of medicines, the SSRI medicines commonly prescribed as antidepressants.

My overall impression of the mechanism for increased suicide risk upon SSRI treatment for depression is that some depressed patients go from thinking that there is nothing they can do to thinking that the one thing they can do is to harm themselves. That's why I follow Goodwin and Jamison in thinking that for most depressed patients whose history of mood variation is poorly known, the best initial treatment is a mood-stabilizing medicine (such as lithium, carbamazepine, divalproex, or lamotrigine) rather than an SSRI medicine. But I am not a physician, and I urge persons who are concerned about their depressed moods to check with a physician who has clinical experience with depressed patients to be evaluated for what might or might not be at issue.",1254234680

Baseball is the ultimate game for a statistician, as you have data for every single pitch thrown and the outcome.  American Football breaks the game down into series of discrete events (downs) each of which has a numerical outcomes (yards gained or lost).  Basketball generates 10s of events every game with a definite outcome that can generally be assigned to a single player (shot made, missed, turnover, free throw, rebound, etc.).<p>All of this gives fans ways to analyze and rank individual players and teams in a fairly objective way.  Thus, the immense popularity of fantasy leagues.<p>Soccer is inherently more subjective, as there are far fewer events with an objective outcome.  With scoring a rare event, and no obvious ways to assign numerical values to all the things that happen between scoring chances, subjective analysis is all that's available.<p>Which ties back into the original article in that freak occurrences and dumb luck can have a much larger impact in soccer.  One team can play much better for most of the game, but a freak goal, controversial call or uncharacteristic error can have an outsize impact in a low scoring affair.  This is mitigated in the round robin format rounds with accumulated wins and points, but is very much a factor in one-and-done games.<p>I believe I read before that at one time even the final round was a multi team affair, with the champion determined by cumulative totals against the other teams, but it was done away with because fans wanted a definitive championship match between just two teams.",1254234636

It is a question whether they can perform consistently in a series of matches with the correct strategy each time, whether they can adapt to changes, whether they are focused at the important moments.

I am not sure what GitHub's plan is for taking over the world.. but it would great for new users, if for each of their in-browser actions they provided help text that showed the corresponding CLI command. This reinforces their intent of these kinds of features.<p>EDIT: That is humorous.. I write the above only to see this: <a href=""http://try.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://try.github.com/</a>.

EC2 instances offer a range of I/O throughput in different instances: a t1.micro has 'low' I/O, an m1.small has 'moderate' and an hi1.4xlarge offers 1.1 GB/s write and 2.0 GB/s write.  Cost has to figure into a benchmarked analysis here.<p>And CPU. One of Google's big claims at launch was that CPU time was notably less expensive than on EC2.

Procrastination and ""seeming busy"" is standard fare for my day. It's far too easy for me to get distracted by checking Facebook, Twitter, or even tangential data sheets.<p>Yet, despite my bad habits, the environment at my job <i>forced</i> me to get down and churn through code. Some of my officemates could fit the salaryman stereotype[1], but <i>all</i> of them posessed a capability for relentless focus. I initially tried to settle in by ""shooting the breeze"" and making smalltalk, but they seemed to prefer communicating through their work: some code, but more importantly, well-done demos.<p>In the span of those 3 months, while I always brought headphones with me, I never ended up using them: the silence of the office carried a note of tension, the sound of concentration. Listening to this proved to make me more productive than I'd normally be, if I were listening to (even quiet) music.<p>I came in expecting to be maybe 20% efficient, as the OP mentions: a few minutes here, a half hour there. At the end, it was nearer to 75-80%: instead of procrastinating, I set goals for myself to get things done, because that was really the best way to get through to my neighbors.<p>While I don't think that this sort of pressure cooker environment is well-suited for all people, I think it speaks volumes to how positive peer pressure, in more ways than one, can force people to shape up. I'm not sure I would've survived for a 6 months or a year, but it very quickly eliminated my excuses.

I think the key point comes from this (taken from the OP):<p>> Players who want to reach the peak of each specialization can count on surrounding cities to provide services or resources, even workers.  As other players build, your city can draw on their resources.<p>What some people may not realize is that the cities in this new game are pitifully small (probably so that a computer can handle trying to update 20k sims at a time), so in order to actually do anything of significance, you usually have to draw from surrounding cities for materials, people, etc. This is the part of the game that requires online-only, because unless you want to be simulating all of the cities in your region (which I'm assuming you don't, but I don't really know whether the computation costs would be that high), you need some sort of server to handle that for you.<p>People claim that they came out with an ""offline patch"" that allows you to play offline, and while that is true, you then miss out on all the city-sharing features, and thus your cities end up crappy, because it is impossible to manage all the resources within a single city.<p>I'm not saying that what EA/Maxis is doing is necessary, but people seem to be missing that this is the main reason that the cities are always online, not just for the city saving features or anything.<p>Also, I do know about the StarCraft to StarCraft 2 drama, and from what I can tell, people don't really care any more, and people have gotten over the fact that they need internet to play their game. Sure, sometimes the internet drops in the middle of a tournament, and people get riled up about it again, but it seems to have died down very much since the launch.",1363406583

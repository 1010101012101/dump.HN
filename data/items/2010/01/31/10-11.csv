Oh well, you're still miles off.<p>1) You can read from the interview that the quotee was speaking to a non-technical person. Even so, they're using the term in the commonly used sense. But you haven't shown that they're wrong, only that you disagree with the term.<p>2) You are right. This is the only falsehood I can see here. I'll stipulate that its ok in a 'you know what I meant' kinda way.<p>3) Your answer to 2) depends on the quotee speaking about PHP, but now they aren't? And in 1) you said that scripting languages don't exist. Basically, you're reaching. Anyway, please name a scripting language which is not executed on line order. PHP certainly is.<p>4) Values aren't mentioned anywhere. Anyway, PHP requires functions and classes to be declared before use. (Strictly speaking, values don't exist before they are used, so what you said doesn't make sense. I presume you meant variables, but variables aren't declared. So I presume you meant defined, but strictly speaking there is no such thing as a variable in PHP anyway, just a mapping of strings to values (see: all the literature on the topic, including mine)).<p>5) They're obviously talking in the context of a native compiler, so I see nothing wrong with this.<p>6) They do? First I heard of it. I'm guessing you've got a funny definition of 'modern compiled languages' to back this up.<p>7) Executables don't though.<p>8) Not necessarily, sure. The first iteration of my PHP compiler was 10 times slower. But to say that the quotee is _wrong_ just because some implementation can be slower than some other implementation, is faulty logic.<p>9) What's your point? Why are they wrong?<p>So I'll give you one. Two if we count number 8, but that only counts for the most extreme form of pedantry, and it doesn't really contradict anything. So, yeah, one.

However, the amount of money 5Mbps of bandwidth costs is trivial compared to the cost of  maintaining a separate copper pair to your house.<p>At /my scale/  I can buy bandwidth at around $1 per megabit/sec.   1Mbps is, uh, around 320 gigabytes of data.    Even at half utilization that's less than a penny per gigabyte, and any but the smallest of local ISPs are going to dwarf my bandwidth usage.  This is the sort of market where cost scales down quite a lot as you scale up, so I would bet quite a lot of money that comcast pays less than I do.<p>sure, if I wanted to double my usage, I'd have to buy some new network equipment, and spend some network admin time, but generally speaking the cost of your network equipment (at least at my scale)  is fairly small compared to the cost of buying the transit in the first place.     It certainly doesn't double the cost of bandwidth; and even if it did, bandwidth would still be cheaper than the local loop to your customer's home.<p>So yeah, uh,  your average dsl is what five megabits/sec on a really good day?   are you seriously trying to tell me that you can buy a copper loop for less than five bucks a month?<p>(Actually, I've been in the industry all my life and I've never been involved in buying copper loops;  I guess it's possible they are that cheap;  If they are,  and I find out (oy, the costs of almost everything in this industry are guarded like state secrets.

Nothing to worry about, though - your followup comments are very clear!<p>> Megastore, however, is an example of a ""NoSQL"" system<p>Looking at Google's recent papers, they actually seem to be moving more in a SQL-ish direction. Dremel, in particular, appears to be a variant of SQL that allows easier access to nested and/or repeated columns.

It does make a big difference and without knowing both that and the details of each business, no one can say if this is a good deal for either side.<p>Much discussion acts like this is free money, or winning the lottery, or even that it's a straight trade of equity for cash.<p>Analysis is at the level of observation that ""150 is greater than 17"" therefore ""it is a better deal now"". But ""150 is greater than 17"" has little to do with anything, and such level of analysis is as financially naive as the prudence shown by those who bought million dollar houses and thought they could afford it because the initial payments were $500 a month, but which came with a variable APR that undergoes a big increase after 12 months, and then has a balloon payment  greater than the original mortgage value if you make it to the end of the loan. But the monthly payment is $500 so why not eh, and ignore all other details of the contract. It seems like the financial skills here stop at is one number bigger than the other, and anything involving percentages, conditions, or interest is simply overlooked because it is beyond people's mathematical skills.<p>Poor math skills and an inability to read contracts are common in our society and this weakness is definitely exploited in many situations.",1296513310

And it's close to 0 for companies that want to use their money for future growth, and pay less taxes.<p>- a valid parameter on which reward should be based seems Gross Margin (since it is reflecting to how the company is doing in global, not internal decisions(salary, advertising,office space). As example: advisers should not get punished (get less reward) if you are doing so well that you increased salaries, or moved to new office, etc..<p>- The big question was then how should for example 2% promised equity = ?% GM (x% EQ = K * x% GM). This K must be determined since we want to give them an option of deciding how they want to split their reward between EQ and GM.<p>- After thinking about it seems K could just be 1.

I'll try to provide some context. I started out BBSing as a kid in the 80s, usenetting in the 90s, and I felt post '00 that the dominance of the www seemed to be fragmenting and destroying the feeling of specialness that digital communities possessed. Discovering 4chan in 2005 triggered a flash of recognition, a sense of ""aha! this is where the creative spirit of Ye Olde Nettes is!"" I've always thought the absence of personal ego and freedom of expression of 4chan at its best represents a higher ideal than voting-based communities, and paradoxically enables richer self-expression than the banalities of myspace and facebook. For years I held myself aloof from other online communities, reading them, but always reserving my participation for 4chan. Last year I finally broke down, and my very first contribution to HN discussion was to vent my frustration with the idea of making facebook accounts a prerequisite to the use of other sites!<p>tl; dr - Long time 4chan user finally compromises his internet ideals to join HN just to complain about sites piggybacking on Facebook.

Difficult of developing against that (and the natural reaction of just ""handwaving"" the consistency model rather than using optimistic locking with a vector clock at the identified synchronization points) is the main one. I have, however, also seen the situation where developers would fail to understand how to correctly deal with availability and build ad-hoc, poorly thought-out HA layers on top of non-HA systems. The typical memcache + MySQL deployment is the prime example of that: there's neither the high availability, nor an understandable consistency/cache coherence model.<p>> Note that his ""right answer"" for performance (not availability, so it's a bit of an aside from your comment) is to dynamically repartition, which is what Clustrix does. Note that we can actually do this type of repartitioning on just the ""hot"" data, using MVCC to avoid any downtime (unlike Mongo, which blocks all writes).<p>Dynamic repartitioning is also what HBase/BigTable do (""tablet splitting""). The MVCC approach is interesting way around the unavailability window, by the way.<p>> By the way, the Google Megastore project I believe you're referring to is not actually eventually consistent in the same way that, say, Cassandra is. Megastore is fully ACID within an entity group, meaning that lowering eventually consistency down to the per-node level was not the solution that Google went with. BigTable is also not eventually consistent.<p>Yes, I did not mean that Megastore is eventually consistent. It is not, it's ACID compliant and uses Paxos. Real question: was this not stated clearly in my comment (I'd like to edit to clarify if it is)?<p>Megastore, however, is an example of a ""NoSQL"" system and I meant to use it as proof that not all ""NoSQL"" systems give up consistency: ACID is orthogonal to the query language.<p>Quite frankly I find the whole query language debate (and ""NoSQL"" marketing gimmick) to be quite pointless, the distributed systems and systems programming aspects are a lot more interesting to me.",1296511741

At one point someone in the audience asked about scale and SQL. His response was ""Well, how well does SQL scale?"" Everyone in the room laughed.<p>Sell your strength, don't attack others weakness. Demonstrate how your product is actually very similar to megastore (strong consistency, use of distributed transactions) and differs only in the query language (""GQL"" itself is very similar to SQL to the point where an application developer could care less about which one is using). It looks like this is case the case (except I believe you guys are using 2PC instead of Paxos, in which case you want to clearly state the availability scenarios which Paxos addresses and at what costs).<p>Of course the problem with systems like megastore is that the overhead they introduce is seldom worth the compromises the application developers have already made. Incidentally, form what I hear, Megastore is not used very frequently outide of the app engine: application developers at Google itself are comfortable with using Spanner/BigTable directly but aren't comfortable with the additional overhead of distributed transactions as used by Megastore. App engine, customers, on the other hand aren't particularly interested in low a in the first place but aren't used to design patterns used on top of systems like BigTable.<p>By the way, I think Clustrix is a great product. I remember reading the white papers/specs when it came out and I'll make sure to scan it over again. Just why in the (imo, useless) SQL/NoSQL marketing circus rather than focus on the product's strength?<p>I personally think MongoDB is a poor comparison choice: it has the buzz, but there are some serious flaws in its distribution architecture (namely ill defined consistency and partitioning model) and the outdated disk persistence story (Mendel Rosenblum wrote his dissertation in 1992; building a log structured database is no less risky than cloning circa-1995 MyISAM).

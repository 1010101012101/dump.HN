1707843,comment,1707013,1707415,0,0,btilly,,,"I strongly agree with this point.  See <a href=""http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2009/11/why-i-left-math.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2009/11/why-i-left-math.html</a> for how what I saw in math supports your point.<p>Worse yet, we have not just specialized, we have lost knowledge as well.  My favorite example of this is a result I rediscovered.  Every mathematician knows that, for instance, sqrt(2)+cube_root(3) must be the root of some polynomial of degree 6.  (This one turns out to be x^6 - 6x^4 -6x^3 + 12x^2 - 36x + 1.)  I came up with a construction for answering questions like this.  I showed it to a number of mathematicians, and none had seen it until I showed an older one who said, ""That looks like a very old way to do this.  Go to the library, pick up an algebra book from the 1800s, and see if you find it.""<p>I did, it was there, and it turns out that two of the mathematicians I had talked to were in fields that had gotten their start from the very construction I rediscovered!  (One was in number theory, dealing with things like algebraic integers.  The other was in combinatorics, and did a lot of stuff with symmetric polynomials.)<p>If you're curious, the observation behind the construction is that any polynomial expression that is symmetric in the roots of a polynomial can be rewritten as a polynomial in the coefficients of that polynomial.  So if a1 and a2 are the roots of x^2-2, and b1, b2, b3 are the roots of x^3-3, then (x-a1-b1)(x-a1-b2)(x-a1-b3)(x-a2-b1)(x-a2-b2)(x-a2-b3) is a polynomial in x and the coefficients of x^2-2 and x^3-3, which means that it is an integer polynomial.<p>All that said, this point doesn't support your argument.  It is true that if information were better presented, people could learn more about more subjects than they could otherwise.  It is true that trying to do this would have tremendous value.  But if you want to learn about multiple subjects then you need to deal with how information actually exists out there in the world, rather than how we'd like it to be organized.  The disorganization that you point to is a significant barrier to learning.  (This problem does not look like it will improve any time soon.)",1284958704

Rather, the problem is that it is usually an indicator of other problems. It's like Van Halen's famous brown M&Ms.<p>The band Van Halen had a term in their contracts, buried in the section of technical requirements that specified things like power requirements and structural requirements for the stage and such, that required the venue to provide a bowl of M&Ms for the band, with all the brown M&Ms removed.<p>This was there not because they had anything against brown M&Ms. Its purpose was to provide a way to see if someone had actually read the technical requirements. When they arrived to set up for a show, they could walk backstage, glance at the bowl of M&Ms, and if they saw brown ones, they invariably found on closer inspection that other requirements had also been ignored--including safety requirements.<p>Same with HFCS. If you find HFCS in the ingredient list, it is usually a sign you are dealing with a food that has had a lot of processing applied to it to try to ""improve"" it, or make it cheaper at the expense of nutrition, and so on.

I think in most fields of computer science its hard to articulate the importance of the research in itself. That is I think my vague outsider view of Maths and Physics research is that its easier to quantify the significance research on its own. In CS I feel their is a stronger need for outside justification - that is this research will do x faster or better - but that research tends to be divorced from industry to the extent that it rarely contributes directly. Fundamentally there just isn't as much need for academia in lots of fields of CS - it doesn't take expensive equipment and its not so abstract that it can't be undertaken by a profit seeking concern. Add to that most universities want to take good research patent it and spin it off anyway, and you might as well just start a company and keep your equity.",1284958051

Anyone who has done freelance contracting has a grab-bag full of 'bad agent' stories.  There's massive scope for connecting potential employees and employers together and eliminating the agent in the middle.  But someone has to weed out the bad hires and process all the information, so the solution is crowdsourcing the bits and pieces that go into hiring-having a trusted resume sorter, an effective job-ad writer, etc.  I think the existing hiring model is extremely outmoded given the technology available, but the right 'new' business model hasn't emerged yet.

When you're growing your company you'll pay relatively little personal or corporate income tax.<p>That's an extremely important point.<p>I tell people:  If you want to help startups, the tax <i>rate</i> does not matter hardly at all.

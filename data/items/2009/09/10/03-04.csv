During the protests following the contested Iranian election last June, the government worked to prevent people from being able to use the internet to communicate information (especially photographs and video) of the repression to the outside world.<p>The state censorship policy in Iran is mainly implemented with transparent web proxies that identify prohibited URLs and redirect to a warning page.  Internet users in Iran have become quite adept at bypassing the filters by either using specific circumvention tools or by tunneling their traffic out over VPNs or protocols such as SSL or SSH.<p>During the protests, the Iranian authorities began to restrict access to specific protocols by throttling them down to a trickle of bytes so that business users could still access some SSL services or foreign VPNs with enough patience, but the channels were no longer usable for mass tunneling to restricted websites.<p>The traffic throttling is implemented with the same techniques that ISPs use to restrict P2P file trading traffic.

I think the question of consciousness is fundamentally unanswerable, and I think a lot of people like to use that fact to construct arguments about how consciousness and simulation of consciousness are the same thing because they are scientifically indistinguishable.  However just because a falsifiable theory can not be constructed does not mean there isn't an objective truth.<p>This need for all beliefs to have a scientific basis is a bit pathological in my opinion.  You shouldn't feel bad for believing something ""illogical"" if the only reason it is illogical is Occam's Razor or scientific intractability.<p>My reasoning for this is that it should be obvious to everyone that our world and experiences are increasingly shaped by ideas in modern times.  Even though physics can explain the mechanics of the universe in great detail, the way ideas affect our individual experiences and society as a whole has very little to do with their ability to be objectively classified as true or false.  By forcing a scientific perspective you are limiting yourself from the benefits of philosophies and ideas that are beyond the realm of science.<p>I'm not saying that a belief about artificial consciousness is beneficial one way or the other, but just that you shouldn't be chided into dismissing your own opinion just because it does not rest on firm logical conclusions based on established scientific evidence.

Each photocell is, in effect, wired in backwards, with its wire sticking out on the side nearest the light.

Arguably there are extant, albeit crude, versions of this form of machine consciousness.<p>If, on the other hand, you mean something that starts to look like qualia (i.e. ""raw feels""/""what's it's like""/""the hard problem""/etc cf. the Chalmers references already made), then no.<p>Of course, my ""no"" essentially echoes Dan Dennett's, in that I don't think people are conscious in this way, either. I suspect a lot of our ""feelings"" are internal post-hoc stories (made possible by enabled by command of private language) that rationalize/create causal attributions for the physiological correlates of stress (""four Fs"" situations).<p>That being said, I could be wrong, and finding a way to get at these hypotheses empirically would be a genuine advance, whether they were supported or refuted. So by all means pursue this...as someone else pointed out, it's likely the ""final"" answers won't be known in your lifetime, and if it brings you fulfillment in your lifetime, then giv'er.<p>As for where to apply, there are loads...some have already pointed out several researchers (Hofstadter, Koch, etc.), so you could always apply where they are.

Since the brain <i>seems</i> like all it's doing is performing some computations, why would we ever assume that its true function is to do something more than that?<p><i>And given the fact that we are discovering new properties of matter and organic reactions all the time, there is a bias towards this being false.</i><p>There's a good chance that the way the brain achieves its computations is indeed a bit more complex than, for instance, an artificial neural network, absolutely.  But that's an implementation detail, and there's certainly no reason to assume that there's no computational model that can account for it - biologists are very close to having full working models of individual neurons already.  Further, it's highly likely that the brain does its job in a biologically convenient way, not a logically convenient one, and I'd give good odds that there are a lot of logical simplifications that could be made to end up with a cleaner architecture that performs the exact same tasks.",1252553567

What happened was, what customers told us was, they started to see it as a game machine. Because a lot of the games were free on the store.

By its own definition, it is about programs, and programs are not machines. Whatever else intentionality is, it is a biological phenomenon, and it is as likely to be as causally dependent on the specific biochemistry of its origins as lactation, photosynthesis, or any other biological phenomena. No one would suppose that we could produce milk and sugar by running a computer simulation of the formal sequences in lactation and photosynthesis, but where the mind is concerned many people are willing to believe in such a miracle because of a deep and abiding dualism: the mind they suppose is a matter of formal processes and is independent of quite specific material causes in the way that milk and sugar are not.</i><p>Even if the guy's a freaking idiot (which he is), you've gotta appreciate the way he tries to turn the ""dualist"" label against the people that are most opposed to dualism, while that's almost exactly what he's arguing for.  He would have made a great politician; unfortunately, he's made his career arguing about something that he doesn't really understand, which is a damn shame, I hate to see so much mental energy spent fighting a lost battle...",1252552750

Suppose some test is set up with the end result that group A visits the site 5% less in the future, and B is unchanged. After this result is discovered, the next test is run, which is to test whether the background should be white (A) or puke green (B).<p>Now even if in actuality people don't care one way or the other about the color, it may well be discovered that group A does worse, because there are still people among this group that were exposed to the previous test and are now coming back less (or have stopped coming at all).",1252552622

814552,comment,813919,814255,0,0,trapper,,,"I'll bite. There is nothing in the design of relational databases that specifies that a record must be fixed length. Most good dbs don't do this at all, simply using something akin to:<p>Each row in your db has:<p>row size: row data<p>for each column:<p>cell size, cell data<p>In multi-value databases, which the cassandra supercolumn seems to be mimicing somewhat, your cell data can contain more cells again, and can support huge hierarchies. I like the design of these systems that keeps the relational model, but stores all related data in two places, which dramatically increases speed as you are reading related data off the same disk block. Typically this means huge performance gains as you read in large blocks (kb) off disk as it is.<p>In my opinion, having written a few multi dimensional indexing systems and db's from scratch (including a multi value db), there is little preventing a relational database becoming the best of both worlds. What do you think about the relational model makes it so ""impossible"" to scale?<p>I tend to think it's simply legacy code. Has anyone created a relational database with the goal of horizontal scalability from the outset?",1252552382

2040611,comment,2038992,2039550,0,0,rednum,,,"I don't know what was the programming like in the early days of java, but none of the original featurs of java is unique to java anymore - whereas lisp has some unique features. C is pretty bad language to compare Java to - they are designed to write different kinds of programs actually. It shouldn't be surprise that doing stuff with sockets is much harder in low level language as C. Also, threads and semaphores are two different things, (by the way, there is some threads support in C), so point (5) is simply invalid.<p>Considering lisp - I don't see what is wrong with indentation - they actually have something to do with logical structure of code, (also I don't get whats wrong with their usability - for me this 'random indented code' is readable). Speaking of too many lisps - one could as well say that there are too many C-like languages : C, C++, C#, Objective-C. They are all different languages, no some forks of 'The Lisp'. Considering books - well, I've read few of them and none mentions lambda calculus (unfortunately, I'd eagerly learn something about that) - e.g. PCL, 'On lisp'. Also, I think you completely miss the point with lambdas - they are necessary when you are using higher-order functions and naming them would be pointless.",1293375498

Make money?<p>You seemed to be suggesting this was a market that needs a service to help people get less disorganized.  There are loads of free debt calculators that will show you that by adding $X/month to a payment you'll be out of debt Y months earlier.  There's no real magic or rocket science to this.<p>Having a service that visualized all of it might be a bit motivational for some people, but doing anything that speaks to student loans is going to require work.  Which is going to requirement payment, meaning the service would need to charge money or show ads.  Neither of those sit well with me with respect to the audience - they're already self-identifying as being in debt - sometimes massively.  It just doesn't feel like a good market to try to make money from.<p>It sounds like you're looking for something that can automatically send payments on your behalf, check that they were received, and suggest when to send extra payments.

OS X is kinda like gentoo, but with more portability issues ;-) (I kid, I kid!) I don't know if I should use brew, fink, macports, etc. and if I did know, would my choice affect my users too?<p>py2app worked on leopard but doesn't work on snow leopard anymore.  That was a bummer.  The only available option is to compile it all myself and provide a separate installer just for Qt and PyQt4. I haven't gotten around to doing that yet ;-) but will do so soon.<p>Overall that will be better than py2app because using py2app meant having 40MB .app bundles. Providing a separate installer means I can ship small ~1MB installers that contain just cola and nothing else.<p>That said, I've never been satisfied with packaging on OS X.  OTOH, maybe everyone has settled on something (brew?) and I haven't gotten the memo.",1293372154

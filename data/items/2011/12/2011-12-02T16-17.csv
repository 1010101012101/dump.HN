Walmsley<p>ABSTRACT: Quantum entanglement in the motion of macroscopic solid bodies has implications both for quantum technologies and foundational studies of the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds. Entanglement is usually fragile in room-temperature solids, owing to strong interactions both internally and with the noisy environment. We generated motional entanglement between vibrational states of two spatially separated, millimeter-sized diamonds at room temperature. By measuring strong nonclassical correlations between Raman-scattered photons, we showed that the quantum state of the diamonds has positive concurrence with 98% probability. Our results show that entanglement can persist in the classical context of moving macroscopic solids in ambient conditions.",1322843834

Currently a contractor in Banking & Finance industry, working on my company around 30+ hours a week (afternoons, eves, weekends) to develop some small web apps. I've got industry experience in the market I'm aiming towards.<p>Skills are mainly technical but not development, IS, network support, data analysis. Photoshop, Advanced Excel/VB, Photography, Basic HTML, CSS, Business Plans, Technical Documentation etc.<p>Currently learning Python in my free time. I've got a deep interest in eventually becoming a proficient dev so I'm really looking for someone with an enthusiasm for it and maybe helping me a little bit! I don't expect you to do everything technical.<p>I'm looking for someone to collaborate with over several projects if the team fit is right.<p>The main app I'm working on is a web directory with an emphasis on high quality images. I've tested the market and have got paying users signing up even before the app is built! That's how I know it's time to bring it to life. I'm also building a solid mailing list of interested businesses, & constantly networking with our potential userbase.<p>I've also got a small app idea that I'm looking to put together to help my learning curve, could be achieved using Twitter API & Twitter Bootstrap. This is more 'scratch my own itch' type. It could generate revenue but I feel I could learn a lot from it.<p>I'd love for the working arrangement to go full time if the directory and subsequent apps generate sufficient revenue to support us.<p>I'm always specific & realistic with detailed ideas. I work fast & do my best to move obstacles out of the way for team members.<p>I'm at my username on gmail.com<p>Thanks.",1322842764

Sitting in a car is dead time.<p>* Get rid of your lunch hour.  Park yourself at a nearby Starbucks and add an extra hour each day of productive startup time.  Do this every day.<p>* Given your spouse's variable work schedule, my guess is that your most productive time is in the evening, after kids are in bed.  Can you shave off 2-3 hours per night?  Better managing this time is huge.<p>There may be other things that are specific to your family life that can give you 30-60 minutes here and there.

For other bands I would download their music, the artist would get 0 from me unless I went to see them live.<p>Since switching to Spotify, artists whose albums I would have'pirated' are getting a few cents which they wouldn't otherwise have got. They are winning.. if you could call a few cents winning.<p>The problem the music industry has is that non-pirates, people who otherwise would have purchased an album are switching to Spotify for recreational listening. If a CD is worth 8 to various people it means that shops, labels and artists loose about 7.90 if the person chooses Spotify instead of purchasing.<p>Artists and Labels can work around this. They can not put latest albums on Spotify. They can withdraw their music in the hopes they can negotiate a higher streaming price. Both of these would lead to more piracy.. MORE IMPORTANTLY.. this would lead to more casual listeners purchasing music and keeping the wheel's turning for labels.<p>Spotify is reducing piracy at the cost of reducing the number of non-pirates prepared to pay for music ownership.<p>Music label's say that piracy is the devil and they are missing out on millions. Spotify proves there is limited value in ending piracy. Spotify also proves there is a growing desire for people to have access to, but not ownership of, music.

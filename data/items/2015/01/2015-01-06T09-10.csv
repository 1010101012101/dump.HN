8843616,comment,8843475,8843475,0,0,canadev,,,"Saw this phone on reddit earlier.<p>A few weeks ago, after an upgrade to iOS 8, I became unable to connect to wifi on my iPhone 4S and the speed of the OS became pretty bad, after it had been perfectly responsive since I first got it nearly 3 years ago.<p>Combine this with the fact that my expensive purchased-for-durability phone case, the third in the phone&#x27;s lifetime, was starting to crack, and I started looking at other phones.<p>My contract is up in a couple of months. I went to a store and looked at the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the iPhone 6.<p>I found the Note 4 intriguing because I&#x27;ve been occasionally following John Carmack&#x27;s discussions about the Gear VR (Oculus Rift that connects to the phone) and I thought it was coming out in a consumer version, but it looks like they are still labeling it as a developer kit, which makes me think there must be a reason for that (i.e. it&#x27;s not really ready for prime time). Also, the phone is just massively huge, and I don&#x27;t want to buy it, especially since given my way of doing things I&#x27;d end up buying some horribly large case on top of it.<p>Then I looked at the iPhone 6. First of all I do think it&#x27;s too big in terms of screen size -- though I do like the thickness and weight of it quite a bit. But the base model is 16GB, and getting either a 16GB or a 64GB <i>on contract</i> was $200+ or $375+ respectively. I thought about it and almost broke down and bought a 128GB model outright for over $1000. In the end, I just couldn&#x27;t justify it.<p>I think it&#x27;s time for me to go back to sending SMSs on the telephone keypad. And time for me to stop getting warnings that my damn phone is not backing up (no wifi and me not plugging it in), time for me to stop worrying that the phone will die if I forget to charge it for just one evening, and time for me to stop buying expensive, crappy cases.<p>I really want this phone. And if I don&#x27;t get it, I&#x27;ll probably get something that is just like it.<p>TL;DR: I&#x27;m a fan.",1420538324
8843615,comment,8843415,8843415,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"This particular April Fool&#x27;s joke goes back at least 30 years. I remember getting a chuckle out of it a long time ago.<p>For context for younger readers, it might be worth pointing out that there was for a while a sort of rivalry between C and Pascal adherents. C was the more &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; language, while Pascal was a &quot;teaching&quot; language (or so some of the arguments went). Windows was coded in C, while MacOS -- before it was called MacOS -- was largely Pascal, with a lot of hand-coded 68k assembly for flavor. Pascal devotees would make fun of C in about the same way that a Python programmer might make fun of Perl. C devotees responded by writing an awful lot more code than Pascal programmers did, which eventually shut them up pretty good.<p>Pascal got a boost out of OOP, but by 1995 or thereabouts Pascal didn&#x27;t really have much of a future left, which was sort of a shame.",1420538315

Though, it becomes my problem when our customers come to us for help due to Parallels failure.<p>You say it is working as designed, I say that design is broken. Those are not mutually exclusive assertions.<p><i>&quot;You can&#x27;t really blame OpenVZ if the users or sysadmins are unaware that the container has hard limits and that you&#x27;re able to see if you&#x27;ve run into them using /proc/user_beancounters.&quot;</i><p>It is not the &quot;hard&quot; limit that is the problem...it is the &quot;soft limit&quot; which is arbitrary and can be unallocate-able, with the user having no way to know that it will be unallocate-able until it causes a service to exit. So-called &quot;burst&quot; RAM in VZ containers would better be called Schr√∂dinger&#x27;s RAM, and it has no place in a server.<p>Further, it doesn&#x27;t even seem to exclusively be a problem of &quot;burst&quot; RAM. We&#x27;ve had support requests show up on systems that had, say, 1 GB of &quot;guaranteed&quot; RAM and 2 GB of &quot;burst&quot; RAM, but still behave as though it has significantly less than 1 GB of allocate-able RAM. I&#x27;ve addressed that in my comment above, but I didn&#x27;t give an example. Perhaps this is more clear?<p>Regardless, the <i>behavior</i> of VZ containers even when they are working as designed is so user-hostile that I just can&#x27;t recommend it. Our products support OpenVZ containers, because we had a number of customers tied to the platform from before their were better alternatives, but I&#x27;ve never been fond of them.<p>If it works for you, and you don&#x27;t share your system with anyone else, go ahead and do what makes you happy. But, from my perspective, as someone supporting probably more web hosting server users than anyone else I know (except maybe some friends who work at large hosting providers and a friend who works at our largest direct competitor), I know that VZ containers cause a lot of confusion.",1420538178

</code></pre>
In other words, we take a series that converges for some values, and then see if it has an analytic continuation.  In this case it does, so we look at the value of the analytic continuation at places where the original series is not defined.<p>As a simpler example, consider 1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+...  This is not defined outside of the disk |z|<1.  However, when |z|<1 we have:<p><pre><code>   1/(1-x) = 1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+...
</code></pre>
So for x=2 we can evaluate 1/(1-x), but we can&#x27;t evaluate the infinite series.  When x=2 the value of 1/(1-x) is -1, does that mean we can say that 1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^8+... is -1?  Well, no, but sort of.<p>Playing fast and loose with these things is almost guaranteed to go wrong, but when you <i>really</i> understand what&#x27;s happening, saying things like:<p><pre><code>    1+2+3+4+5+6+... = -1/12

8843490,comment,8832006,8834454,0,0,ianamartin,,,"Some thoughts about what crosses over:<p>One of the most unexpected things to me is how good I am at hitting deadlines. But it makes sense. As a musician, deadlines don&#x27;t move. You&#x27;re playing a concerto with an orchestra on such and such a day . . . that concert is going to happen whether you are ready or not. Your choices are to get up there and play like a badass or get up there and fail in front of a thousands of people. You learn that when you&#x27;re 8, and it sticks with you. When I moved over to coding, I never thought twice about it. A deadline is a deadline. It doesn&#x27;t move. That&#x27;s a thing that&#x27;s been consistently talked about in my career. I nail my deadlines. Not because of any magic about me as a programmer, just a mental inability to view those as flexible. I can see, however, that this would be a weakness for me if I were to get into management: I&#x27;m awfully impatient with people who don&#x27;t hit deadlines.<p>Dealing with toxic environments. I read about brogrammers and silicon valley startups with all kinds of ego problems and sexism all the time. We all do. I&#x27;ve even worked for a startup or two that styled itself that way. I&#x27;ve never met anyone with the kind of ego that professional musicians have. Not all, mind you. It&#x27;s been my experience that the best people in any field are quite kind and wonderful and humble. And the worst are the ones who are actually just mediocre. But there are tons of mediocre performers who have terrible sexist, racist, and generally toxic attitudes. I managed an orchestra while I was studying statistics after I dropped out of my music degree because it seemed like a good idea. I&#x27;ve never seen such a wretched hive of scum and villainy. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, even the most obnoxious of the party-boy, popped-collar, douchebag bros I&#x27;ve ever worked with are basically nothing compared to you run-of-the-mill regional orchestra player jerk.<p>Being willing to learn from anyone. There are many musicians (particularly string players) who subscribe to a certain philosophy of playing. All other methods of playing are ipso facto wrong. My best teacher is a violinist, Bruce Berg, who studied with Galamian, Gingold, and Dorothy DeLay. He did an undergrad, grad, and doctorate at the Julliard School. Where he claims to have learned very little (I doubt this is true). After finishing his doctorate, he went and studied with a Cellist--heresy!--named George Neikreug. What could a violinist with these credentials possibly have to learn from a Cellist? To this day, Bruce claims that he never actually learned to play the violin well until he studied with George. I&#x27;ve taken that same approach, (and I picked up a lot of George&#x27;s techniques from Bruce), both in music and in technology, and I think it has served me well. Go to the dark side for advice some times. Go learn a language that you don&#x27;t like. Go talk to people you don&#x27;t think have anything to offer you. Go with an open mind and a warm heart. And a couple hundred bucks. Because people often charge money for their knowledge. But I&#x27;ve learned as much about programming from reading Marco Arment talk about how he does all his web apps in PHP because his needs are simple as I have learned from reading Eevee about how much PHP is a hammer with the claw part on both ends.<p>I could continue on about this just as much as the earlier topic. But I should probably shut it down. So I&#x27;ll close with this:<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid to contact big important people and ask them for help. I remember when I was just learning python, I was writing an extension for SPSS to do some statistical junk that we couldn&#x27;t do with the interface as it existed. So I just went and wrote one that shouldn&#x27;t have worked but did and emailed him the code and asked why it worked. I got completely schooled by a total master. It didn&#x27;t really work. Slightly embarrassing, but since I didn&#x27;t bring an ego to that situation, I learned a ton. John Peck is a really great guy.",1420535694

8843485,comment,8832006,8834454,0,0,ianamartin,,,"Here are a few things off the top of my head about practicing. And I do think there&#x27;s quite a lot of crossover as well.<p>Practice thoughts:<p>Have a plan when you sit down (or stand up) to practice. Know what you want to accomplish. This gets more and more important the older you get and the less time you have. When I was a kid, I practiced for 5 or more hours a day. Even more in college. As an adult with a job and a girlfriend, I will never have that luxury again. But what I do have is 15 minutes here and 20 minutes there. It is FAR from optimal, but that&#x27;s what you have to work with. I do still get up early before work so I can practice scales for an hour every morning. That might be all I can do for one day. But even with scales, have a goal.<p>It helps to do this if you have thought about the piece you want to work on and what you think you need to do. It&#x27;s hard to generalize because you are so often in different places. But give yourself a goal, break it up into manageable tasks, and check them off the list. I&#x27;m learning the Shostakovitch violin concerto right now to play with an orchestra in a few months. Each day of the week my schedule is different. Some days, I&#x27;m going to yoga after work; some days, I&#x27;m driving an hour to my gf&#x27;s place, sometimes, I just go home. This week, I&#x27;ll have a few 15-20 minutes time slots, and I&#x27;ll have 1 2-hour slot. I prefer to work the &quot;hardest&quot; parts in the smallest time slots. I&#x27;ll take those 2-3 short times and work a single measure that&#x27;s tricky. I&#x27;ll take the longer time slot and work on performing a larger chunk.<p>I was a violin performance/music theory/philosophy major in school (and dropped out after 6 years, of course). So it&#x27;s natural for me to analyze the music I&#x27;m playing to get the best understanding of it I can. You don&#x27;t have to be a music theorist to have some grasp of the form and structure of a bit of music you want to learn. Read about the music online. Understand it the best you can. This will help you remember it. I break up my practice goals when I&#x27;m doing the initial analysis of the music.<p>One good reason to do some analysis before you practice is to understand what parts are similar and what parts are different. Abstract the challenges as much as possible. If you are working on a piece in f#-minor, practice a lot of scales in f#-minor so that you have that key in your ear and your fingers and don&#x27;t have to worry so much about intonation in general. If it follows a standard form, you&#x27;ll spend some time in A-major and there will be at least some C#-Major(!). Practice those scales as well before you sit down to do the hard work. Composers tend to reuse material. Take the time to figure out what the composer is doing over time with the musical components, and you will save a ton of time in your practice.<p>In the classical world, the number one biggest priority is playing in tune. It doesn&#x27;t matter what else you do or can do or what you can feel about the music or anything else: if you don&#x27;t play in tune--and I mean really well in tune--no one cares. We are hyper-attuned to this because of recording technology that lets anyone sound like they can play perfectly in tune. In reality, no one does. No one even really agrees on what &quot;in tune&quot; means these days. But if you don&#x27;t do it, you&#x27;ve got nothing. So! Train your ears. Spend some time, at least once a month doing exercises that are designed to maximize your ability to detect small changes in pitch. I apologize in advance to wind and brass players, I don&#x27;t know what the analog is for this exercise. Obviously, this isn&#x27;t relevant to fretted instruments.<p>The &quot;ear cleaner&quot; is an exercise you can do that will make you crazy obsessive about intonation. It&#x27;s very simple. Start on a pitch. A fingered pitch; not an open string. You have to have total control for this. But it doesn&#x27;t really matter which one because this isn&#x27;t a finger exercise. It&#x27;s an ear exercise. Now what you are going to do is gradually--and in even divisions--move from the pitch you are on to a pitch one half step above it. Over the course of 8 even bow strokes. So for each bow stroke, you are going to increment your pitch by 1/8 of 1/2 of a whole tone. It&#x27;s very difficult. The point isn&#x27;t so much that you be able to execute it perfectly so much as it is to get you to listen <i>that</i> closely. And when you practice this for 5-10 minutes, you&#x27;ll hate yourself a little because <i>everything</i> will sound out of tune.<p>If there is a part of the linked article I agree with, it is practicing in smaller portions. I really don&#x27;t think that randomizing is a good idea. But planning small segments is a great idea. The important thing to remember is that you are developing muscle memory. If you are practicing mindlessly, you are probably practicing something wrong. Which means you will be reinforcing something wrong. I suggest this: do not practice for any longer than you can maintain total focus on the thing you are trying to improve. There are too many things to think about already. If you are as planned and focused and you should be, you are still only working on one aspect of your technique, and others are not being executed properly. Choose one thing. Do it well. Stop as soon as you lose focus.<p>I could keep going on for a very long time, but I&#x27;ll close the practice notes on this: remember to practice performing. Performing is a completely different mental exercise than practicing. When we practice, we have to be very acutely attuned to all of our little (or big) errors, and we need to note them for future reference because our ears and minds are the only error-checking mechanisms that we have (aside from audio recorders, which are a VERY good idea when practicing performing). But performing is different. You cannot and should not be thinking or hearing in the same way when you perform. When you perform you have to be focused on the music that you want to make (that you planned out, right?! Back when you analyzed the piece before you started practicing), and you can&#x27;t let the inevitable mistake distract you from your performance or shake your confidence. You can&#x27;t think in small chunks of technical execution one note or measure at a time. You have to think bigger than that. And you have to be listening to the other people you are playing with and responding to what they are doing. You don&#x27;t have time for you when you perform. Performing is all about other people. You have to practice getting into that mindset and practice forgetting about what you are doing when you play. It&#x27;s an entirely different skill. So practice that one too.",1420535549

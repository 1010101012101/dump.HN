I should point out that he's not an old man, as his username might imply, but rather someone who is simply obsessed with Frank Sinatra and my gorgeous rockin hard ass.<p>Anyway, when I broke up with him he took it pretty badly. It was our Sophomore year at Rice University and I had just discovered gravity bongs and going down on another girl while blazed out of my gord. As I've admitted, these were confusing albeit fun times for me.<p>Meanwhile, ""Frank"" was raised as a Mormon but had recently converted to Scientology. I guess you might say he was experimenting with his own hallucinogenic homoerotic drug. This drug/sex/cult cocktail, combined with my round pulchritudinous derriere, and the sudden shock of losing his ability to play his daily role of dressing up as Dr. Parnassus while gently fondling my perky nipples and supple breasts that he had affectionately named the Merry Mammary Sisters of Nippopolis, and Queens of the Breastiary - led to Frank's complete mental breakdown.<p>I don't blame Frank for my rockin body, just as I don't blame you for being attracted to my intelligence and funding my project on Kickstarter. However, what I do not like is being stalked. I hope you all do what I do when you see Frank's messages on any thread related to my project. Just lick your index finger, point it at Frank's username and then say, ""Ooooooooooooo ICE COLD! Mama thinks you're a BAAAAD BOYYYY! OOOOOO Ice Cold..."" then point the same finger back at your left nipple and make a sizzling sound ""SSSSSssssssssssss"" and sing this little rap<p>Thank you all again for funding my project on Kickstarter.

What that is depends greatly on the app and the team, I guess (which is another way of saying that I suck at marketing). Some apps like Sparrow seem to be doing consistently well on the MAS thanks to a successful launch hype on tech blogs and social networks, but not everyone can do that.<p>Btw, your app looks really great at least on the typeli.com site. I think the price is a bit steep, though. For me, 15 USD is too much for an impulse purchase when I have no idea whether I'm actually going to use the app.<p>If you don't want to lower the price, maybe you could do a half-price launch promo? That seems to be a popular thing (but I have no idea how well it actually works).",1334411001
3840816,comment,3840340,3840552,4,0,disgruntledphd2,,,"Um, on your point about the paper being an opinion piece, and thus not important, I would respectfully suggest that you are wrong. The author is John Ionnadis and he has published a number of meta-analyses demonstrating this problem. \n<a href=""http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=JPA+Ioannidis&btnG=Search&as_sdt=0%2C5&as_ylo=&as_vis=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=JPA+Ioannidi...</a>\nCheck out all the articles on the first page, he's been working in this area for a long time.<p>The author of the piece also identifies a massive, massive problem with science. The problem is essentially, tenure is hard to get, and many people want it. Tenure is dependent on highly cited papers in good journals. These journals have a bias toward significant results which pushes scientists to data-dredge looking for any significant result.<p>His system of pre-registration (which could be done on the ArXiV model, no government required) would allow us to have a much better idea of the things we're trying to study.<p>My field (psychology, though I suspect the problem is just as bad in other areas) has a massive problem in this area, as a counter-intuitive result gets published in a good journal, while high quality replications which show no significant effects either don't get published or get published in a much lower ranking journal.<p>This kind of registration becomes even more important when there are commercial interests riding on the outcome of a study, as in clinical trials. This (and the scandals) is presumably why such a system exists for clinical trials.<p>Finally, I don't see how registering studies and their designs before running the tests creates a centralised approach to science. The research is all planned beforehand (for ethics committees at the very least), so there's no extra work involved. It also increases our trust in results, as the ones which make it through were predicted in advance, while the weird findings can be replicated.<p>On a personal level, I can see the pressures to hypothesise after the results are known (HARK) and with tenure decisions looming, I can understand why people do it. Its horribly wrong, so this system would at least cut down on that behaviour.<p>Full disclosure: almost every time I carry out research, the results are opposite to what I expect, so I am a somewhat biased participant in this debate.",1334410972

3840777,comment,3837264,3840035,3,0,gnosis,,,"I've read that the average pay raise from the company you're already working for is about 10%.<p>While the average increase in salary when you start a new job is about 20%.<p>I think the differences are usually even more dramatic near the beginning of most people's careers.  Entry level employees tend to be extremely underpaid and undervalued.<p>With at least one year of experience under your belt, your worth on the job market is significantly higher than someone who's fresh out of college.  But the company with which you've been working at since college rarely sees it that way, and tends to undervalue you.  If you switch jobs, you are almost guaranteed a significantly higher salary -- even more so with two or three years under your belt.<p>In my own case, I managed to more than double my salary in about three years of job hopping about once a year at the start of my career.  Of course, simple math will tell you you can't keep that sort of thing for long (unless you're one of the few to win the career lottery and make C__ at a successful company).  So eventually your salary increases will start to plateau, and you might even price yourself out of the job market entirely -- making your current job (the one willing to pay top market rates) that much more valuable for you to keep.  But when you're just starting out, and even in the middle of your career, this won't be much of a concern.",1334409806

Who designs what the access layer looks like? Doesn't that require that you set up your users' accounts in a Firebase specific way so that they can have appropriate permissions in the access layer (which is server-side, by definition)?<p>And that's only considering actual authorization to change data on the server. One of the comments below mentions business logic that shouldn't be tampered with, like discounts. How can any business logic at all be entrusted to the client to perform?",1334409409

The author says he published five books through traditional publishers and had a ""weekly column in The Financial Times"", so it's basically impossible to say if self-publishing is good for you if you don't already have that background.<p>Or, consider the proffered scenario: 'Then when you meet someone and they ask for your business card, how cool will it be when you can say, ""here, take my book instead.""'<p>Not cool at all. My uncle was like that. He wrote a book and tried to get anyone else to read it. I couldn't get past the first few pages.

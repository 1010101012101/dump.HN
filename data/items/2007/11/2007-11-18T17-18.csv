I'm also not good at web design nor do I have good contacts among top web 2.0 bloggers.  <p>And from my startup prototypes so far, I have learned that most users have very little patience, understand little, and generally don't contribute much.<p>For these reasons, toy Facebook apps seem to be my best bet.  I also like the idea of playing with people's minds, easily tweaking things here and there to see what sort of psychological/sociological impact they will have, etc. ",1195408760
81250,comment,81203,81243,0,0,marcus,,,"That was the point I was trying to make. Perhaps you get easier access to liquidity and can gather users a tad faster but in the end you have very little control. You don't own the liquidity you are borrowing it, you don't even have a TOS contract (at least that one that I could find) with facebook, they can shut you down without any warning.<p>Even if you can make a very profitable app, imagine trying to IPO a facebook app... How do you think investors would evaluate the risk.<p>I can understand developing a facebook app as a part of a more comprehensive strategy as a complimentary tool to your website. That might be a very powerful tactic but as a standalone product, I just don't get it.<p>Again if anyone understands this differently I'd love to finally see what I am missing here...",1195408629
81249,comment,80933,81009,0,0,Tichy,,,"That just seems like very bad practice. System.gc() usually does not do anything, and it might seem as if a lot of memory is being used. Usually the gc kicks into gear if the memory is really needed, though. <p>Don't know the OS X jvm, but it can't be THAT bad...<p>I had some troubles with mobile phone JVMs, usually manually setting all pointers to null was doing the trick, though. <p>In any case, I wouldn't blame Java for some bad implementations of jvms.

81243,comment,81203,81203,0,0,lanej0,,,"What's the revenue model on a Facebook app?  You're getting a tiny piece of advertising pie?  Sorry, but building a company based off of what amounts to a plugin for someone else's software just doesn't seem like a good idea to me...<p>... that said, I guess it was done with PhotoShop a bunch of times.  But people had to pay up front for that software.<p>Or are we returning to the dot com days where revenue doesn't matter -- it's all about pageviews?",1195407527

It's a social voting website that combines polling with Web 2.0.",1195406212
81234,comment,81172,81219,0,0,dood,,,"Heh, I had the same idea, probably because I enjoy arguing and finding flaws in arguements so much. If anyone does start this up, let me know, I'll help! However, I suspect the market for telling people what they want to hear is much bigger ;)<p>The origin of the term 'Devil's advocate' is interesting,
""Formerly, during the canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church, the Promoter of the Faith, or Devil's Advocate, was a canon lawyer appointed by the Church to argue against the canonization of the candidate. It was his job to take a skeptical view of the candidate's character, to look for holes in the evidence, to argue that any miracles attributed to the candidate were fraudulent, etc. The Devil's advocate was opposed by God's advocate, whose job was to make the argument in favor of canonization.""

5082287,comment,5081442,5081442,1,0,JamesMcMinn,,,"Not in the slightest.<p>I went into the degree having done a lot of programming and found the first year of CS fairly easy. However, I was lucky as Glasgow allows you to switch between degrees almost at will as long as you meet the requirements for it during the first 2 years (1st year courses generally only make up 1/3rd of the credits, and 2nd year courses make up 1/2 of the credits for that year).This meant that I was able to peruse Maths, Physics and CS in my first year, and Electrical Engineering and CS during my second year - it was only in the final 2 years that CS became my only focus.<p>Essentially, I didn't need to decide which degree I would do until the start of my 3rd year, by which point the course had ramped up to the 4 hours sleep per night level, I was loving every moment of being pushed to the edge, and I was very sure that CS was the right choice for me.<p>Practically speaking, I came out of the degree having covered a bit of just about everything, and in a position to quickly learn anything that I don't already know. I probably could have become better at programming, but a much less capable thinker if I'd spent the 4 years working.<p>I don't think that every developers needs a CS degree, however I'd say that if you want to tackle really hard problems, the ones that most people wouldn't even dream of solving, then a CS degree is probably the best tool in your box.",1358560797

C declaration is not easy for beginners but surely is one of the most important subjects towards optimisations. Correct usage of const and restrict keywords let compiler optimise your code super fast for free.
Check my post for example usage of type qualifiers and how the syntax is structured in C:

The article mentions that the C code is too disconnected from the real hardware which, in this case, has multiple cores.<p>Do you need to call (non portable?) code setting mutexes manually? (not that it would be a problem)<p>How do you use the CPU's underlying CAS operation?  (by inline assembly?)<p>As an example: the guys who wrote the very fast LMAX disruptor pattern in Java relied on the fact that Java does provide methods inside the AtomicXXX classes calling CAS operations under the hood.  But sadly they couldn't ""pick"" the one operation they'd like, which would have been faster than the one Java decided to use (it's a RFE if I recall correctly: they'd like Oracle to modify Java so that it uses the faster version when it makes sense).<p>I take it that in C you can inline assembly and do as you want!?",1358560425

Since you are trying to sell this to us, why not try and make this idea appeal to us? To say that someone needn't bother if the abstract idea you've presented doesn't seem to work for them... that's pretty weak and (forgive me if I'm misinterpreting) even comes off as arrogant. If you have a specific user base in mind, fine, but then say so. Those who have posted so far haven't a clue the benefit they are getting out of it. You might have a great product, but it never will be great if people don't know about it/use it because it affects your bottom line. Instead of brushing off this person's valid point, why not try and convince us about how ""fun and interesting"" your product is? What about more specific use cases? Not just ""here's my product. Try it.""<p>Overall, the reason the value is requested here is that we need to understand beyond what your new product actually does. Why is it making our lives better? Why should we want/need to go to it? Is the intent to solve some fundamental need or frustration? If so, how does it do that?<p>The difference between your product and pure Google Earth is that Google Earth was made by a large company that is exploring many different avenues, with an already established financial base. Were you looking to monetize this particular product in some way?",1358558235

5212824,comment,5212731,5212731,3,0,argimenes,,,"In my experience it is not unusual that an intelligent, ambitious, and creative person finds themselves at a crossroad in their late twenties.  Perhaps it began in adolescence, even childhood, where they knew that they had an above-average intelligence and a mind open to possibilities -- but, at the same time, a grave sense of self doubt existed, which only grew year by year as ambitious projects floundered and others (who to appearances were less intelligent or at least less imaginative) thrived. This can reach a crisis point in the late twenties, when the options for avoidance begin to dry up -- and one is faced with the increasing reality of finding work, starting a career, etc.<p>This can be a frightening moment -- but it is also a liberating moment, viewed correctly. At this point the self's ego-image -- the set of core beliefs about who you are, what you are destined for, how 'intelligence' and 'success' are defined -- come into conflict with the reality principle.  This is naturally a very painful moment (drawn across months and even years).  It is also an opportunity to redefine these core beliefs -- to reexamine them -- to ask yourself what are your fundamental assumptions about intelligence, creativity, success.<p>In my own experience, and watching similar-minded friends, this crisis point is a fundamental conflict between what we THINK intelligence, creativity, and genius is -- and what we actually see in ourselves. On the one hand we ""know"" that we are smart, imaginative -- on the other, the reality principle demands proof and evidence.  But here is the paradox: this very belief in intelligence creates its own contradictions.  For example, if you believe that smart people are smart because they do clever things easily -- then your brain can start to believe that if you find something hard to do, it is proof of your stupidity. The brain then finds ways to avoid this painful conflict between ego-image and reality -- by dreaming up great ambitions and projects, but then shying away from realising them. Or, you can develop an aversion to ""lesser work"" -- which reinforces a belief that you are innately special and ""above that"".<p>The problem is in the core assumptions one makes about worth -- examining these assumptions deeply, being open to see the paradoxes in them, the hypocrisies even, can reveal avenues out of the situation.  You can find practical things to do -- this in turn can build real confidence, not ego-confidence. Work seems then less like 'drudgery' and more like the slow and steady strengthening of your powers.<p>Just some thoughts...",1360760385

5212788,comment,5212207,5212558,2,0,mcintyre1994,,,"Thanks for replying.<p>Your idea of only increasing in small steps is interesting, and I can see why you'd do it like that. I imagine $1/user fully scaling is probably impossible - it's probably unfair to compete when Atlassian might even be running Bitbucket at a loss and you presumably have no other major products under the same company. I can see how you'd be better value in some way at certain boundaries in price points - but I'm not convinced you'd ever become cheaper. I haven't drawn the graph, but if you used the full 25-50 jump, going from 25-50 users eventually, thats a $75 increase on your service. I see where you're coming from, but the scalar of 3x per user is probably too high for them jumps to become significant.<p>Fair enough, Bitbucket does have a free one, but I haven't used Jira which is obviously more powerful. You may well be better there.<p>And again, allowing self hosting is a really cool move. I'd definitely consider it because I think the cost, even with Bitbucket, would soon become significant compared to the one time cost of a server.<p>In all honesty, I might be being completely unfair. I'm comparing Bitbucket alone and it's main options. You have teams, Bitbucket does, but yours could well be better - maybe Atlassian's Confluence is a fairer comparison. Same with issue tracking, Bitbucket does have it, but maybe you compare better with Jira. If you would say your service compares fairly to Bitbucket, though, I don't really know how you can improve it short of cutting the $3/user/month, which I imagine isn't a reasonable request. If that's not going to happen, which I'd expect is the case, the way you scale is probably fairest.<p>I would say to look at the business package and what you're offering though - if it competes with Confluence you're priced fairly, but if it competes with Bitbucket's standard team features, I think that's significantly overpriced.",1360759737

5212785,comment,5212186,5212475,14,0,Toenex,,,"I think I'm right in saying that by emailing you a copy of the PDF, many authors are breaking their contract with the publisher.  It's a few years since I published an academic paper but I've certain signed over my rights more times that I care to recall.  So while you can get a copy of the paper from the author officially that is not allowed.  Thankfully most academics are not dickheads about this.<p>The key problem with journals is that much of what they do has been made obsolete over the last couple of decades by the move to electronic document distribution and the wonders of the WWW.  Don't forget we are talking about private companies restricting the publication of academic research much of which has been funded out of the public coffers.  Even the peer review is done, for free by academics.  All that is left is the management of the process and distribution of the publications both of which I'd wager could be handled by the communities themselves as beautifully and repeatedly demonstrated by open source software projects.<p>What the journals still retain is essentially kudos, but in a very real sense as academics are largely measured against their publication performance of which the 'currency' is the impact factor of the Journal.  Academics need to publish in those Journals with a high impact factor so that their departments get a good rating and thus get more government funding (at least here in the UK). The key will be for a community lead Journal to attain a decent impact factor.  Soon.",1360759702

A Brazil/Miami return flight is also around $1000 depending on the time of year. So theoretically it's cheaper for Brazilians to go to Miami, have a nice weeklong vacation, buy a Macbook Retina, iPhone, iPod, iPad, clothes, and much more, than buy a single Macbook here and still wait for shipping. The problem is the government/customs knows that and thus catches and taxes a lot of people who try to bring over $500USD worth of products.

5212634,comment,5212597,5212597,1,0,stevederico,,,"Hey everyone, I put together a library to help make iOS client/server apps. It's a combo of SDScaffoldKit, a scaffolding framework for iOS, AFNetworking + AFIncrementalStore, a great data syncing framework, and the heroku-core-data-buildpack. This project wouldn't be possible without the great open-source work of Mattt Thompson and the Heroku team.<p>It's not a silver bullet, but it's a great way to start your next iOS project. The code created is something you can actually build on top of without being locked into a platform. You can even change the server out for any REST-based endpoint. Plus, it's free and open-source. I created a screencast to show how it all works. I would love to hear what you think. Happy coding :)<p>Screencast Demo - <a href=""http://vimeo.com/59389685"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/59389685</a>",1360757046

It makes more sense to single out the US if they are the only one with much lower prices than everything else, instead of talking about every country where it is more expensive - in this case, most if not all countries in the world.<p>It's the exception to the rule that is interesting, and in this case, the exception is the US.",1360757023

Our problem is that the small wordpress projects quickly eat up the repo quota.<p>The price isn't a problem, but their largest plan only gives 125 repos, which we'll reach relatively quick at this rate. Enterprise is not an option, as we're not really interested in hosting and maintaining it ourselves.<p>They do however say ""If you need a plan larger than Platinum, contact us for details about our larger business plans."" Does anyone have any details about what their larger business plans consist of?<p>Most likely we'll eventually migrate to Bitbucket.",1360756966

5212624,comment,5212313,5212401,14,0,Nursie,,,"Australia is extremely expensive for a lot of stuff. Europe is too, but less so (having lived in both).<p>Part of this is that the AUD has appreciated in value so much over the last few years, and retailers are just not willing to drop their prices in line with the new purchasing power of the dollar. They also haven't caught up with the modern world in a lot of ways, considering that they still have a captive audience that can't just order off the 'net.<p>Part of this is down to protectivist legislation, for instance the price of books over there is huge and that is in part due to measures put in place to protect local authors and publishers. The net result though is that bookshops go out of business because people just get stuff online, delivered from other parts of the world. There are also weird legally-backed 'exclusive importer' agreements that result in the same phenomenon with other goods.<p>Part of the problem is retail rental rates are so high that traditional retailers have to have high prices, and in Oz the online services are usually run by the same folks. So again, business goes abroad.<p>Part of the problem is that some foreign businesses (Blizzard, I'm looking at you) just gouge Australians. Starcraft II was a hundred bucks to buy online from Australia!<p>So there's a whole culture of stuff just being expensive over there. The government needs to clean up their own act, but looking at what the private sector tries to pull is also interesting.<p>Incidentally Apple seemed to me to be one of the few organisations that were not overpriced over there, comparing US and AU prices on their store it was always pretty even (when tax was accounted for)",1360756923

You can even use both for a single project. Push your public branches to Github, accept patches, then base a private product on the result [just some extra non-pushed-to-public branches] and work on that in Bitbucket. For example, you could have, say, the Chromium codebase on Github, and then Chrome on Bitbucket.<p>[1] Well, okay, Bitbucket is also pretty good for doing deploys from: you can CNAME git.yourcompany.com to them, set up some Deploy Keys and Deploy Hooks, and it'll feel just like you had your own internal repo server for your deploy server to talk to.",1360756816

Actually can change it.<p>My personal belief is that all three are no.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not Muslim but those questions scare me. What if we fail?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, many civil rights movements faced the same obstacles and persevered. Consider how black leaders felt, how LGBT leaders felt: They were advocating for minorities whom it was politically and socially acceptable to openly despise.<p>Here&#x27;s Martin Luther King writing from jail:<p>&quot;First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&#x27;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&#x27;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &quot;order&quot; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: &quot;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&quot;; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&#x27;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &quot;more convenient season.&quot; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.&quot;<p>Somehow it turned around; I don&#x27;t know how it happens. Look at the tidal wave for gay rights recently.",1404885588

I have a classmate who works at Bridgewater, and has since graduation (well, graduation plus the six months of unemployment it took to find a job).  He got there by e-mailing everybody in the Amherst alumni directory who worked in finance and asking if they&#x27;d give him a job, and an alum at Bridgewater was the only person who responded affirmatively.  Now, he ultimately got the job through the alumni network, which is  a tool that wouldn&#x27;t be available to someone who didn&#x27;t go to school - but his path was still full of rejection, stress, and closed doors.<p>I suspect that college does help skew peoples reactions toward you favorably, but that the ability to hustle ultimately matters more to your long-term success.

I wrote some code a long time ago, and a new coworker who started about a month ago comes up to me and proposes an alternate solution. He asked why we didn&#x27;t do it this way instead of the way we were doing it now. In his mind, his solution made perfect sense.<p>I knew I was right, and I knew my solution was the best solution, because I&#x27;d spent months thinking of all the possible ways to solve the problem, and this was the best of them all.<p>But the point is that he asked, and the point is that I had to revisit that decision. I considered what he said, and I explained my rationale for going with my solution. By the time I was done, he was nodding along and saying &quot;Yeah, that makes perfect sense.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s okay to be right and to know you&#x27;re right, but if someone questions you, or if a test fails, or if conversions go down, you should be willing to stop and re-examine your assumptions, and if necessary, explain them again.<p>I&#x27;m very glad my coworker brought his ideas to me, because it validates that my solution was, in fact, correct. And if my solution hadn&#x27;t been the best choice, he would have brought a better solution. So in the end, it&#x27;s a win-win...<p>Assuming you&#x27;re wrong at first blush is almost always the right move.

It may be that your instructions were unclear, or maybe it&#x27;s a client-side issue (like an ad-blocker) that you can&#x27;t reproduce. Or maybe your customer really is a moron.<p>But before I ever go back to someone and tell them I&#x27;m good, I make sure all my ducks are in a row.

This hadith provides the context for the Qur’anic verse (4:24):<p>The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain.  They met their enemy and fought with them.  They defeated them and took them captives.\nSome of the Companions of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) were reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers.  So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur’anic verse: (Sura 4:24) &quot;And all married women (are forbidden) unto you save those (captives) whom your right hands possess.&quot; (Abu Dawud 2150, also Muslim 3433)<p>Actually, as the hadith indicates, it wasn&#x27;t Muhammad, but &quot;Allah the Exalted&quot; who told the men to rape the women in front of their husbands - which is all the more reason not to think of Islam as being the same as other religions.&quot;<p>&quot;There are several other episodes in which Muhammad is offered the clear opportunity to disavow raping women - yet he instead offers advice on how to proceed.  In one case, his men were reluctant to <i>devalue their new slaves for later resale by getting them pregnant</i>.  Muhammad was asked about coitus interruptus in particular:<p>&quot;O Allah&#x27;s Apostle! We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their <i>prices</i>, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?&quot;  The Prophet said, &quot;Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence.” (Bukhari 34:432)\nAs indicated, the prophet of Islam did not mind his men raping the women, provided they ejaculated within the bodies of their victims.&quot;<p>The references are to the actual &quot;holy texts&quot; of Islam and can be easily checked online.

In every other language that I can think of, you try to handle all errors immediately when they happen, whether that be an explicit check like in C or Go, or through some kind of exception system.<p>In Erlang/Elixir, your programs should be designed such that each process performs a small enough task that if it crashes unexpectedly, you can &quot;recover&quot; by restarting it. This idea is complemented by the shunning of side effects.<p>If you do it right, you end up writing wildly different programs in erlang/elixir than you would in other languages.<p>That said, erlang is specialized for a certain kind of problem, and if you&#x27;re not building large-scale distributed systems, you probably won&#x27;t as much out of erlang.

From a purely utilitarian point of view it makes sense to monitor or even confine such people, but from a libertarian (philosophical) point of view, we could not subject them to penal confinement as people can hardly be held criminally liable for deficiencies in their own brain structure, which might be the result of genetics, malnutrition, or childhood trauma.<p>Some sort of medical incarceration is the obvious alternative, but this is legally problematic. A Supreme Court case <i>O&#x27;Connor v. Donaldson</i> (1975) (among others, but this is the big one) made it very difficult to commit someone for confinement in a mental institution without clear evidence that they present a danger to society. Arguably, the US went putting people in mental institutions too casually and without regards for their rights, to a position of not providing sufficient mental health services for all but the most unhinged patients. While this technological advance might one day provide a reliable gauge of a person&#x27;s homicidal capability, that&#x27;s a long way from identifying how or when such behavior might manifest.<p>At a less extreme case than confining someone, should we allow someone with a measurable homicidal tendency to purchase guns? If we forbid them doing so, how do we avoid a tiered approach to citizenship, in which the rights of some are abrogated pre-emptively through no fault of their own actions, but a &#x27;fault in their stars&#x27;?<p>From a different angle, this is also an interesting result for attorneys involved in death penalty defensive work - if MRI scans, which the courts and public are highly familiar with, can reliably predict homicidal characteristics, then the question of criminal responsibility becomes much more difficult to answer, since people have no control over the structures of their own brains.",1404882092

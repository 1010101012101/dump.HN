The first phone to feature ICS will be the Galaxy Nexus which will begin being sold around mid-November. In the past it has taken around a month for the previous gen Nexus to get the OS update. I'm holding out hope that the Nexus S will get the update by mid-December, but that is just speculation. As for other carriers and manufactures, there is no telling when upgrades may come. Upgrading people's phones with a better OS does not exactly help sell phones so I'd bet a longer wait for those without a Nexus S.",1320613162

They have to be doing more or better work to justify their higher cost, which should then get factored into the review. Not necessarily closing 30% more bugs or whatever; it could just be that they're the go-to person for the hardest problems, or a repository of institutional knowledge (for long-term employees), but it has to be <i>something</i>. I would guess $5k doesn't register on that scale to get you kicked into a higher bar for reviews, though; $115k and $120k look like roughly the same kind of compensation tier.",1320613139

So far, my favorite thing I have learned is on page 14 - the snoob function.<p>Snoob stands for ""same number of one bits"". Essentially, if x is an integer whose binary representation contains n one-bits, snoob(x) will return the next smallest integer which is also represented using n one-bits. The obvious application here is iterating through all subsets of a certain size. The function is as follows:<p>unsigned int snoob(unsigned int x) {<p><pre><code>    unsigned int smallest, ripple, ones = 0;

    smallest = x & -x;

    ripple = x + smallest;

    ones = x ^ ripple;

    ones = (ones >> 2) / smallest;

    return ripple | ones;
</code></pre>
}<p>Given a set containing N elements, to generate all subsets of size K you initialize a bitmask to (1 << K) - 1 then perform a snoob N Choose K times to get all the bitmasks you need.<p>(Disclaimer: Although neat, I've never found a use for this outside of programming competitions)",1320613122

If you're ""in the area"" it's really easy to pickup a few coffee meetings and eventually one of them will lead to something bigger.<p>When you meet with them be completely up front about your situation in the US, but DO NOT dwell on why the last job offer failed. Talk about their company/products/space- show that you've done your homework. That should lead to discussions on your passions/experience and if you've researched them and they have a position open, great! If not it's perfectly ok to ask them about other companies looking for someone with your talents.<p><i>Edit</i>

And I respect the opinion of everyone who has an opinion, but there is one topic which I have never seen discussed, and it arises from the fact that bigger companies have more money. If you are working for companies like google, amazon, facebook, IBM etc you get a lot of opportunities that only money can buy. Traveling the world being one, high salary and holidays being two, we should throw in working on much larger projects as three. This list is only limited by my experience. The point is, if you are working for a good company, you get to do a lot of stuff a startup wouldn't even dream of.",1320613110
3203815,comment,3202565,3203176,2,0,Mz,,,"It's not any one thing I did. Nearly 11 years ago, I spent 3.5 months mostly bedridden and then was diagnosed with ""atypical cystic fibrosis"".  During the course of my long decline, I had lost a number of teeth and was left with nerve damage to one side of my face. I also had a fall while very ill and was left with a numb spot on the top  of my foot (and other foot issues).  My main focus was on a) killing infection and b) reversing the pathology of my genetic disorder.  As a side effect, the numb spot went away and I have partially regained some of the lost control over my left cheek.<p>My experience has been that removing enough environmental stressors (like toxic household cleaners), killing infection, and providing sufficient nutritional support will allow the body to heal, even when one has been very severely damaged.  As best I can tell, some of the key nutritional supports for healing my nerves were glyconutrients, Celtic sea salt, and the right oils.  I became fairly fanatical about avoiding oils I did not tolerate well and consuming adequate quantities of oils I did tolerate well, which for me included organic butter and organic coconut oil.  I find that peanut oil does incredibly evil things to my body. There are a few others I try to avoid at all times and there are a number of oils that I tolerate okay, occasionally, in small quantities.  As I heal, my tolerances for things change.<p>I took things to real extremes for a time.  I did a great deal of research and addressed a long list of nutritional deficiencies that I identified symptomatically.  Then I researched which chemical form of various supplements were the optimal ones to take, based on a variety of factors including personal allergies.  I did all this by trial and error, with support from internet groups and internet friends while essentially spurned by my doctors.  I don't see any reason this model couldn't be improved upon with appropriate research and support.<p>Edit:  I will add that I also took high doses of b-vitamins, carnitine to absorb one of them, got off the advil that was depleting the b-vitamins, and at times ate high cholesterol meals, like bacon and eggs with butter on flat bread.  These were also important.  I just didn't pay as much attention to the process of healing my nerves because it wasn't a specific goal.  The nerve damage I had was minor whereas CF is very deadly and I was extremely ill for quite a long time.",1320613091

3203808,comment,3202828,3203198,11,0,asolove,,,"I was interested until this:<p>> ""Five years ago when jQuery was created, just about every web developer knew JS quite well and understood the quirks of every browser and JS implementation.""<p>False. Five years ago programs thought of JavaScript as a silly little non-language to add fantastic effects onto their serious back-end code. When Rails 0.6 added a way to do sort-in-place lists via ajax, and they worked every time, I remember feeling that this was surely some kind of dark magic, because who could write JavaScript that worked all the time with different back-ends?<p>What has actually happened is that the pool of people who used JavaScript five years ago, with in most cases an appropriate dash of fear, are now quite competent JavaScript programmers who can do fancy things. And newer programmers can get started with jQuery even without knowing browser quirks from the start, though eventually they have to learn them.<p>jQuery has lowered the barrier to entry, it hasn't made people stupider. It's made the prior intermediate-level js programmers into ninjas, and it's given newbies the power to do cool things and then complain when they find small problems.<p>CoffeeScript is the same. It lowers the barrier to entry for people who don't care to understand why the arguments array isn't a real array, or how functions definitions are hoisted if they don't come as part of a var statement.<p>Yes, this means that new users will complain because they don't understand the technologies underneath. And that's a challenge to us to be a welcoming and educational community that helps them learn.",1320612941
3203807,comment,3202816,3203663,4,0,m104,,,"NoSQL has never meant ""unreliable datastore for unimportant, throwaway data"". If it did, there would be no need for the MongoDB rant because that poor level of at-scale reliability would have been understood from the beginning. MongoDB wasn't marketed as an unreliable data store, so expectations weren't met by the rant author.<p>I'm worried about the culture that's brewing as well, but I see it more as an attempt from some NoSQL supporters to keep MongoDB looking good, even in the face of serious data integrity issues. The battle lines are forming between SQL and NoSQL (relational vs. non-relational data stores, really) and there's a lot of money and reputation at stake. What we don't want is for the facts to die in a war of rhetoric about the merits of SQL vs. NoSQL. That would be dumb.<p>With that said, the first paragraph of the rant is worrying:<p>""I've kept quiet for awhile for various political reasons, but I now
feel a kind of social responsibility to deter people from banking
their business on MongoDB.""<p>What the hell does ""various political reasons"" mean? I'm more concerned about that than any deficiencies in MongoDB's codebase. Is there a well-funded campaign to silence MongoDB/NoSQL criticism, or is this just one customer's attempt to save face for choosing the wrong data store?",1320612940

Negotiations are two-sided.<p>If, for your $5,000 pay bump, the company decides they'd like you to be closing 35% more bugs than every other employer in your pay band, they can demand that in the negotiation. You can then make a decision about whether or not the bump is worth the concession. If it isn't, you can decline the job, or you can negotiate the concession, or you can decide to accept the previous offer.<p>It is (word chosen carefully:) <i>alarming</i> how bad engineers are at negotiation. Beliefs like yours (aggressive negotiation entitles an employer to maltreat employees later on down the line) are <i>alarmingly</i> common. They're simply not true.<p>The detail-shackled brains of nerds seem unable to get past something here: no matter what employers say the feel about negotiations, surely they can register the tenor of the negotiation in the back of their heads, and then ratchet their expectations appropriately. Surely, nerd engineers think, that must occasionally happen. Answer: yes, it does happen. <i>AT BAD EMPLOYERS</i>. Good employers understand how salary negotiations work and allow for it. The best employers even account for how bad engineers are at negotiations and go out of their way to help educate candidates (Fog Creek, for instance, once said they often ""top up"" the best offers some candidates receive --- that should function as a big red flashing light to those people that they didn't negotiate well enough).<p>I am not telling you that employers won't do irrational things if you negotiate hard with them. I'm telling you that if they do, you should run run run away fast, because that's the canary in the coalmine. Those employers are also going to dilute the shit out of you, call you in to work on weekdays, swap your tolerable manager out with some douchebag they hire from a BigCo to increase productivity, lock you into a regimented COLA-based incentive comp plan, slash your health care benefits 8 months down the road, and never <i>ever</i> improve the hardware you're issued.<p>Don't believe me? Think of it this way: the best engineers are disproportionately <i>likely</i> to negotiate aggressively. Employers that get vindictive about negotiation don't get to hire those people. Why are you interested in working at an employer that shuns the best talent?<p>(Hiring manager, one of many at my company, speaking here.)<p>There. You got a prolix response from me. Happy? :)<p> (about which Patrick is right: its a rounding error, and it's the kind of rounding error that --- unlike, say, a better- but- out- of- spec laptop, which might incur a huge companywide ""new laptops for everyone"" shitstorm --- is particularly easy to concede to a new hire.)<p> (see my about:)",1320612543

This is certainly a great thing to do, but there are other paths to self-employment.  And self employment isn't for everyone.<p>Take me, for example: I'm a developer, and I've been an independent Web/database consultant for 16 years now.  I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to have my job.  I work with half a dozen different companies and organizations each week, I meet new people and businesses all of the time, I get to learn and work with a variety of technologies, I work as a senior technical person rather than as a manager (which would be expected at most companies), and I have a fair amount of control over when and how I work -- although with three kids, a mortgage, and a bunch of clients, I definitely work more hours than I would if I were an employee somewhere.  (But I really enjoy what I do, so that's OK.)  I don't have to ask anyone for permission to go on vacation, to go to a conference, or just to pick up my kids from school once per week.<p>That said, I remember when the current recession started, and high-tech companies were laying people off in droves.  I told my accountant that I was worried about a large crop of these laid-off workers starting to compete with me.  He told me that I shouldn't worry, that most people want to just have a steady paycheck, and don't want to deal with all of the things that a small business owner needs to worry about.<p>And indeed, being in business for yourself means dealing with the month-to-month worries of ensuring you have enough income, that you're marketing yourself in the right ways (and yes, I market myself, although it might not be obvious at first glance), that you know how to choose clients, that you can negotiate with clients and banks, and that you can balance the various demands that your clients put on your time.  It's definitely not for everyone; my wife has gotten used to the ups and downs of our income (and we live pretty well overall), but it's not nearly as straightforward or relaxed as having a paycheck come in every month.<p>If you can pull it off, though, then being self-employed (whether in a startup or a business like mine) is incredibly rewarding and exciting.  I've been offered full-time jobs by a number of companies, and while I've always said, ""I'm willing to consider anything,"" the fact is that I'm really enjoying myself now, and can't imagine returning to the days when I went to the same office, with the same people, and the same tasks day after day.",1320611535

Why the hell is that?<p>NoSQL for me doesn't imply anything other than ""no SQL"", and at a stretch ""no schema"" - this makes a lot of sense for many of us who routinely need to create databases that are logically trivial. In many cases they are a bunch of glorified persistent hash tables that usually don't fit in memory. But this doesn't mean they aren't critical. Why would it have to? This isn't anything new either, we've had Berkeley DB for a long while. It's just a bit of the dry side and it may fall short in many cases.<p>What I was looking forward to and I hoped I could find in the ""NoSQL scene"" is an alternative to traditional DBs but without the overhead that many times is not necessary (but sometimes is, and I intend to continue using PostgreSQL when appropriate). Ideally, something as simple as mongoDB appears to be (tried the interactive tutorial).<p>So when exactly NoSQL stopped meaning ""no SQL"" and started meaning ""unreliable cache""?

Very simple, because the product appears to be severely overhyped and underdelivered.<p>Your primary datastore is not something you want to be taking risks with. If you are looking for a toy you can use any DB you like, including Mongo. If reliability is important to you why would you want to serve as a guinea pig for some seriously buggy product?<p>NoSQL has its place where you have a very specific use case to be solved, but your primary datastore of record is rarely one of those. Mongo specifically is being positioned as a general-purpose datastore and because of that (for me at least) it fails to demonstrate any value whatsoever. Every time I ask any Mongo advocate for why it is a good choice the most compelling thing I hear is ""schema-less DB"" and ""speed of development"". Guess what, maybe if your database forces you to think about your schema, data layout and the query load you are going to have to develop a more reliable application. Having to think through your schemas in advance actually forces you to be disciplined and prevents you from making errors.<p>Once you are ready to confront the reliability issues SQL databases that had years of hardening against all sorts of risks look like a safe harbor. MySQL is not too bad for Facebook and Quora, what prevents you from properly tuning it to work for you?",1320610013

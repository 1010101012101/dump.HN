I'm halfway colorblind, so all your well-tuned colorschemes are for naught.  A friend made me a (presumably really nice) multicolored pastel logo for prgmr.com.   I thought looked like a yellow circle.   Apparently, it had four different colors.<p>But yeah;  I mean, I've seen a lot of really bad websites that have obviously had a lot of effort put into making them pretty.  Remember the 'click here to enter' intro screens?  or flash-based websites?    One certainly can be pretty without being usable.",1269838681

Apple is pure evil just imagine they had the core of their operating system(Darwin) open sourced even if they didn't need it to. They contribute to some high profile open source projects(WebKit, LLVM & SproutCore). Their web browser is standards compliant and their competitors can use the same rendering engine.

1225834,comment,1225440,1225771,0,0,peterarmstrong,,,"As Scott points out, some great novels have been published in serial form.  We're not claiming that this has to be the rule though.<p>However, there's another interesting question: how many good or great novels are sitting half-written on hard drives right now as Word documents, with a discouraged author about to give up on them?<p>If those novels were published as they were written (with automatic distribution of updates and a community of a few passionate readers / fans), maybe some novels worth reading will get created that otherwise might not be...<p>That said, the obvious market for the Lean Publishing approach is, of course, technical books.  Scott and I have both written computer books, so we're very much scratching our own itch here.  Another great market for using Lean Publishing principles is cookbooks, we feel.  Lots of people are blogging and even tweeting cookbooks (although I want more than a 140 character recipe!), and this is definitely something that could be published using a Lean Publishing approach.<p>Neither of us have any idea if it will work for fiction :)<p>Obligatory plug: we welcome computer books, cookbooks and even novels on Leanpub :)",1269838520

1225829,comment,1225785,1225785,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Sun  was embracing Open Source to some degree - though they were always a little schizophrenic on that policy, and never really held to a clear position for about 3-5 years in the middle - but the last few years they seemed to ""get it"".  While this is a minor change (it doesn't appear to affect OpenSolaris) it does seem to be indicative of Oracle taking a few (small) steps away from that position.<p>But, on the flip side (and I say this as someone who learned Unix on SunOS 2.6 in 1998 - I still type ps -ef, and as a Joyent user, though tcsh has given way to bash in my finger memory) - Solaris really is an edge operating system for the masses, somewhat more akin to AIX.  Pretty much the common (server) OS for the masses is Linux, with Open/Free/NetBSD making up the majority of those not going  with Windows.<p>The only people I know using Solaris these days (and this is just an anecdote, so be gentle :-) are people running Oracle or other environments that need to be enterprise robust on vertically scaled system, people using sparc gear, or people who have a legacy investment in Solaris.  This is sad - as few as five years ago, Solaris was still a popular choice for new companies - the OS was just so rock solid stable.<p>I'd love to hear a YC survey on OS choices for server backends - my bet is 50%+ on Linux/BSD, less than 10% Solaris.<p>I'm wondering what percentage of the remaining 40% is Windows, and if AIX ever gets a vote.  I'm presuming HPUX is not chosen for new companies any more, and I fervently pray that everyone steers clear of SCO.",1269838316

Flex 4 (traditional publisher approach).  And we even did release Hello! Flex 4 while it was being written, but I didn't build the community of ""earlyvangelists"" around it that happened with Flexible Rails.  Part of this was the content (Hello! Flex 4 is an uncontroversial introductory book; Flexible Rails was arguing something and was something largely new), but part of it was affected by the dynamic of self-publishing vs. using a traditional publisher.<p>With Flexible Rails I created a Google Group that had hundreds of readers, while the book was still in-progress.  I felt I had a closer connection with them, and I learned what worked and what didn't work in my book, etc.  So that post was about those experiences.<p>Finally, a disclaimer: I'm not an artist, and certainly not a Dostoyevsky, so I really have no idea what kind of feedback that type of talent wants.<p>(P.S. I love Dostoyevsky btw; I read Notes from Underground and The Brothers Karamazov while working a summer job in university at Walmart -- before I switched from Philosophy to Comp Sci.)",1269838047

Winners generally want to continue being winners, so they end up in control of coercive force (guns, military, etc.) and they end up with the tools of propaganda at their disposal (newspapers, puppet officials).<p>What differentiates one nation's winners from those of another is far less than we tend to think, since much of our ""consent"" to the status quo is built upon our belief in certain doctrines and institutions.<p>Surely our democracy is worth something, and many of our institutions are worthy of some deference and respect, but so are China's and Mexico's and Iran's...<p>There are a variety of other fallacies which add to our distorted view of the rest of the world, which I could also go into detail about.",1269837883

They're doing it because fighting you over your idea that you're in love with isn't worth it to them. First example he gives, where Manager Bob is getting ignored -- what if the executive simply doesn't need or respect Bob's opinion? He doesn't need to prove to every non-exec that he thinks his idea is good. Unfortunate, but a fact of life in a hierarchical organization.<p>I like to think of myself as direct and honest, but the overwhelming social norm (at least from what I've seen, on the East Coast of the US) is to pick your battles. If you push back on everything you disagree with, you surprise people and quickly pick up a reputation as argumentative. This is especially true if you engage on issues outside your area of expertise. Programmers telling accounting how to fund benefits? HR telling programmers which hours are ""proper"" to work? Organizational grunts telling execs which markets to expand into? Even if the outsider is right, it's not worth the time of the expert to fight it, and they'll smile, nod, and hope you go away quickly so they can continue being productive.<p>By all means, you should stand up and call out the obvious bullshit, but the world is not black and white.",1269837829

As you say, we think it's a slam dunk for non-fiction books (both Peter and I have written non-fiction books, so we have a bit of experience here).<p>For fiction, I think it's a really interesting and open question.  Dickens, for example, wrote all of his books in serialized format and wrote them a chunk at a time, publishing them as he wrote them (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens</a>).  This was an unusual way to write serialized novels, but Dickens was no slouch and he (in my opinion) stands the test of time.<p>Did he receive and welcome feedback as he wrote?  I don't know the answer to that (I'm a coder and physicist, not an English Lit major :), but I can imagine that he got feedback whether he welcomed it or not.<p>My guess is that for certain types of fiction, and certain types of authors, Leanpub will work really well.  Others will run screaming from the very thought of it.  Hopefully Leanpub will help us find out more.",1269835517

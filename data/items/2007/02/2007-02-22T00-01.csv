431,comment,423,423,0,0,zekepictures,,,"OK, this is my first post. I had already read this elsewhere earlier today, but funny that it's the first thing I've read after joining! I have been doing Avid tech support for over 10 years (Avid is the industry standard software for editing video/film - although that is being threatened strongly) I have been waiting for this to happen. Was wondering when someone would jump on the idea of providing in-browser editing tools for the &#34;YouTube&#34; crowd. Avid's a fool not to embrace this... Anyway, I want to jump in soon with the whole video on the web experience. I hope to update everyone soon over time on what my ideas are... Hope all are well and good luck!",1172105665

The first set indicates: Yes, I agree, or No, I don't agree.

The second set is only ONE arrow, pointing down. This means, &#34;This comment is spam/offensive/offtopic.&#34;",1172103877

How about RSS feeds for individual users comments? Who likes checking into 'roach motels'? I don't. The number of sites I've added content  /., use.perl, perlmonks, reddit only a few allow you to extract *your* insight.

'...  RSS feeds are low-priority. ...'

possibly true, but why should you have to go back to a site/page when you can just grab the data & use it as you like?",1172103568

Possibly both.<p>The best advice I ever got about picking friends was that you should hang out with the people you want to be like.  In your case, you seem to not want to go directly from a strip club to a social establishment and get crunked.  Well, there is a fairly simple solution to that...<p>(UrbanDictionary tells me my usage of ""crunked"" is wrong.

(As opposed to web 1.99a like Slashdot.)<p>Have a choice of pre-defined tags (about 10), each with a karma score attached to them.  These tags would be long the lines of: ""Funny"" ""Interesting"" ""Insightful"" ""Logical Fallacy"" ""Troll""  Users could choose to either moderate a comment, which would be attaching 1 or 2 tags to a comment and thus altering the comment's visibility rating either-or meta-moderating, which would be voting on the fairness of moderation.  So you could see what tags are attached to a comment and vote fair/unfair on each of them.<p>Now here's the rub: you get Karma by fairly moderating.  (And lose it by unfairly moderating.)

613491,story,,,73,111,ilitirit,"Ask HN:  ""Dumbing yourself down"" around your peers?",,"To what extent do you do this and why?  How has it affected you, and your relationships with people?<p>I've been doing it my whole life (I'm 30) because I felt that it would be easier to fit in with most people.  So when I hear people confidently repeat urban myths like ""we only use 10% of our brains"", or ""you'll drown if you don't eat an hour before swimming"" etc, I don't bother trying to explain why I think they're wrong.  Some people take it too personally (because of their ego, perhaps), and if they think you do it too often they tend to avoid your company for various reasons.  Then there are times I avoid discussion of a topic completely because it tends to happen at a very superficial level or from a very narrow perspective (maybe because of things like lack of understanding or confirmation bias).  I find that when I try to expand on certain areas of discussion I just get blank stares.  So I usually just stick to topics like gossip, sport, women, cars, or I let other people do most of the talking.  Obviously all individuals (and my relationships with them) are different to a degree, but these are some of the things I tend to see and do.<p>Anyway, I'm 30 now and I think ""dumbing myself down"" (at least on an intellectual level) has really taken it's toll on me.  I never really had a big problem with managing relationships with people but it's getting to the point where I find conversations with my friends unbearable.  eg.  Last night I was on my phone reading HN and reddit while a group of us were in a lounge at some club (we had just come from a strip-club).  I've vented occasionally about how I felt about this to my mom and she always says I should get new friends.  The problem is that part of trying to fit in is emulating the behaviour of your peers.  When I was younger, I was hung out with the street-thug type (avoided crime and drugs though).  Then I left that for the clubbing and partying scene (took me a while to adjust).  After leaving college I found there are very few people with my interests and lifestyle.  They usually tend to fall into one group or the other.  To put it simply, the one group is smart but boring, the other group is exciting but being around them is a mind-numbing experience.  I've tried having two sets of friends but it didn't work out that well.  I could also try changing my social circles again but where to next?  And I don't really feel like changing my lifestyle again.  Perhaps balance is the key, but finding people with the right balance is not that easy.<p>In the meantime I've resorted back to my (unhealthy) hacker nature.  Dark bedroom, bright monitor, and 20 tabs open in a browser.<p>Anyone else going/been through something similar?  How do you cope/are you coping?",1242573820

The relative value of a letter written by Leonardo Da Vinci and a used life preserver change in the middle of a flood.  One can see this as intrinsic value asserting itself over perceived value.

It's good in bread.<p>I'm not expecting you people looking for quick, healthy food to eat while working on your startup to take the time to make your own cheese, but I love to cook. Paneer doesn't take long, at least: ( <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Paneer-%28Indian-Cheese%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Paneer-%28Indian-Cheese%29</a> )<p>Making your own bread isn't too time-intensive, though. It's just a few short steps over the day, and working dough with your hands after spending hours up in your mind can be a very grounding break.",1242573208

He claims that in the mountainous, llama-ridden regions where wheels are largely useless, the people had already invented wheels. But they used them as toys for children.<p>In the lowlands less than 100 miles away, ideal terrain for wheeled conveyances, they had no llamas. They also had wheels, albeit tiny wheels attached to toys.<p>It wasn't that they were astonishingly stupid to not understand the wheel- they had wheels, for their toys. It was, instead, that they had no other use for it.",1242573042

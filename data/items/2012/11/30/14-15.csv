4853445,comment,4847468,4853075,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">At this point there is no need to raid the ISP because the traffic can be traced back farther than the ISP to a more specific place.<p>It seems like you're <i>still</i> not distinguishing it from the exit node: In order to set up a wiretap, the ISP is going to know about it (it's their equipment). If the ISP employees are the criminals then getting a wiretap for the customer's IP address that they've been spoofing is going to tip them off. If you're not worried about that for the ISP then stop worrying about it for the exit node -- in which case you could do the same thing, require the exit node operator to install wiretapping software on the exit node and trace the traffic ""back farther than the [exit node] to a more specific place"" (i.e. the next Tor node in the chain). It still doesn't get you anything, but neither does a subpoena to the ISP that just leads you to an otherwise-clean exit node.<p>>Obviously running a TOR exit node, open wifi or ISP can't be a blank check to get away with crime.<p>People keep saying this -- it's wrong twice. First, just because you can't do a smash and grab police raid doesn't mean you can't do an investigation. Digital forensics are crap anyway -- way too easy to forge. (Criminal installs remote control software on some poor sap's PC to do dirty work, secure removes it when finished and everything ends up pointing to the sap.) Try doing some actual police work, interview suspects, look at the illicit materials to see if there are clues from the background, on and on. And after you've done your homework, if the evidence still points to the exit node operator (instead of just the exit node's IP address), then you do a raid.<p>But perhaps more importantly, how is it the <i>operators</i> of the anonymizing thing who we are worried about getting away with something? If you know enough about Tor to set up an exit node and you're a criminal, you can just use somebody else's exit node instead of setting up your own. Or hop on some public wifi, or break into some sucker's PC to use it as a proxy, etc. If the police have successful methods to catch <i>those</i> criminals, then use them against the criminal who hides under an exit node instead of raiding it.<p>And if not, well, that's life. A police state is very helpful to the police. The cost of not having a police state is that some criminals get away with it. It's the cost of doing business in a free society.<p>>That's obviously wrong, but it happens all the time, often totally benignly, in this case much more maliciously.<p>Which is why they ought to be stopped. Government malfeasance is all but universally a more serious problem than private malfeasance, because a good government can often save you from bad private actors, but almost nobody can save you from a bad government.",1354287256
4853444,comment,4847468,4852190,1,0,baak,,,"You downplayed child pornography as just someone ""jerking off to a picture."" So yes, you apparently don't see the other consequences of it, and don't think it's a big deal. That's what you don't seem to understand: It's not the 'transfer of data'. Abuse of children might still happen, but this promotes it. You're creating a 'market' for it, where as before it might not have existed.<p>Now, would I get rid of the internet if it meant getting rid of Child Pornography? Obviously not. I wouldn't get rid of handguns if it meant attempting to stop murder in the United States as well.<p>Here's the issue with your outlook: You act as though it is one or the other. You must take down the internet entirely or you must allow all child pornography to flow freely through your computer. Your outlook on the law isn't balanced at all. You won't give up any civil liberties because you feel you shouldn't compromise on it.",1354287255

There are clear use cases for either Drupal or Rails.  I understand why you yearn for a Ruby Drupal, because dealing with PHP is a hassle, but objectively there is little to be gained since Drupal is already a beast and performance would only be hurt by being ported to Ruby.<p>Aside from that, the key advantage that Rails or other low-level web frameworks have over Drupal is that they don't make any assumptions beyond the fact that you are using HTTP.  With Drupal there is an incredible amount of pre-existing architectural cruft to enable its powerful functionality, but it creates a ton of overhead to deal with as soon as you want to do something that doesn't neatly fit it's paradigm.  As soon as you brought something like this into Rails then you'd be defeating the purpose of its simple elegance.<p>I just don't see any way to separate out the best of both worlds.

Rather it's the technical culture of moving fast and breaking things.  With Rails you need to stay on top of upgrades all the time.  If you are actively working on an app then this is a net benefit because you get new features.  But it also creates maintenance work downstream, and not just with application code, but application servers are also relatively unstable.  When you have something with a high heterogenous installation count like WordPress or other popular open-source apps, the pain of maintaining version compatibility and keeping it running over time far dwarfs any benefit of using a more powerful language like Ruby.",1354285277

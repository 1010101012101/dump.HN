My Windows knowledge is now rather out of date, and getting more so over the years. It isn't worth my time anymore to keep up with each increasingly baroque change to the Windows environment. Just as an example, over this time the latest ""hot"" communication paradigm that Microsoft recommended developers use in Windows changed from NetBEUI, to NetDDE, then OLE, followed by OLE2, then COM, DCE/RPC, DCOM, and now currently seems to be Web Services (SOAP and the like). Meanwhile, in the UNIX world the Berkeley socket API was useful in the 1980's and is still the core of all communications frameworks in the open standards world. All the UNIX RPC, object and Web Service environments are built on that stable base.</i>",1321361948

Situations where people trade away their strengths by trying to mimic what's glamourous.<p>Here's one - look at the way that OS desktops compromise strengths in order to be more like OSX. Microsoft was so focussed on making Windows feel more like aqua that they compromised things where they were strong - like the way you could get around with hotkeys, or set up items in the old start menu to be launched by two keypresses. The gnome team had what was to me the best desktop environment out there and have traded it away in their quest to be the poor-man's Aqua. (Give me window switching - I hate application swiching. In what situation would I want all of my terminals to come to the foreground in front of the web browser I'm copying commands from??)",1321360820

The two libraries are not compatible in terms of either file format or API, and there are no plans to establish such compatibility.<p>Does Lucy provide a search server like Solr?<p>Lucy is a low-level library, like Lucene. We'd like to provide a search server eventually, but it will likely be a thin wrapper rather than a comprehensive application like Solr. The low-level capabilities are our core mission.<p>Why don't you use Swig?<p>A major design goal of Lucy is to present bindings which are as idiomatic as possible so that our users feel as though they are programming in their native language and not in C. Swig is a great tool, but it does not offer support for many of the features which make Lucy so user friendly: subclassing, named parameters, default argument values, etc.<p>From <a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/lucy/MinimizingObjectOverhead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/lucy/MinimizingObjectOverhead</a><p>Lucy must be designed so that native OO overhead is minimized.<p><pre><code>    Algorithms which create and destroy as few native objects as possible are preferred.\n    Native method calls should be avoided for high-volume, performance critical applications. Possible alternatives:\n        Change the algo to use a for/while loop (either native or C).\n        Use a C struct with a function pointer.\n        Use a C function.</code></pre>",1321360530

Somehow I can't help but think that people up there are missing something when they keep throwing money at compressing a number resulting from statistically ineluctable collisions of numerous moving objects (whose seriousness and frequency drops could just as well be explained by combined and massive improvements made to car safety, making the policy look like even more futile), while a little education of people would actually help some of us recognize early and/or late signs of depression <i>on third parties</i>, allowing for professional help to be reached soon enough.

It's not locked in at birth. It can be trained, and it can also wither on the vine if not properly used and challenged. And it's highly susceptible to environment: types of attention received as a child, education, socialization, and even environmental pollutants all play a big role.

One backend that throws out JSON/XML or whatever and a frontend in HTML/Javascript.<p>I actually find that bit easier, because I can separate out the the parts and worry about things a piece at a time. The other benefit of this is if you chose to develop for iOS, Android or any other platforms you already have an API. Equally if you wanted a developer program, again it's already there.<p>The complexity comes when you make the decision as to whether or not to support clients that can't or won't execute Javascript, if you want to make it work for them too you're stuck with more work and things do get more difficult.<p>As far as testing goes, there are plenty of mature javascript unit testing frameworks and if your inclined to unit test your javascript already this doesn't add a great deal of overhead.

Current earnings are not a worse predictor of future earnings than many other more complex possible models.  Under the assumption that future earnings will be at least reasonably predicted by current earnings, comparing the price as a multiple to that predictor is not a bad way to make a purchase decision relative to other assets.  Of course book value is important, as are growth prospects, but book value (hopefully less so after IFRS4) is not really a great estimator of fire-sale value, and I would argue that growth is second order to earnings' first order and accordingly harder to estimate.",1321359268

The problem described is a liquidity problem much more than a debt problem. We could in theory imagine the villagers to trust each other enough to trade the IOUs between each other and solve the problem without the rich german. For example if A owes 100 to B who owes 100 to C who owes 100 to A, then A could give C's IOU to B and have his debt cleared B would then give C's IOU to C in exchange of his own bieng returned. No more debt and no germans involved. However this assumes that B trusts C enough to accept his IOU as payement from A.<p>If we were to use the analogy In the case of Grece, the hotel owner would owe a few thousand euros to different pawnbrokers in nearby villages, rush to pay them, and the german is in for a nasty surprise after he's done inspecting the rooms.

To a large extent, this is probably a similar problem non-tech people face when looking for tech co-founders - the ones who are most likely to be capable are probably already <i>doing</i> something.<p>I meet a fair number of people who might be non-tech co-founders - they tick some of the boxes.  But when discussing things more, then almost inevitably fall short of my own expectations.<p>This is hard to put in to words, but the ones I've talked to seem more in love with the idea of being in a startup than actually <i>working</i> on one.  There's also seemingly little drive to do much more than talk.  Generally, also, there's little financial stability in their lives, to be able to deal with no or limited income for several months while ramping up.  And based on discussions with some potential co-founders over the past several years, there seems to be little willingness to be at all flexible with their own ideas - they have tended to think of themselves as Steve Jobs, and me more as a Wozniak to be used and thrown out later.<p>So... again, while I'm open to the idea, I'm not actively looking.

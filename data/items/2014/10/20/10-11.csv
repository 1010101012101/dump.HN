There is no anti-drone party, no anti-NSA party, and no anti-Drug-War party: the two dominant parties agree more than they differ, especially when looking at actions rather than rhetoric. Moreover, huge numbers of people are completely disenfranchised if they support the minority party in the wrong district or state.<p>Our democracy isn&#x27;t completely ineffectual; some good people sneak through now and then, and there is <i>some</i> counter-balance to blatant abuses of power. But it&#x27;s a far cry from government by/of/for the people.<p>(Incidentally: it&#x27;s worth nothing that the Constitution repeatedly refers to &quot;person&quot; and not &quot;citizen&quot;.

The market, however, does often favor concentration of power, and when that happens, democracies should protect themselves.<p>The US in particular has had a history of businesses gaining too much power and seriously hurting the public. This is Krugman&#x27;s main point:<p><i>[Y]es, I have Amazon Prime and use it a lot. But again, so what? The desirability of new technology, or even Amazon’s effective use of that technology, is not the issue. After all, John D. Rockefeller and his associates were pretty good at the oil business, too — but Standard Oil nonetheless had too much power, and public action to curb that power was essential... The robber baron era ended when we as a nation decided that some business tactics were out of line. And the question is whether we want to go back on that decision.</i><p>Personally I think that exploitative practices by big business are making a huge comeback, in Silicon Valley in particular (see Google with privacy, Uber with workers, the SV non-poaching cartel and more). It is interesting to compare and contrast this with the Gilded Age robber barons. It&#x27;s certainly not the same, but the robber barons are coming back, albeit in a new form.",1413802674

It&#x27;s very rare to need interface{} in your own code.  Some very specialized packages (like JSON) need it, and yes, sometimes helper functions for testing need it.

It is entirely possible many of these &#x27;correct programs&#x27; are not useful at all, or arguably useful, or are outside the domain criteria, and rejecting them is fine. This is often a leading motivator behind the design of things like domain specific languages, or designs like MISRA C - many things <i>by design</i> cannot be done, but often those aren&#x27;t the things we care about, use, or wish to discuss anyway.<p>On the flip side, there are things type systems enable that I do not think can be actually accomplished in an untyped language - but really, this isn&#x27;t very interesting aside from being a minor technical factoid, IMO. It&#x27;s very far removed from the more interesting question of whether or not it&#x27;s useful to consider these things at all.

8481427,comment,8481011,8481336,0,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"The textbook answer to why monopsony is unhealthy is monopsony suppresses investment in production. In this case, the risk is dissuading authors from writing by suppressing their earnings.<p>Imagine a simplified supply chain: authors distribute through Amazon to reach readers. Amazon exerting pricing pressure on authors benefits readers in the short term by reducing their reading costs. But by reducing authors&#x27; profits, Amazon dissuades new entry. Authors with skills elsewhere write less; the diversity and quality of new books suffers. Monopsony, when it reduces producer profits below equilibrium (e.g. what these authors would earn with many Amazons fighting for their business), dissuades investment in production.<p>Reality is complicated by the middleman, publishers. Now we have authors contracting with publishers to distribute through Amazon to reach readers. There are multiple publishers competing for authors, so for now the authors don&#x27;t appear to be squeezed as much as the middleman. Authors&#x27; continued use of publishers hints at the value of their services, which may be nothing more than collective bargaining.<p>Removing legacy middlemen is healthy. Skewing producers&#x27; bargaining rights is not. Disentangling publishers&#x27; rents (the fraction of publishers&#x27; profits which come from them being, before Amazon, authors&#x27; only choice for distribution) from authors&#x27; costs of production (what good authors need to be paid to compensate them for the time, skill and risk which goes into writing) is difficult.",1413800944

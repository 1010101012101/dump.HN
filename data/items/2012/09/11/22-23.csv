4508212,story,,,2,9,FireBeyond,"Ask HN: Python / Django Workflow, and choosing an OS",,"I'm trying to transition my work world from one of PHP and possibly the world's ugliest Zend Framework code (which is not necessarily a dig at ZF, but horrific development practices, reactive testing, and 'debug in production') to something a lot more organized and streamlined, with Python and Django (both of which I'm fairly new at, though experienced as a web developer, albeit PHP).<p>I would like to get some input. Try as I may, my mind just doesn't sit well with OS X - I keep trying it, and find my brain likes 'structure and discipline' and feels chaotic with windows at ""random"" locations all over my desktop. I like the Unix/BSD underbelly, but still. Maybe there are methodologies that can help?<p>I'm really debating whether to go back to Windows, or retry Ubuntu. What holds me back from Ubuntu is the Office suite (I know the arguments), and GoToMeeting (absolutely mandatory at this point - I telecommute, and it's our annointed method of desktop sharing).<p>But what I'm really trying to iron out is a workflow for developing, testing, deployment. I'd like to get something set up with tools like LXC for virtualizing a production environment (currently on a separate machine). I'm not really looking for any comments of the lines of ""Why Django?"" - you're solving the wrong problem. Instead, offer me insight on how I can streamline a workflow from conception to delivery and beyond.<p>I currently use PyCharm and Sublime Text 2, and am very happy with these, though I'm not averse to hearing compelling arguments (rather than religious wars) on alternatives (as much as I see, and admire the vim-elite, I'm not sure I can make that me).",1347404323

It doesn't work that way.  You need to test on actual mobile devices from the start, you need to account for the lower CPU performance of them, you need to figure in higher latency over 3G connections vs. wired LANs.<p>You have to do all of this on native apps anyway, but you <i>know</i> you have to do it from the start, otherwise you can't even get your app to display, and the frameworks are built with this in mind.  There're still some areas where HTML5 wins - it's easier to update the app, for one, and it's more familiar to web developers.  But the developer-convenience scales were not shifted as far to the HTML5 side as people hoped they were.<p>I'm still not sure which technology is, on the whole, better for mobile apps.  But one of the signs that you actually understand a problem domain is that you can give advice more specific than just ""Competing technology X is better than competing technology Y"".  We aren't going to get that in a TechCrunch soundbite; there're a lot of specifics that depend upon <i>exactly</i> what your market is.",1347404080

4508190,comment,4505099,4507741,3,0,chipsy,,,"It depends on how you formulate your risk model.<p>The industry titans can afford to develop ""any"" amount of custom tech, subject to schedule constraints, since the art and marketing budgets tend to vastly outweigh the engineering now. But in the last decade, they've tended to shy away from really ambitious tech projects, favoring incremental improvements to a general world-simulation model that applies across all the typical AAA genres. In their risk assessments, they've decided what kind of product and technology is being made early on, so that the bigger expenses aren't in danger. As well, sticking with the same toolset allows it to be further refined.<p>Indies, on the other hand, have a lot to gain by taking on ambitious technology and de-emphasizing the costly assets - and usually, the technology itself isn't risky, so much as it is just an ""unknown engineering challenge"" - something that could be a few days or a few months. Something like Braid or Minecraft can be achieved by experimenting and chipping away at the concept over a few iterations. Minecraft's earliest versions didn't have a lot the ""big features"" that are in the game now.<p>But it's also incredibly scary to take on those projects all alone, so the majority of indies aren't even going to consider it. Indies are looking for ""easy"" too, even if it's bad for them from a business standpoint.<p>I do think that engines like Unity have a lot of value and can even be extended to include some new technology. (I started working on something that builds on Unity's physics system recently - and it shows some promise to be a unique product) But the people who are taking on the unknowns just tend, statistically speaking, to be the people confident enough to write everything themselves too.",1347404014

Facebook would probably be less fun if it cared more about quality.<p>Facebook's product is a website, so it can fix things quickly. It has a process which permits rapid deployment of new code, and rapid rollback of buggy changes. This reduces the cost of recovering from bugs.<p>Facebook's product has a lot of momentum and lock-in. The barrier for users or businesses to move off Facebook is very high. This gives Facebook a wider margin of error to ship glitchy software. If Google was broken for a day, you'd probably go to Bing and might not come back. If your iPhone pissed you off all the time, you'd probably buy an Android when you're faced with the decision in a year or two.

But seriously, saying ""HTML5 failed you"" when you don't even compile your scripts and initial resources to require a minimal amount of requests is just ludicrous.<p>To clarify: I'm not saying that facebook's HTML5 developers can't hold their own -- they produced a great looking mobile app with a truckload of functionality (and believe me, I understand code bloat).

Keeping Zuckerberg in the CEO role for too long.<p>3. Taking their users for granted.<p>Obviously the first has seriously damaged their credibility, and with it their ability to hire and retain people who could solve their problems and grow the business.<p>I believe the second has a similar effect. Aside from the catastrophe of the IPO, Facebook don't appear to be going anywhere strategically. The cat is out of the bag in terms of cost effectiveness (or lack thereof) of Facebook ads compared to alternatives like Google. And generating ad revenue on small-screen mobile is bound to be harder, whether you're using HTML5 or anything else, because the physical screen size only provides so much space.<p>The third will probably be what finally kills them. As long as they can maintain the critical mass of users, the ""everyone's on Facebook because everyone's on Facebook"" effect, they can get away with a lot. But no-one using Facebook goes there for the ads, and no-one really likes all the privacy invasion. These things are merely tolerated, and only up to a point, because people like being sociable and right now Facebook lets them keep in touch with their friends and family more conveniently than anyone else.<p>So when Zuckerberg says ""Over the next three to five years, the biggest question on everyone's mind is really going to be how well Facebook does with mobile""[1], I think perhaps he's getting ahead of himself. The biggest question I would ask, if I were a potential investor, is whether Facebook will still have that critical mass of users in three to five years, or whether, like every popular social forum on the Web before them, they will have been disrupted by the new shiny.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19565937"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19565937</a>",1347401660

4508017,comment,4507879,4507954,2,0,realrocker,,,"But, the Facebook philosophy has always been, of hacking together what works today and think about other things later. HTML5 allows rapid fluid UI(as in feed based UI) development. The native app would have taken atleast 4-6 months for a barely tested app( As an Android Developer, I can vouch for that). They got the HTML5 app running in much less time. Having a lot of resources doesn't mean better quality work. More often than not, small teams are deliberately allotted such tasks to maintain homogeneity in design and code architecture. A mobile app is special type of software where the UI is very close to the other components(i.e Event Handling, Models etc.). Putting a large number of developers on it won't make it go any faster. Think of that scenario: 200 people working on a mobile app, pumping out features and testing sequentially!!How would that even work?",1347401455

They had a great product idea, and good execution, but the business of advertising online really was built around search ads, nearly everything else was remnants. The missing piece was fitting into the existing infrastructure in a way that could fund them until they could pull in advertisers directly.<p>Difference between thinking like an engineer and thinking like a founder.

4507982,comment,4506134,4506802,1,0,larrys,,,"""Donald Trump is a legend in his own mind.""<p>I've been following Trump since before he built Trump Tower. Which opened in 1983.<p>Interestingly the wiki page on Trump Tower says this:<p>""He also renovated the Trump Tower in New York City and several other residential projects.""<p>Of course didn't renovate it. He built it from the ground up, acquiring the land and pushing through the project much to the chagrin of his father (who developed other buildings). Trump learned much from his father (and he also graduated Wharton undergrad). He spent time on job sites and learned the construction business from the ground up. I remember when Trump Tower was built. It was a big achievement for someone his age at the time (and would be now as well).  And it was done in NYC with red tape, unions and all the obstacles that building in NYC brings. This is not like putting up a small structure in the suburbs by any means.<p>While many, including you, might feel Trump is a ""legend in his own mind"" I respectfully disagree having watched him for many years. He's had his failures but he's come back. He's mastered the art of self promotion and I have to tell you he did this at a level nobody had ever seen before at least for real estate development.<p>Incidentally it is known in real estate circles that wealthy people will generally pay more to live in a Trump building than ""brand x"". That's part of the reputation that he has among people with money to burn. It's hard to believe that he is pulling the wool over the eyes of so many people and not providing value to them.<p>Oh, by the way as far as the casinos? Trump suffered a huge loss when he was starting out in NJ in that the man that he hand picked to run his casino business was killed in a helicopter crash prior to (or around) the opening. He was so devastated he named his 6000 seat arena after Mark. He didn't have to do that and it certainly shows the value of that person to the organization and knocked him off balance. I remember the news stories from that time.<p>Add: Mark Etess was the executive.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etess_Arena"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etess_Arena</a>",1347400918

Proof checking is something that computers do well, except that describing a proof to a computer is usually non-trivial.<p>Where proof-checkers -- human and otherwise -- will get hung up, especially with the new maths, is that it may not be obvious how each step follows from the last.<p>What will happen is something a bit interactive: if the proof checker cannot intuitively see the logic in one step of the proof, he may first try to prove the lemma himself.  If he can't, he'll go back to the original author of the proof and say, ""Hey, I don't see how you go from step 518 to step 519.  Can you prove it?""  Sometimes the author easily can; he just didn't elaborate on that step in the proof because it was so obvious to him.  Sometimes he can't; either in trying to prove that lemma he finds a contradiction, in which case the proof is incorrect, or maybe he just can't prove it, and the proof is ... incomplete.<p>It's this last situation which causes these grand proofs to drag out for so many years.  At some point in the 500 pages, there is a jump which the author didn't notice, and it takes him another few years to prove that jump.  The checkers have a much easier job, because they just have to <i>try</i> to follow the logic; if they fail, the burden is on the author to make the point at which they stick more clear.",1347400916

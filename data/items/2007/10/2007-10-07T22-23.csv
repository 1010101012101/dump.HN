64536,story,,,6,26,mrtron,"What is an idea worth?",,"Here is a common situation for starting projects.  One person comes to the table with an idea, and one or more people join them.<p>What is the idea worth?  If there are 3 people, how could you split up things from the beginning?  Is the idea worth anything?<p>On the same note, if someone has some domain knowledge and contacts in the field, how should that play into the first split?<p>I have discussed this with several people, and their opinions have been wildly varied, so let me know your thoughts!",1191797904
64535,comment,63009,64256,0,0,webmaven,,,"Yes, I did say you would probably still move (and still <i>want</i> to move). But not necessarily to SV.<p>If there are 'only' 5-6 startup hubs today, not too long ago there was only one. Since the other  4-5 hubs managed to grow in spite of SV's existence (and dominance), I do expect this number to increase further, by one order of magnitude at least.<p>I don't think the star-system is necessarily a relevant analogy because it is focusing on individuals, who as actors, actually have quite a few more options than just Hollywood. Rather, what would happen if 50% of the next generation of movie producers and production companies were from St. Louis (or Bollywood)? Or, for a different scenario, 50% of the next generation of SFX and post-production companies? Do they all <i>have</i> to move to Hollywood? Can some of them move back? For some types of companies, It's actually demonstrable that they don't all make the move, and a rash of soundstages and post-production facilities are sprouting up in secondary hubs across the US because Hollywood is too expensive and crowded.<p>Your empirical argument is well taken. By no means was I arguing that SV would become irrelevant to the current industry <i>because</i> of growth per-se, but you're assuming that startups are (and will remain) an 'industry', and second, that they will remain the same industry.<p>Personally, I anticipate quite a bit more disruption and creative destruction than that. The US rust-belt is testimony that further growth in an industry can under the right circumstances pass existing hubs by, eventually making them irrelevant because the industry itself has changed in fundamental ways. It is also possible that 'startups' might get distributed into the broader economic fabric as thoroughly as 'web design' or 'desktop publishing'. This may actually be required if companies in all industries (in industry-specific hubs everywhere) are to grow by acquiring startups rather than hiring.",1191797353

64530,comment,64475,64475,0,0,curi,,,"They are proud of a positive trade balance for the EU (of 3 billion, which seems tiny for a 16 trillion GDP). That's silly:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism</a><p><i>David Hume famously noted the impossibility of the mercantilists' goal of a constant positive balance of trade. As bullion flowed into one country, the supply would increase and the value of bullion in that state would steadily decline relative to other goods. Conversely, in the state exporting bullion, its value would slowly rise. Eventually it would no longer be cost-effective to export goods from the high-price country to the low-price country, and the balance of trade would reverse itself. Mercantilists fundamentally misunderstood this, long arguing that an increase in the money supply simply meant that everyone gets richer.[20]</i><p>Countries with trade surplus are <i>giving loans</i> of wealth and capital to other people who are better at actually using stuff. In return for their <i>giving up their stuff</i> they get money, which has only one use: getting some stuff back later. Whereas countries with trade deficits are like new companies that get a loan and go do something useful with it -- they are the ones who are best at using stuff.",1191795771

He's the MINIX guy, and that book is pretty much the de facto standard text on operating systems. It's expensive, so see if you can find an international edition. I picked mine up for the equivalent of USD $10 in India.",1191795710

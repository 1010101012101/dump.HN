The slow burn, 7-figure exit that founders want is almost useless to VCs. The model requires that the winners pay for the losers. The VC has a finite number of at-bats every year, and each one needs to potentially be an out-of-the-park home run. A company that deliberately bunts is costing the VC an opportunity to recoup their losses on failures, which is the majority of their portfolio.<p>Founders like to kid themselves about this, but if they raise from a big institutional VC and plan on sitting on the money or executing on a &quot;safe&quot; 1.5-2x model, they&#x27;re the ones being deceptive.<p>Safe, conservative plans are awesome.

For example, I&#x27;ve submitted reports on thousands (ex-hobby of mine) of spam locksmith listings over the years via Maps RAP and MM Report this.  The MM team would readily remove spam, whereas the Local team wouldn&#x27;t, even though the POIs were clearly spammy (special characters in the name). I&#x27;ve also coordinated with other maps users, and it seems the consensus is is that Local team will protect claimed listings at all costs, even to the point of hiding addresses for spam SABs (service area businesses) when they should just be removed altogether.  If a spam POI is in the middle of a lake, or has weird characters in the name to evade the spam filters, wouldn&#x27;t that raise some alarm bells somewhere?  Do they have any standards or guidelines for evaluating the spammiess of a POI?  Local seems to be engaged in an aggressive turf war with other teams, like Map Maker to protect their listings.  Many edits that I&#x27;ve made to benign POIs within MM have been denied by LEs, only to be later accepted and corrected by GRs.  Can you comment on the differences in quality among the respective teams, and their methods for evaluating edits?  And why are they so determined to keep SABs out of the MM listings, especially considering the many of the SABs are spam, and use virtual offices, PO boxes, and unrelated business addresses (McDonalds, etc.), and, at least in the US, have to be licensed for business (and the business license address itself is a matter of public record?  The reason given was that they wanted to protect the privacy of the business owner, but businesses have virtually no privacy (and no one used MM to find businesses except to edit them).  SABs used to be visible in MM, now they&#x27;re not.  The &quot;new&quot; Maps RAP is terrible at reporting issues beyond just the basics.  Reporting spam with the Maps RAP is a chore and almost better suited to MM.<p>Regarding florists, they&#x27;re bad, completely agree.

8720415,comment,8719900,8720135,0,0,groby_b,,,"Couple of thoughts, unsorted brain dump:<p>* Ranking/Karma systems can and will be abused. See the digg bury brigade, etc. It&#x27;s really difficult to separate honest feedback from feedback deliberately tailored to vanish unpopular opinion, or hurt people. (It&#x27;s not like eBay ratings aren&#x27;t gamed, either. Or Amazon ratings/reviews)<p>* Related to that: One person&#x27;s troll is another person&#x27;s idol. Post on any political topic if you don&#x27;t believe that :)<p>* Related: I believe comment-based rating works slightly better than user-based rating. Just because it takes a lot of effort to silence a user by downvoting every single comment. It still allows burying unpopular opinion<p>* I believe rating systems are gamed because rating is &quot;free&quot;. If you only had limited rating capital to expend, I&#x27;d assume most people would not want to waste it on burying things.<p>* On the flip side, reputation doesn&#x27;t matter to many people because it is assigned to online IDs, not actual people. I.e. reputation is free, as well.<p>* Instead of a narrow AI, I&#x27;m wondering if a simple Bayesian filter might do the trick for the vast majority of Internet trollery. Yes, it&#x27;s gameable, but as troll filters become more sophisticated over time, gaming becomes OK. [3]<p>* An immutable ledger of past reputation transactions might be meaningful. (Yes, I&#x27;m on the Bitcoin bandwagon with that, sorry). It does not solve the issue of multiple accounts with different reputations, but it&#x27;s in each participants interest to have each individual entity represent <i>consistent</i> reputation.<p>* I believe any reputation system will have a social component. What your friends think about somebody you never met matters more than what random strangers think, because chances are your friends and you have at least similar value systems.<p>* Society-level interventions might start with educating people in &quot;direct communication&quot; [1] and &quot;nonviolent communication&quot;[2]. And yes, education in general helps too. I&#x27;m not sure &quot;biological interventions&quot; are without ethical issues.<p>* You <i>do</i> increase the risk of an information bubble - people might confuse civility with agreement. But I do think that over time, that might sort itself out. In my experience, people I consider of high integrity tend to rank other people&#x27;s integrity based on behavior, not opinion or political leaning. I might be an optimist.<p>* It seems I use politeness and trust interchangeable. I&#x27;ll have to ponder that some more, but it seems fundamentally correct to me. I care about respectful politeness, not fake politeness with ensuing backstabbing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://csde.washington.edu/~mbw/direct-and-indirect-communication.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://csde.washington.edu/~mbw/direct-and-indirect-communi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/810/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/810/</a>",1418089004

They were very interested in our technology, and we were both young and naive. Still, we&#x27;ve been warned so often about dealing with large companies that pretty early into the process we insisted on signing a paid Software Eval agreement. In retrospect, it was a pretty small amount of money (five digits), but at the time it felt like a huge win. From the moment they said &quot;we&#x27;d like to try your software&quot;, the procurement department was involved -- NDA, software eval docs, etc.<p>The software eval was &quot;successful&quot; (in fact, we even presented to the CTO, the President, and VP of Engineering of the company), but it wasn&#x27;t truly an eval. It was a very custom-tailored version of our product for their deployment. And yet it still didn&#x27;t really go anywhere. Things fizzled out with them for a while and then about 12 months later they came back once again asking to do another evaluation. This time we insisted on success criteria that required them to commit to a set number of seats if the evaluation was successful. The evaluation was successful, and they bought the seats, but even now the deployment is in a state of &quot;proof of concept&quot; -- they bought ~1,000 seats from us, but at their organization size it&#x27;s just not that material yet. Seriously.<p>Another company we dealt with was a ~15,000 employee company. They too were very interested in our technology. They emailed us and convinced us to come and do a demo in person. Having liked the demo they told us they wanted to pilot the software. This immediately kicked off the conversation with the procurement department. NDA, software eval, success criteria, etc. This time, we did need to do some additional work, but we were very diligent in making sure that _any_ custom work that we do was applicable to all customers. They too have now bought ~1,000 seats, and are now in the process of rolling AeroFS out to the rest of their company, but as a benchmark, it has been ~12 months since they bought their initial 1,000 seat license. In some ways, even for them the 1,000 seat license was a continuation of their PoC.<p>Enterprise sales are slow, but the resulting contracts can be quite lucrative. Just make sure you qualify your customers. It sounds like you only lost ~2 weeks on this deal, and that&#x27;s really not the end of the world :)",1418088864

So it takes a certain percentage of production (GDP) and pays the benefit of that production to people in other countries.  Japan has a much bigger debt problem than the USA in percentage terms.  Nearly all their debt is owed to those in Japan so when it is paid it merely redistributes wealth (rather than losing it to those overseas).<p>While inflation can allow you to payoff debt with less valuable $ and thus reduce the value of what is given to other countries (also to retirees and other holders of government debt but for the matter of losing wealth to other countries that isn&#x27;t a factor).  But markets adjust and unless you have now paid off all your debt and owe nothing you have to borrow again, and lenders will demand larger interest payments to make up for the risk of your debasing the currency to pay them back worthless dollars.  So while this can maybe work in the short term if you fool the markets it most likely doesn&#x27;t work in the long term for the USA.<p>I would say it is probably true defaulting on foreign banks would be preferable but it isn&#x27;t that neat.  The USA would default to everybody and it would be chaos (because of the central role of the USA - different than if some minor economic power defaults).  The USA owes lots to foreigners and those in the USA and while spreading the costs of default overseas sounds better really it would be so catastrophic I doubt it matters.

8720313,comment,8719977,8720121,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Actually, it&#x27;s more like this.<p>There are good programmers in the enterprise (meaning, say, investment banks or large corporations or governments) but they generally fall, ambition-wise, into one of three categories:<p>(1) those who want to become managers or software architects (or, in finance, quants and traders) and will define and oversee work but delegate the dirty bits. This would be fixable (they could oversee a team of mediocrities, who&#x27;d be grateful just to be employed) but they generally don&#x27;t have the patience for that.<p>(2) those who want to do highly-theoretical R&D work that doesn&#x27;t necessarily solve any immediate problems of the business.<p>(3) those who have a specialty (say, deep neural networks) and want to be in the umbrella of a large organization that can protect it. Pull them out of their specialties and they&#x27;ll try to leave.<p>In other words, these supposedly stodgy non-technology companies <i>do</i>, contrary to stereotype, have good programmers (I&#x27;ve worked in a few) but the ones who are at all decent have career strategies that they expect to be able to implement in their full-time work. They won&#x27;t work on &quot;just anything&quot; and if you stick them with the random muck that comes from the line of business or zealous &quot;product people&quot;, they&#x27;ll either leave or slack in order to learn new skills on the clock, and the project will be done poorly or even abandoned mid-flight.<p>The appeal of the $3000-per-day consultant is that he&#x27;ll work on what he&#x27;s told to do and he doesn&#x27;t expect you to consider his career needs. He&#x27;s not going to do a shitty job and leave after 6 months because the people allocating the work don&#x27;t care about his career; that&#x27;s what the money (4-6x typical salary) is for. He gets his education and career advancement on his own time and dime (but earns a premium to account for his unpaid work). And while he might not be a great (2.0+) programmer, he&#x27;s better than anyone in-house who could actually be assigned a bad project without political friction or high departure risk.<p>The average Bay Area startup programmer, like the average software consultant, isn&#x27;t great; but he&#x27;s far better than the corporate serfs who get sloshed around on the worst projects. He might be 1.4-1.5; so Goldman&#x27;s R&D engineers and it top quant-coders will be better, but he&#x27;s a relative colossus compared to the in-house peons (0.7-1.2) in back-office IT who&#x27;d get assigned to grody projects based on internal processes.<p>(Of course, not all the work that consultants do is undesirable. You also have the specialists and those with elite levels of skill. My point is that a &quot;mercenary&quot; consultant will power through the ugly projects for the pot of gold, whereas in-house people expect investment in their careers.)<p>In other words: yes, Goldman can hire great people. But if you want to hire someone great to do a project where 99% of the work is mediocre (and the 1% is extremely careful and requires an expert) you want the $3000/day consultant because Goldman can&#x27;t get anyone good who&#x27;s in-house (and not getting a consulting salary) to do the work. One might ask: why don&#x27;t they pay an internal person $3000 per day, as they would a consultant? The answer is that it&#x27;d have him out-earning his boss and they&#x27;d often end up promoting someone not on traditional definitions of readiness (increasing scope, leadership) but because he took on an icky project.",1418087211

It was meant to replace the B-52 but the B-52 is likely to outlive it.<p>I&#x27;m not really even sure how it is an improvement on the B-52 anyways. The listed payloads on Wikipedia is higher than that of the B-52, but I&#x27;m not sure I trust those numbers.<p>I don&#x27;t think it much matters that it is supersonic. The US enjoys air superiority in all conflicts by virtue of it being the only one with planes in the air. Perhaps it is slightly less vulnerable to SAMs due to its speed advantage? The US is pretty good at neutralizing SAM installations using missiles, long before any planes get over the battlefield.<p>I don&#x27;t see how the B-1B can fit into a modern military.",1418087207

I think if you can somehow cluster the ugly comments together, let the ugly people have that discussion, hidden from view, everything might work out.  Perhaps textual analysis is enough, grouping comments by words, clustering by k-means.  Similar to how dead accounts can still post here, ugly comments should be accepted, clustered into the ugly pile, and shown only to posters who use similar .. language.  If my entire post is &#x27;what a bunch of f__ing sh__heads&#x27;, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to cluster.  Then the public/non-logged-in view would default to the &#x27;civil&#x27; cluster, with showdead/showugly as options, if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.<p>I don&#x27;t think you should stick ratings on <i>people</i>, just to <i>comments</i>.  If people have any input, Zed Shaw would have a really poor rating, let alone Lennart Poettering.  There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with their comments, of course, so they&#x27;d likely be clustered &#x27;civil&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m not too familiar with the domain-relevant quiz: that intrigues me.

I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re unhappy where you live, but I can honestly say that there is an ass-load of wealth, education and age segregation where I live.<p>You can wish for everyone to move into a large urban conglomeration like in some shitty si-fi novel, but the reality is that as long as there is land, people will live there. As they say in real estate, they&#x27;re not making any more of it.<p>And back before you hijacked my point to rant about how you don&#x27;t like where you live and wish others didn&#x27;t either, I would simply restate my original point that trying to <i></i>seek out<i></i> integrated neighbourhoods will most likely lead to unintended consequences as we fail to appreciate that perhaps wealth disparity is more of an issue in 2014 than simply being black or white.<p>And the only reason I brought up Maine was that friends of ours moved down to Portland looking for black and Hispanic people to expose their children to. What they found was a shitty neighbourhood full of fairly uneducated folks with whom they shared almost no culture touchstones and as a result they had a miserable time.<p>That may not be everyone&#x27;s experience, but mashing together black and white people != automatic peacefulness and equality.<p>Is it possible that at some level humans will always segregate themselves based on what is culturally important to themselves?<p>Sometimes we have to look at questions in a hard, unflinching way, and prepare ourselves for the answers that come.",1418086881

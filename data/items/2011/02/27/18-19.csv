Obviously I'll expect that someone making changes to my code is qualified to do so. It's presumably parallel for interactions between multiple designers on the same project – one can make reasoned changes to the other's work.<p>In the described event, there clearly wasn't communication but we don't really know anything more about it.<p>Here's a question, though: let's say you're designing something, say a logo, and there's been a fairly clear idea/requirements laid out, there's some sort of a feedback loop etc. Do you at some point settle on a finished work that you'll offer up and that's it? Or if the client keeps asking you to add more ninjas and make that T red &c., will you acquiesce whether or not it works for you?<p>Edit: or if there's a second designer who has a slightly different idea of how the finished work should look, how is that resolved?",1298832934

2268514,comment,2267861,2267861,0,0,jrwoodruff,,,"During my day job I play the lone designer in an organization built from day one with only software engineers. I suspect the problems that I face there are similar to the problems faced by designers in OSS.<p>1. Communication. Developers use a completely different language than designers. If I come in talking about alignment, developers are thinking 'right left or center justified?' When developers start talking about recursion, I go to sleep.<p>2. Attitude. Often developers seem to think of designers as 'artsy' types, and design as 'nice-to-have,' which is to imply not necessary.<p>3. Attitude. Designers often get emotionally attached to their work and get discouraged or give up when someone disagrees, has a different idea or wants to go another direction.<p>4. I can do it myself. A LOT of developers - particularly less experienced ones - think design is something they can, and are, successfully doing themselves. After all, it's just pixels on a screen, who needs photoshop, right?<p>5. Small changes. Developers often make small changes to designs. 5px extra padding here, no margin there. Blue is blue, right? We'll just use that 10x10 icon the designer did for that page for this 25x25 icon we need on this page. This drives designers insane.<p>6. Eyecandy. This goes to a lack of understanding of the design profession; many think design is just slick icons and pretty colors. Developers who have worked with talented designers know that designers can improve entire systems, helping streamline work flows and adapt the system to actual users.<p>7. Bad designers. Oh yea, there's -a few- of us out there that just picked up GIMP yesterday and think a 600 x 600px favicon should be fine. Even designers capable of really good work may not understand why a 2400x1600 image cannot be used thumbnail-size on the page. This is sad, but I've seen it.<p>8. Lack of trust. Developers may have worked with bad designers in the past. Most likely they have, actually. They'll likely limit the designers interaction to making icons and css rather than involving them in the system design and planning. Designers may not give as much as they could because they don't trust the developers to value their input or even understand and execute their contributions well.<p>Of course, that's not to say all projects are this way, and in fact, when I've been involved in projects from early-on, this is very much not the case.<p>However, I've run into the above issues in my professional career more than once, working face-to-face with people. Trying to make the relationship work online, in projects as distributed as OSS projects are, that's very difficult.<p>But I think it can be done. For distributed design to work, designers need to be brought on board from the beginning, in the planning phases. The initial designer or designers would have to be responsible for creating a clear vision, clear guidelines, and a well-documented style for future contributors to follow. All contributions would have to adhere to those guidelines, and developers would have to be as adept at spotting violations as designers.<p>Part of the problem here is also making designers aware of projects to work on. Designers generally join different message boards (if they join message boards at all), read different blogs and generally don't run in the same circles as developers, possibly with HN being one of the exceptions. I'm not sure how to change that...",1298832721
2268513,comment,2267861,2268333,0,0,vog,,,"<i>""diff""</i><p>Simple pixel-by-pixel ""diffs"" are of course possible, but only useful in trivial cases.<p>What if someone changed the color scheme (which affects almost all pixels)? What if someone moved some part of the image to another part? What about resolution/size changes and multiple layers? What about vector graphics?<p>And the most important thing: How to display that in a way to be easily understood by non-technical people?<p>For hard-core techies, there is of course the option to use a text-based image format. For raster graphics, the ""plain"" variants of PNM come to mind. For vector graphics, SVG or EPS might be good choices. Then, a good (indention-aware) textual diff should produce sensible results - especially if only details were changed.<p><i>""merge""</i><p>Automatic merges are only useful if they aren't too ""clever"". That's important for text and especially important for graphics.<p>So if two distinct areas of an image are edited, a simple merge can and will work. But overlapping changes or even global changes should always result in a conflict.<p>However, if only trivial merges are desirable, most changes will cause conflicts, which would be not much different from the current situation.<p>Also, that kind of merges will already happen automatically with the current (text) merge anyway, provided that formats like PNM, SVG and EPS are used.",1298832668

Just to give one example: you can quickly prototype a class in Python or Ruby and rapidly revise it as your insight with respect to the problem improves. In C++ you have to decide for each member whether it should be an ordinary value, reference, pointer, or smart pointer, which methods to make virtual, behavior for the copy constructor and assignment operator, etc.<p>Of course, this is a double-edged sword. Higher-level languages have made choices so that you do not have to tinker with such details. But that also prevents you to decide on such behavior when necessary.<p>C++0x goes a long way in making many aspects of the language more enjoyable, such as type inference, lambda functions, range based loops and defaulted/deleted methods.

The jump from OS 9 to OS X was extremely easy thanks to Classic and Carbon support, and then the jump from PPC to Intel was easy because of Rosetta. But admittedly this is not on the same level as being able to run 16-bit Windows 3.1 applications on Windows 7.<p>That said:<p>Microsoft's backwards-compatibility policies are great for businesses, who naturally have many special considerations when it comes to legacy applications.<p>Apple's policies, on the other hand, seem to be more geared towards improving the experience for the user. They deprecate libraries and functions of the OS that are no longer relevant to how computing gets done (or how they want it to get done) on the Mac. This helps to ensure that applications keep up with the times.<p>Microsoft don't have this philosophy at all, and so Windows 7 often feels like an arbitrary mash-up of the last 25 years of PC operating systems. There are many many applications in W7, for example, where buttons and interface elements still have a Windows 95-ish feel to them, because they haven't been updated to the new system themes. A famous example in Vista (corrected now in W7) was the 'Add Font' dialogue, which had been exactly the same since Windows 3.1. Another example is mIRC, where (if i remember right) some decades-old Unicode work-around forces the application to use non-Aero title bars.<p>At the risk of sounding like a snob, the whole experience -- to a consumer who appreciates good user interfaces -- just feels kind of amateur-ish, really.",1298831852

All welcome to Vote – What is the future of YC?",,"Your comments are welcomed, but if you don t have much time for that, a feedback of the form a,b,c to the question:<p>YC: From Incubator to a) Biz Franchise?  b)  VC ?  c) Biz practical Education ?'<p>is going to help get a sense of how the YC change affects its culture.<p>-------------------------<p>OK before starting, I want to clarify that I really like and respect what PG and his team does with YC.<p>What I would like to mention is that after the latest development of funding every YC team (http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_10/b4218038672660.htm), YC has changed the business model that is following. I do not know if this is planned change or a result of trust and appreciation from Ron Conway. As a matter of fact I really like the vote of confidence from Mr Conway to all these prominent entrepreneurs.\nNow lets break it down a bit.<p>--------------------------\nPeriod A\nWhat it used to be. A home grown set of teams (8 teams), after a selection from relatively narrow sample (startups primarily focused to software ventures, with founders that can hack their way to prototype and which address a relatively big market).\nThe above was nurtured with close relationships, that beyond common interest had a sense of common dream (according to PG a team can change their initial model, based on advice given).\nWhat is the new identity of YC? (is YC pivoting?)<p>--------------------------\nPeriod B\nA batch of 43 teams. I am sure that the networking logistics are a big advantage (http://ycombinator.com/atyc.html ==> paragraph about size), but the intimacy level will probably change (I do not want to be pessimistic but this is a probable outcome of the growth). Now is this good of bad?\nPositive 1) Bigger network 2) More traction 3) Even with same chances of succeeding, the financial outcome better. e.g. with 2 (10 % chance) good exits in 20 teams(in a year), maybe a 5-10 million exit after 2-3 years, but with 8 (10%) good exits from 86 teams, the prospective outcome is 40-80 million exit.\nNow if you can achieve this with the same structure (people-resources), then this is an amazing productivity boost.\nHowever the differentiator of Period A was the close relationship with PG and teams. This is not going to be the main rule for Period B. Now if the skills-mentorship of PG are transferable or shared by new instructors in YC, then maybe we are talking about a franchise style mentoring. This is possible, but surely there will be imitators with probably similar success rates. This model seems a bit more like a “practical business MBA”. Maybe Universities will try this model as well.\nWhat about the 150.000 for each team?\nThis is actually a tricky point. VCs or even Angel Investors work with the 1/10 rule. If you want to fund 10/10 then to keep the same rate of success you need to fund another 90 startups outside YC(I don't know if Mr Conway funds so many startups).\nMoreover we have another shift. The YC looks no longer like an incubator, but rather like an Angel VC which has already invested from day-1 to all teams. Quite a bet to take, considering that most teams don't have the working prototype beforehand.\nHope that all goes well for YC, because we definitely want to see more success stories.<p>So, what do you think? How will YC evolve after the latest changes?",1298831382

He seems to be saying that using ""straight C++"" would mean using the worst parts of the language in the worst ways, but not taking advantage of the features that make C++ usable.  If he really thinks everyone uses macros, code generators, or code transformers to do real-world C++, then he's wrong.  I've been using C++ professionally for almost ten years now, and I've never seen anything like that except:  a few legacy macro tricks that we easily replaced with better, non-macro techniques; and Qt's preprocessor, which we never actually used in production code.<p>Style points for C++ have been rehashed endlessly.

I'm not sure why this is a ding on C++.  Doesn't any reasonably powerful language have performance pitfalls?  Don't use CLOS in your embedded systems, folks.<p><i>C++ as a medium for our art looks more like statuary marble than modeling clay: it requires a team of muscular stone cutters under the guidance of a genius in order to produce some amazing sculptures. And once a given idea has been translated into the stone, you hardy can change it without re-sculpting most of it or having to work in the constraints that the shape it currently has impose on you.</i><p>This is only true if your system is badly factored or if you are averse to recompiling.  ""Ahhh, arrgh, no, I refuse to change the interface of this fundamental class referenced by every other object in the system because the next compile-link cycle will take ten minutes!  I'll leave it crappy for the rest of eternity just so I don't have to wait ten minutes for a compile, or because my approach to changing this extremely fundamental class is to keep making haphazard changes to its interface until my code finally works, so my ten or twelve compile-link cycles will cumulatively take <i>almost two hours</i>.""  Fine, we'll have an adult make the change instead.<p>Now I'm <i>really</i> not suggesting that it doesn't suck when you have to wait ten minutes to recompile your system when you change an interface that every other source file in your system includes, but I hope recompilation time is not the weightiest consideration in that case.<p><i>It's not a coincidence that the more a language is dynamic, the less need there is for fancy debugging tools. Who needs a watch window indeed, if I can just add on the fly a widget on screen that graphs the value of a given variable?</i><p>This is a legitimate complaint.  Building instrumentation into a C++ system is a pain in the ass, and it will never be as powerful as in a language with introspection.<p><i>Well, the art of sculpting in C++, the art of design, becomes really the art of subdividing our sculpture in pieces, the real design challenge is all about how to cut or work into pieces. Too many of them and the sculpture will be a fragile and ugly mess (translation: craptastically slow OOP shit). Too little and we loose flexibility. </i><p>As far as I can tell, the point here is that if C++ was a better language, bad design wouldn't be a problem.  If it took C++ to drive him to consider OO design principles, I'd hate to see the code he wrote in other OO languages.  Also, decomposition is not the only consideration.  There are cross-cutting concerns such as memory management, logging, and instrumentation.<p>The design principles at the end of the post are better and more comprehensively covered by ""Large-Scale C++ Software Design"":  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Software-Design-John-Lakos/dp/0201633620"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Software-Design-John-Lakos...</a>  Some of the language points in that book reflect the immaturity of C++ implementations when the book was written, but the design guidelines are still relevant.<p>In general, it's very hard to say anything original about C++.

Also, this may come as a shock to the web generation, but C++ is a topic that is very well covered by available books.

A record, or struct, is a single unit value, while a hash-table, or map, is an aggregate container. There is an implicit contract in place; a record is guaranteed to have JUST the fields it's defined to have, while a map can grow at run time (are you going to test for the fields you want and ignore the rest? quack quack! you can't add fields to a record at runtime, so the two are NOT interchangeable. Equality is a transitive relation, while duck-typing is not.)<p>A record is a generalization of the concept of ""value"" beyond data types immediately representable by machine. While a hash-table is a generalization of arrays, an aggregate of values, addressable by an index (hash-tables remedy the silly assumption that an index must be of an integral value.)<p>To give an analogy; it's like asking what's the best way to group a bunch of papers (folder, envlope, binder) and then hearing someone suggest ""bookshelf!"".<p>Again, OK short-term, but stinks.

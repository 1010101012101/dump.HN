I wish I'd done something like an Open University (is there a US equivalent to this organisation?) course instead.",1190335959

57711,comment,57298,57298,0,0,pocketofposies,,,"I was amused by your post considering I am currently in medical research and am using my current job to hopefully fund a modest startup, since I feel that I am at heart an entrepreneur.<p>While there are some very rewarding aspects of medical research, please understand that it is not all unicorns, roses, and saved lives.  I have had the opportunity to work with wonderful professionals and amazing patients, but I have also experienced mind-numbing ineptitude and questionable research practices.  Like any industry, there is good and bad.<p>I don't want to discourage you from getting involved in research if that is what you truly feel is your passion, however, I believe that regardless of industry, it begins with you.  If your talent is in entrepreneurship and investing, you might be most effective in your area of expertise. (Of course, if it's lost its luster and you want something more personally fulfilling, that is a different issue).<p>One area that I am interested in is micro-lending, and I think it would be a good way of putting your talents to use.  You could do something in the developing world or something in the US, depending on your interests.  If you have not already, I would recommend that you read ""Banker to the Poor"" by Muhammad Yunus.  Best of luck to you.",1190334866
57710,comment,57538,57562,0,0,kingnothing,,,"For those who are unfamiliar with cooking, you have to use oil when cooking in a wok. Peanut or vegetable oil are best -- they have high smoke points and won't burn in the temperatures required to properly cook in a wok. Start off with a tablespoon or so, and add more as necessary to prevent food from sticking.<p>Edit: And don't buy a nonstick wok, get one made from carbon steel. It's a bad idea to cook at high temperatures with a nonstick coating, and it won't give you the savory flavor that woks are known for.",1190334861
57709,comment,57538,57669,0,0,shankys,,,"Interestingly enough, we actually live off something very similar for our startup.  However, what we do requires less work than pg's setup for the lazy ones among you.<p>Buy a rice cooker and large quantities of white rice. Then buy 6-packs of various pre-made packages at TastyBite (<a href=""http://www.tastybite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tastybite.com</a>).  This sounds like an ad for TastyBite, but their product seriously is amazing for startup founders.<p>Once your rice is done, just open up your TastyBite and put it over the rice.  The packages last a year unrefrigerated, taste good (and are reasonably good for you), and only cost two dollars a package.  There's a pretty wide variety of things you can buy from TastyBite (all of them go well with rice), so you won't be eating the same thing again and again.<p>I consider it one of the smartest things we've ever done at our startup.",1190334732

I wonder if some of these are true ""widgets"" (plug in anywhere with simple script a novice can use, interactive, live updating, multi-user, etc) or are just glorified links back to Amazon. Looks like it's a little of both -- you can have as much fun as you want, as long as it has to do with some kind of Amazon product! LOL.

Marc was not just one of many students working on it, he was the most prominent developer on the project.  That's my recollection, but it's also what I find when I look for sources to cite:<p><a href=""http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0262.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0262.ht...</a>",1202752038

Maybe its possible if you get really creative, but I didn't have the patience to try.",1202751642
113469,comment,113244,113341,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The problem with the now-you-see-it-now-you-don't approach is that, when you separate the code and the comments, they quickly diverge. The veteran will tinker with the code but never touch the comments, because she doesn't see them and doesn't care to see them. Then the comments become worse than useless, because they will actively mislead or confuse the newb who reads and writes them.<p>This is a special case of the general problem with metadata: you can't keep it in sync with the real data. This is what leads, e.g., Ruby programmers to become religious fanatics about DRY.<p>The other problem is that not all comments are equal: some are fluff, some are fluffy-looking but destined to become HTML documentation and are therefore important to keep around, some are terse and vital, some are hints for future refactorings and bug fixes. A system which hides all comments isn't really what I would want; I'd want to hide the fluffy ones and keep the important ones visible. And suddenly you need meta-metadata, and your editor becomes baroque, and your head explodes.",1202751419

I used the 256 slice to power a few of my Rails applications, but I upgraded to the 512 so I can add more.<p>The best experience I had with Slicehost was the upgrade from 256 to 512.  It was a couple clicks on their admin panel, 30 minutes of downtime, and then a quick SSH to verify everything was good.",1202750696

I tend to think you are largely correct for certain groups and practices, though that's just gut feeling.<p>I read most of Founders at Work; I don't recall much indiscriminate broadcasting of ideas and intent, but it's been a while.<p>For myself I find it useful to kick around ideas with a small local group of developers and business owners.  The collective Bozometer  is very handy, and indeed people are good about suggesting things I would not have thought of.<p>I'm not so sure that scales well to the general Internet and infinite strangers, but I've nothing concrete to back that up.  Just more gut feeling.",1202749882

113449,comment,113244,113341,0,0,mojuba,,,"You can collapse/expand comment blocks in Visual Studio, although I'm not sure if VS can hide all of them at once. If not, it's a matter of writing a very simple plug-in. But anyway, that's not my point.<p>I think the idea of turning your plain-text source code into a 3D monster that requires a special rendering engine - is a wrong idea if you are in the webapp business. My server was under a massive attack recently and what saved my arse was  terse and beautiful server-side code that I changed with vi on the fly. But of course we all know it's not only about attacks. Thus, unless we have magical IDEs that can edit and compile projects remotely on a Mars Rover, the conservative mantra <i>Source code must be plain text</i> wins.<p>So there's no hope for noobs. Either you jump onto the veterans' boat straight away or you don't even start programming. Ok, just kidding.<p>Damn Steve Yegge, my comments become longer than usual after reading his posts.",1202749715

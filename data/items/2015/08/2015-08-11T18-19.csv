In less than five minutes and without writing any code, you can set up a page to start automatically charging customers on a recurring schedule (handled securely via Stripe).<p>Here&#x27;s an example page for a student organization I help run (we&#x27;re experimenting with this idea): <a href=""https://tidery.com/yhack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tidery.com/yhack</a><p>I think this problem has become relatively manageable for developers, but still isn&#x27;t as straightforward for non-developers or for people who want to test ideas quickly.

10043482,comment,10036061,10036061,0,0,unabst,,,"Regarding NBC, their failure wasn&#x27;t in the hamburger menu itself. They didn&#x27;t use it properly.<p>Their design had what looks like a menubar which is the precise anti-pattern to a menu-button. Those items, and what is showing already as top page content, is guaranteed to catch everyone&#x27;s attention first. Those menu-button items are not only hidden and require an extra click, by design they have been made less important. And since so many sites have de-cluttered themselves by simplification, users&#x27; first impression is that they got rid of everything for the better... except it wasn&#x27;t what they did, so basically everything under that menu was unreachable.<p>Two things would have been better. First, they could have kept the menu icon but had it expanded on the top page so that people would see those items as top page content, and also make the intuitive connection that there was a button that&#x27;s associated with them. When the reader goes deeper, the menu items could then safely be hidden, with the user intuitively fetching them via the button as needed. Second, they could have given the button a name, instead of use the icon. For example, Amazon&#x27;s &quot;shop by department&quot; button is the equivalent of NBC&#x27;s hamburger menu. But since they have a menubar, instead of having a menu-button on a menubar, they put a menu-item instead by giving it a name and an equal member of the top selection. This upholds the primary design pattern in use.<p>NBC&#x27;s designers went for the hamburger without knowing how to use it or understanding what made it popular. You cannot mix competing philosophies and color is no substitute for broken intuitions. Even now that they settled for the menu-bar, they don&#x27;t have an at-state, under &quot;more&quot; we see the same items in the menu in different order, and they use the pinned menu that doesn&#x27;t go away even when you scroll -- a design already falsified by the frame paradigm of 1999.",1439319200

RethinkDB is, for my use, the first database I&#x27;ve ever actually really loved (and React.js+flux the first web framework).

The heuristics that drive modern food distribution are the result of a real world genetic algorithm that is already thousands of generations deep...and miniscule incremental improvements have been the subject of PhD Theses for over a hundred years now. You don&#x27;t optimize on top of that by writing a web service. Supply Chain Management <i>may not be technologically advanced</i> in its usage of enterprise software, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that their ideas and processes are stupid. At best, it means there are some annoying frictions in the industry in the way that they interact with other industries (and there are actually plenty of viable startup opportunities to fix this). The presumption of stupidity[2] regarding the existing state of logistics and supply chain management killed this company, just like how it killed Webvan, and is going to kill a whole host of startups in the distribution and delivery space within the next few years.

10043214,comment,10042695,10042695,0,0,pfooti,,,"I live in Good Eggs central - san francisco, and I foresee problems that are still ahead for this startup. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I really want Good Eggs to succeed, but they have quality control issues that need to be addressed and scale <i>very</i> poorly.<p>Specifically, I&#x27;ve been a customer of theirs for years, and in the past two years in particular, I&#x27;ve seen prices go up pretty dramatically and quality in some cases go down.<p>It used to be the case that Good Eggs produce and meats were farmers-market quality at really good prices, delivered. Now it&#x27;s the case that the produce feels like farmers-market seconds (the produce I get from them regularly has only a few more days of freshness left and are decidedly <i>not</i> the fruits or veggies I would pick if I went to the store on my own), and the meat and fish prices have gone well beyond the cost of the same meat from other sources (say a trip to a regular market). Top this all off with persistent packaging and logistics errors - my last order contained someone else&#x27;s frozen lunch pies, didn&#x27;t contain any of the cheese I ordered, and was delivered an hour before the actual delivery window I requested (and contained fish, so if I hadn&#x27;t already been home, this would have been a problem).<p>Good Eggs is really good at fixing these problems - I email their customer service and they credit me for stuff I don&#x27;t have and throw in a $5 off coupon for next time or whatever. If inconsistent quality or mispacks were rare, this&#x27;d be perfect. The problem is, it is not rare at all. I have definitely fallen off in my use of their service - if I&#x27;m paying the same price, I might as well just go to Andronico&#x27;s, Whole Foods, or the Ferry Building (or Gus&#x27;s or Rainbow, or Berkeley Bowl ... there&#x27;s a lot of great grocery stores in the SF region) so I can pick out what I want, and sometimes (especially at Berkeley Bowl) get a way better price.<p>They need a better process for vetting the product they get from distributors (and possibly a better contract when it comes to rejecting low-quality stuff) and a better process for getting people&#x27;s stuff into their bags. That&#x27;s not scaling, that&#x27;s core competency. It may be the case that this <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> scale, can they deliver food that&#x27;s sufficiently high quality that I could say, &#x27;If I went to the store, I&#x27;d have chosen that tomato&#x27; at a price that&#x27;s competitive with the store? That&#x27;s a difficult problem to solve and requires well-established relationships with vendors.",1439316764

I personally dont like that the majority of contributions come from a relatively small number of people or organizations. I would like the rules changed so that they are more egalitarian.<p>One possible solution is only individuals (no companies, PACs, organizations) can contribute up to $100 per candidate. And the money comes from federal taxes rather than people spending from their wallets directly. You could argue that whoever gets the most money in this system will also win the election because people are essentially voting with their wallets. And even poor people can participate which is the reason for the federal taxes.<p>As far as governing, if something like that was the system then politicians would hopefully feel more free to do what they think is right rather than what they think will appease their donors. Even if that doesn&#x27;t turn out to be true, I still think it is a good thing to make campaign finance more egalitarian because it eliminates one potential source of corruption.",1439316362

Just to take one for instance:<p>&quot;&quot;It&#x27;s still around&quot; in no way leads to &quot;it&#x27;s the best choice&quot;, logically.&quot;<p>Yes, I know. It&#x27;s why I never made the claim that it&#x27;s the best. I think XMPP has some serious flaws that kept it from being much more successful.<p>I also think XML isn&#x27;t any of them. Convert XMPP naively to JSON, and it&#x27;s still too difficult for people to bring up a stream and send an IM. One change I&#x27;d make, for instance, is for initiating a stream to default in one tag to a sensible initialized state, the state people expect a new IM stream to be in, and allow the user to <i>override</i> the defaults to be more manual, rather than what it is now. The spec is full of things like that, though, to some extent IM is a harder problem than people think.<p>&quot;XML&quot; is just a cognitively-available excuse. It&#x27;s not the core problem. Personally, if I had to write a new protocol, JSON wouldn&#x27;t actually be in the running; I&#x27;d either stick to XML or go to something like Protocol Buffers. I&#x27;d say JSON is actually in a really <i>bad</i> place for a big IM protocol, where it&#x27;s still very, very verbose and has bad parsing characteristics (text-based, must parse whole message before you can do anything with it) but <i>also</i> fails at things XML is good at, like rich text and extensibility (JSON is <i>bad</i> at mixed text). And both are pretty bad at being streamed, for what it&#x27;s worth.<p>&quot;For all practical purposes and intents, a key along the lines of `joepie91:carbons` (ie. a URN-like) would be sufficient - nickname and company name reuse is already non-zero but limited, and the cumulative chance of both having a name reused and working with the same kind of data (ie. conflict-sensitive) is negligible.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not really disagreement. You just want to run the risk of using a shorter URN than everybody else, for the convenience of... uh... not sure actually, since this is all auto-generated JSON anyhow. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re saving the user typing, and choosing JSON means you&#x27;ve already thrown away wire-space efficiency. (Or are using gzip or something, and gzip&#x27;ed XML-XMPP and gzip&#x27;ed JSON-XMPP will be virtually identical in size on a stable stream.) You can already use that exact URN as an XML namespace today, if you so choose.",1439316043

Cross-platform support would be nice and as others have pointed out, PowerShell really took over Batch especially when Microsoft took care of the slow loading issue. I personally would rather have an extension of Bash rather than a brand new language, but that&#x27;s me.

The ability to link a HN username to an IRC handle is also nice, however the bot is quite verbose in the channel.<p>Couldn&#x27;t commands like !username be issued in private messages instead of the public channel? Worse than the bot responding in public, it has two lines when a nick doesn&#x27;t have a username linked to it. In one example, someone was looking for user information and was drowning out conversation in the channel with bot messages (probably unintentionally), making 4 or 5 queries, most without a linked username.<p>Another suggestion: stop the welcome /msg from hnguardian for people who either don&#x27;t have a HN handle or don&#x27;t want to link it. I realize it may be somewhat counter to goals of HN (since it would likely prefer people to both have a handle <i>and</i> link it) but for those who&#x27;d prefer otherwise it would be a better experience.

Neither study represents anything like a conclusive outcome, but both must be read with an open mind -- who funded the studies, how strong is the evidence, what are the p-values, and so forth.<p>But let&#x27;s step back. Do you know what&#x27;s missing  from this exchange, and do you know why such exchanges tend to be so wordy and inconclusive? Both of us are discussing symptoms, descriptions, not causes. This issue will never move forward until people move beyond psychiatric descriptions and locate a biological cause for depression.<p>Science requires a focus on causes, explanations -- descriptions aren&#x27;t enough. And <i>this is not science</i>, because psychiatry is not science.<p>For those who doubt the central role of explanations in science, I have an anecdote -- Doctor Dubious invents a new treatment for the common cold. His treatment is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until the patient gets better. Sometimes the treatment takes a week, but it always works — the cold sufferer always recovers. So, why doesn&#x27;t Doctor Dubious get a Nobel Prize for his breakthrough?<p>The answer is that the procedure is only a description — shake the gourd, patient recovers — without an explanation, without a basis for actually learning anything or being truthful about the connection between cause and effect.

SAT is the archetypal NP-complete problem (kinda like travelling salesman), but the details don&#x27;t matter much for the article&#x27;s key point:<p><i>The most fundamental challenge to emerge goes to the very heart of computational complexity theory. This theory is based typically on worst-case complexity analysis, which focuses on instances that are the most difficult to solve. Worst-case complexity analysis has proven to be quite tractable mathematically, much more, than say average-case complexity analysis. It also seems intuitive from a practical point of view; for example, a worst-case upper bound for an algorithm offers an absolute upper bound on its running time in practice. Thus, worst-case analysis is the standard approach in complexity theory. What has become clear, however, and also became painfully evident at the SAT workshop, is that worst-case analysis actually sheds very little light on the behavior of algorithms on real-life instances. For example, theorists have demonstrated that current SAT-solving algorithms must take exponential time to solve certain families of SAT instances. Practitioners simply shrug at such bounds, while they continue to apply their solvers to very large but practically solvable SAT instances. One role of theory is to provide guidance to engineering, but worst-case (and average-case) complexity seems to offer little guidance for problems that are difficult in theory but feasible in practice. What is needed is a new computational complexity model, which will capture better the concept of &quot;complexity in practice.</i><p>Great insights.<p>In other words, we rarely care about an algorithm&#x27;s worst-case performance. We care about average performance over the kind of problem it has to solve. This is terribly difficult to analyse from theory (partly because &quot;the kind of problem it has to solve&quot; is hard to define), so empiricism prevails - at least for SAT (see also: Analytic Combinatorics).",1409603238

Here&#x27;s what it says in the places you didn&#x27;t quote:<p>&quot;Meta-analyses of antidepressant efficacy based on data from published trials reveal benefits that are statistically significant, but of marginal clinical significance [1].&quot;<p>&quot;Although the difference between these means easily attained statistical significance (Table 2, Model 3a), it does not meet the three-point drug–placebo criterion for clinical significance used by NICE.&quot;<p>&quot;Although drug type and duration of treatment were unrelated to improvement, the drug versus placebo difference remained significant, and amount of improvement was a function of baseline severity (Table 2, Model 1a).&quot;<p>&quot;The difference between drug and placebo exceeded NICE&#x27;s 0.50 standardized mean difference criterion at comparisons exceeding 28 in baseline severity.&quot;<p>> First, you&#x27;re overlooking the fact that the studies that got SSRIs approved in the first place relied on animal studies using the same animals.<p>SSRIs were approved several decades ago, but studies in the last decade still show the same effects, e.g. the study I linked to above, which was conducted in 2009 using fluoxetine, which was approved in 1987. The lifespan of a mouse is around a year, so there is zero chance that any of the animals are the same. In Figure 1, it reproduces the result that antidepressants reduce depressive behaviors in mouse models on a variety of tests. This is not an isolated result; basically all of the rodent studies show similar findings.<p>> Second, imagine a scientist saying &quot;... just because mice genetically depleted of serotonin do not show depression-like symptoms does not mean that toying with serotonin levels in a normal brain cannot alleviate depression.&quot; Surely you see the logical error you&#x27;re making here -- the argument essentially says, &quot;if it hasn&#x27;t been disproven, then it might be true.&quot; It equates an absence of evidence, with evidence.<p>This is in response to your claim that &quot;the drugs could not possibly work.&quot; The drugs <i>can</i> work even if serotonin-depleted animals are not depressed. And as I&#x27;ve stated, there is an abundance of evidence that the drugs <i>do</i> work in mice, even though serotonin-depleted mice are not depressed.<p>> > In fact, antidepressant treatment does alleviate depression in mice ...<p>> Not according to the FDA&#x27;s meta-analysis quoted above.<p>That meta-analysis is in <i>humans</i>. Mice are not humans! That is a big reason why it&#x27;s so hard to develop good antidepressants in the first place.<p>> Apart from a well-documented Placebo effect, which therapeutic action are you alluding to?<p>The therapeutic action in mice, which is replicated in the study I linked to and many others.<p>As far as DBS goes, one of the problems with determining if DBS actually works for depression is that most studies have not been placebo controlled. Also, the largest study that I&#x27;m aware of was recently shut down by the FDA for lack of efficacy: <a href=""http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/01/broaden-trial-of-dbs-for-treatment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/01/broaden-trial-of-dbs...</a>",1409603129

The recent NIMH ruling, to which I alluded in my post above, suggests that the granting agencies aren&#x27;t going to wait for that burden of evidence to be met ---- psychiatry is not a science, is not an evidence-based practice, and can&#x27;t masquerade as such without evidence.<p>> Anyone with Google at their fingertips can find a dozen peer-reviewed articles about serotonin&#x27;s link to mood and behavior.<p>Yes, and there&#x27;s a name for that: confirmation bias.

And how could this most recent study, which shows no correlation between serotonin and depression, survive the critical eyes of editors and reviewers to find its way into print?<p>The FDA meta-analysis, which for the first time included studies that the drug companies funded but then chose not to publish, and which showed no clinically significant effect from SSRIs, is not by itself conclusive, but the silence that followed it certainly is. There are too many interested parties involved for that study to go unchallenged ... if a challenge were possible.<p>This most recent study simply shows why SSRIs don&#x27;t work -- because serotonin and depression aren&#x27;t correlated, therefore SSRIs <i>cannot possibly work, in principle</i>.",1409602025

If I, a random nobody, had something that had its running time increased by a factor of ~50 (simple recursive-descent-ish parser for coercing tabulated data from one format to another - just call substring to trim off the first token repeatedly), how many dev hours were required overall to fix the results of the change? And there&#x27;s no simple alternative either or way to preserve the old behavior - the simplest one, rolling your own String class or wrapper, ends up being relatively slow and annoying.<p>And &quot;all&quot; of this would be solved by having a proper way of doing array slicing - for things like substring&#x27;s previous worst case (something like a single character being referenced in a substring holding up a gigabyte+-sized string) Java&#x27;s garbage collector could recognize that the array was only referenced through slices of part of the array, copy that section into another array (updating references to it), and free the large one.<p>Also, Java&#x27;s lack of a way to specify that a class is immutable (and that all children classes thereof must also be) is frustrating.

If I see a crowd that's larger than normal trying to pack itself into a full train, odds seem to be about 90% that the next train will be significantly lighter, AND that it'll show up pretty soon.<p>I think the reason is that the first train to show up is delayed, so more time passes before it shows up, allowing a crowd to build up. They, then, all try to cram on the train that FINALLY got there because GOD who KNOWS how long it'll take for the NEXT ONE to get here.

Better to go for some mentoring / consultancy sessions with these guys and by that create incentives / improvements with your in-house developers. The rule one of them is as good as up to 20 mediocre developers generally applies.<p>(2) There is a shortage of 25-28 year old senior developers with 10+ years of uninterrupted work experience, having all plus the most exotic skills (each at least 5 years), being in a job with another company and willing to stop there tomorrow and work for 50K or less p.a. gross (that's about 2'300 per month net see cost of living above) - at least double the salary and suddenly people might become interested in job offerings - ask yourself if that marketing guy who's that great in selling himself is really worth 400k p.a. or 200k would also do and you might actually be able to deliver a product after paying your developers an appropriate salary.<p>(3) There is no shortage in mediocre / average developers with high frustration levels and often outdated skills. Some of them might have been outstanding developers before, but got so frustrated by the silly low monies paid to them in an industry juggling with dozens of billions at a time. Treat those fair and spend some time and you might re-surface their outstanding skills. It's a gamble and might also backfire.<p>(4) There is no shortage of lobbyists / politicians / industry guys that trumpet around that there is a shortage in developers - we know at least for the EU and the U.S. this is to lower the wages of developers by bringing in developers from low income countries that are completely dependent on having their visas renewed all the time.<p>Overall with developers you most of the time get what you pay for and how you treat them.",1368647899

I personally agree with that view, as everything I have seen suggests that no standalone Bitcoin economy is possible.  On the other hand, a large number of people in the Bitcoin community disagree and seem to think that a Bitcoin economy can be bootstrapped.<p>""Require enough paperwork, and somewhere a sufficient transgression will be found.""<p>The paperwork in this case was not very complicated; it plainly asks if the business transfers money at the request of its customers, and MtGox simply answered ""no.""  It is not as though MtGox is being investigated for not filling out paperwork or for a bad answer to an ambiguous or confusing question.  MtGox was already engaged in exchanging Bitcoin for USD and was already performing transfers of money for its customers when those forms were filled out.<p>I agree with your general sentiment, but I seriously doubt that anyone in the government was sitting there saying, ""Bitcoin is a threat, let's take it down!  Start with this exchange!""  More likely, some regulator somewhere saw that Bitcoin was becoming popular and said, ""Let's make sure they are following the same laws that other financial companies are expected to follow.""  Those laws predate Bitcoin; they may have been set up to protect large banks from small competitors, or they may have been created to protect individual Americans from fraud and predatory companies, but that is an entirely separate issue.",1368647739

As a configuration engineer who occasionally programs (""one-man devops team"", a co-worker called me), I've looked at Javascript with disdain. A two-month stint as a full time Javascript programmer (in extjs) a while back didn't help that... the language felt awkward and unnecessarily crufty to me.<p>But now that I'm developing from scratch for my own startup, I'm finding myself back at Javascript. Node.js is actually solving problems for me as a server, and I'm plowing through a number of Javascript animation tools for data visualization problems (D3 is currently winning). And discovering CoffeeScript has made the whole process more pleasant, hiding the unaesthetic syntax issues and giving me best-of-breed features from elegant languages like Python, Ruby, and Haskell. List comprehensions in Javascript? Yes, please!<p>I'm not to the point where I can find charm in the icky parts yet, but I'm finding Javascript solves problems I can't solve elegantly any other way, and CoffeeScript goes a long way toward hiding the cruft.",1368645867

I dislike it because it's huge and difficult. It won't let me work simply. It is slow to start and slow to use. If I want to import a project, I have to manually copy the .project file and manually edit it because Eclipse is too retarded to just import a simple folder from the filesystem in anything like a sane manner. I have to tweak a bunch of crap in the messy menus and dialogs before I get a functional debugger, different for each project context. The UI is slow, meaning it loads slowly, and switching from Debug->Code view lags horribly. Using the internal windowing and docking system for widgets is hard and sometimes I have to reset the whole thing to get it back to a manageable place.<p>Those are my main complaints. I haven't used IntelliJ so I don't know if it is much or any better. I kind of feel like Eclipse exhibits the primary pervasive cultural philosophy amongst Java developers; create something massive and unwieldy, embed some useful functionality somewhere beneath layers of tedious boilerplate, and bundle it all up and act confused when no one wants anything to do with it. This is further exhibited by Java's attachment to XML, its packaging mechanisms (wars and jars everywhere), and its general verbosity.<p>I appreciate the intention behind all of this, but I think it's totally non-functional from an outsider's perspective.

and though i'm sure i could configure eclipse to behave the same way...out of the box intellij was very predictive for me. not just on obvious auto completes either. it seems to know what you want to do as you're typing. similar to the way BMWs communicate what's happening on the road to you and you begin to feel like you're one with the car. that level of interaction between me and the IDE makes it much easier to get code from brain to file imo",1368644420

The same goes for variable names; the difference is that you were presumably going to have variables in your code anyway.<p>More constructive commenting advice:<p>If your comments are supposed to explain what the code does, give a few extra minutes to considering whether the code could be clearer (some tasks might require complicated code that merits comments, but most tasks can be accomplished with self-explanatory code).<p>On the other hand, sometimes there are external reasons, not enscapulated within your code, why you must do something surprising.  This unequivocally merits comments.  ""I did this because of RFC #XYZ"" or ""Partner FooCorp needs this bizarre format, see /global/path/to/spec"", or ""our data has such-and-such a distribution, thus this surprising approach, which improves the 99th %ile latency"".",1368644420

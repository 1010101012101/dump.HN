For example, some people think that new programmers should start low-level (such as with C) and learn how memory management works; others think that a higher-level language (such as Java) is better and abstracts away all of the things that people can learn later. And of course, there's also web app programming, which brings in another curve",1303142389

There are already a number of sites that allow you to post tasks/projects for money; elance, odesk, freelancer.com. They have some good points and some bad points.

One of the requirements for this abstractness is everyone has their 'own' ideas of what 'easy' is, thus you always end up seeing framework N1,N2,N3... and so on.<p>If you take a look at Rails, there is much argument about ""well I don't like Ruby, much prefer lang xyz"", or ""I don't like the magic, I like abc"" (just giving an example). This exists for everything out there today, because we are all different.<p>It feels like everyone expects to just load up an IDE and start coding, but this will probably never be the case again. The Internet has brought us the ability to not only fork code but fork ideas. Having to rely on a main branch of well water (read: visual studio, xcode) leaves you powerless (see my main point about giving up control) in the end, (eventually as iterations increase).<p>Perhaps when something is not in physical form, the concept easily escapes us. There are many ways to 'hammer a nail', or 'code hello world'. The basic principal remains the same, blunt force 'could' be applied or you could just use a screw, or... (you see my point).<p>It is again probably the Internet which has increased the iteration of improvement, and obviously people do find it confusing to have to 'shop' amongst hundreds of options. If you look at it, it's no different than what we do at a grocery or hardware store today.<p>So, maybe it is really one's lack of understanding with the fundamental problem at hand (that your trying to solve).

2459423,comment,2459020,2459020,3,0,tokenadult,,,"I have just read the fine blog post, which taught me the term ""need for cognition."" Having read it, I posted a Facebook link to the blog post visible to my 554 FB friends titled with the question, ""The suggestion of one research finding is that people who like to use social networking sites don't like intellectual challenge. Can you think of any counterexamples?"" I will see what happens over the next several hours.<p>The use case I see most frequently on Facebook among my circle of FB friends is posting links to external publications to elicit discussion--the general use case here at Hacker News. I think people with need for cognition can learn from Hacker News, and if they shape their Facebook friend list intentionally they can learn from Facebook. The second person to Facebook-friend me, connections with whom drew me into the majority of my friend list on Facebook, is a parent I met at conferences on education of gifted children, an occasional participant in email discussions of parenting issues and education reform issues. Over the years I have developed a lot of email relationships (the old-fashioned term would be epistolary friendships<p><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-0208.2006.tb00643.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-0208.2006....</a><p>for friendships maintained mostly by writing letters) with parents all over the world who are frustrated by anti-intellectual school systems and who want education for their children that challenges their children intellectually and helps them learn at full speed throughout childhood. In such a friendship environment, I encounter a lot of intellectual challenge. I have to LOOK IT UP if I make a factual assertion that differs from what someone else thinks (much as many people do here on HN). My friends are not screened by occupation, place of birth, country of citizenship, political persuasion, religion, or any other criterion but interest in pursuing learning and improving education for everyone.<p>I think intellectually curious people make use of Facebook as ""free riders"" in much the same way they used to make use of AOL as free riders. (This is not even to mention the number of people who learn from HN without posting much here.) I can well believe that many people waste a lot of time on Facebook, so much so that my slogan in Facebook comments is ""Friends don't let friends play Facebook games,"" but high use of social networking sites (FB or HN) is at most a correlate of lower intellectual engagement at the group level, rather than lower intellectual challenge being an invariant outcome of heavy use of social media. The study design reported in the submitted link is not an adequate study design<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>to make the claim that all persons who use social media a lot fail to challenge their thinking.<p>P.S. By the time I had finished typing this comment, I had already received a reply to the submitted link on Facebook: ""Well, I don't know people's IQ's, but many of my friends on FB have graduate degrees and almost all of them have bachelor degrees. I think it can provide an extra outlet for those of us who want to have more intellectual discussions and may be limited by our day to day/ face to face interactions."" The writer of that comment is a very smart woman now living mostly as a stay-at-home mom for her exceptionally gifted young children (one of whom has been a pupil of mine in the mathematics courses run by my nonprofit organization). As I just edit this comment by adding a few more details, I see other replies challenging the assertion that heavy users of social media are in all cases persons who avoid intellectual challenge.<p>P.P.S. after further edit: A recent comment from a FB friend is ""Does the fact that there are multiple Rhodes Scholars on my friend list (and they have regular activity...) count as data?"" Of course, that friend knows that that doesn't exactly count as data, but then another friend commented, ""Perhaps the high-NFC subjects of this particular study just couldn't find other high-NFC friends on FB."" It surely does matter how intentionally one seeds one's friend list and how one models intellectual behavior on FB.",1303140669

The set of linear functions from a finite dimensional vector space over the reals to the reals is a vector space.  It turns out to be isomorphic to the original vector space, but not naturally isomorphic.  This second vector space is called the <i>dual</i>.  The reason why is that the dual of the dual is naturally isomorphic to the original vector space.  The natural isomorphism is defined like this.  If <i>v</i> is a vector in the original space, and <i>f</i> is a linear function, then map <i>v</i> to the function <i>v'</i> defined by <i>v'(f) = f(v)</i>.<p>As difficult as it was for me to understand this, it does turn out to be important.

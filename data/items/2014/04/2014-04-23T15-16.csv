7634808,comment,7632094,7632396,2,0,nzp,,,"But the thing is, why is this considered a problem really?  Should we only have sex with our enemies or persons we don&#x27;t like?  I understand the underlying reasoning, the questions are for the most part rhetorical, but I just don&#x27;t find the whole idea very well thought out, not to mention it&#x27;s completely wrong in the &quot;always&quot; part.  Also, I never heard people say gay men or lesbians can never be friends.  Why is that?  Is there some bogus assumption that hetero sexuality is somehow different in nature?<p>The point is that the &quot;sex part&quot; does not <i>have to</i> get in the way.  In most cases the sex part is very superficial, it&#x27;s just an idea that comes naturally to peoples minds and it&#x27;s simply not a big deal at all.  People, men and women, think about sex (almost all the time, both sexes) and worthless semi random thoughts about sex with <i>almost any</i> person will be had.  It simply is not such a big deal.  The funny thing is that we are all aware of the universality and banality of these thoughts, yet act as though it&#x27;s something special, extraordinary and serious.  Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not advocating promiscuity (although, again to be clear, I have no moral issue with that as long as it&#x27;s honest), but simply putting the whole thing to rest, it&#x27;s not even worth talking about.<p>And it better not be true that sex stands in the way of friendship because long, commited, beautiful relationships sure  involve a lot of sex and deep friendship.  Sex can only stand in the way of friendship if all one wants is sex.",1398268762

If your code is written to be testable you <i>usually</i> can avoid mocks.<p>That being said, if you are writing a test on an algorithm and the data comes from a database this means you are not just writing a test on the algorithm - you are writing a test on the database with all the cruft that comes along with that.  This test can be hundreds of times slower due to the DB dependency.<p>So mocks do have their place.  The test pyramid is the answer - you need units (sometimes with mocks, integration, system).<p>In my experience most companies are way too integration heavy and very light on the unit side of things.  For example for my current project our dev tests take 12 hours to run.  This is the result of going too far away from the unit level and being too integration heavy.<p>There is a balance!  Sounds like the rails world the balance is too unit heavy.  In the enterprise world I think it&#x27;s too integration/system heavy.",1398268648

Part of this will involve building out a co-employment legal structure to create a fluid labor network that will effectively allow agency member-owners to &quot;insource&quot; employee time from their peers on an ad hoc basis. Eventually we want to white label our solutions and make them open source so that any nonprofit sector in any city can use them, but for now we are focusing on a the arts sector in NYC. It&#x27;s all very preliminary and we are really wrestling with a fear of new ideas that is endemic in nonprofit culture, but we are taking a lot of inspiration from what is going on in the tech sector (where problems are things to be solved and not monsters under the bed).

(The only other one I know is RPi. Thanks for nothing Ouya.)<p>* The extra CPU and RAM is fantastic. The little guy flies along. I was happily compiling things on it at quite reasonable speeds.<p>* The eMMC option is pretty cool, but be careful because their MicroSD adapter is pretty finicky (it wouldn&#x27;t work on my Macbook, did work on my Mac Mini running Linux)<p>* It has a terribly annoying blinking blue light that can&#x27;t be turned off and is brighter than the sun. I put some tape over it and felt briefly like macgyver.<p>* Nothing except for XBMC supports hardware video decoding. That means if you want to use VLC or something, too bad (for now anyway).<p>* Android on it was just about useless, but it&#x27;s neat to have it as an option.<p>* There are a bunch of proprietary blobs and versions of things that need to be installed on the device for it to work. In practice, this isn&#x27;t really a problem because this is all done for you in the stock image.<p>* XBMC was still pretty laggy on Ubuntu, and couldn&#x27;t play video without skipping. Apparently it&#x27;s better on Debian. Nobody seems to understand why this is. Apparently it&#x27;s blazing fast on Android.<p>* The devs are insanely active, both in pushing code and on the forums. I say devs, I think it&#x27;s one guy who never sleeps.<p>All told, I&#x27;m currently not using it for XBMC (holding out for the Ubuntu situation being fixed), but I am running other stuff on it that was taxing the memory and CPU of my Pi, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with that.

Quoting from the paper, 4 paragraphs after the 2km/s you referenced:<p>> Probably the most signi\fcant feature of the flow in the concept reactor is that it involves a compressible liquid. With flow velocities exceeding 2 km/s and pressures reaching 400 GPa, compressibility is unavoidable.<p>&quot;Flow&quot; refers to the spin speed, not the collapse.<p>Like I said earlier, I used the equation for a liquid mirror telescope -- h = 1/(2g) * (omega * r) ^ 2 -- for my &#x27;&quot;back of the envelope&quot; thing.&#x27; See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_mirror_telescope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_mirror_telescope</a> for the full derivation.<p>Using h = 2.7 m, g = 9.8m/s, and r = 0.20m gives 40 Hz (or 2,400 rpm). Note though that this gives 20 cm at the <i>top</i>, and 0cm at the bottom. It&#x27;s a paraboloid, so the center is probably 14-15 cm across. Thus, 40 Hz is a lower bound.<p>Using 40 Hz in (2 * pi * 1.5m) * 40/s implies a minimum equatorial speed of 380m/s, which is Mach 1. The equatorial pumps of course must be providing fluid at an even higher speed. The g-forces at the equator, 1.5 meters away, are even larger than the g-forces at the surface 20 cm away. a = r * omega^2 = 1.5m * 1600/s/s = 2500 G.<p>To get a more uniform evacuated center requires higher speeds still, but the formula I used (first discovered by Newton, btw), no longer holds. It will likely need to be several times faster. Flow speeds of 2km/s require only 6 times faster than the minimum possible speed, which sounds reasonable. Even if 2km/s doesn&#x27;t sound reasonable.<p>I don&#x27;t think General Fusion has done the engineering testing to show that they can actually construct one of these, much less use it to provide power.<p>Feel free to correct my calculations.",1398266441

When I started working on a binary tree space-partitioning algorithm a while ago for my talk at Pycon 2014 I started just writing code and spent a precious couple of nights banging my head against the wall because it was always off and would come up with intermittent errors. I had figured that I knew the data-structure and algorithm well enough and this is one-off code so who cares? So when I was desperate I had told a couple of good friends about my problem and they reminded me: I hadn&#x27;t written the tests figuring that I&#x27;d save myself the time.<p>TDD has just been a part of my process for years now that I don&#x27;t think I can even write good code without it. Even in statically type-checked languages. The practice forces me to specify the contracts and behaviors of each piece of my code before I write a single line to implement it. That loop of test, write, pass/fail offloads a tonne of complexity from my mind. It also helps me to discover where my assumptions were wrong in the design process when I notice some tests require too many mocks/stubs/assumptions about state or are simply brittle.

But somewhere else, specifically GOOS[0], the TDD cycle always starts with an end to end test, with an inner unit test/development cycle to get the test passing. I think this is really important, because if you don&#x27;t have end to end tests, it&#x27;s a lot harder to refactor your code in significant ways, and can leave you with extra work maintaining all of your unit tests.<p>Another thing is &quot;fast tests&quot; as resulting in &quot;a dense jungle&quot; of objects. At least in GOOS, the assertion is that a larger network of small objects is better than a smaller network of large objects. I&#x27;m not going to argue the benefits of one way or another, but what I mean to point out is that (at least some) people use TDD because they think it will help them write a more maintainable code base, and aren&#x27;t just writing code to make their tests fast for the sake of fast tests.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/</a>",1398266197

And you probably understand this, but still. Dynamic languages allow fundamentally unsound types, for example:<p><pre><code>    def foo(x):\n        print x\n        return foo\n</code></pre>\nThis function has no computable type (in a standard system anyway); it&#x27;s &quot;a -> a -> a -> ...&quot;. However it&#x27;s perfectly obvious what it does, and conceivable that it or similar functions might exist and be useful in actual code.

The fact that they had that tourist drink in their menu doesn&#x27;t change that it&#x27;s both unreasonable and unexpected, and according to mastercard/visa agreements chargebacks may be possible.<p>In general, the credit card companies are motivated to protect cardholders, so their agreements with merchants sometimes put stricter conditions than local consumer right legislation - the merchant can either alter their behavior; or pay chargebacks; or not accept those creditcards.",1398265764

For example, if you have a date-to-readable-string conversion library, you can test the crap out of it since it&#x27;s input is a date object and its output is a string. It&#x27;s a unit of code, so all the testing that&#x27;s required is unit testing.<p>On the other hand, when the &quot;unit&quot; you are testing relies on six external API&#x27;s and your own database to work, best of luck to ya. It&#x27;s not a unit at this point, it&#x27;s the glue that holds other units together. It is important to get it right, but given how many different combinations of failure modes there are you are not going to test it all and you are not going to get it right. Mocks/fakes do not make this stuff much better as timing and latency are important too. What if the UPS address service you are using doesn&#x27;t return an error but times out? Now your production code has to include enough of a framework for simulating network errors.<p>I do agree with TFA: TDD is a niche thing that has been so widely embraced for all the wrong reasons that it&#x27;s no longer useful even in the niche. Also, system-wide testing is very important as well and the tooling for it sucks. My rule of thumb is to be pragmatic about automated testing: test the things that will give you the greatest ROI in terms of time/effort/time-to-market/etc. but don&#x27;t be religious about it.

If I&#x27;m doing test-after, I already think the code works, so it&#x27;s harder for me to notice the places where my thinking is wrong. If I&#x27;m doing test-first, I start out more skeptical and clear-headed.<p>I also think I design better, and for similar reasons. TDD starts me focused on the how the code appears from the outside, and then I make the implementation conform to that. If I start with the implementation, it&#x27;s easier for me to get a little slack about the API; because my head is full with how it works internally, more of that can end up in the external interface.",1398265419

In college, I tried my hand at policy debate, and found it wearisome.  The research was enjoyable, but the motormouth spewing of undigested (and indigestible at that speed) facts seemed pointless.  It was also less fun to watch others.  So that lasted through two tournaments, then it was back to the computer lab...",1310255811

I interviewed with this rinky dink company in, what was then, HQ'ed in Bellevue WA (now they are in Redmond), to work on their top secret ""windows"" project. Wow, what a POS that thing was at the time. They offered me $10K/yr less than what I was making at the time and this fantastic stock option plan. But hey; all they had going for them at the time was DOS and this crappy windows where the windows could not overlap, wow. They did not stand a chance against Apple who was way ahead of them with the Mac. So I turned them down. That was the smart move on my part?  OK, so the moral of the story is this, take chance when you are young, go for it, do what excites you. So what if you fail. Try it, do it, go for it. Do NOT stick with the cushy salary.",1310255712

I would ascribe some of it to random chance, not in the ""Anyone can do it,"" sense so much as the ""We will not likely appear in the <i>Times</i> or similar sources on a monthly basis in the future,"" sense.<p>I wouldn't characterize us as the go-to source, by any means. We've gotten some good press, but there are lot of companies that get quoted on this kind of issue. That said, my cofounder and I have been cited by the NYT twice each, in under a year, so we're getting something right.<p>Here is what I would advise: find a way that you can provide uniquely useful data to journalists. Only contact them when you have something useful to say. It's okay to fact-check people, as long as you frame it more as ""Here's an insider's view,"" not ""Here's why this person is wrong."" (And, within their paradigm, journalists are rarely wrong--but it's often possible for them to do a follow-up piece that discusses things from another angle. That's where the industry experts come in.)<p>I also have to point out that Digital DD is in the unique position of evaluating companies as our business model. Our job is to have an opinion, so it's natural that if a journalist wants to talk to someone with an opinion about a related issue, they'll reach out to us. You can't count on this if you're not in the business of researching and analyzing other people's behavior.",1310255164

Because the Chinese government isn't beholden to a two year election cycle they're able to think over a much longer term horizon. Whether this is good/bad in the long term remains to be seen, as a more dynamic business environment might threaten their long term vision.<p>64 million surplus homes in China could be filled in a heartbeat. China is not America where everyone for the most part already has a pretty decent home. The current US estimates are similar per capita, but the issue is that US doesn't have a massive supply of peasant farmers who would like much better houses in the city.<p>China has started to reach the point where it is fueling the demand for it's own goods similar to what happened to the US in the 20s and continued in the 50s and 60s as a generation moved from the farm to the city. In the US the fuel was lend/lease and marshall aid, for China it's trinkets for Wal-Mart.<p>At 100,000 USD a pop the surplus represents 6.4 trillion dollars, if you assume the units are overvalued similar to USD real estate meaning they have a 3.2 trillion dollar bubble. A 3.2 trillion dollar bubble is similar to the costs of the US bubble plus a war in Iraq and Afganistan. The only difference is the Chinese have peasants who will ostensibly drastically increase their economic output and the fact that building modest housing probably has a better ROI than war.",1310253532

How do you teach it? Only young people tend to be fluent. Most English teachers have never left the country, or had much one-on-one interaction with people who can speak good English. Students are great at certain elements of formal written grammar, if it's in an exam setting. Vocabulary can be OK. But fluency can be a problem.<p>2) Red tape. It's non-existant for the old woman selling wonton soup by the side of the street (as long as she can run faster than the local city management, or can afford to give them lots of free soup), but not likely to be fun for foreign businesses.<p>3) Talent. I'm sure it's there, but you won't know how to find it. You can't tell if people are bright, unless you can communicated easily. Also,expect programmers with great geometry, good algorithms, and no idea how to work in a team; kinda like most countries, really.<p>4) Honesty.

2746549,comment,2746426,2746426,3,0,jackpirate,,,"I too have considered how church specific software could be made better.<p>My old church uses a program called The City (<a href=""http://www.onthecity.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onthecity.org/</a>) to create a social presence for themselves.  This was a nondenominational church in Southern California that had ~1000 people/week split into 3 services.<p>In general, I think the implementation of this idea was awful.  Younger people are already on facebook/twitter/etc and don't need another account to maintain.  Older people have a hard time getting on it and using it, although I think it does help older members of the church keep in touch with each other.  This church has had a hard time getting people to sign up and use it regularly despite the pastor mentioning it every week for months in the service and bringing in outside tech support people to train the congregation.<p>I see two major problems with church software.  First, drawing the line at what exactly is a church.  I know many Baptist congregations that would be offended at the thought of using the same software as an Episcopalian parish, nevermind Catholic/Jewish/Muslim/New Age Hippie.  The needs of a small Baptist congregation and a small Catholic one are going to be much more similar, however, than a small Baptist church and a mega church.<p>The second problem is how to handle accepting money.  It feels wrong to develop church software with a profit motive, rather than a make the church more Christ-like motive.  (I've always wondered about the companies that make the Eucharist crackers and all the other church paraphernalia.)  I think the best solution would be to offer the software at-cost (whatever that means for software... hosting fees maybe?) to churches, and then have a recommended donation above that amount.<p>One of the biggest problems I have with the tech-culture of the church is the lack of open source.  I think that OSS nearly perfectly aligns with Jesus's ideals, and it is frustrating when religious people don't see that.  A service that brought Linux awareness to more churches would be amazing.<p>I'd love to chat more about this issue.  What type of church do you attend?  Are you ordained or have you been employed at churches?",1310253178

I don't think you're giving competitive policy debate a fair treatment here.<p>On the surface it seems stupid to think that an un-refuted argument should be considered true. But arguments are evaluated that way in policy debates for a very specific reason -- the purpose of debate is not to discover the truth, it is to win an argument. That's the whole point of the activity. If you don't like it, you don't have to play.<p>That's actually the reason I quit during my sophomore year, but it doesn't make debate a worthless activity. Nothing taught me to work harder or think faster.<p>Debate is like working out. It's not real, so certain considerations go out the window. Under your logic, running on a treadmill is a bad idea because you're not actually going anywhere. But the point of debate isn't to discover the truth, it's to sharpen your understanding and wit.<p>Where debate goes wrong is when you stay in it too long. After a certain point the skills become harder and harder to transfer to other parts of your life. And a lot of the people in it, as you might be able to imagine, are pretty arrogant know-it-alls.<p>After I left debate, I had to re-socialize myself back into the world of normal people who don't argue with each other all day for fun. It sounds like I'm exaggerating, but all my friends were debaters and all my time was spent researching, debating, or arguing with them about literally everything.

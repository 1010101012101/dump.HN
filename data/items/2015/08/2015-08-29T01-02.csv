A meme is an arbitrary unit of culture in the same way a gene is an arbitrary unit of genetic material.  Both, the theory goes, are equal parts of the process of evolution.  Memes are inherited and go through the same processes of evolution.<p>You&#x27;re right, they aren&#x27;t arbitrary or random, they&#x27;re evolved.

Unix security concepts are built into the system architecture whereas in Windows they are implemented as features on top of the OS. A perfect example that he calls out, ACL. Some does exist in the architecture of Windows, but it is only a half hearted implementation.<p>Modularity is another example of something that is fundamental both in the architecture AND the philosophy of Unix, but very far behind in Windows where many applications such as a browser exploit can tie into the kernel space.<p>The communities and philosophies are also something I breezed over, but I think they are a non-trivial part of an operating system.",1440813429

[Almost] no elevator has ever fallen due to a snapped cable, in the history of elevators.  (So even if you&#x27;re afraid of heights you have no reason to be afraid of elevators, but maybe stop reading this comment here in this case.)<p>This is why even highly sqeamish people or people afraid of heights don&#x27;t mind standing in a locked elevator cab, being held up by a cable, and with ten, twenty, fifty or a hundred stories of empty space under them while the cable lifts them up and down.  It&#x27;s just a non-issue (due to height, I guess claustrophobia is a separate issue.)<p>And this happens because the safety mechanism to keep elevators from falling is, well, perfect.  The inventor of the elevator showed it, again and again, using his life.<p>If it weren&#x27;t the case, at least some people would feel very differently about elevators!  As this case shows, a standard of &quot;perfect or nothing&quot; absolutely impacts public perception and fast adoption, and may even mold people&#x27;s opinion for centuries to come.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Otis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Otis</a><p>[2] I had done a quick Internet search, see replies for a few cases.",1440812641

Clojure hasn&#x27;t got low-level interop with all those things, just JVM, and that interop is bought at the cost of closely tying Clojure to JVM. I don&#x27;t think D can be changed in all the basic ways that would be required to give it the same level of integration with JVM, and that would also basically mean abandoning the entire standard library.

10138588,comment,10130203,10134337,0,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> The Everett FAQ Q16 disagrees.</i><p>It looks to me like it &quot;disagrees&quot; mostly by mis-stating what other interpretations predict about the (highly idealized) thought experiments it describes. For example, it says that if we had a &quot;reversible machine intelligence&quot;, we could use it to entirely reverse a measurement after it was performed. But on a collapse interpretation (such as Copenhagen), such a &quot;reversible&quot; measurement, like any reversible process, is not a measurement at all; it doesn&#x27;t collapse the wave function. So the interpretations don&#x27;t actually differ on this prediction; they just differ on how the result (which they both agree on) is interpreted.<p>The FAQ does raise one issue which might amount to a &quot;difference in prediction&quot;, namely the issue of whether linearity is exact or not. The MWI requires that it is; any collapse interpretation requires that it is not. However, even here there is a problem about what constitutes a &quot;prediction&quot;. The MWI claims that the other &quot;worlds&quot; exist, but we can&#x27;t communicate with them; we can only detect them via interference effects, which basically means by keeping processes reversible, as above, so a collapse interpretation will just say that no collapse has occurred. But that is effectively the same as the collapse interpretation&#x27;s prediction that the other worlds don&#x27;t exist after a collapse has occurred. In other words, these two putatively different &quot;predictions&quot; are in fact experimentally indistinguishable.",1440810348

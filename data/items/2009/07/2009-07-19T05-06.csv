712647,comment,711818,711863,0,0,kragen,,,"We could build some kind of a computer network that allows people to send their classified ads to each other directly for tiny fractions of a penny, sucking away the reveneues of the newspapers. Then people could trade videos directly over the network, so they don't watch TV. When there's a natural disaster or terrorist attack, people can use this network to publish their photos and firsthand reports in minutes, and then other people using the network will pick which photos and reports are worth forwarding on. Then people won't pay any attention to TV news. Then we just need to figure out how to make it possible to publish things like the Pentagon Papers right away, before the government has the chance to suppress them. Also, we need people to use the network to spread celebrity gossip. Then the big TV news corporations will lose their air supply.<p>Do you think that might work?",1247981893

If you've got test servers or a render/compile farm or something to test your work on, then obviously you only need a machine that can support your editor, server access and lookup needs. On the other hand, if you're limited to one machine and you're doing complex work, you're going to need something more powerful, laptop or desktop. The question then becomes how much more you're willing to pay for the extra portability of a laptop, especially when it's a heavy desktop replacement.",1247981783

Math was never my ""strong suit"",  but over the last year I've really grown to enjoy it as I learn more.  I've taken Calc. I in a fairly demanding college environment, and am planning on continuing with Calc. II and Linear Algebra.<p>My question to HN is: How does one go about doing self-study in Math?  It seems, of all the sciences, to be especially  difficult to tackle without the built-in support of the classroom.  I assume that like most things, it just takes a lot of hard work and study, but I'm curious if anyone out there has a rough plan for tackling a reasonably rich understanding of mathematics on their own.  Sites, materials, etc. are appreciated.<p>Thanks!",1247981554

The last thing Amazon wants to do is to remind people that a Kindle is not a tool for reading books that you own. It's best viewed as a tool for <i>renting</i> books for an indefinite period.<p>(I actually like the Kindle, and am still thinking of getting one someday, but I have no confidence that a DRM-protected Kindle book will outlive the hardware it lives on. To me, the Kindle would merely be a way to streamline the process of buying a book, reading it, and then selling it again. If I want to <i>keep</i> a book I'll stick with the paper version.)<p>The problem is that rental has lower profit margins. People's mental model of book rental is based on the library, where the apparent price is ""free"". A Kindle book's big profit margin is dependent on the illusion that buying the book actually <i>makes you the owner of the book</i> and that it will behave as real books do.<p>And, of course, there's no tradition of people banning cars they don't like, then having the police drag those cars away. But there is a long tradition of book-banning and book-burning that Amazon is unwise to evoke.<p>I'm a little bit hopeful that this debacle will help accelerate the decline of ebook prices.<p>---<p>[1] If you define current copyright law, which effectively ensures that everything invented after Mickey Mouse will remain under copyright forever, as ""justice"".",1247981170

If this gets popular, though, there's no question it will be shut down, if not by the RIAA then by YouTube itself.<p>My feedback: needs more AJAX.  Clicking items in the interface like ""friends"" or ""music"" shouldn't reload the page and stop the playing song.  Also, get rid of modal dialogs.  (For example, when adding a song or playlist, give it a default name instead of asking for a name in a modal dialog.)  Also, don't ask for my real name up front; wait until later.",1247980937

That saying, of course, is meant to be a joke.  The US can't just do it's own laundry to survive.  We can't just sell latte's to each other, either.  We have to actually produce more than we consume.<p>So, we either have to produce a lot more, or consume a lot less.  I don't see us producing more, do you?<p>I used to comfort myself that we had evolved as a nation, from doers into investors, and that we still brought value to the world by providing the capital needed for the rest of the world to grow, and so we were indeed, earning our bread.

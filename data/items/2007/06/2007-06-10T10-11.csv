Spam is no longer contained to the SMTP protocol.  I get spam on my blog, in our forums, and in our wikis.  I'm sure it's going to be a problem in messaging, if it isn't already.<p>And, many startups are dealing with email.  It isn't what we advertise as an important part of our product, and yet we spend vast amounts of developer time worrying about it, 90% of it related to spam.  If I hadn't already heard Paul's comments about this at a YC dinner, it would have been welcome advice (and the link to Taylor's ""Sender Reputation..."" article was very useful).

One could literally grab something that has been proven to work well in the U.S. and do it there, making a lot of money in the process. Now that is the theory and I'm aware of increased risk of running business in Russia. However, it is definitely worth thinking about.",1284346797

The reality is that ""the mob"" runs the gamut from petty thugs to sophisticated criminal corporate raiders.<p>The root of the issue is whether Russia's criminal tactics for corporate raiding apply to software startups. One can take over physical means of productions, but the same is close to impossible to do with software.<p>Arguably the most important factor stopping growth of startups in Russia is personal safety. Founders do startups to get rich. However in Russia financial success brings unwanted attention to founders. There are plenty of thugs salivating at an opportunity to go after a newly minted millionaire.<p>Most startup incubators in US & Europe offer help with networking, business & investment mentoring. Perhaps incubators in Russia need to help founders with personal security services.",1284346748

1685292,comment,1683765,1683765,0,0,wglb,,,"So here is one data point.  I was very interested in electronics as a kid, and got a ham radio license at a very young age.  I studied everything about radio that I could get my hands on, Fourier analysis, circuit design, propagation.  I ended up at Northwestern (by some mechanism that is still not clear to me) in the EE program and took the 5 year (with co-op) program.  I had studied enough that it wasn't until Control System Theory that I learned something totally new to me.<p>Meanwhile, in my freshman year, I got into computer programming and haven't looked back and have been making a living programming for all the decades since.  I did finish my engineering degree, but during my senior year I was working pretty much full-time in my first startup.<p>So what I would say worked for me is the studying that I did outside of my actual coursework.  This has continued to be my habit after college as well.  While I was officially studying EE, I was learning everything I could about computers.  While I was writing real-time data acquisition and pattern analysis software for that startup, I was studying how to build compilers.  Then, once I started building compilers for a living, I started doing consulting.<p>So I am not a good data point for a connection between what school was about and what the career is about.  But then again, the career has had a number of shifts in which  study of a new field was key.<p>So while you are considering this decision, consider 1) how well you do is more a function of you than which, if any, school you go to and 2) you will learn things in a university (and college) that will serve you well later on 3) you might be the kind of person who can do well without school.<p>And to this day I am a bit ambivalent about CS degrees.  My own narrow experience makes me suggest a good engineering program with a CS minor.  I do wonder if one learns programming without gaining a few scars and adopting one dogma and another and have that go bad on you.<p>To give an example, I was once in a position to interview candidates for compiler positions.  There were some schools whose CS masters grads were frightened of compilers, others who had a good grasp.<p>However, if you have done a ""few apps"" and consider yourself a Badass Developer, perhaps a good school will help you with that notion.  I am reminded of stories I heard about folk going to places such as Cal Tech.  Supposedly there was a week spent convincing all these very smart kids that they were not all that much more badass than the kids to their left or right.",1284345495

It's a libertarian constituency given to see life as a succession of fairly hermetic, individual choices and more readily given to accept that the economic game is a fundamentally functional, if imperfect meritocracy.<p>It would undermine a great deal of the narrative of this whole startup scene mythos into which we are all supposed to be buying here to draw vast attention to examples like the self-perpetuating character of poverty (as a generalisation, not an exception-less rule), and with it, insinuations about the economic privilege commanded by American corporate entities to export <i>de facto</i> Internet-defining cultural impositions or expectations along with their products.  The American capitalistic success story told to children here is dispositionally arrayed against allegations of a very close interplay between ""politics"" and ""naked economics,"" for some reason.  Plus, you're going to run up against the seeming consensus that to the degree that identifiably American values are actually ""imposed"" this way, far better those, with their historical indebtedness to Anglo-American liberal intellectual heritage and democratic ideas and whatnot, than, oh, some other cultures we could name.<p>Anyway, it seems to me that fixating upon the issue of boobs or nudity on Facebook per se is missing the point.  We can argue about the degree to which it is <i>truly</i> ""oppressive,"" and pull Godwins by alluding to the experiences of German Jews in the 1930s all we want, but they're all ""angels on the head of a pin"" type sophistry.

You have to, because you're going to need exclusions from your IP contract.<p>If your prospective employer is an established company, you should also be aware that --- right or wrong, frivolous or not --- the mere filing of a lawsuit against you down the road stands a good chance of killing your startup. Lawsuits are spectacularly expensive, and they take <i>f o  r   e    v    e    r</i>.<p>Even 1099 contractors --- people that aren't even technically employees! --- can fall ass-backwards into situations where clients end up with legal influence over personal projects (this is why you need your NDA's and ""standard contracting agreements"" reviewed by an attorney). This isn't an area to mess around in.<p>You may be thinking that this is low risk, but this is a great example of common pattern of deceptively terrible risk: the kind that only matters if your startup ends up mattering.",1284343374

Really?<p>If we were being poetic, here, then I'd say that Man's greatest enemy is Man themselves, but this is HN, so I won't. For a runner up, I would at least choose an animal that can actually kill a healthy human, rather than one that and annoy a healthy human and kill a subset with allergic reactions of venom.<p>2.) There are a lot of species of wasp. According to wikipedia, 160,000. Not all of them will sting, or even <i>can</i> sting humans. Fig wasps count among them. There are quite a few wasps that are beneficial, in that they predate upon insects that are slightly more annoying than the wasps themselves.<p>3.) Nectar is produced (generally) by flowers, to attract pollinators. By design, it's easily accessible by insects, and not protected by the rind of a fruit. The juice of a fruit is just juice, not nectar.",1284343277

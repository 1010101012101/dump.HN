There is a history of humans screwing ourselves up in the name of progress(mercury & lead poisoning,asbestos & iridium usage, even sand in bread in ancient Egypt)<p>Can we shy away from these advancements in the name of safety? No-that is not how progress is made. What the critical point is that we should be more careful in vetting how we as society do/deal with things without the influence of money or power. This maybe a far-fetched utopia delusion but the only thing that will keep us from wiping ourselves out as a species. The world is getting smaller and the actions of a few are affecting more and more everyday.<p>Heck, ask a AWS engineer to go pull a plug somewhere. Watch the tech world burn.",1426687173

9225455,comment,9224858,9225223,0,0,Thriptic,,,"> If you&#x27;re living within a corrupt, self-serving political system (we are), then naturally the only people who run for office will be products of that system.  If a candidate who genuinely wants to change the status quo somehow manages to slip in, they will be prevented from achieving anything meaningful once inside.<p>If these politicians are as corrupt and self-serving as you say, then it actually becomes quite easy to enact meaningful change. All we need to do is coalesce around important issues and threaten to vote politicians out of office if they don&#x27;t bend to our will. Schwartz himself was one of the individuals who rallied broad segments of the population to mobilize and defeat the passage of the deeply unpopular, industry backed legislation that was SOPA by implicitly threatening to punish politicians who voted in favor of it.<p>I think people assume that because their vote doesn&#x27;t cout, their voice doesn&#x27;t count. Even if you don&#x27;t vote you can still donate money to opposing political causes (or threaten to), write your congressmen, protest, rally public support, and call out your elected officials publicly. If enough people do this it is possible to elicit change without stepping foot inside a voting booth.",1426687017

9225450,comment,9222720,9225383,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;This is interesting, but I guess I&#x27;m wondering how it really differs to buying a brand new car. The moment you drive it outside the car dealer you&#x27;ve lost money.&quot;<p>A: Nowhere <i>near</i> as much, and B: That&#x27;s what I was referring to with the &quot;vendor guarantee&quot;... the reason <i>why</i> your car loses its value when you drive it off the lot is obviously not that the car changes meaningfully, but that in the somewhat scammy world of used cars you will not be able to establish to anyone that your car really <i>is</i> brand new anymore, so you take a hit based on the fact that you do not have a reputation that says &quot;I am $CAR Dealership XYZ and I stake my name on the fact this really is a brand new $CAR straight from the factory&quot;.<p>(Incidentally, to some extent, note that when people suggest that the solution is to always buy used, they often aren&#x27;t taking that into account properly in their zeal to make their point. You&#x27;re paying less <i>precisely</i> because the odds of you being scammed just went up. If you are, for instance, someone very likely to be able to detect scams, by all means, go collect your &quot;knowledge premium&quot; from the market and buy used. But if you are not such a person, think twice. I don&#x27;t mean &quot;never do it&quot;... I just mean, think twice. I have family that was taken for a ride by buying used when they &quot;couldn&#x27;t afford&quot; new... well, it turns out they couldn&#x27;t afford &quot;scammy used&quot; either....)<p>Yes, that is one solution to the conundrum, buy at <i>actual</i> market value. In the longterm that&#x27;s an unstable solution... if rings lose their signaling value entirely (see other comments), then the eventual stable solution is not to buy them at all. However, in the meantime, what the eventual stable solution 50 years from now will be isn&#x27;t actionable today, so by all means buy something that impresses your friends and pocket the difference. My wife and I went a different route and bought a nice ring with two Tanzenite stones in it for, IIRC, on the order of $250 1999-dollars, and I still think it looks pretty nice. Tanzenite is a bit soft but we&#x27;ve had no problems, and I think it&#x27;s beautiful but the jewelry community seems to think it isn&#x27;t worth much. We were happy to come to arrangements with them on that matter. This is another way to hack the process, since people aren&#x27;t consciously thinking all the way through this it can suffice to present a token <i>similar</i> to a &quot;diamond ring&quot; but that did not require the useless investment.",1426686979

1. SimCity 4 with the statistical simulation model, big maps (region-wise) and plenty of features. 
2. SimCity 5 with a pure agent-based simulation model (it had flaws though, especially traffic), but again the series pioneered a new way of creating games in this genre. And,
3. Cities XL having a HUGE map, few unique features like bus routing, etc and amazing graphics!<p>All these games had flaws in their respective models but worked well nonetheless. SimCity 5 is a success IMO; for venturing into a much realistic simulation that you could connect with.

But it&#x27;s not without faults. For me one of the telling things will be how they handle a very similar problem that EA had with the latest Sim City. Traffic. Once your city becomes a certain size the game goes from City Builder to Traffic Management Simulator. Which itself wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if not for issues with the simulation.<p>For example if you have a 6-lane, one-way, road with intersections cars will get into the right/left lanes as soon as they get on the road, even if that&#x27;s on the other side of the map from where they&#x27;re turning. Causing the middle lanes to become useless and the others to be backed up (admittedly this isn&#x27;t totally unrealistic though). I remember Sim City had similar problems and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a tough one to solve. Especially on a big game world with hundreds, or thousands, of intersections and tens of thousands of cars being simulated at once. Even if they don&#x27;t solve it I&#x27;ll still be burning my weekends on this game for a long time.",1426686088

I can also give an example (stolen from a talk) directly involving shared_ptr even when used with traditional &quot;best practices&quot; although I&#x27;m sure the best practices will update themselves to include this.<p>In some sense, Rust has been described as merely formalizing and automatically enforcing the best practices that people were already using in C++; it&#x27;s the formality and automaticity that turns it from a dangerous language to a safe one.",1426685996

So that when two people are making small talk, one can say &quot;Did you see what happened with Hilary Clinton/LeBron James/Kanye West?&quot; It&#x27;s pointless, but pointless communication has a role as a social lubricant. It lets people build up to weightier topics, or just politely pass the time together. And common knowledge of news subjects is a part of that system.<p>Ultimately, news is a form of entertainment. Now more than ever. People don&#x27;t watch Fox News or MSNBC to be more informed voters or to take personal action. Many of them want to hear what Personality X has to say about Event Y.

9225264,comment,9224858,9225122,0,0,grey-area,,,"I think the problem with news is that it is has become driven by the imperatives of Google (a company which makes money from advertising). Those imperatives lead inexorably to a thirst for page-views and page-rank, and horrible sites like buzzfeed. I&#x27;ve noticed this evolution in previously respected publications like The Guardian or The Independent in the UK (much Guardian coverage nowadays is centred on clicks, as are initiatives like the i-100).<p>Here are some tenets to which I think any news company aspiring to change the field and report news responsibly should think about:<p>Popularity is poisonous and the enemy of the good - what is good or even factually right is often not popular<p>Context is key - without context, a fact can be meaningless or actively misleading (e.g. the most liberal senator in the senate, 45 minutes from a chemical war from the dodgy dossier).<p>On the ground observation is key - this is something modern tech has changed in a very positive way, though it does also allow for rumours and misinformation.<p>Analysis is key - without analysis from informed observers, lots of news is hard to digest and understand - it provides context<p>Balance is an illusion - Opinions <i>always</i> colour analysis and the facts reported, we should be up-front about this - every org and person has them.<p>Fact checking with primary sources is key - how can you possibly fact-check factoids that your readers are constantly upvoting? How can you possibly fact check an opinion?<p>National news is often horribly biased, and national newspapers usually pander to the government/demographic they serve, especially in time of war.<p>Most public outrage is wrong or at least ill-founded - we have representative and informed democracy to try to avoid the rule of the mob.<p>Quick news is the antithesis of thoughtful, incisive news<p>There&#x27;s plenty of buzzfeed-esque junk out there trying to recycle news and readers as quickly as possible, and it is neither viable in the long term nor is it good for news or for readers. So I disagree completely (as does the article I think) on what you consider to be a good news publication.<p>PS Your website doesn&#x27;t even show me what it does before it asks for email, you might want to consider changing that.

But, it seems odd to me that almost all of the focus in lock free queues are unbounded linked-list based implementations.<p>Unbounded size is usually undesirable in production systems. It&#x27;s a fine property to have sometimes, but I would always default to a bounded queue. When a consumer is overwhelmed the producer must experience push-back.<p>Linked lists produce prodigious garbage. If you really are pushing the performance shown here, 10 million per second, that is a lot of garbage to collect, even if it all dies in Eden space.<p>Linked list based implementations are extremely complex. My first lock-free queue implementation was based on Java&#x27;s ConcurrentLinkedQueue. It was a monumental headache, and I didn&#x27;t quite complete it. Compare that to a (admittedly single-consumer,single-producer) array based queue and the explanation is fairly straightforward, by comparison. You can extend the single-consumer, single-producer to multi/multi fairly easily and still be able to explain how it works to most programmers. (all written in Go)<p>I am sort of confused by the amount of attention these complex linked-list based queues get in the write-ups. If the intention is to introduce lock-free techniques and concepts then I think the array based queues are much better. If you want the best performance with low garbage and predictable latency I would expect arrays to win almost always. Very happy to be proved wrong here.<p>The best collection of write-ups on lock-free array backed queues is here<p><a href=""http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.uk/p/lock-free-queues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.uk/p/lock-free-queues.html</a><p>My code to back it up :)<p>The queues I have built are based on work by Martin Thomson (of disruptor fame)<p><a href=""https://github.com/fmstephe/flib/tree/master/queues/spscq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fmstephe/flib/tree/master/queues/spscq</a>",1426684906

Studied for the test, not for the concepts.<p>We all weren&#x27;t learning anything useful. It was basic rote memorization, no concepts, no nothing.

But it don&#x27;t matter, as long as you recognized the unfamiliar words and memorized dictionary definitions... and then practiced analogies for 2 to 3 months at a time... you will get it.<p>We learned how the SAT was graded, how to pick out easy questions. How to skip the harder questions that mattered less for your score... and focus your mind (while it was still fresh) on the more important questions. We even learned patterns to hypothesize which of the sections wasn&#x27;t gonna be graded. (one section of the SAT is not graded. It is a baseline for next-year&#x27;s SAT)<p>After the SAT, most of us forgot the meanings of those words.

If parenting books unanimously decided that formula was bad, then parents who cared enough about their children to read them and follow their advice would be more likely to breastfeed and you would see a positive correlation with IQ, even if formula was completely equivalent to breastfeeding.<p>So while there is a clear correlation after controlling for demographic, there is not necessarily a causation. My formulation really wasn&#x27;t meant to imply causation, but rather the handling of unknown data (I grouped unknown-status children together with breastfed children). When talking about correlation, it&#x27;s not meaningful to make a distinction between IQ impairment and IQ gain.",1426684333

With a powerful type system you effectively eliminate certain problems from happening, like I once had a bug that I couldn&#x27;t understand, yet I eliminated the possibility of it happening. And I prefer it precisely because I&#x27;m not smart enough for the problems I&#x27;m working on, so I prefer having a static type-system holding my hand.<p>That said ...<p>> <i>On the other hand I can get by with writing Haskell and OCaml without writing tests</i><p>Tests and static type-safety serve different purposes. If you end up writing tests for properties that should have been inferred by a static compiler, then you&#x27;re using the language in a wrong way or you&#x27;ve picked the wrong language for the problem at hand.<p>When working with a dynamic language, I don&#x27;t need to write tests just to see that my code works. It&#x27;s because I work with a REPL and in terms of happy paths, that&#x27;s just as effective as having a static type system.<p>And surely having a compiler is very cool when refactoring, however we tend to miss the fact that (a) the kind of refactorings we are doing are very superficial and for architectural / design refactorings the compiler doesn&#x27;t save you and (b) in a dynamic language there is less need for refactoring, because you don&#x27;t end up modelling the whole world through types.<p>> <i>I don&#x27;t want to start a discussion here on typed vs untyped</i><p>I&#x27;m also thinking you&#x27;re making a confusion. Dynamic languages can be strongly typed. A language Clojure is very much typed. The difference is in the moment those types are used, at compile time or at runtime.<p>This is important, because a dynamic language like Clojure can do optional typing when you want it. Of course, something like core.typed will never be as expressive and potent as Haskell&#x27;s type-system, however this leads to gradual evolution - at first you don&#x27;t have a well defined shape for the data you&#x27;re working with, so you can enjoy the relaxed rules and protocols of Clojure and afterwards you can start introducing type definitions with core.typed or with prismatic/schema.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m a developer that leans on the static side of the argument, however this debate will never be settled simply because which tool is the best depends on the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve, therefore people will never agree on anything, because people are always thinking from their &quot;personal experience&quot;.",1426683943

R also has dplyr is speedy and the data.tables is  even faster. I think the original Julia speed claims were a little biased to Julia and well there is plenty of awesome things about R, but &quot;slow&quot; isn&#x27;t a far statement. There is a reason why R has grown so much.<p>Interesting argument for R usage:

Remember that the scripts usually only need to be run once - maintainability is irrelevant.<p>I don&#x27;t think this all of the difficulty is intrinsic to FP, but FP language designers don&#x27;t usually care about newbie-friendliness. The closest thing to a user-friendly FP language I know about is Scala, and it, too, has lots and lots of arbitrary symbols and hideously complicated function signatures.<p>Remember, the typical scientist has no patience for monads, currying, inscrutable value names or functions-as-arguments and compiler complaints about function signatures are more likely to instill deep hatred than anything else.<p>I know it&#x27;s an extreme example, but a statistician will never try to understand what something like &quot;def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That&quot; means, he&#x27;ll just move on to a language that&#x27;s easier.",1426683602

139745,comment,139164,139164,0,0,brentr,,,"I used to work in the industry, so I will take a stab at explaining this:<p>Bear was overleveraged. The summer of 2007 saw the failure of two internal hedge funds at the company, a confidence crusher. As 2007 wrapped up, the subprime issue spread to other credit markets, effectively freezing the financial system. Bear found it more and more difficult to obtain short-term funding to cover their existing debt that was coming due.
Last week, the CEO came on CNBC and stated that there was no liquidity problem at that time. I don't doubt that statement. Then came Thursday morning. A fund at the Carlyle Group failed, and Bear had a lot of business with the Carlyle group. It was the failure at Carlyle that finally TKOd Bear, but it was only a matter of time before it did indeed happen.
Now, had Bear declared bankruptcy, which they would have had it not been for JP Morgan, a panic none of us have seen in our lifetime would have ensued. Bear would have been forced to dump all of its assets on the market, even the ones that Wall Street doesn't even know how to price. A complete breakdown of the US financial system would have ensued, and there would have likely been a run on not just an investment bank, but a retail bank as well.
The Federal Reserve is not in the business of bailing out companies that mismanage their businesses, but they are in the business of maintaining an orderly market (in addition to their mandate to control the money supply). When Bear went to the Fed on Friday, the Fed knew they'd have to find someone willing to take Bear. JP Morgan was the company best situated to buy Bear; JP Morgan had the capital and was looking for a prime brokerage division and better clearing operations. While Bear provided both of those, there is a large set of unknowns on Bear's balance sheet, and had the Fed not offered to cover up to $30 billion of the more illiquid assets, the deal would have fallen through. Part of the taxes you pay will be used to eat any losses the Fed takes.",1205839952

In most cases the solution is to have your application added to the ports tree (unlike certain ungulate/avian operating systems, FreeBSD doesn't mix up religion and computing, so this isn't only an option for free software), but there are certainly cases where that isn't an option.<p><i>Distributing software to FreeBSD users is generally done via a tarball with maybe a shell script</i><p>I'd say that a more common method is to distribute a package (which can then be installed via pkg_add).<p><i>[The ports tree] asks questions using an ncurses interface, which, as far as I can tell, cannot be disabled.</i><p>This needs to be documented better: Add BATCH=YES into your environment, and the ports infrastructure will run without pestering you.  Of course, there are a few ports which absolutely <i>need</i> to interact with the user (e.g., to have the user accept an EULA) -- if you set BATCH=YES these ports will print an error message rather than installing.",1205839839

139740,comment,139641,139731,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Before continuing my rant, I will mention that I am a FreeBSD amateur and tinkerer, and I know the Linux tools far better than the FreeBSD tools.  I could be entirely wrong in some of my complaints.  I have spent the past two weeks knee deep in FreeBSD package management and scripted installation of a very complex system.  These are the things that have caused me great pain, and I've been unable to overcome them with repeated readings of the documentation--that's not to say they can't be overcome.  I just haven't been able to.<p>""I'm not sure from what you've written what you consider to be the right problem -- can you clarify?""<p>There are actually many problems that yum and apt solve very well, that ports doesn't even consider.  Yes, the fact that ports builds everything from source is, frankly, stupid (OK, not stupid...just solving the wrong problem...it should be a tool used for building the distribution by the developers of the OS, not for installing applications on every freakin' FreeBSD box on the planet while we all grow old waiting on the damned build to finish).<p>I generally use pkgadd -rI to install things, and it works reasonably well (still needs a lot of work--the functionality of pkg* is pretty dismal compared to the rich capabilities of rpm and dpkg, particularly with regards to upgrades and getting information back about what is already installed).  But the lack of binaries isn't really all that big of a concern to me.  It's slow and pointless, but some people like that sort of thing--heck, one nutjob even built a ports style system for Linux and built a whole distro around it, apparently because yum and apt-get were just too damned quick and easy for him.  ;-)<p>Among the issues that ports doesn't solve (and maybe even shouldn't--this might be a job for extensions to the pkg* tools):<p>ports doesn't provide any tools for distribution of software other than that provided by FreeBSD.  As a third party software developer, I can't (easily) add my own ports tree path to a configuration file and from then on my customers will be able to use ports for my software, as well as the FreeBSD stock stuff.  Both yum and apt repos are available for dozens of projects and packages outside of the ""official"" repositories, and it makes using Linux a whole lot more fun.  One can grab newer or custom versions of things, commercial software that doesn't meet the license requirements of the OS repos, etc.  And once installed one can keep them up to date with a simple command ( ""yum update"" or ""apt-get update; apt-get upgrade"" ).<p>Updating with ports is complicated and slow, so even if it were possible to add third party repos, it would still be the wrong tool for the job.  freebsd-update actually manages this better than ports (but again, only for OS-provided packages, and in a quite limited fashion).  Distributing software to FreeBSD users is generally done via a tarball with maybe a shell script...and that's a valid option for some software.  But we've got dozens of packages and they are updated sometimes weekly (much of it is security related--for example we distribute 80 or so installable web applications of wildly varying quality...when Wordpress has a security bug, we have to roll out an update to our installer for that script quickly and easily).<p>Installing software with ports is not scriptable in any sane way.  It asks questions using an ncurses interface, which, as far as I can tell, cannot be disabled.  This is abomination.  pkgadd has the -I option, which means no configuration is done, but at least it is non-interactive.  It even seems to handle dependencies reasonably well, though I may just not be hitting it hard enough yet.  Another few days and I'll begin the heavy lifting and I'll know for sure.<p>So, I think those are the biggies, and being from source isn't really the biggest of them.  If our customers want to wait four hours for our tools to install, that's not really my concern--it's their time, not mine.  But, the other stuff is serious: non-scriptable, no good tools for querying the existing state of the system (versions, locations, etc.) and updating it, and no support for third party software.<p>Anyway, those are the things that spring to mind.  I'm sure I'll think of other stuff to bitch about later, particularly when I'm back to work on the FreeBSD installer for our product.",1205838859

139738,comment,139725,139725,0,0,whalesalad,,,"I'm 18 and have worked for three startups in the past and am currently the lead designer on two. I really don't mean to brag by this, it just leads to my next point. Also, this doesn't fully pertain to programming per say because I am a front end designer, but hopefully this comment helps :)<p>When I was younger, 14 or so, I really became fascinated with server technology, databases, the web, etc... I was just starting High School so I essentially had all the time in the world to dick around with linux and php and all of that jazz, and I did. I was REALLY frustrated until maybe 6 months ago with programming in general. I would try tutorials, and could follow along and do what was written, but it never made sense in my head.<p>I pretty much dismissed the concept of being a programmer and stuck to what I feel is my talent, front end design. I build blogs atop Wordpress, dabbled with PHP, but never really became a programmer.<p>In the summer of 2006 I joined my first startup and began working with a team of really, really talented and smart guys on a Django site. This is where I was first introduced to a real smart environment. I was in a place where I knew just enough to ask good questions to help me learn. It's now 2008 and although I am STILL not a programmer, haha, I feel I have a really good grasp on database modeling, basic functional programming, etc... I know PHP fairly well and am becoming familiar with Python because every major site I have built since that first startup in 06 has been Django :)<p>Anyways, moral of the story is, a few years ago I could have never even dreamed of being where I am today. In the world of front end design <i>and</i> back end programming. I went from looking up to designers like Bryan Veloso, Steve Smith, Dan Cederholm, to actually feeling like I can sit at their lunch table and talk the talk with them. I still admire those guys of course, but now I feel like I am closer to them.<p>So, my advice is to just dive into anything you can, just like you have. It really doesn't matter what language you learn first. Focus on learning the thought processes behind building something. You can write a book in spanish or english, the meaning will be the same. So focus on problem solving, finding solutions.<p>Also, surround yourself with smart people. Stay passionate. If you're passionate about becoming a programmer, you will, and you'll do it the right way. The best way to learn something, hands down, is to just do it. Don't try learning PHP through tutorials on how to make a shopping list, start learning PHP by building the webapp you want to build :)<p>This all kind of just spewed out of my mind, I hope it makes some sense :)",1205838772

139736,comment,139461,139687,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I can't comment on the HN part of your comment, but I like the way you think, rms. People who design interactive web experiences do so under a lot of assumptions. Seems like you are always asking about the edge cases where the assumptions fall flat. What if I want to game the system to get as much karma as possible? What if I want to sell my karma -- it was my time I spent on the site, why shouldn't I own that effort I put in. Would it be any different than sitting side-by-side with another user and telling them how to work the site?<p>I have a feeling it ticks people off, but I like the questions. I think awesome business opportunities are built around folks who ask the same kind of askew questions that others don't consider. It's the lackeys following the main path of least resistance that have a harder time.<p>Good luck with your trip through the wilderness.",1205838464

Which I did.<p>I find it to be great fun, particularly the fact that I now can mock-up whatever ideas I have without having to convince someone else that it is a great idea.<p>I'm currently doing an online project management tool, which I think will turn out pretty well.

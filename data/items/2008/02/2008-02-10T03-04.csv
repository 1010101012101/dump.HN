112880,comment,112864,112876,0,0,boucher,,,"Apple competes with open source all the time.  Linux is the most obvious example, but most consumer open source software competes with either Apple or MS, and open source is almost always losing.  I think what makes this unique is that Firefox is an unusually well designed product that appeals to the average consumer in ways most open source software does not.  It also had a head start, and has a huge user base.<p>In fact, you could argue that unlike usual, Apple is actually winning on technology, and not usability, since perhaps the biggest advantage to firefox is its ability to install plugins.",1202614513
112879,comment,112864,112876,0,0,tolmasky,,,"Apple has open source figured out.  It's the prefect fusion: the core technologies (<a href=""http://webkit.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webkit.org</a>) are open source, but they manage the UI like no one else can.  Software with style, the way it should be.  The WebKit team is absolutely fantastic too, I miss them.",1202614436

But, the shipping version of Safari is also much much faster than Firefox 2, and is still faster than Firefox 3 Beta.

UI/experience design is totally differnt from graphic design and i see a lot of people confusing it still.

They are doing some pretty awesome and forward-looking stuff. The reason they're falling behind, I think, is because the ""yahoo"" brand is so large and complex that it's hard to find anything by going to their site. It probably doesn't help that AOL.com ripped off the design almost to the pixel (I'm extremely surprised there has not been a lawsuit there).",1202612485

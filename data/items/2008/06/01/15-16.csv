As FBSD Security Officer, you also attempted to have the OS disable Hyperthreading, ostensibly to eliminate localhost timing channels. That was a change with user-perceptible impact and minimal security benefit.<p>Second, seperate PCI auditors out from security audits (though Hacker News readers should be familiar with both). I agree with your sentiment regarding PCI auditors. (PCI, for those who don't know, is the Payment Card Industry standard you get audited against if your application accepts credit cards).<p>Third: like it or not, when you get dinged on a report like that, you can lose a sale.

Like simply build a black box model based on the system's past and predict tomorrow based on what you've seen in the past. This works quite well but only for the very short term horizon. And it is not the 'model' you are thinking about.<p>You should dispose of the traditional statistics altogether. It simply does not work in real life and all of the kludges developed to save it (like ARMA models etc) are pointless.<p>As far as his fund is concerned, I would think he has done right by stopping trading in times when his strategy did not work. His strategy was to buy out of money options. Well, we had almost ten years of falling volatility and he would bleed to death in such an environment.

Arrington has done this repeatedly over the last few months.<p>Startups have to strike a balance between getting the architecture right and getting a product out the door. The bright and lucky ones come up with a minimally correct infrastructure which is approximately equal to what they can hammer out with their existing resources in the least amount of time. Most of the time, teams aren't experienced or lucky enough to pull that off, in which case it makes sense to try to fail early --- this means not spending time on infrastructure. They get the concept out, and see if anyone wants it at all. There's no point in releasing a product which scales to 100 million concurrent users if no one wants it. In its early days, Twitter must have done what it could to get its service up and working, and used MySQL for the same reason you (yes, you!) use it: the team was familiar with it, and was used to either stuffing code with SQL strings or using an ORM.<p>After the service took off, a lot of things could have happened. Has Arrington bothered to ask Blaine Cook if he had the resources to do The Right Thing? Did Blaine have the time, or did his company tell him to sit in front a glowing screen and do CPR while the CEO goes out to raise cash?

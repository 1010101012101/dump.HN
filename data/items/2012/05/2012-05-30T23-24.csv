And the same is true elsewhere as well. We thought we had a pretty good grasp on the nature of the expansion of the Universe, but it turned out that the expansion is accelerating. That was a huge reformulation of cosmology. We thought we knew about planetary formation, but once we started finding exoplanets we discovered many of our assumptions were wrong.<p>As far as black holes, we have not 100% direct evidence of them, but we do have many independent and very strong lines of indirect evidence. For example, we can see stars in orbit around an incredibly massive object at the center of our galaxy (Sgr A*) that is not luminous. There are no models that make sense for anything that could be so massive and so dark. Black holes are the only theory which fits all the evidence we have, that's how science works.",1338421912

They definitely exist though, and have done even before SSDs, it just had a normal disk hanging off it.<p>Battery-backed cache has probably been around even longer in write caches for large RAID systems.<p>The 5% power and shutdown is also how the Macbook laptops handle sleep. Sleep mode is a low power nothing-but-ram mode, and when the battery gets too low, it goes into 'safe sleep', basically a dump-to-disk all-powered-off hibernate.<p>The main reason it's not all that common is that for the sort of workloads you're prepared to pay for a shitload of RAM, you're probably just using it as a cache for a DB or some monster app, and actually keeping it around isn't that much of a priority. You've got failover somewhere else in the stack, and it's one less thing to buy and maintain.<p>The other critical flaw is that there is a (potentially huge) performance hit in presenting as a disk vs hanging off the northbridge MMU. Even the latest in new fancy SATA is hilariously slow compared to the actual memory bus (6Gbps for SATA3 vs maybe 100Gbps for DDR3[1]), and having all the filesystem abstraction on top, as in the titular article of this thread mentions, is a whole lot more overhead.<p>So yeah. We can. Sometimes people do.

Namely, instead of diffing and merging text, the goal is to parse the program and diff/merge the AST.<p>EDIT: A better way to state the goal: I want to take advantage of the underlying structure of a computer program to inform the diff/merge. The first step just happens to be diffing ASTs, but I go beyond this.<p>I already have some neat features--for example, I can detect moves fairly robustly. That is, if you move a function, I can see that as a single action even if you modify the function a little bit when moving it (e.g. rename the parameters). Also, there is already more information for resolving conflicts in a three-way merge.<p>Unfortuntely, the performance is currently horrible, which makes it completely unusable. Once I fix that (I just need to memoize the diff function properly) and fiddle around with some of the algorithms a bit, I'll have something interesting (I hope :)). After that, I'll probably add a UI.<p>Also, I should add that I'm not the only person with this idea. A lot of the early design and features are based on YDiff[1], although I used no code from there. The merging and some of the other stuff I'm working on right now is more original though (I think).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/ydiff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/ydiff/</a>",1338420530

Seriously.   Why allow them to drain your resources when they could be draining your competitor's instead?<p>Back in the day, I worked for a large e-commerce company.  We started a project to track customer value.  Simplified, customer value = total_purchases - (total_returns  * return_processing_cost_factor) .  We had customers who had made dozens of purchases but had negative value to us because they returned almost everything they ordered.  We wanted to keep free, no-hassle returns but these people were abusing us.  The only solution?  Get rid of them as quickly as possible.  We discussed--half seriously--giving them gift certificates to competitors and even closing their accounts.  There are plenty of less-harsh methods, too.  We talked about identifying their Caller ID when they called customer service to make a return and intentionally putting them on hold for a little bit longer.<p>Since you aren't really an e-commerce company, your solution will be different.   Figure out a metric for customer value and act on that metric.   Whether it's discontinuing service, or moving them to slower servers, or de-prioritizing their customer service inquiries, look for ways to gently encourage them to go elsewhere.<p>You can't feel too badly about this.

I'm playing with a Bayesian classifier (or attempting and learning a lot) to auto-detect the language and appropriately set the syntax highlighting automatically without a dropdown and a reload. The paste will also be saved automatically so there isn't a page load for anything.<p>I'm still hacking away and haven't got very far whilst I'm getting my head around the classifier. One other problem I've noticed is keeping track of ownership. One solution I have in mind is that there is no ownership: when it's modified it generates a new link to share with. It might be good for very simple code collaboration - I've tried doing this with Pastebin over Facebook chat and this should make the process a whole lot smoother.<p>I also need to think about how training will work. I envisioned it so that the user can train it i.e if it guesses wrong, the user would correct it by selecting the proper language and the program will learn for the future. I'd be putting a lot of faith in potential future users but I'm not expecting it to be big or anything, maybe just something me and my friends can share and work on code friction-free (some don't have GitHub/BitBucket/etc accounts, one doesn't like CAPTCHAs at all).<p>I'm currently going off 100% self-education here too so I'm having to get to grips with some other maths stuff like some symbols (such as | means conditional probability and _not_ to be confused logical OR), so if the project falls flat on its face at least I learned something from it :)",1338419992

Of course I'm automatically a crackpot (even beyond a conspiracy theorist) for even suggesting that.<p>As an example to how bad things have become in the realm of physics, it's safe to say that the vast majority of thinking adults believe that black holes exist, because so much major media has told them so. But when you look deeper you find that there's no definitive evidence. Sites like the Chandra X-Ray Observatory admit that, deep in their FAQ, but in words that many people can misconstrue as a technicality. When I point out in physics discussions that that there's no definitive evidence of black holes, I'm automatically labeled a crackpot, especially by the working physicists.

4045328,comment,4044591,4044693,5,0,snprbob86,,,"This seems like one of those ""sounds good on paper"" ideas, like shells that pipe objects. In practice, file and process oriented systems are separate from REPL systems on purpose.<p>The most important property of a filesystem or the Unix-style pipes&filters that permeate them is the fact that serialization is a fundamental property component of persistence and communication. Any finite quantity of space can be addressed by a linear scheme and any unbounded sequence is inherently linear. Consider what happens as soon as you want to send a stream of data across the wire. Or checkpoint an operation. You need to store stuff in a non-volatile and linear form. And since data outlives code, you better invest time into thinking about that linear form.<p>Now, if you use immutable data structures (ie. non-cyclical) with a proper linearization and corresponding reader/printer  (like in Clojure), you can get many of the same benefits, but you still need to have a whole bunch of other things to worry about. Just look at the weird things that Clojure needs to do with <i>print-dup</i> and the like.<p>I'm not saying that there isn't a kernel of a good idea in here. I'm just saying that it's going to have a lot more in common with filesystems and traditional shells than you'd first expect coming from a Lisp REPL school of thought.",1338418821

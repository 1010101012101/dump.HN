135758,comment,135494,135494,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"I hope you understand that while javascript has its uses, most web applications are built on server side scripting languages. Much to the chagrin of the hackers here at YC, I personally would recommend learning PHP or Python. Probably PHP though. (Cue Ruby fanboys and anti-php lynch mobs). Really, it is the place to start if you're interested in Web 2.0 application development. Javascript is a tool you can pick up later that allows you to do cool things with your site. But I mean, wouldn't you rather jump right into doing things right? Starting with javascript will end up being sort of like...taking a class in school; you have to learn a bunch of things first, figure out something to make, embed with HTML and toy around and in the end, do you even get anything functional? How bland is that?! Now, if you start with a server side scripting language, you get your ""hello world"" experience and you jump right in.<p>Just my 2 cents...",1205384945

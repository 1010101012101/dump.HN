2717572,comment,2715991,2717209,14,0,swombat,,,"The reason you're being downvoted is because this has been explained a fair number of times on HN. The problem with using SHA-* or MD5 for hashing is that those algorithms are designed to be <i>fast</i>. This means that it's relatively easy for a cracker with a dump of the database to bruteforce passwords, since they can try gazillions of combinations very quickly. Hell, they can even parallelise the task on EC2 and get it all done in an hour.<p>By contrast, computing bcrypt takes a significant amount of time and CPU. It's slow. It's designed to be slow. It's designed so that you will need a LOT of CPU power to bruteforce it.<p>So, no, SHA-512 is not much better than MD5. It's still a fail.",1309510694

Most of these languages are domain-specific (e.g to hedge fund accounting or certain web-rendering tasks), but I also have a Turing-equivalent token-based language which is concatenative in nature.  I think my language is simpler than Forth because I use a global key-value storage context which supports ordered iteration, giving you the power of ""hashes"" and ""lists"" without actually having those as first-class data objects.<p>My point being that I'm becoming more enamored of the tinyvm approach, namely the use of ""opcodes"" with very simple operational semantics.

There are no good IDEs for javascript. Library support is bad (Greensock? Flixel?) You don't honestly think that your 99$ library holds its own against these completely free features: <a href=""http://flixel.org/features.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flixel.org/features.html</a>
Also People can much more easily steal your code and images than in Flash.<p>As soon as Javascript really catches up with Flash on most of these things (which will still take a few years) we hopefully can program in Native Client which will destroy both Javascript and Flash.<p>Extra topic on why browsers refuse to implement native client:
If someone could explain what stake Browsers have in Javascript, I'd love to hear it. I have two theories:
Browsers want to keep the web as ""open"" as possible. This means Javascript, because native binary executables would close this up immediately.
On the other hand, I don't really understand the point of this openess. Every other market in existance goes by fine with binaries. Vendors give you tutorials and examples on how to build software. So what is the point of being open? To steal code? I don't see any other reason anymore.<p>So I don't really think it's about being open for browser vendors. It's about control. If anyone can trivially write their own layout engine, has their own favorite language on the client....what are browsers worth then? Absolutely nothing, they would be degraded to cURL.<p>It can't be security. Obviously javascript can call c code too, Nodejs does it. It's about sandboxing, and I see zero reasons why it can't be possible to sandbox pure c properly.",1309508015

Lots of details and stories about the things he was up to.<p>I was roaming around inside networks and machines around the same time as these guys and I don't think it was a romantic era, but it was an era in which the laws were very lax and you'd likely get a slap on the wrist rather than a jail sentence.  Lots of systems were open, anonymous FTP was the norm, and it was trivial to spoof email using SMTP commands typed through telnet since the SMTP servers trusted whoever connected to them.  Also many dial up systems used either no security (i.e. if you knew the number it was enough to get in), or really trivial passwords.  Networks were easy to monitor once you were in and most passwords were sent plain text (the assumption was that you couldn't see the X.25 or TCP packets themselves, but, of course, you could).<p>I remember on one occasion receiving an email from a system administrator in a university where I had changed the 'ls' program to be a trojan of my own design.

Off the top of my head, the things we&#x27;ve done because of 9/11:<p>* Create DHS<p>* Begin TSA security theater<p>* Start illegal NSA metadata collection program<p>* Afghanistan + Iraq (&quot;not related&quot;, but had support from misinformed public) wars.<p>A good thing I can think of: more secure cockpit doors. On balance, yeah, I wish we had done nothing after 9/11. On the other hand it&#x27;s not <i>impossible</i> for good actions as a result, but we have a pretty bad track record of it.<p>The importance of putting the _actual_ consequences in perspective is to let you at least consider that maybe we don&#x27;t have to do anything sometimes. It&#x27;s like the 80/20 rule or anything with diminishing marginal returns: to actually achieve flat out 100% safety and security is going to be an extremely expensive endeavor both in monetary terms and in how our society and ideals have to change.",1448603940

When people are scared out of their minds they tend to respond reflexively rather than rationally, and in the case of terrorism they tend to do things that make things worse (confer legitimacy on the &quot;enemy,&quot; give them the war they want, invade Iraq) or things that are totally tangential or even orthogonal to the problem (warrantless domestic wiretapping and mass collection of phone data; giving law enforcement tools and training brutally put down protests; invade Iraq).

So what?  How does this make them more secure if the device cannot provide the public to the end-user so they can match it to the one they got in the SSH or HTTPS connection before they establish that connection?  The problem here is a chicken or the egg one, plain and simple.  If they accept the security warnings and connect to the device, a man in the middle can simply tamper with the encrypted traffic so that when they view the device cert, it&#x27;s the one they see in the connection.  This I&#x27;m afraid is the elephant in the room when it comes to device connectivity over protocols utilizing public / private key cryptography.<p>Of course this problem can be solved, but I would propose that it wouldn&#x27;t be cheap in many cases and doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem.  For devices with no display output the manufacturer could fire the device up on the product line and then obtain the public after it is generated.  They could then print it out or save it to a USB drive and put it in the box with the device.  Ultimately; however, the end user getting the device will have no idea what that paper or USB drive is and it will be promptly ignored anyway and browser or SSH security warnings will be accepted just as they are today.<p>The assumption for all of these products should be that they are untrustworthy until made trustworthy, even if they are generating their own unique key material.  With that in mind they should be configured on isolated, trusted networks until which point they are secured.  The only way to make them secure is if they can generate unique key material or accept organizational key material and then the connections are validated before establishing encrypted communication with the devices.  Ideally this means having an organizational PKI program that can issue certificates to devices which are then validated against an organizational root CA or exporting the device generated public and importing it into hosts which will be used to connect with the device.<p>This I belive is the conversation we need to be having here.",1448602176

As github pages, technically are virtual domains, they share the same ip with many other pages, if you want to support https, you need to serve either each page on a different ip (not free), or they need a to configure multidomain ssls (which everytime they need to add a new domain, that means they have to reset the certificate for the other domains on the same ip), and I think there is a limit on the number of domains that can share the same ip - citation needed - .

Where you see a lie, I see a truth that causes misdirection when vitalists trip over their own logical shortcomings.<p>Let&#x27;s get one thing straight: you&#x27;re the one who wants to extend the current definition of &quot;lie&quot; to include this particular brand of misdirection and then censor that misdirection. You&#x27;re the one who wants to &quot;hold advertisers to a higher standard&quot; in the name of benefiting society. I&#x27;m the one advocating the comparatively hands-off approach of continuing to restrict censorship to literally false statements.

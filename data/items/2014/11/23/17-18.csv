8649343,comment,8646758,8648054,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One of the more interesting things that I believe this period will contribute to the field of economics is the question of investment vs spending.<p>That savings become investment because the bank can only make money when the money it holds works for it, is a principle that we all learn in Econ, however after the Mortgage crisis and the response to it, there has been a twist. For very large banks, and for most US citizens they only have very large banks to interact with, they stopped investing in the outer layers of the economy. Banks stopped lending to a large swath of people in part because as a large portion their deposits could be consolidated into very large pools which were used in more abstract investment schemes. Even today if you read Bank of America&#x27;s annual report you will note that their investments benefit a much smaller percentage of the population than they have in the past[1]. There are merchant banks that are investing in local infrastructure but retail banks, historically a big component in that area, still suffering from the malaise of the breakdown between banking and trading which still has a cloud over them.<p>I don&#x27;t think the book is written yet on the entirety of the challenges set up by the consolidation of capital, it certainly will provide fodder for a number of Phds in the discipline :-) But the events of the last 15 years have shown us that when you consolidate large amounts of capital into the hands of a few, their choices on investing it disenfranchise a number of previously valid capital markets. You will note that it is tied in with Piketty&#x27;s observations and others about dis-contiguous capital pools. When the .01% start disenfranchising the the .99% it might feel to us in the 99% like the Gods fighting amongst themselves on Olympus, but it seems to have really material effects at a micro and macro economic level.<p>I am convinced, although I don&#x27;t feel that my belief is widely held, is that direct transfer payments in BI (or UBI) schemes &quot;work&quot; because they <i>force</i> capital diffusion. And it is the market forces that seek to consolidate that capital that pull the capital through the economy. I originally held the opinion that such diffusion, which has to come at the cost of taxing those capital pools in the first place, would remove the incentives for those people to collect it (the old &#x27;communist trap&#x27; you learn about, if you&#x27;re not going to get to keep it, why work for it). The change though is the force multiplier effect of modern technology which has increased productivity for those who employ it far far above that of previous workers. That and a growing inefficiency of the existing transfer payments system have suggested we may have reached that point where the combined increase in efficiency of abolishing welfare and a modest tax on very large capital consolidations could provide an outsized economic benefit. The danger (or the trick of it if you will) is to manage the capital burden so that it remains a positive benefit. You essentially want a &#x27;leaky bucket&#x27; algorithm for capital diffusion. Which is why I expect that until the next shoe &quot;drops&quot; which is the complete relaxation on the energy component[2], such systems will never be sufficient, in and of themselves, to be a &#x27;living stipend&#x27;.<p>[1] I realize that much of Bank of America is trying to unwind some disastrous CountryWide mortgages.<p>[2] That would occur if we were to crack the fusion problem such that energy production was no longer limited by external factors.",1416765392

8649327,comment,8646787,8648097,0,0,msandford,,,"If you want to go deep enough for the system scale to be reasonable, you have to get a big drilling rig.  You&#x27;ll hit rock within a couple hundred feet or perhaps a thousand, but I&#x27;m not sure of anywhere in the world with 5,000-10,000 feet of dirt.<p>The problem with going shallower is that the system capacity is directly proportional to depth and weight.  Too shallow and you have to have huge weight and that means a large diameter hole and really big cables and such.<p>But going deeper requires drilling through rock, and aquifers which are located within the rock.  That means big regulatory hurdles because nobody wants to poison the aquifer on accident.  Plus the large costs of drilling through rock.<p>I really like the idea from a theoretical standpoint.  It&#x27;s very elegant.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem practical from an economic or regulatory standpoint.  If there are places where you can get the diameter and depth for free, it&#x27;s clearly genius.

We&#x27;ve had the experience that almost all users prefer it that way, so we try to enable every reporter to get the newest version by simply updating instead of having to check out the git repository.<p>As @fillipo said above, there is little if any pushback from video sites. Most of the time, they update their interface (we&#x27;ve gotten better in anticipating minor changes) and something breaks. The recent string of YouTube breaks (for some videos, mostly music videos - general video is unaffected) is caused by the complexity of their new player system, which forces us to behave more and more like a full-fledged webbrowser.

That&#x27;s the point of sous vide. It heats the water temperature to a very specific point. The food will heat throughout until it&#x27;s uniformly at that temperature. A few minutes extra won&#x27;t make any difference because it&#x27;s the temperature that determines the texture of the food (for most dishes), not how long it&#x27;s been at that temperature[0].<p>Boiling water is 100 degrees Celsius and egg-white denatures at what, 40-45C? So <i>your</i> eggs will overcook, the sous-vide ones won&#x27;t.<p>(<i>edit:</i> turns out it&#x27;s more like 60-67C, before anyone runs out to try it based on my post, I&#x27;d have looked this up before trying)<p>> in your busy morning you&#x27;re going to vacuum pack a steak? Seriously?<p>I never quite understood why it needs to be <i>vacuum</i> packed, actually. If you drop it in a plastic baggie, submerging into water will push the airbubbles out nicely.<p>> Or you can turn your oven to 200F. Toss a cast iron pan on your grilltop and sear at high heat, then move the whole thing to the oven. You&#x27;ll quickly have a perfect steak without blowtorches or extended water bath time.<p>Ummmyeah... that would work. If you had gotten it right :) Steak goes into the oven <i>first</i>, cast iron skillet <i>after</i> (and then of course rest for five minutes before cutting it), and 200F is way too hot, that&#x27;s like 93C, firmly beyond &quot;well done&quot; and into &quot;shoe&quot; territory. You can take it out before that happens obviously, but your steak won&#x27;t be heated uniformly, in particular if you seared it <i>before</i>, you&#x27;ll get an unnecessarily large transition layer (which the tough layer on the outside of a non-perfect steak) between the perfectly rare or medium inside (which is the part you want most of) and the brown crust outside (which you also want, but just for extra flavour and appearance).<p>It&#x27;s just chemistry and physics.<p>> As with the soylent thing, it&#x27;s like basic skills are now lacking so people looking for a lot of menial work to replace trivial undertakings.<p>I can accept the cynicism about the Soylent thing, but sous vide cooking is not just for &quot;basic&quot; cooking skills or to replace &quot;trivial undertakings&quot;. Hey if you just want to cook a pretty good steak, go ahead and do that oven/skillet thing, mess it up like in your description if you like, because if you practice enough you&#x27;ll get the timing <i>just</i> right and probably end up with a pretty damn good steak nearly all the time nonetheless. If you want a <i>perfect</i> steak, you want sous vide + blowtorch.<p>And in fairness, I do want to point out that a &quot;pretty good&quot; steak made from good quality meat will totally blow away a &quot;perfect&quot; (not) steak made from shitty meat (e.g. cheap frozen steaks). I tried and sous vide doesn&#x27;t help at all. In fact overcooking it the traditional way might even help to cover up the shittyness. I do feel for the cow, whose life destiny was to end up as mere shitty frozen steak .. :-/<p><i>Anyway</i>, in addition, the workflow of sous vide has a few benefits with regards to attention and timing. However I grant that certain traditional ways cooking can have other benefits. You may probably also take comfort in the assumption that people that invest in a sous vide machine really love cooking, and that for that reason they will probably invest in a good cast iron skillet <i>first</i>. Because if you love cooking you simply need one.<p>Finally, and I get a hunch you were thinking this but not saying it, I think the hacker / geek-factor of applying chemistry and physics concepts to the kitchen should not be dismissed either. It&#x27;s a gadget with a thermostat and you even get to use a blowtorch after! You can quite easily build your own from basic electronic components (also check tropical fish aquarium supplies) and learn stuff about feedback control systems! You can experiment with crazy weird ways of preparing food! (what happens to cubes of marinated pork belly after 24 hours at ~55C for 24 hours is not just amazingly heavenly, but also impossible to achieve without sous vide) (try and find it at a restaurant if you don&#x27;t care for the DIY, worth it).<p>Â <p>[0] Now if you keep it at that temperature for more than a few <i>hours</i>, some &quot;interesting&quot; things may happen. Certain meats will become unnaturally tender (which may or may not be desirable), I dunno what happens to eggs though.

In terms of security, I don&#x27;t see where there have been any great number of exploits attacking the kernel (XNU) or userland (mostly FreeBSD) layers. Recent high-profile vulnerabilities like heartbleed were hardly OSX specific. I&#x27;m also not sure that those layers can really be called inefficient relative to Linux.

Even at 3am, my nearest subway line runs trains 2-3 times per hour.<p>Unfortunately, underutilized transit options are subject to a vicious cycle wherein it&#x27;s impossible to justify running more frequent service for low ridership, and lack of frequent service suppresses ridership. Once you do have a strong public transit culture, it builds on itself and makes investment in frequency an obvious choice (not just for convenience but because you need more buses/trains to fit more passengers!)",1416762007

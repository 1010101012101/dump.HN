I just kind of throw windows around and resize them with an ease and speed that I was never able to achieve on Emacs. For instance, when using Emacs I may have as many as 4 windows open at a time, frequently switching buffers around with the clumsy C-x b switching (I know there are better switchers). With Acme, I'll have 30 windows open, most of them stacked up with just the tag lines visible until I need them. When I need one, I just mid-click on the little box and it expands.<p>Execution of arbitrary text and loading/plumbing files/text with the mouse buttons is also really powerful for me, as you point out. I haven't finished watching the video yet (I'm at work), but in case he doesn't cover it, mouse chording is one of the most important capabilities in my mind.

If someone is using social networking sites to write poems to their other half I can understand they might find it somewhat creepy to give a recruiter or employer access to that.<p>The type of content they have on their twitter/FB is going to depend on what they use it for primarily and who their friends are.<p>I don't use FB but if I did I would mainly to communicate with people I know in real life, most of whom are not technical.

Later the bomb goes off with the intent of killing people.<p>I don't consider Columbine to be similar to this in spirit because 1) the boys brought the bomb with them that day; it wasn't set up ""in advance"". 2) the bomb wasn't intended to hurt people, really; it was to draw people out so the boys could shoot them.

Pleased to meet you.<p>Thanks for taking a few hundred words I wrote over a lunch break and extracting from them a warped inference that I must be a racist, misogynistic bigot.<p>I actually have no such biases. I'm a leftist-liberal who reads The Guardian, I've worked in the public sector for many years which in the UK means having to know employment law inside out, and have specifically worked out of my recruitment process anything that could impede somebody getting a job in my team that other employers would secretly harbour as an excuse.<p>My hiring strategy is a bit like Valve software's: T-shaped skillsets are gold, and I ask the three questions: What would happen if this person were to become my boss? Would I learn a significant amount from them? How would I feel if they went to work for a competitor?<p>I just like to understand candidate's beyond a single sheet CV before they come into interview. They might spend 10 hours a day playing Minecraft. Cool, let's talk about that, and how they like to hack around with it a little. They might spend their weekends canoeing. I hate physical exertion, but cool, let's talk about the challenges canoeing provides and how they deal with them. They might be a devout Scientologist. OK, I don't get Scientology personally, but I know employment law well enough to know that's no barrier to you getting the job - I've heard Scientology is really big on clarity of communication through ""auditing"", so let's talk about how that's helped the candidate in the workplace, 'k?<p>I am not a white male bigot who hires people like me. I work with women, non-white, non-atheist, non-Christian, non-liberal, non-leftist, non-English (I'm British), people all day, every day and have done so for many years.<p>The fact you assume a potential employer who is betting a substantial amount of money on you is interested in your personal life for any other reason than to understand you better and to make sure you're going to be a great fit, is cynical, naive and misguided.<p>It might be rooted in a truth with some employers, but I don't think those employers live in the world of technology - particularly startups. Perhaps that's naive of me. Perhaps that is a problem. So let's talk about the wider issuer of ""worst-case scenario"" - if somebody on discovering who you really are <i>is</i> prejudiced against you, wouldn't you rather they hadn't hired you - especially in a start-up environment where your legal recourse is highly limited - than for them to find out a week into employment when you've moved across a continent and now you're fucked?<p>If somebody is a penguin-murderer, why would I want to know that as an employer other than to rule them out immediately? Because somebody who enjoys torturing animals probably has an interesting approach to teamwork that isn't going to fit into the way I like to run my teams. I'd want to spend some time in interview understanding that a little more, precisely because I <i>don't</i> want them turning up on day one and it being a disaster.<p>Yes, I was being flippant, but there's an important point there, somewhere.<p>Asserting that my ""real agenda and biases"" are hidden from view is wrong, and the assertion that this is therefore worrying is flawed.<p>Hope that clears things up for you.",1347903519

Think about the social implications for a minute.<p>If you do this in the most efficient way - grab profiles with a simple algorithm, then send the same pitch email to everyone using blind-carbon-copy - you're cold-calling. The problem with cold-calling is that it doesn't enhance your reputation. Do you really want your name and email address filed in the spam filter along with the clumsiest of recruiters? Do you really want to experience the indignity of being unfriended on LinkedIn?<p>Just wait until your amateur spam-o-rama accidentally hits four employees <i>and</i> a hiring manager at another company. They will talk to each other, and figure out that you're attempting to ""poach"" their employees in the clumsiest possible way, and now your name is mud, twice over.<p>Cold-calling does work, though. (There's no shortage of evidence.) Most of the best candidates don't surf job listings for entertainment, and those few who do are window-shoppers, who have trained themselves to read but not to act. But they might respond to a little poke, when it happens to arrive at the right time. But: You can't be doing that nagging yourself. Frankly, you need a scapegoat. A third party. Perhaps someone whose job description protects their reputation a bit: Everyone knows that recruiters gotta recruit, or be fired.<p>Alternatively, to be kind to your colleagues, you can screen profiles more carefully, making sure not to email people who are obviously not a fit, and making sure not to target the employees of companies run by your friends, and making sure to write lovingly personalized emails to each person, asking about their dog and their kids and then oh-so-discreetly suggesting, as if by accident, that maybe they'd like a new job? This strategy works to some degree - it is, in fact, what most of us do as we wander down the hall at a conference - but it doesn't scale. We call it <i>networking</i>, but when you have to do it with 100+ developers it is a full-time job called <i>recruiting</i>. Perhaps you should consider outsourcing it?

In fact in practice tests run for a long window of time over which you have good evidence that the distribution is <i>not</i> stationary.  For example in the middle of running a long test that eventually found a small lift, I've often run and rolled out a second test that generated a much stronger lift.<p>The weaker assumption that you need is that the preference between versions is stable across your fluctuations.  Then because the mix of versions is time independent, that non-stationary fluctuation is not statistically different between the slice that was put into A and the slice that was put into B.  And therefore the variation between different samples becomes just another unknown random factor that does not interfere with your statistical analysis of whether there is a difference.<p>This is an advantage between A/B testing and the current state of the art in MAB algorithms.  When this came up before, Noel (at Myna) and I privately did an admittedly brief search of the literature for discussion of this point with regards to MAB algorithms.  We turned up a number of things that would work in the long run, but none that directly addressed the problem.<p>But in discussion we did manage to come up with effective MAB algorithms, whose regret is only a constant factor worse than standard MAB algorithms, that accurately will identify stable preferences in the face of constantly fluctuating conversion rates.  To the best of my knowledge nobody, including Noel, has yet implemented such algorithms in practice.  But in principle it can be done.<p>However even if you do it, several of my other points still apply as real differences.",1347903195

I've worked with some of the best designers and they always produced beautiful assets and screens, but we were always left making important UX decisions that caused inconsistency with other apps. The ""beauty"" that many users come to appreciate with iOS and Metro, is the cross app consistency, experience and cohesion with the operating system itself. Even apps produced by Google have a tremendously wide gap in consistency. The other major problem is development decisions made (and allowed by the platform) by software engineers.

MongoDB is one of the few (next to Hbase and a few others) that adopts Google BigTable's architecture: data is divided in Ranges, and each mongod node serves multiple Ranges.<p>This means MongoDB is able to provide atomicity where it's harder with other SQL databases. In particular, we need to be able to do some sort of ""compare and swap"" operation that is guaranteed to be atomic/consistent, while still being able to have our mongod nodes distributed over multiple datacenters.<p>In Dynamo-based architectures, in order to provide the same amount of atomicity, you always end up writing to at least half + 1 the amount of replicated nodes you have available in your cluster. This is more awkward, and reduces the flexibility of the whole (the atomicity guarantee Mongo provides also works for stored javascript procedures, for example).<p>Having said that, we're using MongoDB about 3 years in production at this point, but we're far from happy about the availability it provides (issues like MongoDB not detecting that a node has gone down, failing to fail over, etc). We run a HA service, and to date <i>all</i> of our failures in uptime have been either the fault of our hosting provider or mongodb not failing over when it should. As such, we're always looking for a better alternative to move to, but at the moment MongoDB is about as good as it gets.",1347901892

And claiming that a rapid price drop means there's ""almost no profit margin"" and then equating that to the death of hardware seems completely upside down.<p>If hardware manufacturing has dropped to the point where complex devices are cheap to buy then we are entering a golden age of hardware since it means that manufacturing and design process has got cheap enough that many things that were previously too expensive to design/manufacture will be made.<p>It can also herald an era of 'mom and pop' hardware companies.",1347901723

4533549,comment,4533310,4533490,4,0,KirinDave,,,"This is a complaint about Mobile in general, not Android. People bitch about fragmentation (and it is a bit painful), but in the regard of ""everyone has their own UX on top of the system default"" iOS is in exactly as bad a boat, if not worse. Some of the most popular iOS apps take their UX off in crazy directions (a common example: Tweetbot).<p>Look closely though. You'll notice the ActionBar is extremely prevalent in these. The ActionBar is actually one of those few Android teachable moments; I wish Apple did this as well, as consistently, or as themably. I've used a lot of these apps (and I am sad to not see Pattrn up there!) and it's very much the case that they have a fairly consistent set of ""touch semantics"" that screenshots don't reveal. E.g., Tap upper right corner to configure; long press for edit; swipe horizontally to navigate; long press on text fields to engage c/p editor bar.<p>For better or worse, Android's toolkits offer a lot more guidance to the programmer on ""the right way"" than Apple's do (a great example of this that bleeds into UI is how Android has a ton of Loader patterns and iOS doesn't have anything nearly so sophisticated in its core lib). So in some respects, Android is actually slightly better off; the bigger toolkit means you get some superior consistency. The recent iterations (and backported support) framework strongly encourages you to do things like support long presses and swipe navigation and backpane navigation.",1347901482

With rapid prototyping and open-sourcing of 3D printers, fabrications shops and the like, the opportunity to create new hardware devices is easier now than ever before.<p>The issue the article focuses on is commoditizing of hardware. Tablets all essentially have the same components and the economies of scale are exaggerated. When you have multiple manufacturers of very similar devices they all start reducing their margins to gain market share. This is a race to the bottom, and I believe the point the article is trying to make.<p>However, the innovators of hardware are the winners. New devices that create new markets, new functions, new possibilities for consumers have the potential to sell large volumes at high margins. This has the advantage of the added barrier of manufacturing. Competitors take longer to tool-up and compete, giving first-movers a larger advantage than software producers. The iPod, for example, still remains the leader to this day.<p>Hardware isn't dead, it just becomes a commodity over time. To avoid reaching the bottom, you have to be a company that's always innovating, just like software. Creating new products, vastly improving design, etc. Leave the copycats in China to turn it into a commodity, you should be onto your next big thing by the time that becomes an issue.",1347901213

I have hosting service at ixwebhosting.com and website meteo-rs.com on it. This morning I find out that the website is down and I contacted their live 24/7 chat ""support"". Live chat support staff forwarded my problem to Ticket Center where another person took the ticket and forwarded it to another person, this person changed ticket status from 'Open' to 'Working' and again back to 'Open'. My website is still down. They already promised to me that the issue will be fixed in couple of hours. After couple of hours waiting I went to live chat support to ask what's going on. There I only received this message: ""Your ticket is forwarded to our appropriate department. It will be replied as soon as possible."" After several more hours of waiting I again received that message. My site is still down for tents of hours! Only what I get from their support is:""Please let me ask you to wait for the ticket reply. It will be replied once it is possible."" When I ask for any time line, they say: ""I'm sorry but there is no exact timeline available at the moment."" Crappy hosting provider. Don't buy anything at ixwebhosting.com",1323262778

I think I've read that phrase about 9 phones this year...<p>HTC has been enjoying growing at a break-neck speed and continue to ride that Android wave; you see the stress cracks in everything they do if you are actually putting your money down for their cutting edge devices.<p>Their older devices may fare better. I have a friend with a myTouch 4G that he picked up a year after launch and said he has no problems with it and battery life is solid.<p>The next time there is an HTC device announced that you think looks interesting, read the forums for the device for the first week and I <i>guarantee</i> you will find complaints about hardware and software bugs (screen problems, camera not working right, battery life unexplainably short, etc. etc.)<p>I don't meant to hand-wave with a bunch of negativity here...

They're not the prettiest girl at the dance anymore, and they don't get a lot of love on these pages. But they've quietly positioned themselves as a very serious force in the entertainment space with the XBox platform. And they've been known to throw big chunks of their warchest at strategic acquisitions.<p>Facebook may also be a potential buyer. They've got a huge userbase that they need to keep engaged, and if they acquired a blue-chip content platform, it would be a huge deal.<p>Amazon, absolutely. Makes total sense for them across so many dimensions.<p>Apple, yes and no. Owning Netflix would be nice, but their hands would be tied on how to leverage it. How do you use Netflix to sell iPads, because restricting it to iPads is not a viable option? Doing so would piss off the entire userbase -- possibly devaluing the platform fundamentally, and giving competitors a major opening. They might be able to offer some sort of premium tier that is available only on Apple devices. But even that would be iffy as a draw. Then they've got the issue of how to make Netflix and iTunes live together in a coherent, cohesive, sensible way. I could, however, see Apple's buying Netflix as a purely defensive maneuver if Amazon made a bid.<p>Google, I could see pretty easily. They've been trying to make premium content deals for years now. Netflix could make sense for G+, YouTube, Android, etc.",1323262713

Also applies more generally to relationships, both of which can be hard to manage.<p>I'm sure there are many more examples, knowing your limits is key to being happy with your achievements.",1323259302

My bank has phoned me up multiple times to check transactions. On one occasion they simply ""black-holed"" a credit card transaction and didn't bother to tell me, nor did the merchant contact me. On another, they made a simple purchase take 45 minutes of phone-tag because buying a bed is an ""unusual"" purchase. Well, DUH. Moving house is pretty fucking unusual, too.<p>I now try to remember to phone them before buying computer bits or large ""unusual"" purchases, but that has a 50% chance of a dropped call as they try to transfer my request.<p>So, no, PayPal aren't really any different to any other payment processor in my experience.",1323259291

You don't want to get caught in a bubble.<p>You better sharpen the ""perceived value"" everybody, er, perceives, with your OWN value judgement that takes facts, numbers, long term factors etc into account. Else, you're trading blindly based on what everybody else perceives, which is really fickle.",1323259272

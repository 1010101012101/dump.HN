145002,comment,144321,144667,0,0,Hexstream,,,"""About the only way to make money without creating wealth is to steal it from somebody else.""<p>Well. Let's say you have a company M that creates X wealth and has a monopoly. And then you have companies A, B, C, D, E and F that create 7x wealth but are driven out of the market by M's monopolistic practices. M indeed creates wealth, but the market is actually getting less than it would without it. It might not be called stealing, but I feel robbed.<p>Similarly, I'm pretty sure the value the spammer is creating for the companies they advertise for is largely offset by the value it's destroying for the masses of people they advertise to. Besides, the kind of ""products"" sold by ""companies"" via spammers is not exactly friendly neighborhood or good quality (if there's even an actual product at all).<p>edit: ""Typically when somebody pays you for something you did, it's because they'd rather have your service or product than the cash they paid for it.""<p>Sure, but maybe there's another service/product that could give you much more for the same money but you don't know about it because of propaganda (marketing, FUD) or simply because the company has been driven out of the market unfairly, as I said earlier.",1206392303

I know a top hacker who's not only good at system abstractions but also knows bare metal like the back of his hand, debugging live applications with heavy OS interactions by patching running binary on the fly without needing to lookup a reference. Everyone around him is in awe. However, he's not that interested in money. He thinks he's rich enough with a few millions in options and 300k in annual salary & bonuses. And he's happy with his job and his boss, who, like everyone else, respects and pampers him. The big company can give him resources a startup or smaller companies simply cannot afford.

144988,comment,141898,141898,0,0,connellybarnes,,,"One counterexample to your theory is that if bosses limit autonomy, then large universities should limit autonomy significantly; however, they're generous in autonomy.<p>Now on the theory underlying your essays.<p>If it's barbaric to work, then one should note that it's feasible to stop working immediately, without significant wealth.  It can be done piecewise: many of my friends save up and travel for a year or two, or get schools to pay for their traveling.  Assuming one is investing, and not increasing spending, it will get easier rather than harder to take more and more time off from jobs over the years.  Of course most people shoot themselves in the foot by taking out loans or increasing spending, but that's their problem.<p>If autonomy is important, then why assume startups and develop lots of minor contradictions with autonomy?  Why not assume autonomy, and see where this leads?<p>Given your value set, which seems centered around autonomy and creating/hacking, I can't see why you promote startups as a lone solution rather than promoting a variety of solutions.  For example, living cheaply, moving to cheaper nations, taking years off to travel, only reproducing when one's children need no longer work (so as to make the problem of work globally and locally decrease, rather than increase), working to bring high tech to areas without it (which might give different kinds of autonomy, as well as cheap living), working contract type jobs where taking say six months off isn't a problem, working in journalism in the areas of high tech or art (more traveling, less pay), or working in academia, where the problems with autonomy go away and hence work becomes non-pernicious.<p>Your work with startups is really great, but I think there are lots of other options that are equally consistent with the values of long-term autonomy and creating/hacking.  I don't see that you have any particular duty to present these options, but I do think that hackers should be trying to increase the sphere of jobs known to be consistent with their values, by discussing them publicly.",1206391879

144976,comment,144699,144699,0,0,andr,,,"Some things I figured while working on <a href=""http://thefeelgood.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefeelgood.com</a><p>1) Move as much of the work from MySQL to PHP. Things like joins, sorting, etc. are done in PHP. Your PHP nodes are much easier to scale - just throw in a new server when you need it. It won't fix all your scaling problems, but will give you much more time before you need to scale your MySQL.<p>2) Use memcache for at least the most frequent queries, definitely for everything on the homepage. If invalidation of something gets too hard just use a 10-second expiration or so.<p>2a) To avoid dogpiling memcache, measure your peak rate of hits on the site. Then, rewrite your cache get function like so:<p><pre><code>  if (mt_rand(0,$peakRate) == 1)\n      return false;\n  else\n      // get things from cache\n</code></pre>\n3) Think about separating queries in two steps. The first just fetches a list of IDs based on a certain condition, the second fetches the actual items. Cache both steps, with individual cache entries for each item. Make sure you use multi-get.<p>4) Try to design composite keys instead of autoincrement. For example, for The Feel Good, the post ID is YYYY-MM-DD-U (U = user ID), so just by analyzing the IDs in PHP, I can sort by date, filter future posts (you can schedule posts for tomorrow), analyze user-to-user relationships, etc.<p>5) Don't be afraid to go around the ORM and write SQL by hand, especially for tricky UPDATEs.",1206390991

First one is still operational, but I m not part of it, second one failed after 6 months of hard-work, and now I'm working on Third idea since last few months. There are mainly immigration issues bcoz of which I'm not able to go fulltime, so still continuing with part-time option.<p>During first idea, I was a bachelor, and used to invest more time on business development activities, product planning & management, networking events, mentoring sessions, reading books + blogging. I used to spend daily 3-4 hrs of evenings for this. My co-founders were doing coding. I did this for 1 year. Then bcoz of certain concerns, I left this project and started another.<p>During second idea, I got married, so working in the late evening was not justifiable. I used to work in early morning from 4am-7am, mostly coding and then in the evening, if necessary, meet some potential clients or advisors for business development activities. So daily I used to work for 4-5 hrs. Unfortunately, my other co-founders were married ones, and couldn't cope up with fulltime + mariage + part-time startup pace. So naturally, I was alone at the end, and after certain time, had to close the idea.<p>Now I again started with the third idea. Now I spend maximum time on learning technical stuff, and coding my application. Most of the times, I am the only one on this idea, I'm spending max time on developing product rather than building business, which I did lot in previous startups. I spend daily 2-3 hrs on weekday, and 5-6 hrs on one weekend.<p>In general, I try to put 15-20 hrs a week. Which i know are still very less for a startup :( I think having equally entrepreneurial and passionate co-founders, who are ready to slog hard in the part-time is very essential, which was the case in my first idea.",1206390804

144941,comment,144497,144686,0,0,pg,,,"The situation with reddit is a unique one.  I think I'm\nthe only person who both writes a lot and started a news site.  Not\nsurprisingly, people who like what I write tended to switch to that\nnews site.  The switch was particularly extreme in the case of\nreddit, because News.YC is in a sense an offshoot of reddit: most\npeople who switched from another site to this one came from there.<p>The result is that practically anyone left on reddit who has an\nopinion about me has a bad one.  At this point, I could write an\nessay saying 1 + 1 = 2, and the reddit comment thread would be pretty unanimous that I was mistaken, and moreover, an asshole for saying so.<p>Usually this doesn't effect anything much, but I think you're right that it did in this case.  I exchanged email with Atwood and it seemed clear he'd been influenced by the tone of the reddit thread.<p>I don't think there's anything one could actually do about this\nproblem.  I only mention this because it is so far as I know a novel one.",1206389350

I believe others have already pointed this out, but use of the lion metaphor is not unintentional. Lion is widely recognized as being the ""King of the Jungle"" -- a powerful and virile animal.<p>This is an undue specialization, a form of flattery. If anything, this alone should leave all programmers satisfied, because naturally, not everyone fit this definition or can duly ascribe it to themselves, whether they formed a successful startup or not.<p>A more general ""animals in the jungle/zoo"" might have equally well served to enrage both camps. In that instance, the onus of deciding which animal is being spoken of would lay on each individual -- some of whom would wind up with rather silly characterizations such as: ape, rat, etc.",1206389137

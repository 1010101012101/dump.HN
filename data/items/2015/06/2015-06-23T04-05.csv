9762709,comment,9760140,9762546,0,0,crdb,,,"China is big enough that foreign tourists are but a blip on the radar, despite frequent and cheap flights (I once flew Singapore-Beijing for SGD 17 return on Air Asia). You&#x27;re talking about a place where even second rate &quot;countryside&quot; cities have the population of London or Paris.<p>Venice and other so called &quot;traditional&quot; cities have failed not because of the rush of tourists, but because they have attempted to freeze their prosperity in time. The Venetian Republic once was a world leader in trade, culture and prosperity, and today&#x27;s historical monuments were yesterday&#x27;s cutting edge skyscrapers. &quot;Authenticity&quot; merely represents a people&#x27;s local solutions to the problems of survival and population growth, the cultures that have survived hundreds of years of competition; &quot;foreign&quot; habits are rapidly adapted if they are superior to the local option, which is why you don&#x27;t see many ox carts left in Bali.<p>That Straits &quot;kopi&quot;, the thick, overroasted, sweetened brew you have with kaya toast? It&#x27;s like this because extremely poor Chinese immigrants bought low quality beans, the only ones they could afford, and roasted them with butter and sweetened them with sugar to try and mellow the bad taste. Nobody does it anymore as the region grew economically and coffee beans got comparatively cheaper vs, say, labour costs and real estate. In Vietnam, bicycles have been replaced by mopeds. In Mumbai, motorised autorickshaws have completely replaced the people-drawn ones (which I&#x27;m told still exist in places like Chennai). Does that make both cities less &quot;authentic&quot;?<p>Paris is my favorite example of a city that is so stuck in its past it refuses to acknowledge its own philosophy. Haussmann&#x27;s razing and rebuilding of the entire city had purely modern ambitions: clean up the sewers that most of the badly built streets had become, reduce fire risk, accomodate higher population density, encourage trade via better transport infrastructure, and so on. But Parisians have arbitrarily decided that Hausmannian architecture - which was motivated by practical considerations - is &quot;pretty&quot; and refuse to approve anything that would help make Paris a more modern city (at least outside the Defense, and the Tour Montparnasse), forcing real estate prices through the roof and Parisians to endure hour-long commutes. One side effect is that the city is popular with tourists who can travel in time, of course. But would you rather be a Venetian or a New Yorker?<p>What makes China (and, to be honest, modern Southeast Asia outside the American party towns like Phuket) so fascinating is that it is rapidly opening to the world and attempting to pull several hundred million people into the middle class by any means possible. This, not the pretty grey hutongs or &quot;characteristic&quot; street meat sticks is what makes it an interesting place to see and do business in. In my humble ang moh opinion.",1435035575

9762697,comment,9761821,9762414,0,0,RA_Fisher,,,"Great questions. I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I believe you might be right on 1). When there&#x27;s low variability within each group, a smaller sample size will yield higher statistical power. That&#x27;s why pairing is so popular in clinical studies. However the trick to solving 2) is that you pair and <i>then</i> randomly assign the groups within each pair. I found this great article [1] on the subject. It has an interesting discussion of the history. John Stuart Mill&#x27;s approach was to stamp out heterogeneity however possible (e.g. breeding the differences out of mice). However, Fisher showed that no matter how much you tried to stamp out hetero, it was an uncountable and infinite enumerable list. It says that Fisher made a list of all the possible differences in the tea cups used in his famous Lady Tasting Tea experiment [1, 2]. Fisher&#x27;s contribution was noticing that random assignment could balance out hetero.<p>This article [1] puts it succinctly:<p>&quot;If treatments are randomly assigned, so treatment effects may
be estimated without bias, increasing the sample size and decreasing
the heterogeneity of experimental units have similar
consequences: they reduce the sampling variability of unbiased
estimates.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~rosenbap/heteroReprint.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~rosenbap/heteroReprint.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea</a>",1435035301

9762695,comment,9760164,9762396,0,0,tptacek,,,"The first modern overflow exploit was Thomas Lopatic&#x27;s 1995 HPUX httpd exploit. When he wrote it up, he claimed it followed the blueprint of the &quot;microscope and tweezers&quot; paper Spafford wrote about the Morris worm. The Morris Worm, of course, was from 1988. In the years between 1988 and 1995 there were, so far as anyone knows, a total of zero code-exec buffer overflow exploits.<p>I was in the room with Peiter, at a DC Summercon, as he tried to work out the exploit for Sendmail 8.6.12 that 8lgm had teased. He definitely didn&#x27;t have it before 8lgm, and 8lgm didn&#x27;t have it before Lopatic. Even the virus guys didn&#x27;t have it.<p>It&#x27;s weird to think that nobody put two and two together in, say, 1991 --- there certainly was motivation (that&#x27;s the timing of the Sun-Devil Raids!) and <i>so much vulnerable software</i>.<p>But then, in the late 1990s, people honestly thought they could mitigate overflows by moving buffers from the stack to the heap. Reliable heap exploits were a big deal as late as 2003, when Matt Conover spoke to a packed CanSec room about the Windows Heap, in excruciating detail for over an hour. That&#x27;s close to a decade between Lopatic and mainstream heap exploitation on modern heaps.<p>>shrug<",1435035242

9762622,comment,9761984,9761984,0,0,earljwagner,,,"Graves did some really interesting psychology research by asking undergrads to describe the psychology of a healthy, mature adult human. He had his grad students cluster the essays and they did, initially into self-expressing and self-controlling conceptions. In time, they came to see a specific sequence of levels in which self-expressing conceptions alternated with self-controlling ones. This was taken up by Don Beck and Chris Cowan and further marketed as &quot;Spiral Dynamics&quot;. Ken Wilber then used it as the foundation for some of his work on Integral Psychology.<p>Essentially, (in the Spiral Dynamics&#x27; colors terminology), Red is the &quot;law of jungle&quot;, survival of the fittest. Think Mad Max. Self-expressing. &quot;express now for reward now&quot;<p>Blue is the level of delayed gratification and obeying authority. Think Hammurabi up through to authoritarian societies such as North Korea. Self-controlling - &quot;sacrifice now for (spiritual) reward later&quot;<p>Orange is the scientific revolution and classical liberalism. Basically, individuals can discover natural laws for themselves and choose their economic relations. Martin Luther, Galileo, and Adam Smith through to the ethos of Wall Street. Self-expressing - &quot;express self now calculatedly with little shame or guilt&quot;<p>Green is 60s pluralism and multiculturalism. The basic idea is that we can&#x27;t be truly happy unless we work to support inclusion and opportunity for all. It gives rise to what some criticize as political-correctness and a culture of &quot;taking offense&quot;. Self-controlling - &quot;sacrifice now for peer-approval&quot;<p>Yellow is basically data-driven decision-making, technocracy, authority from expertise, etc. Self-expressing - &quot;express now but not at the expense of others&quot;.<p>Turquoise is after Yellow, and self-controlling, but beyond those facts it&#x27;s widely debated. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is seen as an example of this level of thinker. &quot;sacrifice the idea that one will ever know what it is all about and adjust to this as the existential reality of existence&quot;<p>Graves had been teaching intro to psych and presenting the work of Skinner, Freud, and Rogers and others. When students asked him who was right, however, he was frustrated that had no answer for them. After doing this work, he came to discover that each had a niche in helping an individual transition from one level to the next. Skinner&#x27;s work on conditioning would help an individual learn delayed gratification (red to blue). Freudian psychodynamic therapy could help an individual overcome hangups learned from culture (blue to orange). Sensitivity training could help someone understand others&#x27; perspectives (orange to green). Rogerian client-centered therapy could help an individual go beyond the need for acceptance from their peer group to self-actualization (green to yellow).<p>He had another insight that self-actualization, as it was understood in the 60s and 70s, is probably a process and not a final state. There is no final destination, as there may be levels even beyond turquoise.<p>Graves&#x27; unfinished manuscript summarizing all of this was posthumously published as &quot;The Never Ending Quest&quot;

I just finished it and highly recommend it.<p>My personal take is that these levels represent &quot;paradigms of choice&quot;. They&#x27;re levels of complexity at which you can understand your choices and the choices of others. Individuals at each subsequent level are able to handle greater complexity, and see more options for decisions.",1435033878

Humans adapt to circumstance and use different tools, but I&#x27;d need some convincing to believe our essential nature has _ever_ changed since we first climbed down out of the trees. Tribalism, selfishness, violence, lust, love, superstition and an occasional rare burst of insight and reason.... all still plainly manifest and driving our social world. Look at Nigeria. Look at the local penitentiary. Look at the Mideast. Look at the office politics in your workplace. Same motives, different manifestations. Nothing really changes as long as the condition in which we find ourselves remains the same. And that condition is scarcity and fear of death and pain and jealousy and constant competition from competing tribes. A same organism in the same conditions is likely to act in the same ways. And we do, and we will, at least until we become something else or until these circumstances change for everybody (which dream is very very far away).<p>On the other hand, maybe we are gaining the tools to change our nature through changes in biology/physiology.

But, when you run out of those people, then the choice becomes paying to train them, or suffer the cost of leaving the work they&#x27;d do undone. If the value of the work they perform is more than the cost of training, it&#x27;s logical to train them.<p>In this example, the market rate for someone already trained at a certain set of skills is $90k, and the cost of training is $20k. Nothing prevents a company from offering people who are smart and capable, but not trained at whatever the company happens to need today, $70k. But with a promise (in the employment agreement, not orally) to offer $90k one year from now.<p>Everyone benefits from this arrangement — the candidate, who now has a better job they otherwise would have (which is presumably why they&#x27;re taking the offer in the first place). And the company, who&#x27;s getting a capable employee without spending more on training.<p>So, the bottom line is that you can always structure your incentives in a way that makes the training worthwhile for all parties involved, without asking the employee to pay for it.",1435032239

By time, as westerners get to know it more and more, it will be less relevant and/or fascinating, and contemporaneously rot.

After time, their razors began to hurt and feel like they were pulling hair more than I remember at the beginning. One Saturday I did an A/B test with a store-bought Gillette 5 blade against the DSC ultimate 6 blade. I lathered up and shaved with a brand new DSC blade and it was just a little painful. Brand new Gillette, smooth as silk. I decided that even though the Dollar Shave Club was cheaper (Gillette from a drugstore is 15-20 bucks for refills) I couldn&#x27;t have a painful shave experience. I had my phone in hand to take pics of the experience and thought... hey, I&#x27;ll just cancel right now. I could not find a way to do it. I could only pause my delivery. Finally a couple of months later, I hunted around their website a bit and didn&#x27;t immediately see anything related to &quot;quitting the club&quot;.

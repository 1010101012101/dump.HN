8248735,comment,8247803,8248555,14,0,tunesmith,,,"As a pianist of several years, I don&#x27;t tend to think that chording is a very good idea for fast typing.  Certain chord combinations are never very graceful and are a good recipe for tendon strain.  We learn to avoid certain fingering because of these hand limitations, and part of the reason we can do that easily is because we are generally moving our hands all over the keyboard.  The secret to effective piano playing (to limit strain and tiredness and harm) is honestly the complete opposite of what a lot of computer-keyboard-minimalists seem to be striving for - pianists are supposed to minimize finger movement, and send as much of that movement upstream as possible.  Transfer finger to hand, hand to wrist, wrist to arm, arm to body - limit individual finger activity as much as possible for relaxed playing.  The idea of minimizing computer keyboard keys for having <i>less</i> keys, and putting more responsibility on agile fingers while freezing the hand in one location, seems exactly backward if the goal is for fast, efficient, fluid strain-free typing.",1409471990

Just about every single expense, at the end of the day goes to energy. At the most basic, most fundamental, what else is there to spend money on? Minerals are free - they are just sitting in the ground. The costs is the energy costs of getting them out, not the cost of the mineral itself.<p>Any costs of making something are the costs of the parts, or the machine, or the transportation, etc. Labor costs at the end of the day go to someone buying those items which fundamentally boil down to energy costs.<p>> I would spitball the material costs as effective proxies of input energy costs: Plastic, glass: effectively free Copper 1 kg: $7.00 Aluminum 3 kg: $5.00 Silicon 1 kg: $40.00<p>So where does the rest of the money go? It goes to pay for other energy uses you have not included, that&#x27;s where.<p>> the wholesale value of the power is $200.<p>That&#x27;s worse for you you know.

8248721,comment,8248609,8248609,16,0,bjterry,,,"This article stands in contrast to the thoughts expressed in a recent interview with George Ellis[1]. The question of Bayesian vs. frequentist is fundamentally a philosophical question, and it&#x27;s often discussed in these terms in the articles about the debate, including the recent one which caused this post. The philosophy that we accept affects the tools that we use to solve problems, and the way we think about problems, so you can&#x27;t simply ignore the debate. Ellis&#x27; argument even extends to his example, about Ïˆ (the quantum wave function), about which there is extensive philosophical debate.<p>When people identify as supporting Bayesian methods over frequentist methods, that actually changes the way they perform science. It&#x27;s an argument against bad statistical interpretations that frequently arise in the social sciences and medicine[2] and elsewhere because p-values have become the altar at which all publishing researchers must prostrate themselves. It&#x27;s not a case of a debate without substance, which would have no observable effects.<p>I can understand the frustrations of the author. Every tool has its use, and frequentist statistical methods are frequently useful. They help you get published, they are broadly supported by software packages, they are often faster and easier to perform, etc., so there are many situations in which they are the right choice. But I feel like in attempting to be agnostic about methods, the author is losing nuance in their argument.  Bayesian reasoning really does represent the ground truth (assuming imperfect knowledge), and even when we are using frequentist methods, we are only doing so because the benefits outweigh the costs.<p>1: <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2014/08/21/quantum-gravity-expert-says-philosophical-superficiality-has-harmed-physics/?-k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2014/08/21/q...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/prior-probability-the-dirty-little-secret-of-evidence-based-alternative-medicine-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/prior-probability-the-di...</a>",1409471669

The sunlight doesn&#x27;t have to be directly incident to generate power, and 10 hours is a perfectly fine estimate, thank you. If anything, it&#x27;s conservative, like every number I used.<p>You are pulling the 10 years number right out of your rear end. Many people on old-generation panels are doing 75-80% (above projection) on 25 year old panels. In fact, most panels today are warrantied to 60-80% of nameplate capacity in straight line degradation to 25 years.<p>Your $.15 power is retail, not wholesale which would be $.02. The $500 installed is also retail, not wholesale. And it is a ROI calculation at that point, not EROEI. I seriously doubt the $500/panel price has any relation whatsoever to the energy requirements to produce a single panel. And I seriously doubt the financial ROE of current panels has any relation to the scaled out EROEI of solar PV infra in the future.<p>I would spitball the material costs as effective proxies of input energy costs:\nPlastic, glass: effectively free\nCopper 1 kg: $7.00\nAluminum 3 kg: $5.00\nSilicon 1 kg: $40.00<p>Now, just randomly cutting my original estimate to 10mWh to humor you and the correct wholesale electricity price of $.02/kWh, the wholesale value of the power is $200.

You have managed to get away from complete naivete, you think using abstract concepts, which allows you to look through the superficial appearance of things, and thus cut through a lot of bullshit. But you haven&#x27;t noticed yet that your abstractions are way too abstract to give a reliable representation of the real world by themselves, that abstractions are just helpful thinking tools, but not the full truth - and that because of that your way of thinking produces about as much bullshit as it cuts through, just of a different kind.<p>In particular, it&#x27;s seldom helpful to cling to specific terms and their supposed definitions rather than look at the actual facts. Who cares whether doctors are slaves? Is there anyone who has any actual disadvantages due to how the system works or not? If everyone, including the doctors, is better off with how the system works, who cares whether they are slaves by some definition? If they have some disadvantages, then that should be addressed, who cares whether it fulfills the criteria for being a slave?<p>Also, you always have to consider the wider societal context. There might be indirect benefits outside the immediate transactions that arise from how a society is constructed. Where I live, for example, if you see someone in distress and there is no significant danger to you if you were to rescue them, and you are able to, it is a criminal offense not to help.

For sake of clarification, to me it ""goes without saying"" (which is why I didn't say it) that people who are more touchy-feely are also highly likely to be the type to lie (say nice things) to your face while stabbing you in the back.  Both things tend to be rooted in or related to a dislike of confrontation.  People who place an inordinately high value on the (superficially) feel-good experience are, obviously (at least to me), the same type that will make nice while doing you serious harm.  Can't have people (ie THEMSELVES) be uncomfortable while we burn them, now can we?<p>And if you got that the first time:  nevermind. :)",1279465143

You just have to intelligently optimize your GPA (I wrote about optimization a bit here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1132222"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1132222</a>). If you take this approach, the challenge is no longer getting offered a job, but getting the interview in the first place. I've been offered a job for every interview I've had, but damn did I have to work hard to get my foot in the door. Once you DO get your foot in the door, you're pretty much guaranteed the job because your risk taking puts you many technical miles ahead of the competition. I hope (but have no empirical evidence yet) that the same effect will be true when applying to graduate school. Just use your ingenuity to get around the screening process. :)<p>EDIT: One last thing I thought of. You may be one of those people that will be able to get a 4.0 GPA <i>and</i> have time to work on creative processes. Your 4.0 GPA is still a waste of time. There is always more you can do that is ultimately more impressive than a high GPA (i.e. publishing in competitive conferences, starting a highly technical and useful open source project, working on the Linux/BSD kernel, etc).",1279464759

1525838,comment,1525587,1525587,0,0,Mz,,,"I don't know what the answer to problems like this is but I have spent a fair amount of time studying (both formally and informally) issues like poverty and pondering how to effectively address really thorny problems.  I have concluded that government programs designed ""to help the poor"" generally do more harm than good.  Part of the problem is with a) requiring recipients to psychologically identify themselves as ""the poor"" and b) the fact that the very design of such programs tends to reward people for having problems and punish them for trying to resolve their problems.  A chief example is Welfare which was designed to ""help poor single mothers"".  It was designed when most poor, single mothers were people we would classify as ""the deserving poor"":  widows.  But the way it was designed changed the social contract and actively encouraged women to choose to become poor, single moms in order to qualify for assistance.  The result:  Welfare actively grew the population of poor, single moms.  Not remotely the original intent.<p>So I have concluded that if you REALLY want to ""help the poor"", you have to start by removing ""poor"" from your program definition and qualifying requirements.  Instead, ask yourself: what would help the people generally and do so in such a way that, coincidentally, poor people would benefit significantly?  For example, countries that help parents generally, regardless of marital status or income, seem to get better results than the American Welfare system.",1279464390

1525806,comment,1525587,1525587,0,0,ronnier,,,"This is a long article, here are some of the key points.<p>...<p>Crime rates in large cities stayed flat, homicide rates in many midsize cities (with populations of between 500,000 and 1 million) began increasing, sometimes by as much as 20percent a year.<p>...<p>The demolition of the city’s public-housing projects, as part of a nationwide experiment to free the poor from the destructive effects of concentrated poverty. Memphis demolished its first project in 1997. The city gave former residents federal “Section8” rent-subsidy vouchers and encouraged them to move out to new neighborhoods. Two more waves of demolition followed over the next nine years, dispersing tens of thousands of poor people into the wider metro community.<p>...<p>In 1976, letters went out to 200 randomly selected families among the 44,000 living in Chicago public housing, asking whether they wanted to move out to the suburbs. A counselor went around the projects explaining the new Section8 program, in which tenants would pay 25percent of their income for rent and the government would pay the rest, up to a certain limit.<p>...<p>Starting in 1977, in what became known as the Gautreaux program, hundreds of families relocated to suburban neighborhoods—most of them about 25miles from the ghetto, with very low poverty rates and good public schools.<p>...<p>Cisneros floated the idea of knocking down the projects and moving the residents out into the metro area.<p>The federal government encouraged the demolitions with a $6.3billion program to redevelop the old project sites, called HOPE VI, or “Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere.” The program was launched in the same spirit as Bill Clinton’s national service initiative—communities working together to “rebuild lives.” One Chicago housing official mused about “architects and lawyers and bus drivers and people on welfare living together.”<p>...<p>In the most literal sense, the national effort to diffuse poverty has succeeded. Since 1990, the number of Americans living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty—meaning that at least 40 percent of households are below the federal poverty level—has declined by 24percent. But this doesn’t tell the whole story.<p>...<p>George Galster, of Wayne State University, analyzed the shifts in urban poverty and published his results in a paper called “A Cautionary Tale.” While fewer Americans live in high-poverty neighborhoods, increasing numbers now live in places with “moderate” poverty rates, meaning rates of 20 to 40 percent.<p>...<p>In 2003, the Brookings Institution published a list of the 15 cities where the number of high-poverty neighborhoods had declined the most. In recent years, most of those cities have also shown up as among the most violent in the U.S., according to FBI data.<p>...<p>The University of Louisville criminologist Geetha Suresh was tracking local patterns of violent crime. She had just arrived from India, had never heard of a housing project.  Suresh noticed a recurring pattern, A particularly violent neighborhood would suddenly go cold, and crime would heat up in several new neighborhoods. In each case, Suresh has now confirmed, the first hot spots were the neighborhoods around huge housing projects, and the later ones were places where people had moved when the projects were torn down. From that, she drew the obvious conclusion: “Crime is going along with them.”<p>...<p>In some places, the phenomenon is hard to detect, but there may be a simple reason: in cities with tight housing markets, Section8 recipients generally can’t afford to live within the city limits, and sometimes they even move to different states. New York, where the rate of violent crime has plummeted, appears to have pushed many of its poor out to New Jersey, where violent crime has increased in nearby cities and suburbs. Washington, D.C., has exported some of its crime to surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia.<p>...<p>In 2005, another wave of project demolitions pushed the number of people displaced from public housing to well over 20,000, and crime skyrocketed.<p>...<p>If replacing housing projects with vouchers had achieved its main goal—infusing the poor with middle-class habits—then higher crime rates might be a price worth paying. But today, social scientists looking back on the whole grand experiment are apt to use words like baffling  and disappointing.<p>...<p>a follow-up to the highly positive, highly publicized Gautreaux study of 1991—produced results that were “puzzling,” said Susan Popkin of the Urban Institute. In this study, volunteers were also moved into low-poverty neighborhoods, although they didn’t move nearly as far as the Gautreaux families. Women reported lower levels of obesity and depression. But they were no more likely to find jobs. The schools were not much better, and children were no more likely to stay in them. Girls were less likely to engage in risky behaviors, and they reported feeling more secure in their new neighborhoods. But boys were as likely to do drugs and act out, and more likely to get arrested for property crimes. The best Popkin can say is: “It has not lived up to its promise. It has not lifted people out of poverty, it has not made them self-sufficient, and it has left a lot of people behind.”",1279463098

One way to do this would be to have a two tier system were readers can read the news as usual, but if you want to get access to the source materials and editorial decisions used to assemble the stories, or to be able to see the journalists at work (for example validating source material), you might pay a subscription.

They aren't corrupted into placing friends, family & allies in government positions, that how systems work and it's exactly what is expected of them. Filing to appoint a powerful ally might result in the weakening of the alliance and instability in the kingdom.<p>Similarly, capitalism doesn't have to worry about the corruption of greedy individuals out to make money for themselves without regard for the greater scheme, this is how the system works. If people didn't follow their own desire for personal prosperity, nothing would be produced.<p>Saudi Arabia is not a good example for anything though. The country itself (IE, the land) produces the wealth pretty much autonomously. The people do not have to be productive for the monarchy to have wealth. All government needs to do is provide government services and ensure stability. They don't have to be all that efficient because they can afford to do things the costly way. In other monarchies (EG, neighbouring Jordan) the people have to make the wealth. This creates a completely different dynamic.",1279462313

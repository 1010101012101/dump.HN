The article look to be a long one, and if I just committed to reading every long article on the internet I&#x27;d never get anything done.   \nThe beginning of the article should serve to get me interested and willing to invest the time to read the article, not as a snark remark to people who have already showed interest in your article by navigating to it.  In the case that this is a reply to people asking for TL;DR on things you write:  A tl;dr means that someone was interested  in what you had to say enough to leave a comment.  However you failed to show the worth of reading the article given the apparent size of it.  You had the potential to get those who would start reading your article to see if it had value and told all of them to go waste their time.",1376071193

As you pointed out:<p>>The first rule of any educator is to never, under any circumstances, make someone feel inept. And it was so easily avoidable here.<p>There are many sentences in this article indicating that this is not an isolated, unique reaction from the poster.<p>This paragraph especially irked me:<p>> Ive messed up, as Im sure many of you have. When we purchased an XBox it was Techno-Dad to the rescue. I happily played about with the mess of cables and then created profiles for everyone. When my sons MacBook was infected with the FlashBack virus Techno-Dad to the rescue. I looked up some on-line guides and then hammered away in the terminal until I had eradicated that bad-boy. When we purchased a Family Raspberry Pi Techno-Dad to the rescue. I hooked it all up, flashed an OS to the SD-card and then sat back proudly, wondering why nobody other than me wanted to use the blasted thing. All through their lives, Ive done it for them. Set-up new hardware, installed new software and acted as in-house technician whenever things went wrong. As a result, I have a family of digital illiterates.<p>Well, maybe it shouldn&#x27;t have been &quot;techno dad to the rescue&quot;, but rather &quot;dad spending a moment with his kids showing them how to setup a raspberry pi/their xbox/etc.&quot;. And if the kids aren&#x27;t even interested in setting up their own XBox, well then that&#x27;s their prerogative. Give a man a fish, etc.<p><i>Addendum:</i> when I was a pre-teen/teen, I spent all my free time learning about computers, reading programming books, etc. There was another kid just like me whom I hung out with, but it was just the two of us in our entire school. Nowadays, when I teach I meet kids who know python/html/php, fiddle with minecraft mods, jailbreak their android tablet so they can run a GBA emulator, etc. all the time.

It&#x27;s that they can&#x27;t THINK.</i><p>I find it&#x27;s more specific than and not as serious as that.  I got my first computer in 1982, first modem in 1985 (hence my username).  I find that people who proudly state how not-technical they are actually purposely turn their brain off around computers.  It&#x27;s not that they can&#x27;t think.  They can and often do around non-technical things.  But they automatically assume they&#x27;re unable to fix anything computer-related so they don&#x27;t even try.  My wife is a perfect example of that.  If I hear, &quot;Printer is not working&quot; again I think I&#x27;m going to throw it out the window.

6187146,comment,6186473,6186473,6,0,stephengillie,,,"Laser distance meters have been available to contractors for years. The major difference Senic adds, over Ryobi, Bosch & Fluke, is bluetooth & cloud syncing.<p>I have always wondered how these devices actually calculate distances. I have experimented with Arduino & Parallax, and I&#x27;ve seen how the resolution of an ultrasonic distance sensor is directly affected by the processor speed -- the processor is merely counting the fractions of a second between sending the ping pulse, and receiving its echo. But a 1 MHz processor can only just count milliseconds. A 16 MHz processor can count only slightly faster. At the room-temperature speed of sound, this gives you a resolution of about 1/29th of an inch, or 1/74th of a centimeter.<p>In theory, the same should be possible with light -- send a light pulse then count the fractions of a second for it to return. Thinking back to Grace Hopper&#x27;s Nanosecond [1], a 1mhz processor would have a resolution of hundreds of feet. So these must be using a very small, simple, multi-GHz processor to get a resolution of about 2/15 of an inch.<p>Unless these devices do their measurement in a completely different way...<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsKnWZrJ8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsKnWZrJ8</a>",1376070876

One day I&#x27;m going to write an Excel spreadsheet VB macro, and your whole department is out of a job. One day somebody will release YourJobaaService and then you are useless. And because you spent your life becoming a technician, you won&#x27;t be able to enjoy your newfound free time, because you can&#x27;t do anything other than blithely consume the content others have created.<p><pre><code>  People still treat computers as new things.\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ve had personal computers for nigh-on three or four decades now, and the fact that they&#x27;re still treated in popular culture as magic black boxes is a failing on our part as techies for not educating better the rest of the population. We probably did it to curry favor, to enjoy the power of knowing something they didn&#x27;t, but damned if it isn&#x27;t going to bite us in the end.<p>As the author deftly points out, these folks are going to become our political leaders--and however little we think of their policies in regards to technology, they&#x27;ll be that way because we failed to impress on them the knowledge that they needed. For anyone who&#x27;s been paying attention to the darker subtext of the PRISM scandal, you can draw the uncomfortable conclusion that the government is saying: &quot;Hey, tech sector, guess what--the halcyon days of your industry ignoring us are over.

I&#x27;m the author of the docs/videos (a koding user, not staff), who is obviously a bit passionate about the platform.<p>I know i had no trouble &quot;Getting&quot; Koding, but that is because remote development is something i&#x27;ve been using/toying with for three or four years now. Originally it was heavy SSH, and focusing on trying to create VIM IDEs and improve a terminal oriented workflow so that it can all work through SSH, but eventually i learned about some of these Online Dev Environments. I used Cloud9 for about a year, before switching to Koding about a year ago. The point being, i&#x27;ve wanted this remote-environment concept for such a long time, it sort of comes naturally to me.<p>I imagine if you&#x27;re very used to working locally, you have a hard time seeing the advantages of using a remote platform. I can understand, it&#x27;s a very new tech, and it&#x27;s not the next coming of Christ or anything. I got a bit overzealous with the &quot;unlimited possibilities&quot; line lol, but i have made an issue on the matter and plan on rewording that.<p>With all that said, i do strongly disagree that &quot;Apparently the Koding team doesn&#x27;t know either.&quot;. You&#x27;re taking a beta product, with an obviously large list of features that aren&#x27;t implemented, and saying that the devs don&#x27;t know what the product is good for. It obviously has a roadmap, both with visible and non-visible features planned, so i think the devs have a good idea where they are headed with it.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect of course, but online development is quite new. After being a user of many of these platforms, i chose Koding, so obviously i feel it&#x27;s &quot;the best&quot;. I am obviously biased because i have picked this platform as my platform of choice, but with the warning i hope you won&#x27;t hold this against me.<p>Anyway, you can read my other posts which talk about how my docs project, and especially my &quot;2 minute Koding&quot; video, are not pitches to use Koding. They are for Koding users mostly, people who have already decided on the platform. These are things i, as a user, wanted to give to the community and hopefully foster an environment that i want to feel. Communities are what you make of them, and i am trying my part.<p>I respect your opinion nonetheless, and i&#x27;m sure the devs are taking what you say to heart. I hope i can improve the Overview as well, based on the feedback. :)",1376070619

Karp experienced a unique set of circumstances beyond his control (as each of us do) and none of his life experiences prevented him from reaching this payout (extremely lucky).<p>No doubt, his success and achievements suggest he is smart, hardworking, dedicated, etc. But another person, twice as smart, twice as hardworking, twice as dedicated, is affected daily by a totally different series of external events beyond his control, any one of which might preclude him from realizing the scenario where he gets a $180M payout.<p>And, some people <i>choose</i> paths in science/engineering/software/anything that preclude the possibility of a $180M payout. The researcher toiling in a lab to push forward the boundaries of human knowledge and achievement is most likely going to earn a modest salary his entire life (modest, at least, relative to Karp&#x27;s). Is he worse in any way because he didn&#x27;t create a microblogging platform that existed at the right place at the right time? Of course not.",1376070336

They don&#x27;t understand them particularly well, but they don&#x27;t struggle to understand them either. They rise to a level with the problems that they want to use the system to address and then... their understanding is adequate until something goes wrong.<p>What possible motivation would they have to learn more? Okay, they might use a computer in their job - but inefficiency there is often their employer&#x27;s problem, and considering you can&#x27;t run arbitrary code on most companies systems (their IT policy generally excludes this) they benefit nothing from learning a programming language.<p>What does that leave them with? A games machine perhaps, a glorified typewriter with some telecoms capabilities to all intents and purposes.<p>The concept of computers as a general tool simply does not exist to many people.

It was about how some police agencies are starting to us <i>counter-insurgency</i> techniques in an effort to control gangs in the cities. Many of those advocating are former soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan eager to apply lessons learned.<p>Good COIN is as much a PR game as anything, and to the degree that the police make friends and help out the local citizenry by going out of their way to be friendly, that&#x27;s a great thing. But at the end of the segment, it showed a bust on a couple of small time drug dealers. A bread truck pulls up, and out pops a team of guys armed for a firefight: tactical vests, boots, helmets, night-vision, assault rifles. Looked like part of a badly-orchestrated marine amphibious landing.<p>I love the idea of community policing. Get the cops outta the cars and walking around. But after 9-11 we&#x27;re turning police departments nationwide into clubs for retired and wannabe assault troops. Policing is dangerous specifically because you&#x27;re supposed to be one of the community. The second you switch into an &quot;us versus them&quot; attitude, or start thinking &quot;I&#x27;ll do anything necessary to make sure I make it home safely tonight&quot; then you&#x27;re violating the public trust. Cops are the guys walking up to traffic stops carrying nothing but a holstered pistol and facing god knows what. They&#x27;re not just another armed gang out to control public opinion by showing off their cool toys and weapons.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between good COIN and good policing. I think we&#x27;ve forgotten that. Same goes for the difference between good close quarters combat and good COIN.<p>I also have a simple question: if SWAT stands for Special Weapons and Tactics, then what&#x27;s so special about it when you&#x27;re using it tens of thousands of times a year? It&#x27;s just <i>SOP</i> Weapons and Tactics. That&#x27;s whacked.<p>I wonder where the hell the politicians are in all of this and what happened to our country&#x27;s mores. It used to be that police who took their job so seriously they wanted to act like paratroopers were ridiculed by the community, many of whom were just as trained as the cops were in the organized use of lethal force. Now we&#x27;ve created a system where only a very few folks get combat training in the military and then automatically filter into jobs where such training can be &quot;transferred&quot; Meanwhile the community, including the judges and politicians, are too afraid of being the guy who caused the next terrorist attack and too ignorant of what techniques are actually necessary to perform the role of supervisor.<p>The 60 Minutes reporter was very impressed by all of this anti-gang activity. You can tell a lot by the kinds of fluff pieces the media runs, and it&#x27;s a bad spot we&#x27;ve gotten into.",1376069195

The advantage of osteopathic manipulative medicine was a diminution of adverse drug reactions while the disadvantage was the greater amount of physician time required for each patient.[22]</i><p><i>A 2005 meta-analysis and systematic review of six randomized controlled trials of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) that involved blinded assessments of lower back pain in ambulatory settings concluded that OMT significantly reduces low back pain, and that the level of pain reduction is greater than expected from placebo effects alone and persists for at least three months.[23]</i><p><i>The National Institutes of Health&#x27;s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine states[24] that overall, studies have shown that spinal manipulation can provide mild to moderate relief from low-back pain and appears to be as effective as conventional medical treatments.</i><p>You are the worst kind of debater.

So I developed an application as MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and gonne out and spoken to a couple of potential customers. The application is a basic income and expense tracking system with invoice in its center. And with my meeting with potential customers I have already found people who are willing to use the system for free with a promise to find me 2 future paying customers each. According to the promise, the future customers would pay me 2500Birr (i.e 125USD). \nThese were super awesome deals to me, if I get 2 paying customers for my applications I will end up owning 250USD, and that is my salary. I was feeling happy already until I started reading HN, reddit programmer and other success stories in internet. I was constantly reading about these amazing pricing schemes, and how I could easily not just get that amount once but make it my monthly income. \nBut to my frustration we dont have any kind of online currency in the whole country here in Ethiopia so I have to resort to my original idea as these all making online stories seem a fairy tale to me.

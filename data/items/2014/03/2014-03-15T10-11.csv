After not to long I figured out it was caused because of the leap year and his logic did not account for leap years. So I called them back and told them it would fix its self by tomorrow. I never actually bothered to fix the bug because a) I thought it was unlikely that the pos system would still be used in 4 years and b) the code was so bad in all areas that trying to fix anything had a good chance of breaking something else.<p>Lets just say that job was very character building",1394881107

You can of course go cheaper if you rent a larger house with room mates (which in fact many people do). Food prices are outrageous, expect to pay at least $10 per person per meal if you go out to eat, $15 is more common.<p>But this page also doesn&#x27;t mention any of the quality of life benefits of living in Redmond.<p>For one thing, crime is almost non-existent. Police vehicles regularly patrol the area 24/7. There is no noise, no one partying outside, no cars driving around blasting music, none of that.<p>And the city is maintained in an almost pristine state. The roads are damn near perfect. Pot holes are fixed within a week, if not days. City services are all around amazing, heck even the police are polite and a delight to deal with.<p>The commute to work is excellent. From out my door to into the work parking lot is about 5 minutes.<p>Direct access to Seattle, 15 minutes to downtown Seattle during non-rush hours.<p>And finally, the math in this Article is so bonkers, it seems like it&#x27;d apply to almost any major city. Rent in a &quot;won&#x27;t be stabbed&quot; part of Seattle is higher than it is in Redmond. Rent in NYC or SF for a comparable quality of life is going to be much higher! (Can you even rent a place in SF proper that in in a neighborhood with virtually no crime?)<p>Perhaps my main complaint about living here is the scarcity of restaurants that deliver!",1394880834

King was fortunate to seize upon an entire network build-up behind a cause and behind him over many years. The punishments he faced by breaking segregation laws are gentle in comparison to the brand of &quot;justice&quot; and punishment Snowden is likely facing in his &quot;homeland.&quot; One might imagine the likes of King, Mandela, and so on, recognizing this new face of oppression as did King did against the industry of military and against a government that&#x27;s willing and eager to invade Vietnam and obliterate the Vietnamese under the mirage of virtue.

I&#x27;m in the same situation as you so I can kind of relate. It&#x27;s hard to try building a technological start-up especially when you are not that adept. There are three things you should work on which is your creativity, networking, and convincing power. First, you need to empower your creative side because it is only that side of you that can really come up with great ideas. And you thinking about creating things that can solve problems, you&#x27;ve already made the first step into creating something that&#x27;s truly great. Think outside the box, I always say. Second, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t really know how to start it, everything&#x27;s uncertain at this point. That&#x27;s why you have to network and find the people who can help you in the parts where you&#x27;re weak at. You need to find people who can really help build your ideas because an idea no matter how great cannot be built by just one man, no matter how smart you are. Focus on your strengths, right now everything is uncertain. Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle, the more pieces you put in, the clearer the picture gets. It&#x27;s like that in starting a business, the more people you work with the clearer it gets. Third, work on your communication skills. No matter who you are, whether you&#x27;re trying to build the next generation computer like Steve Jobs or trying to create an artistic masterpiece like Andy Warhol, you need to be able to convince people that what you&#x27;re trying to create is the next big thing. You&#x27;re gonna get a lot of rejections, that&#x27;s a fact of life.

The study naming Singapore as the most expensive city come from the Economist Intelligence Unit&#x27;s Worldwide Cost of Living Index, which is supposed to &quot;help human resources and finance managers calculate cost-of-living allowances and build compensation packages for expatriates and business travellers&quot; and is &quot;based on the assumption that an expatriate has a right to live at the assignment site in the same manner and with the same kind of goods and services he would find at home&quot; (source: <a href=""https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=Wcol2014"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=Wc...</a>, <a href=""http://www.worldwidecostofliving.com/asp/wcol_HelpWhatIsWCOL.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldwidecostofliving.com/asp/wcol_HelpWhatIsWCOL...</a>).<p>In other words, it&#x27;s comparing the price of living a Western executive lifestyle, not the cost of living for a regular person. Transport costs are high because Singapore has very high taxes on cars (more expensive than the cost of the car itself) - the target audience isn&#x27;t going to be using a bus pass. Food costs are based on prices at high-end Western restaurants, not $5 worth of groceries. The housing comparison definitely isn&#x27;t based on a studio apartment.

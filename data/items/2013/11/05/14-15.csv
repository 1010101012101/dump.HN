6675360,comment,6674375,6674375,1,0,junto,,,"I have previously thought about a similar idea, where we have a standard for a social media stream. People can pick lots of different social media hosting companies. You tap in your social media updates and your hosting company hosts that stream.<p>You tell your friends your social media URL and they add it to their social media client. If your browser had a client, then it would be responsible for merging all of those feeds into one news feed (just like Facebook&#x27;s). The important thing here is that everything can be decentralized. It is a bit like merged RSS feeds.<p>Of course a majority of people would hand that responsibility over to a social media hosting company (such as Facebook), but if you really wanted to, you could write your own client, or hook it directly into your website.<p>Everything would be secure by default.",1383663591

To me it&#x27;d be sort of weird to have a life that is made up of nothing but 1) paid work; 2) fun/relaxation/leisure; and 3) sleep. I like to do some productive things for myself, as opposed to saving all my productivity for an employer.<p>To me, at least, part of the satisfaction of being a regular adult is that I take care of myself to some extent. I can&#x27;t do everything of course (e.g., I&#x27;m no doctor), but I usually cook, clean up after myself, do laundry, sort my recyclables, sew on buttons, the usual stuff. Cooking in particular I like to do, partly because I get better at it, which means I can do things like cook for friends, and partly because I understand food better by doing it.<p>I tend to hire people for things that are non-routine and where a specialized professional seems like they&#x27;d be much better. For example I do have someone come and clean a few times a year, because while I can generally keep things reasonably clean, a professional cleaner does it to another level. And of course I eat out sometimes, and have professionals do home repairs (that&#x27;s one area people traditionally knew more about that I know virtually nothing about... I can barely use a hammer).",1383663188

There&#x27;s a wearing down effect that poverty has. Over time one can rely quite a bit on past wealth - for example clothing starts wearing out after a year (shoes) but can last decades depending on wear. [estimated periods:] A house needs re-roofing in 20 years, a boiler needs replacing in 10 years, a car needs replacing when it&#x27;s 15 years old, et cetera.<p>It&#x27;s quite easy to live on a low income for a shorter period. In 6 months you&#x27;re still using all the things you had when you were better off - probably you still have some foodstuffs. Coming the other direction in 6 months of higher income you&#x27;d still be spending on those things that have worn out.<p>The $15k for 6 months would make a dramatic change, IMO, but not necessarily one that a casual observer would notice. As an example, I would probably still be wearing worn out clothes but the house would be in a good state of repair, we&#x27;d have a fully working cooker and washing machine, etc..<p>><i>we shouldn&#x27;t care how much money anybody makes, but whether they live a comfortable, happy life and have access to opportunity</i> //<p>Yes, amen.",1383663078

Probably but I don&#x27;t care to make that investment of time.&quot;<p>I would take minor issue with that advice because &quot;we&quot; live in a downwardly mobile society where the median is poorer every year, and upward economic mobility is immensely less likely than downward economic mobility.  Its much easier to learn how to change your oil when you can trivially afford substantial backup labor from tow drivers and pro mechanics if it all goes bad, up to and including simply buying another car, than trying to learn how to change your oil after you&#x27;ve been downsized and ageism means you&#x27;ll never work above $10/hr again, medical induced bankruptcy and job loss, etc etc.  Also its easier to learn &quot;poor people skills&quot; at 25 than 50 or 75.<p>Yes, yes, it only happens to other people, not people like me, or us, because I / we are special.  Sure.  Culturally, poor americans consider themselves merely temporarily inconvenienced millionaires.  Anyway, learning/maintaining skills is exactly like buying insurance when you might need those skills.<p>There is also an aspect of management where learning/maintaining skills makes you a better consumer.  How do you intend to manage your relationship with your mechanic if you intentionally have no idea what you&#x27;ve hired him to do for you?  Oddly enough business relationships based on unidirectional blind trust never work out very fairly.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you have to do everything.  Last time my thermostat failed (open, thankfully) I learned how to replace it and whats involved and basically threw away $200 on labor to have a mechanic do it, because I can easily afford it and there was no way I&#x27;m doing this in six inches of snow and slush in February.  If I couldn&#x27;t afford to throw around $200 like pocket change, and maybe some time in the future I won&#x27;t be able to, I could have done it.  May have ended up with frostbite or pneumonia but I could have done it.  On a nice sunny 70 degree day in May I&#x27;d probably have done it myself for fun.",1383662986

Why work on something that will forever suck and not be a competitor, and can&#x27;t implement the full list of features because we don&#x27;t have the giant budget of our non-free competitor?<p>But then I remember that people are typically more flexible than they appear to be when they write these lists, and you&#x27;ll discover that they may do without some of the features that they list, at least in some circumstances. And that there exist many other people with different lists of sine qua nons who will use the free as in freedom alternative you&#x27;re working on because they have different needs.<p>So, to the OpenNote developers and to anyone else implementing a FAIF replacement I say this: don&#x27;t let these giant lists of features and suggestions about how you&#x27;ll never be competitive grind you down. There are many people out there who will appreciate your work, sometimes even the people who compiled these lists. Look at the lists, see what you can implement, and don&#x27;t be disheartened by the parts that seem impossible to implement.

You don&#x27;t have to install (or even know the URL of) a web app! Mozilla may get there eventually, but they&#x27;re not going to travel the obvious, NSA-(or plug in your favorite bad actor-)vulnerable way.

As an ideologue, you have projected onto my statements a position that you want to argue with. To say that the government never relinquishes power is a statement of ideology, not fact. The Supreme Court, a branch of the government, has taken away government power to regulate political donations to PACs, and decided that certain state governments are not beholden to the federal government while modifying voting policies. There are two examples. Repeal of Glass-Steagall is a congressional example. Federalist political movements only make sense in the context of reform to shrink the power of the federal government.<p>&quot;any implication that the government is hugely understaffed and desperately needs to grow larger is an ideological claim I&#x27;ll dispute.&quot;<p>This is only an ideological position if you view the rule of law as a ideology. I guess it is, but it&#x27;s the foundation of civilization, so it shouldn&#x27;t be controversial. If the government passes laws, it should enforce them. Currently it doesn&#x27;t have the staff to enforce passed laws. That is a statement of fact.

If it&#x27;s because you subjectively place $100 value on that hour of doing nothing, then that&#x27;s fine, and it&#x27;s true that you should in that case pay someone to do the hour of work. But if it&#x27;s because you earn $100/hour when you&#x27;re working, and therefore infer that your time is generally worth $100/hr, that is a somewhat questionable inference unless you are actually going to do paid work in that hour, i.e. you will actually incur an opportunity cost of $100 by mowing your lawn instead of doing an hour of contract work.<p>If it&#x27;s not displacing paid work, then it becomes a matter of subjective valuation of your time, which depends not only on the time, but the task and what you would do instead. In that case, <i>you</i> really have to place a subjective value on how much you like or dislike mowing the lawn, and how much you like or dislike what you would do instead. Since you&#x27;re just displacing one kind of unpaid time for another kind of unpaid time, there&#x27;s no objective economic basis for determining what the delta value between &quot;sitting in a chair&quot; and &quot;mowing the lawn&quot; is.

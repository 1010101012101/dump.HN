I&#x27;ve always thought some form an ultra free market oriented society <i>could</i> work. But...<p>1: The first problems I wonder about is that the system is relying on individuals to be making actively intelligent decisions. How convinced are you of intelligence of the medium person? For power not to concentrate into too few hands, a large percentage of the population has to actively react to shifts in wealth, morality and power. I&#x27;m hesitate to declare this would work.<p>2: Can a free market naturally produce a safety net? Maybe. It is likely in order for society to function in a healthy manner one would need something to help the down and out. Shit happens, life isn&#x27;t fair, bad decisions need help being corrected. I think it is more likely a government would have to provide some of this net. I&#x27;ve always thought creating a &#x27;human right&#x27; to a basic income (say you get $5000 a year no matter what) paired with an ultra free market society would be interesting. Would it be the best? Idk. But it would certainly be interesting to <i>try</i>. (I think Hayek said something vaguely similar)<p>3: Tragedy of the commons. We aren&#x27;t trapped as a species to forever repeat destroying the commons. But it sure as hell happens a lot. Pollution much like crime needs a government force to reign it in. There is no market solution to it. Something like a park system is likely similar.<p>But overall, as a planetary body of people, I think we&#x27;re due to trying something new soon. We&#x27;ve spent the last 100 years or so converting most places to mixed-economy democracy. We should probably start to try other interesting systems. Kind of like what Denmark is doing. They are going in the other direction completely, but it is interesting. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Denmark"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Denmark</a>",1371498545

He may even have had access to the same tools the auditors used so that he could run them himself and see what they flagged and didn&#x27;t flag.<p>It is my experience that systems auditors rely heavily on sysadmins to do their jobs.  At a minimum the auditors are &quot;just&quot; another set of users and the sysadmins&#x27; responsibilities include supporting the auditors even more closely than they support regular users of classified systems.  Frequently the auditors themselves do not have systems-level knowledge of the computers they are auditing.<p>Security on every classified system that I&#x27;ve seen was generally limited to a series of a checklists that some talented specialists once put down in a manual and are left to low-skilled employees to check off each day/week/month - if it isn&#x27;t specifically on the checklist they have little to no knowledge of it.

In other words, politically induced scarcity benefiting wealthy landowners at the cost to those people wishing to buy housing, to rent an apartment, or to run a business is the cause for rising housing prices.<p>The answer is deregulating the politically induced scarcity of land use.  The politically induced scarcity interferes with the market efficiency that would otherwise allow the housing to be more affordable.<p>This is a basic principle of microeconomics and was initially explained by David Ricardo when he explained that the Corn Laws that restricted the import of corn into Britain benefited landowners because it artificially increased the cost of corn thus making the cost of land more scarce and expensive.<p>David Ricardo felt so strongly about this that he joined Parliament to overturn the Corn Laws.  Similarly the solution today is to deregulate the overly restrictive zoning and building code regulations that cause the scarcity.<p>Economist (and FT columnist) Tim Harford explains this in more detail in his book, &quot;The Undercover Economist.&quot;",1371497988

As you point out, I&#x27;ve met Bob, I trust Bob and Bob&#x27;s an old friend. I know Bob&#x27;s cryptographic identity, but I also know that identity could be compromised at any time. However, if I know Bob I&#x27;m much more likely to realize that.<p>The reputation system tied to that identity could also be compromised, the difference is I&#x27;m much less likely to find out until it&#x27;s too late and the potential harm to me is very high (lets say the government is operating a Silk Road honeypot).

For example, if you encode a 1000 letter message which includes at least one instance of every letter (both upper and lower case), then you&#x27;d have 52 symbols, and your simple prediction step would simply assign 1/52 as the probability for each symbol. This will result in a constant 5.7 bits of output per symbol. So your 1000 letter message would encode at 5700 bits.<p>Now, suppose you discard capitalization. Now there are 26 symbols, each assigned a probability of 1/26, resulting in a constant 4.7 bits per symbol. Your 1000 letter message will now encode at 4700 bits. So you only save about 17% in this very generously constructed case.<p>The mistake you&#x27;ve made is to assume that cutting the <i>number of symbols</i> in half will cut the <i>symbol length</i> in half. In fact, reducing the number of symbols by half merely reduces the symbol length by a <i>single bit</i>. For example, you need 8 bits to specify between 256 possibilities, but if you cut the possibilities down to 128, you still need 7 bits.<p>In addition, lossy compression is usually combined with lossless compression, and a smart predictor could use context to reduce the cost of capital letters to much less than one bit per symbol (assuming that the text has a predictable structure, like human language).",1371497894

As others note, the best tolerable improvement in travel time is lost amid the fixed overhead of embarking/disembarking times getting people to and on the vehicle.<p><i>passengers aren&#x27;t really interested in experiencing much more than 1G accelerations</i><p>Assuming continuous 1G acceleration (halfway there, reverse thrust thereafter), NYC-to-London would peak at 1200km/h with travel time of 34 minutes. Ignoring overhead, that&#x27;s about 1/15th the time for subsonic travel now; an impressive improvement for sure, yet still paltry when comparing computing improvements.<p>Flipping the original argument and blathering on, consider if computing improvements over 30 years led to just a 72MHz processor as commercial top-of-the line: indeed in general we&#x27;d favor cost over speed. Likewise, the cost of a one-way London-NYC flight has plummeted from a quarter of one&#x27;s annual salary to just a couple days&#x27; pay, a drop around two orders of magnitude; availability is also an issue, with comparable flights happening thousands of times daily at relatively amazing convenience, vs limited to a couple hundred per year.",1371497389

The problem is not that you have to check for null, the problem is that you don&#x27;t know if null is a valid value, and even if you know it&#x27;s not, you don&#x27;t know why the method failed. This is simply a lack of a channel for returning errors.<p>There are a lot of ways to fix this problem... Many modern languages use exceptions for this. Some languages use out parameters. Languages with multiple return values often return a value and an error. They&#x27;re all essentially equivalent, and yes, they&#x27;re all better than just returning null.<p>I don&#x27;t really see a difference between:<p><pre><code>  data_source.person(id) do |person|
      person.phone_number = phone_number
      data_source.update_person person
  end
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>  data_source.updatePhoneNumber(id, phone_number)
</code></pre>
The latter one encapsulates the find, the error handling, and the setting. Yes, you might have a null check in there. Or you might have a try/catch, or you might be checking an out value or a multiply returned error value.... there&#x27;s really no difference. You&#x27;ve changed the API to signify that the person might not exist and this function might not actually do anything. And that&#x27;s fine, if that&#x27;s fine. However, most of the time, if I go to set someone&#x27;s phone number, I want to know if the system thinks that person doesn&#x27;t exist.",1371496768

One thing that I did not mention is the fact that the 7 tickets are actually &quot;standing&quot; -- I kindof prefer that as it means you&#x27;re up right next to the stage. I always bought tickets on the day and they&#x27;re pretty much never sold out (popular days/weekends could mean a fairly tight view :)<p>About scalability, as someone already said, there are so many venues available that pretty much whatever you wanted to do, there was always available seats for you -- just perhaps not in your first choice of venue (even after restricting your ticket price to 15 or less) Heck, as you&#x27;re already in London and the public transport is free (you&#x27;ve got a travelcard as you have to commute to work anyway), you can go and do/watch/listen to something for free every night of the week.<p>Point taken about CD&#x27;s in the library. But somehow even though I had the opportunity to take them out of the library before, I never made use of it. I guess I never knew I&#x27;d like classical music. But as the live performance was so cheap, I tried it and found I really liked it.<p>And now I live on the outskirts of London. I pay about the same in rent (bigger place) but hardly ever go into London. Mainly because I used to live about 12minutes from Waterloo and now it&#x27;s more like an hour and a half (which means all trips have to be planned for weekends; as I can&#x27;t really be bothered to head out after a full day&#x27;s work)<p>Would I rather still live in London? Possibly not. But I&#x27;m definitely happy I lived there for a couple of years.<p>>>You&#x27;d be surprised what a couple extra thousand dollars per month adds up to in the long run<p>Well, like I said, there really is no change in my rent (but I now have a two bed flat and not a one bed), and I now own a car (additional expense). I&#x27;ve also stopped eating out, as restaurants are nowhere near as cheap as they were in London (expensive restaurants were a lot more expensive, but I&#x27;ve never found places that do 2.50 mains like in Tooting, for example) -- on the flip side I always enjoyed cooking, so this isn&#x27;t a big deal for me. I am also living closer to work (as I work outside London now), so I guess my quality of life is better & the commute is less stressful (and the pollution is lower).<p>I&#x27;m just not as ready as you are to dismiss all the benefits of living in a city. But hey, we&#x27;re all different. Just saying that I had a point of view very similar to yours until I was forced (SO&#x27;s job change) to live in London for awhile.

I&#x27;ve had great experiences with using them in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France. Then there is the outlier which makes you question using it at all. There is one thing you pay for in hotels and that is service and it is a requirement. With a hotel you won&#x27;t ever be stranded in a foreign country, but with Airbnb it&#x27;s possible.<p>I recently booked a stay in Prague which seemed positive, with quite a large number of positive reviews. Normally with all my other airbnb stays, I contact the host many days before and organise a way to check in and a time. This has worked out well, we simply meet at a specified time, talk and get given the keys and shown around the place. Back to the story in Prague, I contact the host 4 days prior to check in and receive no reply for those 4 days. The listing on the website becomes &#x27;disabled&#x27; and the last calendar activity of the host is 6 weeks ago. There are then reports saying that previous tenants where &#x27;bumped&#x27; to a different apartment as there was a problem with the listed apartment. This raises alarm bells to me and the last thing I want to do is arrive in a foreign country and be left stranded. Which is exactly what happened. I contacted AirBNB a day prior to the event detailing the &#x27;fishiness&#x27; via online medium and have only received automated replies.<p>Luckily our host in a previous city had a friend who could arrange us a stay at short notice. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, people are people and there are fantastic people out there.<p>So really the price difference is a multitude of services, and how much you will risk being stranded or mislead.",1371496368

Now that type expressions have become so complex, it&#x27;s better to have a syntax where you know a type expression is expected.

8915747,comment,8913572,8913572,0,0,zaroth,,,"I have zero experience in Rust, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t comment on an intermediate tutorial, but just some thoughts. I&#x27;m sure the answers to most of this are out there, this is more stream of consciousness...<p>&quot;let i = 1&quot;, so let isn&#x27;t picky about types, and types can be implied. In the &#x27;fn foo(i: i64)&#x27; we see the &quot;<name>: <type>&quot; syntax, which I&#x27;m not an immediate fan of that, but no big deal.<p>We have value types, defined as a &#x27;struct&#x27; with a &#x27;Copy&#x27; flag. The &quot;impl Copy for Info {}&quot; syntax seems weird, and the &quot;#[derive(Copy)]&quot; only slightly better. Also, why does the struct have a hanging comma after the last (only) member?<p>Next we add some methods to the Bob struct. Seems like there are multiple ways, depending on the type of method? &#x27;new&#x27; is just nested inside an &#x27;impl Bob&#x27; but &#x27;Drop&#x27; is more explicitly nested inside &#x27;impl Drop for Bob&#x27; and then a lowercase &#x27;drop&#x27; function. Huh.<p>Inside the &#x27;new&#x27; function we see the first use of return values. And starting to catch on that Rust likes chatty syntax, e.g. the &#x27;->&#x27; before the return type. But yet, a very implicit structure to both initializing and returning the new &#x27;Bob&#x27; object! I get the sinking feeling the &#x27;name: name.to_string()&#x27; in the Bob initializer is important, and that &#x27;{ name: name }&#x27; would sadly not work... Not loving the underscore in method names.<p>I guess the &#x27;drop&#x27; function is a first example of an instance method, identified by having &#x27;&self&#x27; or in this case &#x27;&mut self&#x27;. For a function that internally doesn&#x27;t explicitly mutate bob, it&#x27;s curious to see the &mut in that case. I&#x27;m going to guess &#x27;drop&#x27; is a special case which always must be &#x27;mut&#x27;.<p>The next step is &quot;make bob value format-able when outputting to console&quot; which sounds an awful lot like implementing to_string() but is accomplished through the &#x27;Show::fmt&#x27; trait which is implemented using &#x27;fmt::Show&#x27;. Is it really called the &quot;Show::fmt&quot; trait, and not the &quot;fmt::Show&quot; trait?<p>Here&#x27;s where I like the syntax less and less: &quot;fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result&quot;. Why must &#x27;f&#x27; be &#x27;mut&#x27; here? Why is the &#x27;&mut&#x27; before the type and not before the name? The one colon for name/value versus two colons for namespace is starting to hurt. Why a double colon instead of a dot? Also, I have to figure out what are all these ampersands are actually doing... they are notably absent from the &#x27;black_hole&#x27; function.<p>Skipping ahead... owned values can be mutated, you just have to flag it with &#x27;let mut&#x27;. Almost wish that was simply &#x27;met&#x27; vs &#x27;let&#x27;, or even &#x27;mlet&#x27;. Any owner can flag their value mutable, it doesn&#x27;t have to start that way.<p>Then we get to &quot;fn mutate(mut value: Bob) { ... }&quot;. Earlier we saw the &#x27;fmt&#x27; function apply &#x27;mut&#x27; before the type definition, here mut keyword is before the variable name. Is this the same, or something different happening? It seems weird there&#x27;s not just one place to put the &#x27;mut&#x27; flag.<p>BTW, can you really not just do &#x27;bob.name = &quot;mutant&quot;;&#x27; versus &#x27;bob.name = String::from_str(&quot;mutant&quot;);&#x27;? Up until this point string handling seems reasonably sane.<p>Further down we start putting things on the heap instead of stack. In &#x27;let bob = Box::new(Bob::new(&quot;A&quot;));&#x27; -- do you have to always &#x27;Box::new&#x27; to get to the heap, or is there a way to define Bob as always living on the heap, i.e. &#x27;class&#x27; vs &#x27;struct&#x27;? ... I think I spoke too soon, because further down when it takes all of &#x27;Rc::new(RefCell::new(Bob::new(&quot;A&quot;)))&quot; to simply have a stack pointer to a mutable instance on the heap, I think I&#x27;m ready to bolt.<p>It&#x27;s an impressive level of control over the semantics of how objects are created and destroyed without having to explicitly control every aspect of memory management, and there do seem to be a lot of follow-on benefits for going through all this trouble, but perhaps by 2.0 they will have made strides to improve the syntax to something a bit less obnoxious.",1421736406

8915731,comment,8914678,8915729,0,0,nsomaru,,,"(ctd from parent)<p>6--\nA man who thinks for himself is related to the ordinary book-philosopher as an eyewitness is to an historian: the former speaks from his own immediate experience. That is why all men who think for themselves are in fundamental agreement: their differences spring only from their differing standpoints; for they merely express what they have objectively apprehended. The book-philosopher, on the contrary, reports what this man has said and that has thought and the other has objected, etc. Then he compares, weighs, criticizes these statements, and thus tries to get to the truth of the matter, in which respect he exactly resembles the critical historian.<p>7--\nMere experience is no more a substitute for thinking than reading is. Pure empiricism is related to thinking as eating is to digestion and assimilation. When empiricism boasts that it alone has, through its discoveries, advanced human knowledge, it is as if the mouth should boast that it alone keeps the body alive.<p>8--\nThe characteristic mark of minds of the first rank is the immediacy of all their judgements. Everything they produce is the result of thinking for themselves and already in the way it is spoken everywhere announces itself as such. He who truly thinks for himself is like a monarch, in that he recognizes no one over him. His judgements, like the decisions of a monarch, arise directly from his own absolute power. He no more accepts authorities than a monarch does orders, and he acknowledges the validity of nothing he has not himself confirmed.<p>9--\nIn the realm of actuality, however fair, happy and pleasant we may find it, we are nonetheless always under the influence of gravity, which we have continually to overcome: in the realm of thought, on the contrary, we are disembodied minds, weightless and without needs or cares. That is why there is no happiness on earth to compare with that which a beautiful and fruitful mind finds in a propitious hour in itself.<p>10--\nThere are very many thoughts which have value for him who thinks them, but only a few of them possess the power of engaging the interest of a reader after they have been written down.<p>11--\nYet, all the same, only that possesses true value which you have thought in the first instance for your own instruction. Thinkers can be divided into those who think in the first instance for their own instruction and those who do so for the instruction of others. The former are genuine thinkers for themselves in both senses of the words: they are the true philosophers. They alone are in earnest. The pleasure and happiness of their existence consists in thinking. The latter are sophists: they want to appear as thinkers and seek their happiness in what they hope thereby to get from others. This is what they are in earnest about. To which of these two classes a man belongs may quickly be seen by his whole style and manner. Lichtenberg is an example of the former class, Herder certainly belongs to the latter.<i></i><p>12--\nWhen you consider how great and how immediate is the problem of existence, this ambiguous, tormented, fleeting, dream-like existence – so great and so immediate that as soon as you are aware of it it overshadows and obscures all other problems and aims; and when you then see how men, with a few rare exceptions, have no clear awareness of this problem, indeed seem not to be conscious of it at all, but concern themselves with anything rather than with this problem and live on taking thought only for the day and for the hardly longer span of their own individual future, either expressly refusing to consider this problem or contenting themselves with some system of popular metaphysics; when, I say, you consider this, you may come to the opinion that man can be called a thinking being only in a very broad sense of that term and no longer feel very much surprise at any thoughtlessness or silliness whatever, but will realize, rather, that while the intellectual horizon of the normal man is wider than that of the animal – whose whole existence is, as it were, one continual present, with no consciousness of past or future – it is not so immeasurably wider as is generally supposed.<p>* What you have inherited from your forefathers you must first win for yourself if you are to possess it.<p><i></i> Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742–99), aphorist and satirist.

8915729,comment,8914678,8914678,0,0,nsomaru,,,"There&#x27;s a great essay by Schopenhauer called &quot;On Thinking for Yourself&quot; which deals with this and related themes. I&#x27;ll post it here for your benefit (from the great Penguin translation titled &quot;Essays and Aphorisms&quot;:<p>On Thinking for Yourself<p>1-- \nAs the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself; because only through ordering what you know by comparing every truth with every other truth can you take complete possession of your knowledge and get it into your power. You can think about only what you know, so you ought to learn something; on the other hand, you can know only what you have thought about.\nNow you can apply yourself voluntarily to reading and learning, but you cannot really apply yourself to thinking: thinking has to be kindled, as a fire is by a draught, and kept going by some kind of interest in its object, which may be an objective interest or merely a subjective one. The latter is possible only with things that affect us personally, the former only to those heads who think by nature, to whom thinking is as natural as breathing, and these are very rare. That is why most scholars do so little of it.<p>2--<p>The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for yourself and that produced by reading is incredibly great, so that the original difference which made one head decide for thinking and another for reading is continually increased. For reading forcibly imposes on the mind thoughts that are as foreign to its mood and direction at the moment of reading as the signet is to the wax upon which it impresses its seal. The mind is totally subjected to an external compulsion to think this or that for which it has no inclination and is not in the mood. On the other hand, when it is thinking for itself it is following its own inclination, as this has been more closely determined either by its immediate surroundings or by some recollection or other: for its visible surroundings do not impose some single thought on the mind, as reading does; they merely provide it with occasion and matter for thinking the thoughts appropriate to its nature and present mood. The result is that much reading robs the mind of all elasticity, as the continual pressure of a weight does a spring, and that the surest way of never having any thoughts of your own is to pick up a book every time you have a free moment. The practice of doing this is the reason erudition makes most men duller and sillier than they are by nature and robs their writings of all effectiveness: they are in Pope’s words:\nFor ever reading, never to be read.<p>3--\nFundamentally it is only our own basic thoughts that possess truth and life, for only these do we really understand through and through. The thoughts of another that we have read are crumbs from another’s table, the cast-off clothes of an unfamiliar guest.<p>4--\nReading is merely a surrogate for thinking for yourself; it means letting someone else direct your thoughts. Many books, moreover, serve merely to show how many ways there are of being wrong, and how far astray you yourself would go if you followed their guidance. – You should read only when your own thoughts dry up, which will of course happen frequently enough even to the best heads; but to banish your own thoughts so as to take up a book is a sin against the Holy Ghost; it is like deserting untrammelled nature to look at a herbarium or engravings of landscapes.\nIt may sometimes happen that a truth, an insight, which you have slowly and laboriously puzzled out by thinking for yourself could easily have been found already written in a book; but it is a hundred times more valuable if you have arrived at it by thinking for yourself. For only then will it enter your thought-system as an integral part and living member, be perfectly and firmly consistent with it and in accord with all its other consequences and conclusions, bear the hue, colour and stamp of your whole manner of thinking, and have arrived at just the moment it was needed; thus it will stay firmly and for ever lodged in your mind. This is a perfect application, indeed explanation, of Goethe’s lines:\nWas du ererbt von deinen Vätern hast,\nErwirb es, um es zu besitzen.*<p>For the man who thinks for himself becomes acquainted with the authorities for his opinions only after he has acquired them and merely as a confirmation of them, while the book-philosopher starts with his authorities, in that he constructs his opinions by collecting together the opinions of others: his mind then compares with that of the former as an automaton compares with a living man.\nA truth that has merely been learnt adheres to us only as an artificial limb, a false tooth, a wax nose does, or at most like transplanted skin; but a truth won by thinking for ourself is like a natural limb: it alone really belongs to us. This is what determines the difference between a thinker and a mere scholar.<p>5--\nPeople who pass their lives in reading and acquire their wisdom from books are like those who learn about a country from travel descriptions: they can impart information about a great number of things, but at bottom they possess no connected, clear, thorough knowledge of what the country is like.

SpaceX delivered cargo to the international space station last week. NASA/REUTERS By ROLFE WINKLER, EVELYN RUSLI and ANDY PASZTOR Jan. 19, 2015 5:30 p.m. ET<p>Google Inc. is close to investing roughly $1 billion in Space Exploration Technologies Corp. to support its nascent efforts to deliver Internet access via satellites, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe investment would value SpaceX, backed by Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk , at more than $10 billion, according to this person. It isn’t clear what exact stake Google could end up with in the fast-growing space company.\nIf Google completes the deal, it would be the Internet company’s latest effort to use futuristic technology to spread Internet access to remote regions of the world, alongside high-altitude balloons and solar-powered drones. By extending Web access, Google increases the number of people who can use its services.\nSpokesmen for Google and SpaceX declined to comment.\nNews of Google’s potential investment was reported by tech blog The Information.\nGoogle has been considering satellite-based Internet service for more than a year. In late 2013, it hired satellite-industry veteran Greg Wyler, who at one point last year had more than 10 people working for him. Mr. Wyler left Google last summer and is now developing his own satellite-Internet venture.\nSpaceX builds and launches rockets and spacecraft. Mr. Musk last week described a general concept for SpaceX to launch hundreds of satellites into relatively low orbit to deliver Internet access across the globe. Mr. Musk told BusinessWeek the project could cost $10 billion to build and take at least five years, but gave no details about funding or manufacturing plans.\nFor several months Mr. Musk has been mulling ways to expand SpaceX’s rocket-and-spacecraft manufacturing operations to designing and building satellites, according to aerospace-industry officials who have talked with him. Though short on specifics, his latest comments were the clearest sign yet of a long-term commitment to such expansion plans.\nIt is likely to take years to establish designs and potentially set up a specialized satellite-making facility. But SpaceX already has some important building blocks. Industry officials said the company builds its own navigation and flight-control systems for spacecraft, which could provide some elements for satellites. There also are synergies between parts SpaceX makes today for solar arrays on spacecraft and such devices intended for satellites.\nOne big technical and financial challenge facing the proposed venture is the cost installing ground-based antennas and computer terminals to receive the satellite signals. That issue has bedeviled some earlier Internet-via-satellite projects and threatens to complicate Google’s efforts, satellite industry officials and consultants say.\nAnother unanswered question is how SpaceX plans to transmit Internet signals to Earth. The company isn’t believed to control rights to radio spectrum.\nMr. Musk has discussed using optical-laser technology in his satellites, according to a person familiar with the matter. That technology works by beaming information from satellites in space. But lasers wouldn’t be a reliable way to deliver Internet service to Earth because, unlike radio waves, they don’t easily pass through clouds.\nThe talks are somewhat unusual for Mr. Musk, who has resisted most outside investments that could reduce even slightly his control over SpaceX. Industry officials said if problems arise, SpaceX might need additional capital in the next few years to fund new rocket development and more launches. It isn’t clear what terms are under discussion.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Mr. Musk’s interest in satellite-Internet service in November, saying he was talking with Mr. Wyler.\nMr. Wyler last week said his new venture, OneWeb Ltd., had secured funding from Richard Branson ’s Virgin Group and chip company Qualcomm Inc. Mr. Wyler said he hopes to provide Internet service from a constellation of 648 satellites in low-Earth orbit, using a large block of radio spectrum he controls. Mr. Wyler estimated the plan would cost as much as $2 billion.\nMessrs. Musk and Wyler stopped working together because of disagreements over control of any joint project, according to a person familiar with their discussions.",1421734494

James Heckman, a University of Chicago Nobel laureate in economics, is one of the strongest voices in favor of early education for ­low-­income children, but here is what he says about applying the model to the middle class: 'Advocates and supporters of universal preschool often use existing research for purely political purposes. But the solid evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions is limited to those conducted on disadvantaged populations.' As Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Standardized Childhood (2007), explains, 'For ­middle-­class kids the quality of preschool centers would have to approach a ­nirvana-­like condition to present radically richer environments than the majority of ­middle-­class homes, or ­home-­based caregivers.'""",1232168284

437767,comment,437336,437336,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I've never understood why patents include so much stuff without
practical relationship to the idea in question.  In this case the
patent covers <i>a computer implemented method of automatically removing
space characters from data being entered into a database</i> and yet
the detailed description includes pages of gibberish like this:<p><pre><code>  With reference now to FIG. 3, a block diagram illustrating a data
  processing system is depicted in which the present invention may be
  implemented. Data processing system 300 is an example of a client
  computer. Data processing system 300 employs a peripheral component
  interconnect (PCI) local bus architecture. Although the depicted
  example employs a PCI bus, other bus architectures such as Accelerated
  Graphics Port (AGP) and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) may be
  used. Processor 302 and main memory 304 are connected to PCI local bus
  306 through PCI bridge 308. PCI bridge 308 also may include an
  integrated memory controller and cache memory for processor
  302. Additional connections to PCI local bus 306 may be made through
  direct component interconnection or through add-in boards. In the
  depicted example, local area network (LAN) adapter 310, Small computer
  system interface (SCSI) host bus adapter 312, and expansion bus
  interface 314 are connected to PCI local bus 306 by direct component
  connection. In contrast, audio adapter 316, graphics adapter 318, and
  audio/video adapter 319 are connected to PCI local bus 306 by add-in
  boards inserted into expansion slots. Expansion bus interface 314
  provides a connection for a keyboard and mouse adapter 320, modem 322,
  and additional memory 324. SCSI host bus adapter 312 provides a
  connection for hard disk drive 326, tape drive 328, and CD-ROM drive
  330. Typical PCI local bus implementations will support three or four
  PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors.

Now it seems like a good solution for the government to borrow a whole bunch more money and spend it on things that we may or may not need?  We won't have any of those nasty earmarks; instead, we'll just hand billions of dollars over to state and local governments to spend how they want.

Certainly not all naturopathic doctors are good, most are basically quacks.

One person said ""hey, I want to patent this idea"" and everybody else got in line to help make it happen.<p>IBM has a patent culture.  It encourages each employee to file as many patents as possible.  When you submit a patent internally, you get a one-time bonus.  When it goes from the internal lawyers to the patent office, you get another bonus.  When your patent is awarded months or years later, you get another one-time bonus.   If you file a certain number of patents, you get a certificate/plaque and more money.<p>(true story)
On the internal IBM blogs, I saw someone was frustrated by their email software.  Their immediate response?  File a patent for how they want it fixed.  Their problem?  They hit ""send"" by mistake before the email was complete.  Their patent?

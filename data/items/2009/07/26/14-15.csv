The value of an employee is what is paid on the market.<p>Since the relationship is asymetric, with the employer knowing more, being more capable of negotiating, and probably more savvy and intelligent, it is likely that the employees are paid less than what they could negotiate if they were more savvy, smart, or powerful.  Therefore, raising their pay via statute, so long as it is still less than the utility gained by the employer by having them around, won't cause anyone to lose a job.  There is very likely a gap in the pay the employees collect, and what they could collect if they were more savvy, or had better negotiating skills, or had access to the labor market data the employer has better access to.  In those cases where the new minimum wage falls within this gap you have no reason to suspect any loss of jobs.<p>However, such arguments are totally unnecessary, as we have been running a huge experiment for 60 years and can appeal to empirical data.  We do have a minimum wage, and you will not be able to find anyone cannot find a job that is not suffering from psychiatric illness or a substance abuser.   Temporary unemployment during economic downswings doesn't count, obviously.",1248620312

Front end best practices can be <i>objectively demonstrated to work</i> and they are <i>repeatable</i>.<p>Example: if your site loads 3 CSS files, and you combine them into 1 CSS file, you <i>will</i> experience performance increases.  Period.  If you do not gzip your HTML/Javascript/CSS yet, and you are not making a pathological example site just to prove me wrong, you <i>will</i> experience (probably significant!) performance increases.  If you increase the number of static assets you load in parallel (for example, by splitting static assets over 2 additional subdomains), you <i>will</i> see most browsers have significant, automatic performance increases for pages that load non-trivial amounts of static assets.  etc, etc",1248618627
724425,comment,724272,724272,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>There are, however, no examples of successful health care based on the principles of the free market</i><p>This is easy to refute.<p>Flash back 100 years. People had healthcare they received from a family doctor. Insurance was non-existent, and the free market reigned.<p>In fact, it was the <i>success</i> of the free market in healthcare that led -- and continues to lead -- for more and more complicated, expensive treatments that save more and more lives.<p>I see three problems with markets and healthcare:<p>1) Insurance policies are so obfuscated that nobody understands what they are buying. Government needs to step in here and create standard insurance policy baselines. This will allow me to make an informed decision.<p>2) The people receiving healthcare have little or no input into cost control -- the people controlling costs have no ""skin in the game"" when it comes to value and quality of care. This decoupling needs to be fixed to encourage individuals to monitor and control their own costs.<p>3) If society has a greater interest in making sure there is a basic level of healthcare for all, as it does with say automotive insurance, then it should be a law for all people to have personal health insurance that covers these catastrophic scenarios. This would also mean allowing all insurance to be tax deductable and decoupling insurance completely from employers. It should be completely portable and associated just with the person.<p>Compared to some of the huge plans I've seen, these are really easy to describe. A bill could be just a couple of pages, and most Americans could understand exactly what is being passed. Instead of trying to have one huge law ""fix"" the problem, it simply provides some definitions and takes one huge problem and breaks it up into hundreds of millions of little problems that can be solved various ways.<p>Why we continue to think that some legislative body can create gargantuan one-size-fits-all solutions is beyond me. Evolution, machine learning, market theory, chaos -- lots of real, hard science says that solutions are iterative, incremental, and adaptive. Not complex and static.",1248618607

Not because it is moral just, but because it is financially a more useful model as long as it is to expensive to run through the private system.<p>But again, it's not black and white, there are many arguments for and against.",1248618523

Well, it certainly isn't the whole story.<p>IANAL, but this snippet from a web page accords almost precisely with my memory of what I learned when I had cause to deal with such a matter professionally:<p><pre><code>  > A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly\n  > appropriates property belonging to another with\n  > the intention of permanently depriving the other\n  > of it ...\n</code></pre>\nAccording to law, it's not theft if you did it honestly, or if you intended to give it back.  ""Consent"" is not part of the legal definition.<p>EDIT: I note that the wikipedia article mentions consent. These things will differ between English, American and other country's laws.<p>Certainly in the case of taxes the intent is to deprive permanently, so it comes down to whether it's dishonest.  Since the government makes the laws, and the government won't want taxation to be declared theft, we can deduce that taxation isn't dishonest.<p>According to the government.",1248618070

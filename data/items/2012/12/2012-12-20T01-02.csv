4945926,comment,4945345,4945552,14,0,jcoby,,,"Just FYI, with most CC processors, chargeback fees are in addition to reversing the original charge. So you would be out $25 if you were to get a chargeback. And if you won you would get the $10 back but still loose the $15 chargeback fee putting you at -$5 overall (that's not even including transaction fees that stack on top of everything).<p>Most CC companies have a 90 day limit on charges that can be contested. Amex is the only one that I know of that goes further back (1 year IIRC but it may be longer).<p>Stripe has decided to change that and will refund the $15 if you win. It's a nice change but in my experience the vendor rarely reverses chargebacks.",1355968676

Re: innovation, the Chinese aren't known for strong patent enforcement, but they're also not known for innovation either. They have lax IP enforcement because their technology sector depends on copying technology from the US. Indeed, China has been stepping up IP enforcement as of late, which has been correlated with an increased willingness of American companies to invest in China. As China develops, it has been hiring American legal experts to help them develop a sophisticated, American-style legal system, because that helps attract foreign investment.

They are essential to our ability to utilize the chemicals we get from these macro nutrients.<p>>Refined/processed food should be eaten in minimal quantities because it spikes blood sugar and causes insulin fatigue, which in the long run causes Type II diabetes.
  True, but this also an increasingly old school and one dimensional way of thinking about how type II develops. There are a host of genetic and environmental factors that effect an individual's response and eventual tolerance to insulin.<p>Sadly, being in med school does not guarantee you ""know what you're talking about"", in fact, even after you get to wear that white coat you'll probably realize you know way less than you could ever imagine.

First, lifestyle. People eat too much because that's simply how they live their lives. It may be because they only have access to high-calorie food, or because everybody around them eats too much, or because they have made a habit of eating too much. The second group (which I'm a part of) is worse: for them, food is an addiction. Many of them may already eat ""healthy"", high-quality stuff - so moving away from fast food does nothing for them.

Rather, to take stock of the benefits and the pain that arises from the current design, and to try completely different approaches. You do it because there's a nagging voice in the back of your head that tells you that you've left some ""goodness"" on the table ... that even though your current implementation ""works"", the problem could be solved better.<p>You've already ""loaded the problem into your head,"" because you've solved it once. The second solution will improve in some ways and possibly regress in some ways.

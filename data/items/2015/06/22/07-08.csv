9756776,comment,9755683,9756558,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"It seems like the problem is at least partly financial. Greece lived beyond its means for years, running a significant trade deficit. The government did not take appropriate steps for the country to live within its means. The link that you provided about the submarines demonstrates significant irresponsible spending: Greece had twice as many tanks as UK. Why did it buy four new submarines? Did it not at least consider cutting all that pointless military spending?<p>It also seems like there&#x27;s a lot of corruption and irresponsible financial policy. For example, Greece&#x27;s ridiculous policies around early retirement, such as that allow hairdressers, radio or television anchors, and musicians playing wind isntruments to retire at 50 for women, and 55 for men, due to &quot;hazardous working conditions&quot;.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/business/global/12pension.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/business/global/12pension....</a><p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/15/unsustainable-futures-greece-pensions-dilemma-explained-financial-crisis-default-eurozone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/15/unsustainabl...</a><p>A starting point would be predominately eliminating early retirement, and raising the retirement age to one similar to other countries. It seems like Syriza has been refusing to do that, because the Greek population is pushing them to keep these policies in place. Germany, by comparison, raised its retirement age to 67 years and Spain has done the same. They&#x27;re talking about raising it to 69. It&#x27;s understandable if German taxpayers are reluctant to fund Greeks&#x27; early retirement (on average, the lowest in Europe).<p>If Greece and the Greek government wants to embrace reforms, then they need to end corruption and put reasonable policies in place. To be fair, the current article has Greece&#x27;s finance minister proposing to end early retirement. But, why is this being proposed at the 11th hour, right before default? Why is this part of their proposal to receive further loans, rather than an a voluntary sovereign action that&#x27;s obviously necessary to correct their economy (independent from any loans)? The fact that Greece hasn&#x27;t <i>already</i> taken steps like these to reform their economy, and is essentially holding the reforms hostage on further loans, is surely part of the reason why Greece&#x27;s partners don&#x27;t trust them. Greece should have put these reforms in place long ago by their own accord. They should have done it in a way that&#x27;s clearly advertised to their own taxpayers as Greek responsibility for Greek spending, rather than positioning it as part of an agreement that, no doubt, they will say was &quot;forced&quot; on them. All of these facts together give the impression that Greece isn&#x27;t committed to doing the right thing. Greece&#x27;s irresponsible spending and financial policy are the responsibility of its government and people.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s child abuse, though, as both the parents and children are part of this world view which uses socially accepted norms for success as their primary metrics of worth. It&#x27;s an extreme form of absolute submission to external motivation.<p>I think this comes from a culture of insecurity, addiction to simple success metrics, and maybe even a little intellectual laziness. Doing well in school isn&#x27;t worthless, but it&#x27;s perpendicular to learning to decide for yourself what your values are and in what direction you want to pull the world as you interact with it.

We have an 18 month old daughter, and while I don&#x27;t consider myself an expert on parenting (far from it), I can share some points:<p>1. Having a child is both the scariest and the coolest thing that happened to us. You constantly feel like you have no idea what you&#x27;re doing, but in the end you will always manage.<p>2. Don&#x27;t be fooled by people that say that &quot;your life together will be over&quot; and &quot;enjoy your time together while you still can&quot;. This is bullshit. This is your own family, so you can make your own choices in how to spend your family time and together time. For example, when our daughter was small enough to still sleep in the stroller, we regularly went out for dinner together and let her sleep next to our table. Maybe this doesn&#x27;t work out in your situation; the point is that there are no rules on what you can and cannot do once you have a kid. Don&#x27;t let yourself be forced into the &quot;now we must always stay at home&quot; mantra, because it is total nonsense.<p>3. If you are free to work from home, and you have a quiet place in the house where you can do so, then I would totally recommend it, even if it&#x27;s only a day per week. I&#x27;m working from home full time myself and it&#x27;s amazing how much time I get to spend with my family. Not just breakfast and dinner, but also the seemingly mundane things like kissing her &quot;goodnight&quot; when she goes to bed for her afternoon nap.

So the parliament is dominated by a center-right and center-left coalition which work together to make up the government. The opposition is largely made up of &quot;fuck the EU&quot; protest parties who pride themselves in not participating in any sort of political affairs. And since the voting is the European tradition of &quot;you vote for the party, not individual members,&quot; you tend to have members that toe the party lines (unlike the US political system). The end result is that European elections tend not to be able to effect any change in policy in the European Parliament.<p>The term I heard used for this is &quot;democratic deficit.&quot;",1434957548

There are numerous software libraries that can be used to integrate encryption schemes into older applications, including libraries from PKWare. Other government agencies and financial institutions already utilize such software, according to Matt Little, VP of Product Development at PKWare. The problem is that, as DHS Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity Andy Ozment noted during his testimony, OPM didn&#x27;t have the kind of authentication infrastructure in place for its major applications to take advantage of encryption in the first place.

Greeks are lazy, they retire early, the pensions are &quot;insanely high compared to even the Greek economy before the collapse&quot;. The European Union frames this conflict like this the whole time. Sure there are people that screwed up, that took advantage of the situation. There is corruption and extremely poor government for many years. But when you look past that, to the normal Greek person, trying to to the best and make a living then things aren&#x27;t so simple anymore. DO you really belive that an entire country is evil and corrupt? My 2 uncles have both worked 6 days a week from 10:00AM until 22:00 PM, and 14 days a year vacation. They started working when they were 14 years old, worked until they were 78 and 79 (While we fight the 67 yr retirement rule in the rest of Europe). When they retired, they had to wait 2 years before their pension would start being paid out (normal practice). Only to find out that it was cut in half when it finally arrived. One of them died, the other one (84)  now lives on a pension of less than 650 Euro per month. 300 goes to the rent. That leaves him 300 Euro to buy food, pay the bills, get healthcare, support his children (3), of which 2 have been fired and cannot get a job anywhere. And their grandchildren don&#x27;t have jobs either (which is far more concerning imo). He has a heart condition, yet cannot pay for any medicines. His son has cancer, there is no money for medicines. So when you say that people aren&#x27;t starving on the streets, then you may want to think about this situation and let it sink in. There is huge poverty in Greece, you may not se it, but it is there. My uncle isn&#x27;t in a unique situation, this has happened to many, many Greeks.",1434956985

Not everything is though (this is the key part), so when you finally do find something good your brain gives you a dopamine rush, which addicts you. I won&#x27;t pretend that I don&#x27;t struggle with this addiction myself, but I&#x27;ve found having genuinely interesting work really helps - I read HN at work quite rarely at my new job.",1434956435

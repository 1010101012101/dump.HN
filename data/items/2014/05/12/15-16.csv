It is not uncommon for people to stop reading the first book at a few chapters in.  Perhaps you should try something different for your first novel.  I like the Chronicles of Narnia series by CS Lewis, his writing is short and to the point, but very descriptive in its own way.  That may not be your cup of tea, though.  You may want to ask friends or family who know your tastes better what they would recommend.  Or just read the next 5 chapters of harry Potter and see if it gets any better for you- I think for most people it does.",1399910370

Its low-order bits (back in the day) went through a predictable sequence, so rand() & 0x1 was a bad source of random bits.<p>I don&#x27;t think that rand() was specified so fully as to make this behavior required, but typical implementations exhibited it, so you could not use rand() for any serious work.<p>random() came after, does not use a LCG, and thus fixed this problem, so you would not see it if your code calls random(), whose man page says:<p><pre><code>  The difference [between random() and rand()] is that rand() produces a much less\n  random sequence -- in fact, the low dozen bits generated by rand go through a\n  cyclic pattern.  All of the bits generated by random() are usable.

In early 2002, federal agents harassed many of my friends who belonged to a mosque in the Northeast.  Some were detained and abused by police officers. Sadly, this behavior has continued, further evolving into a vehicle for racism and religious prejudice. I recall a story on HN several months ago about a startup investor who was detained in an airport all day because he was Muslim.<p>If you don&#x27;t like your neighbors because of their names, their traditions, the color of their skin or the smell of their food, you can simply call them terrorists. That word, even when it is devoid of concrete evidence, has the power to ruin someone&#x27;s life. In this specific sense, our modern fear of &quot;terrorists&quot; reminds me of the power of the word &quot;communist&quot; during the 1950s, in the McCarthy era.<p>Eventually, most Americans saw McCarthy&#x27;s so-called Red Scare for what it was: an excuse to act based on personal prejudices and political agendas.",1399910340

7733487,comment,7732677,7733277,4,0,timsally,,,"The argument that we should send special operations forces every time to go grab people is a common one, but it falls short in several respects.<p>The first is that most people do not realize how long and difficult the modern training pipeline is for SOF. Operators are extremely valuable and hard to come by and you do not want to risk them unnecessarily when you have other legal means of accomplishing the mission. For example, it takes 12 months to even qualify as a Navy SEAL, and then another 12-18 months of platoon training before a deployment. Only a tiny fraction of those who start the SEAL pipeline actually make it through due to the difficulty of the training. It is for this reason that the Navy offers $40,000 to anyone who can make it through the training (<a href=""http://navyseals.com/files/ChallengeSEAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://navyseals.com/files/ChallengeSEAL.pdf</a>) and reenlistment bonuses for operators can approach $100,000. And never-mind the cost of the equipment used during the operation. How much do you think the stealth helicopter that got destroyed during the Osama Bin Laden raid cost?<p>The second is that there is some serious armchair quarterbacking going on. I think its crazy to assert what our armed forces should and shouldn&#x27;t do without a full understanding of what you are asking of them. The complexities of planning a SOF operation that goes deep into a place like Yemen are quite involved. For more on this, I suggest the book <i>The Black Banners</i> by Ali Soufan. It possible (and even likely) that a capture operation for Anwar al-Awlaki was either impossible, or possible but likely to end in the death of al-Awlaki anyway.",1399910308

It&#x27;s often enough a feat in itself just to get the thing to run locally. Once I&#x27;ve got it running, I just start breaking things to learn how all of the pieces work.

7733481,comment,7732513,7732513,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"One thing that our application (processing real-estate data feeds) needs is the ability to figure out an approximate location if the address is a little vague.<p>For example, when we a vague address such as &quot;Ichobod Crane Circle&quot;, we still want to get a position because that road is very short. However, if the address is something like &quot;Sleepy Hollow Road&quot; or &quot;Murders Kill Road&quot; (Coxsackie sure has some weird names), those are very long roads, and placing a marker anywhere on them would be meaningless.<p>Google solves this for us by providing, in the results, the bounding box of the result. When the match is not &quot;street_address&quot; but something else such as &quot;route&quot;, &quot;premise&quot;, &quot;point_of_interest&quot; or the like, what we do is take the bounding_box, calculate the area, and use the area if it&#x27;s less than 500x500 meters. It&#x27;s not optimal, but it&#x27;s better than having no location at all.<p>Another thing that Google does semi-well is constrain the search to a specific area, like a country or a state. Unfortunately, Google doesn&#x27;t let you pass in more than one state, but other than that, it works well. Some of the addresses we get are so vague that they would geocode to other countries (Oxford, England instead of Oxford, NY) if it were not for this filtering ability.",1399910249
7733480,comment,7732677,7733112,1,0,logn,,,"The rights mentioned in the Constitution have been generally understood to apply to people in the US.  Likewise, there was a time when rights did not apply to black people. It&#x27;s certainly possible we could pass an amendment extending rights to all non-citizens, but it would have to be done in order for the distinction that irks you to be fixed. Probably the most realistic route for that to happen is that via the UN or other treaty talks, pressure is put on the President and Congress to pass such an amendment. But people who point to international law and then scoff at the US for breaking it really should focus their scorn on their own countries for shortcomings on foreign affairs politics with the US.",1399910246

As things stood when he was killed, it was impossible to bring him back for a trial without an unacceptably high risks to the people in the armed forces who would have had to capture him. If you wanted some insight on the complexities of operating within Yemen, I suggest <i>The Black Banners</i> by Ali Soufan. The subject of the book is the events leading up to 9/11 and Soufan was one of the FBI&#x27;s top agents and strong critic enhanced interrogation. He invested the <i>USS Cole</i> bombing in Yemen and he covers the difficulty of working in country quite well.",1399910218

My point is that a single thermostat can only go so far in optimizing cooling in an installation much larger than a studio apartment.  A $30 programmable thermostat can probably bring you within 90% of the maximum achievable optimization for all other dwellings.  And, depending on where you live, a cheap fan can quite literally bring your cooling bill from hundreds of dollars per month to $10 per month.

7733438,comment,7732572,7733181,9,0,wbond,,,"I would not be surprised if you can construct contrived examples of how Python 3 can be broken. In my experience, writing real life code, I ship more stable software writing in Python 3 than Python 2.<p>I mostly work with subprocesses or directly reading data from socket connections, and I run all of my bytes through strict mode. If something doesn&#x27;t decode properly, an error is returned. Currently I am working on an interactive way (inside of Sublime Text) to present to the user a way to see text in different encodings so they can help debug the issue on their own.<p>So, yes, you need to write helper functions and have an interface to deal with properly handling encodings. This has been my experience in every language I&#x27;ve ever worked in. I can&#x27;t imagine there is a way around it. Is this a reason Python 3 sucks compared to 2? Not in my experience. I had far more issues in Python 2 with encodings and not being sure what other libraries and packages had done in regards to handling unicode data. Hmm, so ftplib accepts unicode for filenames. Does it encode it? What encoding does it use? Oh, look at that, it has just been coercing to ascii because it can.<p>So yeah, writing a simple little toy command line app needs more boiler-plate to deal with unicode. Any real app is going to need that and a ton more. And you are going to have to decide how to error with encodings, and how to let users identify encodings. And you are going to need to write a global exception handler for Python to capture unexpected exceptions and log them to a file so users can send crash reports. Yay, sys.excepthook!<p>But anyway, I think it all comes back to the fact that I know what I am dealing with far more quickly with Python 3 than with 2. Again, maybe because I don&#x27;t write apps that deal with local file paths (expect abstracted through a subprocess).<p>Unfortunately, most of the code where I deal with crappy encodings from FTP servers and SVN is closed source.

Making these kinds of air conditioning units into intelligent devices could have significant effects.<p>Why do think I Nest is a gimmick almost bordering on a marketing scam?  Because in only works in a relatively narrow range of applications (i.e.: small one or two room apartment).  In a larger family home --and particularly a two story home-- it is worthless.  You could save money with a cheap programmable thermostat.  In order to really save money in such settings you need a zone system with one thermostat/sensor per zone, a multiple stage compressor (or multiple condensing units), a variable speed air handler, a high efficiency HEPA filter, attic exhaust fans and, ideally, a filtered outside air bypass system to take advantage of cool night air.<p>I am in the middle of renovating my home and have done all the research.  Nest is a waste of time and money.  You&#x27;d save far more money --FAR MORE-- buying a relatively cheap whole house fan to cool the house down at night (at least in my region).  But, hey, everyone believes that technology is magical.  Damn the math and physics.  Hence the hype and sales.<p>Automating window units is a different game.  These are devoted mostly to cooling single rooms.  So now you have the equicalent of a highly granular zone system.  If you have a home or office with several of these units an intelligent control system could, depending on traffic patterns and the daily flow of people in and out of the various spaces, have a big impact.  This is different.<p>EDIT: I see the cargo-cult HN down-voting got started right away.  You can&#x27;t say anything bad about Apple, Tesla, Nest and others on HN.  Of course, they never back-up their downvote because it&#x27;s purely emotionally driven.<p>So, here&#x27;s the challenge:  If you think I am wrong about Nest tell me why and back it up.  The comparison is between Nest and a cheap programmable thermostat.  People&#x27;s lives are reasonably regular and heat cycles in the summer are too.  If you are intent on saving money a programmable thermostat will do wonders.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting with this for three years knowing that we would have to redo our cooling and heating system in 2014/15.  I&#x27;ve gone two full summers without running the air conditioner but for two weeks by rigging and intelligent $200 fan (meaning, I hooked it up to a $5 timer) to exchange air out of the house when outside air was cooler than inside.  That move alone represented a savings of around $500 PER MONTH.  See my point?",1399908497

Have a go at this passage from A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man, by Joyce, wherein the protagonist Stephen Dedalus is losing his mind after having spent a week being whipped into a religious frenzy. He is alone in his room pondering his frequent visits to brothels:<p>> He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers? To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, flesh, benumbed and weary.<p>><p>> That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and over-cloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cowardly and sin-corrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and, wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again with his hands. He had sinned. He had sinned so deeply against heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called God&#x27;s child.<p>><p>> Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, secretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impenitence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead? The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer together and binding down his eyelids: but the senses of his soul would not be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered, he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or see. He desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for an instant and then opened. He saw.<p>><p>> A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettle-bunches. Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight struggling upwards from all the ordure through the bristling grey-green weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light, curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the stale crusted dung.<p>><p>> Creatures were in the field: one, three, six: creatures were moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india-rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them. A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces. One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, another complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling closer and closer to enclose, to enclose, soft language issuing from their lips, their long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces...<p>><p>> Help!<p>><p>> He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lecherous goatish fiends. For him! For him!<p>><p>> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and almost fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion seized him within; and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he vomited profusely in agony.",1399907828

On Python 3 you have so many different mental models you constantly need to juggle with.  (Is it unicode, is it latin1 transfer encoded unicode, does it contain surrogates) and then for each of them you need to start thinking where you are writing it to.  Is it a bytes based stream?  then surrogate errors can be escaped and might result in encoding garbage same as in python 2.  If it a text stream?  Then that no longer works then you can either crash or write different garbage.  If it&#x27;s latin1 transfer encoded then most people don&#x27;t even know that they have garbage.  I filed lots of bugs against that in WSGI libs.<p>If you write error free Python 3 unicode code, then teach me.  (Or show me your repo and I show you all the bugs you now have)",1399907744

Python 3 requires you to do something more complicated when crap comes in. In my situation, I am regularly putting data into a database (PostgreSQL with UTF-8 encoding) or working with Sublime Text (on all three platforms). You try to pass crap along to those and they explode. You HAVE to deal with crappy input.<p>In my experience, Python 2 explodes at run time when you get weird crappily-encoded data. And only your end users see it, and it is a huge pain to reproduce and handle. Python 3 forces you to write code that can handle the decoding at the get go. By porting my Python 2 to 3, I uncovered a bunch of places where I was just passing the buck on encoding issues. Python 3 forced me to address the issues.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are bugs and annoyances along the way with Python 3. Oh well. Dealing with text input in any language is a pain. Having worked with Python, C, Ruby and PHP and dealing with properly handling &quot;input&quot; for things like FTP, IMAP, SMTP, HTTP, etc, yeah, it sucks. Transliterating, converting between encodings, wide chars, Windows APIs. Fun stuff. It isn&#x27;t really Python 3 that is the problem, it is undefined input.<p>Unfortunately, it seems Armin happens to play in areas where people play fast and loose (or are completely oblivious to encodings). There is probably more pain generally there than dealing with transporting data from native UI widgets to databases. Sorry dude.<p>Anyway, I never write Python 2 anymore because I hate having this randomly explode for end-users and having to try and trace down the path of text through thousands of lines of code. Python 3 makes it easy for me because I can&#x27;t just pass bytes along as if they were Unicode, I have to deal with crappy input and ask the user what to do.<p>Python 2 is a dead end with all sorts of issues. The SSL support in Python 2 is a joke compared to 3. You can&#x27;t re-use SSL contexts without installing the cryptography package, which requires, cffi, pycparsers and bunch of other crap. Python 2 SSL verification didn&#x27;t exist unless you roll your own, or use Requests. Except Requests didn&#x27;t even support HTTPS proxies until less than a year ago.<p>Good riddance Python 2.",1399907462

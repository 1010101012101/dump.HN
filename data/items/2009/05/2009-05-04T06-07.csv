592073,comment,591221,591221,0,0,krschultz,,,"One of the problems with this argument - competence. I'm sure all the people reading HN who are not far behind their manager. But that is not the case at a lot of places. Sometimes the wisdom of a well experience manager solves a problem better than those working for him could have. As a young engineer surrounded by those I consider well experienced, I often turn to those above when I have a decision to make. The questions they ask me often lead me to things I hadn't thought about yet.",1241420378

Wright and/or Algonquin Peak via Avalanche Pass is a stunningly beautiful hike.  Wright Peak, the easier of the two, is a little tougher than I'd recommend if you've never been up a mountain before, but with a bare minimum of experience (I'm talking a couple weeks at most), most healthy adults ought to be able to manage it as a day hike.<p>One particularly neat thing about Wright Peak is that in 1962, a B-47 bomber crashed into it near the summit, and you can still find bits of wreckage scattered about.",1241420374

This is an all at once thing.<p>You obviously don't know people going through this so let me paint you a vivid picture.<p>My grandfather died in March 2008. His home wasn't an investment, it was the house had had lived in for 40 years. He paid $340,000 for it. We have been trying to sell the house for over a year, we finally sold it this month for $150,000.<p>That is the housing market right now in a nutshell. It doesn't really matter to us because the estate is a gift to us, not our own money really.<p>But now flip the coin to the people who ""normal"" home buyers. Say I moved into that house 10 years ago and now my job is gone. I want to sell that house and move somewhere else. What am I going to do if I bought the home for 340k and have to sell it for 150k. I owe the bank almost 200k. I'm not an ""investor"", I have a wife and two kids and all we want to do is get out of our house. We didn't buy it as an investment and we played by the rules, but now we are completely and utterly screwed.<p>It has nothing to with investing. It has to do with putting a roof over your kids, and the expectation that if society won't burn to the ground around you. For people underwater in their homes - society has basically crashed and burned around them. They are basically trapped in their current situation whether they want to be there or not with only one way out - default.<p>People love to blame sub-prime borrowers who shouldn't be in homes, or speculators who shouldn't have bought homes. Sure those guys lifted the prices that everyone had to pay, but the VAST MAJORITY of homes bought during the bubble were still primary residences for people, and all of those regular families are now the victim in this situation.<p>Ignoring those problems is to be either incredibly out of touch, incredibly stupid, or incredibly callous.",1241419346

I ended up taking a job with an existing startup, but at the time my first priority was being able to eat :)<p>If I were you, I would not move here to do the solo founder thing without having plenty of connections; you need a good support network (which will hook you up with contract gigs too.) Bring a co-founder or hook up with some people who are already here and can introduce you.<p>That said, just being young and having the balls to move out here and give it a shot will open doors for you. Network aggressively, who knows?<p>As far as tips go: 
You can get a room for $500-$700 a month with varying levels of sketchiness; there are enough hacker houses around that you might find something helpful if you trawl CL long enough. Food is a matter of how gnarly you're willing to get :)<p>Don't bring your car and don't bring a bunch of gear; parking will cost you upwards of $150/mo and it's never included, and gearwise there's a non-trivial possibility you'll need to move fast if you're doing a cheap sublet or hosteling it.",1241419064

592044,comment,591897,591950,0,0,triplefox,,,"Indeed, the article doesn't really address anything. It basically concludes on the ""sufficiently smart compiler"" fallacy. Compilers only get better after you throw tons of engineering resources on them, and that situation only occurs after a language gains tremendous popularity for other reasons.<p>For example, both Python and Ruby have less-than-ideal implementations, and the avoidable flaws in their design are well known. Despite that, it's taken a long time to get to the point where anyone is even motivated to work on a reimplementation.<p>And on the other hand, Lisp has had scores of implementations, but it still can't reliably earn the prized ""equal/better to C"" benchmark scores. This if nothing else should inform us that performance considerations definitely do come into play at the language-design level.",1241418065

I constantly worried I wasn&#x27;t doing enough, and I frequently felt guilted with respect to &quot;not putting enough into the relationship&quot; which is probably my fault for not establishing boundaries early on. When we saw each other on bi-monthly trips, I still had to get work done (CS, other classes) and I was constantly guilted into &quot;you should&#x27;ve done it before the trip!&quot;<p>Originally the plan was for me to go down to go to her after I graduated (to Florida) but I got an interview for an internship in NYC, which I performed well in, which was converted into my receiving a full-time offer in Manhattan. I accepted since it is at a firm I wanted to work for since I was in high school. Literally my dream job. She was open to the idea of moving up with me but she enrolled in an academic program that would have added another 2 years of an LDR after already 1.5 years. She was perpetually sad over the summer when I interned in NYC (she was living with me for a month) because we couldn&#x27;t spend time together even though my working hours were quite good compared to my friends in Seattle and Palo Alto, and I realized my ambitions were met with ambiguity and a slow-growing resentment.<p>The pushing back of an &quot;end date&quot; for longer and longer eventually led to my feeling that overall it would be healthier to end it, additionally considering the changes that happened in our lives over the course of the relationship. That being said our goals had also diverged significantly.<p>I knew what was important to me so I decided that it was best to move on since our long-term goals were no longer aligned, but it was an incredible experience that I&#x27;m lucky to have had. Not everyone gets to meet someone that, for a time, they connect with so well. I look at it as a learning experience that has made me a better person which I&#x27;m told is the best perspective to have.",1424591866

Freed men aren&#x27;t property. Free men have never been property.<p>Here are a couple more interesting clauses:<p><pre><code>    108. If a tavern-keeper (feminine) does not accept corn according to gross weight\n         in payment of drink, but takes money, and the price of the drink is less\n         than that of the corn, she shall be convicted and thrown into the water.\n\n    114.

Striking, without necessarily injuring, a man higher in rank is a &quot;criminal&quot; offense.

Demanding goods or money, by force, from someone who doesn&#x27;t owe you anything is a civil offense, and a fairly minor one going by the fine.<p>And, again, there is no cultural continuity from mesopotamia to modern europe or america. Similarity between Hammurabi&#x27;s Code and the English common law does not represent influence of one on the other, it represents parallel evolution. It is therefore no more and no less relevant to understanding the common law than, say, early Indian law, or 1700s Japanese law.",1424589904

9088598,comment,9087037,9087619,0,0,KeytarHero,,,"A little OT because it&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re doing in this case case, but...<p>The NES and SNES (and I&#x27;m guessing other cartridge-based consoles) supported having extra chips (often called &quot;mappers&quot;) inside the cartridge that would add extra hardware capabilities beyond what the console could do by itself. Basic mappers could switch between different ROM banks, effectively allowing games to have larger ROMs than the console would normally allow. Later, some cartridges would have co-processors that did some of the computation inside the cartridge itself in order to enhance graphics capabilities. That&#x27;s how the original StarFox was able to run on Super NES, despite the SNES not supporting 3D polygon rendering.<p>For a while[1], I&#x27;ve wondered what a NES would be capable of if you used a modern ARM SoC - say, a Raspberry Pi - as a mapper. For one, you could make a NES game with WiFi support (you wouldn&#x27;t even need an ARM chip for that, just an ESP8266 should be able to do the basics). I&#x27;m not sure if this is possible, but in theory you could even do all rendering on the ARM chip and output the image directly to the video buffer, effectively allowing you to do just about any graphics the SoC can do. As for audio, on the Famicom (the Japanese NES), there were actually extra analog audio pins for cartridges that would allow a cartridge to output any audio it could generate. The NES doesn&#x27;t have these pins, but I think you could still do higher-quality audio than the NES is normally capable of by rapidly changing the DMC channel.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about NES programming nor really anything about its video hardware, but this is still an idea I&#x27;ve had in the back of my mind for a while.<p>I know some people might ask &quot;What&#x27;s the point? All you&#x27;re doing is making it harder to use a Raspberry Pi!&quot;, but I think it would be pretty cool to say you did all that with something that&#x27;s technically a valid NES cartridge running on an unmodified NES.<p>[1] really, I first got this idea when I saw Google Maps&#x27; 2012 April Fools joke - I started thinking about how a NES-based Google Maps would technically be possible",1424589635

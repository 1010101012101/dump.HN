The problem with toggles is you need a very short description.  (on/off, yes/no, etc)<p>Worse, for those of us not developing only for the iPhone, there are drawbacks.  There are javascript and jQuery solutions for this.  But then you need to require javascript and download some images and it adds complexity, makes things more fragile, is harder to maintain, adds concerns over compatibility, and I don't even know if there are performance issues.<p>So I guess there are some trade offs.",1286596698

1774301,comment,1774156,1774253,0,0,adamc,,,"Your question more or less assumes that standardization is the right answer. Let's start a step or two back: Do we need to measure students and teachers at all? Presuming we do, why do we need to do it via standardized tests? Do they even measure what we want to know?<p>My daughter goes to a school that does well by these measures. It _is_ a good school, but the teachers basically teach to the test* -- given the rather punitive structure of the laws, they don't have much choice. Performance is directly tied to funding. Is that really the best way to teach kids? I'm doubtful.<p>I think we do need good teachers, but I'm not at all convinced that test scores are a good way to measure that, anymore than lines of code are a good way to measure programmers. I do want kids to learn, but I'm not very convinced this is the best route to that.<p>I don't think there is any easy solution. Kids with parents who value education tend to do better -- that's a huge factor. Resources certainly help; those of us who care tend to live in better school districts (often with higher tax rates) -- is that really a sensible way to run the schools? I mean, it works for me, but why should we under-resource kids whose parents don't care about education? But there is no doubt that you can pour money at this problem and get nowhere if you spend it poorly. (That's true of all problems, though.)<p>All this emphasis on education can go overboard. Where I live, even in grade school they get only one short recess a day (unlike the two, slightly longer, ones I grew up with). Does that make sense? In a nation with a national obesity epidemic? And, even in very early grades, they come home with a LOT of homework. When are they supposed to go outside and play?<p>*I don't mean they literally teach the tests, but they certainly spend a lot of time structuring their materials around the way test questions are phrased, and in teaching kids test-taking strategies. Do I think fourth-graders should need to learn how to take tests? No.",1286596146

Then I realized that your argument is an argument against your argument.<p>Good teachers engage their students and make them think about problems around them and how to solve them.  They present history as then ask if it's happening again around them.  They teach English and then explain why learning the proper way to talk and write helps make their own expressions more poignant and well received.<p>In today's school system's the teachers are judged solely on the test scores of students and it's unheard of that a student might simply be a 'c' student instead of being the teachers fault.  Teachers have to teach the tests and no longer have the proper time to teach theory and critical thinking.  School lengths change at the whim of the school board depending on why survey has been read saying that 50 min classes are better than 90 min and so on.  The school system has become a political playground and we are seeing the result of focusing on 'grades' over education.",1286596079

1774245,comment,1773515,1773515,0,0,malandrew,,,"UserVoice for congressional districts as an alternative to lobbyists.<p>The idea is to use technology to disrupt traditional lobbying to the point that it is more difficult for the bad lobbyists to have a negative impact.<p>With the science of reputation and filtering systems getting better by the day, one solution might be a service that makes everyone a potential lobbyist. There are about 118,000 citizens per pair of ears in Washington according to Clay Johnson, author of the blog InfoVegan. The website I am suggesting would allow all 118,000 people an equal chance to voice their opinion. Those 118,000 opinions are then voted one by those same 118,000 people. The most upvoted items ""float"" to the top and get past the filter to the Congressman or Congresswoman's ears.<p>If you also make it so that people can't link and vote for opinions directly, you remove the one major avenue used to game the system: one person with too much time or influence spreads the link to their idea to those likely to upvote it.<p>Instead the system can be designed like a double-blind experiment. Ideas are stripped of names of people and organizations. The system randomly assigns ideas already submitted to be upvoted or downvoted to all participants. A participants ideas does not get submitted for voting by others until they have ""bought"" that right by voting on the ideas of others. Participants get a limited number of upvotes and downvotes to use, thus preventing them from giving out too many of one or the other and being forced to make a judgment call.<p>Those are a few ideas, but there is no reason the mechanics of voting and reputation systems can't be used for this end.<p>As I said above, this is a bit like UserVoice for government in that it allows users (citizens) to ""lobby"" the product managers (congressmen and congresswomen) for product feature requests and improvements.",1286594573

I am trying to pursue an idea of making these forms available online so that the customer can just fill the form, make a new appointment and just visit the dentistry.  This will save time of the patient and time of the dentist as well.  I've asked some receptionist who work at dental offices and have found out that data provided by the new patient in hand written application format is again entered into the system either by the receptionists or someone else.  It is at times entered either into the insurance form generator or just an internal DB to keep record.<p>I am still figuring out all the unanswered questions I have, however, the biggest question I have is: ""Is it a viable idea, given the assumption that I'll be dealing with medical data?""

It is one thing to joke about wishing harm to a government, but once you step outside the established process for instituting change legally in the government to one where you seek to force change you will find that the 'rules of engagement' with respect to the Government's response have changed in favor of the Government.<p>Many of those new rules have specific exemptions carved out so that the folks in charge no longer are bound by protecting your 'rights' as specified by the Constitution.<p>From the form [1] the Justice department fills out with respect to people it is trying for treason, reasons to ask for the death penalty include:<p>Grave risk to national security  --  In the commission of the offense, the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of substantial danger to national security.<p>And we have the Pentagon recently saying that by policy a 'cyber attack' will be considered an act of war.<p>Grave risk of death  --  In the commission of the offense, the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person.<p>And since the military depends on its network systems to prosecute warfare they will argue an attack on these systems puts warfighters (their word for soldiers) into grave risk of death.<p>There are even this 'bonus' modifiers for treason like:<p>Obstruction of justice.  The victim was killed in an effort by the defendant to obstruct justice, tamper with a witness or juror, or <i>in retaliation for cooperating with authorities.</i><p>Where they will argue that if some punks DDoS DoD contractor's computers in retaliation, it might result in disrupting the computers that fly the predators over a battlefield for example.<p>However, I suspect it's a hoax.

2630803,comment,2630388,2630676,22,0,jonnathanson,,,"While I support the endorsement of Amazon's data-driven culture and strategy, I don't think it's fair to describe Apple as its opposite. Apple is not the gut-driven, ""bet the company"" firm that the general public seems to think it is. Its bets are very data-driven, albeit not quite as real-time-data-driven as a company like Amazon's, whose business model allows for more real time data in the first place.<p>In broad strokes, I think I'd describe the two companies this way: Amazon innovates through optimization of new markets, while Apple innovates through creating new markets. This isn't a wholly fair description of either company, and as we know, there are exceptions in either direction. But that's the business model of the two companies at a 30,000-foot glance.<p>As you've hinted, probably the best way to differentiate the strategies of the two companies is on the risk/reward dimension. Amazon operates on a risk-minimization model, while Apple is risk-seeking in favor of outsized rewards. This is partially because Apple is still a hardware company (for now, at least), and it needs to keep reinventing its products to stay ahead of the commoditization of hardware.",1307479934

2630801,comment,2628559,2628954,2,0,reemrevnivek,,,"x64 uses a complex instruction set, which has a huge number of instructions that can do non-primitive operations in one step.  ARM uses a reduced instruction set, which limits the available operations to basic load, store, arithmetic (on register data only), and a couple jump/branch instructions.  These design philosophies are incompatible.  An x64 chip would be spinning its wheels, wasting power, if it tried to run ARM assembly.  An ARM chip would have to virtualize a huge percentage of the operations that an x64 chip would do in a single instruction, and would be painfully slow, mitigating any power savings it might have.  ARM will never run x64 binaries.  Good thing you're not holding your breath.<p>This is why we write portable code in higher-level languages that can be compiled for both architectures.<p>Not sure that Android is a motivating factor for Adobe to produce code for desktop Linux, though.

2630736,comment,2630042,2630042,13,0,jerf,,,"While we've never had a full-color screen in our hands with a console, we have had <i>displays</i> in our hands before, with the Dreamcast. I would consider it a bit of a warning that the Dreamcast's promises of how the display would be useful almost entirely failed to pan out. I think the core problem is that on average, you're not going to split your attention between two screens, if for no other reason than physically acquiring a screen with your eyes is a significant fraction of a second. The fraction of a second spent changing screens better have a really good payoff.<p>For every use case given for the auxiliary screen, I'd ask, could it have been done on the Dreamcast (even if not quite as well), and if so, why didn't it work there and why will it work on the WiiU? Merely saying ""now it's in color"" really isn't good enough, I think.<p>I can generate hypothetical uses as much as the next guy (""call plays in sports games!"" ""multiplayer shooters!"" ""rear-view windows!""), but once I tone down the excitement (easy after years of practice) and really think about the pragmatic issues of trying to use this auxiliary screen, I'm not actually coming up with many situations in which the auxiliary screen is the <i>best solution</i>, which is the real criterion to measure uses of it by, as opposed to <i>a</i> solution. Play calling works, but that's an awfully elaborate screen for such a use case. Rear-view displays don't work at all. Locally multiplayer shooters are OK, but what will the main screen be doing?<p>An example in the current generation: Light gun games are best with motion controllers (haven't tried Move but assume it will be at least as good as the Wii), because that game style really uses the controls, a two-dimensional high-speed directional input system that can harness muscle memory; with only a little practice I can flick reliably from one side of the screen to another and it isn't long before there is no longer any barrier between where I am thinking the reticle should be, and where my muscles are putting it. I have never had such fun with this genre as I have on the Wii. Motion controls are not merely <i>a</i> solution, but are the <i>best</i> solution, beating out even ""badly-calibrated arcade gun without on-screen reticle"". Whereas ""wiggle the stick to attack"" is not an argument in favor of motion controls, because while it is <i>a</i> solution, it is not the <i>best</i> solution, and the Wii's reputation has suffered from the number of games that have tacked this on so they can claim ""motion control"". Motion control as a whole has had a big problem with being a solution instead of the best solution. Given the price of the screen here, both in dollars and in controller comfort, I don't see it being the best solution to enough problems to make it worth it.<p>(Opinion calibration: I was actually up on the Wii, precisely because motion control really did open a lot of things up, and I consider it still underused. Unfortunately, sophisticated uses rapidly become very complicated AI problems to try to figure out what it is you actually meant. I'm also at least modestly up on the 3DS' long term potential, but it's going to take probably 2 full game generations before the developers themselves get over seeing it as a gimmick and start ""truly"" developing for it. I don't consider myself a reflexive naysayer. I really do think this isn't very likely to turn out to be useful for games, though. But I could be wrong; this could be the iPad of the space.

This guy needs to leverage his freeloaders to promote the visibility of his stuff and be smarter about providing people with opportunities to pay him.

In much of Europe, cycling is seen primarily as a mode of transport rather than a leisure activity. Rohloff's target customer rides several thousand kilometres a year, often because cycling is their sole mode of transport or because they live long-term as a cycle tourist.<p>There's a term in the bicycle trade, ""Bicycle Shaped Object"". It refers to bicycles built as cheaply as possible for exactly the customer you have in mind - people who ride a few times a year, usually buying a bike on impulse at a supermarket. Most BSOs are built to such a poor standard that they are unsafe to ride in traffic and will last no more than a few hundred kilometres.<p>To a lot of people in the bike business, the BSO represents everything they loathe in the world. The bicycle is a machine of pure liberation - a mode of transport that is practically free, that prolongs your life, that doesn't harm the environment and that helps you better engage with the world around you. The BSO crudely imitates the bicycle, selling a vision of freedom and health to people who will never experience either.<p>I'm not a leftist, in fact my politics border on Thatcherism, but I believe that business exists to serve humanity and not vice-versa. We get the sort of business we demand. Personally, I prefer businesses that treat their employees properly and do right by their customers, that value sustainability and longevity, that seek to serve their community.

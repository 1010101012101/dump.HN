Interesting analysis.<p>Still, I think it proves my point that you can always blame the government if you want to.<p>In my view, the reasoning has one major flaw.

If the cause was the Dutch monetary policy, then there should have been other bubbles contemporary with the monetary policy.<p>As far as I understand it, the tulipmania did not cause a recession or depression even if some very rich people lost all their money.

804052,comment,803201,803655,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"Yeah, the fact that it searches for terms you don't type in has really been annoying me for a while. You essentially have to put a <i>+</i> in front of every term in a technical search. I have to say, though, it makes sense for non-technical users, who are apt to type in misspelled and suboptimal terms. For the vast majority of users, Google probably knows better than they do what they should be searching for. Also, I think this change may have evolved as a more generic implementation of an attempt at stemming. For example, it makes sense for Google to additionally search for <i>stereos</i> when you enter <i>stereo</i>, and <i>brings</i>, <i>bringing</i>, and <i>brought</i> (and probably <i>brang</i> and <i>brung</i>) when you search for <i>bring</i>.<p>Another bugaboo of mine, though, is the fact that hyphenating words no longer acts the same as putting them in quotes.

804020,comment,803715,803715,0,0,pyre,,,"The real issue is that there is no discussion happening between Apple's AppStore approval staff and the developers.  If there was 2-way communication between the two the developer would know fairly quickly whether or not this was Apple having an over-reachingly broad policy, or just an Apple employee misinterpreting the policy.<p>I think that Apple is running into the same problem that the patent office has.  Everybody can't be an expert on everything, and it's increasingly expensive to hire experts to do mind-numbingly boring work like shuffling through applications (software or patent) to approve based on rather broad criteria.  Not only that, but there is pressure to just push things through the pipeline (whether they are approved or rejected).<p>In this case, it's entirely possible that the employee that rejected the app knows there is a program called Bitwise, and thought that this app was trying to tag along on that popularity (I guess?) not realizing that bitwise is a generic term.  It might be a different story if he was <i>naming</i> his app Bitwise, vs just adding it as a search keyword.<p>But all of this could be solved through 2-way communication and making AppStore developers feel like valued business partners -- they are business partners with Apple afterall.  Even the US Patent Office -- for all its ills -- has an amount of communication between the patent reviewer and the patent applicant.<p>If the AppStore reviewer fired off an email or phone call to the developer saying, ""Your app seems great, but we don't like the keyword 'bitwise' in there because it's referring to another application,"" the developer could immediately respond with, ""But 'bitwise' is a generic term that describes the functionality of my app. Wikipedia/Google it.""<p>As it stands, the developer feels like Apple is talking down to him/her from 'on high,' decreeing that this app does not seem worthy of the AppStore.  Without communication, the developer feels powerless to affect the outcome of the approval process, and gets frustrated at minor details like this which would probably be cleared up over a couple of emails instead of forcing the developer to resubmit his app in the 'Apple approved way' (even though his way might be perfectly fine, and the reviewer was only mistaken).",1252026549

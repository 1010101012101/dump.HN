By contrast, training skilled workers (might be) a long-term structural fix.  But this essentially limits the useful on-the-ground volunteers to those able to teach skills, rather than those willing to do unskilled labor.<p>I think this piece (plus the excellent comments) is a good summary of both sides of the argument: <a href=""http://mitpsc.mit.edu/globalchallenge/?p=335"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpsc.mit.edu/globalchallenge/?p=335</a>",1434761967

9748501,comment,9747131,9747181,0,0,philipn,,,"This is a really common argument that people make, but I think it&#x27;s missing some essential externalities.  I&#x27;ve worked in the nonprofit space for ~7 years now, and this is the most common over-cocktails argument folks tend to make.<p>First of all, and most importantly, most people do not give very much of their income away.  And as you accumulate more money, your rate of giving tends to decrease.  There are counter examples, thankfully (!), but this tends to be the trend.<p>There are also very important questions about the counter force of the labor you engage in to earn money.  &quot;Wall Street&quot; type jobs make a great example here: say you earn $1M in a year by, say, funding expansive oil palm plantation development in southeast asian peat swamps.  You may end up giving away a generous (!) 10% of your after-tax earnings, but you probably won&#x27;t make up for the negative impact that you, or your money, had.<p>This particular externality is huge when you think about how investment works. For instance, all the major charitable foundations have large endowments that are tied up in various capital markets.  Almost all of these foundations only give away their legally-mandated 5% payout amount.  All the while, their complex financial machinery is generating, on average, returns in excess, or close to, 5%.  So 95% of their money is actually working to make more money through the whole expansive and environmentally destructive capitalism thing[1].<p>Working at a soup kitchen full-time when you posses important skills does seem silly, though[2].  Like everything, I think there&#x27;s a balance here.  For instance, if you&#x27;re highly skilled, donating a percentage of your time to volunteer or work at a lower-than-market-or-just-market salary at a nonprofit you believe in can have a tremendously important impact.<p>1. Not all foundations do this.  A notable exception is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which I believe has a long-term goal of giving away all of their assets in some finite time period.  A mixture of private investment in areas of interest can also help, e.g. what Omidyar Network does a lot of (<a href=""http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2014/3/27/cant-get-a-grip-on-omidyar-philanthropy-youre-not-alone-so-t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2014/3/2...</a>)",1434761800

A lot of that is because pretty much everyone I know who&#x27;s done some kind of long-term charity work clearly <i>was</i> doing that (went off to the third world because they didn&#x27;t get the internship/job they were applying for, or are angling to get into DC/politics or somesuch).",1434761796

It is a case in point of the political incursion on science that Matt Ridley was describing in the linked article.<p>I have good reason to believe that the insinuations against Dr. Wei Hock Soon are both damaging and false, and indeed, actionable. They are part of a campaign instigated since 1997 by one Kert Davies, research director of Greenpeace, to mob and harass Dr. Soon, isolate him by putting pressure on his employer to fire him, to cause sponsors to drop him, and destroy his reputation. Added to that, the stress from this attack is worsening his ill health.<p><a href=""https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/defense-dr-willie-soon-politically-motivated-attacks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/defense-dr-willie...</a><p>>Contrary to media reports, the grants from “energy interests” used to support Dr. Soon’s research were solicited and received by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, not by Dr. Soon himself. The Smithsonian staff vetted and approved every grant and then kept about 40 percent of the total as a fee for acting as a fire wall between a donor and the researcher.<p>>Prior to conducting research on behalf of the Smithsonian, Dr. Soon would draw up a grant proposal that summarized the scientific questions he planned to research. Third-party entities interested in funding the research made their interest known to the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian then vetted the research proposal and grant offers to ensure the research was scientifically proper and would not present any conflicts of interest. Only after conducting the vetting process did the Smithsonian authorize the research and the funding. The third-party funders wrote their checks directly to the Smithsonian, which was the grant recipient. The Smithsonian then distributed a portion of the grant money (usually a little more than half) to Dr. Soon as payment for his services<p>The term &#x27;deliverables&#x27; mentioned in the offending comment above (which insinuates that Dr. Soon is &#x27;delivering&#x27; scientific conclusions made to order) comes from the contract between the donors and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (not Dr. Soon), and refers to progress reports and early access to material in preparation for publication.",1434761753

You can use O_DIRECT and get async IO that way, but that completely bypasses the OS cache, so it&#x27;s not a great way to do it, at least not for nginx. Just read the article to see the details.<p>Note that kqueue(2) in BSD-land supports a unified interface for async IO for both sockets and files, so you can have a proper event loop without having to resort to reading files in a thread pool. If Linux had something similar, a nginx wouldn&#x27;t need to integrate a threadpool for this (though it might for other things, such as CPU-intensive plugins).",1434761674

The seller may have them listed on Stubhub, or NBAtickets.com (AKA TicketExchange/Ticketsnow), or on Ticket Network, or any combination of those or other resale sites.<p>With all Stubhub instant-fulfillment listings and TicketExchange listings, the details of the seats are listed <i>right down to the seat numbers</i>.<p>So, an aggregating mobile app could scan the primary sites to harvest unsold listing details as the event approaches (or, in the case of Stubhub, most events for which they don&#x27;t control ticketing stay up for up to an <i>hour after</i> the start time) and tell the user that those seats are unsold (and therefore unlikely to be legitimately occupied).<p>Sadly, this is going on right now - there are third party sites which are scanning prime unsold seats and taking existing valid cheap-seat tickets and <i>editing the section and row details</i> to match the unsold listing,then selling those cheap seats as the better seats.

What they need, right now, is people that know how to manage, run finances, computer networking.

Case in point: another friend of mine was in a relationship with a hardcore Anarchist for 5 years, and came from a poorish middle-class background herself. She&#x27;d worked shitty working class jobs. She was pretty exposed to the plight of the poor and aware of poverty issues. Then she got a job in banking.

Complaining that despite her tax load (seriously, got a raise, and all she could do was complain), she still had to help out her single-mother sister with money.

I&#x27;m not familiar with FB&#x27;s Folly but at a glance I don&#x27;t see it solving the fundamental problems with both std::future and callback-hell; .then() seems to just move callback-hell into one place rather than having it spread out -- it&#x27;s still hell. std::future on the other hand is tied directly to the OS thread interface. Are you able to .wait() on say, 1,000,000 items at once? You&#x27;d either need 1,000,000 threads or you&#x27;re bound by the slowest waiting entity in the current thread. It&#x27;s definitely flawed.<p>The solution is to once again break down the execution context. Like threads did with processes, a new division is necessary in userspace based on stackful context switching (think boost::context crossed with boost::asio using the yield_context feature). Userspace contexts can &quot;go to sleep&quot; and &quot;wake up&quot; while being agnostic to the bounds of the thread-pool, and working fine on even a single thread. This model allows synchronous-looking programming while really acting in an asynchronous way -- which is what the obsoleted OS process/thread system offered.<p>&quot;Async&quot; and &quot;callbacks&quot; are really just a model of no-model -- it hasn&#x27;t inverted the stack, it&#x27;s basically eliminated it -- and I treat it as nothing more than temporary.",1434760275

However, once the development team started working on the issue (with upper management on their case), I deliberately ratcheted down the pressure.<p>I did this by stopping all emails from being cc&#x27;ed to managers, and I acknowledged that the team working on the project were under pressure but that my only goal was to get a fix and frankly I wasn&#x27;t interested in blame, only a result. When I took out the managers from the email I also told the devs that I appreciated their work, and from this point I&#x27;d work with them cooperatively, and that I would give them space to deal with the problem without constant distractions from managers asking for updates.<p>The dev team worked on the issue and fixed it a few hours before the start of the business day and I verified the fix. Then I sent an email to their team acknowledging the fix, and the effort they had put into it - only at this point I copied all the orginal managers to the email.<p>Yesterday I discovered the dev team had done a review of every case I&#x27;d ever opened to them, found some additional problems which they fixed without me asking, and then ensured all open cases got a status update and were being actively worked on.<p>You capture more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.

But we could come up with a similar API allowing the debugger to pass in a representation of the JavaScript stack to a stack deobfuscator and get back a language-specific representation of the stack for display; it&#x27;s basically the same thing. (A complication: when a program is written in multiple languages that call each other, we need to figure out which language each portion of the stack belongs to.) Stack frames are often not one-to-one either due to inlining and variable reuse, but for a given stack frame and a given location in the source code, there will be some interpretation of the JavaScript stack frame that makes sense.<p>The idea is that the reflection library has all the language-specific knowledge baked in, because a compiler generates a different .js file containing debugging information for each program, just as it generates a source map today.<p>More generally, any information sent as a data file can just as easily be sent as a JavaScript file if we can come up with a suitable API.

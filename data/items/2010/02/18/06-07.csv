1133601,comment,1133555,1133555,0,0,yurisagalov,,,"Every so often an article crops up discussing Yahoo's popularity, and I am again and again amazed at the fact that so many people still visit Yahoo in general. I haven't used their portal since late 1999, and I don't know many other people who do. There are a few ancient relics out there who still use yahoo mail, but even they seem to be fewer and further between (somehow gmail just appears to be more...professional, My friends would put gmail on their resume, but would not be caught dead with a yahoo mail account... it is akin to a hotmail account for professional purposes)...<p>I would <i>really</i> love to see a thorough study of yahoo demographics and traffic driven, as well as how much of it is actually through partnerships (in Canada, Rogers partners with yahoo, so they kind of force feed you a lot of their services through the yahoo portals) and not direct yahoo traffic.",1266476350

There are a <i>lot</i> of different kinds of coders out there, and many should not waste their time learning anything about visual design.<p>For instance I find myself in back end roles.  Take my current job.  That is a mix of analyzing software for what needs to be monitored, writing said monitoring, and fixing or escalating when said monitoring indicates that something has gone wrong.<p>Nothing I do comes anywhere near anything resembling an end user.  So what point is there in my learning about graphic design?<p>On the other hand every good person I know who does front end development also knows something of design.  If for no other reason than to establish a common language with the designer.<p>But taking your point one step farther, I think it is important that everyone learn something about the jobs of the people we interact with every day.",1266476350

1133598,comment,1133510,1133558,0,0,patio11,,,"I apologize in advance if any of this is repetitive with things I have said before:<p>1)  There is a difference between what you and I think are really stupid little things and what reality thinks are really stupid little things.  For example, I think it is likely that you can (with a suitable A/B testing framework) change a call to action on your site in under five minutes of coding, counting the time to redeploy.  Many engineers would consider that a stupid little change.  Empirically, exactly that test has resulted in double-digit improvements before.  So totally do that.<p>2)  An A/B test which leads to the result ""Not enough data to tell"" doesn't convey zero information.  It conveys an important bit of information: ""Well, neither of these two alternatives lit a fire in the hearts of my users.""  That should give you the ability to recalibrate your efforts in the future.<p>3)  With the context that I run a very part-time business: for the last couple of years I aimed at doing four A/B tests a month and getting a 5% increase out of one of them.  If the other three end without significantly significant results, oh well.  (See <a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo/results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo/results</a> -- one in four isn't too far off what I actually get.  Nota bene that is a convenience sampling of results I've actually accumulated, not all of them.)  Of more applicability to you: you have to accept that A/B testing is a process which converges on awesome rather than a button which is onclick: deliverTheAwesome().  Over time, I promise you, it really does work.  (It almost can't <i>not</i> work.)  However, individual tests will frequently return null result or tell you that the new code you just spent time writing is a waste.<p>4)  I try to avoid doing tests that take a week to set up unless I have a good reason to suspect it is going to seriously move the needle, because for the same amount of work you can throw a lot of smaller things at the wall and see what sticks.  For example, I've put off an A/B test that I absolutely have to do until I am gainfully unemployed just because of the implementation difficulty.  (A: current site selling online and downloadable software.  B: what are you talking about, thee is only an online version.)  Especially if you're new to A/B testing and don't have a good example that you can point to yourself and say ""Bemmu, you feel like quitting, but REMEMBER THIS?!  Oh good golly that worked out right.  Test on!"", test some stuff which takes 10 minutes to bang out alternatives for.   Conversion buttons, calls to action, positioning of buttons, that sort of thing.<p>5)  ""Things that really move the needle"" and ""things that take a lot of time to implement"" do not relate to each other.  In fact, they sometimes have so little relation it is hilarious.  Ask me how many weeks I have burned in developing features no one cares about versus how many minutes it took to change five words on my purchasing page.  (""Buy a single copy via ..."" -> ""Get instant access to ..."")  Sure, go ahead and test the button designs.  Let reality tell you what matters rather than thinking you have a good idea.  I haven't the furthest clue.",1266476275

1133594,comment,1133393,1133393,0,0,binspace,,,"It depends on what you want to do. The college CS curriculum typically is good for teaching students to become professors. If that is what you want, stick to CS.<p>If you want to go more toward the software engineer approach you have a few options. You can stick with CS, but try to work on actual projects. For example, you can contribute to an open source project or start a company. The main thing is to work on projects that aren't cookie-cutter tasks, such as the ones that are common in school.<p>Switching majors so you can learn something new is also a great option. What are your other interests? If you do go with the school route, you will probably learn more about problem solving by learning a new field. You can still use your programming skills with many majors.<p>Another option is to get a job. Frankly, I think college is overrated. School is good, but there it is not the only route. You could probably get a good position at a startup, and will probably learn more than in school.<p>I didn't get interested in programming until I was a sophomore in college. I graduated with a BS in Engineering Physics. I'm glad I didn't major in CS, and I was still able to pursue software development. You will have plenty of opportunities in school to try new things. I have to say that I have learned more about problem solving (at a faster rate) while in the workforce, than in school.",1266476035

Even with your partner wife etc. You need to find a method that works for you to cope.<p>During College I got terribly bored of lectures and was quite ahead of my class mates - and wouldn't be surprised some of the lecturers. I decided to infrequently attend lectures and studied for <i>exams</i> and <i>assignments</i> only. Piece of cake really to sail through. My social life improved by 1000%. I loved and love learning. I would go into the library and borrow all sort of interesting books from anthropology to physics (even dated one of the librarians). I was fortunate to study in London. Visited all the museums - the patent library (amazing). I worked part-time in a fish-and-chips shop (was a great experience to learn customer service). It was like physically surfing. I even took diving classes and went diving in a reservoir in Scotland. Really if you want not to be bored is easy. Refocus - you are there to earn a <i>degree</i> that is your target. Learning is a different and <i>solo</i> activity.<p>It is much more difficult if you get these feelings in your work. Again you can channel energy into other activities, you can put research into areas of your job that others consider routine. Changing a job would merely put you into a similar spot once the novelty wears out. Divide your efforts into<p><pre><code>  - must do\n  - this is my life things\n</code></pre>\nThe <i>must do</i> you do for survival and you handle them as best as you can.

Standard error = 0.00948683298. So with 95% confidence conversion rate is actually between 8.14% and 11.86%. I run an experiment on 1000 visitors and seemingly have a improved conversion rate of 11%. But with 95% confidence it is actually between 9.06% and 12.94%.

1133578,comment,1132666,1133180,0,0,cameldrv,,,"Yes, they do.  The supposed advantage of a twin engine plane is that you can fly if one quits.  The FAA makes you demonstrate that you can handle the plane on one engine before they turn you loose with a twin-engined plane, but the unfortunate reality is that the fatal accident rate for twin engined (small, piston) planes is worse than singles.  The problem is that the probability of an engine failure is twice as high in a twin as in a single.  In a single, if the engine quits, you're a glider, and the plane is fairly straightforward to handle.  As long as you don't hit anything too solid, you'll be OK if you keep the plane under control through the landing.   In a twin though, you have to do everything just right, or you can end up out of control and hit the ground nose down and die.<p>In most light twin planes, both props turn the same direction, and so the plane has a natural left-turning tendency when climbing.  If the left engine goes out, you're in a very bad situation, because now the plane really wants to go to the left.  If you indulge it, you don't get to go where you want.  If you don't, you may get a worse climb rate (which is already very bad.)",1266475524

The description is great, but there's one false note: <i>""If you were 'actually' traveling into the fractal your speed would be faster than the speed of light.""</i> 2 objections:<p>a) What is the speed of light in the mandelbrot set? What zoom level do you designate to be 1m?<p>b) The 'speed' the camera is traveling at is hugely variable. It's basically slowing down by an order of magnitude every constant window of time. So if the final image is 1m wide, you're travelling 10^n's of universes every second at the start. The above sentence doesn't come close to doing this idea justice.<p><i>Update</i>: the sentence is from the original at <a href=""http://vimeo.com/1908224"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/1908224</a><p>---<p>I went over the video a second time to see how often the camera 'steers'. The entire second half drops pretty much straight down a radially symmetrical 'well'. There's 2 obvious changes in bearing between 2 and 5 minutes. In the first 2 minutes it's harder to keep count because much of the time there's no radial symmetry. I suspect the bearing is changing almost constantly.<p>Summary: the video was made by choosing a point about 2 minutes worth of zoom in, and then pretty much dropping straight down, except for a couple of tacks. Whoever did this was probably trying to maximize the diversity of views; at any point in the video a different tack may have ended up back at something like the starting point much sooner.

So better to sell to 1% of 1,000,000 people than 100% of 50.<p>- A friend of mine has a relatively small site but sells to - and this is not a joke - a full 75% of his visitors. Plenty of them become repeat buyers, and his whole online store fits in a shoebox. There are always outliers to statistics such as these.",1266473997

Make sure you understand their papers and have intelligent questions for them.  Make them feel that you'll be useful.<p>2) Look into some of the theory.  Its probably quite different from what you've done in high school.  There is some fascinating CS theory out there.  Algorithms, turing machines, graph theory, etc... are beautiful fields.<p>3) Find a crazy minor.  By crazy, I mean non-technical.  Film, english, political science, etc...  You'll branch out, be more useful to any employer, be challenged and have fun.<p>4) Talk to your dean (someone else said this, but I think its a great idea).

For very tightly integrated things, I can believe that vertical integration is the optimal solution. But having to vertically integrate just because doing it any other way requires dealing with shit vendors seems to suggest a rather poorly functioning marketplace. If all Google wants is an off-the-shelf product with non-onerous licensing, but the only way to get that is to actually acquire a vendor because nobody will sell otherwise, that comes across as at least somewhat troubling.",1375919986

Think of it as a temporary political party. For every issue that is not core to these changes, the official stance is to defer those votes until the next election when someone from a different party gets into power.<p>Basically, the platform would be &quot;We don&#x27;t care about gun rights, we don&#x27;t care about religion, pro choice, pro-life, etc. For every one of these debates we will shelve or delay every bill so the status quo is maintained. None of these typical party issues will be considered at all. This is the everything political stays the same platform. The only thing we will address is the revolving door, regulatory capture, transparency, etc.&quot;<p>One thing I would love happen with respect to transparency is to have every single penny the government pays paid from a common purse that is searchable by any citizen and everything goes back to one individual who is accountable. Every single project that money is never disbursed to any organization to then manage the finances. Instead they get a set of cryptographic keys that allow them to make payments from the government account to every single supplier. Every single person spending a tax dollar can have their entire spending history reviewed. No secrecy anywhere. For every single entity you pay, you would have to declare whether you know personally (i.e. outside of work socially) any officer, owner or individual with a vested interest in that organization. All that is disclosed by penalty of perjury. If you lie some citizen will find out. That&#x27;s the kind of government we need.",1375919613

6176472,comment,6150773,6170968,1,0,Gormo,,,"> So that seems to be the crux of our disagreement.<p>I think we&#x27;re having two distinct disagreements here.<p>One of them is in our political <i>ideals</i>, and I think we can explore their respective differences to mutual benefit, so long as we agree on common definitions for the terminology we employ.  I do enjoy these kinds of debate and discussions as long as we&#x27;ve established a common ground of semantics, but if we&#x27;re talking past each other by using the same words as identifiers for substantively different ideas, the conversation can be tedious.<p>Which is where the <i>other</i> disagreement that I think we&#x27;re having comes into play: this conversation began when another commenter made a point about people who call Snowden a traitor doing so because they equate government with society.  It&#x27;s clear that in this context, and in the subsequent discussion we&#x27;ve had, that the words &quot;state&quot; and &quot;government&quot; <i>are</i> being used to reference a specific institution that exists for the purpose of concentrating and exercising top-down power.  If, in the context of conceptualizing your own political ideals, you use the word &quot;state&quot; to represent a different concept, that&#x27;s perfectly alright, as long as you recognize that it is indeed a divergence from the vernacular use of the term.<p>(Of course, if this is the case, and you do define the word &quot;state&quot; in your conceptual system to refer to the actual emergent order of civil society, then it would have made more sense to regard my distinction between state and society as a contradiction in terms, rather than &quot;the antithesis of democracy&quot;.)<p>All of that said, let&#x27;s get back to discussing the actual substance of our ideas.<p>> However, I also believe that it&#x27;s a good idea to have institutions like the UN, to function as a world government capable of speaking for all of humanity.<p>How, in your mind, is it possible to have a single institution, composed of a particualar set of people, that can &quot;speak for all of humanity&quot;?  There are billions of people - as soon as any two of them disagree on something, there&#x27;s no longer a single position with respect to that question that is adhered to be &quot;all of humanity&quot;.  And I&#x27;d wager good money that you can find at least one dispute with respect to the answer to <i>any</i> question; so how is it possible for there to even <i>be</i> anything to say for all of humanity?<p>And, I&#x27;ve got to wonder: if some institution is indeed somehow speaking <i>for</i> all of humanity, who could they possibly be speaking <i>to</i>?<p>> So... smaller? Not really. I agree with your list of &quot;families, friendships,&quot; etc., but I&#x27;m also happy with scaling the notion up to the species level, because there exist policies that we want to express at such a large scope.<p>Perhaps there are policies that <i>you</i> want to express at the &quot;species level&quot;, but there are none that <i>I</i> do, so the &quot;we&quot; is at best an exaggeration.  &quot;Families, friendships, etc.&quot; actually <i>are</i> substantive social contexts, but &quot;species&quot; is only an abstraction.<p>> The problem is that you can&#x27;t fully isolate problems.<p>The butterfly effect isn&#x27;t a useful justification for turning every question into one of universal scope.  Yes, there are things that may influence other things in incredibly remote and indirect ways, but we can still address matters by dealing with their direct proximate causes, and not by attempting to tweak every variable everywhere.  In fact, we can only effectively solve problems by dealing with their direct and proximate causes; we don&#x27;t actually have sufficent ability to comprehend, let alone adjust, phenomena at the macro level in order to effect outcomes at the micro level.  Problems that we can&#x27;t sufficiently isolate are problems that we can only effectively mitigate, not solve.<p>> Your local religious congregation has members who work in a few dozen different businesses, all of which serve the wider community and more than likely do business in even further communities.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you&#x27;re getting at here.  The religious congregation is one social context, the businesses are others, etc.  Their commonality is only the fact that some of the same individuals happen to participate in both social contexts.  Again, every <i>particular grouping</i> of people is a society unto itself; the actual participants in a business transactions are the ones involved in that social context, which has nothing to do with the religious congregation (unless the religious congregation is trading with them, anyway).<p>I think you&#x27;re treating social groups like permanent, immutable things, that exist independently of the specific people involved in them.  But that&#x27;s not how it really works: if someone new joins your weekly D&D club, then that D&D club is now a substantively different social context.  The equilibrium of expectations, understandings, etc. will have been shifted by the addition of a new person, bringing his own ideals, preferences, expectations, etc. into the setting.<p>> Something as simple as a teenager deciding to leave his parents because they&#x27;re stupid is going to call into question what kind of community-level support he can call upon to survive without his parents&#x27; blessing.<p>But he&#x27;s going to get that &quot;community-level support&quot; from an actual community - specific people with whom he establishes substantive relationships - and not from some abstraction mistakenly described as a &quot;community&quot;.<p>> Every manifested law is going to find some way to clash with other manifested law. Who mediates the disputes for this, and under what rule of law do those mediations take place?<p>The fact that the collision is taking place reveals that there must indeed be some overlap among the relevant social contexts, and that overlap is a social context unto itself, in which law can be &#x27;manifested&#x27; once more.  Traditionally, we have used judicial process as the primary way of doing this, when no common ground between the parties exists outside of the conflict itself; and traditionally judicial process has generated law in a bottom-up emergent fashion.<p>As I mentioned earlier, we have many centuries of effective use of common law and equity as evidence that such a system works quite well; the experiment with supplanting law with legislated policy over the past century hasn&#x27;t worked out quite so well, and indeed has often caused conflicts to escalate and to cause collateral damage to those who weren&#x27;t party to the initial conflict in the first place.<p>> And I object to that. In a democracy, there shouldn&#x27;t be prescriptive rules imposed by a small group onto the majority.<p>Nor should there be prescriptive rules imposed by &quot;the majority&quot; onto a &quot;small group&quot;.  Where people can&#x27;t agree, they should agree to disagree, and disentangle themselves from each other to the extent that their values are incompatible.<p>But you are using the word &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; here, indicating a normative ideal.  The word &quot;state&quot; in vernacular English, absolutely does describe the pattern that you don&#x27;t want to exist.  I don&#x27;t want it to exist either, but I recognize that it does, and that it is, at least in this instance, a consequence of an attempt at a democratic system which failed in part because the ideology of democracy was successfuly leveraged to justify exercise of power, instead of regarded as a mechanism to constrain power.<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s important, I feel, to aspire towards democracy rather than resign ourselves to it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m somewhat sympathetic to this aspiration, but I don&#x27;t concede to make mere democracy the pricipal aspiration of political life.  We don&#x27;t create political processes in order to give everyone an opportunity  in political processes; democracy is merely a mechanism, or an instrumentality, that we use in pursuit of more fundamental goals.  For me, the fundamental goal of politics ought to be the maximization of human freedom, not the maximization of universal participation in politics.<p>> In practice, I don&#x27;t consider any existing democracy to be sufficiently competent.<p>&quot;In practice&quot; means &quot;in reality&quot;.  When someone uses the word &quot;democracy&quot; in the context of topical political debate, they&#x27;re referring to what actually exists, not what might exist and be called by that name.  Like I said, I&#x27;m fine with discussing ideals, and exploring the full range of possibilites that we might aspire to, but let&#x27;s at least clear up semantic ambiguity by not using the same words that already refer to extant things to also refer to idealized hypotheticals.<p>> I&#x27;ve felt that, in this thread, we&#x27;ve reasonably made it clear when we&#x27;re talking about existing, present-day occurrences by citing &quot;in America&quot;, but perhaps not?<p>The thread began by criticizing people involved in present-day occurrences in America; it wasn&#x27;t, until now, clear where and when we were diverging from that context.",1375919603

It&#x27;s mostly that every instruction an modern CPU executes is predicted by a branch predictor, makes it&#x27;s way through several levels of cache, is run through a reorder buffer and register renaming and a reservation station before finally being executed.  And all of that takes energy, though it speeds up the rate at which sequential instructions can be issued by the processor quite a bit.<p>As to RISC vs CISC, well, it&#x27;s true that x86 instructions are decoded to micro Ops inside a modern processor but the fact that the instruction was complicated does have a cost even for a modern processor.  The act of just decoding four instructions in a clock cycle and transforming them into uOps is quite a bit of work, on the same order as finally executing them if they&#x27;re simple additions or such.  And the uOps that make up an instruction have to be completed all together or else when the processor is interrupted by a page fault or such it will resume in an inconsistent state. And the first time you run through a segment of code you can only run one instruction at a time since figuring out where instruction boundaries are is hard, though you can store the location of those boundaries with just another bit per byte when they&#x27;re in the L1 instruction cache.<p>On the other hand, complex variable length instructions mean that you don&#x27;t need as many bytes to express some piece of code both since you&#x27;re using less bytes per instruction on average and because complex instructions mean you sometimes use fewer of them.<p>Of course, Intel is the biggest CPU vendor out there and has correspondingly large and brilliant design teams working hand in hand with the most advanced fabs in the industry.<p>Now, there are many RISC instruction sets that have taken on x86 before, but they all attacked it from the high end, from upmarket.  Doing just the opposite of what ARM is doing now.  Will it succeed in dethroning x86 from the low end the way x86 did to it&#x27;s rivals?  Who knows.

The federal government will let you and your parents borrow as much as you need to pay for school, and you&#x27;ll make more money after you finish your degree, so your efforts are better spent trying to finish in as few semesters as possible to minimize the amount of money you need to borrow instead of trying to pay for things as you go.<p>This is an area, unfortunately, where kids from wealthier families have a huge advantage. Even if your parents aren&#x27;t willing to pay for college for you, they are much less likely to be hesitant to take PLUS loans on your behalf that they expect you to pay back. And as a general matter, people who came from wealthier backgrounds are much less afraid of debt and leverage.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s the most desirable state of affairs. My total cost of attendance in the early 2000&#x27;s at Georgia Tech (in-state) was only $10-12k (including housing and food, tuition was just a few thousand) which I could make during the summer.

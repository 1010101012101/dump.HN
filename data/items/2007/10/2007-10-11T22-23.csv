66567,comment,66344,66433,0,0,wschroter,,,"I've been hearing a lot of talk about entrepreneurs moving AWAY from Silicon Valley too due to the overwhelming competition for talent and sky-high cost of living.  Not to suggest SV is going away, but I wonder if you'll start seeing some activity in ""tier two"" cities that have solid infrastructure.  I'm thinking Raliegh/RTP for example.  Even Google is exporting some of it's operations to make finding talent easier.  Again, not refuting the importance of SV, but wondering if there is an opportunity to build elsewhere with similar resources being exported.",1192142270

People just aren't ready for new ideas - they'll spend hours telling you why you're an idiot when they don't understand what you're trying to do in the first place. I try not to even mention my startup while I'm there - I've even had people say they had religious objections to what I was doing. It's just nuts.<p>It's hard to understand the quality of the Bay Area startup environment until you actually live here for awhile - before I moved to SF I had this nebulous idea that it was where I should be, but in hindsight the difference is much more pronounced than that. <p>Here, you're almost in the minority if you don't have big, 'crazy' ideas.",1192141537

Will lots of startups that are started and built in Atlanta and Munich and London and Austin nonetheless be successful? Hell yes - but they should demo to investors in Silicon Valley.

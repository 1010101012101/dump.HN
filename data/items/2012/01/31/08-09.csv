Instead, I recommend creating projects of your own, if it's not in IT, it might be in the community, the student body or some other organization. Try to improve or create something on your own. As a CS student it's likely you'll find a job after college and you'll quickly learn all the things mentioned in the article and comments (including discovering what you don't like).<p>During your college breaks you're free to be completely self-directed.

It comes over as rather elitist.<p>Your posts remind me of typical Linux-on-the-desktop-defending posts that claim Linux's usability is just fine.

Intuitively, something is a proof of a proposition if it convinces someone else that the proposition is true, <i>and</i> the proposition actually is true.<p>Obviously, for difficult concepts, it's possible that every expert in the world could be convinced that a proposed proof is correct, only to later find out that it's not. The way I see it, you're <i>always</i> only proving that something has a high probability of being correct, and showing how high the probability is. For computer software, you might be showing that your program is correct with the same probability that the underlying hardware is working as specified (so cosmic rays shifting bits or faulty hardware are possible exceptions baked into your proof).<p>To get a bit silly, a mathematical proof delivered from person A to person B is really only showing that a proposition is true with the same probability that person B is sane, educated, and is understanding the concepts correctly,",1328000225

Only an exhaustive search would somehow be able to discover this.<p>With e.g. templates in C++, this is possible in some cases. You can test a template version using the limited range of an unsigned char, while your real implementation will use a uint64.<p>But instead of implementing e.g. a binary search, I prefer to take a proven implementation from e.g. the STL and adapt it for my needs.

At its core that was because of a set of dysfunctional beliefs I had about myself, and had little to do with introversion or extroversion. This is essentially why I'm suspicious of these labels because my experience of these traits time and again comes down to my beliefs, not some inborn characteristic I can't change.

There are four problems with Scroogle, not necessarily easy to solve:<p>(1) No Google Maps. Honestly I'll probably keep using Google Maps whatever else happens. I could give up Gmail and I'd still keep Google Maps.\n(2) No Google Calculator. This would be more important if Google hadn't changed their calculator app over the past couple of years, making it much more difficult/useless for unit conversions. Still, it would be nice if I could get Google Calculator results through Scroogle, and it shouldn't be <i>that</i> hard.\n(3) No image searches. This is one big reason to use Blekko right now; it is not Google Images and it has a nice image search which can be activated from the search line.\n(4) Scroogle keeps going down. This is Google's fault; Google should have whitelisted Scroogle as not-a-bot and supported their endeavor. Over the past months the problem has been that Google thinks Scroogle is a bot; but every couple of months there's also a time-frame where Google changes the antiquated search pages which Scroogle queries to make its searches.<p>For all that, I still like Scroogle and will probably continue to use it for the next couple of months. But Blekko is where I go when I want to do an image search.",1327999852

3532410,comment,3527810,3528969,2,0,lusr,,,"I felt, and feel, drained in social interactions where my social anxiety becomes an issue.  Where it's not an issue, social interactions are great and non-draining.  For instance, I'm really looking forward to spending this weekend at a music festival where I'll be floating around with a thousand other people on a river watching some bands play and I know I'm going to have a great time meeting tons of random people.<p>I also know that nearly every single extrovert attending that festival is going to be just as drained as I am on Sunday morning - empirical proof is the fact that pretty much everybody leaves these things at the same time (even though the gates usually close much later, and the bands are still playing).  In fact, I don't know ANY extroverts who don't eventually need time to themselves, either, so I find your definition to also be lacking.<p>These observations lead me to again question what ""introversion"" and ""extroversion"" really is.  It seems very difficult to know what's really going on:<p>EITHER<p>1.  ""introverts"" are really just e.g. socially anxious people who subconsciously use ""introversion"" as an excuse to avoid social situations where their anxiety causes them to feel drained and exhausted;  they aren't aware that it's social anxiety causing these issues.  It took me YEARS of CONSCIOUS effort to reduce my social anxiety, nevermind the years it took to recognize what it was.  I have to wonder how many people have HONESTLY made a similar effort before resorting to claiming they are ""introverted"" and that's just how they are.<p>OR<p>2.  people like myself are really just ""extroverts"" at heart with a love & approval addiction, and therefore place high value on social situations, which they find draining to the extent they lack self-confidence because that lack of self-confidence reduces the perceived love & approval they receive in those social situations;  this would explain why extroverts fear public speaking so much - their outward focus makes them more susceptible to fears of social rejection<p>How does one begin to test which of these theories is correct?  If you think they're both realistic, I really don't see much of an in-born difference between ""introverts"" and ""extroverts"".  As far as I can tell they might just be very narrow labels describing the symptoms (social anxiety, low self-esteem, etc.) of a set of dysfunctional beliefs.",1327999406

I agree that now prices are going up, but that is especially the case when you get a subsidized phone with your plan: there they'll charge you a steep premium. It's very sad but the introduction of smartphone whose price was above 400 (iPhone, I'm looking at you, not the first but the most popular) allowed the providers to pumps the price saying: ""Hey, here this 500 phone, but let's sign a 1500 two years contract"". People began stupidly falling for these sort of things, and the result is that prices are soaring and people are outraged. In the meantime providers are happy.\n/OT",1327998438

It's simpler than many editors (e.g., no explicit table support yet), but many people prefer it perhaps because of that simplicity.

329537,story,,,13,19,jgalvez,"Ask HN: On scalability and memory footprint",,"One of my co-workers is constantly arguing with me that we should not worry about memory footprint. For instance, let Rails use as much memory as it wants, the reasoning being that it would be pointless to try and cut down memory usage since we can just expand to as many slices with as much memory as we need on EC2.<p>Now, is there a significant speed increase in trying to keep memory usage low? What would be the educated answer for this? I could surely try to argue that yes using my programming knowledge and practice only, but I think a truly informed answer would require a deeper understanding of things.",1223703551

They are missing one critical slide - one that tells entrepreneurs to look at their cap table and terms and if they don't make sense at a small exit, get recapitalized or go home (take off the suit, put on some jeans and apply for the next YC session)",1223703004

2882071,comment,2877563,2881965,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"You are starting with an axiom that I'm talking nonsense and then bending everything I write in that direction instead of reading what I write.  E.g.,<p>""I regret to say that that's not as easy as it sounds.  There are issues of tractability, and more importantly, there's this not-quite-cottage industry of software development, which needs good-enough languages to use _today_.""<p>I didn't say it was ""easy"", and clearly my point is progress and not current software development.  Sure, for my project, I'm typing in code in Visual Basic .NET.  For writing code today, all things considered for my context, that is about the best option.<p>But what I'm typing in is hardly different from what anyone might have typed in all the way back to Algol.<p>Here's the point:  People type in all that code, and then what?  Can some software go over it, report properties, do some transformations with known, useful properties?  Not very much.  Such things won't be better for Visual Basic than they were for Algol or anything between.<p>So, they type in the code, and then all they have is just that code.  They can desk check it, test it, try it, revise it, etc., but it's all still digging the Panama Canal with a teaspoon one canal at a time.  That is, there's no real automation and no significant exploitation of mathematical properties that could lead to automation.<p>Or, return to most of the rest of engineering where we have specifications of resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors, fans, copper wire, steel sheets, aluminum bars, etc. with ohms, farads, density, tensile strength, electrical conductivity, etc.  Okay, now compare with some DLL or its source code:  What engineering properties do we have.  Essentially none.  It's like building with iron before we knew about tensile strength.<p>Sure, with some such research progress, eventually programmers would benefit.  Obviously the intention is real progress in software productivity.  We're not going to get such productivity by more of the same that got us C, C++, Java, Python, Visual Basic .NET, C#, etc.<p>Also for another of your points, I'm not talking about anything like branch prediction or deep pipelining.  That's basically what to do with with the hardware to execute an existing instruction set.<p>Also the point is not math or not.  The point is progress.  Math will be necessary but not sufficient.  That is, just stuffing in some math won't yield more than the old trick of putting two extra, unused transistors in a radio to claim nine transistors instead of seven.<p>Your point that there's a lot of good CS to do without 'mathematizing' the field is not promising for research or significant progress.",1313271482

Multiple levers are considered in the motivating applications in statistics. When pulled, each lever provides a reward drawn from a distribution associated with that specific lever. The objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls.<p>In practice, multi-armed bandits have been used to model the problem of managing research projects in a large organization, like a science foundation or a pharmaceutical company. Given its fixed budget, the problem is to allocate resources among the competing projects, whose properties are only partially known now but may be better understood as time passes.<p>In the early versions of the multi-armed bandit problem, the gambler has no initial knowledge about the levers.

If you're using software, then I recommend using something like Heartbeat to share an IP address between the two. It basically does the same thing that mahadri suggested, but it's automatic. Here's how it works.<p>Let's say you have two servers, primary and secondary -- primary is the one that's currently acting as your load balancer. When both servers are running Heartbeat, they exchange UDP pings every second. If the primary server stops responding, then the Heartbeat process on the backup server will automatically take over the shared IP. When the primary box returns, it won't cause any problems or steal back the IP address, until you explicitly instruct it to do so. (If you really wanted it to steal back the IP automatically, I'm sure you could configure it that way.) You can also initiate a failover with a single command, which is useful when you need to do maintenance on the primary box. Running ""/usr/share/heartbeat/hb_takeover all"" is a lot simpler than having to manually reassign the IP address.<p>My company's infrastructure is very dependent on heartbeat -- we use it to support our load balancers and all our back-end services. You need to be careful or it will do ""surprising"" things when you're rebooting or changing the network config, but on the whole it makes it cheaper and easier to provide highly-available services.<p>Of course, if you're using a hardware load balancer, it should have a similar failover protocol built-in. I'd recommend just using its built-in features, that's what you're paying the big bucks for.",1313270246
2882029,comment,2881455,2881691,9,0,psykotic,,,"If you don't think ahead, it's easy to expose an API with implicit implications of poor or at least limited performance. The rest of your code base becomes dependent on it, and the month before shipping when you start really focusing on optimizing you realize it's too late to do much of anything to fix it. Sometimes it can be fixed but only by adding a ton of behind-the-scenes code complexity to that API to try to speculatively optimize for anticipated usage patterns.<p>A simple, innocent-looking example is a string data type that offers (and implicitly encourages) use of random access. If you're using a fixed byte-width for characters that's unproblematic, but it's an issue if you later replace it with a variable width representation like UTF-8. If all your string processing client code is written to rely on random access rather than incremental iterators, you have a problem. You could choose to store an index array alongside the character array. That would roughly double your string storage requirements, but at least you could still offer O(1) random access.<p>Or you could add code complexity by having each string remember the last index it looked up (sometimes called a finger), and if the next requested index is near by, it uses simple O(distance) forward or backward movement to return the nearby character's value. That seems like a good compromise. But what about multithreading? It looks like we need this cached index to be thread local. Not too bad. But what if we're interleaving accesses to the same string within a single thread? Now the different accesses are fighting over the same cached index. It looks like we need a multiple-entry cache to support this usage pattern.<p>If you're a good engineer you can probably find the right compromise along the above lines that works for your code base. But it would have been much better if your API design hadn't constrained your future opportunities for changing internal representations and optimizing performance.<p>Here's another example: OpenGL's immediate mode graphics interface where you can specify vertex data piecemeal. Because everything written in that style is code driven rather than data driven, the driver can't just allocate a single dynamic vertex buffer with a fixed vertex format and push attributes onto it in response to glColor(), glVertex(), etc. What you can do (and what the good OpenGL drivers do) is to speculatively keep around a bunch of staging buffers with different vertex formats behind the scenes that are first created dynamically in response to recurring vertex and primitive patterns. You can see how it goes: It's a lot like the implicit caching in the string random access example, and it has all the same problems, and a whole lot of new ones.<p>These kinds of late-in-the-day performance fixes for early API design decisions (even though the early API is perfectly clean and modular, in fact maybe too modular) are doable but they are costly in complexity and programmer time. They are also fragile. In my two examples, if you're in the sweet spot of the behind-the-scenes caching system, you'll be seeing good performance. But change one small thing that from your point of view shouldn't impact performance, and you might suddenly fall off a performance cliff because the cache is now too small, or whatever. Incidentally, this problem of fragile automatic optimization isn't restricted to library design. It's also a very serious issue with compilers. Modern compilers rely way too much on a fragile form of ""crystal ball optimization"", as one of my coworkers likes to call it. It makes it very difficult to write code with predictable high performance and even harder to maintain.<p>Damn, that was a lot of text.",1313270244

I assume we'd have to collect over thousand of emails over time. Obviously it's hard to manage this amount of contacts. Sure, I'll be able to read all the replies, but what I'd like to be able to do is to store the relevant info along with them: names, locations, occupation, number of days it took them to reply, some notes about their replies (""not very interested"" or ""annoyed"" or ""excited""), then effectively retrieve and use the contacts again if they qualify and send back some prepared ""thank you"" emails or other slightly customized replies. Well, you get the picture. Spreadsheet does not really solve the automation problem here.<p>Any software for these purposes?",1273381138

Early stage startups don't need to know anything about finance, business law, and management.  All they need to know about IP I can tell them in 5 minutes.  As for marketing, it depends what the schools teach, but startup marketing is so unusual and varies so much depending on the product that I would be very surprised if a B school class had anything useful to say about it.",1273380948

That's a lot of effort, but its a thought. So someone from Python can see some typical python sample, and how to do it in your language. Same for other languages.<p>Typically, we wish to see how to do something in a new language that we used to do in the earlier one. Going from Java to Ruby, I was always looking for this till I actually came across a blog post meant for Java programmers moving to Ruby. (For example, how to do the main() in Ruby).",1273380437

I appreciate being able to write a complete sentence, and feel sorry for those who can't communicate in written format.<p>So, if that makes me a slave to the system, so be it.   What the author fails to appreciate, is that perhaps some of us will have a happier life being lead through a system, not everyone is going to be an entrepreneurial learner.  We certainly do lose some freedom, and to some degree propagate a system of enslavement - but it serves some of us fairly well.<p>I realize the author is writing on a higher plane, but it's also interesting how some of his thoughts compare to PG's: ""It would be well if we stopped lying to ourselves about what compulsory schooling does for our children. It temporarily imprisons them; it standardizes them; it intimidates them. If that's what we want, we should admit it.""<p>I thought it was a good read, but maybe that's because I'm listening to Eminem's ""I'm not Afraid"" on repeat. :-)",1273378248

If you&#x27;re using goto, it&#x27;s because your higher-level control flow constructs - if/for/while, exceptions - are inadequate. Likewise if you&#x27;re using macros, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s usually because your within-language constructs are inadequate; things like LINQ (which I&#x27;ve seen people use macros to emulate in other languages) are important and common enough that there should be a standard way of doing them in the language.",1417708733

But the only good one, lol :]<p>For the rest: I think I know what you mean. I used to be self-analytical like that as well. Getting older though I found in the end it just made me unhappy because all this analysis (for me) led to mainly focussing on the bad points and ignoring all the good points. So now I&#x27;m easier on myself and instead of constantly trying to fix my whole self in one go I&#x27;m trying to do it rather gradually: firstly always try to do good and good only and secondly when I figure I&#x27;m not doing good (well, just admitting that and trying to fix it is already a good start and steps beyond what some ever achieve), or being way too biased, or wanting to kick people becasue they are being complete asholes, etc, etc, a short reflection going for example like &#x27;ok, I&#x27;m too biased here, that&#x27;s not so good, but it&#x27;s also nothing to be ashamed of, just try better next time&#x27; or &#x27;ok, the guys opinion clearly differs from yours and is possibly also completely wrong, but that does not mean he&#x27;s a complete asshole. Better try to educate him instead of trying to kick his ass&#x27;. No idea if that makes sense to anyone but after some years of doing this I think I&#x27;ve actually become a better person. And definitely less unhappy. Nonetheless, sometimes I&#x27;ll still be a complete ass myself mainly in online discussions. Working on it though :]",1417708693

terrific for intuition and techniques
in 3D)<p>College<p>Analytic geometry (conic sections)<p>Calculus I and II<p>Linear algebra<p>Linear algebra II, Halmos, <i>Finite Dimensional
Vector Spaces</i> (baby version of Hilbert space
theory)<p>Advanced calculus, e.g., baby Rudin, <i>Principles
of Mathematical Analysis</i> -- nice treatment
of Fourier series, good for signals in electronic
engineering.  The first chapters are 
about continuity, uniform continuity, and
compactness which are the main tools used
to prove the sufficient conditions for the
Riemann integral to exist.  At the end Rudin
shows that the Riemann integral exists 
if and only if the function is continuous
everywhere but on a set of measure zero.
But what Rudin does there at the beginning
with metric spaces is more general than
he needs for the Riemann integral but is
important later in more general treatments
in <i>analysis</i>.  Rudin does sequences and
series because they are standard ways to
define and work with some of the important
special functions, especially the exponential
and sine and cosine further on in the book.
The material in the back on exterior algebra is for people
interested in differential geometry, especially
for relativity theory.<p>Ordinary differential equations, e.g.,
Coddington, a beautifully written book,
Coddington and Levinson is
much more advanced) -- now can do basic
AC circuit theory like eating ice cream.<p>Advanced calculus from one or several more traditional
books, e.g., the old MIT favorite Hildebrand,
<i>Advanced Calculus for Applications</i>,
Fleming, <i>Functions of Several Variables</i>,
Buck, <i>Advanced Calculus</i> -- can now look
at Maxwell&#x27;s equations and understand at least
the math.  And can work with the gradient
for steepest descent in the maximum likelihood
approach to <i>machine learning</i>.<p>Maybe take a detour into differential geometry
so that can see why Rudin, Fleming, etc. do
exterior algebra, and why Halmos does multi-linear
algebra, and then will have a start
on general relativity.<p>Royden, <i>Real Analysis</i>.  So will
learn measure theory, crucial for
good work in probability and stochastic
processes, and get a start on functional
analysis (vector spaces where each point
is a function -- good way to see how to use
some functions to approximate others).
Also will learn about linear operators
and, thus, get a solid foundation for
linear systems in signal processing and
more.<p>Rudin, <i>Real and Complex Analysis</i>,
at least the first, real, half.
Here will get a good start on
the Fourier transform.<p>Breiman, <i>Probability</i> -- beautifully
written, even fun to read.  Measure
theory based probability.  If that 
is too big a step up in probability,
then take a fast pass through some
elementary treatment of <i>probability
and statistics</i> and then get back to
Breiman for the real stuff.  Will
finally see what the heck a random
variable really is and cover the important
cases of convergence and the important
classic limit theorems.  Will understand
conditioning, the Radon-Nikodym theorem
(von Neumann&#x27;s proof is in Rudin, <i>R&CA</i>),
conditioning, the Markov assumption,
and martingales and the astounding
martingale convergence theorem and 
the martingale inequality, the strongest
in mathematics.  So will see that
with random variables, can look for
independence, Markov dependence, and
covariance dependence, and these
forms of dependence, common in
practice, can lead to approximation,
estimation, etc.<p>Now will be able to understand EE
treatments of second order stationary
stochastic processes, digital filtering,
power spectral estimation, etc.<p>Stochastic processes, e.g., 
Karatzas and Shreve. <i>Brownian Motion
and Stochastic Calculus</i>.  Now can
get started on mathematical finance.<p>But there are many side trips available
in numerical methods, linear programming,
Lagrange multipliers (a surprisingly 
general technique), integer programming
(a way to see the importance of
P versus NP), mathematical statistics,
partial differential equations, 
mathematical finance, etc.<p>For some ice cream, Luenberger, <i>Optimization

Because this is a paid Google advert.<p>> But this spring, Google introduced a product called Sustained Use Discounts, and this made things much simpler.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the sustained use model makes it harder to calculate your ultimate bill, not easier. It has the same issues Amazon&#x27;s now retired Light and Medium usage tiers had, how do you track if you&#x27;re at 25%, 50%, 75%, etc utilisation? Keeping track of that is annoying and harder than you&#x27;d think in a real production environment with dynamic instances responding to load.<p>Amazon&#x27;s new pricing model actually just scrapped something akin to sustained use billing because it was unpopular. You wouldn&#x27;t know that reading the article.<p>> Maybe they didn’t want to draw attention to what’s obviously a reaction to Google<p>Maybe it was a reaction to customer feedback? I see no evidence that Google caused this change, and the fact that Amazon moved AWAY from Google&#x27;s model is very telling. Light and medium utilisation RI are effectively Google&#x27;s model, they just do it dynamically. Amazon hasn&#x27;t added that or indicated that they will.<p>Do these people even understand Amazon&#x27;s RI pricing structure, or Google&#x27;s sustained usage, or anything at all?<p>> Byrne says that until Amazon changed its pricing, his company was toying with the idea of switching to Google, a move that would have saved Copper.io hundreds of thousands of dollars—until Monday, at least.<p>That literally makes zero sense. Heavy utilisation RIs have been available since forever, and are extremely price competitive with every other major competitor in the cloud infrastructure space (namely Google, and Azure).<p>If it would have saved you &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; legitimately then you are mismanaging your account heavily.<p>> “When I saw the Amazon announcement, I said: ‘Great. We don’t have to consider moving.&#x27;”<p>Because, why? I don&#x27;t understand what it is they think Amazon changed. Because that statement makes no sense. If you were mismanaging your account before, you&#x27;d still be mismanaging it now. Amazon moving payments will save you a little money (due to the interest on that money sitting in your accounts) but nothing like what is described here.<p>> When Google first got into the cloud business back in 2008, the company bet that people would want to run cloud applications on its infrastructure in highly specialized ways and not mess around with operating systems and virtual machines. That proved to be a bad bet.<p>That is an under-statement. Google thought that people wanted to be locked into their cloud APIs and initially at least have to completely re-write all of their software for Google&#x27;s app engine. It was supremely arrogant on Google&#x27;s part.<p>App engine now supports more standardised APIs and databases, but it remains more expensive to do than it should be. Azure&#x27;s &quot;web-sites&quot; product is what Google App Engine should have been when it first got released, and even today I find &quot;web-sites&quot; more compelling as a bottled solution than Google App Engine (although VMs trump both).<p>> And now the company is fast catching up.<p>Is that a fact? Because both Google and Azure topped $1B in 2013, and from what I&#x27;ve been seeing Azure, not Google, has been growing to compete with Amazon in 2014. Microsoft has been leveraging many pre-existing channels (education, MSDN, et al) to give out Azure trials and it seems to be working for them.<p>> Byrne says that while Google doesn’t offer the wide range of products, it beats out Amazon in many respects. Google’s compute speed and network “is faster than Amazon’s,” he says. “They’re probably the only people where you can say that their infrastructure is really world-leading.”<p>If you weren&#x27;t certain this was a paid product advert, now you should be.<p>Compute speed is relative to cost, and dollar per dollar that statement seems untrue. Network speed on Amazon and Google is great, Google might be better but I wouldn&#x27;t migrate to them because neither Amazon or Azure have let me down in that department.",1417707599

We would like to start testing more, but we&#x27;re running into a quandary as how to start.  Much of our code is not written in a way that lends itself to unit testing so to be able to start testing, we have to refactor, which might break everything.<p>One approach that&#x27;s come up is called &quot;differential unit testing&quot; where I don&#x27;t need to go in a write the tests - but I measure the inputs and outputs of different functions and I monitor if they changed after my code changes (at least that&#x27;s how I understand it.)  There&#x27;s a paper about it at http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~taoxie/publications/ast07-diffut.pdf.  I first encountered a version of the idea at http://zachholman.com/talk/move-fast-break-nothing/ (their case they are running both in parallel so it&#x27;s easier to check each case - but the concept would be the same if I had common input cases and output cases.)<p>Now it&#x27;s question how I implement such an approach. One way might be put in certain waypoints in my code where I can run a stack trace and save it - then use those inputs to different functions as my test cases.  I save a &quot;baseline&quot; and then as I change my code, I run the tests, looking for changes.<p>I can see several issues with the approach.  It might test too many versions - I don&#x27;t know which are important changes to test and which are insignificant (without manual intervention.)  I might actually have a broken implementation to start  - and I&#x27;m comparing agains that. maybe others..<p>I&#x27;m not try to suggest this approach would replace more traditional unit testing - but as a form of &quot;canary&quot; to detect when something is not how it use to be at a more granular and earlier level than doing full integration testing.<p>I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has tried this approach and what your opinions are?",1417707407

If you&#x27;re a data scientist and you say you want to use Clojure or Haskell (a high-level concern) or that you want to do GPU programming or dive deep on assembly (low-level work) you can. Machine learning, 10 years ago, was extremely appealing because software managers were figuring out that they needed it, but most admitted they knew little about it, so they gave a lot of autonomy to individual contributors. (That may change, and &quot;data science&quot; may become thoroughly commoditized.)<p>It&#x27;s the Fundamental Theorem of Employment: you&#x27;re usually hired either to do (a) something your boss can&#x27;t do for himself or (b) something he doesn&#x27;t want to do. With (a) you get respect and autonomy and high pay; with (b) you get treated like a commodity. &quot;Data scientist&quot; (or software &quot;architect&quot; vs. &quot;engineer&quot;) is, often, a programmer who&#x27;s managed to learn enough of &quot;the hard stuff&quot; to move himself over to (a). It&#x27;s the (b) category of engineers who get stuck on &quot;Scrum teams&quot;.<p>I feel like some of the crowding of &quot;data science&quot; (and, as you noted, not all of the &quot;data scientists&quot; know what they&#x27;re talking about) comes from the way that &quot;Agile&quot;-style micromanagement has made the rest of programming so braindead. There are people like me who enjoy the hard mathematical aspect, but others who&#x27;ve just learned that if they call themselves &quot;data scientists&quot; they get more interesting projects and don&#x27;t have to munch on Scrum tickets. For them, the math is an impediment rather than a challenge and an attraction.<p><i>I mentioned the deep dive into the machine learning techniques as unfortunately most of the programmers I meet who call themselves data scientists, just aren&#x27;t very good at stats.</i><p>There&#x27;s a depth vs. breadth problem, because machine learning is a much, much bigger field than many people think. I&#x27;ve gone pretty deep on penalized regressions (e.g. ridge and Lasso with large numbers of features) but know only the basics about tree-based models. I can read the papers on neural network architectures (e.g. convolutional nets) and implement them, and I understand the theory that led to them, but I still lack some of the intuition (like <i>why</i> rectified linear units are more useful in image processing than regular logistics).<p>I feel like there are some people who pick up a lot of vocabulary and interview well (but not with you, because you actually know the field) but are really just playing around with parameters. I like the math, but &quot;data science&quot; is mostly bullshit and I hope the term will die; I want to see more machine learning and less business pomposity.",1417707157

The metric if there is one is how engaged your community is. Do they open your regular cadence newsletter? Do your current readers forward your newsletters? You can game social media all you want and in the end the real thing is are you providing value to people in the community you are contributing to/part of. All those people who sell 2,000 books with a single email spent hundreds of hours growing their email list one by one. It is easy to write one blog post that goes viral.

In cases when the risk analysis engine can&#x27;t confidently predict whether a user is a human or an abusive agent, it will prompt a CAPTCHA to elicit more cues, increasing the number of security checkpoints to confirm the user is valid.]<p>So my guess would be they analyze users behaviour on the page where captcha is located, things like mouse movements, time it takes to type out the words, spelling mistakes corrected and whatever else humans do differently than bots - and only then combine that with your historical cookies. Maybe it is much more complicated than that, I, as well as you, don&#x27;t know the details.<p>Do you really think that they would go ahead and implement a such system without rigorous testing of effectiveness?

3019313,comment,3018797,3018797,1,0,Tloewald,,,"This whole ""not confusing people"" thing seems like a nifty idea, but I think we're talking about a different company.<p>Is there any reason to believe that Microsoft doesn't want to confuse consumers or that not confusing consumers is in any way a winning strategy for them? Yes, I'm being sarcastic, but it seems to me that not confusing customers is Apple's schtick. Microsoft does very well with a different business model that historically has included:<p>WinCE WinMobile PocketPC etc. even Windows Phone 7 has gone through several name variations.<p>Windows Vista and 7 both offered a bewildering range of SKUs.<p>Version naming and numbering schemes that make no sense to anybody. (Although Final Cut Pro X is an admirable attempt by Apple to compete here, Pro having been Apple's traditional replacement for 3.)<p>And don't forget that Microsoft's hardware partners are all past masters of incomprehensible product lines.<p>And can anyone figure out which Intel CPU is which without using google today?",1316548754

This rules out Akka >1.0, and 1.0 is pretty old and sometimes just broken.  I just spent a couple weeks rewriting a ton of code to get myself out of this hole after starting with the awesome scala-bootstrap, and I can tell you it's no fun.  So, if you want to be able to use Akka, or at least keep up with other developments in the Scala world, avoid the temptation of pretty Finagle and com.twitter.util!<p>Also, the sbt they use in the tutorial is an old version; the community is going through a big shift to sbt 0.10 now, which is a totally different system.

Thankfully, management responded and the guys got some more swamp coolers, as well as these things you soak in cool water and put around your neck, which improved things.<p>So yes, especially this year with all those heat warnings, miserably hot 100+ degree work floors, mandatory overtime and constant use of temps, harsh conditions are, unfortunately, quite normal for that kind of environment.<p>That said, just because it's normal, that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be improved.

There's downsides to this though, and that's where it was a tradeoff for me.<p>For me, Titanium didn't offer enough control for what was being offered. Once I was invested using their platform for developing a mobile app, I would have been locked in. If there was something I needed to do on my app that wasn't supported by their API, I was basically SOL (shit out of luck).<p>Phonegap, on the other hand, is largely html/css/js running in a WebView with an ObjC wrapper that provides access to hardware functionality. If you write your app entirely within the framework, you're limited by the performance of UIWebView. This can seriously be an issue for certain kinds of apps.<p>On the other hand, Phonegap worked great as a way for me to build the UI using the web technologies I know best. Since its just a framework, I have full access to all of the project files and source code, so I can add or change stuff if I need to. An app I released back in April needed to play video. There was no capability for this native to Phonegap, so I had to add the code myself. ObjC was new to me, but I was able to work through it.<p>Phonegap is setup to let you build to other platforms too, but you have to set up the dev environments for Android, etc, separately.<p>Ultimately what it comes down to is what you need, and what you are looking to do.

Normal people use whatever their computers come with and almost nobody buys boxed Windows. Vista was an exception - it was so bad people preferred using XP, even if installing it took a whole day of boots and downloads. When OEMs start to integrate 8 into their boxes you'll see 8's adoption match OEM shipments very closely.

It also placed a constant load on the people involved, since you're essentially always re-hiring the same position, over and over, with the requisite interviews and costs.

Also, certain headcount metrics may exclude contractors, which might be a way for management to look like they're keeping headcount down while still getting the hands they actually need.

What drives the decision is outstanding uncertainty conditional on the data observed (not conditional on the null hypothesis of zero effect and some non-sequential iid sampling process), the discount rate (which is totally absent in this article), and the reward structure (which is not a Type I and Type II error).<p>The absurdity of the frequentist approach is clear from the admonition not to look at the results of the tests too often.",1316546698

3019088,comment,3017358,3018508,8,0,potatolicious,,,"Not true - I'm a Canadian expat working in the US and I've had to deal with this myself. It really comes down to this:<p>- Canadian residents always pay tax to Canada on all income, no matter where it is made.<p>- Canadian non-residents do not pay tax on international income.<p>- Residency is determined by:<p>A) How much time you have spent outside of the country. If you have spent the majority of the year (6 months + 1 day) outside the country, you can claim non-residency. If you have spent the majority of the year in Canada, fat chance.<p>B) ""Significant ties"" to Canada. This seems draconian, but is actually not really. You can have a driver's license, space in a storage unit, or bank accounts and still easily make the claim of non-residency. Hell, I have a friend who owns a rental property in Toronto and still makes it.<p>- In any case, the whole process is much easier and less burdensome than the American equivalent. The first year you believe you qualify as a non-resident, you file a form with the CRA (Canadian equivalent of IRS) with your blank tax return (stating all income is international). Once you do that, you no longer have to do it ever again. I do not have to get my non-residency status constantly recertified.<p>It's all pretty simple. At the end of the day, if you live in Canada you pay tax on money you make - anywhere - and if you live outside of it you're basically just off the hook.",1316545290

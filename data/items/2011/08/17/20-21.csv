Like others are saying, they tell me jack crap about the device, and the Russell Brand commercials that actually do? They might not be my tea, but at least they have some personality (comedic value debated). Haven't seen them on TV. Brilliant strategy there, HP!<p>- Apple's commercials are so well-received that rolling a commercial out based on a <i>feature</i> (see: Facetime) can generate sales because they know just who to market to and, by focusing on one device per form factor, have a history of trusted quality through said long-term focus on each of them.

2896925,comment,2896433,2896872,3,0,corin_,,,"I feel they should create a single business brand and market the shit out of it, make it a well known name.<p>If I say ""I have a thinkpad"", people know what I mean. If I say ""I have a latitude"" or ""a vostro"", most people don't. And if I say ""I have a Dell"", it's such a wide range that it doesn't really say much about what laptop I have.<p>The other reason for this is confusion. When anyone asks me what Dell laptop I would recomend, I never have a clue. What's the difference between a Vostro and a Lattitude? Fuck knows, until you've actually looked at the different models. I'm a geek, I happen to own a Dell laptop, and I've worked on Dell marketing campaigns. If I can't get my head around their many ranges...<p>Then they need something destinctive, memorable. Hey, you know thinkpads? Oh you know, the ones with the red nipple. Yeah, those ones. And by something distinctive, I mean something small, and something that doesn't detract from the overall design. I don't mean ""we can put a cool pattern on the lid"".<p>Then they need product placement. Good product placement. In the UK, the millionairs on ""Dragon's Den"" and Alan Sugar on ""The Apprentice"" (two big TV shows) should use stylish dell laptops. Same in the US. I've been a Blackberry fan for years, and I'm familiar enough with most marketing ideas not to get sucked in by them, but I'll be honest, a small part of me loves the fact that Obama has the same phone as me. I hate myself for caring, but the fact of the matter is that people do care.<p>And the logic behind product placement works at lower levels too. People used to see a boss with a thinkpad and aspire to have it as a status symbol. (Just like used to be the case for blackberries, before they stopped being ""just a phone for businessment"".) That's what they need to bring back. It needs to become a status symbol in offices around the world.<p>I don't know how much the above ideas would help. I'm not sure what other things they should do. The one thing I'm completely sure of is that what they have been doing hasn't been working as well as it could have.",1313614507

The population has been disarmed bit by bit, first various gun rights were taken away until ultimately all gun rights were taken away in a hysterical response to the Dunblane massacre. Then every weapon was targeted, knives, batons, everything. Even self-defense rights were taken away, if you use your own fists in your own home to defend yourself against an attacker you could potentially go to jail. Meanwhile, British police powers have been growing out of control, with little to keep them in check. While the world made much note of the PATRIOT act in the US few people, even in the UK, paid much attention to the far more sweeping expansion of British police powers undertaken as ""anti-terrorism"" measures.

For example, an algorithm for real time graphics processing would be just as impractical to run on ENIAC as it would be to do with pencil and paper, but there's no reason you couldn't port the software.  So if the validity of the patent is based on its usefulness in a real-time application, it would have to be something like ""running algorithm x using computer system y to achieve the desired result in z length of time.""

This also makes it very difficult for a company like Dell to differentiate itself from their competitors, and be more than simply an interchangeable part of a commodity computing ecosystem, one in which they no longer have any kind of efficient manufacturing and distribution chain advantage. A further disadvantage is that Dell has traditionally had a lack of relations with retailers and distributors, which worked fine when you were selling a familiar product with incrementally faster specs, but not so much when you need to educate your customers about a new type of product.<p>Ultimately, Dell's true success (represented by a large growth in stock value) would seem to depend on getting back ahead of the curve to drive large growth in demand, for example with advanced form factors such as head-mounted display technology and wearable computing/NFC. They'll have to do something to bide their time until they can deliver a complete novel mass-market solution of some kind, which will have to be very polished and obviously valuable to consumers if they are to have any kind of lasting advantage over their competitors. This would require the acquisition of some serious software and UX design chops, along with a rethinking of their distribution to feature 3rd party retailers, and a shift to marketing something truly novel.<p>On second thought, that other alternative you mentioned is starting to look pretty good.",1313613780

That's not to say the guy should be excused, but just pointing out that it doesn't necessarily means he lacks people skills, it may just have been the straw that broke the camel's back.<p>As far as engineers talking to customers goes, I think that depends heavily on the company.  Obviously engineers can provide better customer support than someone with little technical knowledge, but if there are many customers then there's most likely more bang for the buck solving technical problems that affect many people.

It's pretty well decided now (although not without any controversy) that, at the margin, minimum wage laws increase unemployment in the lowest-paid workers.<p>The fact that some deregulation may have (localized) negative consequences shouldn't automatically disqualify them: there are more choices than just ""let the market run free"" vs ""continue the regulation"". We can, for example, get the benefits of that free trade, and use a portion of the economic gains to finance job retraining programs.<p>However, I'd also like to point out an implicit assumption in your question that may be problematic. You refer to ""the global objective function"". Part of our difficulty is that there isn't such a global function that all can agree on. Indeed, it may be that some of our utility functions are mutually exclusive.

2896753,comment,2896433,2896658,4,0,corin_,,,"<i>Possibly biased/influenced view since I do some marketing work for Dell, and in particular for their Alienware brand.</i><p>- I feel the biggest issues to address from the point of view of their products are:<p>- Either stop trying to branch out into novel ideas, or find a way to make them work. Failed attempts such as the Streak don't help them financially, or from a PR point of view. Edit: I guess an extension of this point is that their innovations are big enough that they can fail miserably, but not big enough to be that interesting. Take the Streak as an example, it was a big enough move from what consumers are used to that it flopped miserably, but at the end of the day it wasn't really a new idea, just a new execution - half tablet, half phone, which made it both shitty as a tablet (who wants a tiny screen) and annoying as a phone (hey, look at this huge slab I'm holding to my ear, I carry it in a purse because I don't have giant-sized pockets). If they are going to innovate, find something actually exciting.<p>- Not enough promotion, from personal experience I see less Dell adverts than I did 5 years ago<p>- Better customer support. Invest to become the best in the industry in this area, and customer loyalty / word of mouth praise will pay dividends<p>- Be exciting. The only time I'm aware of Dell products in news is for their new swing-and-a-miss lines, such as the Streak. Release a really expensive, really beautiful laptop once a year (think Sony Z series). Release an unbelievably cheap budget machine that makes headlines. These products don't even need to sell in huge numbers, they just need to get press. If you read an article about how great a company's 3,000 laptop is, there's a good chance you don't want to spend that much, but it makes you think ""if this is so awesome, and the press say it is, they probably have a cheaper product that has the same awesomeness-per-dollar-that-it-costs that would suit me"". And really, a lot of their products WILL be as good for their price, but they just aren't exciting for journalists to write about.<p>- Become the number one choice for business users. Fill the slot that was created when IBM sold thinkpad to Levano. Sure, thinkpads are still good, but it's not quite the same. I think there is a very real opportunity for one of the big players to launch a range of business laptops that can become the new thinkpad, the brand that office workers on low salaries use, all the way up to executives who have upgraded to a better spec machine. They used to get by on being the boring choice for businesses, but that doesn't work so well now that they have such big competition. Find a new way to become the defacto business choice. You don't have to be cool by offering sexy designs, or multiple colour options, in the business world you can be cool by letting people show that they mean business. Thinkpads were/are a sign of job status, which made their plain design loved for its own reasons.<p>Anyway, that's just a few thoughts of the top of my head. Should probably point out that the involvement I have had in marketing Dell products is purely about brand exposure/interest, and purely on a ""here's an advertising company that we can spend a bit of money with"" basis - nothing to do with company/product strategy or anything like that.",1313611487

The relevant time constants in the pilot->controls->control surfaces->attitude->pilot loop are measured in fractional seconds (and when they're not, e.g., in fly-by-wire designs, the loops aren't closed by a person).<p>The fastest relevant time constant for the control loop of a switching power converter with meager 1 kHz closed-loop bandwidth is measured in fractional milliseconds (you care about poles up to, say, 10x your crossover frequency). For a pretty run-of-the-mill analog circuit like an op-amp, the relevant time constants are often measured in nanoseconds. Heck, even something slow like an audio amplifier has relevant time constants in the tens of microsecond range.<p>Also, don't underestimate the amount of subconscious math you're doing even for a simple task like walking.

Slaves were once traded on the open market, after all, and they were probably efficiently priced, but that certainly doesn't make it a good thing. (Just to hit the point again, efficiency has very little to do with ""good"".)<p>I think it's possible to regulate effectively, but the problem is that it requires an engineer's approach, not a government's approach. One must be able to adapt, admit one is wrong, and generally regulate at the incentives, instead of being required to stay politically viable and only <i>then</i> regulate, be politically unable to admit error (and via the mechanisms of politics, become insulated from the facts that would show error), and be continuously stuck in the regulation of the effects instead of the incentives that got us there. Oh, and as I alluded to previously, being regulated by people who won't even look at the mechanics of the market squarely because they think they're intrinsically evil because sometimes they make bad things happen (which they definitely <i>do</i>!) isn't a great start to engineering success.<p>Yes. The market can be evil by human standards, just as gravity feels pretty evil when you're in a crashing plane.

2896740,comment,2896002,2896680,13,0,andyking,,,"This was a crown court case, which is even more concerning. Crown court is used for serious offences which require a punishment of more than six months in prison, so for a case such as this to get from arrest to multi-year crown court sentence in a week is hugely concerning. A case has to first be heard in magistrates' court and handed to crown court, so it will have been in the hands of Chester Crown Court for just a day or two.<p>But for more minor offences attracting sentences under six months, magistrates' courts have been sitting <i>through the night</i> to ""process"" literally thousands of small-time, mainly first offender criminals.<p>Courts have been under great political pressure to serve swift and tough ""justice"" such that minor offences have attracted fairly lengthy prison sentences. Take the case of the mother of two young children who slept through the Manchester riots, but whose flatmate gave her a pair of stolen shorts from a store the morning after. She got five months in prison, for an offence which (if it even got as far as court) would normally attract a period of unpaid community work and/or a fine.

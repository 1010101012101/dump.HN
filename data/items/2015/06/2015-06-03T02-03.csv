It is not clear that &quot;old people set in their ways&quot; is a result of minds that have simply been around a long time, regardless of their physical condition (i.e. immortal or not), as opposed to a consequence of a physically aging, deteriorating human brain.<p>So we might find ourselves with the equivalent of a population composed entirely of twenty or thirty-somethings, except some of them happen to have many decades (eventually centuries and millenniums) of experience.

Had it started in places like Korea, it could&#x27;ve been profitable but not to the point where it can finance other fantastic ideas and projects, starting a snowballing effect.<p>2) True too. A tech company from US? Everyone else around the world is bound to hear about it. A hot tech company from non-US? Most others hear about it when it&#x27;s acquired by US company. KakaoTalk makes millions and millions in real profit and has 93% market penetration of a fairly not-so small country but no one outside knows about it. And when Facebook buys WhatsApp for $16 billion in paper money, and everyone knows about WhatsApp.<p>3) Programming is possible only if you know english alphabets. Much tools/methodologies are first available in English. Big factor why large S Korean corporations have sucky software. If you can speak/write/read English well, far more prestigious careers paths are available for you in the mega corporations. Although this is fast changing due to effect of Facebook and other internet success stories.<p>4) Maybe. But not always. Cyworld in S Korea was a social network service that was launched about 4-5 years before Myspace and facebook. At one point it dominated S Korean cyber space. Then they got complacent and stagnated. And facebook came in.<p>Interesting anecdotal. I heard that Andy Rubin first floated Android OS to Samsung to launch. Samsung already had been one of the big phone makers at that point. Samsung for some reason turned down the offer. I think they knew (probably right) they couldn&#x27;t make Android succeed. They are hardware makers, weak in software overall, and not part of the English speaking sphere.

I don&#x27;t think anyone is talking more than a decade or few. Countries sell land, so think of it that way, at worst. The clean up is also super expensive. And, over 1000 people died from evacuation-related issues. I guess that&#x27;s just a factor when you move older people around, for any reason. So, yes Fukushima sucked, but in context, given the incompetence, it seems very encouraging. Unless we act even more stupid and get a large disaster, why would it be worse?<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, the estimates of cancer are really low. But you&#x27;re right, there might be a few directly related deaths over the next several decades.<p>You&#x27;d think this would result in an attitude of wanting to push newer designs and so on, but running away is a more human reaction, it seems. :(",1433297110

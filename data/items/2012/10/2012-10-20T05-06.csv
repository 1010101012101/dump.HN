4676456,comment,4675857,4676343,3,0,olalonde,,,"Yeah, we have this same rant every few weeks on HN (I admit this one is pretty well written and features an interesting back story). The biggest problem I see with the expected value math is that it only factors in the money side of the equation. A lot of entrepreneurs (most entrepreneurs?) are doing a ""go big or go home"" startup for <i>many</i> reasons, money not necessarily being the primary one. If all Melanie cares about is money (I bet that's not the case), she'd probably have a higher ""expected value"" at studying medicine and becoming a surgeon.<p>Anyways, as a Silicon Valley outsider, it's weird to see those blog posts encouraging people <i>not</i> to take VC money. Is there actually so much pressure on taking VC money that people actually feel the need to write posts like this? Seems like a first-""first world"" problem to me...<p>edit: Here's an interesting take on expected value by a statistician: <a href=""http://simplexify.net/blog/2012/5/6/i-am-a-statistician-and-i-buy-lottery-tickets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplexify.net/blog/2012/5/6/i-am-a-statistician-and-...</a><p>> So why do I still buy lottery tickets? Definitely not for the expected monetary return on investment. I think of it as a discretionary entertainment spend. I get literally hours of enjoyment from fantasizing what Id do if I won. I happily spend $25 for two hours of entertainment at the movies, and I dont judge the value of that experience based on its expected return. For me, a lottery ticket for the occasional big draw has just as much entertainment value, or more, than the many other things that I spend money on to entertain myself.<p>I bet this line of thought applies to a lot of startup founders.",1350712655
4676455,comment,4675857,4676250,3,0,runako,,,"I generally agree with your post, but:<p>>> If the business is so great why sell? The act of selling implies you think it's worth less than what someone else is willing to pay which is dishonest.<p>There are a lot of reasons to sell any asset. Life changes, changing locations, or simply want to move on to some other area of interest after building a business for many years. Or since you've been sleeping at the office the last few years at the behest of your VCs, you just want to take a few years off. All of these factors affect how much your business is worth to <i>you</i>. (And only you; whether you have to sleep at the office has no bearing on the value of your company to a buyer, but it might make you receptive to a lower price). Ask a founder during one of the highs, she'll tell you her business is  worth 10x-100x the price she'd quote you during one of the lows.<p>Second, a company's value is relative to its owner. For example, The Coca-Cola Company can sell a lot more Vitaminwater in a year than its prior owners due to its global scope, relationships, etc. So Vitaminwater is worth more to Coca-Cola than to the previous owners (who would be able to extract less value from it in a given timeframe). Another example: Vitaminwater would be worth a lot less to IBM than it is to Coca-Cola. So when the company sold, it should have priced somewhere between the expected amount its owners could derive and the (higher) amount Coca-Cola could derive in the same timeframe. There's absolutely nothing dishonest about this.<p>>> Why shouldn't a VC hold on to the great business they've built for the sake of future cash flow?<p>This isn't the VC's business. Their LPs didn't provide them capital for this purpose, so operating companies in this fashion might be a breach of fiduciary duties etc. More to the point, they will likely be bad at it over the long term because their core business is essentially banking (and not operating tech or whatever businesses).",1350712631

I doubt you would say that DHH or Tim Ferris have 'given up' and 'settled in their twenties.' I even say outright, that my point is to follow your own path, and make your own rules, rather than listen to the hype and tech press.<p>I am advocating for a worldview where getting VC funding is not an accomplishment in and of itself, and does not necessarily mean you are successful. By taking funding, you are giving up the opportunity to work for yourself. You are 'hiring a boss,' so to speak. And for me, after working for others for years in finance, and then as a CEO of a funded start-up, I decided I would rather forge my own path in life, prestige and press be damned.",1350712540

My girlfriend (an interaction designer/visual communications graduate) really kicks my butt here, but then there is pressure in her field for her to learn programming :)<p>Writing (and perhaps presentation) is another skill we should develop. Writing is not just about communication, but it also aids in idea refinement.<p>On the other hand, even though I'm all for zen and all, I think spirtual skills are deeply personal and not necessary. Social skills are also very relative, and if you struggle with these your career as a programmer is not over! Same for biz skills, no one has to be a jack of all trades, but you'll probably absorb these skills at your own pace as you advance in your career.",1350709629

4676398,comment,4674891,4675811,32,0,ChuckMcM,,,"No it doesn't. It never did. However from a marketing / market acceptance perspective, it was a requirement. When you introduce a technology like flash you have to ask ""Who is going to use this?"" and ""How?"" The first mass market winner for flash was smartphones and digital cameras. Remember when Apple bought all the available Flash to launch the second generation iPhone? That flash capacity wasn't needed when people weren't building a new brand of camera or phone so some folks started putting this tech into USB sticks, and those were <i>really</i> popular. So the USB sticks and digital cameras and USB based card readers all made the flash appear like a disk drive and that meant that it could immediately be put to use by consumers. And <i>that</i> sort of cemented the idea that ""Flash is for disks"" into the minds of many people and folks have built a huge market around that.<p>Of course what started this revolution was memory, or EPROM to be precise. Back when dinosaurs walked the earth you stored firmware in a chip that physically had a window on the top of it. This was a ""memory"" chip that you would write by injecting charge into a transistor gate by forcing electrons to tunnel across to it (or out of it depending on the technology). But you needed a special programmer to do that, and to erase it, you had to get rid of those charges so you literally shined an ultraviolet light thru the window and the photons kicked the electrons right out of dodge. It was painful and the chip companies responded with something called ""EEPROM"" or electrically erasable programmable readonly memory. Which you could erase with a special high voltage signal on the motherboard doing the work of the ultraviolet lamp in previous generations. As density grew and the erase time shortened, manufacturers added the ability to only erase part of the memory but they could do that reasonably quickly ""in a flash"" as it were, and to distinguish memories that could be quickly erased from those which used older, and slower, technologies they started calling them ""Flash"" memories.<p>Of course as the article points out, Flash is nothing at all like a Hard drive, that people use it that way is an artifact. It much more closely represents the characteristics of something called ""Drum Memory"" [1] which, back when actual random access memory was very expensive to produce, made computers better. The reason was that a drum had a lot of heads and spun a piece of ferro magnetic material under those fixed heads. What this meant was that there was no 'seek' time, you picked the head you wanted electronically and you could read and write a few hundred to a couple of kilobytes of data. This enabled virtual memory in a big way because if you matched the amount of data on the drum with a 'page' of memory you could simply write out a page of memory or read in a page of memory faster than either tape or disk. The only problem was that you had to read all of the drum's track and write all of the track so a read-modify-write cycle meant reading in the track, modifying it, and the rewriting the entire track. Sound familiar? It should that is exactly how flash ended up working.<p>So here you have a random access memory that started life as a memory, but gained commercial acceptance as a pseudo disk drive, and a generation of programmers and system designers who had never heard about drum memory or considered it as something other than a curious artifact of the ""before time"" when people stored data as dots on a cathode ray tube for heavens sake. But they should have paid attention, because that is exactly where flash belongs. Sitting ""beside"" really fast dynamic ram, and even faster static ram (which is on chip and usually called level 1, level 2, or level 3 cache memory. If you remember Jeff Dean's observation about latencies every programmer should know [2], you would notice that reading 4K bytes from DRAM was on the order of .5 to 1 micro-seconds, and reading / writing 4K of memory from the network was 10 uS, and 4k read/write from disk - closer to 15000 microseconds (or 15 milleseconds). Reading 4K from flash on the PCI bus is on the order of 4 uS. Somewhere between getting it from the network and getting it from RAM. But the reason it is so much faster from the PCI bus is that you just map the PCI address space into memory space and memcpy from flash to RAM.<p>If you compare latency and bandwidth to going through an SSD interface you find that not only do you have a whole bunch of kernel between you and the SATA chip, which has its own protocol and drivers, you are constrained to a 6 gbit pipe which is probably shared with other SATA ports on the same SATA controller chip. From a systems architecture perspective attaching flash to your machine through an SSD plug is lame.<p>Now that said folks have started figuring this out. So people like Intel make PCI Flash cards, big chunks o memory like things. And all of the wear leveling is built into the flash controller just like the dynamic memory refresh logic is built into the DRAM controller. The processor sees something that looks like memory, occasionally operations take longer than expected if the controller is in the middle of something. The current challenge though is that so far folks think selling you the same flash chips that you can buy for $2/GB as an SSD should cost $200/GB as a PCI card. That math is seriously holding back flash, and the fact that the best slot to use for flash is the one your video card is sitting in (16x PCIe) and Intel has yet to add another 16x PCIe port for non-volatile memory cards, or added architectural support for putting PCI address resources into the page table. That will happen though, when I can't predict but it will because people keep asking for it and it makes some really killer server architectures possible.<p>[1] A pretty decent write up on drum memory from Wikipedia - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_memory</a><p>[2] A github copy of Jeff Dean's observation updated with Flash SSDs - <a href=""https://gist.github.com/2841832"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/2841832</a>",1350709610

As a musician turned math enthusiast, I think the thought processes involved in the creation of music parallel those involved in the creation of proofs quite nicely. My obsession with music seems to complement my obsession with mathematics on some level that I cannot quite define. As far as I know, there is not a distinctly important practical relationship between math and music (please correct me if I am wrong), but I still feel as though there is some connection.

It's obviously terribly, horrifically designed... but it was at one time one of the most popular sites on the web.  Not because it was pixel perfect, but because the social mechanics were designed very well.<p>Now look at Facebook. It's better designed from a visual and usability standpoint, and I think that gave them a little bit of an edge.  But again, what really seems to have driven Facebook's growth is incredibly well designed social mechanics. Photo tagging is huge, for example. The News Feed is a huge engine for growth.<p>So, I think the answer is that it depends what you mean by ""site design"".  A clean visual design, or even good usability may not be as important as a clean social design, or a clean API design.<p>As a designer you need to understand what are the key bottlenecks in meeting your goals, and design the heck out those.<p>Once you're Apple and you have a bajillion dollars, you can afford to polish the insides of your battery cases.

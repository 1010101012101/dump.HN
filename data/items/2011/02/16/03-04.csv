2224832,comment,2223514,2224604,0,0,vacri,,,"I have found the opposite - by using a handle on a debate site, I've been able to float very taboo topics that have ended up being pretty illuminating and illustrative that I never would have engaged in if I was 'protecting my name and keeping away from the crazies'.<p>One example was in an online debate about a report of necrophiliac abuse of cadavers in a funeral home. Highly emotive topic and sets off the rage in most folks. But myself and a few others were able to look at it a bit more discretely - and through discussion examined where the harm lay: not to the person whose body was so affected (as they're dead) but to the family should they find out (you may disagree, but this helped illuminate something for me about 'bags of chemicals' vs 'human being'). This isn't to say I think necrophilia shouldn't be a crime, but that where the harm is done is somewhere other than the knee-jerkers think it is. Ultimately discussion of this ultra-taboo topic gave me insight to the human condition and was another brick in the understanding-how-things-are-instead-of-how-they-look edifice.<p>If I had've used my real name in a discussion like that, I would never have pursued it. Some people are blinded by rage and emotion and advancing an unpopular viewpoint is simply inviting someone stupid in the middle of a rage to do something harmful to you without rationally thinking about it.

For eg : <a href=""http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/assign.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/assign.html</a><p>If you are going to complain about a self assignment check in the assignment operator function, maybe you should stay away from any kind of programming at all.<p>And I don't understand this complaining about which subset of C++ needs to be used. I have written scala code and it most definitely does not use every feature of scala.<p>The scenarios in which any of the C++ features need to be used is fairly obvious.<p>1. STL - use it all the time, it is one of the core libraries of modern C++\n2. templates/overloading - You will use these features when you use STL. You typically won't create you own template classes.\n3. exceptions - This is one of the C++ features used less often. Dealing with it is no different from dealing with exceptions in other languages like Java.<p>> I find boost pleasurable to use; however looking at boost source is enough to melt my mind.<p>The idea is that you use boost source and not look at it. boost libraries are a very specialized kind of template meta-programming code that only container writers have to deal with. I like being able to use a smart_ptr without having to worry about silly memory leaks, none of which would have been possible without templates or operator overloading in plain vanilla C.<p>There are several deficiencies with C++, that I experience on a day to day basis, none of which are discussed in any of these online C++ rants. I have never faced any software engineering issues because of the multitude of C++ features. That has never been the problem. If anything all these features reduce the amount of boiler plate that I need to write to get my job done.<p>You may not like STL iterators, but they are a 1000 times better than some of the gnarly C macros I have seen in C code to get STL like containers in C. Once you have seen that kind of C code, you will be glad about the existence of templates.",1297827257

What kind of professional web development shop is going to make that kind of commitment when the tests themselves aren't pinned down, or to make any legally binding commitment that their finished product will work properly with software that is beyond their control and not fully specified? You can't even defend this position on the basis of Agile development practices, because a six week cycle is still too short to get through a full round of development, a full set of testing at the various levels required, and final approvals, before the goalposts move again. You don't seem to acknowledge this scenario at all, but outside of relatively small projects it is the norm.<p>As several of us have observed elsewhere in the discussion, the major problem with making this kind of open-ended commitment when the target platform isn't known yet is that sometimes support <i>doesn't</i> improve over time.

What is to stop the next platform from offering 19%, 20% or even 25% non exclusive cut and 15% Exclusive? Competing over the percent of profits taken per app could start a chain reaction race to the bottom that ultimately reduces profits for all platform makers and moves it into the hands of the developers. Which is a good result for developers but not so ideal for the platform makers. So they may all choose to not steer things in that direction for as long as possible.<p>Also I may be missing something but I don't think reducing margins is typical Apple. They have no problem charging you more with the backing that the experience you get will be top quality and polish compared to the competition. No matter that you are user, developer or publisher.That is their leverage.  Their brand is associated with quality, heck given their image of vigorously (note use of vigour v rigour) curated excellence, exclusivity might even be a positive signal to consumers and some developers.<p>These two points make it so I would actually be more surprised by a reduced percentage trade for exclusivity than outright requirement of exclusivity.",1297825661

Next time I went back (in common with another commenter here) I couldn't generally access solutions despite having provided some of those solutions myself.<p>However, I did find that it was, when I joined, the best place to get in depth computing  answers. My last question there was in 2009 and I still got a pretty useful answer. I've used it since for a couple of specific searches.<p>Having looked there once again it still looks like I might get useful answers there.<p>Sample of questions being asked now:<p><pre><code>    16/02/11 	500 	Google Maps to be placed in a MS...

Not bikes, not segways, none of that.  They should be out walking around, talking to people.  IMHO, I should know who the cops assigned to my neighborhood are.<p>Here&#x27;s a thing that happened last week that highlights a problem I have with the cops:<p>At about 1:30 in the morning, my dog starts doing her dog thing and informing me that IMMINENT DOOM is upon us in the form of somebody being outside of the house.  I get up and walk to the kitchen to find that, yes, indeed somebody is outside of the door trying to get in, which is a <i>scary</i> feeling.  I don&#x27;t have a peephole on that door, it&#x27;s the middle of the night, and they aren&#x27;t knocking, they&#x27;re trying to get the handle to open.<p>Now, luckily I&#x27;m a pretty huge guy, so while this was scary, it didn&#x27;t really seem life threatening, (they weren&#x27;t trying to bust through the door, just trying to come inside, so probably just a very disoriented person).  Eventually, they left, and I went back to bed.<p>A few minutes later, however, we heard a car alarm go off next door, indicating that the person had just moved on to the neighbor&#x27;s house, which is really sad, because there is an old lady that lives next door, who might not brush off the idea of somebody trying to come into her house as readily as I could.<p>I go outside and find out that the person trying to come in was a ~20 year old girl who couldn&#x27;t have weighed more than 110lbs soaking wet.  Basically the least threatening person imaginable, but she <i>was</i> trying to get into the neighbor&#x27;s house.<p>One part of my life involves volunteering for a group of people who deal specifically with this sort of thing at a big dessert party that lots of people in SF have probably heard of.  My mode switched from being worried about the lady next door, to being worried about the obviously confused kid trying to get into somebody&#x27;s house.<p>I loudly convinced her to come and talk to me away from the lady-next-door&#x27;s house (so as to make sure that the lady inside, who I am sure was scared, could hear that everything was alright), and we started trying to figure out where she was supposed to be, and a plan to get her to that place safely.  Sidenote: turns out she just has some really shitty friends who more or less ditched her and went home.<p>While I was talking to her, the cops showed up (presumably my neighbor called them), and I got to see how they would have handled the situation.<p>There was a guy just riding his bike by the neighbor&#x27;s house, and the cops started YELLING at him<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;<p>&quot;Just riding home.&quot;<p>&quot;Huh, why are you here?  Why are you riding here?  Huh?  Why here?  What are you doing?  Is this your house?  What are you doing?  Do you know you can&#x27;t be here?  This is an alleyway you can&#x27;t ride here [EVERYBODY rides their bike in the alley, which is practically a bike path], why are you here?  This is illegal.  What are you doing here?&quot;<p>Just started machine-gunning questions at this poor dude who happened to be riding by at the wrong time.<p>Eventually, they figured out that the girl I was talking to was the person that they were looking for.  I explained to them who she was, what she was doing, and where she needed to be.<p>The thing that absolutely FLOORED me was that they refused to give her a ride home.  They wanted to stick this obviously disoriented, possibly drugged, girl into a cab (a fucking CAB!  Yikes!), and make her into the cabby&#x27;s problem (hey, get into this random car and hopefully this drugged up girl will make it home safe!)<p>Luckily they did NOT do this, because the girl said she didn&#x27;t have any cash.  The ended up calling some sort of non-police-police van who gave her a ride to [hopefully] her house.  (It was their Crisis Intervention Team, I think.  Like people who show up and talk to people who have just had a traumatic experience, I guess they weren&#x27;t busy, and had time to give this girl a ride).<p>--<p>Watching the whole thing was just sad to me.  Not only was the FIRST response that the cops had to start yelling at some dude, but when presented with a REAL opportunity to improve somebody&#x27;s safety (this girl), they either didn&#x27;t want to, or were not allowed to.<p>Keeping some disoriented girl safe in the middle of the night seems like the cliche of what cops are supposed to be doing, and here when presented with the opportunity, they wouldn&#x27;t do it.<p>Pathetic.",1449791786

In reality, I&#x27;m not sure there is an easy way to talk about reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces without all that functional analysis, which is a tough topic.  I would argue that&#x27;s probably the greatest thing holding back kernels - their high barrier to entry.<p>I&#x27;ll spend one line here to mention my book (kernel-based approximation methods in Matlab) and also say that it is pretty heavy on the theory; the second half of the book deals with reproducing kernels as used in a variety of fields, but getting there requires a lot of very tough math.<p>Lemme take a moment to list places (some more real-world than others) where I know that reproducing kernels pop up - and anyone else reading this please feel free to add to this list:<p>1) Approximation theory - My bread and butter and the most important role for kernels as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  When you have scattered data (especially in higher dimensions) and you want to interpolate and predict unobserved values, reproducing kernels give you several very nice guarantees.  Through this, they also pop up in computer vision or surface reconstruction from point cloud data.<p>2) Spatial statistics - They actually play an identical role in kriging as they do in approximation theory, albeit for totally different reasons.  People who are doing remote sensing or topological mapping may use reproducing kernels (or software that uses these kernels.<p>3) Machine learning - Both RBF networks and support vector machines use reproducing kernels, although in two different ways.  The mechanism by which they are used in support vector machines (feature maps) is difficult for me to understand which is why I don&#x27;t talk about them much.  They are still a very important field that uses kernels.<p>4) Differential equations - The same theory that makes reproducing kernels work for approximation theory also works for numerically solving differential equations.  You could lump stuff regarding Green&#x27;s functions in here too, although those may not be reproducing kernels.<p>5) Numerical integration - Especially for integration in higher dimensions, basically all the theory of convergence for quasi Monte Carlo methods relies on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.<p>Maybe the best thing I can point you to is the same place where I first learned about this stuff: math.iit.edu/~fass/590.  That&#x27;s an old (recently updated) class website from a class I took at the Illinois Institute of Technology when I was an undergrad there.  Dr. Fasshauer does an outstanding job putting notes and slides for his class together.<p>If you&#x27;re feeling adventurous, I would recommend our book, but a good starting point would be his class notes, which I still turn back to often and are written to introduce graduate students (who know nothing about kernels) to the topic.  I&#x27;ll work on putting together a list of good application-oriented sources as well.<p>Thanks for your interest!

It&#x27;s more about being aware, anticipating events, preventing problems, and having a plan B.&quot;<p>&quot;anticipating events&quot;<p>I feel like maybe you are just making quick conversation, but do you not see the contradiction? I used to ride a motorcycle everywhere, and I took some pretty advanced motorcycle courses while in the military (on par with motorcycle cop courses), and me riding defensively certainly is me anticipating horrible events and avoiding them.<p>I think one downside to the evolution of car safety is that what it turns people who drive all the time (don&#x27;t walk, ride bikes or motorcycles) into what motorcyclist call &quot;cagers&quot;... that is they don&#x27;t see anything smaller than their vehicle, and that they have a lack of respect for the power of a vehicle. So I keep an eye out particularly for &quot;cagers&quot;.<p>Example, me going down access road, I see soccer-mom suv 400 yards up ready to right hand turn into same lane, I notice kids in the back and vehicle nudging forward indicating it&#x27;s in a rush... I am going to eagle eye the intentions of that vehicle and have already shifted my weight and moved further to the left in the lane.<p>If I failed to do these things, and the vehicle pulled out in front of me... I would most likely be dead on the spot.<p>Now, back to the subject, I think the real point is that you should be able to read a situation and expect the worst but hope for the best, and use your skills to respond in a way the de-escalates and reduces risk to all involved, and it is that last part that the majority of police are failing to do.<p>A lot of my old buddies went contractor (aka mercenary), but a few did join the force. I always told them I knew I couldn&#x27;t be a police officer because I had such a muscle memory for killing... I think the real problem is that we have allowed a military people who got used to occupation operations to transition into police work without correcting that mind-set for how they interact with people. We are not in a war zone here... and we don&#x27;t want to make it one either! (which seems to be what is happening)<p>Police officers should be peace officers, not storm troopers.<p>While I&#x27;m on the subject, I have two very particular gripes with current police conduct:<p>1. Lack of trigger discipline and willingness to unholster their weapon, and lack of barrel discipline once their weapon is out.<p>2. Unconstitutional police methods such as no-knock warrants, often hitting the wrong house which could have been avoided with some simple police work.<p>You combine the two and you get something like my brother in arms in Arizona, a Marine who was shot at least 22 times by a bunch of undisciplined trigger heavy fucktards posing as a SWAT team.<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/25/jose-guerena-arizona-_n_867020.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/25/jose-guerena-arizon...</a><p><a href=""http://www.policestateusa.com/2013/jose-guerena-settlement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.policestateusa.com/2013/jose-guerena-settlement/</a>",1449790208

10714285,comment,10713625,10713625,0,0,guscost,,,"What&#x27;s currently in your JavaScript stack? I&#x27;m probably going to suggest getting rid of most of it if possible so that you can focus on your code. Here&#x27;s a dirty secret: you probably don&#x27;t need a JS build system or anything from ES2015+ if you don&#x27;t feel like learning it yet[0]. If you&#x27;re using React, you probably don&#x27;t need to integrate any of the latest tech like Redux and tcomb-form and all those other super cool innovations. You can even get away with using Node modules in the old-fashioned &quot;link to a script file&quot; way[1]. Sure, someone can claim that each of those tools serves a purpose and can prevent a whole class of headaches that might happen. What they won&#x27;t say is that trying to wrangle them all together right away is causing you a bigger headache than any of the others!<p>I&#x27;m working on an application that has about 15K lines of hand-prepared React/Flux JavaScript (well, TypeScript) and it is planned to scale up by maybe an order of magnitude eventually. It&#x27;s built with ES5 and plain old revealing modules. I&#x27;m managing dependencies by hand. I&#x27;m not using Node or CommonJS modules at all. Heck, I&#x27;m not even using JSX yet because my version of Visual Studio doesn&#x27;t have TSX (TypeScript+JSX) built in. Does this mean some headaches and extra labor? Sure! Do I feel like an imposter when reading about all this awesome fancy new stuff? Sometimes!<p>But the headaches are surprisingly minor and barely figure in most of the time. If/when these headaches get bigger (I suspect this will start in earnest when more front-end developers join the project), then I&#x27;ll take another look at integrating a module loader, or a form generator, or an automagic React router, or a super-cool atomic state system like Redux. In case you&#x27;re wondering the application works amazingly well and most of the time implementing even far-out crazy features has been easy and fun.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t get too worried about making the &quot;wrong&quot; choices, and don&#x27;t bail out for something newer when you hit your first roadblock. Most of the options you have available these days work great! The things we expect them to do are totally incredible, that&#x27;s the only reason people are still proposing alternatives all the time.<p>[0]If you don&#x27;t need to support older browsers, ES2015 is pretty easy to include. Otherwise if you need to use examples based on an ES2015+ version, just paste the code into the Babel REPL: <a href=""https://babeljs.io/repl/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://babeljs.io/repl/</a><p>[1]You can get any bundled npm module here: <a href=""https://wzrd.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wzrd.in/</a>",1449788789

14779,comment,14778,14778,0,0,Tichy,,,"Just found this page when I was googling for the business cards. I guess it won't interest many people, but anyway, I applied to YC with a similar idea (I think, from the superficial looks of it). Rejected, but my application was not put together very well (last minute thing), and besides, it might just not be YCs area of interest.",1177015918

The need for joins can be alleviated with pointers, and sorting and grouping can be done in the application.<p>The tricky part would be the synchronization and transactional aspects, and if the system became sufficiently distributed that part could get fairly nasty.",1177015756

14775,comment,14756,14756,0,0,Tichy,,,"This and the other business card thread reminds me of an idea for a business card I once had. I don't even know how it is called, but there is this kind of plastic coating for paper that consists of stripes of lenses, so that you see something different on the paper depending on the angle you look at it from (usually this is used on cheap gadgets for children). It turns out you can create pictures for that at home, at least a popular computer magazine claimed so some time ago and explained how to do it.<p>Being into games design at the time, I dreamed about showing an animation on my business card (a flying space ship, or space invaders perhaps?). In the end I was unable to find that plastic coating anywhere (I gave up too soon), and abandoned the idea. <p>Maybe I should pick it up again, but then again business cards seem also a bit yesterday. My second favorite design from ideo is the device that scans the business card and then burns it on the spot ( ;-) <a href=""http://www.ideo.com/identity/cardpyre.htm"">http://www.ideo.com/identity/cardpyre.htm</a> ) ",1177015471

14764,comment,13944,14763,0,0,edgeztv,,,"The only thing I wish Java had is closures, but they are actually under consideration for a future Java release!<p>Right now you can get similar behavior with anonymous inner classes, but it leads to more clutter than necessary.<p>This demonstrates another good argument in favor of java - it is always evolving to make programming in it more enjoyable.  It was difficult to use collection classes at first, but version 1.5 introduced generics.  It sucked to use the iterator pattern with collections, but now java has a ""for each"" loop.  It sucked not having enums, but now Java has them too, etc.  Not to mention that every new Java release brings a ton of new library classes and enhancements.",1177014020
14763,comment,13944,13944,0,0,edgeztv,,,"Aren't strongly & statically typed languages an evolutionary improvement over dynamic & loosely typed languages that let you shoot yourself in the foot all the time?  <p>A Java IDE in a sense ""knows"" what you're writing and helps you avoid making mistakes while you're coding. <p>People complain about too much boilerplate code in java - that's true, but it can actually be a good thing in the same way comments can be a good thing, and IDEs generate all the boilerplate for you with just a couple of keystrokes (whereas comments don't write themselves).<p>I'm curious whether the Java bashers out there have ever used a good IDE like Eclipse or IDEA for any extended period of time. Because if you're using a text editor like emacs, programming in Java can seem ridiculously difficult.  Conversely it might seem ridiculously difficult for a person accustomed to an IDE to use a text editor for a scripting language.<p>Coding Java without an IDE is like trying to control the space shuttle with a steering wheel.  Once you've mastered all the features of an IDE, however, (which can take years, but then again so does learning emacs) programming in Java becomes a breeze and you get all the benefits of static typing (with the safety and tools it enables) and the vast Java libraries with no extra difficulty coding compared to a simpler language.",1177013816

4498775,comment,4495884,4498703,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Correlation is statistical evidence.<p>Yes -- evidence of a correlation, not a cause-effect relationship.<p>> Of course your example is a cause-effect relationship.<p>Puddles and rain? Yes, but it is only a description, not an explanation. Science requires explanations. Otherwise we open the door to pseudoscience, to people claiming any associations they care to claim.<p>> Please, don't warp the meaning of the word ""predict"".<p>It is you who is doing that -- look at the definitions at the bottom of this post.<p>Here's another example. I have a cure for the common cold -- I shake a dried gourd over the patient's head until he get better. Sometimes it takes a week, but my treatment always works. The correlation is perfect, therefore I deserve a Nobel Prize for ridding the world of this scourge.<p>My dried gourd treatment ""predicts"" that the cold sufferer will get better -- always.<p>> I'm simply insisting the word ""predict"" has to do with correlation, not causation.<p>And you are mistaken. Rain is a predictor for bumper crops, but bumper crops are not a predictor for rain. Teenage driving is a predictor for car crashes, but car crashes are not a predictor for teenage driving.<p>A recent bogus study found a correlation between marijuana use and lower IQ. But the marijuana use did not predict the IQ drop, it was only correlated with it, and the researchers included this fact in their article. Needless to say, the science journalists ignored the qualifiers in the article and announced that marijuana use <i>predicted</i> a fall in IQ:<p><a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/08/27/teenage-marijuana-use-may-hurt-future-iq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/08/27/teenage-mariju...</a><p>Here's another account of the same study that makes a claim in its title that the article body contradicts. Title: ""Smoking Pot In Teen Years Lowers IQ Later"". A quote from the article: ""But those who consistently smoke marijuana may simply make less intellectually stimulating choices at critical points in life.""<p>Here is another bogus study: ""Low I.Q. Predicts Heart Disease"":<p><a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/low-i-q-predicts-heart-disease/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/low-i-q-predicts-he...</a><p>Except for the fact that it's only a correlation, and use of the term ""predicts"" is nonsense. Needless to say, the article doesn't consider that the low IQ might predict the heart disease, not the reverse.<p>> I'm simply insisting the word ""predict"" has to do with correlation, not causation.<p>Yes, and you are mistaken.<p><a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/predict"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/predict</a><p>""to declare or tell in advance; prophesy; foretell: to predict the weather; to predict the fall of a civilization.""<p><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predict"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predict</a><p>""to declare or indicate in advance; especially : <i>foretell on the basis of observation, experience, or scientific reason</i>""<p>Q.E.D.",1347263903

Then, after I pointed out that you did, indeed, do something wrong, turns out you did it because ""you were attacked strongly"". This is a common behavior in elementary school, and not an acceptable mode of conduct in adult age, especially from a technical Ph.D.<p>1) There are plenty of people on HN who don't bow down before VCs. See patio11, mechanical_fish, tptacek etc. They are not voted down into oblivion, so it is likely that the reason why you are being downvoted has nothing to do with your particular opinion of VCs.<p>2) I looked through your comment history on the site. You tend to write long, rambling, stream-of-consciousness walls of text - this is true not just of this thread, but of many others over the last two months. Different commenters have pointed out that they do not enjoy reading your posts precisely because of that reason. Frankly, I don't either. So, I'm pretty sure that's why you were, as you say, ""strongly attacked"". It is perfectly acceptable to downvote comments for presentation rather than substance, and that happens on HN quite often. If you think that the substance of your comments is so important that presentation doesn't matter, you and HN are both better off if you leave.",1347263720

A general rule of thumb when using C++ is that you shouldn't use Boost.  Boost is a source of major headaches -- even in innocuous looking parts like smart pointers.  There are many reasons to avoid it in general, the most important one being compile times, because boost developers are terrible at avoiding creating long compile times.  You can reimplement a boost header (for example, for uuid, shared_ptr, intrusive_ptr, and so on) and get a significant compile time speed-up.  The other problem with boost libraries is that they lack assertions that are appropriate for software development.  For example, with a scoped_ptr, it is better to have an init(T *) method that asserts the object has not been initialized, not just a general reset method, because with most uses of scoped_ptr<T>::reset() (in code that I've worked with) you're expecting it to currently be empty.<p>(Edit: Also, boost libraries are intimidating because the documentation is bad.)<p>4.

In the future, they wouldn't let me comment in positive terms about apple pie.<p>The main reason for the attack was clear:  I was commenting on how venture capital could do better, and that is a sensitive subject on HN.  Further, the VC community is wildly arrogant and just insists on pretending to be the smartest guys in the room.  So, no way do they want public comments on their work, comments that presume to tell them better ways to do their work.  And, since the venture partners are rarely significantly technical, they are insecure and defensive about their qualifications and, thus, especially fear and resent a technical Ph.D. commenting on their work.  Especially the VCs don't want comments that go around them to their LPs, who now are unhappy with VC returns.  So, in the end the issue is VC and HN ego.<p>The HN mods are hot on slapping down any commenter who fails to bow deeply enough before the VCs.  So, they slapped me down.  In the end, that is the shame of HN and its mods and a display of their absurd ego.  I did nothing wrong but defend myself.<p>The world is what it is.

There are lots of readings for students about how to become a new Darwin or Einstein.<p>To make a paradigm shift one should pick up a special kind of person (let's call him <i>focused, disciplined introvert</i>) place this person in a good environment (or just help the  person to make one for himself) and it must be done in a right moment - create a wave others will try to catch and ride.

A sample of two ""rock stars"" doesn't seem to be enough to draw conclusions from it.<p>For instance, whereas Airbnb can admittedly be seen as a questionable idea (but not outright bad), Dropbox (the idea, before implementation) sounds like a very good idea. Maybe not a $7b idea, but still very good.<p>Of course, among the YC funded startups, there may be a lot of ideas that sounded bad at first; but if all those startups are in fact financially irrelevant, should they be used to try to build a theory of success?<p>- - -<p>It's interesting to learn that if YC funded 10x more startups they would be just as successful (and maybe more, since there could be a big success in the startups that are left out) -- it means that if the selection process rate is around 10%, YC could do without it entirely, with no significant effect to its bottom line.<p>Also, I took this picture this summer\n<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/B30hL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/B30hL.jpg</a>",1347260721

In case of startup seed funding the risk are much higher but profits are high too (like 1000x). Now an investor can make profit by selling their share to other (future) investors. The point to note here is: the first investor sells thinking that the ventures value has reached a reasonable price which was expected or its now overpriced.<p>The point is, profit has to be booked to be realized.My question to PG is how does YC decide when to sell?",1347260632

Here's a scenario: 100 people who don't want to live next to high rises but are perfectly fine living next to other single-family dwellings buy up 100 acres of land in LibertarianUtopiaLand and chop it up. They then sign a contract amongst themselves requiring community consent if any of them are going to drastically change their property, and require that any transfer of the land be accompanied by the same provision. Sounds quite familiar.<p>There's no national regulation saying that every community must use the same planning methods.

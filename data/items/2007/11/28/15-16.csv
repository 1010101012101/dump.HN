84289,comment,84091,84275,0,0,edw519,,,"Sorry if I was a bit blunt.  Let me try to explain it a little better...<p>This is hacker news.  One of the primary beliefs here (correct me if I'm wrong) is that this is the best time ever for one or two good hackers to start a business if you can build something people want.  Why?  The incredibly low cost of entry, available technology, tremendous demand, etc.  All you need is some skill, some smarts, a couple of laptops, and whole lot of determination.  You don't even need much money.  That's the good news.<p>Now the not-so-good news (for non-hackers).  This is a sufficient condition.  BUT IT IS ALSO A NECESSARY CONDITION.  You gotta be able to hack.  If you can't, then why bother?<p>I know.  I know.  You need both development and design.  Design without development is a brochure.  Development without design (although not a good idea) can be a sustainable business.  Just ask google.<p>Many hackers here already do work for big companies for pretty decent $.  And we're still unhappy because we want better.  We want our own.  A web/tech/software business has to be founded by hackers; anything else doesn't make much sense to me.<p>Didn't mean to sound so negative to the original poster.  Maybe they ARE good hackers.  But if not, they need at least one rock star hacker as a co-founder, not a freelancer.<p>This post kinda reminds me of opening a dentist's office if you can do everything needed except fix teeth.  Imagine an ad, ""Dental Hygienist and Office Manager looking to hire a freelancer to fix teeth.""  If I'm a dentist (who is any good), why would I respond to that ad?  I'd just open my own practice.  Why should hackers accept any less?",1196265336

Is it marginal cost (on which solar already wins) or return on capital, and does the cost of capital include the cost of research?<p>The only way I can think of actually trying this is to sell future contracts for, say 1% of Google's alt-power production in 2008, 2009, etc., and to declare the project a success iff the value of 1% of the power, indefinitely, X 100, is less than the amount invested in the project.",1196265068

This is a feature not a bug</i><p>I'm not sure I get what you mean. Is it that self-interest leading people to buy the cheapest energy form, environment be damned, is the way to go? What if we find out that the cheapest energy form is polluting just as much (or more) as coal? We can't escape some form of collective responsibility.",1196264854

84277,comment,83538,83538,0,0,nickadams,,,"Charging for your application is a big step -- you are making a statement that what you are offering is of value. <p>I think that if you can offer some premium lever of your software for a price, do it.   <p>My company created billQ (<a href=""http://www.mybillq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mybillq.com</a>). Now this is a VERY specific and simple app, but it is very well done (biased?). At first we offered it completely free. This came partly from fear. Is this simple app really worth charging for? After a few months, and a bunch of feedback, people were actually offering to pay us even though we weren't charging. We learned from this, and the latest version now has a premium level that has more features and costs a small amount. And people pay for it.<p>Most people aren't not going to use your product because of the price, they are not going to use it because it a) isn't useful to them, or b) it sucks. The onus is on you to make the value match the price.<p>If at all possible, charge for your product. It will not only bring you better customers, but it will provide you with the resources to invest back into those customers. And this is something they are more than willing to pay for.<p>I would hope more companies put a value on their products. Web apps shouldn't be just commodities in the same way desktop software is not. If everyone relies solely on ad revenue, there will be a lot of cash-flow starved companies out there.",1196264190

84270,comment,84091,84091,0,0,nickadams,,,"Thanks for the comments guys. <p>To address some things...<p>@edw519 - This isn't a start-up situation. As I said, this would be freelance, (i.e., we pay them). And this is for client work that comes along, not an internal project that would be relevant to an equity situation. I didn't think that hiring freelancers when work exceeded manpower was that ass backwards...<p>@lanej0 - My developer is to an extent, but I was also looking for more resources. Can't hurt to expand right? Also, on your other point, it's tough working with college students because of their schedules. But it is something we've explored.<p>@everyone - I want to stay away from elance and the like. I'm not looking for someone who can low-ball the best, I'm looking for someone who can do great work. Also, job boards  aren't the best either. They are useful for AFTER you get the proposal. I'm looking for resources so that when client work comes in, I'll have some names on hand to contact to determine if I can take on the job. It's kind of a preemptive thing. Too many of these job boards focus on the specific job, not the talent pool.<p>@tmm - A good way to find designers is to check out design galleries and design communities. That way you will be able to judge the talent pretty easily by the work they've done.  A simple email will get the ball rolling. Most designers say whether they are looking for freelance work right in their portfolio.<p>Thanks everyone for the responses! ",1196262870

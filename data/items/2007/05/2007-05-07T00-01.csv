Bill Joy, Bob Kahn, Dan Bricklin, Dan Drake, Tim O'Reilly, Brewster Kahle, Andy Hertzfeld, all well worth watching (the shows come in .ogg as well).",1178497016
20046,comment,20032,20032,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Thanks for the article. Bo Peabody is the newest addition to my list of awesome people.<p>One thing I find contradictory though, is that he says that amazing things happen when smart/inspired people get together, yet Village Ventures funds programs away from VC-filled cities, so companies can work from their local towns. While the argument for the ""home setting"" is there, this is the direct opposite of YC's mode of operation, and I cannot help but agree with YC more on this one.<p>Nevertheless, great guy, much respect. He'd make a great speaker not only for entrepreneurship but also life in general.",1178496928

20040,comment,20032,20032,0,0,zaidf,,,"""In 1991, as a college freshman, I had an idea for an online service offering ""real life"" education to college students: practical advice about jobs, personal finance, and health. I made the simple observations that no one was teaching us these subjects in the classroom, and that computers -- rather than books or TVs -- had become the primary medium of communication and entertainment.""<p>That in itself is extraordinary for a college freshman in 1991.",1178496347

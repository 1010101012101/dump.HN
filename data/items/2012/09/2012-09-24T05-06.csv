4563402,story,,,3,8,chacham15,"Ask pg: Why MUST good startup ideas look like bad ideas initially?",,"You have said many times that ""good startup ideas have to look like bad ideas initially.""<p>The reason that you suggest in your essays that the idea MUST look like a bad idea is because if it didn't then other people would do it. What leads me to doubt whether this is true is the idea that it ignores innovation. Therefore, what if the reason that other people dont do it is simply because they don't know how?<p>For example, if a startup were able to create a piece of software that could take a block of text and produce a summary (not keywords and such, but a real summary that a human would write if asked). I would think that that seems like (and IMO is) a good idea. Here, the problem is how do I do this rather than should I do this.<p>A historic example rather than a theoretical one could be Googles' basic concept of page-rank. It seems like a good idea (this is not just hindsight, IIRC there are even stories about Larry Paige explaining the concept at the time and people thinking that it was genius). Just, how many people at that time thought of it? Even if people did think of it, it still is a technically difficult algorithm when you take into account the sheer amount of data that it must process. So again, the problem is not should I, but rather, how do I.<p>Do you see any error in my logic?",1348466354

Apple demonstrated over and over again that they have no problem killing hardware and software that they feel they must for the sake of progress, or whatever, and you can bet that there's always a team with something at stake when they do that.<p>3) Given the thoroughness of focus on iOS at Apple over the last 5 years, and maps being a rather major change for a key functionality for iPhones, and any smartphone now really, this seems impossible. What I'm not clear on is why Apple didn't expressly announce the feature as a work in progress, or ""beta"", that is at the point that it requires real world usage and feedback to bring it up to the standards of, what are now, significantly more mature products.<p>The Maps app in iOS5 really hasn't changed much since it's launch with the first iPhone while Android, etc. have been able to add features to theirs. My money is on licensing restrictions being the primary culprit behind this and given that Apple's license with Google was up this year, it just seems far too much of a stretch, for the sake of finding any kind of fault in Apple's diamond polished veneer, to assume that Apple had any other intention than wanting to improve the utility of a key mobile computing feature they were otherwise not allowed to do, or were not able to come to agreeable terms with Google when talking about renewing their license. It's unfortunate that it's so significantly lacking in accuracy, but I'm not entirely sure there was much they could do about that before launch beyond removing Maps entirely?",1348466265

Just because customers started finding hilarious problems on days one doesn't mean they're trivially easy to find. With enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.<p>As a digression: I wonder if the fact that Apple is located in Palo Alto has anything to do with the lack of support for public transportation in Maps? Typically the south bay has a significantly less emphasis on public transport (excepting Caltrain and VTA) when compared to San Francisco. It would certainly be interesting to compare UX experiences of apple devs/testers who commute from SF to Palo Alto vs those who lived close by.",1348466079

My take on it is that Apple is, again, losing it's way and the article points out some specific examples.  Things like maps and Facebook integration are just the icing on the cake.  I just can't shake the feeling that Apple doesn't care about the customer anymore.<p>With every new OS release Apple has moved toward homogenization of their product line.  Soon there will be no difference between what's on your desktop and in your pocket, and I think this is a bad thing.  Apple's main strength has always been its ability to attract ""makers"", however with this new direction I see them turning their back on developers, artists, writers, etc.  Maybe that's a valid market and a good long term vision and if so then good for them.<p>However, for the first time in years I am looking for other alternatives for my future computing devices.

There are a ton of smart, talented people working at apple, but no indication of focus or vision. Maybe, after a few years of mourning, apple might be able to do something really new. As it is, all those smart people are going to keep doing what they have been doing. That's ok in most organizations, apple is a race car. It's delicate, fragile, and super fast.

I'm a big fan of Trello for breaking learning goals down into manageable blocks - create a board of your overall goal, then create a list of specific learning outcomes you can tick off as you go (kind of a mash-up of Steven Covey's 'begin with the end in mind' and SMART goals - specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timed).

Functional programming is suited to some tasks. With others the fit is almost tortuous. Imperative programming is well-suited to how we think and how we break down tasks.<p>If you look at the popular languages they're pretty much all multi-paradigm (eg Ruby, Python, Go, C#, arguably even C++/Java) meaning they give you the low-hanging fruit of functional programming while still being in a relative sweet spot of being easy to learn yet reasonably expressive.<p>Why I think Go has a very bright future ahead of it is that it is the first of these multi-paradigm language to combine all these features:<p>- easy to learn (seriously, go look at how short [2] is; you can knock that out in an afternoon);<p>- it is minimal. I LOVE Go's minimal OO model for example; and<p>- it is statically typed.<p>If you look at the other statically typed multi-paradigm languages you have C#, which is generally well-regarded... except (Mono notwithstanding) it is very Windows-centric. Java is, well, Java. C++ is <i>incredibly</i> complicated.<p>The only thing Go is missing is a mode for (semi-)manual memory management. I'm thinking something like Obj-C's ARC (in iOS 5+) and it could well supplant C/C++ for the vast majority of their (already shriking) use cases... eventually (Go has some work to do on speed).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/377082/how-long-does-it-take-for-you-to-be-comfortable-with-haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/377082/how-long-does-it-t...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.miek.nl/projects/learninggo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.miek.nl/projects/learninggo/</a>",1348465365

4563345,comment,4561274,4562943,3,0,simonster,,,"> The National Review is a conservative publication.<p>This is a circumstantial attack. I am a liberal. The person who referred me to this article is a well-respected liberal-leaning science professor at a major research university; I do not read the National Review. Still, I found the article compelling and balanced until somewhere around section 6. In my personal view, it's thoughtful and thought-provoking, and I honestly don't understand why you would flag it beyond that you don't agree with its author's political views or with the venue in which it was published.<p>> The power of government over private enterprises is the ability to guide innovation that may not provide any benefits in the short-term.<p>If I'm reading the last section of the article right, Thiel seems to recognize this (although it's not standard conservative doctrine), but he also seems to think that politicians and the public are no longer interested in science and takes a cheap shot at ""today's aged hippies"" instead of suggesting a solution.<p>> And for Thiel to address stagnant wages without mentioning income equality is so completely disingenuous.<p>""Mean incomes outperformed median incomes (inflation-adjusted in both cases), and there was a trend towards greater inequality."" You're right that he doesn't engage it, and that's part of what makes the last sections of the piece less compelling, but given that this is the first point he uses to demonstrate post-1973 economic stagnation, he's hardly trying to sweep it under the rug.<p>> Lastly, how does Thiel not mention the impact of corporate donations to political campaigns as hamstringing innovations?<p>This is not the reason progress has stagnated (if one believes Thiel's main argument). Corporate donations cannot affect funding for universities and research institutes, since those funding decisions are (rightly) in the hands of scientists at NSF/NIH/DARPA and not politicians. Additionally, it's hard to imagine that the kind of large-scale corruption necessary to halt economic growth could go undetected for decades.<p>The two main questions raised by this article are whether there's a science slowdown, and, if so, why it's happening. These aren't partisan questions (or if they are, the stock conservative answer is definitely not Thiel's), and they made me think, hence my posting this here. The last section seems to be tacked on to appeal to National Review readers, and I'd prefer to ignore it.",1348464673

It is certainly hitting at the right time for iOS, and considering that the transit directions in the old Google-powered iOS Maps app were never very good, this has the ability to give users an even better experience.<p>The supported cities seem strange to me, however. In the US, the first two cities you would develop transit directions for would be New York City and Washington, DC, as they are No. 1 and No. 2 in train/subway use in the country and having by far the best transit. After that you would do the second tier of Chicago, Boston and San Francisco. Then you'd look into less transit-friendly cities.<p>Houston, which is pretty much a giant suburb, is a strange pick to go before more transit dense cities. I do see that the app makers want data in a public GTFS feed. But users won't know what that is. It's up to app and service makers to work with cities, not users. They just want something that works.<p>I say all of this, because the goal of any app launch should be to maximize user uptake and publicity. Skipping major transit cities like DC and Seattle for launch and instead including Houston, San Diego, etc. seems like a wasted opportunity. Shooting up the iOS most popular charts is the best path to success on iOS and city selection, and thus user availability, would be pretty critical here.",1348463679

4563309,comment,4562211,4562770,1,0,ericbb,,,"I would argue that there is an obvious correct answer for array indexing and nil pointer dereference. Go could have been designed to work like the following:<p><pre><code>    x, err := *p
</code></pre>
Where err is nil unless p is nil. And for array indexing:<p><pre><code>    x, err := a[n]
</code></pre>
The runtime could do its bounds check and return (zero, IndexOutOfBoundsError) if the check fails, where zero is the zero-value for the type. It seems to me that these solutions are perfectly workable except for the massive code-size/verbosity explosion they would induce.<p>In such cases, the code should effectively prove that p is not nil and n is within bounds before performing the risky operations. Maybe a good plan is to always validate input first so that you can write expression-oriented code that only fails in the case of programmer error.<p>A situation from my experience was a recursive transformation where an intermediate call had no good way to deal with an error except pass it along to its caller--so I used a panic within the package for that. In hindsight, I think a better solution may have been to validate the input in an earlier pass so that the recursive transformation should always succeed.<p>So, in cases where the program can validate inputs first, it should do so and then be free to use compositional code that panics when the validation was broken. In cases where validation cannot remove error conditions, error-returns should be used.<p>Reserving panic for programmer-error, as luriel recommends in his reply, seems like a good maxim.

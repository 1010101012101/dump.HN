It seems easy to solve, though - I don&#x27;t see why those couldn&#x27;t be integrated into the cars by default. A lot of taxis already have that, they are just sometimes too lazy to take them out.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by personalized car seats - I think there are merely some variations dependent on size of the child? But car seats can grow along with the child, usually you can leave more and more stuff out the older the child gets?<p>Not sure why car sharing services overlook that atm - maybe because most families tend to own a car, so it is not a big market for them?",1401267548

7809004,comment,7796268,7801370,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"You tend to have more control over the way the data is produced than you think, and you should make use of it. It&#x27;s idiotic to work around broken producers over and over and over again, each time with a high risk of introducing some bugs, instead of pushing back and getting the producer fixed once and for all. Often the problem is simply in the perception that somehow broken output is just &quot;not quite right&quot;, and therefore nothing to make a fuss about. That&#x27;s not how reliable data processing works. You have a formal grammar, and either your data conforms to it or it does not, and if it doesn&#x27;t, good software should simply reject it.<p>Your csvquote is something completely different, though it seems like you yourself might be confused about what it actually is when you use the word &quot;ambiguous&quot;. There is nothing ambiguous about commas and newlines in CSV fields. If it were, that would be a bug in the grammar. It just so happens that many unix shell tools cannot handle CSV files in any meaningful way, because that is not their input grammar. Now, what your csvquote actually does is that it translates between CSV and a format that is compatible with that input grammar on some level, in a reversible manner. The thing to recognize is that that format is _not_ CSV and that you are actually parsing the input according to CSV grammar, so that the translation is actually reversible. Such a conversion between formats is obviously perfectly fine - as long as you can prove that the conversion is reversible, that the round-trip is the identity function, that the processing you do on the converted data is actually isomorphic to what you conceptually want to do, and so on.<p>BTW, I suspect that that code would be quite a bit faster if you didn&#x27;t use a function pointer in that way and/or made the functions static. I haven&#x27;t tried what compilers do with it, but chances are they keep that pointer call in the inner loop, which would be terribly slow. Also, you might want to review your error checking, there are quite a few opportunities for errors to go undetected, thus silently corrupting data.",1401267295

To satisfy himself whether, with our present mechanical knowledge and appliances, more particularly the light motors recently developed, men might reasonably hope eventually to fly through the air.” Chanute wrote that he “now thinks that this question can be answered in the affirmative”<p>“2. To save the waste of effort on the part of experimenters, involved in trying again devices which have already failed.” - and to point out the reasons for such failures<p>“3.

7808956,comment,7777323,7779736,1,0,bdonlan,,,"In clojure cond does not have those extra parenthesis - that&#x27;s a LISPism. cond in clojure works like your example, except that clojure does not have setq.<p>The reason you have those parenthesis on defmacro is that defmacro shares syntax with defn and fn for function declaration; in turn, these allow for multiple side-effecting statements in a function. For example:<p><pre><code>  (defn my-function [args]\n    (prn &quot;Hello, world!&quot;)    ; do something with side effects...\n    args)                    ; then return a value\n</code></pre>\nThis works fine in the single-dispatch case, but when you&#x27;re declaring a function that takes multiple arities (with a different implementation dispatched for each), there&#x27;s no way to tell where each arity ends and the next begins - after all, something like [args] is just data and could easily be a valid expression. The parenthesis are then needed to disambiguate where one arity ends and the next begins:<p><pre><code>  (defn greet\n    ([] (println &quot;Hello, there!&quot;)\n        (swap! greeting-count inc)\n        :greeted)\n    ([name] (println &quot;Hello, &quot; name)\n            (swap! greeting-count inc)\n            :greeted))\n</code></pre>\nThis is a space where clojure seems a bit inconsistent - let, fn, loop, and try all allow multiple expressions, while cond and if don&#x27;t (but you can get it back using the (do) special form). This however does have some logic to it - let and loop get it for free as they don&#x27;t need extra brackets to disambiguate, and for fn it&#x27;s very helpful to be able to just chuck additional statements (debug prints, for example) at the top or bottom without having to wrap in (do). Plus it&#x27;s free in the more-common single arity case, and keeping it around for multiple-arity keeps things internally consistent. On the other hand, if and cond would require disambiguating syntax to take additional statements regardless, and so that syntax might as well be (do).",1401266086

With that will come (disliked and sometimes wrongheaded) regulation, increasing class tension, and perhaps a widespread loss of faith in the current technological leadership.<p>The truth is that most tech companies are horrible. They&#x27;re horrible to their own employees (mean-spirited stack-ranking policies) and horrible to their users and the world outside of them. They&#x27;ve turned the Valley into an Uberized, Snow Crash cesspool.<p>In about 12 months, we&#x27;ve gone from tech exceptionalism (pundits asking why Wall Street talent wasn&#x27;t &quot;doing good for the world&quot; in Silicon Valley) to a full-on hatred of this industry, and it&#x27;s deserved. Rank-and-file programmers who ride Google buses don&#x27;t deserve to be harassed, but the leadership deserves far more hate than it has seen so far.<p>Technology has to make a new choice. Either it changes its leadership wholesale, or Silicon Valley becomes Public Enemy #1. And, unlike Wall Street, it doesn&#x27;t have the collective social skill to still prosper while being hated.",1398088729

Whether it&#x27;s your founder, CEO, HR, or whatever department depending on the size.  Someone is handling this for them, and I guarantee if you don&#x27;t understand it, someone else doesn&#x27;t either.<p>And, if the company hasn&#x27;t made clear the value of what you have, then they aren&#x27;t benefiting from it.

The real problem I think is motivation. Most college students don&#x27;t try that hard in school, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect most people taking online courses (particularly free ones) to try that hard either.<p>If you&#x27;re motivated enough to learn the resources are already available to you.

Apparently early on at LoudCloud (or Opsware) at a company meeting some employees raised the issue that there was too much profanity in the office. Ben acknowledged that he was the worst culprit so this was most likely aimed at him. He slept on it and decided that it could be used but never in a sexist or bullying way. He rationalized it based on the assumption that it was already an inherent part of many tech companies and not allowing it might restrict their access to the best talent. I thought that weird.

I have found it surprisingly unpleasant.<p>When I started, they were just switching from their old site to their new site; in view of this, some issues are to be grudgingly accepted as not unexpected (though I will boldly say that it is not acceptable, and I would not consider it acceptable in a product of my own), and poor support@ response times are in consequence unsurprising also.<p>I was unable to log in for almost a week as their sign up with Google functionality was broken—when I tried to sign up, it complained that I had been invited. When it was <i>finally</i> fixed up, it still didn’t work, for it let me create an account but then not to log in. I got fed up with that and so gained access via “forgot password”. This worked as a temporary workaround. I got my first response back from their support email address after I had resolved it all myself, about a week after the enquiry.<p>Just about every time I log out, my session is dropped, and I need to log in again. If I tell it to “remember me” and then click on “sign in with Google”, then after going through oAuth, it tries to sign <i>up</i> instead, and complains that I already have an account.<p>Keyboard accessibility is dodgy; if you get to any form of entering times afterwards, don’t even bother trying to use the keyboard for navigation. It doesn’t understand most date formats either, and is excessively frustrating about its handling of times, showing no intelligence in AM/PM guessing whatsoever.<p>Bulk editing is very buggy—it normally makes a mess of the day that a task was done on, shifting it to the day before or the day after—and it doesn’t let you work with more than one day’s results at a time, which makes it not very much of a bulk edit. Certain other things in bulk editing are broken also.<p>My boss said to me last week that he was strongly considering replacing Toggl altogether, because it’s just keeping on getting <i>worse</i>, rather than better. (The general opinion around me seems to be that, despite there being certain improvements in the new one, the old one was distinctly better and less buggy.)",1398088353

This is no longer a conspiracy theory, this is real. If you don&#x27;t believe the US government has a hand in manipulating public opinion, then you have to at least believe China and Russia are doing it. While there is not <i>much</i> proof, I think there are probably large corporations attempting to manipulate public opinion through the use of social media. So r/technology banned the word &#x27;tesla&#x27;? Believe it or not the community is probably one of the most influential tech related communities on the internet. How hard would it be to buy a moderators account without anyone knowing? Would paying a hundred grand (or a few hundred) to control one of the most influential tech forums on the internet be worth it? (would it even cost more than a couple thousand dollars?) Could Microsoft or Ford or Daisy make money by manipulating public opinion? You bet they could. Do corporations and government face real threats from large communities getting wind of alternative concepts and ideas through the internet? You bet they do.<p>There is real incentive to control large public internet forums, and when you sit down and think about how you might manipulate a site like reddit the answers are almost obvious. You wouldn&#x27;t even need a moderator account if you had a small team of people with the right technology and incentive. Are the people running r/technology just normal people sitting at home managing one of the biggest forums on the internet while working eight hour days at the salt mine or have they found a way to turn moderating a subreddit with millions of subscribers into a paid gig?<p>So the question is, how do we protect our selves from this type of thing, or at least keep the manipulation out in the open so we can see exactly what&#x27;s happening?",1398088080

To be honest, I feel like &quot;dumb&quot; has helped. I put just enough into state, just enough into events without being super model-oriented. Incidentally, I hear that is why Angular&#x27;s perforance is poor (executes a bunch of js on model behavior even if it only results in 1 render -- not sure if this is true or not but I saw some interesting graphics of browser profiling that showed a ton of methods firing just for 1 small model update).",1398087835

In other words, the features in C++ almost all have direct mappings to how it could be done in C, and going from C to Asm is also quite direct. In contrast, Lisp -> Asm is a <i>huge</i> conceptual leap.<p>I think the much-maligned complexity of C++ is because it grew in this step-by-step fashion and exposes all these levels of abstraction so you can easily reason about the tradeoffs involved and understand the code the machine will eventually be running. More importantly, you don&#x27;t have to use all of them, but this is what makes the language so flexible and accommodating to a wide audience.<p>(Personally I prefer C/Asm more because I don&#x27;t operate at such high abstraction levels often, and when I do, the features of C++ are not a good fit for what I want to accomplish. I have used closures in C and done functional-style there, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like I need to do this often enough to move to C++ or a Lisp.)",1398087826

I wouldn&#x27;t have chosen them otherwise.<p>> Second, instead of allowing sysadmins to find and follow simple, well-researched best-practices, the author instead wants each person to thoroughly research the annals of cryptography in order to then come to their &#x27;own&#x27; conclusion<p>It is up to your own self-conception as a sysadmin as to how deep you want to dive. When interviewing (non-junior grade) sysadmins, I challenge them on security knowledge just as much as other skills. And I know I&#x27;m not alone with that. A certain degree of security awareness is not a &quot;nice to have&quot; typoe additional skill. It&#x27;s vital for everyone that has machines connected to the internet. How far he/she can dive is solely limited by the economics and time constrains. Which is why sensible defaults are needed from vendors and distros (see my other response).<p>> Most sysadmins won&#x27;t do this.<p>Which is a real problem, and again, there should be some effort remedying this, but currently there isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why I plea to sit down and at least learn about the basics. What &quot;the basics&quot; are obviously depends greatly on your educational background, but if AES, RC4 and PFS do not ring a bell, and you are a professional sysadmin who runs SSL-secured web servers, you are not worth your money.<p>> (this why you&#x27;re always told not to roll your own cryptography)<p>Nobody said anything about rolling your own cryptography. But if you at least have read one of Ivan&#x27;s books, you can at least make a /qualified decision/ on how credible a config proposed in a &quot;random blog post&quot; is, without having to come up with the complete solution by yourself.<p>> find the current best practices from a reputable source (like Qualys) and use those.<p>Which is ok -- if you run a small setup and you at least use SSLLabs to verify your setup. The more responsibility you have, and the more security is required, the more you should dive in and have a qualified opinion on how your SSL/TLS setup should look like.",1398087233

Aereo can provide this service for so cheap because it&#x27;s using someone else&#x27;s content for free.

Lawyers and technologists can argue about how Aereo&#x27;s array of individual antennas interacts with the public performance aspects of the Copyright Act, but I think ordinary users wouldn&#x27;t view Aereo as a &quot;cloud computing service&quot; akin to Drop Box, but simply a website where they can stream TV shows for very cheap (ala Hulu).",1398086747

Win7 is an infrequent beloved edition, it would have a long product life cycle. And the N-in-one notion does not have any market attractive factors: If I am using a PC without touchable screen, so how could the Metro&#x27;s cool color squares help me?<p>Now figure out the true advantage of MS they accumulated in past decades. The answer : the programs and games users rely on to live every day,  and the enormous user data, like documents, photos, videos.If you are an elder pc game player, you would know that people always want to play their beloved old games on new windows system. Thousands and thousands hard disks were only sold to stuff with videos and audios.<p>So that is the point: the new mobile system must take advantage of the  programs and files which they already owned on their PC. The good news is: if the mobile and PC system both are marked with widows brand, it would be much easier to connect them together for MS.<p>First create a Resource share center, including PC, phone and pad, to provide a convenient way to access and distribute user&#x27;s photos ,films and so on. Any devices once get the privilege of the share system could freely check the resources in the system ,yet the very data file may locate in another device&#x27;s disk.<p>Try to visualize such scenes: when you must break from watching film on PC - eg. WC - take the phone with you ,and go to the share center ,check the recent play history, click it and continue the viewing experience. Or book : view PDFs on the PC from a pad, and all the bookmarks and reading process are automatically synchronized.And the browser, synchronize opening tabs of different devices. The chrome has provided a solution based on cloud, but it is not quick and robust enough. The solution mainly using LAN of family and work space would be more efficient and economical.<p>Then it is the programs&#x27; turn.Look back to the unbelievable success of the ios app store, the fact is more unbelievable : Why did MS not set up their own software store in the past dacades? There were so many popular programs running on windows, they could be sold with the windows system CD, or even pre-installed in PC, just leaving users the choice option.<p>Now is the time to utilize MS&#x27;s big influence on software market. Ask the public to vote for matches like <the most useful software for you><What is your most expected PC program on mobile>, find the top developers on windows platform.For years most of these creative smart guys have not received reasonable rewards - even nothing at all. Provide them with consistent system environment and develop tools, they might find the old resouce codes in corners of harddisk and reuse them.<p>The further strategy is: encourage PC and mobile work cooperatively.For example, use phone as a controller when PC plays PPT.Let clever developers find more ways, MS&#x27;s work is to prepare robust communicating API. The idea of surface - substitution for both PC and pad - is totally wrong. You should peddle a PC, then a phone, pad in addition, and all run windows on them.<p>So what is your opinion?",1398086243

I know I can isolate them on my home network...</i><p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s actually quite difficult to do that properly with a typical broadband/WiFi box as supplied by most ISPs (at least here in the UK) by default. You need to step up to business-grade gear in most cases, which is both more expensive and beyond the technical knowledge of most consumers, and even then some otherwise respectable devices are regrettably lacking in flexibility when it comes to VLAN configuration and the like. I&#x27;m looking forward to the day when standard home user boxes allow you to do things like isolating certain physical ports or wireless networks by default, so hopefully running untrusted devices on independent networks becomes routine.<p>Even then, there&#x27;s still the problem that if you want to watch some sort of streaming content off the Internet, whichever device(s) have that external connectivity could also pose a privacy risk if they have access to whichever devices are acting as home media servers. DLNA seems like a step in the right direction for connecting up home media devices, but I haven&#x27;t seen much evidence of a robust security model being implemented so far.",1398085854

Typically people who react in the affirmative that there is a problem are being dismissed as neo luddites. Everyone who read Ford's book knows that it's not that easy.<p>Even if this book is wrong, and I haven't found any good rebuttals, it's important that as many smart people and current and future employers are aware of the line of argument so that they can add the effect to their thinking patterns.",1313848712
2906642,comment,2906455,2906455,2,0,coenhyde,,,"Possibly but economic collapse might be necessary to rebalance our economy and society to accommodate the newly freed labor. The labor force freed up from factory work needs to be redistributed to some other industry; not necessarily directly. We still educate people to be human robots but now we have real robots so we don't need people for factory work anymore. What we need are innovative and creative people for the cultural revolution. Ideally it would be nice if this transition didn't require economic collapse but our society is reactive not proactive.",1313848667

I'm not too up on  slang so I don't believe that means anything else other than ""giving someone a fat lip"" when you hit them.  It also works for you because I think what you're getting at is the moles have thick lips. Not sure though.<p>For ""Americanizing"" it, you're probably going to have to play with the mechanics/sound effects/art.  Wack-a-mole is nothing new; you may have to spice it up with something like bowling pins or baseball bats or chainsaws or ACME anvils or ??? (if you want to keep the melee aspect). I suspect that will keep people playing.<p>It's like the shooting fishing game that was featured a while back.  Fishing games that drop a line is nothing new, but shooting the fish afterwards is novel enough that people will pay for it.",1313848665

2906635,comment,2906538,2906547,41,0,bhousel,,,"The author is exactly right.  There's no way that a tree array of panels that are half not even pointing at the sun will outperform a linear array of panels that are mostly pointing at the sun.  Panels efficiency is measured in Watts, and this kid is not going to be able to record their efficiency with a simple probe DMM.  In order to get a full picture of what's going on with his arrays, he would need to hook both arrays up to a load and measure throughout the day, or better yet a battery array / charge controller and measure at the end of the day which array produced more power.<p>I kind of wanted to say something yesterday, but really didn't want to pile on the kid, and everyone here just wanted so badly for the kid to be a genius.  The few comments that pointed out that he was wrong were voted down.<p>This is something that really bothers me about science fairs.  Back when I was 13 years old, I did a school project to redesign a local troublesome intersection.  I just made a model of what it might look like and people loved it and they even wrote about it in the paper and displayed my model in the municipal building, and talked about what a bright young kid I was.<p>Now that I'm older, this bothers me a lot because in doing the project I didn't do any real research, I didn't talk to any traffic engineers, I didn't learn about intersection designs.. I didn't learn anything really.  As an adult, I can see that my plan for the intersection was silly and unworkable.<p>I kind of wish that schools emphasized mentorship programs rather than science fairs.  Kids would learn far more by partnering with knowledgeable adults to do their experiments, rather than having these silly competitions where nobody learns anything and the winner is the kid who puts the most work into having the nicest presentation.",1313848398

That would allow us to associate clicking an icon with action that brings up a search input.<p>Or hey... have the search dialog always open. Many users (most?) at least understand the notion of internet search, and it's helped a lot that there's an internet search box at the top of all major browsers for the past several years.<p>Adding a default 'page search' box that's open all the time would be a big signal to users that this functionality even exists in the first place.<p>I'd say the same thing for privacy - screw 3 levels of SSL certificate hell and warning - give everyone a little cookie icon that shows, in nice easy language, the sites tracking you and the data they have stored in your cookies, and give an easy way - from the main browser screen - to <i>poof</i> them away.

2906626,comment,2906434,2906434,17,0,cookiecaper,,,"The proposition that ""real names"" significantly enhances a user experience is a bit silly, I think. It may contribute in some small way as far as what you're willing to admit, but generally it doesn't seem to change behavior a lot.<p>The quality of commentary on a public comment platform has much more to do with a given community's moderation and social mechanisms than the username that appears above the comment. YouTube is a mess because it's a hit-and-run system, there is no social obligation, you just type what you think about the video and never look at it again. Additionally, YouTube has a short length limit on comments precluding in-depth discussions, and YouTube's audience is very varied and primarily non-specialized.<p>There are many public messaging systems online that have flourished and maintain a high level of quality even though they allow pseudonyms. Hacker News, for instance. I can think of five or six high-quality messaging systems  wherein I have actively participated off the top of my head that were not flooded with YouTube-esque idiocy -- the name policy really has very little to do with it, I think.<p>Google+ is completely controlled by its users; you must explicitly accept any author's content that you wish to view and you can block and explicitly reject any author's content that rubs you the wrong way. It is a fundamentally different model than YouTube. In this case, people are generally only going to accept you into their circles if they know who you are at least vaguely, whether the displayed name is ""cookiecaper"" or ""Jeff Cook"". I just don't see the point in even having the argument regarding Google+ when it has to be explicitly regulated by the user anyway. Facebook likewise.<p>I think the real motivation here on the part of both Google and Facebook is to discourage the use of multiple identities so that it's easier to target advertising.<p>Pseudonymity is still possible, though, so I'm still not sure why this is such a major deal, because you can just go create a Google Account with whatever plausible name you can dream up. You can then reveal your identity to the persons you'd like and everyone else knows you as generic John Smith. In fact, I do this on Facebook, and I presume that many others with an interest in pseudonymity do so as well.",1313848113

2906622,comment,2905419,2906358,2,0,ansy,,,"SMS is arguably less secure than email over an SSL connection. Why would you even consider sending credit card details over SMS? Not only can SMS messages be sniffed and you have no idea if carriers are encrypting it or unencrypting it, but your SMS messages are stored unprotected on both the sending and receiving phones. These could get lost, stolen, or hacked. News Corp cell phone hacking scandal? Celebrity cell phone hackig scandals? If you have an smart phone and sync back up to a computer it copies over your SMS history in plain text. If a police officer pulls you over he has a device that can copy over the entire contents of your cell phone. Common criminals or anyone else aren't far behind.<p>The best way to exchange credit card information safely is when every step is certified to be PCI compliant which has very strict rules for how credit card information is transmitted, handled, and stored and who can handle them.<p>I would sooner speak my credit card number to a trusted vendor's call center employee than SMS it anywhere.

More locked down than Android, less locked down than iOS.  Like Android, WP7 is currently distributed by OEMs, independently from Microsoft.  But the licensing agreement for those OEMs is much tighter than it is for Android.  Like iOS, Microsoft has an established entertainment distribution channel centered around XBox Live and the Zune technology.  Even if they think Android is an easier target, I guarantee you they consider Apple a competitor.<p>In any case, I don't see why you think OEMs are particularly dependent on Google.  Google has no direct control over Android -- it's just that Google's fork of the Android source code is the most popular with OEMs for the time being.  There is nothing stopping OEMs from building their own CyanogenMod-type customizations (after all, Samsung just hired the creator of this ROM) or even forking Android entirely as apparently some Chinese OEMs are doing: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/07/androids-ascent-in-china-is-not-elevating-google.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/07/androids-ascent-...</a>.

The start of the war, the conduct of the war, and the conclusion of the war were all disasters, killing millions, destroying millions of people's lives, and finally delivering millions into the clutches of totalitarianism.<p>No, no one sane would advocate for another WWII.<p>However, a nation that implodes is also incredibly unpleasant. The most well-known is going from Rome to the Dark Ages. This path should also be avoided.<p>Re: resource scarcity, it's counter-mainstream but I'm not sure that's correct... net actionable resources might even be increasing - see, ex, all the energy that can now be gotten out of thorium. If you're a believer in cold fusion being possible (hot fusion already is possible, but isn't economical) then fossil fuels are basically a non-issue. But that's a long conversation. Suffice to say, I think the Earth can prosperously contain many more people than today, and that if it did so, it would be more prosperous. Much moreso, actually, since all gain comes from talented people and groups doing interesting things. But that's a long conversation.<p>Anyways. My argument is ""completely pacifist societies seem to self-destruct"" - there are a few rare exceptions that are extremely mountainous or islands or mountainous islands.

It sounds like you're explaining iCloud in excessive detail to someone who has no use for it and doesn't understand the concept of syncing at all. Someone used to iTunes is not going to be that confused when things that used to require a physical sync can now happen automatically without one.<p>Many things are transparent to the user, too. For instance, Apple has always had ""backups"" of your purchases. All they've done here is enable you to download them instead of restoring from your own copy. You don't have to learn or understand anything new for that to be useful.",1307393990

It's really modular; the spree gem is actually a meta-gem with deps pointing to other gems, 'spree-core', 'spree-auth', 'spree-promo' etc.<p>You make all your customisations to it in the same way, by decorating the various core classes, following the same pattern as the spree submodules themselves.<p>Oh and it has shitloads of tests, both rspec and cucumber/capybara.<p>Basically it seems pretty sweet.",1307393919

In Android, the intent system (and back button) make it very easy to switch between apps. On iOS, apps use APIs instead. Integrated Web views rather than opening a browser. Mail API rather than switching to the mail client. This keynote we just saw that Apple has done this again, adding a Twitter API to iOS 5.<p>It's quite an interesting and significant difference between the two mobile operating systems. Android's approach encourages openness, Apple's approach gives them complete control over the UX. Neither is inherently bad.",1307393862

The music companies have argued in the past that I didn't get a license to convert my audio into digital form (aka rip an MP3) when I bought my CDs. So your postulate that 'you already have a license' would not be valid to a company that held I didn't get any rights other than the court stipulated 'archive copy'.<p>Anyway, I don't know one way or the other. But I have seen other companies take a similar approach unsuccessfully, and its interesting to see how Apple is moving the conversation about digital media along.<p>Since it would be possible to keep a non-DRM copy in perpetuity on disk, I'm really curious about how this will implement.

Or 2) they can attempt to detect that it's pirated and block it somehow and I'm guessing that you get a
fairly shitty user experience when that happens.   I'm also going to go ahead and guess that many of the MP3s you've ripped over the last
decade may also ""fail"" the test and be thought of as pirated.<p>On the other side,  what's it harm?  You're providing the media, they are just saving you the steps of uploading it.  Now where you'd game
the system is if you had like 16kbit versions of some tracks and they upgrade them for you.  If that works then there is kind of a new
avenue in piracy they may be opening up,  you download small lo-fi versions quickly and then iTunes could fix them up for you...   They

""owns"" which tracks (that alone combined with iTunes buying patterns and some listening patterns potentialy gives you a huge clue in to who
are the pirates) who plays what, when,  where?   Seems like some really really killer social apps could be built ontop of this as well

Pay us $25 and we'll trade your crappy-quality MP3s for 256k AACs.""<p>2. I don't think they're giving you a license.  You're supposed to already have a license for the song you already have.  Apple is merely replacing a likely lower-quality copy with a higher-quality copy.<p>3. Doubtful (to the point that I almost said no).  You aren't going to get immunity from prosecution, but I'm guessing that Apple isn't going to try too hard to find people that have pirated their collection and I think the music industry knows that.  It isn't Apple's style (there's no product key on their OS, no activation on their products, etc.).  They might do something that tries to figure out if it was a legitimately acquired track, but maybe they'll just go the ""we can't match that track"" route if it's flagged.  Just like #2, you're going to be in the same license and legality position that you were in before.<p>This is a convenience measure - for you and Apple.  For you, this syncs your music between all your computers/devices.  For Apple, if they can match the tracks, they don't have to store all the extra tracks as duplicates on their storage.  A syncing service wouldn't be useful to you if it only dealt with the music you bought from Apple.  They know that it's only useful if it does all your music and so they created a matching service to be bandwidth, time and space efficient.  The service costs money to create and run and so they're charging a small fee for it.  It's highly doubtful that it will change anything on the legal end.",1307391853

From one app you can jump into another app while opening a specific screen. Android apps have a functional back-button that works by default (as in, the developer doesn't have to do anything to benefit from it). Android apps are very composable as normally they expose APIs that can be used by other apps (the environment encourages it by means of intents, services, broadcast receivers and the multiple entry points I mentioned above). Android apps give the impression of being always on, since you can't rely on an app to stay alive you have to implement life-cycle management (e.g. save the user's data and the app's state as soon as you can).<p>What I describe above is by no means unique to Android apps (iOS apps are usually as well behaved, or even more so), but Android makes it natural.

2626352,comment,2625967,2626100,6,0,mdasen,,,"It isn't a subscription to your music, it's a subscription to the matching service.  The point of iCloud is that they'll sync all of your music that you've bought from iTunes to all your devices.  No more connecting your iPhone to your computer or managing the 2 computers you have with iTunes and how they get copied and such.  Now, for music that you've ripped or bought from other sources, Apple is offering a matching service.  Basically, it'll look through your collection and if they're in iTunes Apple will note that you already own those songs and allow you to also sync those songs via the new iCloud sync mechanism.<p>So, the tracks don't expire and you'll always have them.  It's unclear if the subscription is for the syncing and the matching or just the matching.  If it's just the matching, you can basically import your old music into your iTunes purchases and then not have to continue paying for it (assuming that you don't get new music outside the iTunes Store).  The subscription also seems to cover syncing music that isn't in iTunes via uploading your MP3s.<p>So, it isn't a music subscription as much as it is a service/convenience subscription.",1307391018

Home button, app shortcut. In my experience, the android way addresses the more common scenario.<p>Also, there are builds of android (HTC's Sense UI, I believe) that do have notifications on the lock screen. Not only that, but the lock screen is configurable, so you can add shortcuts that, when you drag them to the unlock field, take you directly to the app. This is a neat feature that I hope eventually makes it into android proper.<p>EDIT: Hm, this is factual and fairly uncontroversial.

Android is fine if you want to choose from 1% of the number of apps available for iPhone.<p>A friend of mine designs phones for Motorola.  He's angry as hell about the Android ecosystem b/c he knows there is some great hardware being built, but it's compromised by greedy companies that ship the phone with a 2 hour battery, etc.  Android is full of this sort of short-term thinking.<p>These are all more salient features than the few areas where Android is actually better (google apps integration, turn by turn navigation).<p>The notification feature isn't all that necessary.  I turned off all notifications on my iPhone and haven't missed anything.  Most of the notifications generated by Android apps are equally useless.  It's as if we're arguing about the color of Microsoft Bob's glasses.<p>In terms of the overall customer experience, usability, and app ecosystem, IOS is several years ahead of Android. I say this as someone who got two Android phones free at Google IO last year and still switched to an iPhone 4.  It's not about checking off a box on a feature checklist, it's about the quality of the experience of using the features.",1307390443

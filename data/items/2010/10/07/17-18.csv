In the case of the dropped packet, once it is retransmitted the partition is healed and progress can be made.  Or in the case of the failed node, nothing says that the <i>rest</i> of the system can't be consistent and available, so that the system as a whole maintains that property.

Or, it may return failure, but the package actually installed successfully.<p>News to me.  Should I just take your word for it?<p>> There had been a bug about it in the FreeBSD tracker about it for a couple of years when I ran into it...I don't know if it's been fixed by now. This was during the 7.0 release cycle.<p>Do you have a link to that?<p>Anyway, bugs happen.  For instance, some RPM signing functionality is broken [1].  There's also the fact that killing a simple yum info command can leave the rpmdb in an inconsistent state [2] -- and I'd call that a ""really scary quirk"" if it wasn't just a bug.  Should I claim these are some kind of inherent failings of RPMs compared to FreeBSD ports, the way you claimed a bug was some kind of inherent failing of the FreeBSD ports system?<p>> I've already mentioned the dependency issues I've run into.<p>I've run into dependency issues with DEB and RPM based tools, too.<p>> And, at the end of it all, the user can run ""apt-get update; apt-get upgrade"" and our packages get updated along with everything else.<p>I asked around.  It is absolutely possible to set up a third-party repository for FreeBSD ports.  If you want to, you can even set up a second, completely separate ports tree, and a handful of lines of sh script can be used to as a wrapper around your ports management tool of choice to automate the process of selecting a ports tree from which to get what you need to manage a particular port if it isn't in the default tree -- if that's the route you want to take.  I poked around in manpages for about three minutes before coming up with the basics for such a system, then decided before putting more effort into it to ask on the freebsd-questions list whether a third-party ports source could be used with standard ports management tools; the first response gave me an idea how to do this, and it pointed to exactly the sort of thing I had found in my manpage browsing.<p>Hire someone who uses (and likes) FreeBSD if you're having that much trouble finding what took me about three minutes to find.<p>> And, we have a nice UI in the product itself that can query the native package manager to display a list of available updates and such.<p>Getting that information out of the ports tree is trivial.<p>> I found pkg_info during my Trail of FreeBSD Tears, but I don't believe it tells you about the configuration of the installed port, does it? I don't remember exactly what information I needed and couldn't get, as it's been a couple of years since I was banging on it seriously, but I do recall there were details I couldn't get making it difficult to figure out the actual state of the system.<p>Well, sorry -- I can't tell you how to find something if you don't know what you need to find.  I suspect it's there to be found, though, if it's not completely unreasonable.<p>> I hate our current distribution and installation process on FreeBSD, and having the ability to use native packages with native update mechanisms would be great.<p>I'd recommend starting with references to environment variables in the pkgtools.conf file if you want to get where I was going in short order.  You can also get some hints from this response to my freebsd-questions query [3].  He talked a little more about mirroring than I had intended with my question, but a lot of the information is very generalizable.<p>> I want less. I want One True Package Manager on the system and I want it to be able to manage and update all the packages. Adding more software to an already large stack is exactly the opposite of what I want to do.<p>Admirable.<p>> yum/rpm makes this trivially easy. apt-get makes it reasonably easy. FreeBSD makes it pretty much impossible as far as I can tell. But, hey, if you get it figured out, I'd be more than happy to be wrong. Supporting FreeBSD has been a pain in my ass for years now, and it'll continue to be so as long as installation is such a mess.<p>If you're still having problems with this a year from now, you could always check back with me and see if my curiosity has driven me to look into it enough to write up a howto (or to find and test any that might have been written by others, since that would probably be preferable to duplicating effort).<p>> our FreeBSD users tend to be better educated about their systems than our CentOS users, on average; which makes sense, given that CentOS is the ""standard"" in hosting, and you'd have to go seek out FreeBSD<p>Have you considered throwing the question to your FreeBSD users to see if they can offer any help or suggestions to make things easier for themselves?<p>---<p>edit:<p>I don't know how long I'll be able to keep up with this discussion here.

The goal is NOT to watch recent movies but to build yourself a solid cinematographic culture (not sure that's correct English but I'm sure you get what I'm saying).<p>We'll definitely add affiliate links.

If people pay in advance, you charge (number of houses / cost of maintenance).  Very straightforward.

But you don't know in advance how many houses will burn down.<p>Finally, while letting a house burn down is an ugly business, it's also pretty ugly when you have to send out collections.

What the author did not explain is that some DNS servers can preemptively send the reply to the CNAME target along with the result, avoiding that extra round trip. You can see this for example with www.google.com. However, Google returns only one CNAME (www.l.google.com.) and it does not seem to vary over time or location. My sample size is admittedly quite small. On the other hand, one could just as easily skip the CNAME altogether and return only as many A records as will fit into a packet.<p>The GeoDNS section didn't even attempt to link the feature to the article's subject.

Here's a few pointers from my experience.<p>1. Remember the show airs in Chicago in the morning, then more than once across time zones, so this will be an all day treat. We had a lot of buzz (Oprah's own forums went down under load for our show), and our URL was displayed on the screen. Regardless, you can expect a lot of traffic, mostly during the show and a few days afterward.<p>2. Your db will likely be your bottleneck. Make sure you don't have any unoptimized queries, or better yet, cache as much as you can so you're only hitting the db on writes for all the orders you'll be getting.<p>3. If possible, offload static content to a cdn. Akamai saved us here, because the site was not optimized size-wise.<p>4. What ultimately caused us issues was slow clients. I would definitely try to have a caching proxy up front. The snowball effect would cause us to tap out our 100Mb connection at times. Since you're using cloud hosting hopefully that's not a hard limitation for you.<p>5. It's <i>really</i> fun watching your bandwidth. I used a console tool called bmon. You'll be able to tell when commercials happen during the show.<p>6. +1 for a backup plan. Have a static page ready that you can switch over to. I'd highly suggest having an alternate payment processor, even if you have to go with Paypal. Since you're SAAS, you can't rely on retail or Amazon, so you may not get visitors to come back if your site fails. Make sure you can capture those customers the first time.<p>7. If you don't plan on having a free account, offer something so you can build your customer list and capture contact info. A whitepaper, newsletter, etc.<p>Have fun!",1286472436

The games that Zynga are designing are pretty much bankrupt in terms of enjoyment in and of itself. They're a Korean MMO grind, with the key difference that you have to force your friends into that grind, or pay up.<p>I really did enjoy Frontierville for the first week or so. There was something therapeutic about tending to my farm, hitting snakes, adding some new trinkets. It's the same pleasure centers as Animal Crossing hits. Then I need to build a building, which requires all sorts of tools, which you can either buy with real money, or get from friends. Those took a couple of days to acquire from my friends.

My choice was ""Pay up, spam more friends, or I dare you to quit."" I quit.<p>Does it matter that a game designer I greatly admire was putting me in this ridiculous situation in his game? Actually, yes it does. It makes it burn <i>more</i> when a man I respect is telling the press how great Zynga is and how much freedom he has, and then he's producing games like this. It's hard not to feel he's simply happy cashing pay checks, players be damned.<p>I'm not adverse to the idea of paying for games that are Freemium, I put a decent amount of money into Free Realms. But FR was careful to make the transactions in there not required: much of the game (apart from some jobs) was available to you, and that game design didn't require a microtransaction sword or whatever to progress. No money was required, which is the difference with Zynga's games.<p>Facebook games are a great new place to be. I have no chip about Zynga's Scrooge McDuck money bins, and respect them for their success, the metrics-based technology they have at the backend, and the amazing team they've managed to put together.

Mind, there are ways people can be compelled to pay, within various limits.<p>Some search-and-rescue services (I believe in Norway, for one set of examples) have a nominal, voluntary fee that hikers and skiers can opt to pay or not.  If payers need rescue, they don't have to pay anything beyond that original fee.  If non-payers get rescued, they get a big bill for search helicopter fuel, labor, etc. spent in looking for them.<p>Something like that seems sensible to me - if the guy had said, ""Yes, please put out my house, I'm aware you'll bill me,"", maybe signing a waiver or whatever to prevent problems with the firefighters' insurance company, then the firefighters could try to save his house and then the city could bill him, then sue him or garnish his wages, etc. if he refused to pay.",1286471014

For most places, firefighting is a part of taxation. These people have $75 less in taxes, and $75 more as a ""optional"" insurance policy.<p>And to all the people saying ""Well pay them when they show up"", do you drive around without insurance until you crash, and then go to an insurance company with your monthly payment in hand and say ""Pretend I've been paying this all along, now go fix my car""? Do you skimp on health insurance payments until you're in the hospital and expect to only have to pay the cost of a month's worth of health insurance?

I showed it to a lot of people at TechCrunch Disrupt and they loved it. With some connections from Google Ventures, I'm able to get local fax numbers on demand, API access and wholesale rates.  Normally you have to be a high volume company to get the rates and access that I'm getting.<p>So, what's left until paid launch:\n1. Final setup of the Asterisk Fax Server\n2. Completion of editor and signature tool (it's 75 percent done, not yet visible on the domain)\n3. Billing system<p>It's a cash product. No pie in the sky here.<p>I'm hoping to find a developer in the Bay Area to help me out.

Some ezines seem to struggle along with a few mailing lists, but that&#x27;s it. Most active members in these &quot;underground&quot; cultures(e.g. demoscene and vx scene) are old ones from the dawn of time, some newbies come and go but hardly any stick. These communities have been shrinking for the past 15 years or so.<p>Or am I really missing something? I really think there was so much more low-hanging fruit to grab back in late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s and the computing culture back then thrived around doing just that.

Was a flimsy fingerprint reader really supposed to be the killer app of the iPhone 5s? Jesus.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of things that would blow everyone else away:<p>1) NFC realized from the ground up. It absolutely will be a must have in the very near future, and I won&#x27;t be stuck with a phone that doesn&#x27;t have it.<p>2) An enormous innovation in battery tech. I want you to figure out a way to make my battery last 2-4 days on a charge.<p>3) Some sort of major design innovation. Edge-to-edge screen? That would look incredible; so novel, it&#x27;d be impossible to ignore.<p>4) A software-level overhaul of what it means to have a device on you that is capable of being constantly connected to the internet. It can be an ecosystem (we already know apple is good at building those), or something similar, but the future is one where you don&#x27;t have to check your phone for anything.

We could get by with once a day call auctions or even trading stocks face-to-face without an exchange at all. We don&#x27;t even <i>need</i> stocks or companies. That doesn&#x27;t mean intermediation in real-time markets isn&#x27;t valuable.<p>Say you have a car and want to sell it to buy your future wife an engagement ring. You could take it to CarMax and sell it instantly, or spend your time researching a fair price, posting up ads, cleaning it up for sale, meeting with potential buyers, etc. CarMax has all sorts of &quot;unfair&quot; advantages: they&#x27;ve developed superior pricing models, they have access to historical auction data you may not be able to get, they can sell their inventory in the inter-dealer auction market, they&#x27;ve invested heavily in their own sales force to resell the car, through economies of scale they can hire their own detailers and mechanics to fix the cars up at a lower price, etc. CarMax is clearly superior to you at the &quot;reselling used cars&quot; game, though all the advantages they have are things any competitor could choose to purchase. They make money doing this, but people still choose to deal with them because it&#x27;s a net benefit to be able to sell your car instantly.<p>Some people prefer to sell their car to CarMax, others try their hand at doing it themselves, and through their patience they may save a bit of money. Likewise you can do the same in the financial markets. You can work your own limit orders to enter or exit positions or trade in the opening/closing call auctions on each exchange, but many traders prefer to trade instantly with quotes placed by a market maker. Being able to liquidate your stock holdings to spend the money on something else instantly is valuable to some people, and they pay for it through the bid-ask spread.<p>You&#x27;re basically saying people want the wrong things.",1396889865

7547695,comment,7545364,7546348,1,0,bashcoder,,,"> How does this work as the network scales? If I understand it correctly, every node needs to execute every contract.<p>Such a network can grow to some extent, but how can it truly scale? There is limited scaling, of course, but node requirements increase as traffic increases, and there is no scalability through distribution of computational resources. So the more work the system does, the stronger each node needs to be.<p>If the answer to this is, &quot;No problem - we&#x27;ll just make it more expensive,&quot; then the required computational resources could be purchased with the very cryptocurrency that is generated from the system. At that point, it seems to me that the snake eats its own tail.<p>Regardless, before we declare that there can be any democratization enabled by this tech, I think we need to ask the question, &quot;How does this not transfer even more power to those with the most computational power?&quot;<p>Put another way, it seems this is tailor-made for Google and Amazon, not an organization of Joe Publics, each with a couple extra GPU&#x27;s installed. It&#x27;s still going to be about the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m happy to be proven wrong on any of these thoughts.

7547670,comment,7545319,7545319,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"I don&#x27;t think this quite hits the nail on the head. Perhaps hacker communities haven&#x27;t grown, but I think the reasons given are a bit too abstract. In my opinion, there are two main factors at play here. One is that many of the late 90&#x27;s early 2000&#x27;s hackers went corporate for the $$, or worse, went government. I&#x27;ll never forget calling Mudge up and asking him how DARPA was treating him, and he was loving it simply because of all the cool things he was seeing.<p>For quite a while I think the hacker community was much more about hobby and IT professionals who were curious (sysadmins breaking out of the box), whereas now people just want to break into stuff and get paid big bucks (banks seem to be the centerpiece of the pen-testing economy to me). I interviewed at a local security company, and when I started talking about evil-maid attacks, I got blank stares back. So what really ended up happening is that guys starting realizing they could just run scans and produce fancy reports and get paid lots of money, and they got lazy and stopped contributing to the community as much.<p>Secondly though, is the chilling effect. I have been ranting about NSA for at least a decade, but we didn&#x27;t have much proof beyond the Echelon/Tempest leaks. Now we know how pervasive it really is and that it&#x27;s still probably even worse than we thought, and people are starting to realize that we only temporarily won the 90&#x27;s crypto wars.<p>Eben Moglen said about the cryptowars: &quot;in 95 at Harvard, Stuart Baker (former NSA General Counsel), after a debate about the right to encrypt, said, &quot;...public key encryption will become available. We fought a long losing battle against it, but it was just a delaying tactic...&quot;<p>I spent some time at unallocated space, which is the closest big hacker lab to NSA headquarters, and it was sorta hush-hush that we just don&#x27;t talk about NSA stuff while there. Great guys, all around, but I feel like too many hackers got mired in the technical and forgot about the political side of things.<p>We have to realize that what is going on is a massive control power play being put into action. Surveillance of the level that is happening isn&#x27;t about security at all. It&#x27;s about control. I&#x27;m willing to bet that in the next few months we are about to see some COINTELPRO level releases from Greenwald and team. Hack all you want, and maybe even get hired by some contractor to make lots of money... but if you dare start applying those skills to politics... you better watch out because you just went to the top of a list somewhere.<p>I have put it like this, if data = information, and information = power, then secret data = secret information = secret power. Hackers are a threat to those who wield secret data, and their communities are heavily targeted for infiltration and worse. This to me, is much more influential on the hacker community than some imaged lack of creativity. I think the creativity is there, but people are having to hide it away.",1396889589

You can use O_DIRECT very easily without a lot of overhead if you wish but the performance will be much worse than not using it unless you competently reimplement many other parts of the OS functionality at the same time.<p>To use O_DIRECT effectively in Linux, at a minimum you need to write a buffer cache that is both fast and adaptive to workloads with proper cache replacement schedulers (no LRU crap), you need to write a complete I/O scheduler replacement (e.g. using io_submit and related interfaces) which is not portable at all, and you need to stop using almost all file system APIs (it interferes with the I/O scheduling bypass).<p>O_DIRECT is easy to use for very narrow cases.

I&#x27;d be happy to respond to questions here.<p>Dear Modern Microcredit,<p>I&#x27;m sorry that you found our website information misleading.  I&#x27;d like to address your points here:<p>1. Interest rate diagram: As we do apply a 5% transaction fee, I agree that the diagram showing a range of 0% to 15% is incorrect.  A volunteer had donated the diagram to us years ago, and we did not scrutinize it sufficiently before using it in our website.  We have now removed the diagram until it can be adjusted to reflect the 5% minimum cost.<p>2. Registration Fee: This is approximately $12 paid when a borrower first joins Zidisha, and provides lifetime membership.  We do not include it in the interest cost calculation because it covers the unlimited number of loans that borrower may receive over the course of many years.<p>3.  Zidisha service fee: This is a flat 5% of the loan amount per year the loan is held.  Most Zidisha loans are held for less than a year, so it is usually less than 5% of the loan amount.  For example, the 5% fee for $50 loan held for three months would be 1.25%, or about 63 cents.  That is hardly exorbitant.<p>4.  Interest offered to lenders: We allow borrowers to offer any interest rate they choose to lenders, from 0% up to a maximum of 25% of the value of the loan per year the loan is held.  In practice, the highest rates are usually offered by first-time borrowers who have not yet established track records with Zidisha (much as new eBay sellers offer the first few items at a discount).<p>5.  Using a collection of randomly selected loans as a proxy for average cost to Zidisha borrowers is misleading.  First-time Zidisha loans are overrepresented in this measure, because they are smaller and repaid more quickly, and are therefore more numerous than the larger subsequent loans taken by established borrowers.  Since first-time loans pay the highest annualized interest (because they are held for a short time), using them as an example overstates the average cost of Zidisha loans.  Our statistics correct for this by using a weighted average based on dollar amounts rather than single loans.<p>6.  We use flat rates not in order to deceive, but simply because they are more intuitive to borrowers and lenders than APR.  The vast majority of our borrowers are used to flat rates being quoted by local lenders, and when they tell us they want to borrow $100 at 10% interest, they mean that they wish to repay $110.  If we wanted to distort our data to appeal to lenders, it would make more sense to use APR, as the higher quoted rates would make lending through Zidisha seem more profitable.  In fact, our intent is simply to make the cost easy to understand for everyone.  For extra clarity, we provide extensive explanation of APR vs. flat rates, and display the exact dollar amounts borrowers pay for each loan in the loan profile pages.  I don&#x27;t see how this can be construed as hiding information. Using APR in Zidisha&#x27;s situation would mean sacrificing a measure that the majority of our members understand easily for theoretical precision.<p>7.  You imply that Zidisha does not in fact lower the cost of microloans in developing countries.  That is not true.  Even the $50 loan you cited above, which chose to offer to lenders the maximum interest rate we allow at Zidisha, ended up costing the borrower only $1.73 in interest and fees.  I would be surprised if any other lender would offer an online applicant with no credit history a short-term loan at such rates.<p>Zidisha&#x27;s cost savings to borrowers have been independently analyzed.  Below is an excerpt from a study published by microfinance analyst Daniel Rozas. (Note that the average interest borrowers have opted to pay lenders has increased from 2-3% at the time of this study to about 5-6% currently, but this does not invalidate the conclusion that Zidisha&#x27;s rates are substantially lower than what has hitherto been available.)<p>Zidishaâs interest rates are remarkably low, ranging between 7-8% annually (quoted flat), of which 2-3% is charged by lenders and 5% is levied by Zidisha to fund its operations. An additional fee of some $10-20 is charged for initial registration (but not for subsequent loans). This is far below the local prevailing rates â MFTransparency places similarly-sized loans (50,000 KES) at about 35% APR (Zidishaâs loans are 15-18% APR). And itâs all the more noteworthy, considering that Zidishaâs borrowers are largely in rural areas, where credit tends to be more expensive. The key to the low rates rests on Zidishaâs avoidance of costly staff and operations on the ground, and its ability to leverage low-cost funds from socially-motivated lenders.

Doing hard things in R can be very hard, but the easy things are easy.  Eg loading a csv full of data and running a regression on it are two lines of code that are pretty easy to explain to people:<p><pre><code>   $ R\n   data <- read.csv(file=&#x27;some_file&#x27;, header=T, sep=&#x27;,&#x27;)\n   model <- lm(Y ~ COL1 + COL2 + COL3, data=data)\n</code></pre>\nand if you want to use glm -- logistic regression, etc -- it&#x27;s a trivial change:<p><pre><code>   model <- glm(Y ~ COL1 + COL2 + COL3, family=binomial, data=data)\n</code></pre>\nIt really allows people to do quite powerful statistical analyses very simply.  Note that they built a dsl for specifying regression equations -- and you don&#x27;t have to bother with bullshit like quoting column column names; quoting requirements are often hard to explain to new computer users.<p>R&#x27;s other key feature is it includes a full sql-like data manipulation language to manipulate tabular data; it&#x27;s so good that every other language that does stats copied it.  If df is a dataframe, I can issue predicates on the rows before the comma and columns after the comma, eg<p><pre><code>   df[ df$col1 < 3 & df$col2 > 7, &#x27;col4&#x27;]\n</code></pre>\nthat takes my dataframe and subsets it so -- row predicates before the comma -- col1 is less than 3 and col2 is greater than 7 -- and column predicates after the comma -- just returns a new dataframe from the subset with col4 in it.

Therefore, even if proprietary exchange data products are expensive, they are equally expensive to all participants. I consider that fair.<p>An argument could be made that the price of the feeds is exclusionary. I do not buy this - there are many types of data available in the market that come at a high price. The next question (if you assume that the price makes it effectively non-public) is if there are effective substitutes. I think for non-professional traders (moving less than, say, $10mm notional per month) the SIP and similar feeds is acceptable (just as many retail traders accept 15min delayed market data as acceptable). For more serious traders, there may not be an acceptable substitute, but given their usage the higher costs are more justified.<p>* Ethical rules around front running of orders is covered in the Manning Rule.

In this case X is the data to be split, INDEX is the identifier, and FUN is the function.  There are some limitations, including X must be a vector.<p>a code example:<p><pre><code>   > df <- data.frame(id=c(&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;), vals=rnorm(5,10))\n   > df\n     id     vals\n   1  a 10.86507\n   2  a 10.71303\n   3  a 11.15321\n   4  b 10.78187\n   5  b 10.80042\n   \n   > # calculate a mean on vals grouped by id\n   > tapply(df$vals, df$id, mean)\n          a        b \n   10.91044 10.79114\n   > # similarly a median -- both mean and median are built in functions \n   > tapply(df$vals, df$id, median)\n          a        b \n   10.86507 10.79114 \n   > \n   > # now let&#x27;s build our own function; I&#x27;m going to build a function that drops outliers\n   > f <- function(xs){ qs <- quantile(xs, probs=c(0.025, 0.975)); mean( xs[xs >= qs[1] & xs <= qs[2]])}\n   > tapply(df$vals, df$id, f)\n          a        b \n   10.86507      NaN \n   > \n   > # well, this is just a demo and we ran out of bs, so it got NaN, but you see the idea\n   >\n   > # and plyr\n   > library(plyr)\n   > f2 <- function(dfs){ qs <- quantile(dfs$vals, probs=c(0.025, 0.975)); mean(dfs[ dfs$val >= qs[1] & dfs$val <= qs[2], &#x27;vals&#x27;])}\n   > ddply(df, .(id), f2)\n     id       V1\n   1  a 10.86507\n   2  b      NaN\n\n\n</code></pre>\nplyr relaxes that limitation, that is, X can be a data frame itself -- which brings the huge benefit that your group by logic can operate over more than one column.  The function signature changes, but that&#x27;s the basic innovation.  The first letter indicates what X is, and the second letter indicates the output.  Thus ddply runs an enhanced tapply over a data frame input (first d) and collects the output into a data frame (the second d).  It also offers a bunch of nice enhancements; it&#x27;s really a solid bit of work.<p>data.table, otoh, removes some of the speed problems with the built in dataframes.  It offers keys/indices for quick lookup.<p>I haven&#x27;t spent much time with dplyr, but I think it does a couple things: (1) move the plyr code from R to c for performance reasons; it allows you to run plyr operations (with all code written in R) then translates most of that to something that can run in sql against remote dbs (for the obvious reason that plyr/group by produce summary stats, and those can be orders of magnitude smaller than the source data, so pulling that all into R to immediately discard most of it sucks).",1396887619

7547365,comment,7541601,7543635,1,0,sparkie,,,"I mean, we&#x27;re practically all advertisers in some way or another - every time we share a promotion with our friends, or even just discuss a new product we&#x27;re interested in. Most of the time we&#x27;re not advertising for the sake of profit, but just sharing interests with like-minded people.<p>Social media outlets attempt to tap into our general ignorance of advertising profitability - and they act as the middle-man between companies wishing to advertise, and the people who&#x27;re sharing with friends - but facebook take all of the profit by inserting themselves between these relationships, and the users who are sharing don&#x27;t notice they done a large part of the advertising work, for free.<p>Facebook can obviously provide some usefulness, because it knows where you are, what your interests are, and your recent activities - so it can target you for specific promotions. A recent video by Vertitasium[1] showed how this isn&#x27;t without problems though, and does not directly correspond to ROI for advertisers. (Likewise with many advertising models, there&#x27;s always people trying to game them to earn a quick buck). Facebook provide the &quot;advertising seed&quot;, by predicting who is likely to share.<p>I see a different potential model that could arise with the gaining popularity of cryptocurrencies and electronic transactions though - one where advertisers only pay when it results in a direct ROI, by tracing electronic signatures through a public, distributed ledger.<p>If a company wants to promote a product, and they offer a $10 advertising bounty for every advertisement which results in a direct sale. They initially create two digital signatures using &quot;cryptocurrency X&quot; and pass them to advertising agencies A and B. A advertises the product with &quot;Get $5 back off your purchase when you register your product using X&quot;, in which they make this guarantee by creating a transaction whereby the original input transaction from the company is used as the input, and the output is split in half between the buyer and A. When the buyer then registers their product with the advertising company, they release the $10 into the public ledger, which propagates $5 to A, and $5 back to the buyer. B is greedy and wants all of the $10 for themselves, but fails to make any direct sale, and thus, is not paid anything.<p>In this way, there can be any number of middle-men between the company and the buyer, and each party can agree on the fees they wish to have for each direct sale that results. By having a public ledger of who is making the sales, companies and advertisers alike can use analytics to discover the best routes to sales, and narrow down their advertising strategies, and agree on the most reasonable fees for each of the parties involved.<p>The social media aspect is to have this technology encoded into the social platform, such that it is mostly invisible to users - they simply &quot;promote&quot; an existing post which has a bounty attached to it, and if those re-posts eventually result in direct sales, their wallet starts to grow. The part where users need to actively know about the system is when they purchase and register their purchase, such as to trigger the release of the advertising fees through the chain in the public ledger.<p>These are only rough ideas and I have no idea how they&#x27;d be implemented effectively, including issues around anonymity and ensuring the system cannot be gamed by registering a product then returning it, for example, but I think there&#x27;s infinite potential for such ideas to replace the advertising empires - so that literally anyone can become a paid-advertiser, and where ones effectiveness as an advertiser results in profit. This wouldn&#x27;t make facebook et al obsolete, only distribute the profit a bit more - and it would help to improve the AI which is behind FB&#x27;s advertising, as it would be inefficient to promote things which aren&#x27;t likely to result in direct sales. Everyone wins, although facebook&#x27;s profits may decline a bit.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag</a>, also <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ZqXlHl65g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ZqXlHl65g</a>",1396887294

Commoditization of the PC market hasn&#x27;t touched Apple&#x27;s PC business in any way. What it does is lock the other PC vendors into a race to the bottom, leaving Apple as the only company with the resources and brand position to support premium gear at premium prices.<p>Exactly the same thing is happening in phones. Every single Android phone is in an even battle with every other Android phone. The market for premium Android devices in split roughly evenly between the top half dozen, perhaps even a dozen or more devices. Meanwhile the market for the premium iPhone is split between, er, one device. None of the other manufacturer can afford Apple&#x27;s software, services and several-year-long device support. This dynamic isn&#x27;t going to change any time soon.<p>At some point yes perhaps Apple&#x27;s huge phone margins may decline, but there&#x27;s no reason to suppose their premium brand position and margins will disappear completely for the foreseeable future. They&#x27;ve been living that life in the PC market for almost their entire existence. It&#x27;s what they do.",1396887165

I don&#x27;t believe that a business with such misrepresentation would have lasted this long without being called out. Hiding behind the not-for-profit label in markets where for-profits should be operating does nothing but distort the market and lull consumers/lenders into a false sense of do-gooding. These are financial markets and so we need to find effective market actors instead of not-for-profits that can unfairly compete due to their status.<p>By using the not-for-profit label and misrepresenting interest rates, Zidisha is also painting the picture (whether they intend to or not) that businesses in this space are exploitative and that Zidisha is good. Micro-loans are expensive loans! Businesses have to charge a lot for them to be economical, but access to credit for high-turnover businesses can make a huge a difference if it makes sense for the business.<p>What is really needed in the space isn&#x27;t necessarily a lending platform, but more data and better techniques to lend. It&#x27;s tough to vet entrepreneurs cheaply and at scale, but something I hope we will continue to get better at. There is a ton of money in the impact investing sector right now that could do a lot of good through market channels but lending in the developing world is still just too expensive and too risky.<p>I&#x27;ll close with another misleading statement from the October 2012 interview that the author of the blog post didn&#x27;t discuss:<p>... the total rate paid from the borrowerâs perspective averages 8.40%.  Note that this is not much above the average rate of inflation in the borrowersâ countries.<p>The problem here is that this statement assumes a stable currency against the US dollar. While 8.40% may be close to the inflation rate, for many of these countries an additional several percentage points of currency devaluation against the US dollar will raise the effective interest rate in local currency. I would love to understand how Zidisha deals with the challenge of currency fluctuations, especially when educating its borrowers.<p>I hope the takeaway from this is not that micro credit and lending in the developing world is bad and exploitative - just that it is expensive and nobody is that great at it yet. I&#x27;m disappointed in Zidisha&#x27;s misrepresentation but I hope it makes it clear that this isn&#x27;t a solved problem that greed and bad business practice is getting in the way of.

I have a reason to hide that from the rest of the market at least until I can complete my sale. HFTs profit by ascertaining my intentions faster than I can complete my intended action and then broadcasting my intentions to other market participants via the ticker tape, whereas previously my intentions were proprietary information locked in my head.<p>Let me see if I understand your example. I want to dump 100k@100$ and yet the current book doesn&#x27;t have that many buy orders (otherwise the order would just complete). The book has buy 1k@100 and sell 1k@105 So I try to be sneaky and just clean out the book with 1k@100, selling 100 shares each to 10 retail investors and wait for more 100$ retail investors to show up by placing another 1k@100 sell order. The HFT sees this quickly and puts in orders for buy at 90$ and sell at 95$. Now the next retail investor sees this and just buys at 95 instead of 100, saving 5. I need to then sell at 90 instead of 100, losing 10. The HFT firm makes 5.<p>So the HFT firm is taking money from informed investors and taking some for itself and giving some to people who have no special information about the market like retail investors. If that is the case the only problem with HFTs are second order. That (much like bitcoin) they spend a bunch of resources with busywork that could be at least partially eliminated by more decimal points in pricing trades. And that they may discourage some informed investors from adding information to the market because they can&#x27;t profit from it, reversing their benefit.",1396887011

Yes, post again when relevant.<p>Here are a few suggestions for the demo page:  Several pages of sample text would make the idea easier to evaluate.  The demo would benefit from some simple instructions (show/hide instructions).  I stumbled upon the functionality accidentally by using the mouse scroll wheel out of habit.    It took a while before I noticed the play buttons in the bottom right.  The speed adjuster is tedious to adjust.  I was out of sample text before I got it adjusted to a comfortable speed.  The arrows on the sides of the page don&#x27;t seem to fit with the idea.  I am not sure what they are for besides going back.  Maybe a clickable left to right progress bar would be better.

[t]he net result is that Big Joe would pay more to trade and Little Billie would pay less.<p>The debate about HFT is largely about who gets to benefit from new information. Suppose someone does a lot of research and discovers that a firm is undervalued. Should they get to profit from the information, at the expense of current stockholders? Or is it better for stockholders to quickly figure out that their holdings are worth more? HFT helps the stockholders in this case, because it moves the price faster to its eventual higher equilibrium before the researcher can buy up many shares at the (low) current price. The researcher may have expended a lot of time and effort to get this information, and with the existence of HFT their work may not be sustainable.<p>Contrast this with someone who accidentally discovers public information that could be profitable, or someone who engages in insider trading. In both these cases it&#x27;s hard to argue that we as a society should create rules that let them profit at others&#x27; expense.<p>In other spheres of life (software patents, copyrights), the law over-protects dubious discoveries and creations. Is information related to stock pricing different? Are we under-protecting it, such that we should let someone with new information collect more profit than they can today?",1396886652

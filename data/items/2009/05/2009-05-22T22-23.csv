622867,comment,622643,622849,0,0,atduskgreg,,,"Maybe above 10,000 if you aggregate over the entire multi-decade period that the Basic Stamp has been around. Maybe. Also, BASIC the programming language may be simpler than Ruby, it may even be simpler that C/C++ that you program the Arduino in. But it's still much harder to get starter programming a Basic Stamp and much harder to get it to do anything useful. How long would it take an intermediate PHP programmer with no previous electronics experience to build a device that posted a tweet whenever they pressed a button using a Basic Stamp? With an Arduino and the right shields, that project would take less than an hour including downloading the IDE and getting everything configured.",1243033148

622863,comment,621198,621407,0,0,joeyo,,,"Thanks for the clarification.<p>I suspect that my G1 has a bad GPS module because I find that when I have it disabled, I can get a somewhat accurate measurement of my current location via cell towers or whatever, however if I have it enabled, it can't figure out where I am at all (at least not within the amount of time that I am willing to wait for it-- 1 minute or so). So I leave it disabled pretty much all the time in an attempt to keep the battery life long.<p>If it were up to me (and I must admit I have not looked at how the location API works), I would have location services return an imprecise value quickly (via cell towers or wifi or whatever) and refine it as the GPS came online. Sensor fusion is still an active research topic, but there are at least some simple heuristics that could be used if it was inefficient to make a full Bayesian inference.",1243032982

622846,comment,622618,622696,0,0,whacked_new,,,"From what I have seen (not much, but probably more than most programmers), they don't. I suspect the reason is because everybody has at least one native spoken language, but programming languages are not native in the same way; they are acquired, and so are not perceived as a necessity.<p>And as such, for most people it is much harder to have a ""favorite spoken language"" that they can use as a platform to bash other languages. The way that programmers, text editor users, and coffee drinkers bash each other is bashing someone for an acquired taste. Bashing other languages is almost like bashing someone's physical appearance, and the immaturity becomes very obvious a lot quicker.<p>Also, regarding compactness of the spoken language, on average, English is longer than, say, Chinese. But brevity is NOT the goal. The tradeoff is redundancy, which English has much more of (e.g. parallelism and verb/plurality agreement). Old Chinese, with all its homophones, has plenty of texts written so compactly that if you don't read the text you will not understand it (at least for modern pupils).",1243031952

It's easy enough to achieve with a defmacro-style macro system - just use gensyms.<p>Hygiene can also be baked-in to a nice lispy defmacro-style system; there's no reason that hygienic macros have to be scheme-style.  Variable capture can be permitted with a (capture x) special form.  (I like to use ^x as a shorthand for that).<p>At that point, macros start behaving scope-wise similarly to lexical functions, and captured variables behave kind of like dynamic variables in a function.<p>It suddenly occurs to me that this form of hygiene could be implemented in the expansion of let, lambda and defun forms, at which point <i>(someone yell at me please if I'm wrong)</i>, plain-ol' defmacros would be hygienic, unless there's a type of variable capture that I'm forgetting about right now...",1243030184

The ease of just using USB is a win along with a mixed community of experts, amateurs and kids. The synergy and accessibility is the main point of the article IMHO.",1243030132

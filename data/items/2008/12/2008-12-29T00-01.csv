With that in mind I offer the following as a constructive criticism.<p>HelpSpot prospects need more help determining if it's an appropriate solution: what are three symptoms or specific bug tracking needs that would indicate HelpSpot is the right choice compared to alternatives? The case studies don't have to badmouth competitive alternatives, but they should explain how customers determined it was a better choice.<p>HelpSpot clearly has satisfied customers, but they don't offer a meaningful differentiation or help prospects with a specific needs analysis.

412375,comment,412184,412194,0,0,DougBTX,,,"Yep, you're right.<p>To turn anecdotes into data, you need good answers to these two questions:<p>- Are the samples very similar? (ie, same models, same usage patterns)<p>- Do they vary in a predictable way from a control group?<p>The only things which are the same between the samples are the owner, and the brand. We don't know any specifics about internal product testing and development, so it is a stretch to say that those details are the same across all samples.<p>The control group is non-existent: it is assumed to be a group of computers identical in every way to those being tested, except they never fail. That is: the control group is imagined to be just what is needed to prove the desired conclusions.<p>Having said all that, I have had repair-under-warranty problems with all the Macs that I have owned too.",1230510878

Given the recent decision by Automattic to exclude premium themes from the directory, this is a pretty interesting way for theme developers to still get recognition and a nice return from the community for their hard work.<p>In this particular instance, personally I think $2000 is a pretty high price to ask unless (a) he plans on releasing a whole slew of themes or (b) he's developed a theme that just completely takes WordPress and turns it on its head in a stunning spectacle of presentation, functionality and utility.  But that's my own opinion on the matter.<p>I think community supported programming is a rather unique, and interesting idea and wanted to get your opinions on the idea.<p>Go.",1230510499

At Dropbox we've noticed disproportionately more Mac/Linux users (relative to the ""worldwide norm"" or whatever that means, which is pretty standard).

But I agree it's a risky ballpark to play in. One potentially big advantage, though, is if you're an unknown, this can raise your profile. So, even if this venture is unprofitable because of the legal costs and eventual revenue sharing with the content owners, by working on something that gains traction, you can leverage this reputation and experience on a future venture, which may put you in a more advantageous position than someone starting out from zero.<p>Or the energy sucked out of you from the lawsuit might make you want to leave the field entirely.",1230509490

Sure, the point is valid that hiring is ""biased"" towards kids in their early twenties who are really good programmers. But the idea I would think is to progress up the ladder so that when one is in mid-career, one is not doing the day-to-day programming so much as more management type of tasks. Myself, right now I do test automation, and so spend my days mostly writing test suites using the silktest language and the like. But I don't plan to be still doing that years from now. Hopefully I can sort of move up the ladder a bit into being like a test lead or something.

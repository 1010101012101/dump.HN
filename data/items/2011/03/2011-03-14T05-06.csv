There are quite a lot of people who appear ignorant, needlessly antagonistic, and generally unlikable - yet they somehow mastered the art of getting a lot of support and sympathy. Often you realize too late that a pointless little discussion was actually a pretty good setup to gather support from the other people on the team. This is usually the moment where you discover that your opponent isn't as stupid as you always thought.<p>I wish I had something more positive to say, but in my experience it makes little sense to go up against those people, mainly because they're simply better at manipulating everyone, but also because doing so will eat a lot of your time and energy for trying to beat them at their own game. In my experience there is often a reason why this kind of person works at your company: it's either because management failed at hiring decent people, or it's because they hired someone who actually reflects their own morals there. In any case, the company's culture has probably already been subverted. Staying away from these environments is more rewarding than adapting to them.<p>> <i>So is this a hopeless situation? I'm a bit hesitant to jump ship because my work history in the Valley hasn't been terrific.</i><p>You know, it doesn't sound like you are working there for the awesome product and the great team experience to begin with.

2321455,comment,2321158,2321179,0,0,asharp,,,"IANANS, however from what I understand the problem is this:
-> The reactor is a BWR type, hence even though it is scrammed it is still generating some amount of power from fission products. 
-> The ECCS failed, meaning that the core can't maintain sufficient cooling.
-> So what water was left in the core is then exposed to very high temperatures and pressures.
-> That apparently then creates conditions sufficient to cause the water to react with the zirconium alloy which is used in the fuel rods, forming zirconium dioxide and hydrogen. (2H2O + Zn -> ZnO2 + 2H2).
-> As reactors generally don't create much gaseous waste (The only waste products that I can think of would be, for example, radon, and that would be in small quantities), and the core isn't expected to be above the autoignition temperature of whatever gas that is being vented. What could be happening is that the gas is being vented but is being concentrated at some point where it comes into contact with something hot enough to ignite it thus causing an explosion. For example, if the gas is being vented out of the core, but into a secondary containment vessel, if the vessel is filled with air and if it contains say a piece of metal hot enough to ignite the hydrogen, it would simply fill with gas until it reaches a point where the mixture is explosive, before then it then explodes.<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a nuclear scientist, any corrections/additional information would be very welcome.",1300081594

2321436,comment,2320976,2320976,0,0,btilly,,,"I've known about this one for years, and it is one of the reasons I don't want to move back to the Pacific Northwest (I grew up in Victoria).<p>It was only in the last few decades that geologists realized the size of the earthquakes that the area experiences.  Building codes have not caught up.  And a lot of the population centers in the area, including Seattle, Vancouver and Victoria, have important construction predating any useful building codes.<p>A few areas have notable risks.<p>The scariest is Victoria.  It is on Vancouver Island, which typically drops 10 feet during a Cascadia earthquake.  Most of the city is under 20 feet above sea level.  Add a tsunami, and a lot of that could be covered.  (I've read the projections for a tsunami from the Cascadia quake are about 30 meters.  But I have no idea how big the tsunami would be within the Straits of Juan de Fuca, which is what Victoria would be exposed to.)  Normally one would worry about the fact that densely populated areas (like James Bay) are largely built on landfill, which behaves poorly in earthquake.  But that's incidental compared to being unexpectedly under the new sea level.  I don't know exactly how many people would be under the new sea level, but I think it is about 100,000.  (You can see the distribution of people in <a href=""http://www.victoria.ca/cityhall/pdfs/sustainability-census-population.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.victoria.ca/cityhall/pdfs/sustainability-census-p...</a>.  All of Oak Bay, most of Victoria, a significant portion of Esquimalt, all of View Royal, some of Saanich, and a small part of Langford would be under water.)   Given the unavailability of higher ground and low water temperature, I don't expect a lot of survivors.<p>Next look at the delta area of Vancouver.  It is called the delta because it is the river delta from the Fraser River.  Which means dirt with a high water level.  Take dirt and water, and shake.  What do you get?  Mud!  The delta area of Vancouver is perfect for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_liquefaction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_liquefaction</a>.

Odds are that a Cascadia earthquake wouldn't trigger one of those lahars with 150,000 people in its path.  That will happen some day regardless.  But if it did, and you had a lahar on top of a major earthquake, well, nothing good would happen.<p>Japan lost perhaps 10,000 people in this earthquake and tsunami.  I firmly believe that a Cascadia quake would kill at least an order of magnitude more people in Victoria alone.  And, unlike Japan, there is no real disaster preparedness ethic to mitigate the follow-up to the disaster.",1300080869

I see no reason this can't become what the Cool Kids in College all want.  You need someone (like me) who is completely neurotic about their grades and feels the need to call their sister and have a nervous breakdown for 30 minutes because, gasp, my first grade on my first paper after returning to college 8 years later was below a 95 (clearly the end of the world).  This person also needs to be someone that other people like/look up to/want to emulate for some reason.  (This was me at one time in some circles on the internet where I got treated like a ""rock star"" and compared to one -- though it definitely wasn't me in high school.)  In some geeky circles, someone who is smart and grade obsessed can also be someone ""cool"" that others are enthralled by.  Find those folks. If they will use it, others will use it.<p>Rather than sharing grades, I think I would find a means to share some measure of what value the product brought.  One possibility:  Show that their grades improve when they use this.  Another possibility:  Show that they stress less about school now that they are clear where they stand at all times.  Another possible angle:  Now that they are stressing less, they have more of a life because they are clear what they need to do and can set aside the whole obsessive grade focus on Friday night (or whatever) and have a little fun.  This last idea might need some additional support, like some kind of study tracker/support tools in that regard.

Those in my neighborhood, whom I know based on locality, and those scattered around the city, whom I know (and know each other) through mutual interests. One has nine individuals (with more - about 5-10 who are acquaintances, but not truly friends), and the other has eight individuals (with more - again, about 5-10 who are acquaintances).<p>Maybe I'm a-social or something. But. There is no overlap between these groups. I've introduced a few in one to a few in the other, but there's no reason for them to gel. They probably aren't friends on Facebook. Using cluster analysis, you could easily partition my groups of friends & acquaintances out.<p>Can you give an example of what kind of situation might confuse this system? What if it took further demographics into account as vertices with directed edges (whereas friendship, in the graph, is an undirected edge), such as age group, gender, location, employer?<p>I would assume that status updates only travel one hop on the graph, so that even if someone becomes a part of one of these clusters, if you don't have an explicit connection to them your status updates cannot be seen by them.<p>You could further weight the edges by how often you communicate with each other via the service.<p>What would probably happen - and pure conjecture here - is that you would be exposing your status updates to either the boundary of a cluster (you are on the outside of the cluster, with a few connections in), or to most of the cluster (you are in the center of the cluster, with many connections in it). Situation one is more likely with friends (unless they are very isolated friends indeed), while situation two is more likely with family and co workers. Likely, you (and perhaps your spouse) would be the only people in your family network that have direct connections to people in, say, a drinking-buddies network. Unless members of your family are also drinking buddies.",1300080530

I’d say that I’m an applied math major who wants to go into biomathematics but doesn’t want to use that degree for anything, never revealing that what I really want to do is run a web business.<p>Soon after the last time I hid my true passion during a conversation I decided to release my web app no matter how unfinished I felt it to be. Since the release I’ve received several users per day (although I don’t think I’ve gotten more than a few dedicated users) at a total cost of just under $30. Importantly, though, because of my ads I’ve been contacted by the director of education of a major university to see if she should recommend the app to students or not. We’re still talking, but this could be what brings the first good number of users to my site.<p>The app isn’t sexy and it isn’t going to change the world. Simply put, it’s a grade calculator and tracker. After using spreadsheets to figure out my grades for too long, I decided that there was at least a small need for a web app. Achiever, as I decided to call it, was born in February.<p>You can find it at http://www.getachiever.com<p>I’m curious, what do I do next? There is still technical work to do - the completion of the landing page design, the implementation of recurring billing - but I have arrived at what I believe to be the true challenge of web business: getting people to actually use my creation. Since it’s not a social app, I can’t create serious viral effects. Would, perhaps, letting users post their grades bring traffic? Should I try to market the app instead to universities?<p>A lot of the apps submitted to HN are sexy and took 24 hours to make and, seemingly, tend to include the letter three in the name. I didn’t want to go after sexy and social and business model-less (look where Twitter is this week). I wanted to make a well-built tool, like Basecamp, and charge people for it.

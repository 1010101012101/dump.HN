You can prevent fraud on the Internet by doing tricky filtering. You can&#x27;t prevent someone from stealing a sandwich at gunpoint by rewriting how the universe works.<p>Enforcement is not perfect, but that the police can punish the armed sandwich thief in principle is already a deterrent. It is common knowledge who in this situation would be in the right. Compare with government-free world, where to determine who&#x27;s right we&#x27;d have to make our security companies get into a firefight over it.

Not having operator precedence made Smalltalk eaiser to learn by 8 year olds, but much harder to sell to engineers.<p>However, if we&#x27;d like to get at what in language design can facilitate learning, reduce bug rates, and enhance productivity, we probably should do some research by introducing programming languages to children.

I would more, but it generally isn&#x27;t appreciated and is off topic of the main thread. Here, the software license is a key component of the release seeing as it is a unique component of it.<p>>Open source is about the source being open plus certain benefits.<p>It&#x27;s more than that. The key intent of OSS is the right to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. The source code is just a prereq for that ability.<p>I did initially use stallman-esque language, since it&#x27;s terminology most people are familiar with in this field, but I&#x27;ll approach it from a different point since I personally have problems with strong copy-left licenses.<p>The primary thing this license doesn&#x27;t do is allow distribution in the OSS spirit. This is really just a pervasive license, actually in some ways similar to the Stallman-esque virality except with a corporate intent. It simply masquerades as OSS.",1448387923

Regardless of your title choice, Nvidia will at least have parity with AMD&#x27;s performance and will usually crush it. It is hard to persuade gamers to adopt a video card with significantly lower performance / $ when they don&#x27;t care about software ethics.<p>And its inappropriate to say AMD have &quot;better&quot; open source drivers - Nvidia has nothing to do with Nouveau besides three commits to make their mobile APUs boot right on it so people can immediately install their blob driver, and its a disservice to the community and all the developers that have put huge effort reverse engineering one of the worst technical black boxes in history to give Nvidia any credit for their work.

It has always struck me that the gravamen of the Open Source movement has been to accelerate the improvement of important common libraries by enabling anyone to view and evolve source code, with the &#x27;evolution&#x27; taking either the free or a commercial license. The simple fact is that, over the last few decades, there have been good and bad improvements under open licenses and good and bad improvements under commercial licenses. It&#x27;s the <i>possibility of improvement</i> that is important.<p>I might go even further, and suggest that if one had to parcel the value created by open source software into two buckets, the one being value created by reason of <i>transparent</i> source code, and the other being value created by reason of <i>no-cost</i> source, the majority of the marginal value creation will have been because of the former, not the latter.",1448387523

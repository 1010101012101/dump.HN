6228499,comment,6220820,6221807,1,0,ezy,,,"If you remember the (gnu, ossp) pth library or any of the various cooperative multitasking equivalents for C, this is all the people raised on javascript, who started writing callback APIs for C#/ObjC discovering the same idea.<p>await is equivalent to &quot;yield&quot; or &quot;wait&quot; in most of those systems.  The idea is to pause execution and jump back to the cooperative scheduler, which will eventually execute the function call in question.  Once that call ends up with a result, the scheduler will then (eventually) resume your function with the result at the point you yielded.  In the midst of all that, various other threads of control will be scheduled briefly -- for instance, the ones servicing sockets and whatnot.  It&#x27;s all single threaded and cooperative -- typically with an event system embedded.<p>Part of the callback &quot;mess&quot; is the result of the short memory of our industry.  I was working with these kinds of systems in C code years and years ago.  It didn&#x27;t take long for most people to realize that you wanted to abstract the callbacks to the scheduler so you were writing your code instead fucking with the state machine mechanism used to implement the cooperative framework in question.  No references to abstract CSP (or CPS :-)) ideas needed, really -- it&#x27;s basic practical knowledge that seems to have been ignored over time.",1376726271

In our case that was not a factor, since Docker is a static binary built in Go, and all distros are equally hapless in their management of that. In fact, we are divorcing ourselves completely from distro-specific dependency management. As of this week, docker  packages are built by us in an environment we control, not the distro build farms (hint: we build docker with docker). Then we wrap it with fpm and call it a day. Separately, we are working with downstream maintainers of each distro to help them package docker in a policy-compliant way. But those are 2 completely separate tracks.",1376725756

However there is (usually) a deliberate effort to overload students with volumes of work, so that they can figure out how the real world works and work in teams. 
Also in my MBA course students had a minimum of quantitative work they had to do, and if they wanted they could dive deeply into the more serious mathematics in certain courses. It was part of the expectations that people who were more technical or more experienced in one area would help out those who had less experience, and vice versa.<p>Engineering mathematics is not for everyone, and indeed not required for every MBA graduate, but it certainly helps for the more quantitative courses.  And finance at one school can differ wildly from finance at other schools. Look for the professors. Look at the courses people take.

After all, why should they line the pockets of a bunch of non-productive speculators? What possible incentive would they have?<p>The only reason the equities market works is because investors get a fair return on their investment, consistent with the risks they take, and businesses get operating capital at a reasonable rate as well. Both parties to the transaction get a fair deal. All this talk about making a killing in stocks using &quot;secrets of the winners&quot; overlooks the fact that, if it were possible, if someone could really make a fortune by something other than blind luck, reliably, deterministically, the market would collapse.<p>And for the life of me, I can&#x27;t understand why people find this so hard to understand.",1376724915

There is no evidence for the assumption, and the only reliable evidence stands against it, like the WSJ Dartboard Contest.<p>If a particular institution does better than the averages, the most likely explanation is chance, and no other explanation has anything resembling scientific evidence. And the Dartboard Contest demonstrates that, when called on to put up or shut up, the professionals weren&#x27;t able to put up.<p>> The stock market rose by about 8 or 9% annually during that time.

On completion the machine will provably produce the result it promised to return in its owner&#x27;s manual (i.e. the declared return code).<p>None of this is &quot;goto&quot; in any way. In goto land, without knowing the exact set of inputs a program receives and whole-system simulation, it is utterly impossible to make assumptions about even the most minimal pieces of state in the program at any given moment.<p>Contrast to a function call. A function call is a fixed guarantee about the state of the system at the point a machine begins executing. Furthermore a function call has a vastly restricted set of valid behaviours: at some point it must terminate, and prior to termination, update the system state (stack) to include its return value. And upon termination, result in the calling machine to resume operation.<p>All this syntax sugar shit is <i>whack</i>. Great, you typed 24 characters instead of 3 lines to declare a lambda.

Remember that the Cold War ended up only lasting about 4 decades or so, which limited the amount of time for incidents to occur that could have led to WWIII. Also remember that the process of succession of the leadership of the USSR was a very convoluted one. Most Soviet leaders remained in office until they died, which meant that a succession could occur at any moment, possibly even during a period where unusual things were happening with the party which might get sorted out quickly but could result in someone seizing power who might otherwise not had the chance. Also remember that dirty politics and coups were rampant in the communist sphere of influence and there is little reason to assume those tactics would not be used at home (as indeed they were). Especially considering the unsuccessful coup against Gorbachev. Given these things it&#x27;s safe to say that there was absolutely no significant guarantee that the leader of the Soviet Union could be expected to be reasonable in any way. As indeed the example of Stalin plainly shows.<p>It&#x27;s immanently possible both that the Cold War could have extended several years if not decades longer and an aggressive political figure akin to Stalin could have taken control of the Soviet Union almost at any point during its history.<p>Given these facts the idea that a pre-emptive nuclear strike from the Soviets could have occurred at any time during the Cold War was not as far fetched as we in the present, having avoided such a calamity, should assume. All it would have taken was the death of the General Secretary at an inopportune time and some sort of fight for supremacy within the party married with some sort of geopolitical state of high tension and a firebrand Soviet leader who ends up in control of a sufficient part of the armed forces (or perhaps all of them).",1376722955

The improvement in local readability is often superficial and the cost in overall readability (not to mention bugs, which increase with code size) is often nontrivial.<p>In the examples, each line of code with a named function appears more readable, but this is only because its meaning has become less denseand as there is also now more code to read, the two factors arguably cancel each other out. Meanwhile the new code has more non-locality: the eye of the reader must jump between the various function invocations and declarations. That&#x27;s a lot of jumping, and it will get much worse as complexity grows.<p>Introducing a name has costs as well as benefits. For example, it adds indirection: the name now stands between the reader and the thing that is named. To overcome this, a name should say something about the problem the code is solving. If all it says is something about the code itself, that&#x27;s not goodit adds weight and obscures the problem (because you&#x27;re now taking more code to solve it). It feels like you&#x27;re simplifying code by factoring it in this way, but you may only be spreading it out more, making pieces which are logically bound together further apart from each other.<p>A sign that this is happening is when you can&#x27;t think of a good name for the code you are factoring, or when the name refers only to the code itself. &quot;wtfFriendAction&quot; is a comical example, but I think &quot;gotFriends&quot; is more instructive: it tells you nothing more than &quot;I am the callback for getFriends&quot;, and thus adds no information to the original code, only verbosity.",1376722897

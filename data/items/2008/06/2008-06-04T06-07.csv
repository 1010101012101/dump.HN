It's true, there are less choices available for cheap ASP.NET hosting but Ultimahosts have got to be among the best.<p>You might have to ask to get it but they have shared plans that offer 400 MB storage, unlimited SQL databases, Dotnetpanel controls, unlimited domains + subdomains etc. and plenty of bandwidth to mess around for $15/month.<p>In fact, they don't seem to even track bandwidth.<p>My most memory-intensive sites are not on shared hosting but I have many smaller sites hosted on a single shared account. Good luck.",1212562501

International pressure, mainly from Australia, influenced the Vanuatu government to begin adhering to international norms to improve transparency. In Vanuatu, there are no income tax, no withholding tax, no capital gains tax, no inheritance taxes, or exchange controls. A disproportionately large number of ship-management companies choose to flag their ships under the Vanuatu flag, because of the tax benefits and favorable labor laws. Several file-sharing groups, such as the providers of the KaZaA network of Sharman Networks and the developers of WinMX, have chosen to incorporate in Vanuatu to avoid regulation and legal challenges.""",1212562152

You can't do everything at every time in your life.
I'd rather see the world when I have money to see it in a bit of style.<p>Everything shapes who you are from then on, and an experience like travelling may have a big effect on your later life. But so does being a parent, or starting a company, or any number of other big experiences. You just have to make a judgement as to which you want to experience first.<p>You could make a similar argument for having kids later in life - to some it doesn't any sense to wait until you're old and tired to have kids.",1212562134

Is this amount reasonable? <i>Hell no</i>. As has been stated above, these companies got massive tax breaks and subsidies (and sometimes monopoly powers) on the promise of limitless bandwidth and fiber everywhere. They have been essentially selling dial-up ever since. (At these caps, they still are). I call that stealing.<p>What I meant was, this is slightly more honorable than telling the customer that it is <i>unlimited</i> and then cutting off the account without warning when the magic undisclosed number is reached. This way the customer knows in advance that the service sucks monkey balls and can choose an alternative if possible.",1212561719

208659,comment,208630,208630,0,0,DenisM,,,"One way to do it is make founders firable ""at will"" instead of ""for cause"", so if one founder is acting up the others can kick him out to satisfy any defintion of ""leaving"" and that's that. The downside is that co-founders can conspire agianst you and kick you out for no good reason. So you have to weight probability of one founder dragging his feet vs. several founders conspiring against an innocent.
On the third side, eventually you will get investors and they may choose to fire you ""at will"" if your agreement allows that.<p>Confused yet? Now go talk to your lawyer - he should have experience.",1212560926

Internationally, he comes off as a sensitive and reasonable American patriot - I think this is a very good combination for international relations.",1212560198

208649,comment,208518,208636,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"I don't think you should worry about being downmodded for injecting facts (downmodding is more of a reflection of the community rather than the validity or relevance of a statement) so never have that be a determinant of your opinions.<p>I would definitely agree with you, as I am sure you would with this statement, that Obama would not renounce himself from the church if it were not for the presidential election and the way the media has portrayed the situation.  But what we might disagree on is what the definition of spirituality is, and subsequently what that influence has on values and opinions.  You and me could have exactly the same viewpoints on every aspect of every thought but differ on spirituality and views of god etc, but does that necessarily mean that those values would reflect in our decision making process.<p>I don't necessarily support radical values (being white it would make sense that I am not a black ""radical"") but I will admit that sometimes it takes a group of radicals to have influence on a larger group to bring influence and equilibrium to the status quo.<p>To inject more facts into the thread and refute the McCain statement, a slow undercurrent and momentum has been to show light on McCains pastor Hagee:<p><a href=""http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/the_mccainhagee_connection_1.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/the_mccainhagee_connection_...</a><p>Basically the same, yet opposing views, of Wright.  Any logical individual will acknowledge that Black's have been oppressed throughout the history of this country, but I don't think that either of us are in any position to make judgment on whether they should feel as though they need to advance their race or make sure that they are considered equals among society any more etc.<p>I think the line that was crossed by Wright was the press conference right before Obama disassociated himself from Wright.  It was clear at that point that Wright was taking advantage of the media coverage and milking the spotlight.  I would have done the same if someone that I considered a friend sold me out to fame, fortune, press, whatever.  To me, integrity and ethics are more important that religious values.",1212559970

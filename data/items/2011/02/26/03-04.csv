Delete operations are typically limited to flagging data blocks as ""not in use"" in the file system.[5][6] Contrary to, for example, an overwrite operation, a delete will therefore not involve a physical write to the sectors that contain the data.

The code is not super-pretty, but it uses appropriate locking strategies and has been well-tested in threaded environments. All three major implementations (JRuby, MRI and Rubinius) share the vast majority of the Ruby standard library, so if JRuby works, Rubinius will work.<p>2) For the part of MRI written in C (which Rubinius calls the ""kernel""), Rubinius has reimplemented the entire thing mostly in Ruby with some primitives. Since they own that code, it is their responsibility to define its semantics when run in parallel.<p>3) Rubinius implements its locking classes (like Mutex and ConditionVariable, see <a href=""https://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/blob/master/lib/thread.rb#L40"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/blob/master/lib/thread.r...</a>) on top of its own low-level Channel implementation (see <a href=""https://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/blob/master/kernel/bootstrap/channel.rb#L15"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/blob/master/kernel/boots...</a>), which can be used to implement more sophisticated locking strategies.

When I speak to students from programs other than Computer Science, even from other scientific disciplines, they question why they should ever have to take a Computer Science class. But if you tell a Chemistry major he needs a Physics course, or tell a Biology major that he needs a Chemistry course, it is likely to be accepted as perfectly reasonable. To many, CS == Computer Programming.<p>But this is a tough problem. To get non-CS students interested, we probably need to stress the applicability and practicality of being able to understand fundamentals and concepts of Computer Science as applied to other scientific disciplines. ""Putting the science back into Computer Science"" may be the only way to do so, while also dispelling the notion that you only need Computer Science education if you wish to program computers for a living.",1298691745

Most of them primarily focus on anime-style content, but I haven't seen anyone else get even close to the level of effective user-driven tagging that they have.<p>Take Danbooru, the most successful such site, for example.  Do you want an image of a long-haired character from the Touhou game series wearing a ribbon while involved in a hug?  <i>You can do that</i> (search ""long_hair touhou ribbon hug"") and get over 200 results, all relevant.  A large part of this is due to effective moderation in order to keep tags consistent.<p>Now here's the most intriguing part: how does Danbooru make money?  They charge for a premium account -- which <i>allows you to search with more than 2 keywords at once</i>.  Yes, that's right -- they monetize based on little more than the power of their tagging system.  This shows just how important tag-intersection search can be -- and doubly so for porn.",1298691741

Auguste Comte and Emile Durkheim, both foundational to the social sciences, each sought to bring empiricism and the scientific method to the study of social institutions. I would argue that they were largely successful and it is a shift in our modern understanding of science that questions whether Social Science is ""real"" science.<p>Specifically, I think the power of mathematics as a tool for objective description of natural phenomena has given us the impression that any field without underpinning equations is soft, subjective, and inherently unscientific. Biology is Chemistry is Physics is Math, but the study of social institutions resists reduction to ""hard"" sciences, to the objectivity of equations. I have even seen people say that Chemistry is not science!<p>In this view, Sociology seems inherently less legitimate than Biology. And I think that is dangerous.

Yes, the amount of forms you have to fill out is ridiculous. Yes, the fact that the simulator .iso has an installer is crazy. With those things, I absolutely agree with you. They're just silly... but they're also not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.<p>It took me less than 2 hours from when I decided I wanted to  make a Playbook app to when I had something running in the simulator. You're correct that the iOS SDK is easier to get started with, and it's only a single download... but it's also 3.5 gigs, <i>every single time</i>. I'll take three 100mb downloads over a 3.5 gig download any day.<p>Ok, as for the cost of things... You only need to pay for VMWare if you're on a Mac, on a PC it's free. I've talked to some guys at RIM about this, and they said they were trying to work out a deal with VMWare to make it free for Mac users as well.<p>There's no more $200 fee. I don't know why anyone still brings it up. The 10 app limit is a GOOD THING, and keep in mind that you're also getting a 100% <i>free</i> Playbook if you make an app right now, surely that's gotta be worth something.<p>As for the notary thing, I'm guessing that's because of the free Playbook offer. They don't want to give away 10 Playbooks to the same guy. If you're a company, Apple's process is even more painful. You actually have to snail-mail all your forms in and wait until they get them before you can publish anything.<p>All the other complaints were just petty. Who cares about the IP address and the password? That stuff takes 2 minutes to figure out.<p>There are a lots of positives about developing for Playbook that you didn't mention. For example, an interesting (and not well-known fact) is that application updates <i>do not</i> require approval on App World. That's a <i>huge</i> plus over iOS in my book.<p>Anyway, that's my thoughts on it.<p>TLDR: You definitely had some good points, but the rest of it got blown WAY out of proportion.",1298690174

The HR datastore is specifically designed to address the concerns about variable latency of datastore operations, and to prevent both planned and unplanned downtime.<p>2) In my experience, high CPU cost for datastore operations is generally tied to things like having large numbers of indexes, or doing queries that don't have the right indexes.  Each index written involves a bigtable write, if you are doing hundreds of these per entity it can become very expensive.  That said, in general it isn't easy enough to know when you are doing something that will be expensive.<p>3) The bulkloader is definitely painful to use if you aren't familiar with it.  In particular, casting schemaless data to a format such as CSV is hard because of the problem that rows can have unexpected keys.  An improved ""Bulk Datastore Import and Export tool"" is on the 6-month roadmap for the product.",1298689814

The OS can kill processes if it runs low on memory without indicating that the app just quit and it will keep processes running if it has plenty of resources even if the user explicitly quits the app. (Developers have to allow the OS to do that.)<p>What annoys me about this is that to the user, the behavior seems unpredictable. Many apps now (appear to) quit automatically, i.e. they disappear from the Dock (which I think is better than the old way of apps hanging around forever in the Dock if you don’t quit them manually) but equally many apps don’t do that. That has been a problem before but in the past at least most apps did the same. Now you don’t know what’s going to happen.<p>Another problem are apps you want to run all the time like Mail or Skype.

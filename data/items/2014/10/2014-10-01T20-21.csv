8397684,comment,8394381,8397096,2,0,daralthus,,,"Thinking of programming as a dialogue with the computer is a really strong metaphor that I gladly recognize as something that inspired you [1][2].<p>Short: You provide the goals and the constraints, then through a back and forth dialogue with the computer you describe and clarify the problem (and also your understanding). You keep on negotiating and providing more constraints until it simply finds a possible solution (the problem domain is now computable) or the best fitting solution now satisfies your needs (in time).<p>The hardest parts are probably:\n1. Collecting, developing the constraint solvers. Should we imagine that collection more as platform of user contributed (programmed/trained) packages?\n2. Developing the dialouge that is not just textual but visual (in both ways) (notepad vs IDE vs Theater(?!) don&#x27;t forget macros/acting out!)). Showing is always faster then writing and gives one better cues on the closures/framework of the actual discussion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2014/07/21/imperative-thinking-and-the-making-of-sandwiches/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2014/07/21/imperative-thi...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/jamii/8957881c8eaa4035f4ae"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jamii/8957881c8eaa4035f4ae</a>",1412197188

Establishing new languages is a powerful strategy for controlling complexity in engineering design; we can often enhance our ability to deal with a complex problem by adopting a new language that enables us to describe (and hence to think about) the problem in a different way, using primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction that are particularly well suited to the problem at hand.&quot;<p><a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-25.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-25.htm...</a>",1412197068

The damage may be physical (for example, hepatitis) or mental (for example, depressive episodes secondary to heavy alcohol intake). Harmful use commonly, but not invariably, has adverse social consequences; social consequences in themselves, however, are not sufficient to justify a diagnosis of harmful use&quot;.<p>> In ICD-10 the &#x27;dependence syndrome&#x27; is defined as: &quot;a cluster of behavioural, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and that typically include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal state&quot;.<p>Looking at the English guidelines for treatment we see that medically supervised withdrawal starts when you&#x27;re drinking 40 units <i>per day</i> - that would be a one liter bottle of 40% whisky every day.<p>Here&#x27;s the full guideline:<p><a href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs11/chapter/introduction-and-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs11/chapter/introduction-an...</a><p>And here&#x27;s the bit for lower end: <a href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs11/chapter/quality-statement-11-psychological-interventions-and-relapse-prevention-medication-for-adults"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs11/chapter/quality-stateme...</a>",1412196683

That&#x27;s one thing to have a complete different language that compiles down to JS,but as soon as you introduce macros is your code you make it harder to understand and document.I&#x27;m glad it works for you,but in my opinion the use of macros should be banned.While limited to nodejs, I personally think fibers are better alternative.<p>4. I actually think that it makes promises elegant. You can chain 20 then and have a single catch in case things are wrong,but you need to adjust the logic accordingly.Using different Error &quot;classes&quot; and checking the type is usually what I do.<p>I still believe promises are an elegant way to deal with async programming,and ES6 lambdas will make them even less painfull.<p>I&#x27;m not sold on generators for async programming strangely ,for multiple reasons(lack of support in browser land,especially on mobile).<p>EDIT: macros are fine in LISP likes because it&#x27;s not like these languages have a complex syntax.

8397631,comment,8396375,8396375,14,0,wuliwong,,,"Isn&#x27;t it possible that the issue is in the difficulty in classifying people as &quot;addicts&quot; instead of concluding that most addicts just grow out of it? The alcoholics in my family do not grow out of it. To a man (or woman) they just deteriorate over the years and it is a very sad thing to watch. It seems possible that what the author had and what my family members have are two different afflictions.<p>>Moreover, if addiction were truly a progressive disease, the data should show that the odds of quitting get worse over time. In fact, they remain the same on an annual basis, which means that as people get older, a higher and higher percentage wind up in recovery. If your addiction really is “doing push-ups” while you sit in AA meetings, it should get harder, not easier, to quit over time.<p>Clearly the author is questioning the progressive nature of addiction but not considering the well known issue of defining addiction. Furthermore, to my understanding the &quot;progressive nature&quot; of the disease is not referring to the difficulty in quitting but rather the severity of the abuse of the substance.",1412196682

Xen hypervisor does not do \nencryption, neither it deals with any storage subsystems. Also there is \nno explicit guest memory content intermixed with the hypervisor code and \ndata.<p>But one place to see pieces of potentially sensitive data are the Xen \ninternal structures where the guest _registers_ are stored whenever the \nguest execution is interrupted (e.g. because of a trap). These registers \nmight contain e.g. (parts of) keys or other secrets, if the guest was \nexecuting some sensitive crypto operation just before it got interrupted.<p>The vulnerability allows to read only a few kB of the hypervisor memory, \nwith only relative addressing from the emulated APIC registers page, \nwhose address is not known to the attacker. Still, for the exactly \nsame systems (same binaries running, same ACPI tables, etc) it&#x27;s likely \nthat the attacker would be able to guess the address of the APIC page. \nHowever, it is much less probable she would be able to predict what Xen \nstructures are located in the adjacent memory. Much less the attacker \nwould be able to control what structure are located there, as there \ndoesn&#x27;t seem to be many ways of how a malicious HVM might be \nsignificantly affecting the layout of the hypervisor heap (e.g. force \narch_vcpu structures of interesting domains to appear nearby).<p>Nevertheless, it might happen, by pure coincidence, that an arch_vcpu \nstructure with a content of an interesting VM will just happen to be \nlocated adjacently to the emulated APIC page.<p>In that case, the next problem for the attacker would be lack of control \nand knowledge over the target VM execution: even if the attacker were \nsomehow lucky to find the other VM&#x27;s register-holding-structure adjacent \nto the APIC page, it would still be unclear what the target VM was \nexecuting at the time it was suspended and so, whether the registers \nstored in the structure are worthwhile or not.<p>It is thinkable that the attacker might attempt to use some form of a \nheuristic, such as e.g. &quot;if RIP == X, then RAX likely contains (parts \nof) the important key&quot;, hoping that this specific RIP would signify a \nspecific interesting instruction (e.g. part of some crypto library) \nbeing executed while the VM was interrupted, and so the key is to be \nfound in one of the registers.<p>But the attacker&#x27;s memory reading exploit doesn&#x27;t offer a comfort of \nsynchronization, so even though the attacker might be so extremely lucky \nas to find out that<p><pre><code>  *(apic_page + guessed_offset_to_rip) == X \n</code></pre>\n(the \nattacker here assumes the &#x27;guessed_offset_to_rip&#x27; is the distance \nbetween the APIC page and the address where RIP is stored in the \npresumable arch_vcpu structure, that presumably is located adjacently), \nstill there is no guarantees that the next read to<p><pre><code>  *(apic_page + guest_offset_to_rax) \n</code></pre>\nwill return the content of RAX from the same moment \nthat RIP was snapshot (and which the attacker considered interesting).<p>Arguably the attacker might try to fire up the attack continuously, thus \nincreasing chances of success. Assuming this won&#x27;t cause system to crash \ndue to accessing non-mapped memory, this might sound like a somehow good \nstrategy.<p>However, in case of a desktop system like Qubes OS, the attacker has \nvery limited control over other domains. Unlike as in case of attacking \na VM playing a role of a Web server for instance, the attacker probably \nwon&#x27;t be able to force the target VMs to do lots of repeated crypto \noperations, neither choose moments when the target VM traps.<p>It seems like exploiting this bug in an IaaS scenario might be more \npractical, though, as the attacker also has some control of domain \ncreation/termination, so can affect Xen heap to some extent. But on a \nsystem like Qubes OS, it seems unlikely.<p>So, are we doomed? We likely are, but probably not because of this bug.<p>---",1412196206

He and his wife Klára educated their three daughters at home, with chess as the specialist subject. She is the first, and to date, only woman to have surpassed the 2700 Elo rating barrier, reaching a career peak rating of 2735 and peak world ranking of #8, both achieved in 2005.

You wouldn&#x27;t have to have partnerships with nonprofits, you can just mail them checks (they are already set up to receive donations and you don&#x27;t need permission to donate!)<p>The wrinkle with that concept is with pass-through donations, the donor can&#x27;t claim a tax exemption unless the pass-through entity is also classified as such. The way around it is to set up a clearinghouse with a bank that authorizes the pass-through entity to write checks on behalf of members.  Then when you donate your $1 a day, it goes into your bank account, and checks are written from there every month to the charities of your choice. Then you have to figure out pricing and transaction fees with the extra overhead you&#x27;re introducing across sending payments to multiple nonprofits.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not a big deal with $1 a day, but if you want to scale to supporting bigger recurring donations people are going to want a tax exemption.<p>It&#x27;s a good start but I think it needs to be thought out more to become a viable product.",1412195754

Plenty of people &quot;snap out&quot; of schizophrenia, or stop having bipolar symptoms, or have a few depressive episodes over a decade and then never again. We don&#x27;t know why remission happens to some people and not others, but it definitely happens. We just don&#x27;t understand these diseases very well. (I tend to think of depression and bipolar, for example, as symptoms common to multiple diseases.)<p>Time of diagnosis has a major effect on how your disease is modeled (the term I would use instead of &quot;diagnosed&quot;). Technically speaking, if you&#x27;ve ever had a manic episode, you&#x27;re considered to have Bipolar I, the most severe version. If you&#x27;re 28 and had one at 17 and never again... you probably don&#x27;t have Bipolar I. That could be cyclothymia aggravated by a hormonal or sleep disturbance. It could be a one-off. Perhaps out of a fear of getting it wrong, the medical assumption is that a person who&#x27;s had one episode is prone to having more. That might be a good policy for doctors (i.e. don&#x27;t prescribe certain medications to people with histories of depression, or (hypo|)mania) but it&#x27;s not a great model of how mental illness actually works.  Some cases get better with age, and some get worse, and we really don&#x27;t know why.<p>As addiction is a mental illness with behavioral complications, I&#x27;m not surprised. An episode of addiction is something one has to be aware of for one&#x27;s life, but the treatment (don&#x27;t use the drug) is something that, evidently, many people follow perfectly.",1412194141

The maximum loans don&#x27;t appear to take in to account the cost of rent and food/transportation. When+where I went to Uni there were no fees and there was a loan system but the loan didn&#x27;t cover living expenses at all, IIRC it didn&#x27;t even cover my rent (which was as high at the time as London rents; London students had a higher loan rate however to accommodate the high rent). Without relatively well off parents I couldn&#x27;t have attended the high-class institution that I did.<p>The usual answer is to have a part time job - but with lectures starting at 9am every day, finishing labs by about 6pm some days and evenings spent at the library the only time for a job was weekends, which would mean no sport and/or no social life.<p>Anyway, I digress, the UK model seems only really good in theory. Many, many people appear to be at &quot;university&quot; only to avoid work or having been convinced that they &quot;need a Uni education to function as part of society&quot; by political parties who seemingly only wanted to reduce the unemployment figures. Perhaps that&#x27;s a little too cynical but I think there&#x27;s much truth in it too.<p>><i>In this case it doesn&#x27;t seem fair to tax people who are poor to pay for something that is mainly of benefit to the rich.</i> //<p>Educated workers benefit society. They often pay larger tax bills but they also fill roles in fields like medicine, education, engineering, and such that serve society. We need educated people to work and bolster our economy if we want to live in the way we&#x27;ve become accustomed to. We don&#x27;t have to pay but we&#x27;d be foolish IMO not to. Like begrudging doctors their high pay when we as a society <i>en masse</i> appear not to blink at paying footballers, bankers, pop-stars and such many order of magnitude more [I know the economics aren&#x27;t so simple]. The UK is looking to immigration to solve the crisis of lack of skilled workers and at the same time placing financial blocks in front of those that might be able to be home-grown to fill those positions in the future. Maybe that&#x27;s not a bad thing but it seems like one, not least because of the skills drain we place on other countries.",1412193881

You realize that you cannot tie that to skilled immigrants as such right? For e.g. there is family based immigration, diversity visas and what not that could and does result in households with children comprised entirely of immigrants.<p>If one thing is clear - highly skilled immigrants are not taking your welfare. I have lived through it and encountered a lot of high skilled immigrants and have not even an anecdote to refer you to where someone was using welfare.

5548757,comment,5547633,5548105,2,0,potatolicious,,,"Facebook has a substantial (and expanding) presence in NYC. As does Amazon and various other ""tier 1"" tech companies. Tech presence in NYC is exploding in no small part due to Californian (and abroad) companies trying to tap into the local talent pool.<p>While you're condescendingly lecturing others on basic economics, I'd suggest you brush up on what's going on in the tech scene in your own back yard.<p>Your understanding of economics is also overly simplistic and fails to account for the <i>utility</i> of the good or service being sold. Reduction in supply only raises prices if the utility of what's being traded is infinite and there are no substitutes.<p>While there are notable outliers in the tech industry in terms of profit per employee, most software businesses are firmly in the $200-300K range when it comes to revenue per head. This represents the upper bound of how much someone can get paid and still make sense - and both NYC and SF/Bay salaries are already a substantial portion of this figure.<p>A reduction in supply will only result in a rise in salaries until you hit this revenue cap. A <i>continued</i> reduction in supply past this point will result in companies going under as they cannot fulfill labor needs at a price they can afford. This becomes a net negative for the tech industry as the only businesses continuing to employ engineers will be the extreme outliers who can generate highly abnormal revenue numbers per employee. Startup costs will also blow through the roof as the amount of capital required to get a business off the ground explodes. The entire industry suffers as <i>overall employment</i> drops.<p>It's frustrating how many people in our field live in a fantasy land where squeezing hard on the supply side will mean they get rich.<p>> <i>""where the kind of people he wishes to hire want to live.""</i><p>This statement requires more elaboration. I'm in Manhattan, but I also understand that not everyone is like me. To claim that the type of software talent companies are looking for are <i>inevitably</i> urban is entirely misguided. There is no shortage of talented techies who would love nothing more than a house, a lawn, a car, and surfing on weekends.<p>NYC contains a certain demographic of talent that absolutely refuses to live anywhere else - and anyone has the capability would be well-advised to try to tap into it, but it is not the only demographic worth courting.<p>This may seem obvious to outsiders but bears repeating sometimes in the city: New York City, and the ""type"" of people who live there, is not the center of the universe.",1365980263

Ask yourself this question: Why is money valuable. Answer: because I can buy stuff with it. Why can I buy stuff with money? Because it's valuable doh.
This is circular of course, von Mises solved this by turning it into an infinite regress i.e. money is valuable because it was valuable before and moving the chain of reasoning backwards and arriving at the fact that money must have been valuable as a commodity before it became a money. There are certain characteristics that make one commodity more likely than another to become a money and to make a long story short that's why Austrians tend to favour the gold standard (because gold used to be a commodity then turned into a money).
This would suggest bitcoins (and dollars, Euros and so forth) are bubbles. In the case of bitcoins one could even argue that if you could redeem them for the computational input you used when mining there is some commodity behind it.<p>With that and the disclaimer that Austrians are fringe at best and laughed at by many mainstream economists out of the way let's get to my opinion on bitcoins and fiat money.<p>I think that fiat money which is just backed by the word of the government that it's solid somehow works. Why and how I cannot explain nor do I seek to. But essentially I think that's why bitcoins could very well work, too.
The backing is not by any government but rather by ""internet consensus of sorts"". In the information age that could essentially become a more powerful word of mouth backing (if enough people believe it it'll be stable) than the backing of any government.<p>I don't think this is the final iteration of this sort of currency but if we must have a fiat currency by all means please let it be one that allows for the privacy bitcoin has inherently built in.

That being said, I'm pretty sure it was posted with some degree of self-referential humor.<p>The idea of analyzing Valve games critically <i>is</i> pretty good, though. They're one of the few studios which makes games worth analyzing! I'd like to see articles like those.",1197262243
87642,comment,87558,87558,0,0,npk,,,"There is a psuedo-empircal monetary value to enjoying life.  Consider a thought experiment where you plot ""free time"" or ""enjoyable time"" versus ""salary.""  Now consider a job where your enjoyable time is ~ 0, coal miner 100 hours/week, for example.  How much would you need to be paid?  Now maximize the other dimension, how much salary do you need to live, but have a rewarding and stimulating job?<p>For me, the numbers are like, $1M a year and $50K a year.  This means that if I manage to maximize my enjoyment axis, I'm an enjoyment millionare.  My personal goal in life is to be on the manifold that connects those two points.",1197262115
87641,comment,87393,87505,0,0,alxv,,,"You sound like someone who hasn't programmed much in a real-life scenario. Programming is far from being black and white as mathematics can be. From my own experience, programming is a mash of creative arts and psychology with a mathematics flavor . Most of the time, a programmer is just calling other people's API (which is unfortunate, in my humble opinion). So, what is the usual skill usage of a programmer?<p>50% Knowing the programming language you use and its libraries.\n20% Communication.\n10% Debugging efficiently.\n10% Creativity and taste.\n10% Algorithms and mathematics.<p>Of course, these percentages depends on what you're doing -- e.g., a programmer working on a numerical-analysis application will need mathematics much more often than the average web-developer.",1197262010

87639,comment,87522,87522,0,0,jadams,,,"60K seems like good money for an entry-level game programming job. I wouldn't count on any profit sharing or equity to be worth anything. If it is, great, but don't count on it. <p>The game industry is organized kind of like the music industry. Small studios are the bands to the publisher's record companies. Small studios (typically under-funded and over-ambitious) beg the big guys for money to work on projects. They often get screwed. Fight to get your name in the credits of any game you release. OTOH, many many games never get released.<p>Hm. Re-reading your post, it occurs to me that the startup may not be a game company.",1197261975

I could see that happening at a startup trying to take control of a ""secret niche"".<p>I think that's an horrible strategy, it's like a glass ceiling artifically limiting your growth and progress.",1197261777

87633,comment,87558,87558,0,0,jadams,,,"""Love your work"" is often just a way for startups and other small companies to extract unreasonable hours from you, with little payback.<p>I've done the startup thing. I've worked 9-5 er I mean 9-6, oh, wait it was more like 10-7:30. In the end, any job will require you to put up with things you don't like. Obviously, some jobs are a better fit than others.<p>I find the startup smugness naive.",1197261451

Admittedly they were responsible for their own bad decisions and the miscreants here were managers rather than labels, but I still think this story is representative of what the music industry has been and why it's a good thing that it's being crushed.",1197260794

Garbage? $50-75\nFood:  $15 a day x 30 days a month= $450 (This is the low end.  Have you been to Safeway lately?)\ngoing out to eat twice a week for one month? $20 bucks a plate = 160\nCable?  $30-60 a month. or $110 a month Comcast cable/high speed bundle.<p>So, the total for those utilities you're looking at 700-900 a month, unless you can get some of those bundled with your place.<p>Transportation: Car? $100 a month in insurance on the low end.\nCar payment?: 300 a month (low end more for a new car)\nGas? $100-150\nParking???\nTo have a car, you're talking a total of 500-700 a month in expenses.  It'll be cheaper if you take the Muni, of course, but then you have to factor in occasional cab rides and car rentals if you want to go out of the city.<p>So, just in expenses, you're talking $1100 - 1800 a month.  That doesn't include clothes, any bills that you have to pay like credit cards, or school loans.  You will probably have to fly home once or twice a year to visit mom and go to the required family reunion.  If you're like me, when you're living on your own in a large city by yourself, you go out a lot more often, and eat out a lot more than twice a week.  That also doesn't include emergency expenses like parking tickets, car repairs, a new laptop once a year, World of Warcraft subscription, new IPod, etc...<p>You could probably manage on 60k a year, but it's going to be really tight.  And, if you don't watch out, those credit card bills will start creeping up in a hurry.  That's all I'm saying.",1197260246

I've worked at 2 jobs (both enterprise; one was crazy hours and high pay when I was 19 (yup, red bulls all day), and the one I have now is very smooth at 9-5), and I can honestly say that I haven't found any truly interesting projects at either of them. If the answer is yes, and you think they have a good shot at getting rich within 4 years, the $60k should be a small factor in your decision.",1197259493

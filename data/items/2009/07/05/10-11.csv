The relevant equations had already been around for years, waiting for a proper physical interpretation: the time was ripe for it.<p>There probably were a number of authors as prolific and proficient as Shakespeare, that have nevertheless vanished in obscurity, because Shakespeare just happened to get and keep the attention.<p>From not being succesful you can never conclude you have not been working hard enough: someone else may have gotten lucky.",1246790859

So, start with places like India, much of Asia, Latin America, etc.  Just go across them.  Take however long you want.  Learn some langauges.  Do Europe on $20 a day.

688110,comment,687770,687801,0,0,marvin,,,"Hobby pilot here. This is one of my pet topics. A ""flying car"" is like ""land-running sailboat"" - a ""flying car"" wouldn't be anything like a car, but would serve the same purposes. Journalists always make this mistake.<p>Möller's approach won't work because their design uses too much energy. We need a design that combines the great fuel efficiency of a good airplane with the VTOL capability of a helicopter. This could be done.<p>Some of the remaining issues which make this difficult are, in short:<p><pre><code>  Mechanical reliability (you can't just pull over if the engine fails)\n  Existing regulation (airspaces are organized manually, rigidly and labor-intensively)\n  Liability (one lawsuit after a crash and a new company is history)\n  Investment (aviation is really expensive and no one wants to touch it)\n  Weather (the plane must work in clouds and darkness)\n  Training (landing a plane is a little harder than driving a car)\n</code></pre>\nI think the wheather issue cannot be budged in the forseeable future - sometimes it's just not safe to fly. So these hypothetical machines can't replace cars.<p>In my opinion, most of the problems in this field are related to the US political climate for aviation. Due to airline disasters, <i>all</i> of aviation is kept to a really strict safety standard, and any failure can and will be sued to oblivion privately. The problems that these ""flying car"" companies are actually shared by <i>every</i> company that tries to make progress in aviation. If you do anything that doesn't use 1960s technology, you have mountains of certification and bureaucracy before you. For this reason, most of the really cool planes are certified as experimental designs, and you have to assemble them yourself.<p>The existing air traffic control system employs thousands of people and is very resistant to change. It is very labor- and training-intensive, both on the part of the controller and the pilot. But the part of it that doesn't involve airliners could be automated if it wasn't for the culture of excessive safety.<p>I actually wrote a comprehensive article about this last summer, but I'm really self-conscious and didn't publish it. Pehaps I should.",1246790099

The poll doesn't have to be as USA-centric as you make it :-)<p>On a sidenote, At her funeral a few years ago I found out that in 1908, at the age of 11, she was put on a train from Germany to Denmark with noone to pick her up at the other end. Her German family was in extreme poverty and gave her a one way ticket to another country, hoping that someone would pick her up and care for her when she arrived in Denmark.<p>Noone did, so for the first few years she took care of herself, and was eventually adopted by a farming family where she got work. She grew up, had lots of kids, was a great mother and granny and was always there for people in hardship. Guess she knew what real hardship was.<p>Stoic as she was she never told anyone aboout it, and it was only revealed at her funeral. She lived to be 93.<p>Tough lady.",1246789220

But it varies so much its hard to say exactly.  I am very much a euromut.  I wish I'd looked into it more while more of the earlier generations were still alive.<p>My grandfather on my father's side descended from a line of engineers through North Carolina (and was much smarter than me).  My mother's side were mostly farmers until a couple generations ago.<p>Overall, its such a mix that it would be impossible to pin down what nations and tribes I am composed of, short of DNA analysis - which I have thought of doing - at <a href=""https://www.23andme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.23andme.com/</a> $400 is a bit out of my price range at the moment, though.

If you don't know what other things than work you could spend your time on, you either lack imagination, are passionately attracted to your kind of work or are socially inept.

It could mean getting to know interesting people, mastering one of three hundred million practical skills (one of which is making money), having sex, doing dangerous things (dangerous is fun, incidentally: skydiving, river kayaking), overcoming personal barriers, learning stuff you haven't learned before, taking a second degree, discovering something no one else knows etc etc etc. If you wanted me to detail the list, I could go on forever.<p>I'm not telling anyone how to live their lives, but if you are bored and don't see any options, you have issues.

MIDI ended up being the easiest thing to implement as a sort of proof of concept, but I am completely open to (in fact, am really hoping for) a wide array of music generators at the disposal of Alda&#x27;s syntax. The next major milestone will be waveform synthesis, probably via a Java library like Minim (my original idea was to control Supercollider via Overtone, via Alda, but it seems there are too many setup issues involved, when compared to a self-contained Java library that I can use from Clojure).<p>Being able to generate code in other audio programming languages is also a thought I&#x27;ve had -- if not for Alda, then for a spinoff project. The primary thing that inspired me to create Alda was that I love the unbounded potential behind these more robust languages like ChucK and Csound, but the syntax of these languages could be greatly simplified and adapted for use by composers with little-to-no programming experience. I guess my point is that Alda prioritizes aesthetics and simplicity over being a Turing-complete language that lets you do everything you want.",1441576530

The system clearly needs more public defenders.<p>Legal research does play a key component when it comes to the sentencing of offenders. Two offenders can be charged with the same crime however it could have occurred in two entirely different circumstances with the offenders having starkly different backgrounds and motivations. Due to these differences, public defenders <i>should</i> do a deep dive in research in order to provide proper representation rather than relying on only their own personal list of applicable cases.

10179174,comment,10177477,10178387,0,0,scottdw2,,,"Are you using Node.js or Java for your Lambda function?<p>If you are using &quot;Node.js&quot;, you may be seeing slow times if you are not calling &quot;context.done&quot; in the correct place, or if you have code paths that don&#x27;t call it.<p>Not calling context.done could either cause Node.js to exit, either because the node event loop is empty, or because the code times out, and Lambda kills it.<p>When node exits, the container shuts down, which means Lambda can&#x27;t re-use the container for the next invoke and needs to create a new one. The &quot;cold-start&quot; path is much slower than the &quot;warm-start&quot; path. When Lambda is able to re-use containers, invokes will be much faster than when it can&#x27;t.<p>Also, how are you initializing your connection to DDB? Is it happening inside your Lambda function? If you either move it to the module initializer (for Node), or to a static constructor (for Java), you may also see speed improvements.<p>If you initiate a connection to DDB inside the Lambda function, that code will run on every invoke. However, if you create it outside the Lambda function (again in the Module initializer or in a static constructor) then that code will only run once, when the container is spun up. Subsequent invokes that use the same container will be able to re-use the HTTP connection to DDB, which will improve invoke times.<p>Also, you may want to consider increasing the amount of RAM allocated to your Lambda function. The &quot;memory size&quot; option is badly named, and it controls more than just the maximum ram you are allowed to use. It also controls the proportion of CPU that your container is allowed to use. Increasing the memory size will result in a corresponding (linear) increase in CPU power.<p>One final thing to keep in mind when scaling a Lambda function is that Lambda mainly throttles on the number of concurrent requests, not on the transactions per second (TPS). By default Lambda will allow up to 100 concurrent requests.<p>If you want a maximum limit greater than that you do have to call us, but we can set the limit fairly high for you.<p>The scaling is still dynamic, even if we have to raise your upper limit. Lambda will spin up and spin down servers for you, as you invoke, depending on actual traffic.<p>The default limit of 100 is mainly meant as safety limit. For example, unbounded recursion is a mistake we see frequently. Having default throttles in place is good protection, both for us and for you. We generally want to make sure that you really want to use a large number of servers before we go ahead and allocate them to you.<p>For example, a lot of folks use Lambda with S3 for generating thumbnail images, sometimes in several different sizes. A common mistake some folks make when implementing this for the first time is to write back to the same s3 bucket they are triggering off of, without filtering the generated files from the trigger. The end result is an exponential explosion of Lambda requests. Having a safety limit in place helps with that.<p>In any case, if you are having trouble getting Lambda to scale, I&#x27;m happy to try and help.",1441576173

Eventual consistency can help you scale, but reasoning about it is really hard.<p>In some sense caching as described by OP is a tool to implement CAP theorem tradeoffs, and Eric Brewer described the reality of trading off the C (consistency) for A/P (availability/partition-tolerance) better than I ever could:<p><pre><code>  Another aspect of CAP confusion is the hidden cost of\n  forfeiting consistency, which is the need to know the\n  system’s invariants. The subtle beauty of a consistent\n  system is that the invariants tend to hold even when the\n  designer does not know what they are. Consequently, a\n  wide range of reasonable invariants will work just fine.\n  Conversely, when designers choose A, which requires\n  restoring invariants after a partition, they must be\n  explicit about all the invariants, which is both\n  challenging and prone to error.

10179114,comment,10174624,10176409,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Everything you said has no bearing on my point, which maybe I should&#x27;ve stated more strictly: &#x27;Japan had no military capacity to win the war or subject other countries to its will&#x27;.<p>The fact they still had the capacity to fight to the last man and that this would be bloody is a truism that doesn&#x27;t need to be stated. But my point is that they (1) had no capacity beyond their borders and (2) their defeat was inevitable. In that respect, the USSR&#x27;s decision to go to war, too, changed nothing for them. That&#x27;s my point. An anecdote about how a lot of purple hearts were printed because the end was expected to be bloody doesn&#x27;t change that point. Of course it made Japan&#x27;s case even more hopeless (in particular because the Soviet&#x27;s would likely invade Manchuria, one of the remaining places for Japan to gain natural resources, although even those were effectively cut off as Japan&#x27;s merchant fleet had been decimated).<p>For example the US Strategic Bombing Survey established by the secretary of war (1940-1945) established:\n> Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey&#x27;s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.<p>Eisenhower says:\n> During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.<p>And he was joined by other generals, e.g. McArthur. The guy in charge of the , LeMay, who of course famously firebombed Japan in a way much more destructive than the nuclear bombs (death tolls between 200k and 500k, and destroying nearly half of all built up areas of 66 cities) who opined he had committed war crimes and that he&#x27;d be tried as a war criminal had the US lost the war somehow, said<p>> The atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all.<p>Fleet admiral Nimitz said:<p>> The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan.<p>Fleet Admiral Leafy said:\n> The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.<p>The fact that the end of the war might&#x27;ve have involved more fighting and that some campaigns had been planned that would have been bloody (again, an invasion wasn&#x27;t the only scenario accounted for, the nuclear bombs proved at the very least that), doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Japan had in essence already been defeated, whether they&#x27;d surrendered or not, whether the last mile would be painful or not.<p>> In fact, if anything, I would expect the causality ran the other way.<p>Your statement just supports the idea I raised, which is that the US threw the bombs knowing the USSR would at some point shift its focus towards Japan. I&#x27;m not saying that the US decided within 24 hours &#x27;oh, the USSR attacks Japan, never woulda imagined that, took us by complete surprise, let&#x27;s quickly drop the bomb&#x27;. Of course not, and of course that wouldn&#x27;t make sense as you stated given the first bomb was dropped before that. My point is that with the war in Europe roundly settled, the USSR would very likely at one point have looked to exert its influence south of its borders, the region of Japanese influence, the US knew this and in fact the US was aware that the USSR delayed surrender proposals to make itself ready to shift its forces to the east. Given the above statements by top-ranked military personnel it&#x27;s sensible to say that Japan had already been defeated, was dependent on imports, had no merchant fleet and barely a naval fleet that couldn&#x27;t be refueled anyway. Thus an atomic bomb wasn&#x27;t required to defeat Japan, unless you were on a timeline because at some point the USSR would shift its attention. The fact the USSR did shift immediately after the first bomb was dropped proves exactly their interest in being there for the end and playing a role in the peace process and aftermath. And indeed the very fact the USSR had the ability to invade quite quickly (much quicker than the Japanese had expected the Americans to invade), perhaps even caused the US to choose targets that&#x27;d show maximum damage (outside of Tokyo which was ruled out for obvious reasons), as opposed to using multiple nuclear weapons &#x27;for show&#x27;. After all, the US would have the third bomb ready later that month, and the 4th in August, and others following, and was not at threat by Japan. Given a few months they could&#x27;ve continued to bomb with impunity, drop nuclear weapons for show with impunity, block off Japan&#x27;s trade with impunity, and be strengthened by their Soviet allies.<p>> As for the threat of a divided Japan, exactly whose navy would have deposited enough Red Army troops on the Home Islands for that to be a concern?<p>The same fleet that allowed the 16th Army (100k strong) invade Sakhalin, or the fleet that facilitated the invasion of the Kuril islands, or the planned Russian invasion of Hokkaido which never happened due to the surrender. Don&#x27;t take it by the way as a divided Japan in terms of two different countries on a militarised border like say Korea, but rather one like a divided Europe, in which the USSR has half of the influence. Unlike in Europe however, the USSR didn&#x27;t acquire as much influence in Japan and Japan turned into a very strong US/Western ally, and one can argue sensibly that the atomic bombs may have helped the US in that regard, and that in turn this may have inspired the US to use the bombs in spite of a resolution to the war that would&#x27;ve taken longer.",1441575187

10179064,comment,10177775,10178968,0,0,jleyank,,,"This might be useful for postdocs, but remember that the PhD degree is a research degree.  Therefore, academia has to have some kind of research available for people to do.  Assuming that the typical PhD in Chemistry anyway takes 4-6 years based on topic and level of support.  The first two years are coursework and other prep work for entering the actual research process.  Semester #5 is the prelim, which is the entry exam.  The next 2-3 semesters are the golden time when other interests fall away, work progresses and the material that justifies the PhD gets done.  After that comes writing up and doing whatever odds and ends the boss wants done or wants done to expand/round-out the dissertation or whatever.<p>It&#x27;s possible that lab-based PhD&#x27;s take longer because the reactions have to work and yield the desired product.  Also, a lot will depend on how often the student&#x27;s in the lab (reactions have to be worked up, machine time has to be found, etc).  Run 2x vs 1x daily has a direct impact on time-in-process.  Fortunately, the non-lab PhD&#x27;s can work pretty much anywhere as modern laptops are either sufficient or work well as front-ends to compute resources.<p>The end result of this is 3-7 papers, which will be &quot;stapled together&quot; to make the dissertation.  The work has to be &quot;novel&quot;, and some people are lucky/good enough to produce something that&#x27;s a win.  Note that some of the best ideas in the field (possibly any field) come from 2-4th year grad students who don&#x27;t know or care they&#x27;re wrong...  Oh, they might produce some code throughout this process, or some groups maintain a code base that pretty much every student contributes to (such as QM groups).<p>Coming out of this process, the newly-minted PhD is now capable of doing an academic postdoc to either round out their training or start the path towards an academic position.  Or, they can do an industrial postdoc or go directly into pharma or biotech (or the various support companies doing chemistry, software or whatever supporting these two areas).  Think of the PhD as a union card, certifying the holder as being (vaguely?) capable of independent, organized work.  Lab PhD&#x27;s typically post-doc with the &quot;other half&quot; of their discipline: come out as a synthetic PhD, go work for a natural product group, etc.<p>Once in pharma, they face a 3-6 year period where they&#x27;re to learn various aspects of the medicinal chemistry process.  They start as pairs of hands and end up, hopefully, as somebody who can run with at least part of a drug design or development project.  Academia, for the most part, lacks the money or interest for this part of the training process - it&#x27;s applied research with an eye towards the big return, and IP issues prevent publishing until projects die or go into the market.<p>I suspect physics PhD&#x27;s might have similar timelines, possibly delayed if they have to build their apparatus (or wait for time at CERN).  I&#x27;ve heard that UK PhD&#x27;s get through quicker, and it&#x27;s possible European PhD&#x27;s get through a little slower than North American due to a better funding environment?  I&#x27;ve no understand of the schedule for things like Biology or Medical-related PhD&#x27;s as that&#x27;s totally outside my experience (personal and professional).  Might be slower as the mice/cells/whatever can up and die on them.<p>To close this spiel, while research labs have always provided a place for PhD&#x27;s to go work (and still do), there&#x27;s always problems due to security, funding, etc.  If there was more money available, we&#x27;d end up with a better crop of postdocs and probably young professors with better home lives but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the trend of things right now.  Given all the uncertainty over funding, finding a position, avoiding layoff/outsoucing/offshoring, ...

It&#x27;s not so much a downside of caching as a misuse: Application-level caches should never cache local data. Cache network responses. Cache the results of computations. Don&#x27;t cache files or disk reads. Operating systems already implement disk caches, and they do a better job of it than you. That&#x27;s in addition to a modern computer&#x27;s numerous hardware caches. For example, take this code:<p><pre><code>    ...\n    FILE *fp = fopen(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);\n    char dest;\n    int bytes_read = fread(&dest, 1, 1, fp);\n    putchar(dest);\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nThink of how many caches likely contain the first byte of example.txt. There&#x27;s the internal cache on the hard disk or SSD. There&#x27;s the OS&#x27;s filesystem cache in RAM. There&#x27;s your copy (dest) in RAM, and also in L3, L2, and L1 cache. (These aren&#x27;t inclusive on modern Intel CPUs. I&#x27;m just talking about likelihood.) Implementing your own software RAM cache puts you well into diminishing returns. The increased complexity simply isn&#x27;t worth it.",1441574302

But it&#x27;s kind of illusory to say that&#x27;s different from what the system was like in the 1920&#x27;s and 1930&#x27;s. The first Social Security check wasn&#x27;t cut until 1940, and Medicare didn&#x27;t exist until the 1960&#x27;s. Prior to that the bottom 90% paid for old age and disabled care directly by supporting their elderly parents or disabled family members directly instead of indirectly funding social security and medicare. A lot of the &quot;growth&quot; in government tax burden is those programs moving what was previously a household economy onto the government ledger.<p>And note that the article talks about federal tax receipts, not state taxes.  Direct state tax burden isn&#x27;t all that different from what it was in the 1930&#x27;s: <a href=""http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/Chart2_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/...</a>. And I assure you state property tax collectors were not on the honor system even back then.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting to look at where the money goes. Total federal + state spending was about 10% of GDP in 1930. It&#x27;s now almost 35% of GDP. That&#x27;s almost entirely attributable to two things: defense spending (3-5% of GDP) and transfer payments (20% of GDP): <a href=""http://fortune.com/2012/08/27/wheres-all-that-government-spending-really-going"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2012/08/27/wheres-all-that-government-spe...</a>.

10179008,comment,10177623,10177623,0,0,SagelyGuru,,,"The article is written from an English perspective. It does follow very closely the usual worn out consensus of recent decades that it is mandatory to further increase the numbers of graduates, despite their growing personal indebtedness.<p>Apparently, according to the author, this is all justified by the fact that graduates have lower unemployment rates than non-graduates.<p>I think it is time to start questioning this dogma. It is the more able half of the population that is typically selected for entrance by the UK universities (and so it should be). Surely, it would be very surprising indeed, if they were not also the more employable half, regardless of whether they study or not? The content of their studies is increasingly irrelevant anyway, as is confirmed by the fact that &quot;more than half of graduates are overqualified for their jobs&quot;. That means they are the more able people competing for the same old unqualified jobs and so, of course, they win.<p>In these circumstances, the &quot;studies&quot; of ever increasing proportion of population are nothing more than a way of transferring more of their future incomes to the bankers. It is an interesting &quot;coincidence&quot; that the drive for expansion of student numbers coincided with the introduction of the american model of personal loans for education and ever increasing fees.",1441573601

Large brands need to protect their position in the market, smaller brands need to drive sales.<p>My guess about your original comment is that you were exposed to Target back to school commercials recently and so they appeared like a larger advertiser than amazon or walmart who focus less on back to school.<p>The reality though is that advertising comes in many shapes and sizes, and is bought in many different ways. Limiting this to direct media buying is a little deceptive as some brands engage in PR and other strategies that serve the same goal as advertising, without paying a publisher for placement.<p>It isn&#x27;t an equal comparison to use direct ad buying as a barometer to prove that advertising just shifts demand and doesn&#x27;t create it, when PR and other marketing strategies are arguably the same exact thing, just bought in a different way.",1441573587

We&#x27;ve already solved important relevant problems, such as how to construct an arbitrarily large, near-infallible memory.<p>2- It&#x27;s hard to see how a first-stage AI would be incapable of designing a better one. Let&#x27;s pretend that the first-stage AI was equivalent to an IQ 120 person intellectually (reasoning horsepower). However, that IQ 120 intelligence would be backed up by a very fast, effectively limitless memory. It would never need to sleep, eat, or be distracted by emotion. Instead, it could monomaniacally concentrate on designing a better AI, possibly for hundreds of years. Also, in principle, it could be a team of 100 (or 1000, or...) \nAIs working on the problem cooperatively.<p>3- The concern regarding the extermination of humanity is secondary. Are humans out to genocide ants? Not really, but we do wipe them out when they pose a problem. That might apply to an IQ 1000 AI as well.<p>4- Perhaps the bigger problem is the effect of knowing there is a superior intelligence on the human psyche. Plus, it&#x27;s impossible for us to know the thoughts of an IQ 250+ AI. What does a dog know of human thought? What if the AI decides that the best use for all the available raw resources of the Earth is to create an IQ 10000 AI?<p>5- Electronic processes are already known to be faster than chemical ones. Nerve impulses travel at around 80 MPH. Electrons in wires travel at 90% the speed of light. I expect electronic AIs to generally be much faster thinkers than humans, and to have amazing reaction times.<p>6- &quot;This super-AI is actually a computer.&quot; You&#x27;re confusing the hardware with the software. Your brain is actually a mass of organic chemicals. So?<p>The idea of the singularity revolves around the unknowability of what a high-IQ AI would think and do.",1441573523

For every marketing or advertising craftsman out there who builds something that works, gathers useful data, and interprets that data honestly, there are probably 20 people who have no clue and just keep churning out the same stuff because they don&#x27;t have anything else to offer.</i><p>Let me share a personal anecdote from watching a social media marketing company at works.<p>These marketing people got contracts to do brand/site/service promotion on everyone&#x27;s favourite social networking and image collecting sites. They wrote many posts, made interesting graphics, etc. Generally did a good, honest work at that. Then every month they had to write reports detailing the effectiveness of their efforts. The way they did it was like this:<p>1) gather metrics provided by social media platforms they used<p>2) put them in a DOC file<p>3) start with the conclusion that they did their job well and helped the marketed company tremendously<p>4) invent some plausible-sounding reasons to connect the data from 1) to conclusion in 3)<p>And mind you, this wasn&#x27;t intentional dishonesty. They simply have <i>no fucking clue</i> about the meaning of the data, or what can (and can not) be reasonably inferred from it, so they don&#x27;t even try. They don&#x27;t even know what they don&#x27;t know. But their clients don&#x27;t know anything too; it&#x27;s basically both sides not knowing what those colorful graphs and tables of numbers mean and bullshitting one another without even realizing it.<p>I guess one can&#x27;t generalize from one example, but mind this: social media marketing companies are not staffed by math PhDs, they&#x27;re staffed by social sciences undergrads who decided that, given current state of the job market, learning Photoshop is better than working at McDonalds. They may be good at making interesting content, but they have <i>zero</i> necessary knowledge for getting right conclusions from data.",1441573476

Even an EC2 small instance is overkill (both in computing resources and in price) for many websites.<p>However if you do need lots of resources then the cost effectiveness of VPSes - or any virtualized system for that matter - goes down the drain quickly. For high-traffic websites nothing compares to good old dedicated servers. The pricing difference between a dedicated server and EC2/Linode/etc can be as much as 5x for the same resources.<p>Linode is also a bad choice if you need a lot of disk space, and with ""a lot"" I mean >100 GB.

1801651,comment,1801334,1801557,0,0,citricsquid,,,"I signed up in September 2009 and I'm still <i>technically</i> a customer but I won't be once renewal rolls around.<p>The problems are numerous, the management are great, they really care (Nick, Terry etc) <i>but</i> the product and support team are pitiful. I assume as you're a customer you've got access to the customer forum? Take a look at the problems people face. vps.net is great when it works, but the second something goes wrong I've found myself nothing but screwed and personally how the system and team handle when things go wrong is what matters most.<p>""Self healing with automatic failover"" is a joke. I've had 2 periods of 10 hour+ downtime on tiny servers, I've also had numerous ""small"" downtimes that lasted between 30 minutes and 2 hours. The reasons for these range from technicians making mistakes (""replaced ram incorrectly"") to the technology just not being able to cope.<p>I <i>wish</i> I could stick with vps.net, their flexibility isn't beaten by anyone but the stability and support is incredibly poor. If I were to totally ignore any times my server has been rebooted because of me (so assume 1 year = 1 year of uptime) the longest my server(s -- I used to run multiple with them) have been online is 90 days. They can't go 90 days without a problem, where problems range from 30 minutes to 10 hours.<p>The last straw for me was my server being inaccessible for almost 90 minutes, the reason? I had been nullrouted and that isn't the bad part... I submitted a support ticket explaining that my server was down (I originally logged in to the control panel after I couldn't get in via SSH and saw many disk errors) I got a canned ""reboot plz"" response, I sent a reply saying that didn't work, he replied ""I can connect from here!"" so I replied ""Well I can't!"" and included a link that showed it wasn't just me (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/NtXi9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/NtXi9.jpg</a>) then his next reply ""oh, it appears you've been nullrouted!"" (this was an hour after I first submitted my ticket) so I reply asking when it'll be back, they ignore me and then 15 minutes later it's accessible again and the ticket was closed...<p>...it doesn't end there. I head over to the customer forum and ask if anyone else is experiencing the same, surprise surprise another customer says ""hey I'm experiencing the same!"" so we compare IPs, he's on the same (subnet?) IP part as me, xx.xx.xx.<i></i> (where <i></i> is our specific parts and xx is the same) so he then submits a support ticket about it. So specific to this incident: Support are not told when blocks are put in place, support don't proceed to contact all the other customers with the same problem when it <i>is</i> resolved and they don't offer any sort of ""sorry"" explanation. So either support doesn't have the facility to check for incidents specific to a client (why not?) or they just don't bother.<p>Anyway yes, that's just one incident but it was the final straw. vps.net have always been good on the customer relations side with Nick always talking to customers, but the product is poor (have a SAN die and then enjoy the wait time while it ""self heals"") and the support is just as bad. I'd love to pass issues off as one time, or things that will get better, but after an entire year of seeing it remain poor I'm finally moving on and it isn't just me, the customer forum is full of issues.<p>oh and don't even get me started on their inability to communicate, you'd think a product aimed at people with <i>important</i> things would have people monitoring the network and hardware, but apparently not, because it often takes <i>at least</i> 30 minutes for them to notify people of issues in progress via status.vps.net (which FYI a bunch of customers had to hammer them to get online, which they still don't publicise).<p><a href=""http://www.vps.net/forum/customers-forums/clients-only-forum-private/3471-what-happen-to-slc-c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vps.net/forum/customers-forums/clients-only-forum...</a> < A group of clients down, Managing Director says he's going to ""look into it"" and confirms there is an issue. He has to <i>look into it</i>? Don't they, you know, monitor? The problem? Licensing issue, a licensing issue took down hundreds of servers for over 4 hours? It's a joke.

Broken promises.<p>Edit: I didn't realise how long this had become, apologies. I'm just very frustrated that I've stuck with them for so long (I was considering leaving after 3 months of nothing but pain) and they <i>still</i> suck.<p>Edit edit: I figured an example of the horrible support where it caused substantial downtime would be good. Back story: Server went down, checked the client forums and many others had the same problems, after an hour Nick (MD) said via Twitter that anyone still down should contact support, so I'd <i>already</i> been down for an hour:<p>09:34 EDT Submit ticket, say that my server is still down and this ticket is as instructed via Twitter.<p>09:38 EDT Reply from support, ""Will check this and update as soon as possible"".<p>10:07 EDT I replied asking where my update is, explain that I've now been down for 2 hours.<p>10:39 EDT I finally get a reply saying that my server is queued for being brought online<p>11:46 EDT Server still down I ask what's going on...<p>13:36 EDT Still no reply, server still down.<p>19:40 EDT Finally a reply from the MD (Nick) saying that my server is now back online.<p>So as you can see, between ""Your server is now queued to come online"" and the MD replying, I got nothing, all the while my server was down. It's laughably bad, especially because this is one of the many terrible instances with support I've had.",1287355596

Health information seems like a massive market, and this seems like unique data. (Think about financial consumers who care about health data in addition to the pharmas.) I'll assume your app scales so that you get critical mass of input, but once you have that in your sights, here's how we constructed our information business.<p>In my experience, the best information businesses are founded on a core of primary research - data that you find/generate that no one else has. Once you build that database, you build the products. You might be surprised, but here's what many information products look like - I'm a fan of doing it in this order:<p>1. A big honking CSV file of the primary data. For customers that have their own models, which your early adopters will likely have. Ours did.<p>2. A CSV file of derivative analytics (the output of your prediction tools perhaps?). For customers who want your algorithmic take on the underlying data.<p>3. Reports (manually written). People buy your analysis of the data. We found a majority of the potential market doesn't want Tools or data files (even if they're Wall Street ""quants""). They just want answers - and by virtue of having the data, you're an instant expert. Reports have the nice benefit of being A) tangible B) easy to consume and C) subscribe-able (repeat revenue!) They have a bonus of being delicious chum for the media sharks.<p>4. Reports (automated, for scale). Subscribers get the latest insights each week, month, etc. Best not to automate until you see which of #3 are most popular.<p>5. Now come the technology Tools. #3 and #4 above will be excellent test beds for your prediction tools. Doing it in this order, you won't have to build any front end applications until you understand what predictions people pay for. One way to build a tools-based product line is to give the tech away for free and have the customer subscribe to the latest data.<p>You might also find that a great consumer-facing website is powerful for the information business. We don't have those skills in our company, but have found that when we pull it off even a little, institutional buyers begin as personal, individual consumers. A great consumer facing site/app is a perfect way to reach them.<p>rock on.",1287353819

1801581,comment,1801434,1801434,0,0,toast76,,,"The answer is quite simple. Never do a variable amount of work for a fixed price. Billing on ""estimates"" is a risky proposition for both sides, and you need to explain this to your client. They may win sometimes, but you may also win. Explain to them that they may end up paying double the actual cost if you're forced to estimate high, and they'll quickly work with you to refine the pricing.<p>Some clients will try get this past you by requesting a ""quote estimate"" instead. Which is them saying, ""we will pay less if it's less, but we won't pay more"". I have one client who does this constantly. The best way around it is to specify EXACTLY what you will provide them, and EXACTLY what they must provide you. If anything changes, it's a variation and you quote the change before doing any more work. They'll soon get the picture that uncertain work leads to uncertain pricing...no matter how they try to do it.<p>If you are uncertain as to how long the work will take, you need to improve your estimation skills. Sorry! Software engineering is most definitely NOT a chaotic activity. Every task can be broken down into smaller quantifiable components. Estimate on the components to come up with your quote. If you can't accurately estimate how long something will take, then it won't matter how you quote, you will eventually lose out.<p>I use the (average of best case + worst case) + slippage (15-20%) method which serves me pretty well.

- There is a ""Widget Gallery"" which has high level widgets.
- You can create a custom widget by selecting something and then reusing it.<p>Thanks for helping me understand how important having templates/presets it.",1287353200

Since then, ""rails"" trended the same as ""ruby on rails"" at every point in the last six years.  Right now, the search volume for ""rails"" is still trending 10 points higher on the graph than it did before RoR came out; to put that into perspective, searches for the full name ""Ruby on Rails"" have been less than 10 points since the start of 2008.  All this indicates is that people have learned they can get good results by typing ""rails"" instead of the full name.<p>I want to add that it's possible that nearly all correlation between ""rails"" and ""ruby on rails"" is due to the possibility that google double-counts ""ruby on rails"" searches as ""rails"" since that word appears in the full name.  However, the 10 point increase in ""rails"" still trends 5 points higher than the 5 point increase in ""ruby on rails"" during the same period of first release in 2005 to now in 2010, which is double.  But anyway, the point isn't that my stats are any better; the point is to demonstrate that it's hard to make an inference based on two keywords, and even harder to predict what will happen based on this information, even if it was accurate.<p>No news here except that there are many MVC web frameworks these days.",1287352986

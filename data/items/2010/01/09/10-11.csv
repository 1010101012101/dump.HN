Imagine, if you will, that a person could write something in French and someone else could read it as if it were Italian, Spanish or Romanian without a hiccup. I18n would be a much easier task if European languages were so encoded, no doubt, but literacy itself would become a much more remarkable accomplishment.<p>(1)A large number of Chinese characters are composed of a syllable radical which originally acted as a guide to pronunciation (say, ""ma"") along with a context indicator which would tell the reader which of the various ""ma"" syllables was being used. In the original written language, it probably made perfect sense, but language drift over time have left the system essentially arbitrary in most modern Chinese languages.<p>[EDIT -- tried to use an asterisk there, forgetting that paired asterisks result in italics.]",1263034580

I can fairly easily recognize the writing styles of several dozen of my friends, and I'm not married to any of them.<p>In any given essay/blog of that length, without employing <i>deliberate</i> obfuscation, someone looking for it would likely be able to spot a saying/phrase/crutch word that could identify the author.<p>The excessive use of the thesaurus is a pretty solid indicator that the author wrote their original draft, then went through and replaced words and phrases with ones of similar meaning.<p>For example, I wrote the above naturally, without trying to hide my writing style.  Glance over the above and you'll probably notice; I have a habit of using indecisive adjectives in statements where I'm not confident that I'm 100% accurate.  (Hell, I reflexively did so while writing the sentence talking about the habit!)<p>That kind of thing can be as good as a signature.

1041306,comment,1038459,1038951,0,0,fdb,,,"As one of the people behind NodeBox, I'd love to know why you think this is unfortunate. We have been working hard on an application that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac, and a blanket statement like ""unfortunately Java"" is a bit frustrating.<p>As graphic designers we are really sensitive to awkward Java applications that look out of place on Mac or Windows. We are trying to find the right look that works on every platform. We discovered that this has more to do with an attention to detail than the underlying technology. As an example, look at a ""Mac-like"" application iTunes, iPhoto, iCal or Garageband: none of them use the standard aqua buttons in the main interface, instead opting for custom bitmap buttons.<p>For us, the choices are really down to Qt or Java. We need a solid graphics layer that provides the same results on every platform. Java's 2d graphics does this, and it has native back-ends (Quartz). Also, by using Java, we can speed up a lot of the Python code without resorting to hunting memory bugs in C++.<p>Lastly, I discovered at Pycon 2009 that Jython really has become a first-class citizen, officially supported by people like Guido. It also does away with the GIL.<p>I knew the Java argument would come up eventually: I'm surprised it took so long. However, it doesn't come up with people using the software: our users don't realize/care that we use Jython. Instead they're just happy they can use NodeBox on Windows.",1263032259

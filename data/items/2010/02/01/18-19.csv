1093106,comment,1092758,1092758,0,0,MrSartorial,,,"I think this is a challenge that a lot of startups encounter. I've certainly encountered it so far. I think the breakthrough for me was when my dad (good 'ol parents) asked me to describe what I wanted to do in one sentence. Once I did, it became clear how to best focus on what I was trying to accomplish, who I wanted to reach, and how I wanted them to benefit. Sometimes giving yourself some solid guidelines will free you more than anything else. Above all I find that you have to maintain focus. As an entrepreneur I find that you will pick up on many problems that can be solved, and many ways to do so. You have to pick the most important problem to solve, and the way that will solve it the greatest amount is the first one to pursue. My thoughts, from someone that is still learning a lot...",1265050740

That is, declare that all Lincoln pennies currently in circulation are now worth 5¢ alongside the nickels (and then remove the nickels from circulation as a natural phaseout).  Subsequent mintings of the penny would actually say ""FIVE CENTS"" but the old pennies would also be worth 5¢.<p>Advantages: The five cent penny would cost less than five cents to mint.  The expensive nickel would no longer be minted.  Immediate but relatively contained inflation that puts the ""printed"" money in the hands of the poorest people (who would have more pennies as a percentage of their cash on hand than richer folks)---a lightweight form of stimulus.  Brings pennies back into circulation because they're not worthless anymore.<p>Disadvantage: vending machines wouldn't accept pennies for the new amount, but most don't accept them at all so that's less of a problem than it might be.",1265050624

1092979,comment,1091814,1092366,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> Of all laws that one could choose to _not_ obey, the traffic laws are among the poorest choices.<p>I respectfully disagree. While I try to drive legally, as a pragmatic measure because I value my driving licence, I have less respect for traffic laws than just about any other kind.<p>Let me be very clear: I am all in favour of promoting safe and considerate driving, and I have nothing against punishing those who do drive dangerously or inconsiderately, including punishing them severely if this is proportionate to the likely consequences of their actions. I just don't feel that the kind of arbitrary, black-and-white laws that we have today are really helping that goal.<p>In my country, the speed limit on our fastest roads is 70mph. If you do 71mph, even on clear roads with a well maintained vehicle on Christmas morning, then technically you are a criminal. On the other hand, if you drive past a school at 29mph, in the wet, just as the kids are coming out at the end of the day, with parked cars obscuring your view everywhere, then you are unlikely to be prosecuted unless you actually hit someone, because you're under the 30mph limit. The idea that your driving might be considered dangerous (and this might reasonably be argued in court) if you're not breaking some arbitrary technical limit doesn't seem to occur to prosecutors, and the penalties for generic dangerous driving type offences are often laughable; you can get less penalty for killing someone through absurdly dangerous driving than you can for many much less serious crimes not involving the use of a car.<p>Similar problems apply with:<p>- banning hand-held mobile phones (yes, they're dangerous, but so are hands-free kits to almost the same degree),<p>- drunk driving (more than a certain blood alcohol threshold and you're dangerous enough to throw to the wolves, but just under and you're fine, even though people's tolerance varies greatly and someone slightly under might in practice be driving much worse than someone slightly over),<p>- mandatory bus/cycle lanes (so entering them even when you can see they are completely clear for a long distance is illegal, even if it's just to pass a vehicle in front waiting to turn the other way, and traffic is required by law to queue up behind the waiting vehicle instead),<p>- red lights for turns that don't cut across any other traffic (so you have to wait even in the middle of the night, on a completely clear junction),<p>- and, yes, complete-stop-no-really-we-mean-it-lines, for similar reasons.<p>The problem with such laws is partly that they are designed more for ease of automatic enforcement than in the interests of justice, and partly because as a consequence of the repeated black-and-white approach, many drivers increasingly take the view that if something is not explicitly proscribed by law then they can do it, and even if it is proscribed they can still do it if they think they can get away with it.<p>Wouldn't it be better if we had traffic laws that were actually in sync with what most experienced drivers would consider reasonable behaviour, and then used actual police officers for enforcement, giving them actual powers to stop and challenge people who are actually driving dangerously or inconsiderately? But of course that's too expensive and requires difficult things like making a real case in court using real evidence that somene's behaviour was actually harmful, so cameras it is.",1265047913

There is nothing surprising about exercise per se.<p>Popper once challenged an audience to go out and 'observe'; I think the point of his joke was that without knowing what you're trying to observe and why then the instruction is absurd.<p>In order to claim that 'more exercise is good' you need to start by guessing why <i>some</i> exercise might be good, whilst being open to the possibility that it may not be, and then start testing the best guesses. Otherwise you literally won't be able to interpret your 'more exercise' data, even if it is relevant.",1265047862

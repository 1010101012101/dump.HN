It doesn't have to be crazy, but preferably has elements that will challenge you. The best projects will hands down will be the development of tools that are useful to you/open source.<p>2.) If you have any network at all: friends, family or previous clients, send out a quick email. Tell them what you're offering and ask if they need anything done. Make use of those closest to you/familiar with your work.<p>3.) Post your info on the monthly HN ""Seeking Freelancers"" post. This is a great way to churn out quality projects.<p>4.) Get on and contribute to communities like Forrst (if you don't have an invite, let me know and I'll set you up) and GitHub. There are a lot of people on these sites that tend to have overflow work that's perfect for a freelancer. Just be helpful with others and contribute ideas frequently and you'll come out on top.<p>If you have any other questions, feel free to shoot me an email: me@ryanglover.net<p>Best of luck!",1327888763

It doesn't magically universally boost your intelligence, it is more of a catalyst to learning, storage and recall. In fact, if you wanted to boost your IQ and general problem solving ability you are better served to train your short term memory e.g. via n-back training. So is access to anything facilitating such not fair?<p>I think most of the resistance to intelligence boosting based on fairness are just appeals to status quo. It's occurrence is inevitable and the benefits of a more educated and intelligent populace working to improve their lot via technology is worth the cost if they can bootstrap themselves into something better.<p>And I very much doubt that such a device will cause as much of a socioeconomic divide as access to literacy, computers, electricity, internet, clean water and <i>iodine</i> has on the world.

3527103,comment,3526767,3526767,44,0,LogicX,,,"This is an amazing article. I intended to write such a blog article myself.<p>One aspect I intended to cover (and will now do so here) is that of cost.  I get very frustrated by cash-strapped startups which from day one are expecting to be 'web-scale' and need to turn up machines at the drop of a hat.  Lets get real. I HOPE you have to worry about that... much, much later.<p>I'm quite pleased you started your article mentioning solutions like heroku. Unless you have some special-needs not met by a PaaS, this is where you should start. You should be writing code, not managing servers (this coming from an operations guy who has been managing servers for 12 years, and worked at a webhost). Once you scale far enough that its worth hiring someone to deal with the knowledge required to deal with the maintenance of managing your application stack, OS updates, security, etc -- THEN move on. Not a moment before.<p>Cloud servers are realistically not the price/performance/low-maintenance solution for MOST startups. You should get a VPS (Linode) or dedicated server (from a reputable company which can offer quick SLAs on replacing parts - like 2 hours at voxel.net). Dedicated servers are cheaper than you think. I pay voxel $180/mo for an 8GB quad core 1TB box on 100mbit/sec. It outperforms servers costing twice as much in EC2 - and thats not counting bandwidth or storage. Concerned about reliability? Buy TWO - In different datacenters. -- You're STILL saving money, and you have the exact same level of maintenance overhead as AWS (OS, Updates, full application stack); while reaping the performance benefits of bare-metal.<p>You do NOT want the headaches of colocation. You cannot pay your staff enough to stay local to the server 24/7 and the cost of extra parts on hand to make up the money over dedicated.<p>Your startup is not Google, so I won't get in to having your own datacenter.

DSL, or whatever your office has in probably not that reliable, and single-homed (your ISP goes down, so do you).<p>Cooling:
Offices are not designed to cool servers. The AC gets turned off at night and on weekends. Airflow is bad.<p>Power:
Once you start running more than a few servers you will need to add special wall/roof mounted AC. The combined power of the servers and AC will cost you thousands per month.<p>Need:
If you don't need more than a few servers, you don't need your own servers. It will cost less to rent a little space on someone else's server (VPS).<p>Hard:
As the article says, ""Hardware is hard."" You have all the downsides of Condo and Manor, with none of the upsides.

3527060,comment,3525927,3526686,10,0,nessus42,,,"As someone who has programmed professionally in Java, Scala, and Lisp (including Clojure), I might be qualified to assert that your sports analogy is off the mark. All of these programming languages can be effectively used to solve many of the same problems, though each language may excel at addressing certain kinds of problems better.<p>For me, programming in a dialect of Lisp is just more fun than programming in the other languages. Java is not fun at all, in comparison. And that's largely due to the fact that it can be difficult in Java to write reusable code. Consequently, you either have to repeat yourself a lot or tie yourself up in knots to figure out a way to not repeat yourself. Repeating oneself is tedious and boring.<p>On the other hand, static type checking can save you a lot of time debugging. But it can also slow you down. It's probably a net win overall for most problems, but for some problems, it is too restrictive. I find Scala to be a happy medium for most problems, but I often switch to Python for small programs, where the freedom from static typing can make development much easier and faster.<p>I think the problem with Lisp is that most people just don't ""get it"". I'm not sure why they don't, but perhaps it's a fact that I just have to accept. On the other hand, I firmly believe that the state of software engineering would be greatly improved if most programmers <i>did</i> get Lisp. I can't say the same thing about Java, however. In Java there isn't really much to get that you wouldn't get by learning any other OO programming language.",1327887252

I thought this was because understanding itself is simpler (so there's less to remember), and one can reconstruct the facts from this understanding (also, verify them).<p>This is treating understanding as a theory, in terms of which the facts can be stated more briefly than without.  An abstraction, if you like, that factors out commonalities/redundancies. If A always implies B, then you can just need to rememeber ""A"".<p>But later, I've realized that in fact, I do remember a great deal of detail that isn't derived from understanding. Perhaps understanding actually requires a lot of domain knowledge - facts - that the understanding is about. You can't ""understand"" in a vacuum. So, now I think that's it's just that somehow, causal connections and explanatory relationships stick in my memory more easily - they are certainly more <i>interesting</i> to me (because meaningful), so that helps with concentration and therefore memory.<p>I actually once tested my opinion that I couldn't memorize, for a university exam, and found - to my amazement - that I could.

Like ADHD, depression is sometimes confused for being a product of the environment, when in both cases the environment is really just an exacerbating factor (clinical depression, unlike PTSD, cannot be caused by environment alone).<p>The problem with studying ADHD like this is that we generally agree that ADHD is over-diagnosed and over-prescribed, but then for evidence that ADHD  exists as a medical condition, we look to the existing pool of people who are diagnosed or even taking medication to confirm that there is a difference between those who are diagnosed and those who aren't. 'm not saying that this means ADHD is a hoax - I agree with you that it's more than just the environment. It's just very difficult to construct definitions for mental conditions in particular, because there's usually no way to do a double-blind randomized experiment.<p>The problem is that ADHD and depression are both heterogeneous conditions - they're likely not single conditions themselves, but a bunch of somewhat related conditions that we're currently unable to distinguish between. The various hypotheses for what causes ADHD (and depression) may not be mutually exclusive.<p>That makes studies that much harder to conduct, because you have a mixed population, which makes identifying characteristic traits harder (and sometimes impossible, depending on the mixture). It also means that anecdotal evidence is that much more worthless, because what is true about one member in the population could be completely false for another.<p>And, in some cases, having a mixed distribution can give you the exact <i>opposite</i> results; see Simpson's Paradox: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox</a>",1327885541

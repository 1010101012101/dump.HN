First it's SOPA, and if it passes then what?<p>The thing here is that nuclear is actually a poor metaphor. Because it would imply that the menace of Google, Amazon etc. doing something similar to what Tumblr did would be enough. It's not. Politicians don't understand the web, that's why they want SOPA. They surely did not understand nuclear weapons before a few of them had tragically been used.<p>That said, I also think that it would be preferable that big internet companies do not get to do what is described in the story. But not for the same reason as you seem to think. Here is my sweet dream: What I would like is for <i>people</i> to go on strike and to get down in the streets until SOPA is dead. Because that way politicians and all those who/which are backing SOPA knows what the web is capable of, without the web needing big private companies to back people up. Because some companies may be on the web's side for now, but everybody should keep in mind that these are companies, which mainly want/need to make profit. For this fight and for now the interests are the same so it's okay to use them as objective allies. It's never okay to really depend on them.",1325199453

3405762,comment,3404603,3404603,0,0,lowglow,,,"Question:<p>Imagine that you have a non-session-persisting load balancer in front of\na cluster of web servers (n >= 3). Since this load balancer doesn't\ndirect requests in any persistent fashion, a user making subsequent\nrequests may be directed to any of the servers available in the cluster\nin a non-deterministic manner. In your application, you need to handle\nimage uploads from users, and as soon as the upload is finished, you\nneed to show the user their uploaded image. This creates a problem for\nyou because after an upload, the load balancer may direct the user to a\nweb server which does not have the users recently uploaded image\nresulting in a 404 Not Found for the image request and a poor user\nexperience.<p>In the current system, an rsync process runs every 5 minutes and copies\nuploaded images around to each server so that every server has every\nfile, eventually. This isn't a very optimal solution because users may\nnot see their uploaded images for up to 5 minutes depending on which\nserver they are connecting to for any given request and it forces every\nserver to have a copy of every image uploaded, which may not be the most\nscalable solution.<p>Assuming you could not modify the load balancer, how would you redesign\nor fix this system so that files are uploaded in a way that it doesn't\nmatter which server in a cluster a user connects to in order to be able\nto satisfy a request for the file? There are many ways to solve this\nproblem. Please describe one or more ways and discuss the pros and cons\nof your solution(s). If your solution is very simple (not a bad thing),\nconsider offering a couple alternate solutions so we have a strong\nunderstanding of how you evaluate and approach problems.<p>-<p>My Response:<p>Basically that this was poor architecture and didn't make sense.

Hollywood and Big Media are very happy to work with established, institutional partners. Indeed, the types of partnerships that'd be formed, backed up by federal force, would serve to drive off potential competitors.<p>Would it really damage advertising revenues that much? If the fear is that Google would be hit by large lawsuits from some twelve year old posting a music video on YouTube, or that Facebook would be liable for a link to it, I expect that media conglomerates would be happy to give de facto immunity, so long as Google or whoever is willing to put Viacom's commissars in charge of which content is allowed and which isn't.<p>Obviously it's good that Google is on the side of angels on this, but if it's actually in their best interest is a relevant angle for analysis.

There have been consistent rumors that Amazon will step in with a few more tablet variants and a phone in the coming year. Facebook - Google's direct rival - was rumoured to be trying out an ""Android"" phone of their own.<p>All this is possible only because Android is open source.<p>It is fine to wish that Android is less loosely coupled from Google. Personally I think this is the only pragmatic choice. Android is not pure software, it is tightly integrated with hardware. Linux's achilles' heel for a long old time was device drivers. Android has mostly sidestepped this issue due to Google ""owning"" the project and working with the hardware vendors.<p>It would be nice to allow community input (commits, patches etc) into Android, but that I can understand why they don't right now. The thing is, anyone can create a more open fork that does this - and it wouldn't matter due to lack of hardware support.<p>The next best thing is to work downstream of the hardware, which is what Cyanogenmod and other teams have done. And they have been mighty successful at it too. When you see  community teams boot Android on iPhones, Playbooks, Kindle Fires and so on, you are witnessing the benefit of having a free open source mobile OS.<p>Android may be the Linux variant that has succeeded in the mobile world, but that doesn't mean Android variants can't exist.<p>Mozilla is still working on Boot to Gecko, which borrows from Android for some of the hardware interface:  \n<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G</a><p>Needless to say, only possible because it is open source.",1325198358

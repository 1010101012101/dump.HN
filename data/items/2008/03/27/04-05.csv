147571,comment,145035,145237,0,0,acrylicist,,,"I've been through the Google interview process [I'm not going to blog about it with any sour grapes, I'll try again for a different position later.], and I realized afterwards that it was a lot like map-reduce. You're being thrown through a bunch of interviews by different people (the map phase) who then forward their reports to their hiring committee (the reduce phase). Every interviewer is seeking to do a similar kind of analysis on  you: are you worthy of hiring?  Then they gather it all together and grind the sausage.  They probably interview thousands of people to harvest enough talent to fuel their progress, unlike other organizations that only hire to fill  known needs.<p>They don't tell you why they approve/reject, but I imagine that they probably have a similar process on the other side  if you are hired with regards to the package you're offered. Very likely, they'll seek to optimize the right amount to give you.<p>And yes, I do think they're probably missing out some great talent, because not everyone can scribble it out on a white board on-the-spot.  But you have to be able to communicate effectively to get anywhere, even in Google.",1206593949

147569,comment,147124,147124,0,0,giardini,,,"The article is worthless: not a single sentence of the first 5 paragraphs of the blog post makes sense when examined critically. The author does not understand relational databases nor how flexible they are. In fact I'm fairly certain he understands neither OOP, nor RDBMS, nor the Semantic Web (of which I am no proponent) well if at all.<p>Every now and then a developer community bubbles over with complaints about RDBMS and gets some attention. Most support is from people who, like the author, understand OOP to a certain degree but don't understand RDBMS.<p>And time after time predictions of the death of the relational database model prove wrong: RDBMS usage only increases. The relational database model supplanted the network database model (which corresponds to the ""graph databases"" the author speaks of) for good reasons.<p>Nothing to see here: keep moving folks.",1206593906

Why compare the optimality of such a schema to a rigid schema instead of comparing it to the optimality of an alternative ""graph-based"" data store?<p>Granted, an extensible schema will be slow to query/etc. What makes you say that you can achieve better efficiency using a non-RDBMS approach? (Not that you can't, but I didn't see your argument to that effect. I'd say that without such an argument, the optimality/speed point is unsignificant.)",1206591916

This has only been a couple dollars over many years of eBay usage.\n- Akismet: This is the anti-comment-spam service from Automattic. Based on my level of usage, I don’t have to pay for it, but I do anyway. I’ll likely stop paying for it now that I have switched to Disqus. I believe it was $5/month.\n- Dreamhost: They host my blog, in addition to a number of sites and email accounts I manage in a consulting gig for a little income on the side. It costs about $10/month.\n- NetFlix: I consider this a web service because the majority of my NetFlix consumption comes through their new online streaming offerings. Cost is $13.99/month.\n- Skype: I don’t have a Skype Pro account, but I do pay for SkypeOut minutes. It’s a heck of a lot cheaper than getting a landline. I spend about $3/month in SkypeOut calls.<p>What about you?",1206591729

147545,comment,147124,147385,0,0,wanorris,,,"Good points. I've run into this problem a lot, and generally handle it in one of 2 ways:<p>1. Make it easy for semi-technical project managers who are not coders to extend the schema. This is the 95% solution for us, and the core of our system.<p>2. use n-to-n lookup tables or lookup fields that use a second field to determine what you reference. We don't do this a lot, but we do it in a few places where there can be a more or less unbounded set of things that can be referenced. These indeed have problems, so we try to avoid them, especially in high-volume situations.<p>Then again, note that this solution (a) requires using our framework to be effective (b) has RDMS purists seeing red. So maybe you're right.<p>Edit: section redacted.",1206591583

I knew Git was basically started with that Bitkeeper war, but since I don't really follow linux politics much as I don't use it all that often, I didn't realize that hg was started then as well.

147539,comment,147345,147345,0,0,benreesman,,,"My biggest complaint about Rails is that it doesn't seem to solve any of the hard problems encountered by serious web developers. Routing is easy, selecting and applying templates is easy, organizing related action handlers into the same file or logical grouping is easy. There's nothing impressive about this, and DHH's arrogance only further frustrates me with Rails' shortcomings.<p>Flow control on the other hand is hard. Complex web applications are hard because HTTP is basically stateless. If I'm filling out a form and I want to do some multi-step modal flow for selecting an image from a number of galleries and return to the form I was working on then I need continuations or at least closures. Rails doesn't give me anything here, and the Rails answer (AJAX for anything more complicated than 'fetch a row and stuff it in a template based on a sequential integer ID') is still quite unsatisfying. AJAX is wonderful but your application should work whether or not it is available.<p>Seaside and to a lesser extent Arc and Rhino-In-Spring offer you a lot more, but Seaside and Arc don't seem to have much of a story when it comes to clustering, and Rhino-In-Spring (while beautifully executed) suffers from the same 'over-arching warm embrace' framework syndrome described in the article.<p>If someone wrote a web framework as a set of high-cohesion, low-coupling components that gave me high level flow control abstractions but got out of the way when all I wanted to do was stuff a row into a template, and furthermore could credibly scale out to a large horizontal cluster they would probably take over the world.<p>I've started prototyping such a tool, also using Rhino. It adds package management and a few other things to JavaScript 1.7 to make it suitable as a general-purpose programming language (i.e. it makes sense to use it for command line scripts as well as web applications). It also offers, a la carte, a mod_perl like facility that simply invokes your module with the request and response objects and gets out of your way. On top of this there's another layer that takes care of routing, template application, and flow control. This last component is still in the early stages but is coming along nicely. It can serialize continuations and closures out of process and consume them another machine, using techniques borrowed from Rhino-In-Spring, so it can be clustered.<p>If this is interesting to anyone please let me know, I would love some feedback and help with it. I plan on open-sourcing it once it reaches a level of stability that makes it suitable for production use.",1206590761

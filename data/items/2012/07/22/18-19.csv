The problem is that if you overdo it, the goalkeeper will compensate, and a Paneka is a lot easier to save than a well-driven shot to the corner. You might notice that fairly often, even if the goalkeeper chooses the right way to dive, he sometimes doesn't make the save.",1342983595

4278155,comment,4277440,4277879,1,0,Someone,,,"I (dis)agree with you. One thing that a math degree will learn you very, very well is the spotting of gaps in logic. That is very applicable in e.g. software engineering/programming. For example, it will make you spot missing cases in long if/else if/else chains, both in code and in requirements. In the latter case, the risk is that you will get distracted by minor holes that do not really matter at the scope, and that other people may see as ""not worth discussing now, as it distracts from the main course."".<p>Also, reading <a href=""http://www.snhu.edu/mathematics-BA-online.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snhu.edu/mathematics-BA-online.asp</a>, my main thought was ""do they call THAT a math degree?"" At the very least, I would put a sticker ""applied"" on that. That is a judgment, but not one that judges one item as better than the other. For your ambition in machine learning, it will probably be tons more useful than what I (and from his reply, I guess philh) think about when hearing the term.<p>For an impression of the difference: With a MS in (abstract) mathematics, you will be able to prove properties of some algorithm or formula from some preconditions, and you may be able to generalize them to some highly abstract terminology (for an example, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)</a>, which grew about mathematicians thinking deeply about what the concept 'area' means) but you need not get any experience in recognizing those preconditions.

4278154,comment,4277426,4278109,1,0,anovikov,,,"Well, the retirement savings are somehow (directly or indirectly) invested into a stock market, so they are safe from inflation, or even complete currency crash. When inflation is high, you even benefit, because people's consuming activity increases as there is little they could do to save money which is being burnt with inflation, so they spend, improving the bottom line of the companies they buy stuff from - and stocks of which you have. Or they buy stock directly, increasing real price of stock directly by increasing demand.<p>That is valid even in the case of extreme inflation - like 1923 Germany. People suffered, but stocks didn't.<p>Only exception from that rule was the 70s oil shock, but that wasn't a real crisis (economy itself was doing just fine, only the oil became expensive for purely external political reasons).",1342983304

4278145,comment,4277426,4277426,2,0,uptown,,,"One huge problem with the evolution of the retirement system has to do with how retirement savings are vulnerable to outside influences.  The stock market is no longer just investors deciding that a company sells a good product, and stands to increase in value so is a safe investment.  The market has evolved into a massive casino of automated algorithmic trading ... with transactional activity coming from automated systems far outpacing the buy-and-hold activity that most individual investors are participating in.<p>Separately, you've got municipal or a private college's retirement plan that's broken off into pieces and handed off to hedge fund managers with the hope that they'll see a good-return on the retirement savings of their employees.  Sometimes this works out ... and sometimes the hedge fund goes under, taking with it whatever investments the retirement plans had entrusted it to invest.<p>Then you've got too-big-to-fail financial firms that have ensured their own existence (because if they fail, they'll take the entire economy with them), pre-written their individual executive exist-strategies (golden parachutes / LEH, etc.), but have branches of their firms tasked with growing the money under their control.  Maybe they'll succeed.  Or maybe they'll make some bad bets and lose $5.8 billion dollars for the firm (JPM) ... and the multitude of mutual funds, hedge funds, and individuals whose financial security is in-some-way connected to their financial well-being.  But hey ... they took a chance, and it just didn't work out this time.<p>Maybe on some other trading floor somebody makes a fat-fingered trade and blows $1.24 billion (Gold, 4/30/2012) ... subsequently throwing the market into disarray for a period of time while everyone tries to figure out if the economy is melting, or if it was just a mistake by somebody.<p>Meanwhile ... whether you're investing with the help of some ""guy"", or buying index funds, or going the individual stock route ... pretty much every choice you have is subject to the fuck-ups of people you don't even know exist.  They control whether you'll be able to afford to eat when you've stopped working.  Whether you'll be able to afford rent when you're no longer able to work.  And if you opt-out and just choose to sit on cash, or invest in CDs (whose rates are currently comically-low) you won't approach anything near staying on-par with cost-of-living projections given inflationary trends.<p>But hey ... we can't subject trading to regulation 'cause it'll stifle innovation!  We can't institute a per-trade transaction fee 'cause it'll decrease volumes and penalize those providing liquidity to the market.  In-fact, the market appears to be going the opposite direction ... towards even less regulation.  For everyone that supported the concept of Kickstarter for startup-equity, just wait till the elderly start gambling their retirement nest eggs into what's billed as the next Facebook.  It's a nice thought that startups can get access to an untapped market of small-time investors, but it's got the potential to amplify the already-bleak retirement outlook for unsophisticated investors.",1342983183

What conclusions can we draw from that? Three, actually. That PD causes sleep dysfunction, that PD is caused by sleep irregularities, or that both are caused by some unknown cause X. Based on correlative data, all three are equally likely. You, however, immediately jump to the sleep causes PD conclusion -- critically, without mentioning a mechanism for how that could work.<p>If you investigated PD a bit further, you'd realize that there's dozens of confirmed comorbidities (e.g., depression, cognitive issues, hyposmia, etc.). That doesn't tell us anything about anything.<p><pre><code>  > Amphetamines are drugs associated with pushing your \n  > brain to operate without sleep, and they're also \n  > associated with causing Parkinson's Disease\n</code></pre>\nWell, you know what else amphetamines are associated with? Interference with the dopaminergic system at a massive scale. What's the key neuronal pathology in PD? Right, SN-focused DA cell degeneration. So it's exceedingly more likely that DA function plays the role of causal link here than lack of sleep. Again, common cause.<p>Regarding genetics and Fox: We <i>know</i> that PD has a genetic component; there's promising mouse models and solid epidemiological data. Fox is one data point. His lack of family history doesn't suggest anything at all.<p>In summary, your whole argument rests on a flawed logical strategy. You're connecting three semi-confirmed factoids (increased PD risk among amphetamine users, amphetamines lessen the need for sleep and are taken by traditionally sleep-deprived groups) by positing a direct causal connection; namely, amphetamines -> no sleep -> PD. All this while ignoring much more sensible connections (e.g., via dopaminergic systems).<p>Sure, one could test this. But that's faint praise -- it's still far away from what cutting-edge PD research does right now and for good reason.

So what now? They're doomed to have tough lives and die young? I think that if we can make healthy foods more attractive, tasty, and affordable, then we should do that.<p>My cousin is an Optometrist. I currently wear contacts but I do not sleep in them. I saw a commercial for contacts you could sleep in and thought that would be a nice feature to have. Turns out that's not the case. It is unhealthy to sleep in contacts, regardless the type. Those contacts were developed because some people will sleep in their contacts even when they know it is bad for their eyes. So Optometrists won't prescribe sleep-in contacts to people who wear their contacts according to the directions (it would be less healthy for the eye than what they currently do), they prescribe them to people routinely sleep in contacts which are explicitly not made for sleeping in. The sleep-in brand mitigates the damage.<p>In other words, if you can design around behavior it is often helpful to do so. It is difficult to get people to change, especially when it requires giving up a near-term convenience or pleasure for a long-term gain. Nagging doesn't work.

That's a huge step forward, and since the need here is to protect the trademark ability of the brand, outrageous demands really aren't' called for.  Offering to pay for the cost of changing it if they are willing to do it earlier, is also a generous remedy that protects the brand.   The violator doesn't lose money, and the act of paying for the remedy is an act of protection.<p>I wonder if there isn't a third remedy in cases like this, where it isn't flagrant violations: That being licensing the brand.<p>Certainly trademarks are licensed all the time- coca-cola licensed clothing is a good example.  So, someone using your trademark under license doesn't undermine the ability to protect the mark.<p>Thus they could have offered to license the mark (as a third possibility) for a reasonable fee.  The fee would have to be industry standard (e.g.: ""You can use it for $1"" would undermine their ability to protect the brand) but I imagine for mildly infringing or only partially infringing situations like this the remedy is probably not too high.<p>Not that the publisher of this book would likely want to take them up on it, but maybe given the books content in some cases that might be preferable-- where the infringement on the brand has positive economic value for the book, and everyone makes out ok.<p>The trademark is protected, and the publisher makes a bit more money by being able to use this design than they would if they had to do something completely different.<p>Further, this activity- of issuing licenses- shows diligence of protecting the mark which enhances its trademark ability.  You might not know all the violators of your trademark, but it is the failure to defend the mark that can cause you to lose it.  A license is obviously not a failure to defend the mark, and so it helps bolster the mark.

The post I replied to said that ""language neutral bytecode project neve worked"" and brought up Parrot as an example. He was not specific to them not working for Javascript.<p>Now, besides off context, your comment is wrong in four ways:<p>1) we are not discussing about a bytecode to implement Javascript, but a bytecode to use in browsers for implementing all sorts of languages.<p>2) There are other lnguages that have been implemented in CLR/JVM that are faster than Javascript.<p>3) V8 has been optimized by a special team, for millions of dollars, with speed as the #1 target. When that amount of money and effort, a JS running on JVM/CLR can be fast too.<p>4) A bytecode does not preclude a JIT. In fact it would be trivial to have V8 run a bytecode instead of raw js, just as Python runs pyc.",1342980431

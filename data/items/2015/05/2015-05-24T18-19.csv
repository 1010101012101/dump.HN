Most RNGs are black boxes or are so non-transparent that they might as well be black boxes.<p>You might have an idea how your *nix /dev/random works, but can you actually guarantee your OS is not compromised?

9597151,comment,9596596,9597089,0,0,birken,,,"Liquidation preferences have value, and a lot of value, I&#x27;m saying that they just don&#x27;t make VCs immune from bad consequences.  I&#x27;m sure the reason they are so common is that a VC wants it, and it seems fair to the founder and is easy to toss in.<p>Founders certainly don&#x27;t accept anything the VCs dictate, and terms like this are on the table during negotiations.  This is especially why as an founder you want competition from multiple VCs so you a little bit of leverage.  But at the end of the day the VCs are going to want some sort of preferences over the common stock, and this is a fairly easy one to toss in.<p>As to why the preference might not be so great for a VC, let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical scenario.  I make a 20k personal angel investment in a company with a 1x liquidation preference.  A year later the company is tanking and sells for less than the valuation, but enough that I get all my money back.  Great.  I lost the opportunity cost of that 20k for one year, but nothing else.<p>But imagine the same scenario with a VC, but let&#x27;s say it was 20 million of their 100 million dollar fund.  A year after they make the investment, they get the money back.  But they now <i>must</i> return that to the LPs.  The fact they got the money back quickly makes no difference to them, because they can&#x27;t re-invest it.  And now they now have only 80% of their fund left to try and generate a big return.  Yes, getting the money back is better than not getting it back, but is wasted ammo they cannot re-use in their quest to generate a big return.<p>And also lost in this is that many times when a company is tanking they will either go completely bankrupt or not return all the money that investors put in (see: Fab).",1432493807

Zero and negative interest rates are causing enormous sums of capital to chase yield through non-traditional sources.  Sand Hill Road VC&#x27;s have a good pitch and connections, so they wind up with a significant portion of that capital.  That capital has to go somewhere, so the VC&#x27;s basically use the Stanford admissions process as a proxy for screening, and they give anyone that has been admitted and can get an app written huge amounts of this money.  VC&#x27;s haven&#x27;t suddenly gone crazy; they simply find themselves drowning in money that they have to deploy.<p>Some of these companies will undoubtedly be successful, as the ability to spread virally and scale the IT infrastructure to meet demand these days is absolutely unprecedented.

He&#x27;s lost the most basic information organization functions: &quot;share&quot;, &quot;receive&quot;, &quot;do at this time&quot;, &quot;do repeatedly&quot;, etc.<p>Instead he has to rely on others for all those functions.

I don&#x27;t know why you would expect random journals to be unaffected (where do you get cryobiologist reviewers who are unaffected or fearless?).<p>> I&#x27;m more inclined to believe the information on the article page than a general journal policy.<p>The journal policy which explains what the dates mean?<p>> Weirdly enough, all the articles in the most recently published edition of Rejuvenation Research (<a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/toc/rej/18/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.liebertpub.com/toc/rej/18/2</a>) had at least some gap between receipt and acceptance.<p>So are you even objecting to anything besides a software bug?<p>> The authors only use two methodologies for preservation, which they explain in the methods section:<p>I don&#x27;t understand your objection here. OK, so one protocol is still upcoming. I don&#x27;t think this is that unusual since I see plenty of references to publications in press in papers I read - econ papers spend years as preprints, I regularly comment on drafts, fast moving areas often do this, work which has been turned into multiple publications does this all the time because different journals move at different rates etc. I don&#x27;t think this is a big problem but <i>even if it was</i>, they <i>also</i> tested out the standard well-understood procedure you cannot possibly have any objection to, so what&#x27;s with this &#x27;only&#x27; business? That&#x27;s the method one wants them to test - and they did. And it worked the same for preserving memories. Which is the point.<p>> Further, the slow-freezing result is a fairly cheap one to replicate; we&#x27;re likely to see many people try it and they&#x27;ll likely cite Alcor&#x27;s work.<p>That seems unlikely. No one wants to go near cryonics for the political reasons I mentioned and there&#x27;s no funding for it. I have been saying for at least 5 years now that I really hoped someone would run exactly this experiment with seeing if training survived, and it took that long for any study to be done - despite always being cheap to run. Sometimes being cheap to replicate doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>> This is counter to what the authors state - they explain that the SafeSpeed method is actually slower than &#x27;slow-freezing&#x27;. See page 11.<p>I don&#x27;t see any such claim. I think you are again confusing different stages of storage and revival.<p>> This paper just isn&#x27;t compelling enough to say that we&#x27;ve seen this occur definitively.<p>I find it compelling. None of your arguments goes to the root, and most are tangential: it&#x27;s not a prominent journal because of the very well known politics involved, the dates are due to quirks of the website or acceptance process, the new protocol is not well-described but seems to work as well as the older methods and the older methods suffice to prove the point, and some confusion about the details doesn&#x27;t obviate the core claim either. The worms were trained, were frozen, were revived, and remembered. Which of your criticisms defeats this? This isn&#x27;t some mushy social psychology paper with n=15 and the authors could have tried a thousand different analyses to pull out a p<0.05; the worms either remembered or they didn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s not many ways to slice the data.",1432492540

9596996,comment,9596688,9596770,0,0,arcticbull,,,"I think for most decent engineers, if you have a small group of good ones, no matter the time pressures they&#x27;ll deliver you something half decently architected -- most likely with understood compromises. Where things start to take a turn for the worse is when more people pile onto the codebase without the context to know what the trade-offs were or where the load-bearing paint is, get in, make changes and get out. Now nothing makes sense.<p>In order to safely make changes to any one part of a codebase, an engineer needs to understand how it all fits together and have all that context in their head to ensure changes don&#x27;t have unintended consequences.<p>There are design patterns that make this easier of course and less error prone, but there&#x27;s no enforcement at compile time, and with people coming and going it all goes out the window.<p>I think we can solve a lot of these problems with much, much stricter and smarter compilers. Eventually, I hope we&#x27;ll all be writing software for which the compiler will be able to tell you authoritatively you&#x27;ve written the thing you set out to write and there are no bugs. As software complexity grows, no one or two people will be able to keep a whole understanding of the system in their heads (already true a most of the time). It follows for me that the only way to confidently make changes to a system you don&#x27;t understand is to automate that understanding.<p>That&#x27;s why I love what Rust stands for. It&#x27;s a first step to be sure. However, it makes the assertion that the only way to allow people to reliably develop software they don&#x27;t understand is to have the compiler &#x27;understand&#x27; it for them (I use understand loosely of course).",1432490910

Watson technologies, however, are designed so they work inside of a particular domain or with a specific corpus. So, the work with MD Anderson (<a href=""http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/news-releases/2013/ibm-watson-to-power-moon-shots-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/news-releases/2013/ibm-wa...</a>) has a nearly 100% separate data set from Chef Watson with Bon Appétit. I say nearly 100% separate data set because there are some common data sets derived from publicly available sources (e.g. wikipedia) that may be used by both systems.<p>One of the other challenges is who the systems are designed for. Although anyone can use Chef Watson, it&#x27;s not designed with everyone in mind. We&#x27;ve realized that the people with the best experiences are a little bit adventurous when it comes to cooking - they&#x27;ll play around and improvise with flavors to create new recipes. This is a different demographic than would likely be using the health care system (doctors and care providers).",1432490800

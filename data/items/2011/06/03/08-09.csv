See for example the mobile OS market, which is effectively inaccessible for new players right now unless they have a billion-dollar bankroll.<p>Your example of cryptography is a bad one, because those ideas are usually developed in educational environments, funded by tax dollars. For those rare classes of software where the idea really is non-obvious and takes a large time to develop, government can provide the necessary funding to develop it, without the other 98% of software having to suffer under a restrictive patent system.<p>2) The current system is flawed conceptually, we don't need a software patent system, never did. It's a myth, and there's no cost/benefit analysis that ever proved it as anything else. We don't need a patent system for many other classes of invention also. In most industries it's a net negative, not much more than a tax on doing business.<p>3) Whether or not software is like making art has nothing to do with the legal situation. If the laws covering art are even worse than the laws covering technological invention then those laws need to change as well. That copyright has been misappropriated to the degree that it has is not something you solve by making less subject matter copyrightable, but by fixing the law.",1307089185

I spent a good few days speeding it up and making it use less memory and it now runs in under 10 seconds. Here's a few things I did that worked for me.<p>1. Install APC and use it to cache objects as well as PHP files. Cache wherever possible. I used APC lots, as well as caching some heavy processing to disk. Cache results of expensive functions that are called many times in 1 script in a global or static variable.<p>2. Unwrap lots of the lovely OO wrappers, such as the ORM (similar to ActiveRecord). This made the code messier but much faster. PHP takes a big hit every time it instantiates a new object.<p>3. Take advantage of PHP's copy-on-write memory allocation; understand how PHP does garbage collection; use references where possible; understand what PHP is doing behind the scenes.<p>4.

2615560,comment,2614132,2614756,1,0,yason,,,"There are roughly two kinds of people based on their working habits.<p>One kind is the steady craftsman kind who gets up at 6, works three hours, takes a coffee break, works more, and continues in this fashion until he has reached his limit for one day. The other one is the crazy artist kind who mulls over a task for days until he suddenly gets inspired and taps right into the zone and works for hours or days nonstop and gets amazing things done.<p>Both kinds generally get the same amount of work done on the final page, they just divide the effort differently.<p>I've always observed that hacking, for me, is just like that artist's work: <i>I gotta do my work when I'm in the flow</i>. All I can do is give myself enough rest afterwards when it's over.<p>I've observed that when I'm rested and theoretically focused I might not get nothing done. I can pretend to be working but I just don't get it, get anything, or get anything done. I might consider myself a lazy ass of a procrastinator but luckily I know that is only one half of the truth. Sometimes it happens that I just code for 12 hours or 24 hours straight while hunger and consciousness of time gradually slip away, and that means I get lots, lots, and lots doneeven when I'm technically tired as a sloth but still in the zone.<p>A day-to-day work of a programmer is, thus, to work out a routine that splits your work in two halves. The boring tasks that require not much creativity are best done while not in the zone (and still you'll waste hours and hours and hours on nothing). The creative process of making is best reserved for when you've got the flow and then it means business, baby, and working like hell as long as it lasts.<p>Phew!",1307089056

This is a late phase of the scheme in which the early adopters are now fully stocked up on bitcoin, and are now hyping it very successfully. Late adopters want in, but the early adopters are not selling, and the miners aren't generating much anymore. Thus, supply is severely limited and the rate skyrockets, up more than 200,000% at this point. There is no telling what heights it will reach, but it's not over yet. At some point, the early adopters will start dumping, thus completing the scheme and leaving the late adopters with absolutely nothing.<p>I don't believe bitcoin is an evil planned-out scheme like this, but human nature may trigger this bubble effect.",1307088653

What's more important to you- financial stability or taking a chance to build something of your own?<p>If you have to, then a) could work- but I'd worry that your idea might be taken by the time it takes to build it while juggling a full-time job.<p>b) is good, but it also costs a lot more time than you might think. I outsourced for one of my projects and ended up more of a pain in the ass than having it done myself. The problem is that I have to dig through all the coding to fix a bug or completely rewrite a section that's coded wrong (your developers might not understand the exact function or idea you're trying to achieve) and you have to deal with having to take time out to explain everything in detail as the project progresses and often times lots of delays when a developer is no-show for a week.<p>C) I'd go for this option if you really believe in and love your idea. The prototype should be able to give you a good idea of whether or not it'll work and minimize your risk. If it doesn't work out and you can't get funding, it's still a soft landing and you can continue your work. If it's a big hit, then you could potentially be pursuing a life goal.<p>d) You could also sign up a co-founder or someone who's interested to work on the project with you. This would allow you to not outsource (Saves some money), have better control on the project and both of you are aiming towards a similar goal.",1307088234

For performance reasons queries should always be prepared / parametrized. On Oracle this makes such a big difference that at a big customer of my employer a single query by a different app in its own schema (ran lots of times) was the bottleneck causing five-fold decreases in responsiveness in our app on our schema.<p>- There's no escaping at all, this is like an open door for hackers.

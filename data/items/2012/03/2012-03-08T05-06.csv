Let the market decide if that is a good decision or not.

  3. Click the service to reveal the Add Shortcut button

3678683,comment,3666414,3667078,1,0,joesixpack2,,,"> you're kidding me right? Obviously you filter your queries to the closest node.<p>Smart aleck doesn't suit you.<p>Obviously, you can use standard DOM methods (e.g. gEBTN, gEBCN) with the ""closest node"" as well.<p>And, assuming you mean an element node, you just bought yourself a world of hurt. jQuery and the like will use the Selectors API (e.g. QSA) when it suits them, and due to their disagreement with the specs, element nodes don't suit them. Some scripted query engines (e.g. YUI) ignore the disagreement, favoring wrong answers fast over right ones slower.<p>When the libraries use their own query code, performance and compatibility go right down the toilet.<p>In other words, use QSA with the document node, unless you want to relearn how queries work.<p>> Having css3 query support in legacy browsers is awesome.<p>Except that you don't have anything close to that (assuming you are using one of the ""popular"" libraries). And, even if you did, would you really want to send that crap to an iPhone?<p>Only way to do it efficiently is to load the library inside conditional comments and use QSA for everything else. That is assuming you can find a query engine that actually works as expected in IE 6/7.<p>>> massive speed losses from parsing
> Nobody is searching the entire dom for matching nodes.<p>Parsing selectors is parsing selectors, regardless of how they will be used. One element or the entire DOM; it doesn't make a bit of difference.<p>> The single biggest performance killer... far more important than tree traversal is event overhead. As long as you think long and hard before applying a new event handler (and use delegation whenever possible) you'll be fine even with those 'Frankenstein' queries hehe :P<p>Again, event delegation is unrelated to queries. It's silly to assume you can use wasteful queries with impunity as long as you don't attach too many listeners.<p>Oh, but wait, jQuery tangles up queries and event delegation with its ""Live"" feature. So you are screwed either way. :(<p>And those ""Frankenstein queries"" are the exact opposite of self-documenting code (something most jQuery proponents/marketers get backwards).",1331183779

This corrects a known flaw which led to the leakage of the password_sha and salt fields. The good news is that the leak is plugged. The bad news is that it existed for quite a while.<p>tl;dr<p>Your password wasn't leaked, but the hash was. Still not great.<p>It's fixed now.<p>Reset your npm account at http://admin.npmjs.org/reset<p>I'm very sorry.<p>Email me at i@izs.me if you have questions or would like to chew me out. You have every right to be upset.<p>Details<p>To do login, npm uses the /_users database in couchdb. By default, CouchDB prior to version 1.2.0 makes this database world-readable.<p>Your password wasn't leaked. However, the password_sha hash and the salt was. This means that someone with lots of CPU power at their disposal could eventually crack it. If your password is relatively short, then less CPU power would be needed. If your password is a single dictionary word, then even less.<p>What We Did About It<p>The npm registry has been upgraded to Couchdb 1.2.<p>In order to facilitate the use cases where npm needs to read a user's public info, the non-sensitive pieces of the user record are being copied to a /public_users database, and the rewrites have been changed to point to the right places.<p>This means that the npm client continues to work without changes, and that the problem is fixed at the source, rather than relying on adding additional layers. Any downstream replicants of the registry will continue to work with their (exposed) _users databases without any changes.<p>Why Wasn't This Disclosed Sooner<p>It seemed wise to fix the exposure before telling a few thousand people about it. Jason Smith and I deployed the fixes on Monday 2012-03-05. We waited a few days to make sure that it didn't cause any additional problems, and to test things out. So far, it looks solid.<p>I'm very thankful to the handful of people who reported this to me discretely rather than create more drama than necessary.<p>What You Should Do<p>Here are the options:<p>Do nothing. Least secure, most convenient. Probably not enough.<p>If you used a very strong password (eg, some string at least 20 characters or so) for your npm account, then this might be ok. If it was something short, or something you use in multiple places, then please read on.<p>Reset your npm password at http://admin.npmjs.org/reset<p>It's a 3-step process. The thing emails you a link. You click the link. Then you remove the `_auth` line from your ~/.npmrc file, and run `npm adduser` to re-create your account. If you only used the password for npm, and not for anything else, then you're done.<p>If you have an old account containing capital letters or spaces in the username, then you'll need to create a lowercase url-safe version and add it to your packages. Ping me on IRC and I'll help out. (There are only a few of you.)<p>Reset/change the password of any service that has the same password.<p>Because your username and email address are part of the public npm registry data, someone could take the exposed password and try it on facebook, twitter, foursquare, HSBC, Bank of America, and so on. This would not be good.<p>Once again, I'm very sorry about the exposure, and the inconvenience it causes for you. You have a right to be upset. Feel free to email me with your gripes and complaints, as well as any additional questions you might have, or if you have any problems resetting your password.<p>--

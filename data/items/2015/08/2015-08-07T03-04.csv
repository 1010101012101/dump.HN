10020876,comment,10017613,10017613,0,0,adrusi,,,"The D programming language has compiler support for this. Unfortunately due to legacy concerns it&#x27;s opt-in, which makes it much less useful, and the designers have said that they regret not adding it to the language earlier when it could have been mandated.<p>It has the `pure&#x27; keyword, which can be used to annotate functions that don&#x27;t have any side-effects <i>other than mutating its arguments</i>. If you want to disallow mutating arguments, you can just const them up. In the article&#x27;s example, you could probably eliminate a lot digging through code by only looking at the functions without a `pure&#x27; annotation and where `profile.verified_email&#x27; is accessible in a non-const argument.<p>The D designers call the property that the `pure&#x27; annotation enforces &quot;weak purity&quot; and I think it&#x27;s a really useful notion for managing side effects in imperative languages. In C, for example, it just means that you can&#x27;t mutate global (or local static) variables, or mutate anything through them (no mutating the value pointed at by a global).<p>Shame it didn&#x27;t make it into Rust. I guess the rationale was that it made lambdas too complicated and didn&#x27;t reall come with much benefit (there aren&#x27;t many more ways to violate weak purity in Rust than in C, and Rust actually forbids mutable globals anyway).",1438919615

You have two options for who you decide to trust:<p>1) A VPN company, who you&#x27;ve had the opportunity to research, who&#x27;s primary business and reputation is based on handling your traffic.<p>2) Each and every WAP you connect to, in many cases with no real means to verify it&#x27;s actually e.g. the official WAP of the hotel you&#x27;re staying at, for something that likely costs the owners money rather than being seen as a profit center in and of itself.  Their primary business and reputation is staked on something completely different than their handling of your traffic (be it their coffee, their accommodations, whatever.)<p>If you trust #2, statistics eventually comes into play - you will trust someone who shouldn&#x27;t have been trusted.

10020855,comment,10016035,10020232,0,0,rdtsc,,,"Here are few lessons of Erlang (mostly stolen from Erlang Factory talks, books Learn You Some Erlang, Joe&#x27;s, etc).<p>* L1: Today we are stuck building distributed and highly concurrent systems. We don&#x27;t have a choice. Single CPU, single machine, where speed doubles every 18 month era is in the past. Because of the internet and lot of data most systems today are distributed. (How many startups do you know that ship a standalone desktop program these days?)<p>* L2 : Distributed and concurrent systems to be useful have to be fault tollerant. We don&#x27;t want a segfault or panic caused by one corner case, triggered by one client, to bring down the rest of the server and the rest of the million connected clients. That would be a horrible page/phone call to get at 4am<p>* L3 : For the systems to be tollerant they have to be built out of isolated components, such that when they fail that failure doesn&#x27;t spread through-out the whole system.<p>* L4 : Isolation can be achieved in a few ways:<p>- A runtime system that prevents sharing memory -- OS processes do this. Erlang&#x27;s VM does this as well, except you can have millions processes on a single machine.<p>- Proving memory won&#x27;t be shared. Rust&#x27;s compiler can do this. It can prove at compile time that you won&#x27;t have data races between your threads. Rust is the best and most interesting new thing in languages in the last decade probably.<p>- Running in a container, VM or a different machine. At the end of the day of course, if your service is running on a simple (non-mainfraim-y) single machine, it is not fault tollerant.<p>* L5 : These isolated concurrent units also send messages to each other to communicate (instead of say reading from a  shared memory with a mutex thrown in there some place). These units are often referred to as &quot;Actors&quot; and there is a whole class of frameworks, libraries that implement that besides Erlang (Akka, Orleans, etc.)<p>* L6 : Erlang in addition to these basic blocks also comes in with:<p>- Functional programming approach. Your data and variables are immutable. So it is easy to look at a piece of code and understand what is being changed. State updates are very explicit. And that is on purpose.<p>- A framework of patterns used to build/monitor/distribute these concurrency units. This is called OTP.<p>- Monitoring and debugging capabilities. You can connect to a running VM node, inspect, trace, debug even live code update without stopping the system.<p>- An decades long ecosystem and experience building these kind of systems.<p>* L7 : If you are afraid of non-curly braces syntax and do not like typing , instead of ; take a look at Elixir. It is a new language but runs on the Erlang VM.<p>Hopefully this helps!",1438919040

10020851,comment,10017613,10018800,0,0,adrusi,,,"Maybe the author, presumably well versed in type systems, assumed that the use of <i>effect typing</i> was implied. If you&#x27;re not familiar go check it out, but I&#x27;ll give a synopsis. If you&#x27;re familiar with `unsafe&#x27; in Rust, it&#x27;s a specific case of effect typing.<p>You can annotate a function with an effect (useful examples: unsafe, impure, throws exceptions) and then if another function calls that function, then it needs to also be annotated with that effect, or else the compiler emits and error. Usually there will also be an escape hatch where you can assert to the compiler that you know, in a way that it can&#x27;t statically prove, that a certain call to, say, an impure function, still doesn&#x27;t have side effects. Code that appears within these escape hatches needs to be heavily tested in order for effect typing to be useful.<p>For the above examples of effect types, the compiler will also consider certain non-function-call constructs to have an effect annotation. Dereferencing an arbitrary integer as a pointer, for example, would effectively have an &quot;unsafe&quot; annotation.<p>I believe Nim has a generalized implementation of effect typing.",1438918945

So you want to make a, ..., y as short as possible.<p>Similarly, dependency length minimization predicts that in English people will want to order expressions from short to long after a verb or preposition. There is a lot of evidence for this preference; it&#x27;s been documented since the 1930s.<p>If there were a programming language where the function name came after the arguments, like (a, b)f, then the best order would be long-to-short.<p>Similarly, the DLM prediction for verb-final languages like Japanese is that people will prefer long-to-short orders.

I wrote a few compilers in OCaml using only the core language and very simple modules (basically just signature + struct, no functors) and the end result was very easy to read and modify.  I think very few languages can make a similar claim: either the language doesn&#x27;t get you all the way and you need external help (e.g. C and its pre-processor) or overshoots into too much complexity (e.g. C++).<p>ML is not a language for all tasks (I am learning Rust for those times when OCaml is not appropriate), but I think that ML languages could be used beneficially in many more applications today.",1438917978

In this prospective study, Lv and colleagues have shown temporality of association, but we need to evaluate additional criteria to judge the strength of evidence.

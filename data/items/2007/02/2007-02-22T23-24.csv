572,comment,227,494,0,0,pg,,,"We never proposed there was no lower bound; the goal was more to discover where it was.  And we now have, I think.  Though in fact the main thing we discovered was how fuzzy it is.  <p>There really are people who can start a startup when they're 19. Sam Altman, the founder of Loopt, was 19.  But for most people the lower bound is about 22.  One reason is that most people need to experience what a job is like to be sufficiently motivated to avoid it.  Another is that few people are forceful enough at 19.",1172188299

568,comment,519,558,0,0,mrgordon,,,"You make a good point, although it is my experience that MIT does not echo Paul's feelings with regards to programming languages. There is obviously the group of hackers at CSAIL (Sussman et al.) that swear by LISP and the functional paradigms in general, but almost every class that involves a large amount of programming is in Java. Even 6.001 is being phased out for courses taught in Python.<p>As a current undergrad at MIT, I find myself sometimes struggling to determine whether I agree with Kevin or not. It does seem that my greatest selling point is my knowledge and experience with specific programming languages like Java and not any background I have in algorithms, discrete mathematics, etc. I feel that these other tools will prove more useful over the long term, but it's sometimes hard to continue to feel that way when the need for a summer job forces one to put away the common lisp book to read javadocs.",1172187062

565,comment,189,533,0,0,jadams,,,"I think the problem is that there are a lot of very smart people who are good at talking and generating ideas, but not so good at implementation.<p>If they're not regularly &#34;going dark&#34;, they may not have the focus to succeed at a startup.",1172186687
564,comment,189,513,0,0,jadams,,,"Interesting. Perhaps they should be performing traffic analysis to see who's busy, and who's not?<p>I love to debate (reddit has saved my wife a regular earful), but I can't imagine surfing when I'm really &#34;in the zone&#34;. I tend to do more directed documentation queries and explicitly avoid sites like reddit where I'm likely to become mired.<p>So yeah, for me posting frequency is inversely correlated with how busy I am. On the other hand, all of that reading, researching and debating generates a lot of new ideas.",1172186538
563,comment,538,538,0,0,dougw,,,"I find the most valuable part of this article the link at the bottom pertaining to questions cofounders should mull over before entering the venture together (For ease: http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/99/Important-Questions-Startup-Co-Founders-Should-Ask-Each-Other.aspx).  I have had a struggle finding cofounders that complement my style, skills, and ideas.  (Any coders out there that want to talk, hah?).  One thing I find missing from this list is that if you can't address these issues, or fore go these questions citing the fact that they will be addressed when the time comes (because coding is more fun) then you should rethink your partnership all together.  I find it much more important to ensure that anyone I am involved with is available for open and comfortable communication about all areas of the business.

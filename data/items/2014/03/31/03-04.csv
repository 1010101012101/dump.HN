These “stereotypical” kidnappings involved someone the child did not know or was an acquaintance. The child was held overnight, transported 50 miles or more, killed, ransomed or held with the intent to keep the child permanently.<p>115 children out of ~74 million in the US. I understand it&#x27;s a highly emotional and tragic experience when it happens, but statistically speaking, the odds of your child being kidnapped are roughly the same as them being struck by lightning.  Part of the problem is the amplification effect of modern media.  Kidnappings are sensational stories and we have a very human and empathetic reaction to them.  Public perception would indicate that the odds of an child abduction are way higher than they really are.  The biggest risk to your kids being abducted is one you probably don&#x27;t want to admit -- around 200,000 children/year are abducted by a family member.  Another 58,000 by people they know.  Restricting your child from playing outside probably won&#x27;t do much to help those far larger threats to their safety.

For instance, I don&#x27;t see why they don&#x27;t just trade on a step interval. Basically everyone who arrives within 1 second of each other should have their trades executed simultaneously. Thus you have step of 1 second - nobody can get ahead of you because the travelling time between any two exchanges for even the slowest person is much, much less than 1 second. Does this make the market too slow? Just make the step interval whatever the slowest latency is for any given round trip at any given moment.

The math is highly advanced, and it will tell you important things about your resulting code such as what kind of stability properties you should expect, and how &quot;robust&quot; the code is (deliberately ambiguous term, but in most cases it means: does your code work equally well no matter what parameters you throw at it?).<p>In the realm of physics simulations, these math questions turn out to be amazingly delicate and failing to answer them before running your code on a very large problem very often leads to unexpected (and wrong) results, if the code actually ever successfully finishes executing.<p>There is therefore a tremendous amount of literature where these questions are answered, all containing a meticulous amount of careful detail as well as deep insights coming from all the relevant branches: linear algebra, physics, functional analysis.<p>The problem however is that as we gain more understanding and knowledge the math hasn&#x27;t gotten any easier. Sometimes the arguments are so sophisticated that it really leads me to doubt whether the result can be trusted at all.<p>This leads into something which I know very little:<p>A better understanding of foundations really is called for here, and a foundation which lends itself better to computation than what is currently available. Computers need to start being able to verify proofs better. Proof assistants exist today, but their use is currently limited to computer scientists because they rely on deep results in that field relating type theory to mathematics - it represents a tremendous barrier to practicing mathematicians.<p>I hope in the future that &quot;reproducibility&quot; in my field means not only submitting your code so that other people can reproduce your performance claims, but submitting proof documents to be independently verified on someone else&#x27;s computer. Whenever I read the small bits about univalent foundations it sounds like they are adding magic sauce to make this possible, and so I follow it closely (but don&#x27;t understand it all yet).<p>The interesting path I spoke of earlier: I&#x27;m now learning type theory and functional programming just so that I can make sense of this branch of computer science that I originally didn&#x27;t know existed.",1396236555

This mixin approach only gets gnarly if there&#x27;s any feature envy. (Document your object properties clearly, folks. This is where javaScript&#x27;s flexibility often becomes a crutch - lots of issues happen if mixin code uses &quot;this.foo&quot; for different things.)<p>Anyhow, what&#x27;s interesting here is that Account carries the property that&#x27;s shared, but CurrentBalance carries &quot;behaviors&quot;, and is <i>not shared</i>, and your &quot;child classes&quot; like VisaDebitAccount embed both in different ways. It is a very different way of thinking about object relationships, and often works smoothly.<p>But if you&#x27;re using classes in JavaScript like you would Java, well, then, you&#x27;re not really using JavaScript, right?

7499411,comment,7494239,7499222,2,0,mjn,,,"<i>Where</i> are these mythical cities where you can walk everywhere, though? I&#x27;ve lived most of my life in the U.S. (29 years), and I still spend about 2 months a year there (I moved abroad in 2011). But few people anywhere I&#x27;ve lived, or where I currently visit, will walk places, especially solo after dark (especially women, it seems). And the people who do are extremely cautious, absurdly so from a Danish perspective: the idea that a young woman aged ~20 could bike home drunk at 4am on a Saturday night by herself seems reckless to Americans, but entirely normal to Danes, because Copenhagen is safe in a way that no American city is. In the U.S. in my experience, most people are very cautious late at night in urban areas. Perhaps they <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be, but it&#x27;s a very noticeable cultural difference.<p>I could be looking in the wrong places, I&#x27;ll admit. I spend most of my time in the U.S. in Houston and Atlanta, where I have friends and relatives, secondarily in L.A. and S.F. Maybe those are bad choices, despite being some of the most economically booming cities in the country? I could imagine much of Manhattan is safe these days, so that&#x27;s one possibility. Is there anywhere else? Houston, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco certainly don&#x27;t lend themselves to random walks at night; people tend to carefully delineate which areas they&#x27;ll walk in at night, if at all. Much of NYC is still sketchy; <i>parts</i> of Brooklyn are safe but you have to be knowledgeable about which ones. My brother lives in the Mission in S.F., and while it is <i>sort</i> of safe nowadays, past midnight walking safely really depends on what street you&#x27;re on, and you don&#x27;t exactly just take the shortest path on Google Maps to get somewhere else in S.F., especially not if it takes you through the Tenderloin.<p>I mean actually safe, fwiw, not just relatively safe: as in, you will <i>definitely not</i> be mugged, even walking solo at night. That&#x27;s to me what it means to live in a safe city. A large proportion of the people I know who walk in an American city have been mugged at least once (off the top of my head, one person in Brooklyn, one in Atlanta, one in San Francisco, three in Los Angeles, one in Houston, I lost track of how many in Chicago). Whereas if you&#x27;re mugged in Copenhagen, it&#x27;s so rare that you&#x27;ll make the newspapers— especially if you&#x27;re mugged by someone carrying a gun, which will produce front-page headlines and a multi-week police investigation trying to figure out how this person could&#x27;ve gotten a gun. Overall, I just feel much safer here, despite being born and raised in the U.S. and feeling more &quot;at home&quot; in the U.S.<p>If you mean that there exist small upper-class walkable neighborhoods in the U.S., sure: that&#x27;s also true of Istanbul. But are there walkable <i>cities</i>?",1396236219

Probably the fact that he was drunk played into his foolishness, but by his own account and the account of the police report, the cops had a drunk guy and his friend interfering with the first responders&#x27; work, the police asked them to step back, they were belligerent to the police about it and refused to step back, when the police tried to move him he resisted physically, so the cop put a lock on him, cuffed him, and arrested him.  When a drunk is interfering with first responders, disobeying lawful orders, and physically resisting efforts to move out of the scene what else are they going to do?  They ordered him to leave, he was belligerent, they pulled him away, he resisted, so they pinned him, cuffed him, and off to jail he went.  Maybe they were too forceful, but all we have are the memories of the angry drunk guy prone to fits of screaming by his own account - no medical records or corroboration, and the cops actually made sure there was surveillance of the incident preserved.<p>They treated him pretty harshly in the jail, but by his own account he was screaming and acting out.  It&#x27;s not a real shocker that the drunk screaming guy misbehaving in jail is going to suffer for it.<p>There are legitimate cases of serious police abuses.

It would let them interact with the site without that slight fear that their comments are going to waste, because they know the site would visibly prevent them from writing comments if they’ve been banned.

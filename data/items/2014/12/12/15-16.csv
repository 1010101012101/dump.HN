However. $SYSTEMD_LESS is quite possibly one of the most aggressively stupid ways to force a bad UX on someone.<p>I mean seriously. If you have $LESS defined then you obviously have an expectation that less will behave in a certain way. An expectation that has in all probability built up over years of tweaking your shell.<p>For some other application to ignore that preference and in fact force it&#x27;s own preference on you and only allow you to use your own preference for how less should work by reading <i>not</i> the docs for less but the docs for an unrelated application? That breaks so many rules it&#x27;s just sad.<p>Yes it&#x27;s easily fixable with a quick peek at the man page for systemd which might not be the first thing you check given you&#x27;ve been using less for years. Systemd&#x27;s manpage is the last thing I would check. First would be what is my $LESS set to? Second would be is less still less? At some point it would occur to me that maybe systemd is being aggresively stupid and check their manpage.<p>But given I have no particular preference I would be inclined to assume it couldn&#x27;t possibly be systemd&#x27;s fault.

There are three main disibility programs: SSI, SSDI as the dependant of a retired worker, and SSDI as a disabled worker.<p>Everyone is eligible for SSI but pays the least (maximum $733 / month federal, some states add a small amount). Someone on SSI whose parent has enough qualifying working quarters can switch to SSDI at 1/2 of the benefit the retiree would be eligible for at full retirement age. This currently tops out at around $1400 / month. Finally, if you yourself have worked enough qualifying quarters (6-20 depending on age) and become disabled you may be eligible for primary SSDI.

It forces me to bring blurry notions into sharp focus.<p>And lastly, I believe it makes me a better person.  Programming is a refined balancing act between abstracting and precision, between simplicity and complexity.  Doing that balancing act makes me more capable of handling other situations.  It trains your mind to understand complexity and reduce it, just as it trains it to see the problems with simplicity that make it more complex.<p>Oh, and it&#x27;s also a great way to pay the bills.

8740593,comment,8735892,8738339,0,0,ssmoot,,,"> It did inject a function, it&#x27;s right there, in plain text. Then it did type inference.<p>Yes, the inferencer/type-resolver runs after the parser (there&#x27;s a recent thread on the ML about a Parboiled parser you might find interesting BTW). My point was this is <i>parsed</i>. It&#x27;s an <i>AST</i> at that point, it just hasn&#x27;t resolved the types yet. It&#x27;s not a <i>source preprocessor</i>. To me that implies limitations, but also an expectation of consistency.<p>> ... what about &quot;1 + _ * 2&quot;? What is it lifting? The asterisk? No. It is lifting more than that.<p>Yes! Paste your code into the REPL and see what you get:<p><pre><code>  scala> 1 + _ * 2\n  <console>:8: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1) => 1.$plus(x$1.$times(2)))\n              1 + _ * 2\n</code></pre>\nThis is a real hairy example IMO since it&#x27;s conflating the mechanics with optional parenthesis and dot-less method calls, but we can break it down just the same. Since Int.+ takes a single argument, then it <i>must</i> parse as:<p><pre><code>  1.+(_ * 2)\n</code></pre>\nNOT<p><pre><code>  (1 + _) * 2\n</code></pre>\nThe first example is trying to lift $times from something. The second is trying to lift the instance-method <i>that&#x27;s already bound</i> to 1:Int to a Function0[Int].<p>They&#x27;re doing exactly the opposite thing right? It&#x27;s like assuming that the LHS and RHS of an assignment are interchangeable. They&#x27;re not. One is a label and one is a value.<p>> how much of the context does it grab along with it?<p>None. In this position, it&#x27;s the <i>beginning</i> of an expression. It doesn&#x27;t escape the scope it&#x27;s defined in. Just like in the 1.+(_ * 2) example, what comes before it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s the beginning of an expression.<p>> I still don&#x27;t see what type inference has to do with this.<p>I probably just complicated things bringing it up. ary.map(_ * 2) vs ary.map((_:Int) * 2). I feel like maybe it&#x27;s not understood that those do the same thing. The only difference is the type is inferred from the signature of map[T] (simplified minus CBF) on the first.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to debate that sometimes it&#x27;s frustrating that I can&#x27;t just:<p><pre><code>  documents foreach(couchdbActor ! Queue(json.merge(_)))\n</code></pre>\nIntuitively, it seems like it&#x27;s possible it could work. And it might if the underscore was accomplished through code-rewriting of some sort right? But it&#x27;s not. So what I&#x27;m doing is:<p><pre><code>  documents foreach(couchdbActor.tell(Queue(JsObject => JsObject))\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not satisfying the signature of foreach because tell() isn&#x27;t returning a Function[JsObject,Nothing], and I&#x27;m passing a Function[JsObject,JsObject] to Queue.apply (case class Queue(payload:JsObject)). Neither of those things makes sense. So what I do instead:<p><pre><code>  documents foreach((couchdbActor ! _) compose Queue compose json.merge)\n</code></pre>\nBreaking that down, I&#x27;ve got:<p><pre><code>  (couchdbActor ! _) // This just lifts the tell method, which gives me a Function[Any,Unit].\n\n  Queue.apply // Function[JsObject,Queue]: I can compose that with my lifted tell to get a Function[JsObject,Unit]\n\n  json.merge // Function[JsObject,JsObject]: Doesn&#x27;t change the signature: Function[JsObject,Unit]\n</code></pre>\nNow foreach() gets passed a Function[JsObject,Unit]. Which is exactly what it&#x27;s expecting.<p>When you break it down, you have to keep a &quot;stack&quot; in your head. Which can get hard sometimes (at least for me), but the underlying consistency about what&#x27;s actually happening makes it <i>simple</i> to do. It&#x27;s like a basic addition problem:<p><pre><code>  27 + 34 + 192 + 11\n</code></pre>\nI expect for most people that takes some deliberate thought, breaking it into smaller operations, carrying the result in your head as you go. But it&#x27;s still <i>simple</i>, because it&#x27;s <i>consistent</i>.<p>> In a dynamic language, you would stop at the lift, but it would otherwise work just the same.<p>I was going to attempt to write a Ruby analogue, but I can&#x27;t actually figure out a clean way to do that.<p>I dunno. I feel like you probably understand all this just fine. You just don&#x27;t like it. You&#x27;d prefer a sort of source-rewriting approach? So maybe Scala just isn&#x27;t the language for you. I feel like once you understand the mechanics of the underscore, it&#x27;s pretty straight-forward. Similar to beginners getting tripped up on for-comprehensions:<p><pre><code>  val o = Option(1)\n  val f = Future.successful(List(2,3,4))\n\n  for {\n    n <- o\n    l <- f\n    x <- l\n  } yield n + x\n</code></pre>\nThat trips up everybody at some point right? If you understand that it&#x27;s just map, flatten and filter, it&#x27;s clear why that doesn&#x27;t work though. How do you say: Option(Future(2)).flatten? What would that do? Can&#x27;t work. It may be initially frustrating for new users, but it&#x27;s consistent. If you study the mechanics, then it becomes second nature. <i>The mystery disappears</i>. That&#x27;s really all I was trying to do here. Hopefully someone finds it useful.<p>Side note: This is a big part of why I find for-comprehensions mostly useless. They do <i>nothing</i> you can&#x27;t already do, and they introduce what can look like magic. They&#x27;re pure sugar, except more often than not, they&#x27;re also longer to write. Plus they&#x27;re mostly useless outside of testing. How often do you want a Failure to just throw? Or a Play Action to return a None? More often than not, you&#x27;re gonna want to fold(), getOrElse(), match { case None => NotFound; case Some(foo) => ... Ok(finalResult) } etc. But I digress. :-)",1418398681

Open hardware like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards, as well as a ton of new IoT startups (like Spark and their Photon), and the bevy of open sensors (like Grove&#x27;s) are drastically lowering the barrier to entry for hardware tinkering and even garage-style production. Just check out Seeedstudio&#x27;s online shop to see how many different hackable hardware options we now have.<p>For $20 you can buy a WiFi &quot;kit&quot; that you can plug an array of $10-20 sensors onto. That opens up A LOT of doors for people to either create budget hardware products to sell, or for inexperienced home users to piece devices together. If wifi/gps/gsm chips and sensors can be plugged together like Legos, and if software can be &quot;beamed&quot; to it from their Phone, then you now have a perfect breeding ground for cheap, open hardware products available to the masses.<p>I look on to the next 5 years with nervous excitement; I myself have even begun planning a cheap cloud storage device using nothing but an RPi, external hardrives, and a few parts from Newegg that I can assemble in a couple minutes.

You could even just leave those versions off as users generally have the latest version of Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.

He had spent weeks working on concepts for the logo but nothing felt right, until one day he was getting into his car when he accidentally spilled a drink of coffee or something similar. When he looked at the ground where the beverage had splashed, he saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a bearded man clutching at his scalp, a representation of the design process: both frustrating and enlightening. He used the spilled drink as inspiration for what would become — and is still, today — the company logo.<p>Anything can be inspiration, depending on the lens you have on when you encounter it.<p>Research has shown that even subtle things we don&#x27;t consciously acknowledge have an impact on our ability to solve problems or generate ideas (i.e. to &quot;inspire&quot; us). The trouble is that, because we aren&#x27;t always consciously aware of what is inspiring us, we credit creative &quot;sparks&quot; to current conditions and stimulus, even if what really sparked that solution or idea in your mind was really inspired by a billboard you passed on the freeway four days ago or a book you read when you were younger.<p>As a result, we waste quite a bit of time &quot;seeking&quot; inspiration. We feel like understanding where others gets their inspiration will somehow magically help us to find it ourselves more often. But that&#x27;s not always the case.<p>More often than not, the best way to be inspired is to bury yourself in the problem or task you&#x27;re working on.<p>To quote smashLAB co-founder Eric Karjaluoto:<p><i>&quot;The problem with inspiration is that it’s random, which leads you to focus your hope on outside influences you can’t rely on...These stimuli aren’t under your control, available on tap, or always relevant to the work at hand. Thinking you can find ideas elsewhere leaves you flipping through magazines and browsing the web, hoping you’ll stumble on a magic cure.&quot;</i><p>Of course asking what inspires others can be enlightening and entertaining. I&#x27;m not going to bash any of that outright because that&#x27;s a battle already won (just look at the thousands of books that sell each year around how to &quot;find&quot; inspiration).<p>Perhaps I&#x27;ll leave you with another quote from Merlin Mann:<p><i>&quot;Joining a Facebook group about creative productivity is like buying a chair about jogging.&quot;</i><p>For more thoughts on the subject, consider:<p><a href=""http://everythingisaremix.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everythingisaremix.info</a><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@mikula/its-okay-to-be-dumb-d536915238cd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@mikula/its-okay-to-be-dumb-d536915238cd</a><p><a href=""http://jamesclear.com/schedule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamesclear.com/schedule</a>",1418397350

Those magnet links point to content which is then exchanged either in a truly distributed fashion (DHT) or through these third-party trackers.<p>So the centralization doesn&#x27;t provide &quot;core functionality&quot; to torrenting <i>per se</i> - it just provides a degree of quality. Nothing&#x27;s preventing you from sharing magnet links on other forums (heck, you could paste one in an HN comment). But someone needs to be able to trust that what you&#x27;re posting is, in fact, the content that you say it is and not a virus, honeypot, etc. <i>Any</i> forum that a group of people trust could serve this functionality (Reddit, HN, Yahoo Answers, etc.[1]) instead of TPB. The competitive advantage of TPB is not the content that it has, but the reputation that it&#x27;s built over the last decade.<p>There are Silk Road-based alternatives, which use the Silk Road model for guaranteeing reputation. I guess Tor isn&#x27;t technically &quot;decentralized&quot;, but it&#x27;d be a small step to modify the Silk Road approach to broadcasting the actual magnet links themselves.<p>If you want to decentralize the last remaining centralized piece of TPB, you&#x27;d have to solve the problem of decentralizing reputation. This is something that&#x27;s been worked on in a number of areas (e.g. Bitcoin) but remains unsolved. Perhaps the next TPB will use the Bitcoin blockchain, and this could somehow &quot;solve&quot; the issue, but there are a number of kinks that would have to be worked out.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table</a><p>[1] Notice that these are all centralized",1418397321

For example it should have had at least the first two distinct components listed below, something like:<p>1) git-fs (versioned filesystem, only supporting commit, clone and permissions)<p>2) git-merge (diff utility to handle merge conflicts)<p>3) git-local (two repositories wrapped in an abstraction to provide local and remote - the special sauce of git)<p>4) git-util (everything else like repair, reports, statistics, etc)<p>5) git (umbrella executable above previous layers)<p>I’m not super familiar with git console use so if it already is organized this way, great.  But since it is not presented this way in its documentation, I feel that a great opportunity has been missed.  We could have used git-fs the same way that people use Dropbox.  Instead we have something with a lot of warts (things like .gitignore files interspersed with other files that continue the same mistakes that cvs and svn made, and the inability to save empty directories).  I think git’s pattern of pull/commit/push is fantastic, but its shortcomings are so numerous that I’m going to stop knocking it right here before I get myself in trouble.<p>If gitfs ran on the Mac, I’d probably be using it right now to avoid frequent headaches where git interferes with the simplest pattern of pulling, merging by hand and pushing all files back if nobody else has committed in the meantime.  I think that’s the motivation behind a library like this, because so many version control systems get the filesystem metaphor wrong and create two much friction by touting their various levers.",1418396658

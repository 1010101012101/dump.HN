If the 25 year old was actually equally qualified, it would make sense to hire that person because they are young enough to move up the management track and into the succession track.<p>So if I'm looking at succession, I'm probably going young.

The first two offenses have to be deemed ""serious"" offenses - which, if memory serves, only includes a violent felony or child molesting.<p>If someone commits two violent crimes and then commits a third felony, they're probably not someone who was going to wise up. A guy who commits third degree murder once, gets out of jail seven years later, commits aggravated assault, gets out of jail five years later, and then commits a third felony just doesn't get it, and is obviously going to keep committing crimes.<p>There was a famous case people were outraged about where a guy got three-strikes life in jail for stealing a stereo system. What the newspapers didn't report enough was that he'd already mugged someone with a knife and stuck up a convenience store at gunpoint. I think there's a pretty reasonable case that that guy was going to keep doing stupid violent stuff until you locked him up forever...<p>(I did a little research into this - I was really against three strikes at first, until I actually learned more about it. It actually seems pretty sensible. The overcrowding problem at prisons is largely unrelated to three strikes, and has more to do with prison sentences on some offenses that you could probably just issue a fine and move on)",1291346722

He always seems to have complaints about the web, which are good for somebody like me (always looking for fun projects). After some discussion we started coming up with a pretty neat sounding idea.<p>The idea is to be able to highlight some text on a page, and create a permalink to the page that shows those highlights. For example, you're on Wikipedia and see a sweet quote, or really important word, and you want your buddy to read it. You could copy and paste it to him, over AIM or something, and then send him the URL, too. Or you could just send him the URL and say ""scroll down to the third paragraph."" Or, you could use this idea and highlight that quote or word somehow and create a permalink to that exact word. It would function exactly like HTML anchors do, but without requiring that page to have an anchor where you want to link to.<p>I don't know if anything likes this exists in a pure Javascript form or not. I know there are browser plugins that can kind of do this. I know some blogs append anchors to every paragraph for this. But, that doesn't really matter, I'm just trying to figure out how this would be possible without using those methods.<p>I was thinking in terms of Javascript, but I'm not sure if it's quite possible. I'm pretty sure you can't load up the page being linked to in an iframe and run javascript on it. I know you can't ask that page to load your JS.<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how this could be possible without a browser plugin?<p>Edit: I have also thought about a bookmarklet. This would allow you to generate a link to a certain area of a page, using whatever algorithms you had to find that area and create a link. But, I don't know how it would work in the opposite direction: going from link -> area of page.",1291346194

It's not A/B testing but I could see engineers iterating over variations - should the envelope follow the curves of the text or be a box or blob, etc.. All spacing, be it kerning or border-width can be iterated over, colours too - indeed thinking of this makes me want to write an Inkscape plugin to help in font choice.<p>You can level your objection again but I don't think one would call thinking what shape an outline could be ""design"" per se. Indeed if you're just presenting alternatives to a user and looking for the one with the best feedback I think you arguably have done away with a design stage.",1291346095

Of course, the cost is relative too.<p>A company I used to work for outsourced a large chunk of the work force to Poland.  Poland was chosen because they were technically sound, generally, spoke above-average intelligible English and, most importantly, valued the American dollar about 6 times more than we do.<p>This meant, generally, that they could hire 6 Polish workers for every American worker we laid off (if you ignore the fact that many of the American workers were longer in the tooth, and hence higher on the salary scale, which made it even more profitable a deal.)<p>The main worry about moving somewhere with an economy that isn't horribly weak is that as our American dollars infuse their economy, and more Polish outsourcing companies are stood up to attract more American dollars, we inflate their economy.  The cost of living goes up, the value of our dollar becomes less strong, and the benefits to having moved work there becomes less appealing.  This could well lead to a tipping point when American companies pull out, which I worry could 'burst the bubble' and leave Krakow Poland in worse shape than if we'd never been there.",1291345930

Totally undrinkable. Chocolate milkshakes were the only way to get something chocolaty, milky and drinkable.<p>Interestingly, lots of stuff about Indonesia struck me as surprisingly American (for a former Dutch colony in Asia), but I hadn&#x27;t considered that this could also be true for their chocolate milk.",1392976724

If the user interface would not fit in the fixed size screen of the card (it was 640x480px in the beginning and became resizable later on), it could be organized into multiple cards, each containing parts of the ui and with some navigation ui elements to browse between the cards.\nSecond, the card could serve as a database record. In that case the card would contain editable widgets to make a form (for example for addresses), then the card was declared to be a template (in HyperCard notation a &quot;background&quot;) and then as many cards were created from that background as database records were required. In that case field-widgets served as database columns, cards as records and backgrounds as tables.\nThird, the card (and its template-variant, the background) could contain code. Events (like a mousedown etc) were sent by the engine first to the respective widget on the card, then, when not handled, to the card itself, then to its template, then to the stack.\nThe HyperCard stack was the app, and a stack was a collection of cards and cards served as user interface canvas, and, very much depending on the application logic, additionally as code or data containers.",1392975389

7276100,comment,7275548,7275548,4,0,jarpineh,,,"I think what HyperCard got right was easy structured form based editing. You could insert fields into cards and use those as a template. When inputting a field you actually edited a property of an object directly. I can&#x27;t remember if fields allowed rich text editing nor programmatic access to it, so replacing Word was probably not possible. Creating complex forms and interfaces for data was certainly easier than with web browser. You could start your own solution by simply copying a suitable card. One knowledgeable user could create a powerful app tailored to company&#x27;s needs and others could build on that.<p>In the browser the presentation, runtime and persistence layers (otherwise known as DOM, JavaScript and the web/LocalStorage) are completely separate. So, you need loads of code to bootstrap your particular version of editable web that HyperCard gave you for free, without any save buttons, serialization protocols or web server and database installs. This seems so basic thing, yet it&#x27;s so hard to get there in the modern browser. Forms have in their own, peculiar data structure completely unusable for all but simple cases without a clever encoding system and JS data binding. Rich text editing is so unreliable across implementations that you need to get a library like CodeMirror to turn textarea into transformation pipeline simulating the process of input. Saddest part is that the priorities of developers are elsewhere, in building the browser into best consuming platform and a fastest tool to send little snippets of text to social network silos.<p>One of these days I might turn LigthTable into the past version of HyperCard, with the future build in. Since it comes with a browser, server and the JVM there should be more than enough code to replicate functionality of few megabytes of 68000 assembler ;)",1392974806

Does anyone know of such an MIT project from the early 2000s?<p>There were a few things that set this programming language apart from most of visual programming environments. First of all it was a proper programming language and not a toy project. The graph structure visualized recursion and re-use of variables very well. The code could be evaluated and edited at the same time by collapsing parts of the graph. You could collapse every iteration of recursion in the graph.<p>The most striking difference with normal programming languages was that all names were purely optional documentation.<p>Too bad I can&#x27;t remember the name of this project. I remember seeing a presentation video of this project which got me really excited. It was a language by computer scientists, for computer scientists and not something done for kids or designers to get their first baby steps in programming.<p>Out of the ones on the list, AppInventor/Blockly/Scratch is definitely my favorite. There are different puzzle pieces for different syntactic structures, statements and expressions in particular. The puzzle pieces are colored by the type of the expression they represent.

They have strong views on ads. They used pricing to manage the growth and avoid growing too fast. They avoided VCs as much as they could. They avoided marketing and PR, preferring to focus on the tool as much as possible. They were concerned with being able to make ends meet from early on, and only took VC to have cash in the bank as an insurance to guarantee the payroll - cash that they didn&#x27;t strictly need (they are already breaking even at the time). Jim Goetz (from Sequoia) said that it was the first time in its life that he invested in a company that was already paying corporate taxes. That&#x27;s not your usual &quot;let&#x27;s do something and see if it works&quot; kind of startup.<p>One more proof of their mindset is that they did in fact &quot;pivot&quot; early on. WhatsApp was not a messaging tool, just became to be one as they noticed that people were using status updates that way. Manhy companies with much less successful pivots talk about it as if they discovered the philosopher&#x27;s stone; in the case of WhatsApp, I&#x27;ve never heard about this pivot history before.<p>This kind of positioning goes strongly against much of today&#x27;s VC-backed business mindset.

Oh, and by the way, don't let yourself do this! But if the article was meant as introspection, it would have been written as introspection (""I find myself..."" etc)<p>Sigh.<p>Please don't quote another article with the same source in a rebuttal. It makes the discussion about the site itself instead of the particular text in question. Its smacks of fanboyism. I know I started this with my closing remarks about the site itself, but the thrust of my point is that the article was plainly suboptimal. I stand by that assessment.

Sam Walton was a billionaire, had a private jet, but he genuinely liked driving around in his pickup truck and flying his older prop airplane. Lots of folks get rich <i>because they don't spend so dang much.</i><p>That's the problem here: people who know what the hell they are talking about and disagree with you might not be counter-signaling, <i>they may actually be providing balance and some important things for you to consider to the discussion</i>.

However, even if taxation is much lower in Bolivia or Burma or Afghanistan, I doubt they'd be happier there even with 0% taxation. Happiness and disposable income are positively correlated, but not proportional, especially for higher incomes.<p>Moreover, many fortunes built in America are dependent on USA. Intel or Microsoft couldn't have been built in Albania. This co-dependence between the country and its businesses allows the former to command financial support from the later.<p>This is where the bar metaphor falls into pieces: the drinkers spend money together, but don't make this money co-dependently. If they were, the rich guy wouldn't leave because it would remove his source of income.<p>Intel couldn't relocate to Zimbabwe, hire local engineers and keep making money. It could maybe entertain the fiction that its money is made in Caiman Island or some other fiscal paradise, but that would be a gross lie; for US state representatives to tolerate such an absurd claim, some form of corruption would most likely be necessary.",1285582535

Poor form if you ask me.<p>It appears that the first meeting was focused on improving the financing options for startups whilst the second meeting appears to have focused on improving the ROI for investors.<p>Can someone explain why this is a problem?<p>If angel investors don't make a good return after risking their own capital, their funds will be diverted elsewhere (as per the rules of a capitalist system) and that is a huge disadvantage to the startup space because valuations will still decrease anyway.<p>Summary - angelgate is a non-story. Move on people. There's nothing to see here apart from another chance to procrastinate instead of working on your startup (which is highly likely to fail anyway)",1285582124

To that list, I'd add Twitter, IM, IRC, online forums/BBs/newsgroups, social news sites, talking in person, having a meeting, sleeping together, having a fight, having a meal, going out drinking, etc.<p>Each of those modes of communication is appropriate in a specific set of circumstances for a specific type of communication.

A counter would be to tell a story about one student explaining every last detail of some device and the other student still not understanding, while the GUI student just shows a picture and everything is instantly clear.<p>IMO command line ""interfaces"" are only suitable to programs.  A command line interface is basically a language for communicating with the program.  I'd rather not spend the time learning a substantial amount of the language just to be able to use the program for common tasks.<p>An example of this is revision control systems.  I always personally liked darcs but was limited to the command line interface.  When I tried out GitX I made the switch instantly after being loyal to darcs for years.  Sadly there are still things you have to use the command line for in GitX but there is no reason it has to stay that way.",1285581877

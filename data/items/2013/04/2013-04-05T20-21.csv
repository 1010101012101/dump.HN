A quick Google search for ""Bitcoin debt"" mostly yields people expounding on the virtues of a ""debt-free"" currency.  The existence of debt would complicate my example as popular opinion on monetary policy would differ. Debtors would prefer inflation while creditors and general currency holders would prefer deflation.  Either way, I still don't think something like monetary policy should be left up to crowd sourcing.",1365195509

5500999,comment,5499083,5500334,12,0,potatolicious,,,"This is a nice hypothesis but fails to account for the reality on the ground - foremost being transportation.<p>So you are displaced out of SF - great, where to? You still need to be able to get to work in the city - after all, it'd be pointless to move somewhere cheaper just to end up out of work.<p>So, let's head south. Oops, due to the overflow of demand in SF, as well as the sheer number of tech workers looking to straddle the peninsula and the city, prices down there are only slightly less insane than in the city proper.<p>Okay, let's head north - well, nope, Marin is not exactly poor man's territory.<p>West is water. Humans float, but not that well.<p>Let's head east - Oakland is rapidly being gentrified and colonized by tech workers also. On a relatively low income you can probably still scrape by - but not for long, in a year or two you'll be priced out yet again.<p>Further out? How do you get to work? The toll on the Bay Bridge is ridiculous, and it's not like you can afford parking in the city so you can <i>work</i> anyways. Your only options are along the BART, but park and rides are few and far between, and properties within non-driving distance of BART are all rising rapidly in price. Not to mention, BART fares are distance-based (rather than flat on, say, MUNI) so the further away you move the <i>more</i> expensive your commute gets! For a tech person making six figures a year the price difference isn't even noticeable - but for someone scraping by?<p>This whole problem has played out this way because San Francisco (or really, the Bay Area in general) is the most frustratingly myopic place I've ever lived when it comes to transportation. Unlike cities like Chicago or New York (or even Seattle, which is primarily bus-based), the transportation network is in such poor shape that it actively penalizes the poor. The well-heeled, like ourselves, can afford cabs and Ubers to bridge the gaps where the transportation grid fails. The poor cannot.",1365195507

However the demand for any currency is tied to the supply/demand for the total number of goods that are sold/bought with that currency.

Supply of bitcoins on the other hand is inevitably slowing down and thereby the value of bitcoins will rise towards infinity.<p>This makes it very cheap to ""import"" goods but prohibitively expensive to ""export"" any. It also provides a huge incentive not to spend or lend any money.

The whole world does not run on Bitcoin only, therefore the arguments against Bitcoin do not apply. But here is where he gets it wrong:<p><i>""but if you think about the world today, thats not true. There are plenty of currencies out there, and the supply of some of them is too low, and that hurts the people who use that currency. The fact that the dollar exists doesnt prevent the yen from being too strong.""</i><p>The author does not cite examples of people hurt by a currency when a supply is low, because  he is wrong: there are no such examples.<p>I don't know why he cites the Yen. The Japanese economy is not that bad. It is not that great either. But it is doing okay. Therefore if Japan is okay with a deflationary currency, why would not Bitcoin be okay too?<p>Or someone may cite the example of the failure of the gold standard in the US in the 1960s, but it would be incorrect. The gold standard failed because the US Federal Reserve continued to increase notes in circulation, while not replenishing gold reserves, which triggered all sorts of bad consequences, see [1]. By contrast, in Bitcoin it is algorithmically <i>impossible</i> to increase ""notes"" (coins) in circulation beyond the limit of 21M coins.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://mises.org/daily/3325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/3325</a>",1365194877

That is, when a bank makes a loan, the amount of money in the system actually increases. When the loan is paid back, the amount of money in the system decreases again.<p>This means that the amount of money can fluctuate to accomodate demand at a fixed interest rate, and it does so automatically, in a decentralized way, as part of the regular operation of the system, without any government intervention. This is why it is called <i>endogenous</i>.<p>Now, there are the goldbugs who think a fixed money supply is somehow morally superior. But my understanding is that experiments with controlling the money supply exogenously in the past, i.e. where the central bank set a fixed size of the money supply as target and tried to enforce that, resulted in a wildly volatile interest rate - simply because the demand for money is volatile, and by fixing the size of the money supply, something else had to budge.<p>For businesses, a volatile interest rate is bad because it makes planning difficult. This is why central banks now target a fixed interest rate (with volatile, endogenous money supply) - it simply is better for the economy.<p>Aside from the crazy waste of energy, this is probably the most important argument against basing the economy on Bitcoin.",1365194507

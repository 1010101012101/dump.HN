    donations to fund public goods.
</code></pre>
Actually, the Romans did just that.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedile</a><p>Note this part from the article in particular:<p><pre><code>    Because Aediles were not reimbursed for any of their public
    expenditures, most individuals who sought the office were
    independently wealthy. Since this office was a stepping stone to
    higher office and the Senate, it helped to ensure that only
    wealthy individuals (mostly landowners) would win election to
    high office.
</code></pre>
So, yes, it's <i>possible</i> to organize things that way, but the side effect is that it limits political power and offices to those who are wealthy. And, yes, the Romans also had taxes so they didn't rely on this method <i>entirely</i>, but this is an alternative model of funding public expenses without taxation and hence a counterexample to your claim.<p>On the other hand, there's a lot of money that is being spent on campaign advertisements. Perhaps it would be a net gain for society if politicians 'advertised' by spending that cash on public goods instead. Perhaps we <i>can</i> learn from the Romans. :-P",1335743820

The defining part is that geniuses seem to come by those alternatives so easily, its just always there. So for example if we devote years to programming we can tell ourselves OK, if i have a problem invoke all my years of experience and look at this problem from many different angles, we can formulate and combine our thinking into something unique that even surprises ourselves because the combination of all the data we we know to get this new idea is far greater then adding the single idea's and pieces of data that we have. Over time we can build on that to get better ideas.<p>But if i say ok, i know the method of thinking like X helps me do great things when im programming and i try to do the same for say math problems, if i havnt had the experience no matter what I tell myself, i just can not look at the problem from different perspectives or if i do, its not such a great leap, its incremental. Its still step by step, A->B not to A->C, it still follows a logical thought process and we do not surprise ourselves by our solution<p>For the genius it seems after reading something once or by some method unknown (and having no experience) they can still have all those different perspectives. Then it leaves us normal people thinking, how did they get from A->C without going through the normal steps A->B->C ... this is specially the case when the individual is very young and has managed to soak that information without college or any formal learning ...",1335742962

Can a bubble be created based on inflated seed valuations? That'd be a more interesting conversation to have. The A rounds are not trivial to raise--you still need traction, whether it's users or revenue.<p>If we are in fact in a bubble, what exactly are you going to do? Are you going to immediately start focusing on revenue, knowing that it may be harder to earn in the near future? Are you going to go out and raise your Series A/B/C right now given your 6+ months of runway left? Or are you just going to entertain the conversation? It doesn't feel like a very productive conversation to have unless you're actually acting on it right now.",1335742517

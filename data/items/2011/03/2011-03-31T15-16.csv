2392009,comment,2390816,2390816,4,0,riobard,,,"For those unfamiliar with the Nginx/Lua setup, here's the introduction:<p>""Lua-nginx-module integrated Lua into NginX, and providing high-concurrent & non-blocking request processing ability without forcing developers explicitly dividing business logics into state machine. Developers can write their programs in plain-old sequential ways, and lua-nginx-module will automatically interrupt the program logic at blockable I/O operations, save the context and delegate these I/O ops to NginXs event mechanism. When I/O ops are done, lua-nginx-module will restore the context and restore the normal running of the program logic. User program itself will feel everything as usual as never being interrupted.<p>Lua-nginx-module use one-coroutine-per-request request handling model, i.e. for each incoming request, lua-nginx-module spawns a coroutine to run user code to process the request, and the coroutine is destroyed when request handling process is done. Every coroutine has its own independent global environment, which inherits shared read-only common data. So any globals injected by user code wont affect other requests processing, and will be freed when request handling is done. You can imagine that user code is running in a sandbox, which shares the same lifecycle with request itself. By this way, lua-nginx-module can prevent memory-leak caused by the abusing of globals in user code, and improved service robustness.<p>Benefit from Luas excellant coroutine support, lua-nginx-module can handle tens of thousands of concurrent requests with very low memory overhead.

Seems like they are damned if they do, damned it they don't<p>The Motorola Xoom is already out.. so how is Honeycomb an unfinished product if it's in consumers' hands? The basic spirit of FOSS is that users and developers should be able to modify the code. The article you linked to says this:<p>>The lack of Honeycomb code availability is especially bad for enthusiasts who were hoping to be able to install custom firmware on their Android tablets. Without the code, it will be difficult for the modding community to produce custom builds that fix the software problems that plague the Xoom and other upcoming Android tablets. Users who were looking forward to better Honeycomb builds for the Nook Color and other budget devices are also going to have to wait.<p>>For now, only a privileged few hardware vendors will have access to Honeycomb while the rest are left with uncertainty about the future of the platform. Even after the matter is resolved, the fact that Google is willing to withhold source code at its whim for competitive reasons is going to continue to cast a dark shadow over the company's increasingly hollow claim that Android is an open platform.<p>I don't see how the above is wrong.<p>>The source will be released when Google is happy with the product.<p>Doesn't Android use the Linux kernel which is GPL'ed (among other parts)?

2391986,comment,2385424,2385424,1,0,rdorfner,,,"Well stated and pretty much spot on, with one exception...<p>The notion about ""Programmers who are good program all the time, even in their spare time.""<p>It has been my personal observation that this period of ""Programming is the only thing worth doing with your life"" (And yes, I know I am paraphrasing this in an unkind interpretation of what you said, I'm not doing it to be mean though, I'm doing it to illustrate a point) is true, for the first 5 to 7 or 8 years of a programmer's career.  The reason seems to be that the deep fascination with what makes programming interesting as a career, continues to hold them even in the evening hours when they are at home. When not actually programming, they talk about programming, or programming problems or some aspect of computers and computing technology, when they can find friends to talk about it with, that is.<p>However, the basic drive behind this seems to be finding out as much as you can possibly find out about your chosen field or niche within the field.  After that time period, though, something interesting happens.  The <i>MYSTERY</i> of it all, starts to fade. You begin to see patterns in how things work, and similarities in how things are done, or are implemented, or can be implemented.  Other interests start to take hold and after a while, family life starts to become important as well.  At least, for a well balanced human, it does.<p>And that, I think, becomes my major point.  The kinds of programmers who live eat breathe and drink programming, non stop, past this time period, are RARE, and usually are not well socially adjusted.<p>This is something that I think is not accounted for when interviewing more experienced software engineers. When looking at the scads of job openings for folks with 3 to 5 years of experience, your methodology and assumptions should work well, however, when you are looking for that really senior guy or gal who has been doing this for over 20 years, then the methodology, in my opinion, will not yield to you the best results.  ie. teasing out the best candidate from the stack.<p>As an aside, I once told this to a young friend of mine who I met in college. I had already been programming for nearly ten years when I returned to school to get my bachelors in CompSci.  I was always fascinated with just HOW MUCH he would go on and gush about computers, tech, sun workstations, sgi's, their hardware, their software, how to program them, linux and unix tricks etc etc..  One day I smiled and said to him. ""I'll give you 5 to 7 years, and this utter all consuming fascination with computers will tone down to seeing them as nothing more than tools.""  He denied it, vehemently, he would <i>NEVER</i>  have computers be something so mundane!  It was, about 7 years later that I got an email from him where he told me ""You were right.""  He's a googler now, and was one of the lucky ones who was in early, pre ipo and can now retire if he wants to.  I myself tried getting into google, but made some mistakes in the interview process, trying to be 'clever'. It backfired, but that's okay.  And not once did they ever ask me anything about what it is I do, or what I do best, or what I was interviewing for, board bring up, device drivers and kernel porting.  Things which I'm very good at and have done for over 25 years.<p>Anyways, just my .02, your mileage may vary!<p>Sincerely,
Richard Dorfner",1301585595

You get hardly rich writing a tech book for a traditional publisher, it is a lot of work for little money most of the time (you are not going to sell, usually, a large number of tech books, they are not ""best sellers"", and the percentage you earn is very low).<p>So after all, why not self publish? You have more control on what you write, you earn a lot more if you publish the book on the Kindle for every sold copy, you are free to provide the book for free on the web, and so forth.<p>From this point of view github is a viable way to handle the writing of a book. What is needed is a license that allows everybody to contribute, so that the electronic version is free for everybody, but only the ""main"" authors have the right to use the book for commercial purposes (Kindle, Printed, ...). Otherwise if the book is under a non free license it can be still interesting to use github in a public repository to get feedbacks, comments, and so forth.<p>We'll see what happens but my next book will be a self-published one for sure, written using a github public repo, if I'll ever write another one :)",1301584764

I very much enjoyed reading through the two references given in support of this argument -- despite neither one having much of anything to do with the technique you've supposedly been reviewing for the past 6 weeks.<p>Thank you also for claiming that our paper amounts to a bunch of code hacks and contains no theoretical contribution. Did you perchance miss the 2 pages of theorems and proofs we give in support of our work? I guess they're must have escaped your eagle eyes as you raced toward the conclusion.  Just like the page and a half of results showing an order of magnitude improvement over the current state of the art.  Clearly inconsequential next to the ""large"" 30% improvement yielded by your favourite technique -- which you went out of your way to point out to us.<p>-----<p><i>sigh</i><p>The above is obviously a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal, but I'd like to use it as a diving board into a more serious issue: namely that submitting papers to CS conferences is a crapshoot. I know I'm not alone when I say I've had bad reviews come back from obviously inexpert individuals who have  failed to understand the basic problem at hand -- much less the contribution they're supposed to be opining on.<p>When submitting to a conference, I usually take the time to look at who is on the Program Comittee. If I see names I know I'm more likely to submit there. However, more often than not, paper reviewing gets farmed out by these genuine experts onto unwitting PhD students who are simply not yet in a position to offer up a fair assessment.<p>Which brings me to my question: what's the point of being a committee member if all you're going to do is shirk your responsibilities?",1301584019

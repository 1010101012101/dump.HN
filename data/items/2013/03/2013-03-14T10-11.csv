The cryptography just enforces the consensus. In other words, ANYONE could write their own blockchain... even one that showed everyone else in the world giving all their money that person. It's just that no one would pay any attention to that blockchain... we'd all be working off the consensus view.<p>This is also why bitcoin is resistant to being controlled by ""the authorities"", but not immune to it. If someone controlled over 50% of the compute power that's doing mining and processing payments, they could change the system and ""fix"" the numbers. The fact that it is decentralized is a defense against this because (hopefully) no one entity controls a significant portion of the compute power.",1363257626

I could be way wrong, but it seems there's far less social stigma attached to holding service jobs in countries where everyone knows there are attainable, relatively straightforward to achieve, better options, compared to countries where the middle class is still much smaller and a large percentage of service workers know going in they'll be holding those types of jobs for life.",1363255431

For what it's worth, I think this was intended as an interest barometer first and funding vehicle second.<p>If I understand correctly, passing the one million mark was sufficient to bring in WB backing. Since this would probably only cover a fraction of the production costs, it feels as if they [Warner Bros] really just wanted some market research validating interest in the product.<p>> <i>Warner Brothers using Kickstarter -- or, ""forcing"" their property to do so? It just stinks, to me.</i><p>I know where you're coming from, but I don't feel the same way. The alternative, in this case, was literally nothing. The production would not have been greenlit, and fans would be left without a potentially interesting movie. Kickstarter has made this project a reality, and that's no small accomplishment.",1363255278

They don't even really see the ads.  There are sometimes parts of websites that I subconsciously filter out because I'm used to seeing ads in that area or they've made that bit look a bit too much like an ad.<p>For more extreme view-points there's the Boulder Pledge, and some people really do see any form of advertising as a type of spam.  Like I say, this is a minority extreme viewpoint, but it does exist.",1363255229

My suggestion is that if you aren't happy with your current job, practice interviewing and maybe take some online courses for stuff you don't know and you'll be much better off. Most companies in the valley look at pedigree merely for sourcing candidates; once you're in the interview it's almost entirely based on your performance.<p>You can often get the interview with a decent GitHub resume.",1363255217

Changing it to ""3 reasons why Knol will beat Wikipedia's ass"" is just plain immature and makes HN look like Digg or Reddit. We're talking about two competing companies, not a celebrity boxing match. It certainly makes it less likely anyone is going to take the article, your submissions and comments seriously.<p>If people here want to keep this place from turning into a cess pool like just about every other social news site it's up to us to keep crap like this off the front page.",1216990723

Isn't About.com and others doing the same?<p>I wouldn't be surprised if they will place Knols even above other search results in SERPS - it's their right to do so and I don't have problems with that.<p>I think Wikipedia is not threatened by this, since it's rather different service. While Wikipedia is very useful, it also has its flaws, for example it is not really open - entity is not allowed (or even persecuted publicly) for editing entry about itself. I hope Knol will not have such a restriction.<p>I have been using Wikipedia as my starting point when researching subject I know very little about. In the future I might use two starting points - Wikipedia and Knol. From user perspective, that's only good.",1216990665
256541,comment,255716,256337,0,0,condor,,,"""I don't see how anyone could argue that selling was not optimal for security. Sure, you could gradually save money, but that's not optimal; it's not more secure than getting a lump sum upfront.""<p>That's a pretty bold statement.  If you think that an offer on the table is greater than all the net income you're comfortable your company will generate (discounted to present value of course), then you would take the money and run. If on the other hand your company is creating value (net income), and you are confident it will be creating more value (net income) going forward so that the discounted future net income the company generates is way more than the upfront lump sum, you wouldn't sell and it wouldn't be more secure or optimal.  I think the issue is that most 'startup' owners aren't focusing on the net income part so they don't view their company as a cashflow generating entity which can be rationally valued against an upfront lumpsum, which means they'll take the money and run just about everytime; why wouldn't they?<p>I'm sure 37signals could have sold their company right after launching basecamp in 2004 for a multiple of revenues at the time, guessing a couple of million dollars.  However, for some reason that wasn't optimal for their security, and by 2007 (doubling revenues every year since 04) chances are they've earned/pocketed the value they could have sold the company for in 04 (if not a majority of that value) and they get to keep that cashflow generating machine going forward (which means more cashflow + more valuable equity).",1216990462

I have no problems with it or fiat currency<p>If the bank is unable to reclaim the physical money backing the loan, for example by foreclosing and reselling or having and investor cover the loss, the physical money would be destroyed. You see this happening now with banks raising money by selling equity. In other words if the loaned money bought things with no value or less value than paid then physical money is destroyed. If the loaned money buys things with more value than loaned then physical money would be created. This is simplistic description but I think accurate.<p>There has to be a mechanism for money and value creation and destruction. Money cannot be conserved. There is clearly more value/wealth and money in the world than 100 years ago.",1216990153

256528,comment,255451,256347,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"1) is simply silly, since it applies to any decision. Maybe getting a job instead of smoking weed and playing video games all day is too stressful, and maybe it will deprive you of a career as a video-gaming champ. But probably not. Maybe selecting for IQ will increase heart disease -- but a high-IQ population is more likely to deal with heart disease effectively, anyway.<p>2) Actually, people who model societies based on IQ (by, for example, taking a large sample of people and then randomly removing samples until the average IQ moves up or down a bit) have found that high IQ clearly makes things a lot better -- income is up, unemployment down, crime way down, etc. But this is complaint #1 again: ""Why improve things without knowing all the side effects?"" Because it's worth the risk, and progress is impossible if you don't.<p>3) The only serious example I've proposed is a private charity. I don't think there should be a philosophical objection to the government using eugenic policies to counter the dysgenic effects of welfare and tax systems. If you know that welfare makes irresponsible people breed, the only way to maintain equilibrium is to give them a reason not to.<p>4) There are plenty of extinct species that are pretty humanoid, but with smaller cranial capacities. often, it looks like the bigger-brained proto-humans just killed them off. In general, this optimization has worked out as a random mutation. And intelligence, unlike a peacock's tail, is about adaptability within an environment, not sexual selection within a group at the expense of the same. In fact, when you look at fertility rates compared to education (the best proxy I have, sadly -- but education correlates very well with IQ) you find that the educated ones reproduce <i>less</i> because they spend their time accomplishing other stuff.<p><i>If our technology today isn't even sufficiently advanced to make a college admissions test that predicts academic performance</i><p>You're referring to the low correlation between SATs and college performance, right? And you're ignoring that schools select people on multiple criteria, including SATs, such that everyone is at about the same level academically. So Smith's SATs show he's great at math, but a mediocre writer. And Jones' SATs show he's not too bright, but his admissions essay is jaw-dropping. Smith double-majors in math and CS; Jones majors in philosophy. They can get the same GPA even though they have different SATs, because the SAT is one of several criteria on which they're selected. The other obvious example is a student with high SATs and a poor GPA (smart, but no work ethic) versus the opposite; they could perform at about the same level, in the same school, but only because the high-SAT, low-GPA student is at the bottom of his SAT cohort, and the other student is at the top of his.<p>Also, it was nice of you to just focus on college performance. As far as I know, IQ test results predict income, fertility, crime and civic participation better than any other variable measurable from childhood. Could be environmental, of course, but most of the tweaks for raising IQ seem to be temporary -- the only known ways to raise IQ into adulthood seem to be having smarter parents and getting proper nutrition.<p>Of course, I don't think we should breed as a policy. It's enough to admit that such a policy is possible, probably beneficial, but perhaps not worth the total costs. I'm glad you're able to consider it rationally.",1216989470

Math was my main subject at the University, so while I work as a software developer, on paper I am a mathematician.<p>I don't agree with the premise that math is an art, and that ""Better to not have math classes at all than to do what is currently being done."" First and foremost, Math is something which learns one to <i>think abstractly</i> in patterns. And this I believe is indispensable and useful for almost everyone - even if the concrete pieces of knowledge will be forgotten later or not directly applicable to one's work or life. Even the so-called ""drill"" is somewhat useful.<p>Also, during my work in software companies, I was able to notice when someone didn't receive solid Math at university level - they were lacking in the area of their ability to think more abstractly and thoroughly about more complex problems.<p>Of course, the education could be improved by having better teachers with passion and ability to explain the ideas, no doubt about that.",1216989188

256518,comment,256176,256176,0,0,rkts,,,"I agree with this to some extent, but I think the author goes too far.  The purpose of math education is not to make theoretical mathematicians.  Only a small number of students in math classes will become mathematicians, and the rest are acquiring a set of tools that they'll use to solve problems in the real world.  Proofs and conjectures and abstract reasoning, interesting as they may be, are irrelevant to most people's needs.<p>Here's a better analogy: a mathematician is a composer, and people who use math are singers and instrumentalists.  There will always be a few people who love composing, and their work is important.  But the majority of people have neither the ability nor the motivation to write original compositions.  They'd rather just be given music to play.<p>For the composers among us, this can be hard to stomach.  Writing music is so exhilarating, and playing is so mundane!  How can anyone prefer the latter to the former?  Well, the fact is, most people do.  The rest of humanity really is different from us, and we need to accept that.",1216988499

It provides isolation for processes etc., but uses less resources than a full virtual machine. It is limited in that it has to be the same operating system as the host.",1421297958

8890951,comment,8889904,8890882,0,0,freerobby,,,"Physical, by far.<p>The number of people who lead climb multipitch walls is much bigger than the number who can climb a single 5.14 pitch, even on a toprope in a gym.<p>Keep in mind that these climbers spend years relying on their gear and taking no shortage of falls. They trust themselves and their partners. I don&#x27;t want to minimize the mental challenge here (I struggle with it when I lead climb in a gym, let alone &quot;trad&quot; outside with my own gear), but for climbers at this level with this much experience, the fear of falling is sufficiently small that they&#x27;re thinking about the climb rather than the consequences of a misstep.<p>Climbing 5.14 pitches is a whole other story. Perfect technique isn&#x27;t enough; you also need a perfect physique -- lean and muscular in all the right places -- and not muscular in the wrong places, because muscle is heavy. Conventional climbing wisdom is that persistent hard work can take a fit person a long way -- to about 5.12 or so -- but after that it comes down to genetics. I&#x27;m reasonably athletic, have been climbing on and off for over a decade, and multiple times per week for the last 18 months. I&#x27;ll be ecstatic if I can ever do a single 5.13 pitch.",1421297744

8890937,comment,8887349,8887349,0,0,pdm55,,,"I&#x27;m confused. (It easily happens). How does adding an iron (Fe) object to a cooking pot increase intake of iron ions (Fe 2+). Note that I am saying Fe(2+) intake. As I understand it, haemoglobin has an Fe(2+) ion trapped in it&#x27;s structure. This is required for the uptake of oxygen molecules (O2) from the lungs, carrying it in the blood stream and releasing it at sites where there is an oxygen deficit. This is a long way of saying that Fe (2+) is utilised by the body, not Fe. If this is unclear, think in terms of sodium. We use sodium ions (Na+) not sodium atoms (Na). We put NaCl on our food, not Na. Na is very reactive and would react violently with our moist skin. We know that once it loses its electron to chlorine, a similarly highly reactive element, and becomes Na+ (in combination with Cl-) it is in an unreactive form and is used by the body for propagation of impulses along nerves. Back to Fe (2+). I guess that talking about Fe is just an imprecise way of talking about our need for Fe2+. The question then in my mind is &quot;How does the Fe added to the cooking pot become Fe(2+)?&quot; Does it just become oxidised to iron oxide (FeO,Fe2O3, Fe3O4?). I am trying to think what would a soluble form of Fe2+. Wikipedia lists these as insoluble. Perhaps salt is required in the cooking pot and iron chloride Fe2+ Cl2- is formed. But I cannot see Fe winning in a charity tustle with sodium for the donation of it&#x27;s electrons to chlorine. Maybe, the formation of iron oxides are an interim step. Who knows?",1421297473

This isn&#x27;t so different from other sports, they just have a different mix. A golfer needs a lot of technical skill, and a bit of strength, plus some emotional strength, to get through those tough shots. Can you think of a sport that requires less physical strength? How about a very intense gamer?<p>Emotional strength is a huge part of climbing. Think about it: you&#x27;re 1,000+ feet in the air. The last piece of protection you have is over 10 feet below you - meaning, if you fall, you fall twice that distance. There&#x27;s a slight chance that the protection that you&#x27;ve placed could in fact come off, as you fall, making you fall even farther (say, another 20 feet!). Can you keep it together, to make the move upwards, or are you going to freeze, thinking about what could happen? A fall of 20 feet isn&#x27;t going to be fatal, but it could be pretty messy, if you get tangled in your rope. Now (in the case of the Dawn Wall), you&#x27;ve been working on this project for over 7 years. When do you say, &quot;enough!&quot; and move on?

Surgery is something else entirely... if you go to a large, academic center, you will only be seen by surgeons that specialize in that procedure.

The alternative cable company that serves our area on the other hand has weekly and monthly outages, and I regret to say, that&#x27;s not even purely a residential deployment issue.<p>In Waterloo, IA, our neighboring town, the city council initially approved then backed out of working with Cedar Falls to participate in a greater municipal fiber deployment. Following a storm in 2009 that damaged utility lines on poles, I believe Cedar Falls moved forward with their plans to deploy fiber and deployed service to almost all homes over the course of a year and a half. The transition was seamless, and since then bandwidth has more than quintupled for the regular tier. I get 50/25 and it&#x27;s rock solid. The best internet service I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>On the other hand, as an IT consultant I have businesses I work with in Waterloo. Some of them would like to switch to technologies like VOIP to reduce costs, but their Mediacom cable goes down on a weekly basis. I have one client for whom I have never seen a whole month of uptime, and they have had multiple business days without service in the past year. The only alternative for most of my clients is CenturyLink DSL, which hardly qualifies as broadband with most of the DSLAMs too widely distributed and over-subscribed for reliable throughput.<p>Mediacom is the same company that signed a letter to congress decrying municipal investment, and published a press release today[1] about how insulting it was that the President chose to support a municipal utility instead of their investment in Iowa.<p>If companies like Mediacom and Century Link really cared about providing a service, they would support Title II and competition. But they don&#x27;t. The high barrier to entry suits them just fine, and as a result, internet options are terrible in Waterloo, and technology businesses have fled to Cedar Falls. We&#x27;ve even apparently been named the &quot;Digital Capital&quot; by Google (but I have no idea what that means, I personally think Des Moines has the best access to the backbone with Microsoft and Facebook both opening up datacenters there).<p>Sure, our gigabit fiber isn&#x27;t $70 here, like Google offered, but it&#x27;s there. And my internet service has never been more reliable. I know people who have Mediacom and Centurylink, and they hate it. And unlike their press release speaks about, the fiber deployment wasn&#x27;t financially unsustainable or a waste of taxpayer dollars. As Mediacom says, &quot;there is no reason to invest even more government dollars in municipally-owned broadband ventures, many of which wind up in financial difficulty.&quot;<p>Well, I&#x27;m curious if Mr. Commisso of Mediacom did any fact checking. CFU is self-funded. Even better, CFU actually contributes back to the city&#x27;s general fund its excess revenue. It&#x27;s not so much &quot;spending taxpayer money&quot; as it is saving, at least now that it&#x27;s up and running.<p>Edited in addendum: Oh yeah, and for something the network engineers here might approve of: even when torrenting at 50mbps, my latency to Google and Microsoft is unchanged (10-13ms) and there appears to be little or no bufferbloat causing congestion. I&#x27;ve been able to play competitive real-time games and Skype while streaming, downloading, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150114006231/en/Mediacom-Communications-Issues-Statement-President-Obama%E2%80%99s-Visit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150114006231/en/Medi...</a>",1421295263

First you are put in a bin, then the doctor basically runs you through a check list.<p>It&#x27;s really unfortunate that nearly 100% of the bins are disease or a disorder. A typical interaction with a doctor involves finding out which disease bin you should be in, and then putting you in there. Once you&#x27;re there, they&#x27;re not concerned with making you healthier, or looking at the variety of options that could improve your life. They&#x27;re just concerned with doing the standard operating procedure for dealing with the disease. Instead of being a person, the patient becomes a checklist.<p>Many doctors don&#x27;t even see you. They see the bin you&#x27;re in, and the many potential bins you could potentially be in.<p>What if half the bins were about great physical health?

The solution that leaps to my mind is to use a locality-sensitive hash function.  It would make search stochastic, which means reversing the encoding would be easier.  Seems like any hash-based solution will involve a tradeoff between 1 and 2.<p>What did you have in mind?  ",1196314663

That's why high tech inventions are mostly happens in U.S.

Do people have a fundamental right to raise a family in San Francisco rather than Omaha or Austin?  Are other places so horrible that we should use taxpayer money to ensure that the largest number of people possible can live in SF?  And we should make it easier for the moderately low income to live here rather than people with higher income because ... why?  Because people who work in technology don&#x27;t deserve to raise their families here?  Because despite education and hard work we really should make the ability to raise a family in a great area a random selection?<p>I actually think the car analogy is useful.  Not subsidizing housing in San Francisco does not deny people the ability to start families.  They can still start them in many other fine places that they can afford.  Not driving a BMW or Tesla doesn&#x27;t deny people the ability to get to work.  A Honda or Toyota does that just as well.<p>NOTE: &quot;Affordable housing&quot; does not apply exclusively to people who have lived in the area for N years previously as far as I know, and even if it did I don&#x27;t see why that would be fair.  If you rent, you rent.  When your lease is up, if the price goes up, that&#x27;s how rent works.  Also, there are already rent control policies that would serve this purpose.",1390013995

7079839,comment,7075537,7076905,7,0,nrivadeneira,,,"I once read something that Tim Ferriss had said in response to a similar question. I&#x27;m heavily paraphrasing, but he was basically asked how he had so much more discipline than most others.<p>He responded by saying that he doesn&#x27;t have more discipline - he just creates environments that decrease his opportunities to fail (ie. get distracted) and increase his likelihood to succeed (ie. finish the work).<p>The idea is to not trust yourself and not give yourself the opportunity to fail. A concrete example of how I&#x27;ve personally put this to great use in my life is how I made it a habit to go to the gym:<p>When I was in college, I wanted to go to the gym regularly. Unfortunately I found that when I was in my dorm room and needed to get ready for the gym, I lacked the motivation to get out of a comfortable situation. What I began doing was taking my gym clothes to class and going straight to the gym after class. This required significantly less motivation on my part because I was already walking around campus, sometimes even passing the gym by on the way back to my dorm. The step leading up to that also required very little motivation - putting clothes in your backpack. The result was that I created a sequence of events that each had a small likelihood of failure. 10 years later, going to the gym is my favorite hobby.<p>Another example related to getting work done came about when I was trying to work on my side projects from home. It never worked. I&#x27;d always want to browse the internet, watch tv, play video games, or spend time with my girlfriend. Starting work when my Xbox was in the next room meant summoning a monumental amount of motivation. Instead what I started doing was going to a local coffee shop or coworking space. It doesn&#x27;t take that much effort to just go to a public space with wifi (and if it does, you can use the advice above). Once there, you have put yourself in an environment where everyone else is working. Aside from noise, there are fewer distractions. In addition, you&#x27;ll look like an asshole if you&#x27;re sitting in front of your laptop playing on Reddit for 4 hours while everyone around you is getting shit done.<p>If you can make a habit of completing those small triggers that lead to bigger outcomes, you&#x27;ll eventually have gained a much more significant habit.",1390013542

7079834,comment,7079547,7079547,9,0,mgraczyk,,,"I&#x27;m generally very skeptical of authors or papers that make claims about &quot;quantum processes&quot; and consciousness because they are generally written by people who know very little about neurology and even less about quantum physics.  Ask them about quantum entanglement, and you&#x27;ll generally get a misguided interpretation based on a decades old mistake in reasoning that has long since been corrected [1][2].  However, I decided to give this paper a try not because I expected there to be any actual content, but just to see why otherwise intelligent people would be drawn to what I consider to be obvious pseudoscience.<p>I didn&#x27;t read the whole thing, but from what I know of quantum mechanics and QFT (standard undergraduate course load) I didn&#x27;t see anything wildly misguided.  This tells me that one of two things are true.<p>1. This paper describes a legitimate link between a non-classical process occurring in the brain that may &quot;cause&quot; consciousness.  I do not know enough about the brain to rigorously evaluate the claims.<p>2 (more likely). Quantum physics is hard, even for scientists.  Neither of the paper&#x27;s author&#x27;s are physicists, and neither have done any _recent_ meaningful work in any subfield of physics.  I would expect that groundbreaking work in physics would require ideas beyond an undergraduate level, but I did not see any physics in the paper I didn&#x27;t understand. It looks like at the very least, there is room for a false positive.  What I mean by &quot;false positive&quot; is that sometimes not about A will cause you to reason that Q->C even when the truth is A->Q and A->C (correlation does not imply causation...).  For example, it could be that the electrical signals of the brain that cause consciousnes + quantum effect, but if the same signals were running through a semiconductor we would instead see a different quantum effect (depletion zones, electron holes...).  If our brains were made of 5nm CMOS transistors, a non-physicist might see quantum tunneling and conclude that it somehow caused consciousness.<p>I think the most important thing for non-physicists like me to remember about papers like this is that although sometimes scientists make important discoveries outside their fields we should allow specialists in the area to evaluate the non-physicists claims before believing them ourselves.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mysticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mysticism</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/76036/how-does-qft-help-with-entanglement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/76036/how-does-qf...</a><p><i>EDIT</i><p>Penrose did important work on the nature of black holes ~40 years ago.

There wasn&#x27;t another reason to presuppose it. So the fact that the activity exists <i>does</i> have information content with respect to the central thesis. It certainly doesn&#x27;t prove it, but it moves the needle.<p>Analogy: Suppose the Earth is covered with clouds and we have never seen the sky, we have not invented space ships yet, etc. Nobody knows why tides happen. Someday someone predicts there is a GIANT rock orbiting the Earth not too far away, and everyone says that is crazy. But eventually you send a rocket up with a camera, and you see this giant rock there! Whoa. Since the tides caused you to look for the rock, and you found the rock, you have reason to suspect the rock does cause the tides. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t -- further verification is required.

State-subsidized &quot;below market rate&quot; housing that enables people with low salaries to occupy highly-demanded space is incredibly inefficient and also likely doesn&#x27;t serve the interests of the people it is supposed to help.<p>I don&#x27;t see why the ability to live in San Francisco is any different than the ability to afford a BMW or a Tesla.  Should the government subsidize &quot;below market rate&quot; luxury cars too?  What would be the incentive to get an education or work hard?  Personally I feel somewhat offended when there are dozens of below market rate units available and I&#x27;m actually excluded from attempting to buy them because I earn too much money.  Meanwhile there are hardly any homes available for people who can afford the houses without subsidies and we bid up the houses to obscene prices due to lack of supply.<p>Also, if the people who work in SF or other high income areas cannot afford to live there at current wages, there should be pressure on them to leave and work elsewhere.  This would increase demand for their labor and drive prices up, all else being equal.  (I know, there are other factors here, but those should be dealt with separately, not by adding more layers of complexity to the problem.)<p>Further, if those workers cannot afford to rent or buy, lowering the cost of renting or buying also reduces the pressure on employers to raise their wages.",1390012859

Marketers use it to make money by making sure you see the best ad for you, the NSA uses it to make money by &#x27;stopping terrorists&#x27;. But what if all the data was free and the programs turing it into useful information were open-sourced? That would change the market entirely. Anyone could see the most important scraped news of the day, whether its a terrorist threat or just thrending news. It could be like a social network that everybody has already joined. Privacy would be interesting. Maybe you could only see from others what you choose to share yourself. But thats too long to get into here...<p>Clearly what needs to be done is this: the data that the NSA collects should only be accessible by the program. It needs to be fully autonomous. The biggest concern with the vast collection of data and secrets is the human element. So we should simply take the human element out of it. Make an open-sourced program and algorithm that reads the data when it needs to and automatically gets the results to those who need to see it.

7079728,comment,7076294,7078863,21,0,richardfontana,,,"This is incorrect. Canonical formerly used a (non-joint) copyright assignment agreement, which was widely criticized. It later sponsored the Harmony project which was an unsuccessful effort to popularize a standardized suite of contributor agreements. When the Harmony agreements were released in 2011, Canonical began using one of the Harmony CLAs. It doesn&#x27;t stipulate copyright assignment; rather, the contributor grants Canonical a broad copyright license that is similar in effect to copyright assignment except that the contributor\nretains copyright ownership of the contribution. It is not dissimilar in policy to the widely-used Apache model of CLAs. I&#x27;m a strong critic of CLAs generally, particularly these types, but they ought to be described accurately. The effect of use of such CLAs by entities that will (by employment of a majority of developers, say) hold copyright over much of a relevant codebase is that you have little pieces of code that are owned by outside contributors but licensed in under\nmaximally broad terms which basically give the inbound entity the ability to do whatever they want with the code, short of assigning copyright in it.<p>> Even RedHat requires you to sign a similar CLA in order to accept contributions for Fedora, 389 Directory Server (LDAP), etc.<p>No (with some legacy use of Apache-style CLAs basically confined to some JBoss projects and gradually being dismantled).<p>I&#x27;ve been Red Hat&#x27;s open source lawyer since 2008 so I think I can speak authoritatively on this. Red Hat does <i>not</i> use a similar CLA for contributions to Fedora (though at least nominally it used an Apache-style CLA prior to 2010). Since 2010 Fedora account holders agree to the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (<a href=""http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contribut...</a>) which is a simple agreement that says code is licensed by default under the MIT license (and content under CC BY-SA) unless the contributor indicates otherwise. 389 basically followed the Fedora approach for reasons best understood as historical inertia (by coincidence I noticed last night there is some incorrect information\nabout this on the 389 website).<p>Red Hat starts up tons of open source projects, and most of them do not require contributor agreements. When I got to Red Hat in 2008 this was already the case, if only because of the nature of Red Hat&#x27;s culture at the time. But the company was on the verge of applying a uniform (Apache-style) CLA requirement across all Red Hat-maintained projects -- much like so many companies do today. I very soon realized how problematic that would be and I think one of my big accomplishments was not only to stop that from happening but also to reverse it (the trend for that set of projects that used CLAs in the past has been to get rid of them), and to formulate a strong legal-policy basis for doing so, maybe best recorded in my two-part critique of the Harmony contributor agreement suite in 2011: <a href=""http://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-1</a> .<p>So please do not use Red Hat as evidence of support for use of broad contributee-friendly contributor agreements. Red Hat has been the leading company, maybe the only company, articulating an alternative viewpoint.<p>[Edited to fix formatting and to tone down initial scorn slightly]\n[Edited to acknowledge JBoss situation]\n[Edited to note Harmony agreements unsuccessful in that few use them]",1390011126

Unfortunately, I saw neither, and the amendment was summarized using inflammatory language.  Unless Sen. Franken is trying to gauge public support for his idea, I fear that signing his petition would be nothing but slacktivism.",1390010524

Also, all the usual caveats about respecting privacy apply.  I find there are very few of these types of ads around these days. Google text ads used to be this way, but then they started injecting them into SERPs in such a way that they looked more like results than ads.  Also, popunders and popups need not apply: they make my whole browser unusable, and that&#x27;s unacceptable.<p>In addition to individual ads needing to be unobtrusive, the totality of the ads on the page needs to not make the page unusable.  This is the thing that annoys me about Youtube ads, for the most part.  I visit youtube to watch videos, and if I have to sit through an ad every time before I can do that, I start to get annoyed.<p>This isn&#x27;t the same as how TV ads work, either.  Sure, each ad is 30 seconds, and together they make an hour worth of programming equal to about 42 minutes of content, but each commercial break is a few minutes long, which makes them effectively skippable.  Imagine if a commercial break were 1 minute long (so there were 18 of them per hour).  Wouldn&#x27;t that get annoying fast?",1390010478

I'd give it a shot with an open mind for a day or two.<p>It's fantastic on a multi-monitor setup; the start screen and full screen apps can be anchored to one screen.  So if you want to read a PDF full screen, for example, while doing desktop work on another, it works very well.<p>Also, you can have multiple task bars on multiple screens if you want.  And you can do almost everything with the keyboard that I used to use the mouse for.<p>If you miss the start menu, try this: hit the windows key and start typing the name of the program you want to open.",1345564799

In my experience it's aimed at the site. They're trying to lock out N% of users. In which case going for common names, email addresses, etc. will get you a surprisingly large chunk of the user base.<p>And that's ignoring the many sites where usernames are public, or easily accessible by a ""normal"" user that can be used to scrape them for the DOS/password bot.<p><i>Therefore, I would say that having a lockout mechanism is better than not having one.</i><p>Since I've seen DOS attacks that use them - I'd tend to disagree :-)<p>Unless you're in an environment that makes them effective.<p>For example my bank uses a lockout - but it has a private customer number that's not visible to others, along with a separate password and a 8 digit PIN (of which it only asks for three random digits). It's only when two of the three bits of information are correct that the lockout count starts - making bulk lockouts for the site pretty much impossible. So there it's an effective tool to prevent password cracking.",1345564685

As far as I can tell, biohackers are all adventurous young people, incredibly athletic, and theyre all traveling the world.</i><p>If you reflect on a creator's willingness to work outside of polite society, the web seems so very static and conservative now. I am not necessarily comparing it to some bygone days where hackers were cowboys, because I only recently discovered the web - I'm comparing it to the potential of any community.<p>Impressionist painters in the 1870's struck out in defiance of the academic community. Sculpture followed twenty or so years on. Architecture made equally bold moves counter to the norm and expectations. All of these are conservative arts now for the most part. One of the most popular trends now in architecture is the International Style of  80 years ago.<p>Every so often a new field erupts that is democratic and allows the novitiate to explore and express (and to be honest about the human condition and not play politics to preserve one's rank). The web had that potential, but I don't see it being fulfilled.<p>[EDIT] It is interesting to find this piece on Brand, who I know best through his How Buildings Learn, which is one of the best works I've read on man's place in the built environment: he studies the historical records of structures that have survived man's use, and identified the general attributes that contribute to those successes. It is an empirical view of architecture and by extension, planning. It is a conservative view, in that it values the preservation of things past, but it is a liberal view in that it seeks the freedom of the building and tenant.",1345564502

4413201,comment,4412905,4413060,13,0,Silhouette,,,"Sad, but true. Faced with the reality that well-designed, flexible, modular systems have simply become too good, manufacturers are now effectively building in forced obsolescence, either tying components together (the Apple way) or arbitrarily declaring that only certain combinations are permitted (which also works with consumables, like the way my HP colour printer refused to print a black and white document the other day until I replaced an empty colour toner cartridge).<p>Software seems to be going the same way. SaaS is a fairly transparent rip-off in many cases. Certain big-ticket professional software vendors restrict sales to a network of resellers they can control, who dutifully pull last year's version as soon as this year's is available, so if you want to buy an extra copy to go with the 10 you already have, you can't (unless you upgrade your entire organisation to maintain compatibility).<p>Bridging the gap nicely are drivers. Here we see a range of dubious techniques. One popular one seems to be releasing equipment with drivers for certian specific operating systems that are available at the time, but then conveniently not releasing any drivers to support new operating systems released within what would otherwise be the normal lifetime of the device, thus artificially shortening its life often by many years. Another good trick (I'm looking at you nVidia) is to take essentially the same hardware, but sell one version with nerfed drivers and another premium (sorry, ""workstation"") version with ""certified"" drivers that actually use the hardware to its full capabilities.<p>I'm a little surprised that we haven't yet seen more people pushing back against these obviously customer-hostile trends, because a lot of people are spending a lot more money and suffering a lot more hassle than they should have to. Certainly some rip-off merchants do come unstuck; I've heard about what would have been extremely lucrative sales of very expensive specialist equipment that got flushed when the prospective customer discovered some form of artificial nerfing in software and took their cash to someone else who didn't do that. But it seems that everyday hardware and software are in one big race to the bottom.<p>Even premium products, like those high-end graphics cards and professional software installations with their multi-thousand price tags per unit, seem to be tolerated because <i>almost everyone</i> is doing it now. Perhaps this is partly because the more honest competition mostly comes from smaller organisations in the hardware field or in software's case via independent software houses and open source communities, and these kinds of suppliers are (rightly or wrongly, probably a bit of both) regarded as not being up to the job of supplying Serious Business Customers(TM).<p>What I haven't yet figured out is why this is still happening. Do you know anyone who, in either a personal or a professional capacity, actually thinks any of this stuff is done to help them, or that spending money on these things is a good deal? In a logical market, we would expect competition to spring up and exploit that vulnerability, promoting brands based on honest dealings and good quality, almost certainly charging a higher price for it, but with a greater perceived value that justifies that price. And yet, this doesn't seem to be happening, which suggests that many of the markets in technology industries are not effectively competitive, or some of the big name players are in practice dominant or outright monopolies even if they're not formally recognised as such.",1345563861

It also imposes request digests including a timestamp parameter, which prevents replays and doesn't permit forged requests if you manage to intercept an unencrypted request.<p>OAuth2 is arguably <i>less secure</i> than OAuth, because as it's being used by Instagram, the whole kit and kaboodle is wrapped up in the bearer token, which is wholly reliant on TLS for its secrecy.<p>Corporate network with a custom CA installed? Your account is theirs (seriously, your employer doesn't have to ask for your Facebook password to spy on you, they just have to make sure their proxy's CA is installed on your work-issued machine, and they can crack your Facebook account open like a pinata). Cert issued from a bad CA anywhere between you and the target server? Your account is theirs. Any breach in the host's enforcing of TLS? you've just leaked full access to your account to anyone that's listening. Hell, even an XSS breach can result in a leaked bearer token.<p>Oh, and guess what? You can still suck an auth token out of memory and use it to forge requests. And you can still suck the OAuth2 keys out of the package or memory or whatever and use them to forge authentication requests. The exact same issue exists for OAuth2 (and Instagram's usage of it) that exists for OAuth.  Implicit authentication flow is great, but the core problem of ""I can crack open your app, take your client ID, and use it to create authentication requests for my app while masquerading as you"" still exists. With OAuth, you also have to steal a client secret in addition to a client ID, but the end result is the same.<p>OAuth2 is a lot more friendly than OAuth for client developers, I'll grant that, but it's just flat wrong to argue that it has some mystical protections against the problem that aren't present in OAuth.",1345562767

They really need to get it together before branding themselves under one of the most popular sites on the web.<p>As an example, the first course I looked into had zero follow-up courses or suggestions for the students to keep learning past the initial introductory lessons despite comments asking for them (the 'professor' said he had no plans to take it any further). The documentation was overly complicated for the sake of sounding smart and the text was written in some awful thin, monospaced font. I didn't go through it enough to see if it was certifiable, but I'd venture to guess that if the author couldn't even bother to include supplementary resources, they probably aren't suited to teach. There wasn't even a preface about who the professor was, why they were qualified, and links to some stuff they've done.<p>For a project so ambitious and trusting of the capacities of volunteers, they need to require that these people commit. Outline two or three courses, meet content deadlines before the course is public, have them vetted by people in the appropriate subreddits and then offer a pool those students can wade in afterwards to continue sharing their progress with each other and to act as a promotional tool for the courses/professor.<p>Is anyone doing truly crowdsourced education?",1345562658

I want to add ""being beautiful"" to the list because I think it will help me express my point that I want to make.<p>I believe that most people can improve on most skills, and that improvement is correlated to the time and effort they put into it. I believe that ""being beautiful"" counts among these skills along with ""playing music"" and ""doing ballet"". The reason I added ""being beautiful"" to the list is because I have found an attitude among many people, even those with a ""growther"" mindset, that treats beauty as static. I argue that the general expectations (or at least the projected expectations, which to the projecting person is the same thing) is unreasonable, causing many people to think of their improvements as failures because they fall short of those unreasonable expectations.<p>So if one defines the ability to ""play music"" as the ability to produce live music that is on par with best-selling recordings, then I argue that no, the average person cannot ""play music"". Likewise if one defines the ability to ""be beautiful"" as the ability to look as flawless as the final product in the Dove evolution commercial. I find definitions like these to be unreasonable because these definition/expectations discourage the average person to try to play music or be beautiful when it may bring them and the people around them much joy.<p>I hope that you are right that people can shed these expectations and do things for the fun of it. I see signs of it in music too.",1345562645

4413069,comment,4405890,4405890,1,0,rfreebern,,,"There's a lot of back-and-forth in this discussion about whether real-time communication is good or bad, and whether the responsibility for dealing with it lies with the content producer or the end user. I think the optimal solution lies somewhere in the middle: content producers need to be respectful of users' limitations (time, energy, attention, etc.) and users have to understand and communicate those limitations. Real-time communication is merely a tool, and like any other, it can be used well (for things like important events that are occurring now) or poorly (because who really needs to know instantly when an acquaintance listens to a new dubstep remix?).<p>The concept of the Slow Web is catching on precisely because, as technology has matured, the idea of real-time communications has become the default, and as a result, using nearly any service exposes you to a bombardment of information. Technologically, it's easy: something happens, so you immediately fire off an email or trigger a push notification. Why wait? Why bother implementing a queue or a summary when it's so simple to just do it now?<p>Yes, users can always opt out, but often doing so means you either have to opt out of the service entirely (thereby losing the ability to benefit from it at all) or that the service falls out of your consciousness because they have no setting between ""firehose"" and ""off"", and there are so many other things demanding your attention.<p>Especially when services are ad-driven, they want to find ways to keep getting your attention. Every time they notify you of an update and you load the page, that's an ad impression. Every time you're prompted to share something and it gets a friend of yours to sign up, that's a new data point for advertisers. They have a vested interest in pulling your attention away from whatever you're doing and back to themselves, and real-time communication makes that easier.<p>You can choose to ignore notifications or put them off until later, but the fact that they're sitting there with unread information is often difficult to ignore. The fear of missing out drives us to keep checking; the fact that every fifth or eighth or twelfth tweet makes us laugh or think is partial reinforcement that drives us to try to read every one. Opting out through willpower alone is more difficult than it seems for most people.",1345562513

Those courses only have to be recorded once to be enjoyed by an unlimited number of people. You don't get those economies of scale with traditional education--of course you don't get nearly as much access to the instructor either.

""<p>Isn't humor, it is critique. It is also wrong.<p>It isn't irony (the word you were going for is paradoxical) there isn't a 'democracy' and there isn't a 'plutocracy'. So when you start that way it sounds like you were going for profound but missed.<p>My suggestion, if you're open to it, is to actually write what you think you mean. Don't try to make it sound 'smart' just try to make it clear. Use rhetoric you are comfortable with and try to write it at the 'top level' first, which is to say don't try to embed any clever subtext. If you're going to be cynical you should be able to cite examples.<p>Re-reading it again you're entry says:
1) I'm (the writer) sad<p>2) I don't understand the Silicon Valley ecosystem.<p>3) I think people writing about technology are tools and that is part of the problem.<p>4) I am not like these people who don't have morals I'm going to only write truth.<p>5) Join my quest but sending all your press releases to me.<p>Now, if you've been successful at communicating your message to me through your blog (and it is always possible you haven't and I've misread it) then it might have easily been a single paragraph thusly,<p>""My impression of Silicon Valley is that startups, VCs, and journalists [inadvertently?] collude on creating an understanding of what is worth doing and what isn't. That collusion harms innovation by not giving voice to ideas outside the group. In this blog I'm going to try to look at the ideas that others don't, and bring them to your attention. To avoid conflicts of interest, I don't monetize this content.""<p>If I did correctly read your intent, then it would also help if you provided an argument [1] for this group think you feel is pervasive since that would help people know if you were worth reading, and finally the whole monetization thing is non-obvious.

For my Mathematics degree at the University of Cambridge, about as highly respected as they come, your grade is determined entirely[1] by the end-of-year exams; four three-hour exams each year. Frequently the very best students won't bother to attend lectures, supervisions or any formal teaching, and that's absolutely fine[2]; as long as you pass the exams, you get the degree[3]. It would be entirely plausible for a student to learn the course solely from free, online sources and get the degree solely on the results of that.<p>You still need that set of high-quality exams and marking, but those could be provided a lot cheaper than the cost of a full university education, even a ""traditional online university"" (in so far as such a concept makes sense).<p>[1] Strictly in the second and third years you can opt to replace around half an exam with a programming project
[2] At an administrative level you should keep your director of studies and your tutor happy that you are going to be able to pass the exams; usually this is on the basis of your supervision reports, but it doesn't have to be. If they don't think you're going to pass they will advise you to drop out, but I've not heard of anyone being compelled to do so
[3] Technically you are also required to have spent a certain number of nights and eaten a certain number of dinners in college, but I don't believe this is enforced",1345561813

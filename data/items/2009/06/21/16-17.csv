But it (or, more precisely, the science and techniques developed to accomplish it) is easily as important as the other things you listed.  The HGP is to the discovery of DNA as quantum mechanics is to the discovery of the atom.<p>And you're being overly reductive when you say the Grand Challenge is a ""pretty natural extension of Turing, Von Neumann, etc.'s"".

From memory, research on transistors began well before Bell Labs had a hand in their development, IBM didn't give us the relational database; the honor belongs to a university I've long since forgotten. Oh, and Microsoft is funding <i>some</i> of the work on functional programming.<p>That aside, I agree with your second para.",1206363501

Sure in a large company it's difficult to make the types of decisions that will affect the whole organisation. On the other hand in a small company you are typically very restricted in terms of the numbers of users who you can make a positive difference on their lives.<p>Startups are typically experiments to see if there is any mass appeal.

When a Service is scheduled, it is only allowed to run while resources (battery, CPU, memory) are sufficient to keep the critical processes (currently visible UI, current application) running. The OS has permission to kill off background Services without warning as needed to preserve the user experience.<p>No, the reason with Apple is simply political.",1206363069

144507,story,,,6,13,sanj,"John Gruber's take on iPhone background apps",http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/march#fri-21-jens,"from http://daringfireball.net/<p>direct sublink is: http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/march#fri-21-jens<p>""Another one from the I-don’t-agree-with-it-but-it’s-well-worth-reading dept.<p>For what it’s worth, I believe the number one reason why the iPhone OS doesn’t allow background processes is RAM. Battery life, CPU sharing, bandwidth — all of these are factors, too, but I think RAM is foremost. The iPhone has just 128 MB of RAM and no swap space. A good chunk of that 128 MB goes to the OS itself and the built-in apps that do run in the background — Phone, Mail, Safari, and iPod. There really just isn’t much left over. If Apple were to just allow background processing now, what would happen is that background processes would often wind up getting killed by the OS at some point when the frontmost app needs more memory. From the user’s perspective, it would seem as though background apps inevitably mysteriously fail and stop running. You can argue that you’d rather have that than no third-party background apps at all, but it’s clearly a reasonable trade-off for Apple in terms of consistency and obviousness in the user experience.<p>Wait a few years for iPhones with 1 GB of RAM and it’ll be a different story.""",1206362318

144503,comment,143828,143828,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"yes, it was a long time ago though. I used powerplant (old style macos class library from Metrowerks). The best thing was it had classes to deal with POP/SMTP.<p>What I learned:
 * don't write POP/SMTP/IMAP - it's been done
 * don't write for the home user, it's been done (IMHO)
 * the corporate world loves Exchange and Lotus Notes but they are not ideal solutions so you could look there. You will find it hard to get corporate customers to move from exchange/notes for company email though.
 * maybe look at customer support systems where emails are handled by many, many people. A lot of them have clever pre processing and flow control heuristics in them. You may have a new angle to help those guys.<p>The app I wrote was for fun because surely it can't be that hard. Well it was and I was a fool.<p>good luck.",1206362014

I don't feel _that_ disadvantaged because I have a mixed business/tech background, but in terms of applying to YC it's clear that being on your own is a major mark down.<p>It could be fairly interesting to see if a couple of technical people, working on different products, could act as one company. Both parties get the benefits of having someone to look over their shoulder (as they have a financial stake). You also get the sum of both sets of secondary skills and contacts. The downside would be a split in focus, but that should be no worse than the two working individually.",1206361549
144498,comment,144321,144487,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I would suggest we be careful with definitions here. Certainly  certain policies impact certain jobs. My grandfather was a farmer. That is, until the economy changed. Then he wasn't a farmer any more.The policy may have had negative impacts on farmers, but it could only have a very limited impact on my grandfather.<p>I would also distinguish between ""making somebody poor"" and ""poverty"", which is a state of existence. Likewise, I would also distinguish between internal poverty, ie, despair, and external poverty -- lack of money.<p>The definitions always get you on these things. For instance, most people are familiar with studies that show ""the rich get richer while the poor get poorer"" in some western societies like the United States. What readers fail to gleam from these studies is that while the numbers for the quintiles do show those movements, people move around between quintiles a lot more than is acknowledged. So when we say the poor get poorer, we are confusing the statistical average of a category of random people with actual, real people. Actual, real people move about in income levels quite a bit. The statistical bottom fifth of people in general, however, is not doing so well.<p>Likewise when we talk about poverty, or the economy, or social policy, we're dealing in large, averaged groups of things, not individual people. It makes a difference because we are individual, unique people, not statistical clumps.<p>I'm not saying that the internal attitudes of a person is enough to overcome any external obstacle. What I am saying is that the way we internalize external challenges is a better measure of anti-poverty and future happiness than the amount of money we have in the bank. Therefore, you cannot ""kill"" me, make me poor, by taking away my money. My internal wealth is outside of your ability to change.",1206361406

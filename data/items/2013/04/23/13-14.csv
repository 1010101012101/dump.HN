(Read about my prison sentence and my new project here: <a href=""http://comebackasap.com/burn_the_boats/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comebackasap.com/burn_the_boats/</a> )<p>Though I ""only"" served a year, the one thing I missed more than anything --including family, friends, and the touch of a woman-- was internet access. (I love my family, friends, and lady friends but a year away from them wasn't so bad. Fortunately I have no kids.)<p>I'd literally have dreams about the internet. One dream I remember in particular was winning an imaginary ""Inmate of the Month"" contest. My prize was an hour of unfettered access to the internet. It was absolute bliss checking my email, Google Voice, Hacker News, etc.)  I remember that dream with vivid clarity to this day. It may seem innocuous, but to me it illustrates how we've become so accustomed to an information-driven existence.<p>While in prison I'd seen numerous sports trivia arguments that resulted in all-out brawls that could've easily been resolved with a 5 second Google search. (Dudes were getting sent to the SHU for as many as 6 months because of a fight that stemmed from an argument over which team Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against. Insane.)<p>So you may ask, ""Why not ask the C.O.'s to look it up on their phones?"" It's true, some CO's would do it for us. Others would tell us flat-out ""no"". But then you have to worry about the d<i></i>k CO's that would pretend to look it up, then give us faulty information just to stoke the flames of discord amongst us inmates. (I've seen this happen multiple times.)<p>As you can imagine, there is a lot of storytelling (read: lying) that goes on in prison. Imagine not being able to call a guy out on his nonsense with a couple swipes of the screen. ""Oh you're in prison for moving 100 kilos of cocaine? Says here you were convicted for felony DUI.""  An extreme example but you get the point. In the free world, people simply can't get away with BS when each of us is walking around with miniature super-computers in our pockets.<p>""Cruel punishment"" indeed.",1366725537

This is simply wrong.<p>Second off, it harms developers and producers because people view software purchases as high risk. Ever wondered why people dwell on buying a $3 app, but can impulse buy a phone for $300? If the phone is broken, you go back to the buyer and get it replaced. If the phone is unusable in term of user-interface, you replace it with a different phone/model or return it to the shop (EU law enabled this option by law most of the time). In one sentence, the producer is responsible so the consumer view it as low risk. With software, if won't start, is buggy or simply won't fulfill the intended task, the consumer is to blame for doing a bad purchase. The consumer see this as high risk. Thus, risk aversion goes into affect. If you are in the business of software development, you do not want this.<p>Last, if the producers of software is never hold responsible for their product, that attitude creeps over to critical systems like medical instruments and airplane computers.

However, it's a platform that they do moderate- usually heavily. Reddit actually has quite a history of stopping witch hunts, ever since they started having problems with people posting user information, or inciting people to harass someone off-site. They've been quite successful at it, and the community is thankful.<p>However, those were always related to cases that didn't have any reason whatsoever to have large groups involved- they were to harass community members, some small-name celebrities, or people with opinions that are unpopular on Reddit. This was the first time that it was something that theoretically, Reddit <i>could</i> do some good with- and has had a bit of luck in doing this, albeit for much smaller crimes, in the past, by digging up license plate numbers, or giving advice that led to figuring a suspect out(usually stuff like hit and runs, or technology robberies).<p>Obviously, this taught them that there is no good time to let the Reddit hunt go. That it should <i>always</i> be moderated, every time, out of existence. You could say that they should've known that going in- but then again, CNN, The New York Post, Twitter, and HackerNews fucked this shit up as well. Everyone but the feds did.

3924107,comment,3923106,3923802,113,0,clavalle,,,"Crisis mode is addictive.<p>It was fun to play the hero and get 'That One Critical Feature' out of the door for an important demo.  It is a rush.  Investors like it.  Engineers like it.  Soon a company is always in crisis mode; pushing hard to get the next great thing out.  It becomes the culture.<p>At one company I worked at the VP of Engineering was the hardest, longest working person I'd ever met and a driver of that culture.  No matter how hard or long you worked, he could beat you at that metric without breaking a sweat.  There was a lot of pressure to live up to that example.  Mostly I didn't mind because solving problems on a deadline is fun.  Mostly.<p>Eventually, inevitably, that lifestyle started catching up to us.  Nerves were frayed. Small technical disagreements started to stretch on into weeks long religious cold wars.  We started losing good people who had the good sense to see what was happening.<p>Those of us who believed in the company and product stayed on, even thrived at some level.<p>After a few years of this something drastic changed.  Our VPoE mother died unexpectedly.  It hit him hard.  He realized that he had been ignoring absolutely everything but the business.  Everything.  And the culture shifted on a dime.  Engineers were no longer /allowed/ to be called on weekends whereas before we had to respond in 20 min.  He would make it a point to go out with us after the workday, or even during the workday, to chat about life, the direction of the company, whatever.  Most importantly, he ran interference when it came to the clients and laid down and enforced very sane timetables for completion of projects and features.  And if there was a delay, it was ok...not the end of the world.<p>The product did not languish.  Things still got done.  Turns out clients, for the most part, could not care less how hard and fast we worked.  Having good information for when something would be complete was sufficient.  Sometimes better because we were not breaking ourselves trying to impress them with impossible deadlines that we would sometimes miss.  Good information was better than fast information.<p>On top of that, the quality of the product improved.  Crises mode was used too often as an excuse for shipping half baked product.<p>Creativity blossomed.  Several revenue generating products were conceived and executed in the breathing space we all now had.<p>People started recommending talented friends to fill positions again...<p>Altogether, it was just a much better scene.<p>Now our criteria crisis is much more strict.  It is basically ""Will someone (client) die or lose their house if this is not done by some certain time?""  If the answer is no, go home.<p>If you are managing people and part of your evaluation criteria, formally or informally, is ""does that person work a lot of hours"" or if your 'business stability' requires that kind of sacrifice on any kind of regular basis you are doing it wrong.<p>TL:DR Unless a client is going to die or go bankrupt if you or your employees don't work extra hours, go home.",1336057089
3924106,comment,3923106,3923106,16,0,dkarl,,,"<i>In Austria, an entry level programmer with high level university training will usually get offered 2200 Euro gross. I'm not kidding.</i><p>I think employers should be cut a little slack with entry-level, straight-out-of-school programmers.  They regard them as having no proven value, which is fair, and in most cases they will have to sink a significant amount of time and effort into making them productive in a business environment.  The world is more than 19-year-old open source celebrities and wizard start-up coders.  There are a lot of regular people with CS degrees and no experience beyond school projects.  Entry-level positions exist for people like that.  (Even programmers with a history of open-source contributions are an unknown quantity when it comes to their ability to contribute to projects they didn't choose, that don't scratch their own itch, that don't come with public bragging rights, etc.)<p>Not providing an exceptional starting point for exceptional kids is forgivable, because exceptional contributors have their own contacts already that they are presumably working.  If you don't have contacts and are stuck looking at normal entry-level jobs, then forgive the corporate world for being a little skeptical.  If we want corporations to hire and train normal graduates (and we do, if we care about unemployment, and our future pool of skilled tech workers) then we should accept them being payed a fair guess at what they'll be worth in their first year of employment.  If you think you're worth more, then maybe you should forgive employers for not being psychic enough to take you at your word.  If you think you're worth more <i>and</i> you have better options, then why do you think entry-level positions are intended for you?  You have your path, and these jobs are for someone else.",1336057083

3924101,comment,3923106,3923798,6,0,phamilton,,,"Your salary, by its very nature must be less than ""value added"", and more than ""cost of living"".<p>Anything within that range fulfills the minimum requirements of both parties.<p>The incentive to negotiate is based upon proximity to those limits.  An engineer who barely makes enough to get by (like one making 90k with a family of 4 in the bay area) has greater incentive to negotiate than one making enough (65k in Boise, ID where a 3 bedroom house is 150k) in a less expensive area.<p>In more expensive areas, overhead increases.  $6k/month for a office in Palo Alto reduces ""value added"" for an employee significantly.  Electricity costs almost double in CA than in Idaho.  These and other factors affect the value added.  (This doesn't factor in so much when you work remotely).<p>I'm not going to get into supply and demand too much, but another big reason they pay less is because they can.  Because very few employees are irreplaceable.  Leaving a crappy 3 bedroom apartment in the bay area and moving to Idaho and buying a house in exchange for a 30% pay cut isn't a bad deal.",1336057044

3924097,comment,3923471,3923845,5,0,exDM69,,,"> I'm saying copyright the entire item, which to me means the syntax.<p>A programming language is so much more than just the syntax. The syntax is only skin-deep, what matters (and where the differences are) is the semantics of the language.<p>The problem in copyrighting the syntax of a language is that it's very trivial to whip up another syntax. For example, JavaScript has the regular syntax but you can also write JavaScript using the CoffeeScript or ParenScript syntax while having the same semantics.<p>So if someone were to copyright a language syntax, it would be very easy to write an almost compatible language with a minor change to the syntax. The new language would be (source level) incompatible, but in essence it would be the same thing. The only reason for adding this incompatibility would be to avoid IP restrictions.<p>That's what we don't want, similar but incompatible languages with the only motivation being keeping lawyers happy.",1336057002

3924092,comment,3922794,3922794,10,0,reasonattlm,,,"I recently wrote on the topic of the lack of overlap between zealotry for a cause and wealth. I think that to become super-wealthy requires a certain cluelessness when it comes to what to spend money on - or how to spend money to best effect, or more fundamentally how to use money to change the world in a way you believe in, or a lack of the vision needed to see how to spend money.<p>This is a social evolution sort of a thing: if you are a zealot and you <i>know</i> how to spend money to effect the change you want, then you aren't going to stay on the money-accumulation train for anywhere near as long. You'll spend it, and make some of that change happen.<p>You need something like this sort of effect to explain why there are any wealthy people at all. Any one of the Forbes 100 could cure a couple of diseases, get a fair way to demonstrating a cure for aging in mice ($1 billion price tag), develop the tech to irrigate the Sahara, etc, etc. But they largely do not, and remain within the process they have built for themselves. Where they do go all out for philanthropy, there is usually a startling lack of imagination - see the Gates Foundation, for example, which is doing nothing more than business as usual in big philanthropy, or the Ellison Medical Foundation which does nothing more than replicate the NIH.<p>Anyway. Knowing how to spend money ""right"" (meaning right for you, your vision, having a vision, etc) is not compatible with accumulating money, and only the outliers will fall into both camps.<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/02/one-wealthy-zealot-would-make-a-20-year-difference.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/02/one-wealthy-zealo...</a>",1336056928

With both you know they can be dangerous. (In the case of a gun you know even more so obviously.)

Apple likely lowered the price as an incentive to push users into its App store, where it gets a cut from every piece of software sold. Dividing the components and selling them individually probably brought in quite a few new users such as myself who didn't want to pay $80 for the full iWork package since it's only Keynote I'm interested in.<p>Services are more deeply and negatively affected by price changes than software, though. A price change that seems insignificant to you can drive many users away. Look at the fiasco with Netflix last year; they changed their prices by about $6 and subsequently lost about a million subscribers within a few months. Some users see price increases as an indication of a service's instability in the marketplace (and therefore a cue to jump-ship). Most users have lower tolerance thresholds for price differences when comparing services than they do when comparing one-time purchases (like software).<p>Regardless, now would be a really bad time for Dropbox to increase their pricing. Many Mac & iPhone users are watching iCloud closely and realizing that it could make Dropbox redundant for them. A price increase, even one as small as a ~$30 a year change for their 50+ plan (corollary to your $3 a month change), could push enough users away from the service that Dropbox is better off sticking to its guns.",1336055853

The success of things I have Open Sourced has been entirely dependent on additional effort I've put into documentation and fit-and-finish...  Sometimes these efforts are 2x the cost of developing something that was ""good enough for me""<p>I can't say it's a good thing,  but it's common for a company that develops commercial software to require several days to set up a build environment for a new developer.  If you've only got,  say,  5 developers,  the burden is tolerable and companies choose to live with this rather than take the effort to create a reproducable build system.  (And no,  a virtual machine doesn't count)<p>An Open Source project,  however,  really needs to be something that builds and works out of the box and that has complete documentation as to how to do it.<p>The level of fit-and-finish work to get there is similar, but different,  from the work required to make a successful commercial product.  Except there's no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow -- and as this article points out,  working for free is one of the best ways to experience burnout.<p>On top of that,  code you release is like a puppy.  Odds are you'll have users who want support long before you have any help in development.  You might find,  8 years after you release it,  that you got one of the coefficients wrong in a random number generator -- and then you feel a strong moral obligation to update the software even when it was written in an environment you haven't used for 5 years.<p>So you might think you like like a hero now for releasing some fresh code on github,  but later on you're the monster who dumped out a lot of garbage years ago.",1336054994

Have to tab to a different terminal to run the command? Not that big of a deal in the grander scheme of things.<p>If you need to build new software to shave a couple of seconds off of finding a piece of code, or switching to documentation, or running a command without pressing ALT-TAB, I would venture to say you have other problems not related to workflow or tools. Say, your ability to stay  concentrated and focused without interruptions, understanding that your development workflow does not a product team make, or focusing on the problem your product is trying to solve in the real world market versus getting into self-masturbatory work-flow science.<p>I don't disagree that component-based workflows are important, but I also can't count how many times I've seen developers more concerned with how they work than what they produce.",1336054954

""Way of living"" sounds too easy and fuzzy! But Zen does incorporate elements of all those things.<p>Zen is a tradition that is firmly based on the practice of meditation (zazen) as a way to gain insight into fundamental aspects of awareness and let go of clinging to concepts and self. This sounds very abstract, which is why Zen teachers sometimes prefer to express themselves very concretely, like in this story:<p>A monk told Joshu: `I have just entered the monastery. Please teach me.'<p>Joshu asked: `Have you eaten your rice porridge?'<p>The monk replied: `I have eaten.'<p>Joshu said: `Then you had better wash your bowl.'<p>It's hard to talk about all of Zen at once --- though I guess any one word is sufficient, even silence says everything, or just snapping one's fingers --- so I think it's better to just look at basic zazen instructions and start practicing, because nothing makes sense until you taste that.<p>If you look at the formal aspects of Zen practice --- the rigorous monastery schedules, etc --- it can seem like a very stiff and rigid religion. And in one sense it is. But from the inside, this strictness is just a helpful way of intensifying.<p>Feel free to ask if there's anything you're curious about, I might be able to answer, though I'm really a beginner.",1336054931

An entire CS course can be conducted using Knuth's TAOCP, paper and pens only. The reason being that Computer Science is a highly specialised extension of Applied Mathematics into computing environments. These courses produce researchers. Programming, software development and project management are out-of-scope.<p>Software Engineering courses are meant to cover the real world application of the Computer Science discipline, Project Management discipline and a broad variety of other topics relating to business and management. These courses produce software developers and software project managers that mostly sit in modern interpretations of the cubicle farm developing the 150th interpretation of a business productivity app.<p><i>Experience levels</i><p>3-5 years at University is not enough time to gain expertise in the wide range of areas that make someone a brilliant hacker. The best hackers graduating from University tend to have 10 or more solid years of diverse and highly creative experience through hobby involvement (open source development), school experiences and perhaps relevant paid work.<p>Work experience tends to lack the diversity and creativity required to develop and maintain impressive hacking skills. Changing jobs every 2 years or maintaining a strong open source/hobby interest can counteract this problem.<p><i>Suggestions for higher education courses</i><p>1. Treat Computer Science in the purest form -- an extended Applied Mathematics course.<p>2. Encourage students to complete a Computer Science and Software Engineering course together. This approach ensures that students graduate with a decent understanding of essential theory: graphs, sets, complexity, algebra, etc and have a job prospect at the end.<p>3. Replace toy problems and short assignments in Software Engineering courses with longer real world experiences. Open source projects, student-owned start-ups and short stints of relevant paid work experience are a much better environment for applying theory and practising software project management principles.<p>4. Make it clear to students that learning should be a life-long goal. Diversity of experiences across completely different fields (example: marine biology, tourism and software development) is of particular importance.",1336054120

That also means that you cannot put any new features in, because you would just make the game unplayable. And since the engine is flawed in itself, there is no way to optimize away the slowness.<p>I don't agree with the author at all. Its much better to have an open source engine. You can customize it to your own needs by stripping out parts you don't need. Thus get performance by dropping features you don't need at all, and thus saving development time by not having to optimize parts you do need, but which take more time than they would be worth.<p>If you don't care about tailoring the engine to the game you are writing, then the engine will show its restrictions on the game.

Top companies who are selecting the cream of the crop can afford to pay this because they know how to get great talent and make the most of it.<p>If startups are paying $100k+ to people straight out of school (mine certainly isn't) then it's an unfortunate symptom of easy money and does not bode well on the fiscal responsibility of founders which is key to early-stage success.  Bubble or not, money will not stay this easy indefinitely and that will have a direct impact on low-end salaries.<p>Finally, European benefits are not to be underestimated when put up against US salaries.  2-3x vacation, free healthcare, inability to be fired, cheaper education, etc, etc.",1336053804

This is not unique to IT. You have to start by paying people a FAIR wage to cover their living expenses, and it goes up from there based on skills and experience.<p>If you flatly reject a job that doesn't pay you based on some mythical calculation of ""value added"" whatever that means, you'll be unemployed a long long time.

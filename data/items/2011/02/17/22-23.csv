That their hand was in the cookie jar is a fact of public record.<p>While many decry the settlement itself, it's also important to look to history for the circumstances of the agreement: it was hashed out in the weeks following the 9-11 attacks.

2233239,comment,2223705,2224887,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Your ""ten years ahead of the market"" is not very well defined or meaningful.  If a business idea is poor, then there have to be better objections than that.  If that's the only objection, then it is not very serious.<p>There can be many reasons a business can fail; being ""ten years ahead of the market"" is not a meaningful description of any of them.<p>Again, for an extreme scenario, if you see how to make a pill so that that one pill taken once will safely cure any cancer, then you will have a very successful business.  And, with irony, at this point one might guess that the pill was ""50 years ahead"" of the state of the art, the rest of medical science, or something or other, maybe your ""market"", and all that will matter not at all.  Instead you will literally have to hire guards to keep the desperate customers from knocking down your door.<p>""Ahead of the market"" is just next to irrelevant.<p>The challenge in the one pill is just understanding how to make it.  That challenge is similar for many products that would obviously be very valuable to have.  The reason we don't have the products is that no one has the understanding to know how to make the product.  As soon as someone does understand how to make the product, then they will have a successful business and 'behind, equal, or ahead of the market' will be irrelevant.<p>For your first paragraph, I addressed essentially exactly your content in my:<p>""3.)  Totally unique ideas generally don't make it<p>Nonsense.  What he means is, say, a new product, of a very different kind in all respects, e.g., one that requires customers to do something quite new, for a new need for new customers in a new market generally doesn't make it.  Right.<p>But a one pill cure for cancer, which would be 'totally unique', would have to fight customers off with rings of guards, literally.""<p>That a product is ""totally unique"" is not by itself a handicap.  Business history is awash in very successful products that were ""totally unique"".  Home lighting?  People used candles made from 'tallow', that is, fat.  Next came burning whale oil, then gas lights burning a crude natural gas made from coal, then kerosene made from newly discovered crude oil, then incandescent electric lights, then fluorescent electric lights, and now light emitting diodes.  From the first candle to the present, that each advance was ""totally unique"" was not a handicap.  Instead, each advance was better and, thus, warmly welcomed.<p>Electric power for a house?  Suppose in 1900 you had a really nice house but without electric power.  Now what?  It will be a PAIN to run the wires.  If the wires are all behind the walls, then there is a lot of carpentry to do.  If the wires are, say, in tubes or some such but visible, then you have just made a mess out of possibly some gorgeous construction.  Home electric power was ""totally unique"", but people eagerly did it.<p>In 1950, people who traveled across the Atlantic used steamships.  By 1970, there were nearly no such steamships.  Why?  Boeing made the 707 that was fast, smooth, and quiet and got people across in a few hours instead of a few days.  The 707 was ""totally unique"" and accepted right away.  So was the Concorde, for those who could pay for it.<p>The first telegraphs?  Definitely ""totally unique"", and was a rapidly growing business right away.<p>TV?  Definitely ""totally unique"", and soon nearly everyone had to have one, and moderately wealthy people had several.  Early on the programming was suckage; the electronics was unreliable; and the signal quality was awful; still people bought them.<p>A large fraction of all the materials now used in small commercial building construction was not even on the market 30 years ago.  But each time a good, new ""totally unique"" product came out, it made good progress.  So, want some long floor joists?  Want to look for a 20 foot long 2 x 12?  F'get about.  Instead you will likely have to use a fake wooden I-beam where the interior is plywood and the top and bottom are glued from thin strips of wood.  For exterior sheathing?  Used to use diagonal 1 x 6 or some such.  Then used plywood.  Now use 'oriented strand particle board' glued up from wood scraps.<p>Insulation?  Now commonly polyurethane foam installed with a special spray gun when the outer sheathing is on but the inner walls are not.  ""Totally unique"" product.<p>A microwave oven?  ""Totally unique"" and caught on right away.<p>FedEx overnight small package delivery?  When it came out, it was ""totally unique"" but caught on quickly.<p>The US does a census each 10 years.  By about 1880 or so, it was taking longer than 10 years to process the census data.  So the Census Bureau worked with Herman Hollerith who, roughly, borrowed from Jacquard's special loom (""totally unique"") and made his ""totally unique"" punched card equipment; it was used in the next census and was much faster.  That the solution was ""totally unique"" didn't bother the 19th century census people at all.<p>During WWII, the main means of numerical calculations was just mechanical calculators.  Looking for something better, von Neumann and others built some ""totally unique"" electronic digital computers.  Caught on right away.<p>Daisy wheel printers?  ""Totally unique"" and caught on right away.  I still have one connected to a serial port at 1200 bps with XON/XOFF and use it for typing addresses on envelopes.<p>The dot matrix printer, the laser printer, the ink jet printer?  ""Totally unique"" and caught on right away.<p>In the late 1940s, Bell Labs finally was successful on what they had wanted before WWII -- a solid state electronic amplifier to replace hot, unreliable vacuum tubes.

We've already seen circuits implanted on contact lenses. We're already seeing augmented reality on phones becoming normal.<p>Now, imagine glasses that project displays Layar style several feet in front of you. Imagine contact lenses that do this, or that change shape depending on where you're looking and how you're focusing.<p>We already have prototypes of these things, or are part-way along the way to achieving them within the next 5-20 years.<p>Now imagine map systems that talk to a wristwatch that 'pulls' north or towards your route so you don't need to use a screen to orient your surroundings. Imagine walking into a room and closing the curtains with a gesture. Turn the volume up and down like a conductor.<p>Those last ones are possible with current technology, they just need to find their way into commercial products.<p>So you're meeting a friend at a cafe and you're running late. They can see a pointer to where you are, and their contact lenses are automatically notified of where you are 5 minutes before you're meant to meet them (through notifo 8.0, natch). It's ok though because your coffee order was put through and they know not to begin to fulfil your order until you get within 100m of the cafÃ©. Your friend gets notified of the great Vancouver coffee riot (due to crop failures there's no coffee in Vancouver, the withdrawal was a powder keg waiting to explode) as they followed the hashtag, articles from the New York Post mingle with tweets in a semi-transparent newspaper style display about 3 feet from them, but your friend likes old fashioned themes. They get pinged automatically once you're about to come around the corner (thanks to a YC funded Google Maps/Notifo mashup) just in time for your coffee.<p>We have the tech for almost all of that already, the main issues are bandwidth, integration and battery power, and the lenses.<p>Now Imagine a wrist-based device that monitors your heart beat by collecting data from sensors on your chest, can work out your blood sugar level from the flow of magnetically charged sugar-bound nano particles and that can administer insulin through a peripheral catheter.<p>Bizarrely, we have the sensors, we have the potential to create the nanoparticles within the next 5-20 years, the only issue is the administration (currently it would be a catheter or subcutaneous administration for some, but alternatives are in the works). With that technology we could use it to administer all kinds of stuff.<p>Now imagine all of that combined with the ability to interact with people both near you and on the other side of the world with no difference, save some lag.<p>You could be sat there in the US, having your meds and numbers monitored remotely from Manilla by trained staff, and your meds will administer once it notices a significant adverse change. You could then blink, then look towards the menu item you want to bring up and see your granddaughter's school recital in Paris streamed over the Internet and watch it as though you're there (or rather you could if Flash wasn't such a hog and your glasses kept stuttering, maybe time for an upgrade to iGlasses 2?) and not miss the 49ers game.<p>That's where I think we're headed. I think that will be the biggest thing in tech until we're replacing organs cloned from the patient's own cells and can grow blood in a machine.<p>Anyway, that's just my 2p worth (perhaps 20p then!). what does everyone else think, am I nuts?",1297982092

2233121,comment,2231621,2231621,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"The author is correct that, as a language ""in the small"", Scala offers many more ways for a programmer to create hard-to-understand complexity.  Though many things have been conceptually simplified (the distinction between primitives and objects has been abstracted away so that most developers don't have to worry about, for example) there is a whole lot more stuff that make it easy to hang yourself with.  (See implicit conversions and parameters, destructuring and pattern matching, and the power of the type system).  Most of these things can be used to make code more readable, concise, and flexible, but can also be used to great ill effect.<p>When it comes to programming ""in the large"", like the author seems to be describing, I couldn't disagree more.  Here it's Java--the culture and ecosystem--that tends towards over-abstraction, huge frameworks that obscure rather than illuminate intent, ridiculous class names that include ""FactoryFactory"", and so on.<p>I would argue that the second phenomenon--the hugely complex frameworks that have arisen in the Java world--is a direct consequence of the lack of power offered by Java, the language.  Complex frameworks that do dependency injection through bytecode generation and XML configuration files really aren't necessary in the Scala world, where 90% of what you're actually trying to do can be done using compile-time mixins.  The factory pattern can be replaced with anonymous first-class functions, with a net increase in clarity and conciseness.  Most things that makes Scala more complicated in the small can be also be used to replace even more complicated, ad-hoc patterns and frameworks that make big Java projects such a pain to work on.<p>That said, it could be true that introducing Scala into existing codebases that already have thousands of lines of Spring XML config might simply introduce additional complexity, without offering a realistic path to removing all of the nonsense that supports the legacy Java code.",1297980845

Machine learning of Watson's nature (classification problems, feature selection, etc.) is able to take data generated from the world and find interesting patterns to make a prediction. This is nowhere near the creation of new ideas, like Galois' insights into field theory or the work Perelman contributed toward the concept of a Ricci flow. I haven't yet heard how to create a machine whose thoughts ""can wander"" in a way that isn't hopelessly inefficient. That would be a big leap toward this type of AI.",1297980563

An unemployed person whether skilled or unskilled is still unemployed and doesn't really have grounds for saying a test is beneath them.<p>If we can filter out a large percentage of the unskilled with a litmus test like Fizzbuzz that should be a big win. Bigger, in fact, because we've stipulated that the unskilled are far more common than the skilled in today's labor market.

581,comment,574,574,0,0,simon,,,"This is a great book. All of the advice in t is either excellent or at least thought-provoking. Highly recommended.<p>Now, that being said, I did order a dead tree version through the Lulu.com store (very nice store, by the way) and while I love the construction and print quality of the book, the internal page layout and typography were awful. And the choice of a glossy black cover shows annoying fingerprints after just a few minutes.<p>I'm glad that I've read this book because it has given me motivation to start something. I'm trying out a couple of ideas right now to see which one I like and will run with.<p>So, thanks to the guys at 37Signals, but have someone who knows what they're doing, help you with layout next time!",1172191752
580,comment,510,510,0,0,jbruin,,,"With Craiglist (San Diego) I've managed to find two apartments, two jobs, and a plethora of unnecessary information that titillates my mind. All I got from eBay was a Lord of the Rings replica sword for my boyfriend, and I had to pay for it. Hands down, Craiglist rocks...although my girlfriend would agrue in favor of eBay as she is an aficionado of coach handbags and can find them for cheap.",1172191310

I'm tired of everyone calling their website web2.0-ready although most of the time it looks like they don't have a clue what they are talking about. It could be me though.",1172190243
578,comment,510,510,0,0,keesj,,,"I don't know about the US, but in my country (The Netherlands) nobody has ever heard of Craigslist but a lot of people DO know eBay. I'm pretty sure this is in the same in many other countries and perhaps in the US too.<p>Sure, Craigslist may earn more with their fees.. but eBay can (easily) change their system to reflect Craigslist's.
Also, eBay could change their fees to reflect Craigslist's if they want.",1172190050

575,comment,257,364,0,0,leoc,,,"I can't find the reference now, but I *think* I've just read something suggesting that the install process for an Apollo applet will involve an &#34;install-this-application?&#34; confirmation dialog followed by a download of 30 seconds or so. If so then Apollo's less promising than I hoped. That kind of install may be low-friction by desktop-app standards but it doesn't compare to the ease of starting a browser-based AJAX or Flash application. (Consider how easy it is to use maps.google.com for the first time.)<p>Surely it will at least be that Apollo applications will run untrusted by default, and that an already-installed app will start automatically whenever you take your browser to the URL you downloaded it from?",1172189389

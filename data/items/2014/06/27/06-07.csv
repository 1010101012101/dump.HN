7952976,comment,7950102,7950102,1,0,stagas,,,"I stopped reading at the tilde argument for readability. I find the tilde token far more readable and easier to spot, and there&#x27;s no confusion as to what the indexOf is checking for, the existence of an element in an array, where with the equality comparison tokens I need to stop and read what the heck it is comparing to. These should be reserved for when it&#x27;s checking for a specific index or range.<p>Those extra seconds add up and in my opinion readability is more about optimizing reading speed by using common shapes and patterns conventionally, not making something dumb proof.<p>It even suggests using a dependency like underscore for something that is already in the language. So if I don&#x27;t use underscore, I need to stop my reading completely because my mind doesn&#x27;t recognize this _(array).contains(&#x27;foo&#x27;) pattern and I need to actively read the entire line and in cases lookup the documentation of some random method in a random obscure _ library that I also need to lookup in the code to find the actual dependency name. Because even if I were to check the implementation of that underscore method using the IDE, it&#x27;s even more obscure and magic. Good luck following the advice in this book.",1403851707

A highway with an official speed limit of 110km/h can be perfectly safe to drive at 130km/h in one stretch but dangerous to drive at 90km/h in another stretch just a few km away.

The remarkable thing about building software quickly is that if you focus on speed, cutting quality where needed to &quot;move forward&quot;, you end up slowing down after a while, due to the build-up of technical debt. A continued focus on speed will typically result in slower development, and a low-quality product, a sort of worst of both worlds scenario.<p>We&#x27;re a typical &quot;launch in 3 months!&quot; start-up that is now 7 years old, and we&#x27;ve were so focused on growth and feature development to meet the market that technical debt just accumulated and accumulated.<p>Eventually, technical debt began to have a real impact on business feature delivery, so we talked about it with our business team and came to an agreement that 30% of development time was ours to reduce this major risk.<p>The end result is that over time, as quality improved, our  business feature delivery has gotten better and faster - less bugs, and more features per sprint.

Now you have a victim with a permanent smear against her created by an easily accessible record of fact (the newspaper, not the court record).

7952898,comment,7951803,7952272,2,0,anaptdemise,,,"So just to start, I hope you watch the SyFy series Continuum[1]. The basic synopsis is that in the future, governments and economies collapse and the &quot;Corporations&quot; bail everyone out. I  mean, you trust your personal information to FB way faster than you do with the GVT.<p>Anyways...<p>So, my very limited understanding of civil/city/state governments is that they are already special forms of &quot;Non-Profit Corporate Entities&quot; in most states, &quot;Municipal Corporations&quot;[2]. All other &quot;private law enforcement entities&quot; derive from some variation/bastardization of these laws depending on the state. So yes, most private citizens/corporations, what ever definition of the term[3], can obtain any of the weapons described in the article, with limits/exceptions. For instance, the SWAT team of Dallas, TX is part of the Dallas Police Department (Dallas being a Municipal Corporation). I chose this as an example because, when you google Dallas SWAT, you either get a reality TV show or a Facebook Page. In most smaller counties, it is part of the county Sherifs Department. In most states, the only person that can arrest a Sherif is the Governor or Agent of The Federal Government. Stay with me. This is all an argument of semantics from the beginning.<p>US entities operating outside the US borders obtain literally what ever equipment they, or their clients, can afford. Further, they are either bound by US Military rules of conduct (rules of engagement), beholden to local law, or either/neither seemingly as the parties see fit [see current US military advisor rules in Iraq vs. Blackwater authorization in Op. Iraqi Freedom].<p>My reading of this article is the scenario last referenced on US soil. A claim that a local SWAT team is both and neither. The power of a government law enforcement agency with the &quot;loosely defined rights&quot; of a private corporation (individual.) It is &quot;risk management&quot; in the corporate sense. You structure yourself for greatest legal/financial protection/benefit.<p>Grey area -- rant. Expand this to the Federal Government... The FBI is the only organization that is authorized to investigate wrong doing within itself[4]. In addition, the federal government can chose whether or not you are aloud to sue them in federal court (all courts by proxy.)[5]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Elec...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/us/in-150-shootings-the-fbi-deemed-agents-faultless.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/us/in-150-shootings-the-fb...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity_in_the_Unite...</a>",1403849196

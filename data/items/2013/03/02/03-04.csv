The Mac Pro is basically indistinguishable from a bulky 90s tower PC, and very few people actually need it.<p>It's a decidedly unsexy product.

Apple has made its reputation in the 90s with the film/graphics/illustration market, and that's where the Power Mac/Mac Pro was a critical product. Once the switch to Intel was made and laptops started catching up in speed/GPU power, less people needed a fixed tower just for Photoshop/After Effects/Maya, they just put those apps on a laptop. Moreover, the professional market is always smaller than the consumer market, and consumers don't want desktops, so Apple just went where the money is.<p>They got rid of Xserve and they'll likely get rid of the Mac Pro if demand falls significantly.",1362196222

5308376,comment,5307752,5307752,2,0,kps,,,"If you have failed to grok vi[m], you need two things. First, to understand just a little of two other editors, ed and TECO. Second, to know that vi's <i>real</i> modes are not what the nave user, and sadly most documentation, call modes; they are line mode (ed mode) and visual mode (TECO mode).<p>ed is a line editor based on search-and-replace using regular expressions. To edit existing text, you typically locate it with a search and change it with a replace. Sometimes you refer to nearby lines with .n addressing, and sometimes by absolute line number (having printed a few lines with the n command); and sometimes you change entire lines (with c') rather than doing a replacement; but really, search-and-replace is where it's at. vi's line mode, which you enter with Q or more commonly one-off with :', is just ed on steroids.<p>TECO is a character stream oriented editor, or, if you prefer, a programming language for manipulating streams of text. <a href=""http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2010/11/30/the-glorious-horror-of-teco/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2010/11/30/the-glorious...</a> is a decent short introduction. TECO text manipulation functions have an optional count, a function name (one or two characters), and an optional argument terminated by ESC. That should already look familiar; vi's visual mode is watered-down TECO. Sure, many of the functions have different names  vim's h and l are TECO's r and c  but some are the same: i followed by an argument (i.e. some text) terminated by ESC is the function that inserts its argument before the current editing point. It's counterproductive to think of vi as having an insert mode and append mode and replace mode and substitute mode and whatnot, just as it would be conterproductive to think of the <i>x</i> in <i>sin(x) + cos(x)</i> as being in sine mode or cosine mode.<p>Spend an hour with ed and an hour with TECO, and you'll begin to grok vi.",1362196073
5308375,comment,5305055,5308097,1,0,robomartin,,,"Of course, I do understand what you are saying.  Now, also consider that your experience might not be common.<p>I am no stranger to 16 hour coding marathons.  In fact, about 15 years ago I launched a company out of my garage.  For the first nine months or so I nearly locked myself in the garage for 16 to 18 hours a day coding.  The work required a combination of Verilog for the FPGA, C for the embedded processor and Visual C++ for Windows.  Three different editor/IDE's: Xilinx ISE, Keil uVision and MS Visual Studio.  Over the nearly nine months of intense 12+ hours of straight solid coding in that environment I could not give you one example of situation where having to reach for the ""END"" key, the mouse, the arrow keys or ""Ctrl-F5"" or whatever bothered me in any way imaginable.  The IDE's and the text editors, for the most part, were relegated to background noise.<p>The things that slowed me down, caused grief and broke my short or long term concentration and my ability to maintain state have never, in my thirty years of programming, had anything whatsoever to do with the editor and the keystrokes I might have to use running it.<p>Anecdotally I will make a blanket statement and say that this is exactly the case for the vast majority of programmers.  No, I don't have data other than to say that I have worked with lots of people over my career.  Across platforms, languages, tool chains and editors I have never heard anyone complain about loosing state or concentration due to the editor.  Until I started reading HN.<p>Is there a type of personality, a type of programmer that can loose state from something as insignificant to some of us as reaching for the mouse or the arrow keys constantly?  Maybe, I don't know.  I have yet to meet someone like that in person.  If the answer is ""yes"", I'll have to simply take your word for it.  I don't know.<p>It might be also important to consider for a moment that those who have NOT forced themselves to use vi/vim are perfectly comfortable with the keystrokes and commands typical modern editors use.<p>If you stick to Windows and even Linux GUI the vast majority of the navigational commands are the same that you might find in MS Word, Excel, Outlook and your web browser.  The ""Ctrl-C"", ""Ctrl-V"", ""Ctrl-X"", ""Shift-[down arrow]"", ""Shift-[end]"", ""[home]"", ""[end]"", ""Ctrl-[left arrow]"", ""Ctrl-F"", ""Ctrl-H"", ""Ctrl-S"", ""F3"", ""Shift-F3"", mouse scrolling modes and other commands are part and parcel of this ""muscle memory"" a lot of vim proponents mention.<p>In other words, nobody thinks ""oh crap, I have to reach for Ctrl-F again"", it just happens.  And, it happens with great uniformity across platforms, applications and tools.  Various tools introduce a few (or a lot) of specialize commands, like ""Ctrl-F5"" for ""compile and go"" on an IDE, ""Ctrl-B"" to ""build"" or ""F12"" to launch your site on a browser on something like Dreamweaver.  These are not and have not been problems for anyone with whom I have ever worked.<p>Here's what I find interesting.  I was using real terminals and 300 to 9600 BAUD teletypes over real leased lines talking to mainframes towards the very tail of that era in the 80's.  I even had a little bit of experience using Tektronix storage tube terminals (one of the few ways you could render APL characters at the time).  All of these had crippled keyboards with half the keys we have today.  Editors at the time were weird and had shit user interfaced due to the limitations of the hardware.  Every single one was different.  Either you had modal editors or editors with weird Ctrl-<something>-<something> keystrokes.  When CPM and S100 computers came along you could get WordStar and eight inch floppies.  Ctrl-K-X brother!  I even owned a real DEC VT-100 terminal.<p>I think I can safely say that those of us who came up that route were GLAD to get rid of these shitty UI's and crappy contorted-command editors that were a pain in the ass to use and learn.  As keyboards and peripherals evolved and we got things like ""standard"" keyboard with expanded key sets (Thanks, mostly to IBM and the PC revolution) things began to standardize around the newly available keyboards.  No programmer in their right mind would write a text editor at the time and IGNORE all those extra keys.  The only way you could even consider writing something like vi is if you didn't have any option but to write vi due to hardware limitations.<p>And so, what I find very interesting is that here we are, so many years later with better hardware, software, multi-monitor GUI's and computers with gigabytes of memory and direct DVI connections to the monitors and we have a class of programmers that insists that --to be effective and to be considered a professional programmer-- you have to use a tool who's only reason for being designed as it was thirty years ago is that the writer had a keyboard with half the keys, over a 300 BAUD modem, a crippled terminal, limited memory, no graphics, 80 x 25 characters and no screen buffers.  Please understand how someone like me could see this as being nothing less than ridiculous.  Even vi's author relates the story of having gone down the path of adding windows to vi but loosing the code in a crash and never going back to re-creating it (the implication being that vi was already on a path to become a totally different product).<p>Anyhow, at some level, of course, to each his/her own.  My problem is with vim zealots who in places like HN tend to give newbies the idea that there are magical qualities attached to adopting the ""cult of vim"". From my perspective nothing could be farther from the truth.  And, as I have stated, from a business perspective, there are far more important and significant levers and knobs in a business to focus on than which editor you are using.",1362196034

There are no bonuses for performance on any of them, and its quite difficult to get fired lack of sales. The metrics they use are (in rough order of decreasing importance):\nNet Promoter Score\n~25ish% of people who purchase a 'hero product' (iPhone, Mac, iPod, or iPad) get an email asking them to rate their experience. One of the questions asks how likely you are to recommend apple based on your experience on a scale of 1 to 10. People who give a 9 or a 10 are considered promoters, and those who give below a 7 are detractors. Your net promoter score is % of people who give a 9 or 10 minus % percent below 7. The 5th avenue store's average score was around a 52.<p>This matters a lot, consistent negative reviews are one of the few things that can get you fired.<p>- AppleCare %- This is the extended warranty apple offers. This is emphasized pretty hard, managers frequently cite studies that show higher satisfaction for people who buy warranties etc. The official target for this is 50%, but getting over 20% puts you in the top tier, and anything below 10% gets you negative attention. Store average was around 13-17%. Its pretty rare you actually changes someone's mind on buying it, most people come in decided.<p>- 1 to 1 % - this is % of computers you sell with one to one, which is a year of as-many-as-you-want hour longs training sessions on basic computer stuff. A 6% 1 to 1 rate was outstanding and over 10% was unheard of, but official corporate expectation was 25%<p>- Sales $<p>- personal setup % - how many people you can get to sit with an apple employee and be walked through setup of iDevice.<p>While I was at Apple, they were pretty good about just letting you do whatever you felt was best for the customer. There's was never any pressure to force a sale, and you were encouraged to talk to customers for as long as they wanted.<p>source: I worked at 5th ave, Apple's busiest US retail store for 6 months in 2011-2012.

Desperately need your help.<p>Full disclosure: My name is Feldo and I am new to this site. A friend recommended I post here. Apologies if this is not allowed.<p>My business is on the verge of death, literally. We are a local Bay Area food startup that caters to startups, specifically Asian Fusion & Satays. Most of our business has been through two catering agencies but due to a mistake that was all my fault, we were recently dropped from 1 yesterday, which was the majority of our business. We were already negative before this. We can't survive much longer like this and being completely honest, this is dragging me near to tears. I've worked hard for years trying to get to where we are and pivoted this food business at least twice already in 3 years. We are only 3 guys.<p>Admittedly all of this is entirely my fault as I haven't tried as hard as I could in the past to do more guerrilla marketing, becoming complacent with our stream of clients through the agencies.<p>I am trying to correct course as soon as possible now and fix all of this. I've made many mistakes along the way and I own up to that. But at this point, I might not even have a business if we don't do something fast.<p>Our website: http://www.sataysfied.com/<p>Our Yelp page: http://www.yelp.com/biz/sataysfied-catering-san-mateo<p>Most of the customers that have tried us, loves our food. All of our past business were through these 2 catering agencies. Moving forward, I will try to build direct clientele with startups more and hustle, starting immediately.<p>I'm not asking for a hand out but I am pretty much begging, if you are in the Bay Area, and have a startup, work for one, or know people, I ask that you give us a chance to cater to you and/or help spread the word. We can use all the business we can get. We cater to startups of all sizes. If you have any feedback or anything, please leave a note.<p>All the best,<p>Feldo",1362193628

And it was not an isolated incident.  Therefore X fails to prevent Y.  In addition, X has lots of deleterious effects, not least of which is stifling competition.<p>> this article does a poor job of highlighting why the law is better dead than alive or modified<p>That's why this article is part of a (long, and not yet completed) series.<p>> Payment processors would be expected to fail from time to time<p>This is only true because the underlying infrastructure is antiquated and broken.  With a modern payment processing system based on a secure protocol there is no reason a payment processor should ever fail (other than fraud, but that is already a crime under <i>federal</i> law).",1362193627

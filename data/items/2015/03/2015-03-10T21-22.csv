2) Gratitude -- try to spend time every day thinking about the things you are grateful for
3) Meditation -- 10 minutes/day. It works. Studies prove it!
4) Relationship with the sun -- try to get outside at noon every day
5) Eat an anti inflammatory diet. Inflammation is heavily correlated with depression.
6) Try to do something nice for at least one person every day.
7) Research sleep quality and follow all the best practices.

Perspective.<p>Now consider the CEO of your company. He probably makes tens of millions a year. But do you think his first gig at a corporation was a starting salary with seven figures?

Time.<p>Now, i&#x27;m not saying you should just suck it up and deal with your lot in life. What I am saying is that the depression you feel now is a by-product of your perspective being locked at looking at your situation as a disadvantage, and the lack of vision of a better future. It&#x27;s possible to reorient the way you look at your situation to be happier with where you are, and be happy about how much better it can get with time.<p>Part of this improved mental state requires introspection, mindful awareness, and emotional growth. You can read various books or take workshops to help with this. It&#x27;s also useful to find outlets for your restless mind and body, such as exercise, art, music, reading, etc. There&#x27;s also growth to be had by being active with your family members [though I don&#x27;t have any useful examples as i&#x27;m single].<p>Finally, therapy works, and I highly recommend talking to someone, both about your job and personal life.

9180887,comment,9178783,9179395,0,0,zrm,,,"> DNSSEC is a terrible, terrible idea.<p>DNSSEC is a terrible, terrible <i>implementation</i>. All of your criticisms are valid but none of them are inherent to the idea of authenticating DNS resolution.<p>That basically means we need to start over from scratch, which is unfortunate, but now tell me if we did we couldn&#x27;t address your complaints:<p>1) It isn&#x27;t necessary. Sure, we can work around the lack of DNS authentication, but then we end up with the horrible CA system. Can we really not do any better than that?<p>2) It&#x27;s centralized and government-controlled. So don&#x27;t sign the root. Instead of hard-coding the root key in the resolvers, hard-code the keys for each TLD. Being able to pick which government can forge your signatures is the best you&#x27;re going to be able to do; the authority doing the signing is going to exist in somebody&#x27;s jurisdiction.<p>3) DNSSEC&#x27;s cryptography is weak. So use different cryptography. Elliptic curve keys and signatures are an order of magnitude smaller than RSA anyway, which also reduces the DNS DoS amplification potential by that amount.<p>4) Resolver APIs don&#x27;t provide good information about why resolution failed. So provide a new API that provides better errors. Put it right in the new RFC. Then you only get validation if you use the new API and nothing changes for existing applications.<p>5) Deployment is expensive. Why isn&#x27;t deployment automatic? The default configuration for a DNS server should be to generate a signing key for each domain on first run and then automatically sign all the records with it. If you&#x27;re paranoid and you want to keep your signing keys offline then you can configure that manually, but nobody has to. And the higher level domain should be able to get the signing key from the lower level domain as soon as you add the NS record, and then confirm with the administrator that it&#x27;s the right key the same way as with ssh host keys.<p>6) DNSSEC isn&#x27;t validated by the endpoints. As far as I can tell there is no actual reason for this even with existing DNSSEC. The client can ask its DNS cache for each of the signing keys up to the root and then check the signatures. A new pseudo-RR that would return the entire chain would make this more convenient, and couldn&#x27;t really be used for DoS because only recursive resolvers and not authoritative servers would answer that query. Validating clients without validating caches could still fall back to asking for each individual record.<p>7) Authoritative denials leak information. NSEC5 is supposed to fix this, but there is a much easier way: Sign a denial key which can itself only be used to sign denials and keep it on the authoritative server. The idea that someone who compromises your authoritative servers will be able to deny service to your DNS clients is already sort of implied.<p>The problem is, even though you could theoretically do all of those things to DNSSEC itself, those aren&#x27;t even the only problems, and trying to patch all the warts in something nobody is even really using is only going to make something which is already unnecessarily complicated even worse. What is needed very much is a clean slate.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth doing.",1426023960

1) A way of evaluating candidates that avoids mirrortocracy style institutional -isms like sexism and ageism. 
2) A way of convincing people who have bounced off the field due to -isms to even try.<p>BTW, Tom was great at Matasano on #1, and only moderately successful at #2. We get <i>tons</i> of people who aren&#x27;t in the industry, but they tend to self-select to be young men. For an individual company, #2 is way harder.

It started out looking more like Go. The JVM got this way because it is so heavily used for so many things. To paraphrase jwz, the JVM is big because your needs are big.<p>Go doesn&#x27;t seem to have dramatically different goals to Java. They&#x27;re both GCd languages with a standard library, memory safe code etc. The logical conclusion is that if Go became as widely used for as long as Java, it&#x27;d end up looking quite similar.

They let you join different queries together, built by different parts of the system, in a safe way. They let you work with the <i>native language you&#x27;re working in</i> instead of having to construct clauses in a foreign language, using strings. They let you post optimise your loading strategies.<p>You might want &quot;exactly like that&quot;, but it&#x27;s not going to be as flexible as a chainable wrapper system.<p>Hell, I could probably give you pretty close to that in python with a little work, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d want to use myself.<p>I get it. I like working in SQL too. I know it really really well, and I cringe when I see developers writing totally sub-optimal code because they don&#x27;t understand the relational data model.<p>But there are other ways to do things, and what you&#x27;re describing doesn&#x27;t give you much more than raw SQL, so why not just use raw SQL? You&#x27;ve added some syntactic sugar that, in my language (Python), would be a bit of a horror show (strings access local variables implicitly, no thanks). What else do you gain?<p>This is more verbose, granted:<p><pre><code>    q = session.query(Products)
    if title:
        q = q.filter(Products.title.like(title))
    if price_range:
        q = q.filter(Products.price.lte(price_range))
    if offset:
        q = q.offset(offset)
    if limit:
        q = q.limit(limit)
    products = q.all()
</code></pre>
But then you get more stuff for free, like drilling down into the other tables:<p><pre><code>    p = products[0]
    p.supplier.contracts[0]
</code></pre>
But that&#x27;s rubbish, because you&#x27;ll be loading in a really inefficient way. That&#x27;s ok though, tell the system how you&#x27;re going to want to load the additional data.<p><pre><code>    q = q.options(
        joinedload(&#x27;supplier&#x27;).
        subqueryload(&#x27;contracts&#x27;)
    )
</code></pre>

In some cases, it wholly depends on your other characteristics.<p>If you&#x27;re weird + (strongly positive basket of traits), then your weirdness might actually be seen as a positive qualifier on your other traits. If I&#x27;m a rockstar engineer, heads and tails above anyone else at my company, and I smoke an antique meerschaum pipe on my lunch break, people might find me charmingly idiosyncratic, and possibly some sort of genius. The pipe might actually add to people&#x27;s perceptions of my competence. But if I&#x27;m of average or mediocre competence at work and I smoke the same pipe, I&#x27;ll be seen as strange and possibly unstable. In this case it&#x27;s not the weirdness that has changed; it&#x27;s the way people have <i>processed</i> my weirdness, in light of their other assumptions about me. Vint Cerf gets social <i>credit</i> for wearing a three-piece suit to work everyday; an entry-level Googler would get socially docked for it.<p>The pipe, or the suit, in this case, is an example of what we might call socially neutral weirdness -- the kind of eccentricity whose social value depends on other variables. On the other hand, you have types of weirdness with fixed and/or independent social values, such as political stances. If I&#x27;m a staunch libertarian, that&#x27;s going to strike some people as offputting and some people as attractive, regardless of how people think of me in other respects.<p>I think it is probably wise to budget the former type of weirdness very sparingly, and to signal the latter type of weirdness only in pursuit of specific social goals. In absence of any other known quantities about me, or hard and fast opinions about me, the pipe has very little social upside at work. And the politics probably have no upside at work, plus a lot of potential downside, unless I happen to work among a group of fellow travelers. You&#x27;re allowed to impose a larger cognitive load on your peers in proportion to the degree to which they hold you in high esteem.

Should we then secure TCP, so that we can ensure availability and prevent attackers from exploiting it to introduce byzantine routing failures?

There&#x27;s some good news: you have recognised this, and you want to change things.<p>In England: your employer has a duty to protect you from harm in the workplace. This includes stress, anxiety or depression. Your employer may have an occupational health telephone helpline. Some people say they don&#x27;t trust employer provided helplines. You could go private: BACP are reputable accreditors for psychological therapies. Or you can use NHS services: do a websearch for your county name and words like &quot;talking therapy&quot; or maybe &quot;cbt&quot;. These should take self-referral, but if not you go to your GP and ask for a talking therapy.<p>Early intervention is important: recovery is quicker and stronger if intervention is early and good.<p>There are also self-guided systems if you don&#x27;t want to see anyone.  Search for &quot;books on prescription&quot; to see curated lists of sensible books. &quot;Mind Over Mood&quot; is one that&#x27;s frequently recommended.<p>There&#x27;s an Austrailian website: <a href=""https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/</a><p>I recently spoke to about 50 different local employers about mental illness and work and they were all keen to do the right thing and to learn about mental health.  So if you recognise something that would improve things for you at work it might be worth just having a chat with them.<p>Finally: if you find things getting worse it might be worthwhile to create a &quot;rainy day action plan&quot;. This would be a list of things that would trigger you into going to see your GP. For example, if you start having suicidal thoughts you should go and see someone.  The rainy day action plan is normally used with severe enduring mental illness and can cover Advanced Directives, but they&#x27;re useful for mild to moderate illness too.",1426022233

We&#x27;ve been accumulating knowledge for a long time. Sure, in the 1500s there were people who were top of the class in physics, chemistry, and biology. I&#x27;m sure many, many people here know (or could readily learn) those as well as the great polymaths, and come up with novel new-to-the-1500s-models ideas. But physics, for one, has gone so far beyond what we understood back then.<p>You&#x27;re impressed by people inventing calculus? Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty impressive. It&#x27;s also something a fairly intelligent person these days can at least _understand_ as a young teen.

So if you have such a card, OpenBSD defaults to the &quot;nv&quot; driver, which somehow manages to be about 20x slower than the VESA driver, <i>before MTRR write-combine tweaking</i> (side tangent: OpenBSD also lacks an MTRR tweaking tool, like memcontrol.) Moving a window literally locks up your desktop for 30-90 seconds as you see it slowly redrawing its way along. How they managed that one I will never know, but they did.<p>I&#x27;m all for open source all the way, especially on a secure system, but OpenBSD+nVidia is basically unusable on the desktop. And that&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> class of systems. You can&#x27;t buy Intel PCIe cards; and AMD drivers are always a buggy mess.<p>> PF version runs on multiple cpus (OpenBSD&#x27;s version is more advanced though)<p>I really hate the trade-off of FreeBSD SMP support, or OpenBSD queuing support. (yes, you can compile a FreeBSD kernel with ALTQ, but it&#x27;s said to be buggy with SMP.)",1426021319

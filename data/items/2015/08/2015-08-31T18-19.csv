I wonder if the big ones like unreal, unity and crysis are going to collapse sometime under their own weight... How are they even adding all those new features without breaking stuff all the time?<p>Apart from technical answers for good engineering practice, I&#x27;d just say they do it with money (engineering time). And as long as gamers keep drooling at next-gen graphics, they&#x27;ll merrily keep maintaining this beast they&#x27;ve assembled :)<p>UE vs. the indie engines you mention are very different economical animals. Where these indie engines are made by volunteers or small/medium teams, UE is built by the huge team at Epic, they&#x27;ve been doing it for years, it will cost you (a <i>&quot;5% royalty based on gross revenue&quot;</i> [1]).<p>So, not diminishing their technical prowesses at all, just reminding they pursue a juicy market which <i>wants</i> these weighty features so that their new AAA games stay on top of whatever new hardware and graphics advancements without having to research/implement those themselves.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.unrealengine.com/custom-licensing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.unrealengine.com/custom-licensing</a>",1441047489

Sure, we do, but honestly we can probably get that by being smarter with our code atm. Like I said - it&#x27;s pretty legacy in many (most) areas.<p>And to be fair - it was much closer to the 10% figure most of the time than the 20. Sometimes less.<p>Given our kind of unoptimized dev flow (for JS anyhow, we&#x27;re pretty good overall) it meant that Closure was just... more of a pain in the ass (for many reasons, the JVM didn&#x27;t help either, yet another moving part).<p>So we chose dev productivity over it. When our codebase is more streamlined and modern-looking I think we&#x27;ll re-evaluate and <i>trust me</i> Closure will be on that list.<p>> have you tried it recently?<p>About 6 months ago. Was better, just not as smooth a flow and fast as Uglify was. Glad to hear that it&#x27;s an ongoing effort though.<p>> My view is generally, it&#x27;s better to spend time at compile time.<p>Generally I&#x27;d agree... if it wasn&#x27;t that our dev flow often had to include compiles (due to... reasons I can&#x27;t get into here). This is a problem we&#x27;re working to fix on our end but it did make Closure a lot more annoying, unfortunately. We <i>did</i> used to use it, so I&#x27;m not talking from a position of not having used it here :)<p>> Generally the larger the app, the more likely transitive dead code will be pulled into the initial download without something like CC.<p>Generally agree. However we have a LOT of strange orphan code (that we&#x27;re clearing up) which means our dead-code was surprisingly low <i>across the project</i> while perhaps still dead code <i>at some specific point of access</i>.<p>Annoying? Yes. Edge case? Perhaps. I think it&#x27;s more common in large old projects than any developer would like unfortunately.<p>Thankfully there is roadmap and we WILL be evaluating Closure when we get further along. Like I said - I used to be the main cheerleader for it here.",1441047446

I could learn so many things already and thanks to large engines like UE, I can learn even more every day. The larger engines are often used at huge companies, where they can make use of pretty much every single feature sooner or later.<p>I love writing everything from scratch just for the sake of learning. And yet I love engines like UE for trying new stuff and real world projects.<p>In large code bases, automatic testing significantly facilitates adding new features. I don&#x27;t really know how they test UE, though.",1441047367

This is what impresses me most.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at their code, but I would bet they have fantastic regression tests.  Something I&#x27;ve added to my own engine in the past year is &quot;pixel perfect&quot; tests: for a given test scene employing specific effects (soft shadows, reflections, refraction, etc) the renderer should produce an image that is a pixel perfect match with a known correct image.  If you begin optimizing shaders and rendering code, regressions are caught very quickly, in an automated way.  Sometimes the images are close enough to be acceptable (for example, if an optimization changed floating point precision, resulting in a color that is a shade different).

But if you&#x27;ve got a 3.6M LOC shipping to consumers and not a B2B/intranet app, I can&#x27;t believe you wouldn&#x27;t care about an extra 10-20% dead code stripping, that&#x27;s a non-trivial improvement.<p>Also, have you tried it recently? AFAIK, there was performance work done on it over the past year or so, speeding up the type checker and other parts of the compiler.<p>My view is generally, it&#x27;s better to spend time at compile time.  Even if a fully optimized build took 10 minutes, it&#x27;s not a big deal. Even in an uncompiled mode, presumably your integration tests on a large app can take minutes to run anyway, and with such a large app, you may have a Q/A process as well.  That is, your releases will be gated by other factors, not compile times, and so a few extra minutes to save 100k downloads * number of users is a big benefit for your user base and a few minutes of your time.<p>I would say that if you have any deferred loading, CC&#x27;s cross module code motion is a fear that all of the other existing tools lack and it can get you far far more than 10% reduction of your initial load depending on how your app is written. Generally the larger the app, the more likely transitive dead code will be pulled into the initial download without something like CC.",1441046729

It doesn&#x27;t though :(<p>> engineers at Google typically develop code in uncompiled mode<p>Well we did that too, but when we had to bundle everything and compile.. it sucked. We managed to get it down to about ~3 minutes with less advanced options but at that point Uglify was on par with it size-wise so... <i>shrugs</i><p>We took development time over a minor (basically insignificant) startup latency improvement.<p>>  on a large codebase [..] the type checking provided by Closure is invaluable.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with this but I find it best to separate the two out (for example, with something like Flow, etc) rather than have the whole bundle/compile step fail.

  > Virtualization seems to have a lot of security benefits.

  You&#x27;ve been smoking something really mind altering, and I think you
  should share it.

  x86 virtualization is about basically placing another nearly full
  kernel, full of new bugs, on top of a nasty x86 architecture which
  barely has correct page protection.  Then running your operating
  system on the other side of this brand new pile of shit.

  You are absolutely deluded, if not stupid, if you think that a
  worldwide collection of software engineers who can&#x27;t write operating
  systems or applications without security holes, can then turn around
  and suddenly write virtualization layers without security holes.

  You&#x27;ve seen something on the shelf, and it has all sorts of pretty
  colours, and you&#x27;ve bought it.

  That&#x27;s all x86 virtualization is.</code></pre>",1441046093

My experience has been that remote work requires greater discipline. Complex projects have twists and turns, many variables. One has to learn to over communicate to ensure that one is not building the wrong thing. This is harder to do over hangouts mainly because it is tougher to gauge interpersonal dynamics of a room.<p>Coding is the easiest part of large scale projects. Harder problems are stakeholder management, ensuring we are building the right thing and ensuring that information flows freely. I am on a project that spans Boston, NY and Stockholm. We all know what we want to build. Yet, every two weeks or so, I find myself traveling. Mainly to ensure that we react fast as we learn more about unknowns. Are we all on the same page? This is sustainable for a company that can afford to depute a few people to do this. For a tiny startup that has to be agile enough to pivot immediately, it is harder to do so when all your handful of engineers are remote.<p>Personally, I would hire someone remote if it was a very well defined chunk of work. At that point, I may as well hire a contractor. IMO, the value of an engineer is not just to write code, it is to solve business problems.",1441045249

Couple-few things:

Checkpointed latex with easy access to Sage code is great for collaboration, far better than subversion or (shudder) dropbox.

I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s an effective strategy, but merely that it is one that people choose.  If governments looked at policies not just from a &quot;how can we make people do what we want&quot; perspective but also from a &quot;how can we make compliance simple and straightforward&quot; perspective they could quite literally move the needle on misery.<p>It&#x27;s not that any one particular thing that a human being has to do to stay alive and legal is an impossible burden, it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s no &quot;department of if this is reasonable&quot; and &quot;the total cost of compliance on society department&quot; or &quot;how many hours a year does a person have to spend on forms bureau&quot; and so you end up with a death-by-a-thousand-papercuts kind of situation.<p>Going to the DMV is irritating but tolerable, so is registering your car, so is paying your taxes, so are X, Y and Z.  But by the time you add it all up you&#x27;re probably working an extra week or two every year unpaid, and you don&#x27;t get time off from work to make it happen during the government&#x27;s business hours which decidedly aren&#x27;t before 9am nor after 5pm.<p>Because the choice of what government you &quot;patronize&quot; has very high switching costs and the barriers to entry are insurmountably high (except for the most dedicated of revolutionaries) we get very little choice and a lot of things that could be better -- if only someone somewhere would bother to care -- don&#x27;t happen because there&#x27;s very little real pressure to improve them.  I&#x27;m libertarian because I think governments are shitty and uncaring, not because I&#x27;m a true anarchist.

They show the p-value (at whatever level of data was collected when the paper was written) over the parameter space that is being searched. You can see that the values observed have a clear separation -- most are close to 1 (null-hypothesis holds) with just one significant dip towards 0 (null-hypothesis doesn&#x27;t hold). If you were to animate this graph with the p-values over time (as more observations are made), you would see the trend towards 0 or 1 much clearer.<p>The Boson experimenters would expect a (1 - p) reproduction rate for the next observation made (if the null-hypothesis holds). That is, the next observation has a p probability of fitting within the parameters of the null-hypothesis and (1-p) probability that it is inconsistent with the null-hypothesis. Why would they expect that? Because the math involved in telling you whether or not that is what you should expect is exactly what p-value calculates (again, assuming a well-formed experiement -- which the Higgs experiments probably are).<p>But again, when the null-hypothesis doesn&#x27;t hold, p-value tells you very little (it&#x27;s actually undefined in the math).",1441044616

If you value your own work differently, that&#x27;s fine, but yours will be the minority opinion.<p>Overall low career pay to work difficulty ratio in comparison to other fields is a clear signal for young people to not pursue that option as a career.  Despite the trope about falling education standards, the young people entering college and choosing their concentrations are not entirely stupid.  They know that they won&#x27;t get a job in the art field with that degree in art history.

Get a bachelor&#x27;s degree and go to work.  If you wanted to be a doctor or lawyer, be a nurse or paralegal instead.  Trade up later, if you can earn enough by working to pay for the extra degree, and you like doing that kind of work.  My personal opinion is that <i>nobody</i> should be trying to pursue advanced degrees without ever doing any work in the real world first.

This is for a similar service (LaTeX is just subset of what SageMathCloud does, but a resource heavy subset). However, ShareLaTeX handles orders of magnitude more traffic as far as I can tell. One of the big factors in a service like this is being able to get the cost-per-user down low enough that it&#x27;s a viable business model given that a student/academic is not going to pay more than about $10/month and most won&#x27;t pay at all.<p>One of the big wins for us has been using Docker to isolate projects. Sure, each project is resource heavy when run/compiled/executed, but if you have lots of users, they&#x27;re probably not all resource heavy at the same time. The more lightweight the virtualisation/containers, the more they can share resources.

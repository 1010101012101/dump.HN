Rather, Arc is ""weakly typed"".  The same bit of program data can be interpreted as different types depending upon the context where it's used.  (This is distinct from strong-but-dynamic-typing like in Scheme or Python, where you have to explicitly convert between types.)  It joins the club of Perl, PHP, and assembly in this regard.<p>I mentioned elsewhere on this thread that I think this is the right design decision given Arc's design principles, but that those design principles are flawed.  In my experience, bugs resulting from implicit coercions are rare, but they're also <i>really difficult</i> to track down.  That was a major reason I switched from PHP to Python.",1183927940

It means that someone finds the information from a specific site to be so useful that they want to receive every update from the site so they can at least take a glance at it. Votes on specific links are a far less valuable indicator of reputation. No one wants to see everything that's submitted to Scribd; a few things just happen to get voted to the top of social networking sites because they're funny or interesting. That doesn't say anything meaningful about Scribd's reputation.<p>Google has a huge advantage in this area since they collect which items from an RSS feed people actually read on Google Reader. They know that even though I subscribe to the del.icio.us/popular and digg RSS feeds, I rarely read any of the items, whereas I read almost everything from dive into mark or Jeremy Zawodny's blog.<p>As far as the output is concerned, it doesn't have to be traditional ""output"" at all. It can be an increased PageRank for a site, or a Firefox extension that shows a reputation meter for every site you visit.<p>The format isn't important, but the things people subscribe to are very important.",1183927681
33125,comment,363,32964,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Arc is supposed to be a LFSP.  Smart people adjust their user model to the tools they have available (right?), so it's at least consistent with Arc's design principles.<p>It's not the choice I would've made - I tend to agree with you that ""explicit is better than implicit"".  But languages all have to make certain assumptions about who their users are (same with UIs, really), and this design decision is consistent with Arc's previously-stated design philosophy.",1183927477

You have to be respectful of people's time. If, e.g., you show Java people the code for the Scala compiler, when it was being bootstrapped in Java, and the > 2x LOC reduction when they were able to rewrite it in Scala to make the language self-hosting, Java programmers still wouldn't care, even though that's an example where the code bases are > 10K LOC.",1183925963

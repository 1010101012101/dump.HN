Please do watch the earlier review of their work I suggested - <a href=""http://plantpositive.com/warning-signs-nusi-guys-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plantpositive.com/warning-signs-nusi-guys-1/</a><p>The healthful HCLF diets you&#x27;re seeking out are known as plant-based (usually vegan, but not exclusively) diets, and are always lauded as health-promoting, albeit supposedly &quot;unpalpable&quot;.<p>Low-fat meaning, low in or void of saturated- and trans-fatty acids, high (10-15% of caloric intake) in essential polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (in the right ratio, ideally 1:1, but more practically, 1:3 or 1:5). Yet, many media outlets and conflict of interest research have no shame in claiming a diet as high as 30, 40, even 50 percent fat (always from animal products) are &quot;low&quot;. This is simply nonsense! Your body needs only a little bit of fat, for example to increase vitamin absorption at each meal, or convert it to EPA/DHA.<p>High-carb meaning, the majority of calories are derived from whole, unrefined, plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruit, legumes and whole grains, especially ones low on the glycemic index (e.g. brown rice, whole grain pasta, beans, dark green leafy veg, colorful fruit variation, etc.)<p>Heck, I challenge you to find me a study which says a high-carb, low-fat diet as I&#x27;ve described is not a great recipe for human nutrition. Unfortunately, so many people find such a diet unreasonable for practical, social and other, personal reasons. Also unfortunate is the fact there&#x27;s little money to be made in promoting these simple and unprocessed foods, so the academic world is not determined to research them.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re interested in reading more about these sort of diets, check out the work by Colin Campbell, John McDougall, Neal Barnard, Dean Ornish, to name a few. I&#x27;ve fully embraced the dietary lifestyle recommended by them and others, and can only praise the mental clarity, increased energy and satiation experienced as a result. I really believe the &quot;trick&quot; is to cut out processed and animal product foods altogether (at least to the degree you can sustainably practice and at the pace you find to be reasonable) - they&#x27;re just unnecessary! Sure, it&#x27;s anecdotal evidence, but I figure it&#x27;s worth sharing with you.",1449179594

The latter statement appears to imply that he stole someone else&#x27;s work and then unduly passed it off as his own. The idea that someone might take credit for another&#x27;s hard work is usually the source of any disgust directed towards acts of plagiarism. On the other hand &quot;sued for sounding like himself&quot; more accurately captures the nuance of this situation where the artist actually authored the original material but is then accused of writing a song that sounds similar to the original even though he doesn&#x27;t legally own the rights to the original.<p>> <i>And now we&#x27;ve got some dumb new falsehood floating around whenever people talk about record companies and music publishing. &quot;You can literally be sued for sounding like yourself!</i><p>Well, I don&#x27;t feel like that is a dumb falsehood or an unfair characterization, he was quite literally sued for writing a song that sounds similar to a different song that he also wrote; no, he didn&#x27;t legally own the song, but in the context of criticism against the record industry, having a record label come after you because they think your new work sounds too similar to your old work that you sold off sounds like a quintessential example of why artists and their fans resent big labels.",1449179470

The PDP-7 had hardware that supported auto-increment-by-one, and Ritchie suggests that&#x27;s where ++ came from.<p>The PDP-7 assembler manual is at <a href=""http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/pdp7/PDP-7_AsmMan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/pdp7/PD...</a>, but I can&#x27;t see any reference to this auto-increment hardware, or to an assembler directive using it.  What I&#x27;m getting at is that there appears not to have been an assembly language construct for auto-increment on the PDP-7 at all, even though its hardware supported it.<p>The hardware &quot;auto-indexing&quot; is described at page 3-12 of the PDP-7 architecture document, <a href=""http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/pdp7/F-75P_PDP7prelimUM_Dec64.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/pdp7/F-...</a> .

They were not in the earliest versions of B, but appeared along the way. People often guess that they were created to use the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes provided by the DEC PDP-11 on which C and Unix first became popular. This is historically impossible, since there was no PDP-11 when B was developed.<p>&quot;The PDP-7, however, did have a few `auto-increment&#x27; memory cells, with the property that an indirect memory reference through them incremented the cell. This feature probably suggested such operators to Thompson; the generalization to make them both prefix and postfix was his own. Indeed, the auto-increment cells were not used directly in implementation of the operators, and a stronger motivation for the innovation was probably his observation that the translation of ++x was smaller than that of x=x+1.&quot;",1449178341

And a less naive reader will still be left with no guidance on how to make real-world decisions if you weren&#x27;t so lucky as to get a strong statistical result.<p>Here is a much, much simpler strategy that I can suggest for business users.<p>1. Figure out the longest that you can afford to run your test for.<p>2. Figure out the number of conversions N you expect in that time.<p>3. Start running your test, randomly splitting visitors into A and B.<p>4. Stop the test as soon as one version has sqrt(N) more conversions than the other.  Else wait until you get to N conversions between them, and go with what is ahead.<p>Here are some comments on the procedure.<p>Stopping before N/2 total conversions is roughly the same certainty as stopping at 95% confidence.  Stopping after that is an admission that you are crossing your fingers and going with an educated guess, and it is not feasible to collect enough data to get a better answer.<p>If one version has a conversion rate which is (1 + 2/sqrt(n)) better than the other, you pretty reliably choose right.  The flip side of this is that you&#x27;ll make a lot of mistakes if you get much below that threshold.  If those potential errors are too big, then A/B testing is not going to work well for you because you don&#x27;t have enough data for statistics.",1449178323

10672613,comment,10662461,10672383,0,0,pron,,,"> Of course, none of this justifies pron&#x27;s suspicion of linguistic models of computation.<p>Of course. :)<p>But my view stems from the following belief that finally brings us back to your original point and my original response: there can be no (classical) mathematical justification to what you call linguistic models of computation because computation is not (classical) math, as it does not preserve equality under substitution. The implication I draw from this is not quite the one you may attribute to me such as an overall suspicion, complete rejection or dismissal of those models, but the recognition that their entire justification is not mathematical but pragmatic, and that means that the very same (practical) reasons that might make us adopt the (leaky) abstraction of those models, might lead us to adopt (or even prefer) other models that are justified by pragmatism alone -- such as empirical results showing a certain &quot;affinity&quot; to human cognition -- even if they don&#x27;t try to abstract computation as classical math.",1449176496

For one, the pieces are generally finished there they connect, which means you are gluing to a lacquer on at least one side (possibly both!), and wood glue really wants a porous surface like unfinished wood. Another reason is that much flat-pack furniture (less so Ikea) is super cheap particle board that simply isn&#x27;t strong enough to support the much weight from its surface like you would force it to with glue.<p>When used properly, however, wood glue is indeed shockingly strong.",1449176442

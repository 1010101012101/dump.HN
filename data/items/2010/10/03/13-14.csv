Highly recommended, but it's not an easy read, so be forewarned. It's short enough that you can easily power through it on a plane ride or whenever you have downtime.<p>A little while back, i started reading DFW's ""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,"" a collection of shortish essays. DFW's writing is a bit like Douglas Adams where you really start to think and write like he does if you're not careful.<p>Both Pynchon and Wallace though, have a ridiculous command of the english language, so it makes for really engaging but sometimes challenging reading.<p>Have fun!",1286114380

IMHO, when you go the non-IDE route, you will forgo some features you are used to and satisfy those needs with alternative mechanisms.  This is my personal preference.  It's a bit of a learning curve, but I think you end up with a much better understanding how your code fits together.",1286114374

Other compilers (except clang) not so much.<p>FWIW, GCC 4.2.1 on OSX 10.6 silently accepts<p><pre><code>  x += ++x;\n</code></pre>\nby default. -Wall catches it, at least. I'm trying to think of a reason why the warning might not be on by default - I can only assume it's either lumped in with some other, less reliable undefined behaviour detection, such as aliasing. -Wall doesn't even catch trivial cases of aliasing though, such as<p><pre><code>  int* y = &x;\n  x += ++*y;\n</code></pre>\nMaybe it's the default in a newer version, or this is Apple messing with me, not GNU.",1286114307

I did exactly what hga notes otherwise here when I used Visual Studio--I edited with Emacs, compiled and built with VS.<p>I now use Emacs for everything. It has just enough pieces to be able to configure the task you want to do.  In particular, I make heavy use of key mappings, for example, F11 to the compile command, which defaults to ""make -k -f Makefile"".<p>VIM is highly configurable--several at work use it.

But then, not every employer responds well to that sort of thing either. I've tried this same approach more than once, and it's never worked yet. Not a valid statistical sample, but people seem to be afraid to hire someone who is forthright.<p>Although, I don't think it's a question of whether I'm forthright or not, that's too simple. The whole interview process, starting with the initial letter/application is actually a kind of mating ritual. If you get the sequence right back and forth, then you get a chance to get hired. If you don't get the sequence right then you make people feel uncomfortable, and they won't hire you probably.<p>Basically, by being brash during this process, you make people wonder if you're capable of the mating ritual, and if you aren't, then why not? Are you socially inept? Professionally incompetent?<p>The off chance that you're perfectly ept and competent, but have just chosen to apply for a job in an unconventional way is too great a risk for most people, so they pass, and look for the next guy who follows the rules of the ritual.",1286113218

In German, window is ""fenster"" and in French it is ""fenetre"" (with some symbol over the second e indicating that there used to be an S before the T in old French).  So that makes ""fenetre"" easier for me rather than remembering it directly as ""window"".  In German, ""flasche"" is usually translated as ""bottle"".  I remember it is ""flask"" first and foremost, which makes it easier for me.<p>I also transliterate rather than translate -- ie translate word for word instead of translating it actually into the grammar of my native language.  When I took classical Greek, we had interlinear bibles that showed each word in English below the word in Greek.  I had no trouble making sense of this, though it didn't make sense to other people.  I was the only person in my Greek class who could read a passage in Greek and then tell you what it said in English.  I was the most fluent person in that class.  It also helps me familiarize myself with the grammatical differences between two languages.<p>Good luck with this.",1286112506

However, if someone says, ""Before Facebook there was MySpace and ICQ and Compuserve and Orkut and all of these foundered and died, Facebook is just the latest fad, it will die as well,"" we can analyze the claim directly and ask whether Facebook is a fad and if not, how it differs from the examples cited.",1286111889

The assessment could be a different depending on what you're studying; maybe a conversation with a native speaker on the subject of what you've been studying that week.  Maybe a trial run of a standardized test you're studying for.  Maybe watching the same TV show at 3 week intervals to see how much your comprehension improves.  Depending on the result, then plan your text 2-3 weeks of study accordingly.

Asian culture had a tremendous influence, even if somewhat misunderstood or reinterpreted, on the West. Our exam system in universities is inspired by the Chinese. People like Voltaire did admire Confucius' way to (not) talk about God. Leibniz was impressed by Yi-king's numerical perfection. Etc. (I agree that the zen-this and dao-that we have nowadays is an uninformed Western distortion, though).<p>Edit: And I dislike the quote in the article. I read Daode Jing many time, in different translation, and I don't remember having seen this. Anyway, any quotation of Chinese classics that do not give the reference is deemed to be a joke (like those Confucius said jokes).",1286111292
1752651,comment,1752139,1752139,0,0,RockyMcNuts,,,"Philosophy<p>The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the World's Greatest Philosophers, by Will Durant. Written in the 30s, it covers some philosophers who would not be considered influential today, and doesn't do justice to the 20th century. But it's a relatively easy read, and clarified some guys I either didn't read or didn't appreciate in my freshman great books seminar.<p>Walden and Civil Disobedience, by  Henry David Thoreau. Ah, the wisdom. Likewise The Essential Gandhi, by Mahatma Gandhi. Haven't read all of it or even as much as I should, but his autobiography of his early years and experiments with truth are the story of a great soul.<p>The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self & Soul by Douglas R. Hofstadter. Various attempts to reconcile the mind-body dichotomy and build a science of cognition.<p>Human behavior<p>The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal, by Desmond Morris. If you ask people why they act the way they do, they will probably talk about rational, moral, idealistic justifications... but if you were a primatologist, what would you say about why humans act the way they do? Morris, a zoologist familiar with great apes, describes how human behavior may owe much to ape biology and society as well as to big brains and rational and spiritual pretensions.<p>Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective by Peter L. Berger. Humans don't really have the capacity to create new behaviors on the fly when faced with new situations, or to respond in real time to new behaviors in others. Instead people internalize roles and scripts that they act out in daily life with small variations, interpret others' actions in light of performances they have seen before, and collectively build shared narratives in a 'social construction of reality'.<p>How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life by Thomas Gilovich. A grand tour of the fallibility of homo economicus, and reality torturing heuristic shortcuts that lead us astray.<p>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, by Robert B. Cialdini. How markets, salesmen, lawyers, small children and other devious hucksters take advantage of our decisionmaking shortcuts for fun and profit.<p>Happier: Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment by Tal Ben-Shahar. Came upon these after reading about his lectures, the most popular at Harvard. A lot of very sound advice to have a more positive outlook. I wish this influenced me more LOL.  But applying it is no mean feat. Dan Gilbert also has Stumbling on Happiness, but haven't read that, and Gretchen Rubin, niece of Robert, has a bestseller - happiness is turning into a self-help fad and industry, but it seems empirically based and common sensical.<p>Economics<p>The Road to Serfdom, by F. A. Hayek. A powerful case against government overreaching and socialism. Focuses on the long run dynamism, information efficiency and evolutionary adaptability of markets which is lost when governments attempt to tame their shorter term inequities. Capitalism and Freedom is also strong, but Friedman, while brilliant, was somewhat more ideological, simplistic and one-sided.<p>Fortunes Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street, by William Poundstone. Ties together the common quests of pioneers of information theory, investors, and degenerate gamblers and mobsters.<p>Fiction<p>The Razor's Edge, Somerset Maugham. A case study of ways in which different types of motivation can dominate different people in constructive and destructive ways.<p>The Jewel in the Crown, by Paul Scott. In each chapter, a different character relates a Rashomon-like point of view of a shocking crime, and through them a mystery is explained, and a complex portrait of India's many faces is revealed.<p>I have a soft spot for satirical Brit-novels, like Vanity Fair, The Way We Live Now, and Wodehouse.<p>Biography<p>Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, by Roger Lowenstein. An insightful biography of the greatest living investor, or maybe of all time.<p>Gates, by Manes and Andrews, is also very good.<p>Science<p>Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the New Physics, by Gary Zukav, and The Tao of Physics, by Fritjof Capra, on the unbearable elusiveness of reality. If a particle is just a probability density function of potential interactions with other particles, does the substance of reality reside in the particle, or in the interaction?<p>Grammatical Man : Information, Entropy, Language and Life, by Jeremy Campbell. Is the substance of reality matter or information, or are they the same? If biology is applied chemistry, which is applied physics, which is applied mathematics, maybe  mathematics is the study of formal systems, which is a subset of things that can be computed and decided, ie computer science, which is a subset of things can be expressed and communicated, ie information theory.<p>The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics by Roger Penrose, a massive grand tour of scientific knowledge and big questions of the late 20th century. When you get done with that, go for the sequel, The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe... I haven't yet, but good luck!",1286111115

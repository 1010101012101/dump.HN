There are a number of high quality CMS systems available, and just being familiar with one isn't a sufficient reason to use it.<p>You may even find that a CMS doesn't provide much for you beyond what you can get with a nice framework in your language of choice, evaluate these before settling on the defaults at hand.  <p>I've written some code in Drupal, and while it has many strengths, its level of abstraction away from just writing simple PHP code in my mind doesn't really differentiate it from a framework... and in the framework space, there are some nicer options available to you.",1198464519

92321,comment,92291,92291,0,0,alanmccann,,,"Depends what you want to build...
1. Do you want to build a pretty state of the art community focused more on the content than on unique features - than it could be a good choice
2. Do you want to build a unique feature driven site? - maybe a traditional framework would be better
3. Do you want to take an agile development approach to building your community - it is a good choice<p>I would recommend putting your site concept out to the drupal community and getting advice from them (drupal.org)",1198463776

If you use CPM, then it puts this pressure back on the buyer).<p>No problems at all with OpenAds (and phpAdsNew before it). Does everything I've ever needed over the past 3 years.",1198462722

The people who understand it best <i>should</i> be in control, regardless of how much equity they give to investors.

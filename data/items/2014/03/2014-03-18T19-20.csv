Scalable content creation has solutions also, i.e. 3d scanning and procedural generation.<p>Real time path tracing is where its at these days, not ray tracing anymore.<p>All of this stuff can go in hardware and it will within a few years.

7424527,comment,7423394,7423394,5,0,a-priori,,,"Dogecoin is interesting. On one hand, it&#x27;s all an elaborate joke and everyone involved knows it. On the other hand, it&#x27;s got a higher transaction volume than its &#x27;serious&#x27; cousin Bitcoin, and people occasionally use it to transfer significant amounts of money (e.g. here, and the Jamaican Bobsled Team).<p>The biggest problem a currency has to overcome is the network effect. It&#x27;s damned hard to bootstrap a currency, to get people to start -- and continue -- to use it instead of some other currency. With conventional currencies, that&#x27;s typically done by governments requiring taxes to be paid in it. This has the effect of basically guaranteeing that everyone also receives their income in it as well and makes it difficult for another currency to sneak in. Taxes basically anchor the national economy onto the national currency.<p>With crypto-currencies, that&#x27;s not an option since there&#x27;s no government to levy taxes. But Bitcoin did something similar through vices: the Silk Road and Satoshi Dice got people using Bitcoin and money into the economy because they wanted to use it for drug trafficking and gambling. Because both of those sites only accepted Bitcoin, and they&#x27;re either illegal or highly restricted in the normal economy, they acted as an anchor to convince people to adopt Bitcoin and move money into and out of its economy. Once bootstrapped, it&#x27;s now being used for other, more legitimate, purposes.<p>Dogecoin is bootstrapping itself in a different way, through indiscriminate tipping and charity. It&#x27;s using this kind of frivolous spending as a way of getting its transaction volume up and bootstrapping exchanges between Dogecoin and Bitcoin and USD. I could see it moving up to micro-transactions of some kind -- something small, perhaps still a joke of some kind, but for transactions (i.e, receiving something in return) rather than donation. Who knows, maybe one day we all woke up, and without realizing it Dogecoin has gone from a joke, to a joke people use for real stuff around the edges, to a real currency with a joke around the edges?",1395172115

Castle of the Winds, Rogue, Nethack, and more were 100% dynamically generated.<p>Truly dynamic agents existed in Rollercoaster Tycoon, where <i>every single person</i> that walked into your theme park would have Nausia ratings, money, and make individual decisions at every point in the game. G-force was measured on every ride, and would effect different people in different ways. The amount of vomit in front of rides would disgust people in differing amounts. Etc. etc.<p>True AIs, agent theory and dynamic games were the norm in the mid-to-late 90s. But this approach to gaming isn&#x27;t what people want. The truth of the matter, is that what makes money are these pre-scripted game-movies that sorta-kinda look photorealistic.<p>In fact, true-AIs have been implemented in games by probably every game development team. When AIs fear for their own life and run away from players (instead of standing and fighting), players tend to get bored. When AIs become so good at the game that they crush the player, players become frustrated and quit.<p>Believe it or not, few people are willing to put up with realistic and dynamic challenges. There are no game guides, no assistance, no &quot;help menu&quot; when a game is created dynamically. It is hard to share experiences with friends, because everyone is sort-of playing a different game.",1395172068

For example, They probably even have a machine that does it for them, or special tools. Furthermore, it allows the cost to be consistent, otherwise they would have to charge per page and the user might not be aware of how many pages are in their notebook, so they might not know the cost ahead of time. I have a notebook at home and I can&#x27;t even fathom a guess as to how many pages it is, I am sure that the sticker or whatever was on it when I bought it told me, but that is long gone. It also allows them to only process orders that are cost effective for them - minimum page requirements, consistent cost, pages that are optimal for their scanners, they know exactly what is going to come in, known cost of shipping so they can know exactly the amount of postage they have to pay, etc.",1395171138

This interviewer was the CTO of this particular, rather success, start-up and had formerly worked at other very large and success companies all over the Bay area.<p>My very first instinct and the thing I started to do was write tests on the board to make sure I understood the requirements. The interviewer stopped me and said &quot;Please, just get to the code, the tests are not important.&quot; I tried to explain that the tests are paramount to the success of an implementation because I need to make sure I understand the requirements. However, the interviewer disagreed. I actually told them I was no longer interested in interviewing with their company and excused myself without writing anything further on the board. The funny part is that the next day the CTO in question called and offered me a very nice position (I respectfully declined after a discussion of my concerns).<p>So, two points. One, not all interviewers care about tests, which is sad. Two, the original post states, &quot;you don’t get to choose how you get interviewed&quot;.

That would be real Mac support.<p>Yes! In fact, I&#x27;ve given talks on using Xcode&#x27;s Instruments.app with Rust! You get full support for Rust with it. There are also actual up-to-date Cocoa bindings, which Servo uses.<p>I have no idea where you have gotten the idea that Rust cares only about Linux.<p>> You just gave a nice example of lacking cultural competence by assuming that not providing a binary installer which does not require manual twiddling is just as acceptable on Windows as on Linux, while it really sends a bad message on Windows and leads to Windows developers never bothering with Rust at all. It is like, nobody on Windows has a problem with closed source drivers .. but the Linux devs hate those.. bad culture fit. It matters, a lot.<p>We aren&#x27;t done with the language yet. There is no reason why we can&#x27;t ship a binary installer.<p>> Well, that is great. However, I remain highly skeptical. I can already see the install instruction for Rust libraries on Github etc. &quot;Cargo install foobar&quot;, no word about how to build the library without Cargo, the dependencies are only specified in Cargo metadata files etc.<p>Rust has the ability to build libraries without cargo. You can do it today. Cargo is a package manager, not a full-fledged build system.<p>When it comes to dependencies, note that Rust specifies dependency information <i>in the crate itself</i>, so it is independent of cargo. This is by design.<p>> Plus as I said package managers encourage developers to write software with lots of dependencies .. which becomes a pain to build without said package manager.<p><i>Software has dependencies.</i> Our answer to dependencies cannot be &quot;don&#x27;t have dependencies&quot;, as you think it should be. That is trying to wish away a problem instead of solving it, and would be far worse for language adoption. Maybe as a Windows game developer that may be a scalable solution, but for server software (HTTP, routing), browsers (images, 2D rendering, font stuff), scientific software (LAPACK), it just isn&#x27;t realistic.<p>> While in theory Cargo may be optional, I doubt it will be in practice. The whole Rust ecosystem will grow based on the assumption that everyone uses Cargo, and everyone who does not will be in for a world of pain. Other languages who have official package managers show this.<p>Most languages with package managers (really, most languages period) are languages that run on a VM and don&#x27;t produce native binaries, so you&#x27;re probably running them from the command line or using a language-specific IDE to begin with. Because of that, installing packages from the package manager is scarcely more effort than using the language to begin with, and so everyone uses the package manager. In a language in which a large portion of people are using Visual Studio and using the language package manager was too much of a hassle, I suspect library developers would not hardwire cargo into their libraries.<p>(Not that I think it&#x27;s really possible to &quot;hardwire cargo&quot; or make a &quot;world of pain&quot; for users who don&#x27;t use it. All cargo does is automate finding and installing libraries. You can always do it manually. cargo is an independent tool that does nothing but read metadata and invoke the Rust compiler; it is not integrated into the toolchain.)<p>> Yes. See above for the reasons why. When I build my C++ software on Linux I do not need a special &quot;C++ package manager&quot;. I just apt-get the dependencies (e.g. SDL). Does Rust really need something more? As I said, I think a language specific package manager will undermine Rust&#x27;s ability to be a general C++ replacement.<p>We can&#x27;t rely on OS package managers to package Rust for a good developer experience.<p>* First of all, it&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem: the OS package managers are slow to update, and they don&#x27;t have much of a motivation to update without Rust uptake. But without a good package management system, Rust will have a hard time getting that uptake to begin with. Look at the situation now: Rust has been around for a while and OS package managers have little support for it. We have to take the situation into our own hands.<p>* Some OS package managers (most notably Homebrew) do not like language-specific packages as a matter of policy, other than for C and C++; they prefer that languages have their own package managers.<p>* Many developers prefer faster development than OS package managers allow for. We live in the age of GitHub, and the dead simple &quot;push your libraries to a server for the world to use&quot; has been extremely important for communities like Node.<p>* For servers, it&#x27;s very important that your production machine be able to replicate the development environment precisely. This is why you need a system that can tie your software to the <i>exact</i> versions of your dependencies.<p>> I did not mean to insult anyone. I want Rust to succeed, that is my only agenda here. I think you are on the wrong track with this and thus I wanted to warn you about it. Maybe I am completely wrong, we will see. I will not bother you again, because as a Windows game developer Rust is dead to me now.<p>Because we have a feature that you don&#x27;t have to use to use the language or libraries, Rust is dead to you? I have no idea how that makes any logical sense. <i>Having a Rust package manager does not preclude good Visual Studio support.</i><p>> Maybe I will look at it again once I read about the first major game written in Rust being released, which will probably be somewhere between 5 years from now and never. But right now my money is on never.<p>We are not just targeting Windows game developers. If having features that you aren&#x27;t going to use and don&#x27;t have to use is going to be a blocker for adopting it, I think that&#x27;s irrational, but I can&#x27;t do anything about it.<p>So far most if not all of the games in Rust are using SDL as a layer over Direct3D, because they don&#x27;t want to be Windows-only. That&#x27;s a dependency right there. Fetching and installing the latest version of rust-sdl is a real pain, and having a way to automate that can only help adoption.",1395171042

They always end up going back to the JVM.<p>Aside from terrific performance, the JVM gives you the best concurrency platform out there (though not the easiest to use), cool and extremely useful capabilities like dynamic linking and bytecode instrumentation, and unparalleled monitoring and profiling tools. It&#x27;s the most professional platform you can choose (unless you&#x27;re limited to Windows, in which case .Net is also an option). It&#x27;s so far ahead than anything else out there, that the competition can only beat it in very specific use cases (e.g. Go is much better at startup time as well as standalone packaging, and C has better performance, though mostly in single-threaded programs). But nothing else gives you the whole package of performance, flexibility, maturity and monitoring.",1395170695

Part of the problem was that two days earlier, another man in the department was fired over something having to do with an inappropriate relationship to a woman. The entire department was walking on eggshells. I felt it was just extremely bad timing. Another part of the problem is that I had an entry level job and he was very high in the department. So we had very little opportunity to work together, thus it would read as &quot;social relationship&quot; -- again, two days after another man was fired for his behavior towards women.<p>There were other factors. I plan to go into more details in future articles. In this case, I just wanted to talk about the fact that the glass walls of the stairwell fostered a sense of conversational privacy with zero fear of sexual or romantic intimacy occurring. You need conversational privacy to establish trust and do business. But you need a lot more than conversational privacy to pursue romance or sex. The lack of visual privacy mattered to our comfort levels. This man became someone who trusted me and likely would have done a lot for my career had I stayed with the company. That opportunity to talk freely (in the stairwell) without fear that one of us might misinterpret or misbehave was a key moment in the establishment of that trust.",1395170674

7424335,comment,7422293,7423952,1,0,bad_user,,,"First of all no interviewing method is perfect, short of working with the guy for about 2 months, unfortunately people are harder to fire. The algorithmic question you do fail at an interview is almost never the only reason for rejection (maybe the interviewer didn&#x27;t like talking with you, maybe you&#x27;ve got some red flags on your resume, maybe he saw some samples from your GitHub account and didn&#x27;t like your style, maybe he doesn&#x27;t like your blog, maybe he&#x27;s being a dick and you&#x27;re better off without them, etc...) - plus if you interviewed at placed like Google, it&#x27;s not the questions per se that makes the interview difficult, but rather the fact that they don&#x27;t give a shit about losing potentially good candidates, because they can afford to.<p>The tests I was giving involved 3 problems that were meant to be solved in 60 minutes, in front of a laptop using whatever language the developer wanted to use (I hate whiteboards myself). The interesting thing about my approach is that all 3 problems were almost impossible to solve in 60 minutes, unless the candidate had experience with algorithmic coding contests (in which case it was a question mark btw). And so I didn&#x27;t expect all 3 problems to be solved for a successful interview.<p>1. the first problem placed in the set was always the hardest to solve. This problem didn&#x27;t involve knowing specific algorithms and ideally it would be something that could be solved by brute force - it&#x27;s very hard to come up with problems with this requirement btw. I had candidates choke on the first problem, trying to solve it within the big-O constraints, while ignoring everything else. This wasn&#x27;t necessarily bad - one time I had this guy that approached a good solution to an otherwise very hard problem (too hard for a time-constrained interview in fact, it was an accident - advice for the wise, always solve those problems by yourself within the time constraints, before giving them to candidates). He failed to even touch the other two problems, but I liked his idea so I considered him OK. However, choking on this problem with nothing to show and failing to do anything about the other two problems was a red flag.<p>2. one of the problems was hand-picked to be easy enough to be solved by everybody, in a short amount of time - preferably containing the possibility of a one-off error or things like that. I never placed this as the first problem in the set of 3 - pragmatic developers that know how to <i>prioritize</i> their tasks, would first read all 3 problems before picking one to solve and this problem was a no brainer, while many developers tend to be hooked on the first problem failing to see there&#x27;s another apple that&#x27;s easier to pick (in the context of a time-constrained contest were all 3 problems are allegedly scored equally). Also, for some people I also got a hint of an ego problem - seeing that they fail to solve a hard problem, some of them gave up before the time was up, without looking at the others. Personally I don&#x27;t like ego problems. Also mistakes in solving this problem were considered a red flag - for example, I expect everybody to be able to reverse an array in place on a laptop on which they can test, without any mistakes.<p>3. The third problem usually involved an implementation of a basic data-structure, like a HashMap. I think well rounded developers should know the data-structures they work with daily. Or maybe something else that&#x27;s common, like something involving parsing. Mistakes in implementing this fully were tolerated, I only wanted to see that the developer could do it if he wanted to. Again, I never expected people to be able to solve all 3 perfectly in 60 minutes, otherwise I&#x27;d start wondering - WTF is this guy doing all day?<p>I could go on, but the truth is judgement was also handled on a case by case basis - I was actually trying to understand what the developer thought of while solving the problem, even though the solution was not correct or broken.",1395170591

From what I&#x27;ve seen, lower end datacenters, for example, he.net, often have &quot;free remote hands&quot;  -  their techs are expected to access your servers.   If you go higher end  to coresite or equinix?  the only people in the building are security. (and /maybe/ a power/hvac person)   And while they can get into your stuff (the locks on the racks are a joke)  they aren&#x27;t expected to do so;  a security person will get fired for jimmying with your stuff.<p>As an aside, from what I&#x27;ve seen, he.net has pretty good access control;  they check your ID, and then they take a picture of you, and the login system shows the person who is letting you in a picture of you from the last three times you entered.  I don&#x27;t know how strongly they authenticate remote hands requests.   He.net also prevents &quot;tailgating&quot; more effectively than most of the other area datacenters.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, even within coresite, all the local coresite locations have a fingerprint reader + radio access card access control combo, but at 55 S. market?  they don&#x27;t even try to stop tailgaters, as long as one of you has a badge.   at 2972 stender?  they put some effort into it, though they aren&#x27;t as effective as he.net.<p>I think that he.net is more effective at preventing tailgaters precisely because the user doesn&#x27;t get an access card.  You have to ask one of the he.net security folks to open the door for you every time you leave the datacenter floor, which presents a reasonably non-confrontational way for them to verify everyone has been verified.<p>At 2972 stender, they are very apologetic, but they do usually stop you.  I have, however, seen people get through without verification during busy times.      (the &#x27;man-trap&#x27; system is imperfectly enforced, in part because it would clog the place up otherwise.)<p>Of course, these comments are mostly about physical security, and the article was about getting unauthorized remote hands.

7424214,comment,7421652,7421652,10,0,EvanYou,,,"Author of Vue.js here, I&#x27;m glad you included Vue in your framework comparisons. Here&#x27;s some thoughts regarding your comments on Vue.js: the reason Vue chose to use ES5-only features is that it enables Vue to provide plain POJO syntax without having to resort to dirty checking or virtual DOM diffing. Granted the auto-magical POJO syntax is a somewhat leaky abstraction, but I&#x27;d argue that not all leaky abstractions are bad (since by definition any non-trivial abstractions are leaky) - it all depends on its leakiness vs. the benefits provided by the abstraction. TCP is the canonical example of a leaky abstraction in Spolsky&#x27;s original post yet it has been the foundation of everything we build on the web all along. In fact, even the concept of virtual DOM is a leaky abstraction in itself. My point is, I don&#x27;t think the leaky abstraction argument raises anything inherently problematic about Vue.js.<p>That said, I really like the project because I&#x27;m also a big fan of simplicity. Curious to see if there will be a TodoMVC implementation with Mithril for easier horizontal comparisons of actual code.",1395169520

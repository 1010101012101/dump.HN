Leo runs a media company and many people follow him to keep tabs on what he is doing.  It is not a personal relationship.  He doesn't answer a large percentage of his audience so there is no true conversation.  Most people probably thought he was on vacation or something.  They were probably listening to others or talking to the people they actually have real ""engagement"" (oh, how I hate that term) with.  Dunbar's number seems to be in affect.<p>The funny part is that many people with high follower counts crowd source answers instead of doing research, but don't balance that with answering questions themselves.",1282582752

The interstate & highway systems were not designed for commuters and should not be used for them. While I think computer-driven cars will be a boon to the environment and economy, the capital investment needed is pretty fantastic, which is going to be some decades off.<p>In fact, a real solution to this problem that could be applied in the design of our current urban landscape would be a multi-pronged effort to spread out the commuter traffic. Alternating work and school hours could widen commuting hours and distribute load across all commuter infrastructure. Increased levels of telecommuting would also contribute to this. This would be a sort of supply-side fix to commuter congestion. Local or regional governments could create incentives to encourage these changes.",1282582445

Of course, I would love a perpetual motion machine as it would solve all these pesky problems of energy, but the fact is that the way things are, right now in this universe, it simply isn't possible.<p>I firmly believe that radical life extension will be possible, but sooner or later you will have to die be it through freak accident, decay or by choice. You will die. I would love to spend entire lifetimes making things, but I can't and the sooner I realize that the better I can make do with what I have.<p>I respect Mr. Kurzweil like anything, but going his way is like buying a lottery ticket to fund your startup. You can make rational arguments about it and claim that it is indeed possible, but in all practicality it ain't gonna happen.<p>This is why I've decided to accept it and move on. I am going to die?<p>Fine.<p>I might as well make the most of what I have. You know as this has started to sink in I've realized just how petty most people are. They fight, they scream, they judge, they mock, they kill all in the hope of not seeing the emptiness. We fill ourselves with mindless chatter, some chatter is better than others, hoping to erase the fears, but the truth is that as long as we live in this state of being we are addicts and there is nothing we can do about it. It is only when you come to terms with your monsters can you conquer them.<p>Right now, my parents are spending time like they do everyday for hours at end watching a really, really bad Indian soap on TV. I can't judge them and neither should you, but can you imagine what a precious chance they have wasted and waste continuously everyday for 3-4 hours? Or, 30 hours+ a week? They spend most of their time afraid of judgement from society and they are too scared to be themselves in front of others. What existence is that?<p>I wish I could help them, but I can't as I am too small and they have ""wisdom of years of experience"". You see, if they realized and saw the world for what it was not how they wanted it to be, then they would have opened themselves to peace. They worship invisible beings in the sky in hope of securing favors, instead. I don't want to end up like them.<p>This is why I would rather stand and face my fears than hide.<p>I have decided to spend every moment I have loving other people, and making their lives richer. I've decided to make others smile and create beautiful things. I've decided to learn as much as I can about this amazingly beautiful world before I die. I've learnt that happiness is only real when shared. I can do this only if I am at peace and I accept that problems will always exist around me.

In high school I built a program called the B3D Tweak Utility, an editor for the Blitz3D file format (a RAD game tool). I sold maybe 30 or so copies for $20.<p>Encouraged that I could sell something online and see a return, I followed it up a crazy GUI build tool with Python scripting that supported a ton of extensions for eg building the demo and full versions of a product up to the install file. Completely scratching my own itch, and it took a few months of work.<p>I got zero sales. I posted on my usual dev forums with about two replies. The only email I ever got about it was asking whether I was planning a Mac version, which he'd absolutely need before he'd consider using it.<p>Thinking now about how much money I could make if I worked that hard on something for 2 months today makes me ill... but I'm not sure there are any short cuts around making those painful mistakes in the beginning.

We had a peak-hour problem where cars would flood the entry ramps, but struggle to merge with the existing freeway traffic - this caused people to brake/slow down which resulted in major jams.<p>To alleviate this issue ""there are traffic lights at some freeway entrances to control the flow of vehicles onto the freeway when the traffic is heavy.  When operating, the lights will change quickly, so that when the light is green only one vehicle in each lane will be able to enter the freeway."" (taken from VicRoads website)<p>The lights basically cycle from red to green every 2 seconds. That's enough to regulate the flow onto the freeway and minmises jams on the entry ramp and at the merge point between the freeway and entry ramp.",1282582277

1627230,comment,1625184,1627065,0,0,10ren,,,"I think swombat was definitely rude in his first comment calling it a ""fart"" and ""trash"". Name-calling is labeling, and is neither accurate nor helpful in a cognitive sense; and is abusive and disrespectful in a social sense; and it appears to be based on a strong personal emotion of anger, rather than an objective appraisal. It has no place in a civil and intellectual forum. But this is the internet. It's never been a civil and intellectual forum, including  here, despite what many HN users would like. Even associate professors, when online, do it: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1611007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1611007</a><p>The best we can do is to seek the grain of truth in what someone says, because they often do have <i>a</i> point, disregard the rest, and not fall into name-calling ourselves. It's just about impossible to stop someone from being rude; but we can stop ourselves from taking it personally. And the most effective way to do that is to fully accept any <i>legitimate</i> criticism they have, and totally discard the rest. The rudeness belongs to them, not to you, and you can bet it causes them all sorts of problem. One should  therefore feel sympathy for person who has been rude (including oneself.)<p>That said, let me unpack what (I think) was meant: by ""brain fart"", he's upset about the writing itself, and that the ideas have not been thought out carefully. He sees it as carelessness, and is offended. Whereas I see it as a lack of ability, with English not being the authors' first language. But I agree that you and the other authors can improve on this - as he said ""you can do better than this"".<p>By ""link-bait trash"", I think he means that you have written this article  for the purpose of getting hits, and not <i>primarily</i> out of interest in the content, nor for a wish to communicate it. From the article, and what you've said here, it does come across that way - but I find it very hard to judge, because of the language issue. Poor communication can lead to all sorts of problems!<p>He could have written these thoughts out objectively, without name-calling; as a result of not doing that, he has offended you. When a person feels attacked and offended, it is distracting for them, and makes it difficult for them to appreciate the actual content of the criticism (it even tends to pressure people to go against the criticism). Name-calling undermines one's purpose.<p>I hope the above makes it easier for you to accept the content, and disregard the insult.<p>You can begin by asking yourself what the purposes of the article were - was getting hits the primary purpose? It might not be ""entirely true"", but is it partly true? If so, admit it to yourself, and then you can move on. Having an objective and factual perspective makes you (largely) immune to insult.<p>(BTW: I have a more nuanced view of writing out algorithms. It's definitely useful at times, but it's not <i>always</i> the best one (not crucial or essential). A danger is that writing can concretize your conception of the problem (eg an incorrect assumption); whereas beginning to code can give you information. Have you ever gone to a lot of trouble to get clear on a problem, and then when you start to code it, you immediately realize that you misunderstood it, meaning that all that time was wasted? (and if you've become attached to that misunderstanding, you may fight the evidence, or not even see it, because not open to it). Writing algorithms definitely has its place, it's a mix.)",1282581954

I have not seen this in practice, though, and it might be a matter of the part of the world where I drive vs where other people drive.  But let's cut to the chase with how the system works:<p>You are not supposed to be driving slower.  You are supposed to be driving in average speed with the traffic.  You may have had to slow down in the first place to do this.  If you are just starting out, a good rule of thumb is to just leave space between you and the vehicle in front of you; keep pace.<p>The key is to maintain enough space between you and that vehicle that you can<p>(1) allow people to freely pass through (they are going to do something crazy to do it anyway if they do not have the space)<p>(2) absorb traffic waves<p>It is likely you will not be able to do #2 consistently.  But you can let off your gas and not hit the break.  Hitting the break is an instantaneous warning signal to people behind you, causing something of a reflex for them to also hit the brake.  You are trying to avoid the brake-light wave.  Letting off easy generally does not cause as much reaction.<p>What if you end up in a traffic jam anyway?  Leave space anyway.  It does help.<p>Aren't more accidents are caused by people getting panicky as they try to cross lanes of traffic that are closed to them?  They force their way in or speed up to get around a bunch of people?<p>It is all about leaving that space so they are comfortable.  Everything begins to move faster.  And you are more relaxed in your driving because you are not freaking out at what is going on in front of you, allowing you the freedom to react as necessary to all the other kinds of problems traffic can bring.<p>Intentionally driving slower over a long distance is a misapplication of the principles.  As the article points out, it is all about the average speeds.  Frankly, very rarely does anyone get ""pissed"", and all they do is pass around you.  And then they end up hitting their brakes and shifting out quickly.  Passing != bad thing; we are not trying to win a race here.  I have never been honked at.",1282581815

The problem being, in this case, finding a satisfactory way to switch people to an intrinsically superior way of doing things.  Simply forcing everyone to do it is not satisfactory, because the new way might very well not be superior (and because you'd be trampling on many people's rights, by definition of ""forcing"").  (Imagine what would happen if the government decided they were going to figure out once and for all which operating system was the best, and make everyone switch to it.  And then, halfway through the process, new and drastically improved versions of each of the operating systems come out, and now a different one is superior.)  Another alternative would have been ""prevent <i>any</i> keyboard layout from becoming widely used before ""we"" figure out which is best"", which is also unsatisfactory.<p>I don't believe in market failures, and I think Dvorak is superior and have been using it for a few years.<p>This doesn't contradict what you said, though, because, whether or not it would be a market failure, these people you mention certainly <i>think</i> it would be.",1282579388

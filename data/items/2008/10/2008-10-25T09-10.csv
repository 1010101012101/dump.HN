It would have been in 2003 or so, now I have one that's cheaper, lighter, smaller, faster, nicer screen, longer battery life, which is also a video player, phone, emailer and has 3d acceleration hardware.<p>What about the new Macbook's unibody construction? They couldn't mill cases out of solid aluminium in large quantities without CNC machines. They have been around for years, but presumably it's only a small number of years that it's been precise/cheap/available enough for Apple to use it profitably. I took a few laptops apart around 2000, there were lots of parts, widely spread out. Check the disassembly of the new Macbook - the mainboard is tiny. It's almost certainly largely built by very precise robots and designed with the help of a lot of computing power.<p>USB has gone from being a bit of a joke (in 2000 I had a USB Zip 100 drive) to being the file transfer and peripheral connection medium of choice with multi-Gb sticks for sale anywhere and everywhere.<p>Could you have bought a roomba in 2000 to sweep your floors for you? Or a friendly robotics Robomow? Or a games console with built in, low hassle, online ability? Or a BluRay player and a HD TV?<p>OK, my life as a day-to-day event is different because I work with and on computers using the internet, and that's where I can see the changes, but on a day to day basis it's much the same, the same sort of transport, food, books, consumables, etc.<p>Although I could now (had I the money) buy a car which would pre-arm the brakes if I was too close to the car in front so they will apply quicker, parallel park for me, alert me if there's someone in the blind spots, silence the carphone incoming calls when cornering hard as it would be too distracting to ring then. None of these things were around 10 years ago.<p>Nothing seems much different, but then most of my life is spent wearing woven thread, sitting on wood or plasticfoamy chairs, eating plants and being around brick buildings. At that level, how much change do you expect?",1224928533

You can <i>represent</i> the colors without negative colors, that's what you do with the XYZ basis they talk about. What the article claims is that you can't <i>replicate</i> all possible color stimuli in the physical world with three monochromatic bases.<p>I finally understood why high-quality ink jets have so many inks.

343467,comment,343062,343409,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"I have nearly 900 friends.  I wouldn't call myself a friend collector though.  The last 300 of these or so have all been initiated by the other party as I've moved and connected with different circles.  This does prompt an interesting thought exercise...<p>My facebook timeline:<p>-May 2004 College Friending (200 friends): I finish senior thesis.  Am bored.  Hear about facebook hitting Princeton.  I check it out.  It's cute.  I add my college friends.  Zuck friends me as an early adopter.  This probably gets me to 200 friends: the 40 or so people I considered friends, the 100 or so people I'd spent time with and then another 60 were people I knew through students groups, church or student government stuff. I believe at this point I had a detailed profile, was sharing my dorm room phone number and e-mail address.<p>-September 2004-August 2006 (200 friends): I worked as a summer camp counselor for three summers during time off from my first job, as a college admissions officer at Princeton.  Facebook opened to HS students so my campers and fellow counselors wanted to be friends.  It was at this time that I stopped sharing so much personal info, having begun to see FB as my personal address book, rather than an intimate conversation.  I probably added another 200 friends during this period.<p>-September 2006-March 2008 Grad School (200 friends):  I started at Northwestern J-school and we all friended eachother up on FB as an overture to getting to know one another.  Subsequent arriving groups of students also friended me.  It's not a huge program and networking is everything in journalism.  This was probably another 300 people, 60% of them are people I've worked with.  The rest are people I've had class with or corresponded with in some capacity.  Being able to get on the horn with a reporter at Time or Newsweek is just plain useful.<p>- Late adopter pickup (150 friends) - Over the last two years or so, as Facebook has become ubiquitous, people I knew in middle school and high school have surfaced to friend me.  Even a few from elementary school.  During a moment of absolute boredom, I tracked down my 6th grade crush on FB and friended her.  So FB became a bit of a link to my past.  Friending these people would prompt a short exchange of updates, followed by radio silence as we followed from afar.  It's fun to know I've got ooooold friends in places like Turkey and London.<p>- March 2008 - Present, Readers, local bloggers in Chicago (150 friends): The last phase of this has been recently as I've published an online magazine about Chicago news and politics.  Readers have friended me as have other bloggers and writers in Chicago.<p>At this point, while I share about 200 photos on my profile (none sketchy in the least) I haven't really updated it in years.  It lists my professional background and interests, and that's about it.  I don't go on there a whole lot, maybe once a week for 20 minutes or so.<p>That's how I have 900 friends, for what it's worth.",1224925973
343466,comment,342699,343336,0,0,iigs,,,"A few different possibilities:<p>Phase one: <a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=109902"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=1099...</a><p>Legacy form factor mules with advanced technology in them.<p>Phase two: Performance tuning shops often pick up early versions of cars to start testing, looking for saleable mods, and adapting their lines to the new products. I would expect we'd start seeing reflashes for systems within a few months of a vehicle release<p>Phase three: As platform N depreciates and platform N+1 goes into production, N-class cars start falling into the hands of people more willing to cut them open and hack (track/hobby cars). If N and N+1 run the same code (project/source level, not binaries), features could be committed by individual hackers and could be picked up by manufacturers as desired.<p>Of course this is all predicated on this release being a real, public, open source project. If their desire/intent is to create an open source platform so that 2-5 manufacturers can share IP, it's possible that we'll never see the infrastructure to flash things ourselves, in which case this is all a big fat stinky dead end. :/",1224925886

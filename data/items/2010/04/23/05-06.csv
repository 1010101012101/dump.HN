Unlike the EEE example, the context here is that the iPad is in short supply. So short that even the Apple store he was buying from had ran out of stock--as have most. The story he tells is about picking up one he had reserved several days earlier, and reserving yet another while he was there.<p>Now, from the retailer's perspective, this guy is taking the limited supply away from their actual customers. Even though a sale is a sale and they are making the same amount of money from it, they have no incentive to sell to <i>him</i> over anybody else in line. It's going to get sold anyway--and if you have to pick between selling it to an end consumer vs. selling it to a middle-man who is going to raise the price to your end consumer, you're probably going to chose the end consumer. It sucks if said middle-man was really just trying to do a favor for international buyers that can't get one any other way, but his purchasing behavior is indistinguishable from someone who is just profiteering.<p>If supply were adequate (as it is for EEEs, presumably) then they probably wouldn't have taken notice.",1272001772

The problem is that most people are coming from rails land (which is also where I'm from, btw) and over there, they have implemented ""REST"" as POST=create and PUT=update. This doesn't even really make sense in rails actually.<p>For a proper PUT request you have to specify the full body of the resource to be ""put."" It literally is supposed to be telling the server, ""hey, put this thing I'm giving you at this url."" For that to work you have to actually be delivering the thing, and in rails with PUT you are just submitting form data, which is a set of paramater name/value pairs (this is also what's going on with POST but in that case it's ok). This mistake derives mostly from the fact that rails works off of forms, and form data is always passed in parameter pairs, so you are never passing a full resource to the server. I'm still not sure why they don't just do create and update with POST though.<p>Anyway yes, your API will work fine. You can define it any way you want, and you don't even have to stick to the original intention of the HTTP verbs. It's just that to me, create should be idempotent in the case of creating zones and records, so why not use the idempotent http verb?<p>I highly recommend this: <a href=""http://jcalcote.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/put-or-post-the-rest-of-the-story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jcalcote.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/put-or-post-the-res...</a>\nand this: <a href=""http://www.elharo.com/blog/software-development/web-development/2005/12/08/post-vs-put/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elharo.com/blog/software-development/web-developm...</a>",1272001387

If you have substantial code changes and you screw up the merge during 'svn up,' there's little record of your pre-update code.  In the case that you accidentally select the trunk version of a changed file for the merge, your own recent code may be overwritten.<p>With Git/Hg/etc, you are constantly committing your changes to the VCS.  And you commit before you merge your working copy with any changes pulled from the ""central"" repository.  If you screw up the merge, the DVCS has a record of your local work-in-progress code changes.<p>You could argue with SVN that any sufficiently large feature transaction should be done in a branch.  Then the merge back to trunk will be safe with the branch's commit history.  Pragmatically speaking, however, many people - especially small teams - end up doing all of their SVN-based development simply using 'svn up' and 'svn commit.'  I know I have.<p>The safety that comes with a detailed commit history, especially for day-to-day file merges, is one big advantage of DCVSs.",1288865704

Whether our climate modeling is accurate or not, we're basically so far down this rabbit hole that we'd be better off focusing our efforts elsewhere.  This TED talk explains it pretty well: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-122089912362687601#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-122089912362687601#</a>",1288865463

I spent 7 months at a startup and the 9-5 burnt me out, it's pretty sad. I can do 100 hours a week for myself, but 40-50 hours for someone else is impossible. I have no idea how my parents did it, because it fucking killed me.<p>I quit my job and took a trip to London. Best idea I've ever had. Keep working until you have a small cushion and then quit, take a 1 month vacation in a country much different than your own and just try to enjoy yourself. Meet new people, spend time hacking on stuff you enjoy, just do what makes you happy. A couple weeks in London gave me a fresh look on stuff, gave me a chance to 'grow up' a bit. I've been called 'mature for my age' since I was 10, but this really made me realize I know absolutely nothing.<p>I got back, went back to freelancing and playing with startup ideas/meeting new people locally in my spare time (90% of my days). I had so many new business ideas and markets I could approach for freelance work, I thought of a handful of products. I meet with people who are much smarter than myself and bounce ideas off of them - bullshitting with another entrepreneur over coffee can give you so much insight on markets, product ideas, etc.<p>I have a few things that make me happy: friends, making my own money, and building cool shit. I've accomplished the first two, and working on that last part at the moment. I still live at home and my next big step in life is moving out, not sure if it will make me happy but I think it's a big step in the 'growing up' epiphany I had.<p>I can't comment on college, but for a few weeks last year I felt I might be missing out on something seeing my friends' facebook pictures of them at their new school. I thought about going to school for a 'real' non-tech degree, something simple like a pharmacist assistant (<$2k for whole course and a guaranteed job) but that phase passed. The whole situation reminded me of how much I hated high school and how this is very much like an extension with all of the required courses. I like how free I am, I like working stupid hours on stuff that makes me happy (or money - I've found they're kinda related in my case). I'm looking at drop-in college courses for things like iPhone app development, or an intro to web application development that they offer at a local technical college - being a marketing guy trying to find technical co-founders is a bitch, think I need to expand my brain and at least give development a shot. I need to throw myself into unfamiliar situations to grow, like last month when I had to talk in front of ~30 strangers at an event - simple for some, panic-attack inducing for others, but I pushed through it and felt better in the end.<p>You have to try something new, get out of your current situation for a bit. If anything you'll recharge your batteries and come back with a new point of view on things, or have a total epiphany and make a drastic change. Just try to do what makes you happy. My email/twitter are in my profile, my phone number is on my website, feel free to email/call me because we're both kinda going through the same thing. I have ideas I want to bounce off of people, and am always putting myself in a position to make new friends or find a co-founder for some project I think could work. This offer is open to anyone else in the HN community as well.",1288865423

S are in the wrong<p>2. the debate matters, i.e. if S wins, bad things will happen (e.g. creationism will be taught in schools as science)<p>3. the chatbot will suck up more time from S than T (e.g. because T people are more likely to recognise it as being a chatbot).<p>Note that each of these is likely to be true if another circumstance holds -- that S is composed of people on average less intelligent than T.<p>Finally, what a delicious irony it would be if an evolutionarily programmed chatbot was written that succeeded in wasting the time of creationists!",1288865157

There are many cases, especially after 2-3 levels of indentation, where 80 characters is an unreasonably narrow space.<p>Some people would say that after 2-3 levels of indentation you should be looking at refactoring your code.

1868297,comment,1866952,1868131,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"Let's be clear what you are talking about here: In section 10.6.2 of the 2007 ""Impacts, Adaption and Vulnerability"" IPCC report, someone put in an incorrect figure for glacier melting. That's one mistake, after years of scrutiny, in the IPCC report that talks about the impact of climate change, which is not even the report that shows climate change is real. To imply you think that undermines the case for climate change beggars belief.<p>Now, you're not wrong in saying that quoting the WWF in a scientific report seems to be a bit of a screw-up. It shouldn't have happened, and the reports need to be reviewed more carefully to stop it happening again — except careful review did find this mistake, it was corrected, and the rest of the report, all 976 pages, still stands.<p>Additionally, as I alluded to above, this is not the ""The Physical Science Basis"" of climate change report, which weighs in at 996 pages and no-one to my knowledge has found any mistakes even as bad as the glacier example.<p>You cannot disregard that particular IPCC report for one mistake; that would be absurd.<p>And even if the whole of the ""Impacts, Adaption and Vulnerability"" was hogwash, you still cannot claim climate change is not happening, as it is the ""The Physical Science Basis"" that gives (funnily enough) the scientific basis to climate change.<p>Bringing up the Himalayan glaciers shows a basic misunderstanding of the IPCC process, the scientific process and the magnitude of the error compared to the weight of scientific evidence for climate change. Please provide a peer-reviewed, or even non-peer reviewed, paper showing mistakes in the accepted literature and we'll talk.",1288864881

I&#x27;m still not even sure if this is the correct interpretation.<p>I thought it was perfectly clear. He was telling a funny story about how systems and technologies evolve, giving two examples of that (latter, the watch, former, the system&#x27;s airgap springing a leak), and furnishing an object lesson in the need for regular thorough audits to ensure that systems and controls thereof are still in place and still working the way that the owners <i>think</i> it&#x27;s working.<p>> A facility like the one he described should have had regular security audits to verify that no hard lines were placed where they should not be.<p>Exactly. In fact, I believe at the time he wrote this blog post, OP was an active auditor for BDO. In some of his other posts, he analyzes observations he made while auditing a variety of companies/organizations; unsurprisingly standards across the board are very poor. He would be the first to say that this sort of thing is what an audit should prevent and why audits are needed (although I&#x27;m not sure I agree with his venom against pentesting; which I see analogous to fuzzing).",1449273233

That requires cash to cover production, machines, warehousing, transportation (this is huge) and terms for your customers. Big box loves to pay in 60-90 days. Try that on for size when you are making pennies on the dollar.<p>Similar to many other categories, the bottled water industry is experiencing a transition into automated manufacturing. This is putting a ton of the mom and pop bottling businesses out. Its become too difficult for them to compete against 24/7 automated production lines that the big dogs are running. The margins continue to be driven further and further into bare minimum/cost threshold by the buyers as they leverage it to drive in customers(door busters). There is a ton of pressure here and its not letting up. The smaller guys can&#x27;t afford to put the cash up to secure the new hardware and are closing up shop left and right.<p>Costco sells bottled water at near break even as a door buster. This strategy is very similar to what you see in traditional grocery stores where Arrowhead or semi-generic brand is selling for $3.50 a case of 24 bottles.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - folks like Nestle, Fiji, Smart Water etc. all do well but there is serious cash invested in those efforts.

Dick ran the gamut of uppers, his 1965 Nebula-nominated novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch featured two distinct hallucinogens: Can-D and Chew-Z.

While in this shared-hallucination, users can leave behind their dismal existence and act out an idealized, “swell” version of life on Earth. P.P. Layouts, the company behind Perky Pat, is also the manufacturer of the “illegal” Can-D. P.P. gets some competition when Palmer Eldritch is rescued from a crash on Pluto and returns with an alien drug known as Chew-Z.

If they don&#x27;t have the original file for their logo, you are asking for one of two things: 1) Recreate their logo or 2) The impossible. If (1) my answer is no.

Not as in &quot;restore a backup from before we saved over it with a cropped version&quot; but literally <i>uncrop</i> a photo.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily blame these people or get angry with them. I blame CSI and other investigative shows where they &quot;enhance&quot; a blurry photo to 4k crystal-clear resolution and read the reflection off of a button of a guys&#x27; jeans to read the licence plate of his car.

The initiating chemical lesions in liver poisoning comprise covalent binding of a highly reactive product of PA metabolism to proteins; similar events are believed to occur in brain, where alterations in the antigenic profiles of cerebral proteins activate the microglia. β-Amyloid forms, and, like PA itself, induces nitric oxide synthase. Peroxynitrite modifies cerebral proteins by nitrating tyrosine residues, further challenging the microglia and exacerbating the amyloid cascade.

Most if not all Unix utilities have been updated to deal with resource forks, and they have been integrated into the Unix directory hierarchy by treating the actual file as a single level directory.<p>The fact that the resource fork is invisible by default is the most reasonable way I can think of.  Other options such as concatenating all the forks together or treating the file itself as a single level directory by default <i>would</i> actually break everything.<p>The solution that they found is to have this interpretation (the file is really a single-level directory) accessible, but make one fork (the data fork) the default &quot;bag of bytes&quot; for most of the Unix tools.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>   file  /tmp/Euclid/..namedfork/rsrc\n   /tmp/Euclid/..namedfork/rsrc: MS Windows icon resource\n</code></pre>\nWell, wrong answer, but correct access to the file.<p>That was a copy of a resource-fork based font I created by typing:<p><pre><code>    cp Euclid /tmp/\n</code></pre>\nThe `cp` command copied the resource fork just fine.  tar was also updated to handle resource forks and other metadata.  I know this because long ago I created `hfstar`[1] to do just that, because the tar that came with the OS hadn&#x27;t been updated yet.

Here is my advice and thoughts.<p>Companies, divisions and teams are inherently social and political. Communication is very important. Understanding other people&#x27;s perspectives, even if you disagree.  Keep your emotions in check.  Take the high road. Don&#x27;t assume malice when incompetence is a sufficient explanation. Go out of your way to help other people. It builds good karma that will pay you back. Get to know other people in the company. Talk to them and show interest in them.<p>Perception is king. The only thing that matters is other people&#x27;s perception of your you and your work.  That said, the best way to increase people&#x27;s perception you is to be a hard worker.  Manage the visibility of what you&#x27;re working on and look for visible things to do. When a department is being downsized, it&#x27;s the people who are perceived to be of high value that are retained.  Remember that you&#x27;re being watched, even when you think you aren&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t look at porn at work. Don&#x27;t be the last to arrive at work or the first to leave.<p>Knowledge should be your main goal at this point. Knowledge increases your value. Learn new technologies. Absorb as much as you can. Become the expert in niche technologies used by your team/company. It is your responsibility to make sure you understand what needs to be done. Don&#x27;t expect someone to explain it to you. Make an educated guess about what are the relevant for next year and learn those.  Code at home. Follow your interests.",1449271006

The larger point here is that even if you set up a network in the first place which is genuinely airgapped, as time passes and systems evolve there will be constant pressure from within and without to re-establish a network connection somewhere in order to make everyone&#x27;s lives easier and eventually, whether deliberate or inadvertent, a connection will be made (and of course, we know that the NSA has a variety of infiltration and exfiltration methods to get across air gaps, such as dropping flash drives and waiting for an insider to be foolish enough to bring it inside).<p>The article is not well written, and I personally had to parse it several times to figure out what he was trying to say.  I&#x27;m still not even sure if this is the correct interpretation.<p>> Believing that an air gap exists or will continue to exist indefinitely is hence setting yourself up for some unpleasant surprises in the future, and encourages weak security designs where the network/system is crunchy on the outside and all delicious and soft and gooey on the inside. (Which is more secure, to have your local WiFi set up with WPA or whatever and have employees telnet into servers, or just go Google-style and have fully encrypted end to end links without requiring any belief in security of the links?)<p>That depends on your physical security.  A facility like the one he described should have had regular security audits to verify that no hard lines were placed where they should not be.  All hard lines and ports should have been marked with identifying information.  Nobody should have been able to keep a line open for any significant period of time unless these processes broke down.",1449270491

Let&#x27;s say, you pay $5000 rent, another $200 a month for equipment like espresso machines,  around $600 for utilities, another $600 for supplies, then you need to sell, 6400/0.16 = 40,000 cups of coffee. That is around a thousand per day. Let&#x27;s relax the constraints and say, expenses are between $1000-$6400/month between 200-1000 coffee cups a day. That doesn&#x27;t seem like a very easy target to achieve.",1449270021

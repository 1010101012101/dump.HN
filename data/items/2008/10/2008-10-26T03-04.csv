It works great. The only hangup has been accepting international currencies (we're having to work with a different company for that).<p>The transaction fees are low, tooâ€“which actually makes a difference when you start getting a lot of subscribers.<p><a href=""http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/</a>

If it's the latter, then there's really no cross platform advantage.",1224993015
344032,comment,343549,343840,0,0,qqq,,,"This is hard to read because they specifically asked for a short line count, but it's not really very complicated. an if/else, a map, and a recursive call. Could maybe do the string manipulation more cleverly, but the obvious (assigning a new string to an index) is destructive in ruby.<p><pre><code>  h = {'a' => ['A', '@', '4'], 'b' => ['B'], 'c' => ['C']}
  def foo str, h, pos=0

The request took 50 seconds.<p>It returned a bunch of results as well and then did recursive calls for each of those, including ""kwamile"".  The time it took for each of these calls was under 300 ms.<p>I typed ""kwamile"" in the search field and pressed enter.  Took a long time but should have been immediate because this search was already conducted.<p>You should just implement the caching yourself.  That will improve things A LOT.",1224991826

344019,comment,343571,343773,0,0,DaniFong,,,"One thing that seems to be a net win in scientific programming as well as graphics programming is a method to view code that renders sub and subscripts and unicode characters (as in Fortress). This doesn't reduce the number of nodes required, but it does improve readability substantially. Since reading code is often harder than writing it, and since scientific and graphics code is ordinarily <i>extremely</i> hard to read, and improvement to readability helps.<p>Adding very powerful and general capabilities to syntax, as Fortress does, also reduces the number of nodes required, but I've yet to determine whether the added complexity is worth it.",1224991249

344008,comment,343435,343957,0,0,gamble,,,"Yes, the term 'dollar-cost averaging' tends to be overloaded. Strictly speaking, it refers to a strategy where you start with a lump sum and invest it in chunks over a period of time, rather than at once. Some people have extended the concept to periodic investments, like you might make in a 401k. In that case, there's really no reason to sit on your money rather than investing it as you go.",1224990581

I can change anything I want in this one.<p>> I'm not deeply committed to the current approach to iteration. But I don't want to switch to something more complicated till I can prove it's a net win.<p>Paul, this doesn't sound right. <i>Prove</i> that a given change is a net win? Since you obviously <i>can</i> change anything you want at any time, why not go ahead and add the features that seem like they might be worth trying out? See what your users do with them. If the changes/additions turn out to be duds, just rip them out in the next version and let a subset of users whine about it. After all, users will whine either way -- may as well take the path that benefits Arc the most, right?",1224990023

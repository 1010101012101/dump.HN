Am I doing it wrong? If you really can't, that seriously limits their power.<p>--<p>In Lua:<p><pre><code>  > function adder(x)\n      local v = x\n      function inc(y)\n          v = v + y\n          return v\n          end\n      return inc\n      end\n  >> >> >> >> >> >> >> > f = adder(3)\n  > =f(4)\n  7\n  > =f(4)\n  11\n  > =f(4)\n  15\n  >\n</code></pre>\nWorks fine.

I find it quite a bit more elegant overall, and I decided to just jump in and do my throwaway scripts in Lua and see how much of a difference that makes. If I like it enough to write a few small libraries along the way, everybody wins.<p>Lua has tail-call elimination, coroutines, closures, and lambdas. I'm pretty sure Python has none of these, except for (possibly) a limited form of coroutines. (The Python lambda is too crippled, its closures are broken.)

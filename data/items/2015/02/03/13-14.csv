Left Alt-Shift shortcut that switches the keyboard layout. Press it unknowingly and BAM - suddenly your diacritics don&#x27;t work anymore and Y/Z are swapped. Annoys the hell out of an Average User.<p>PS. I&#x27;m not saying that the layout was bad - just that there shouldn&#x27;t be a magic shortcut for a &quot;break my keyboard now!&quot; feature.",1422968819

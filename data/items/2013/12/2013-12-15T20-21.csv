We wanted New York, we wanted Los Angeles, we wanted anywhere but here.<p>Over the years that has changed.<p>You ask most people that work at Google the significance of the Googleplex and no one will ever tell you about the prominence, about how it used to the rolling valleys housed the SGI buildings.<p>But day in, day out, the buses flow. The cars flow. Once you&#x27;re on campus it&#x27;s a different world. Everyone&#x27;s busy, everyone has something important they&#x27;re insisting on doing.<p>The whole of Mountain View, and in turn the surrounding suburban sprawl has been turned into the tiny steams coursing into Oak Ridge.<p>The highways are jammed.

6910829,comment,6910166,6910524,4,0,rayiner,,,"> Most of the other measures are justified with the &quot;War on Terror&quot;, including the removal of habeas corpus, removal of the 4th amendment, gutting of the 1st amendment, removal of judicial review and oversight etc.<p>Your comment is utterly ungrounded in reality. The &quot;war on terror&quot; has had pretty much no specific effect on any of the civil rights you mentioned.<p>1) Habeas corpus: the most recent change to the law of habeas corpus was AEDPA in 1996. Despite having &quot;antiterrorism&quot; in its name, it&#x27;s largely addressed at preventing convicted criminals from abusing the habeas process through repeated frivolous habeas petitions and treating habeas essentially as a federal appeal from valid state court judgments. The &quot;terrorism&quot; provisions are distinct and don&#x27;t concern habeas corpus, but rather financing and immigration issues related to terrorism. The post-9/11 Supreme Court cases on habeas have strengthened habeas corpus, not weakened it. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boumediene_v._Bush\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boumediene_v._Bush</a>, and the predecessor cases Rasul v. Bush, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, and Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.<p>2) Removal of the 4th amendment: the 4th amendment is probably not at the apex of its vitality, but it&#x27;s on the upswing since 9/11. To the extent that it&#x27;s been diminished over the years, that largely happened in the 1970&#x27;s and the 1980&#x27;s as a byproduct of that era&#x27;s &quot;tough on crime&quot; movement. Even in the context of NSA spying, the legal basis for those programs are not rooted in anything post-9/11, but in the quite old third-party doctrine and this case from 1979 that created the data versus metadata distinction: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland</a>.<p>3) Gutting of the 1st amendment: the first amendment has simply never been stronger, and the U.S. continue to have among the strongest protections for free speech of any country in the world. Your comment about &quot;protestors now labeled as &#x27;low level terrorists,&#x27; and journalists detained under anti-terrorist legislation&quot; is factually incorrect. What protestors in the U.S. have been charged with a crime based purely on their political speech? Some FBI documents stating that Occupy protestors might be a vector for domestic terrorism isn&#x27;t a first amendment violation by any imaginable stretch of the imagination; to violate the first amendment, the &quot;label&quot; must have some legal significance, not simply be an expression of the opinion of someone in the government. Also, your question &quot;what do you think would happen to Greenwald&quot; if he traveled to the U.S. totally ignores the fact that the U.K. has historically had much weaker protections for free speech and journalism than the U.S.<p>> Yeah, to me that looks like civil rights pretty much gone<p>You seem to be mostly regurgitating the utterly uninformed conventional wisdom that permeates places like HN and Reddit.",1387141147

While Strand is probably among the few teachers who would never invite a following, he most certainly deserves one. If you read no other book on meditation, read this one. If you have other books on meditation, put them on the back shelf and read this one. If you have never meditated before and want a book to teach you how, read this one.

You think ADHD&#x27;s status as a disorder is up for debate.\n4. You think ADHD is just overdiagnosed, and not also dangerously underdiagnosed.<p>You may be suffering from ADHDDDD.<p>The best way to sort all of this confusion and controversy out is to educate people about what ADHD really is, with detailed information about individual cases [1]. Let&#x27;s focus on the people who are actually suffering, instead of all the people who are both inappropriately buying and selling the disease. Proper knowledge of the former would lead to a self-regulation of the latter. If people actually knew how ADHD really manifests, then we&#x27;d stop flinging and/or sullying this useful clinical label.<p>I have adult ADHD and am in my late twenties. I was an amazing student as a kid. I am a software engineer at Google. I have no problems with the law or with substance abuse. I do have lots of problems though.

My life is <i>fucking weird</i>. I just learned how to tie my shoes. I can&#x27;t eat without making a mess. I talk to myself to keep myself stimulated. I could go on and on. Most people can barely fathom some of these behaviors.<p>If what you or your loved ones are dealing with is not really fierce and bizarre, then you can dismiss your concerns about ADHD.

For that mode you don&#x27;t need a lower capture altitude selected if you are descending (or the opossite if you are climbing). So they set the go around altitude on the selector, this is done to be prepared in case of a go around and the altitude is given by the standart approach procedure you are performing.\nSo they are descending but the altitude selected is higher than them. Till this point there is nothing unusuall if you are flying a visual approach. Then they realize they are descending too slowly and they are high on the approach. This is not unusual nor dangerous. To loose that excess altitude they select the descend mode &quot;Level Change&quot;, this means that the plane is going to capture the selected altitude, if it&#x27;s higher it will apply power and climb, if it&#x27;s lower it will set the engines to iddle and descend.\nAs they had selected a higher altitude the plane set climb power and rised the attitude to climb. Not even this moment is dangerous, as I said it happens sometimes. They disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and begun to descend manually. As they had excess altitude the speed is was not a problem initially you change altitude for speed, and descend at a faster rate to reach the ideal glide slope. All this is a quite usuall procedure that we perform quite often when high on the glide. \nTheir mistake was that once they reached the desired visual glide path from above you need to apply a bit of power (around 50%N1 ) to reduce the descend and keep the speed. They correctly pulled the nose to follow the glide but forgot to apply power. Then the speed started to decrease slowly till it went too far down and they stalled into the ground.\nThe reply to the second question is that they disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle, but the flight director was still on and trying to go up. The flight director are two bars located at the center of the artificial horizont that tell you were you need to put the airplane symbol to flight the selected path. It helps quite a lot, because manual flying inside the clouds requires a lot of concentration on the basic positions of the artificial horizont,speed and heading. The flight director makes it much easier so you can concentrate in other tasks.\nIt&#x27;s recommended that when you are flying visually and ignoring the flight director, to disconnect it so it doesnt give you misleading indications. This happened to them, they were descending but the FD was telling them to climb (as it had been selected eith level change). This maybe disconcerted them when they reached te visual glide. But the biggest problem was their failure to apply power manuallyto the thrust levers.\nSorry for the wall of text, but I&#x27;m writing from my Iphon and I can&#x27;t make the intro work and separate the text in paragraphs.",1387140589

(I agree that the default font set on his website is all wrong, much too small, so I zoomed in with my browser to read his words.) The key claim in his abstract is important and deserves more attention. (The article title in submission to HN should have &quot;2007&quot; included, as this posts dates back that far.)<p>&quot;Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances.&quot;<p>The author&#x27;s take-home points are a list of good practices. He comments that much of the content of whole journals would disappear if authors and reviewers followed these practices.<p>&quot;1. Lots of distributions give you straight-ish lines on a log-log plot. True, a Gaussian or a Poisson won&#x27;t, but lots of other things will.<p>&quot;2. Abusing linear regression makes the baby Gauss cry.<p>&quot;3. Use maximum likelihood to estimate the scaling exponent. It&#x27;s fast! The formula is easy! Best of all, it works!<p>&quot;4. Use goodness of fit to estimate where the scaling region begins.<p>&quot;5. Use a goodness-of-fit test to check goodness of fit. In particular, if you&#x27;re looking at the goodness of fit of a distribution, use a statistic meant for distributions, not one for regression curves.<p>&quot;6. Use Vuong&#x27;s test to check alternatives, and be prepared for disappointment. Even if you&#x27;ve estimated the parameters of your parameters properly, and the fit is decent, you&#x27;re not done yet.<p>&quot;7. Ask yourself whether you really care. Maybe you don&#x27;t. A lot of the time, we think, all that&#x27;s genuine important is that the tail is heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether it decays linearly in the log of the variable (power law) or quadratically (log-normal) or something else.&quot;<p>Good stuff.

6910661,comment,6910402,6910402,1,0,spodek,,,"I find the history and philosophy of science fascinating, but reading essays like this one remind me why, when taking a class in college on the philosophy of physics, I decided I didn&#x27;t want to <i>interpret</i> other people&#x27;s results. I wanted to <i>find</i> and <i>create</i> results others could interpret if they wanted.<p>This essay reads to me like a reporter dramatizing things like a soap opera (see quote below). That&#x27;s fine for people who like dramatizations about people and for periodicals that like to sell copy. Personally I prefer to do experiments myself and learn about nature. Of course, we can&#x27;t experiment in everything, so sometimes we can only read others&#x27; results.<p>Still, I feel like the writer prioritizes showing off his writing style and creating conflict over describing nature and our understanding of it. For example:<p>> <i>Dawkins assembles genetics’ dry materials and abstract maths into a rich but orderly landscape through which he guides you with grace, charm, urbanity, and humour. He replicates in prose the process he describes. He gives agency to chemical chains, logic to confounding behaviour. He takes an impossibly complex idea and makes it almost impossible to misunderstand. He reveals the gene as not just the centre of the cell but the centre of all life, agency, and behaviour. By the time you’ve finished his book, or well before that, Dawkins has made of the tiny gene — this replicator, this strip of chemicals little more than an abstraction — a huge, relentlessly turning gearwheel of steel, its teeth driving smaller cogs to make all of life happen.</i><p>> <i>It’s a gorgeous story. Along with its beauty and other advantageous traits, it is amenable to maths and, at its core, wonderfully simple. It has inspired countless biologists and geneticists to plumb the gene’s wonders and do brilliant work. Unfortunately, say Wray, West-Eberhard and many others, the selfish-gene story is so focused on the gene’s singular role in natural selection that in an age when it’s ever more clear that evolution works in ways far more clever and complex than we realise, the selfish-gene model increasingly impoverishes both scientific and popular views of genetics and evolution. As both conceptual framework and metaphor, the selfish-gene has helped us see the gene as it revealed itself over the 20th century. But as a new age and new tools reveal a more complicated genome, the selfish-gene is blinding us.</i><p>Of course, my tastes are only my tastes and others might love this style of writing. It will certainly get more readers and foster more debate.",1387138594

Once you&#x27;re confident that the operation succeeded, you can swap them.<p>I haven&#x27;t had to do this for a long time, but as I recall, this is basically how svn does it. It works fine.<p>The problem with git is that it makes this <i>far</i> too easy and it works by <i>editing</i> existing repositories rather than creating new ones. So instead of once-in-a-blue-moon repository hacking to get rid of that password you accidentally committed, you get people rewriting history because they think the real history isn&#x27;t &quot;clean&quot;. I know a lot of people who routinely edit their local history before pushing changes to a shared repository because they don&#x27;t want other people to see their true &quot;dirty&quot; history. This is insane.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m confused about something, so maybe you could clear this up for me. I keep seeing assurances that 1) git does not actually destroy any data, and you can always recover if you screw up and 2) editing history is sometimes a vital necessity for cases like when you commit passwords. You yourself made these assurances in this comment. However, 1 and 2 are obviously mutually exclusive. If you can always recover then you can&#x27;t actually scrub the repository of accidentally committed passwords and the like. Which one is actually true?",1387138219

Programming probably involves the dopamine system in your brain - solving puzzles all the time, you get a rush for it, and so it&#x27;s reinforcing.<p>You sound better than me in that you are realizing this earlier than I did.  You have to be far more proactive though - make it a conscious habit to only work a set amount of time and force yourself to interact with strangers.  I think I had a nervous breakdown of sorts and finally quit - it&#x27;s been a year and I&#x27;m still shattered and my life is not fully repairable to some extent now because of where I am at in my life now.  I really fucked up.  Please don&#x27;t do the same!",1387137841

What I mean is that when I go swimming, I shouldn&#x27;t be thinking about work. When I&#x27;m at work, I shouldn&#x27;t be thinking about my next swim.<p>I&#x27;m far from qualified to opine on this topic, but it seems to me that the &quot;most meditative&quot; practice is to do whatever you&#x27;re doing well, with intent, and free of pollution from other influences, i.e. &quot;when I sleep, I sleep; when I eat, I eat&quot;.<p>The Deep (to me) is a lot like being in a coding flow, or that blissed-out feeling you get an hour or two into a long bike ride or a swim.",1387137768

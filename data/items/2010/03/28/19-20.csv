For-profit organizations like Google do not regularly fund\n     outside projects besides special programs like Summer of Code.  If\n     they want that sort of association, they will buy out the entity.\n  \n     2) You CCd a number of SIAI people in your email, making it very much\n     seem that we had made the decision to approach them as a group, when\n     no such thing ever happened.  This ruins our brand by association it\n     with requests for handouts from for-profit companies.  We value our\n     relationship with Google very much -- by jumping in with your\n     unplanned email, you make us look like beggars.  .\n  \n  The correct way of making your request would have been to send separate\n  requests to SIAI and Google as a personal request, not using SIAI's name\n  to make a request to Google without clearing it with us.</code></pre>",1269805505

1225095,comment,1224071,1224206,0,0,dkarl,,,"Code that falls in line with your expectations and caters to your mental toolkit is easy to understand.  It also helps when code works well with your existing programming environment.  I work with Java programmers and C++ programmers, and they both have ways of jumping quickly to class and method definitions, but the C++ programmers' way -- incremental search -- only works within a single file.  The Java programmers barely notice that they're hopping around in the filesystem like Q-bert.  The C++ programmers, working in emacs and vi, come to a grinding halt when they need to hop around to many different files in different directories, probably because they almost never need to do that.<p>(It may seem like the Java programmers simply use more capable tools, but most of them don't use incremental search at all, so they're much slower at finding something that they don't have a hop-to-X button for.  Why?  Because they get by fine without it, just like the C++ programmers get by without learning whatever emacs or vi extension would help them navigate Java-style source directory hierarchies.)<p>Obviously some kinds of tools and programmers will be more common than others, so one style can be empirically better than another yet be worse for a particular group of programmers.  There won't be one better way of writing code until everybody has the same expectations and the same tools.  I don't think we ever want to reach that kind of consensus.",1269805060

Once a particular version of a module is on the CDN at a particular location, it will never ever change, and URLs pointing to it will always point at that exact version.<p>""YUI feels more like someone took the ""Java"" in Javascript way too seriously.""<p>This is a common criticism of YUI 2, but have you tried YUI 3? Carlos Bueno's jQuery - YUI 3 Rosetta Stone is an excellent source for comparing common jQuery syntax and idioms with YUI 3.

The bucket slides up to the drink you choose, then the drink slides into the bucket upright and comes out through an opening. This machine serves glass bottles like Sobe and Starbucks which wouldn't be good to roll down the chutes as they could break. So I am sure this vending machine I'm referring can be use to serve this squared bottle design.",1269802964

Still, based on a 2000 hour year, $500K is a billing rate of $250/hr. That's not unusual for high-end IT consultants, but at that rate the client should be getting what they pay for, or terminating the agreement. The problem with this kind of story is that it's hard to know whether the issues are with the implementer or the client -- are the delays/overruns due to changing requirements, or poor delivery?",1269802836

Premiums are another word for savings/downpayments for some potential future payout.  Insurance is an appropriate word for credit default swaps - as it is insuring against the default on a given loan.<p>In this case, I have my doubts as to how significant the role CDS's played in the crisis in the first place given that after they were all netted out, the actual size of the market was nowhere near the initial scare numbers put out in the press.

To suggest that the choice was binary and that we could have either saved them or let the world descend into chaos as silly as it is untrue.<p>Instead we've created a system where bankers have gotten rewarded for taking outsized risks without fear of the downside and the supposed ""systemic"" risk has gotten even larger as those massive banks have become even larger.",1255682323

There is <i>nothing</i> specifically stated to back up the conclusion.  Give specific actions taken by Goldman and show why that exploted people.<p>Secondly, even if some groups within Goldman did do this, its a vast oversimplification to say ""Godlman Sachs Is Robbing Us Blind.""  I know, its hard to get very nuanced in an article like this, but at least state which divisions of Goldman did this.  A lot of groups in Goldman are not structuring products.  Some of them are facilitating trade of other companies, some are just buying and selling stock, some of them are doing economic research, etc...<p>An article like this is meant to provoke anger, and thats fine.  Without getting people really mad, nothing will ever change (I mean this in a broader context as well, not just with respect to Goldman).  If a large power financial institution is truly using dishonest methods to rob us, we should figure out what to do.  I just wish there was some reference to a cold hard fact, a link to further reading which wasn't just the article itself on the huffington post or <i>something</i> to allow people to make an informed decision.<p>Ah well.<p>Edit: Spelling, a few additions.",1255681974

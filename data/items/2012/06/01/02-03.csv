4051710,comment,4050988,4051416,28,0,cromwellian,,,"Maybe you shouldn't comment on GWT if you don't know anything about it. Pretty much everything you state about GWT is wrong.<p>1) GWT does not emulate synchronous APIs. That would incredibly expensive to do, requiring the implementation of continuation emulation or CPS transformation of the entire program.<p>2) GWT does not advocate ""shielding"" the developer from DOM or CSS. You are free to use the widgets, or not, just as you are free to use JS libraries with widgets, or not.  The purpose of GWT isn't to hide the browser.<p>3) Most GWT programmers know how to interface with JS. I have not encountered any non-trivial GWT app that does not contain at least some portion that makes calls to JS.<p>4) On Javascript evolution. Sorry, Javascript has moved glacially slow. What has moved fast is the HTML5 API bindings. When ES6 arrives and GWT doesn't support it, then you have a point.<p>5) GWT is open source. It doesn't matter how big the GWT team is, it only matters how big the community is.<p>6) GWT UIs don't ""crash the browser"". Google derives the majority of its revenue from AdWords and AdSense, which are GWT, and if they were crashing customer's browsers like you say, I'm pretty sure Google would be in trouble.<p>GWT is a compiler. You can write bad code, or you can write good code.  In 2009 I ported jQuery to GWT. The resulting code was smaller than jQuery, and faster than all other competing libraries at the time.

4051702,comment,4050988,4050988,45,0,jrockway,,,"This is the best ""Why I Left Google"" article I've read, and I really don't have any criticism for it.  Everything he says is true on some level, but things that look bad don't look as bad with some context.  So I hope to provide that in case you are thinking of working for Google but are pushed in the ""nah, maybe not"" direction because of articles like these.<p>First off, you have to remember that Google is a big company.  It's one of the world's most profitable, and there are quite a few employees.  This is not a startup.  This is not a world free of politics.  This is not a world where the execs will listen to all of your concerns.  (With that in mind, it is very easy to get their ear and voice your concerns.  It's just that they might not drop everything to do things the way you think they should be done.)  This is a publicly traded company with lots of stuff to do and processes that scale to a large number of employees.<p>But, that's not a horrible thing.  If you've worked at other big companies (or bigger companies), this place is like a dream world.  You know what other people are doing.  You can see their code.  You can see their processes running in production.  You can have internal mailing lists where you might accidentally say something that looks bad during discovery.  Every change you make to the codebase gets another developer saying, ""yes, this looks good"" before you commit.  Everywhere I've worked before, anything like these would have been immediately shut down.  Code reviews slow progress.  Mailing lists are a legal minefield.  Sharing code doesn't allow the correct cost center to pay for its development.  That's how it is.  If you are unhappy with Google's corporate policies, try working for Bank of America.  You will not complain as much :)<p>On the other hand, if you are the ""I want to work by myself and be a product manager, engineer, sysadmin, and CEO"", then the big-company culture is not for you.  I write code and talk about writing code.  That's it, someone else does everything else.  I like that, but if you don't, you won't like the big company lifestyle.<p>(So, with that in mind, I don't think Google is a good place for your first job out of school.  You will be annoyed with the M&M restocking policies, quit out of protest, and realize how horrible the real world is.  IMHO.)<p>Now on to some specific points:<p>Programming-related:<p><i>Pathological love for Java and anything resembling Java.</i><p>This is a network effect.  In any project I've started, I've been able to use any language I've wanted to.  Plenty of projects are using Haskell, my personal favorite app programming language.  The reason why I choose Python or Java at Google is because I want a large pool of people to get feedback from on code reviews, design reviews, at ""could you take a look at this"" time, and so on.  Everyone knows Java, and so I can be more productive at Google if I use Java.  I don't spend much time typing in code.  I do spend a lot of time working with other people.  I think Java is objectively a terrible programming language and I hate it conceptually, but the great internal community and great internal libraries make it quite usable.  (Read my HN history.  I am not kind about Java.  But at Google, the limitations I complain about are not as relevant as they are when you are ""out on your own"".  I don't foresee any personal projects in Java any time soon, however.  It's too verbose for apps that don't need to be fast or scale.  And it's not really <i>fun</i> like Perl is.)<p>If you absolutely cannot work with Java, then there are plenty of C++ projects to work on and your skills will be valued highly.  Go is probably quite acceptable, too, given the right project.<p><i>Most engineers were not comfortable with {functional, concatenative, combinatory, logic, meta} programming.</i><p>Even though it's Google, programmers are at various different levels in their programming careers.  I personally like programming languages and their differences in style, but other people are more practical and just want to sit down and churn out features for their project.  They don't want to switch to Haskell because it's better at X than Java.  They just want to make something new.  So, if you want to be different, you need to be prepared to go out on your own.  And if you're new to Google, you might not be ready to do that for two or three years, because there is so much other stuff to do.  You're going to be thrown on a team and expected to contribute.  Establish rapport and then try to change the world.  Don't do it on your first day.  (Again, if that's a problem, big company life might not be for you.  This is a team effort, after all.)<p><i>Reviews preferred local simplicity over global simplicity; abstraction was discouraged.</i><p>The first half is true, simply because reviews are line-based rather than repository-based.  But there is a <i>design review</i> stage of projects when you discuss high-level design.  I was not used to writing design docs before writing code before working at Google, but now that I'm used to it, I like it a lot.  It's saved me a lot of time, I think.<p>Code reviews depend on your teams' conventions.  My team is super strict and nit-picky, but others will almost rubber-stamp changelists.  Different personalities, different results.  If you want harsher code reviews, review other code more harshly, I would say.<p>Abstraction is not discouraged.<p><i>Productivity was graded without much regard to the amount of technological debt accrued. (Though to be fair, this is a hard problem.)</i><p>I don't know much about this.  I work with lots of people that are at the level I would like to be at in a few years, and I don't foresee any problems for myself.  My bosses give me the impression that I choose good objectives and key results, and I pretty much meet all my key results.  But it's only my second quarter at Google, so who knows.<p>As for the corporate culture points, I basically agree with everything he says.  I don't think Google+ is the finest Google product the world has ever seen.  That's my opinion and since I don't work on the project, nobody really cares what I think.  I can live with that and even think it's reasonable.  But if you want to associate everything a company of 30,000 does with your personal thoughts and beliefs, you might be disappointed.<p>I know I sound like a total pushover when I say ""that's just how the world is and you should adapt yourself"", but honestly, I just want to receive large quantities of money in exchange for playing with computers, and Google gives that to me.  And really awesome food.  And wonderful coworkers.  So I can't complain much, especially after the other places I've worked.<p>YMMV.  Why not try Google out for a year or two and see for yourself?  You might like it, you might not, but you'll definitely learn something.<p>(And if you want to apply but don't have a contact at Google, I'm happy to be one.  Tell me about yourself and I will try to get you in touch with the right people.  jrockway AT google.com :)",1338519237

Sure, the CAPTCHA author gets to write code to generate their games, but you must not forget, the CAPTCHA attacker gets to write code too. If the author writes code to make the shoes any of 256 colors, the attacker gets to write whatever code they like to detect any of 256 colors and match them in code. If the author writes a trivia game with fixed answers, the attacker gets to hit the game until they get all the answers. If the author writes ""What is $randint + $randint?"", the attacker gets to write if ($question =~ /What is (\d?) \+ (\d?)/) { return $1 + $2 }, and so on.<p>If you look at it from an information theory perspective, the ability of the author to put information into their test is generally dwarfed by the ability of the attacker to put information into their cracker. When this is not the case, CAPTCHAs are uninteresting anyhow.

He says ""This uncertainty bothered me a lot, since I wasn't sure whether my project could be legally released as open source."". The normal open sourcing process takes about 3-7 days. If he really wanted certainty about releasing it as open source, he could have gone through that process and been done with it.\nThe process he is talking about is the process of Google granting ownership of various IP rights that google would normally own, to the employee. For various reasons (ethics, patents, copyright, etc) this is more complicated, and takes longer. Google is one of the few large companies that even lets you do this, AFAIK. The humorous part of all this is that the page describing the process, states quite clearly it will take about 2 months to make a decision. So it's not like the 2 month wait was unexpected, either, and phrasing it like he does implies that there was some amount of uncertainty in the time period where he was being strung along, which is simply not the case.""<p>In addition to the above, let me add that at least in the case that took two months, Spencer wasn't asking the committee about open sourcing. He asked ""If possible, I would like to own all IP (though Google can use it too, just not patent it) and possibly not release the results of this research to the open source community.""<p>This is the one that took 2 months to decide about.  He had said ""this is probably not related to what Google is doing"", and I explicitly warned him the <i>day he applied</i> that what he wanted to get a release for was in an area google did care about, and was doing research in.",1338518634

There's no way it can be the ""most successful ever"", for 3 reasons:<p>1) Windows 7 has that title covered, because people waited for something like it for 10 years, and were very frustrated with both XP and Vista. It also came at a time when there was still no competition in sight for Microsoft. There was a real, painful need for Windows 7. There is no such thing for Windows 8. Plus it arrives at a time when people just got Windows 7 and they are happy with it.<p>2) Windows 8 does a dramatic change over previous Windows versions, which means most users are much less likely to be interested in it because most users don't like change, and Windows 8 would have to follow the technology product life cycle all over again (innovators -> early adopters -> early majority, etc.). So it has to actually convince people to use Windows 8 over anything else out there, including Windows 7.<p>3) People are less likely now to be interested in a Windows machine. You have Macs which are getting increasingly more popular (at least in US). You have iPads and Android devices. You even have Ubuntu and Linux Mint which are starting to leak a bit into the mainstream.

Technically, I don't think there is any unsoundness in OOPs as compared to functional programming (or procedural or generic). Technically, there are paradigms available for all requirements. It might end up being messy or boring or bloated, but that is not a technical issue but more human. OO code on the other hand is incredibly easy to grasp and the ubiquity of OOP fuels itself. May be we would have been at a higher level in our enterprise codes if we had chosen a <i>superior</i> language like Haskell, Scheme or Python for everything; but we don't it for sure.

But that doesn't mean it's particularly usable as a ""better Java""; obviously reasonable people can disagree but personally I find it uncomfortable to write Scala code for too long. It feels like it leads to awkward structures (blocks within blocks within blocks, hard-to-follow but oh-so-functional transforms) and an odd sort of terseness that reminds me of Python (not a compliment, I find Python irritating to read even though I like a lot of the ways it does stuff). It's like there's so much <i>stuff</i> there that it encourages you to be way too clever. ""Too clever"" is a thing and a bad one; somebody (maybe even you) has to puzzle out your cleverness later.<p>I do find cases where the language actually does cause problems, though. There appears to be three main groups involved with Scala: PL academics, ""better Java"" people, and ""why isn't it Haskell?"" people. The last group is, to me, rather frustrating, because it's the group that gets up in arms at the idea of a 'for' statement in the language. (The standard method of iteration is a foreach method over a collection and it is <i>insanely slow</i>; people resort to writing while loops because the foreach construct is so laughably slow. <i>Why am I faking a for loop in such a ""modern"" language?</i>) There are a few areas like this where practicality has apparently lost out to zealotry and it makes the language feel vaguely hostile to somebody who already Does The Right Thing in Java (immutable-by-default, dependency injection rather than creation, etc. etc.). As silly as it may sound, when I'm writing Scala I don't feel welcome in my own code--and I've been using Scala off and on for a couple of years, it's not just fear of the unknown.<p>I'm actually really looking forward to Kotlin (and Ceylon, to a lesser extent) because it's a language with a focus. JetBrains knows where they want to go with it instead of just dumping a box of stuff on your lawn and telling you to piece together what might or might not actually be what you want.

4051540,comment,4049764,4051141,3,0,commandar,,,"I actually think W8 is ultimately going to be a disaster for Microsoft <i>because</i> it's so consumer-focused.<p>Microsoft has been a juggernaut for the past decade because of the enterprise. Part of the reason for this are technologies like Active Directory and Exchange built on top on the Windows stack. Another big part of it are enterprise applications that are also built on top of that stack.<p>Windows RT (aka Windows on ARM) doesn't support AD management. It's instead employing a self-service style portal that's meant to address bring-your-own-device situations rather than corporate device management.<p>Additionally, Windows RT will only run applications written targeting Windows Runtime; traditional W32 apps aren't supported.<p>So here's the thing: from a corporate IT perspective, what does Windows 8 give me that other devices like iPads or Android tablets don't if I'm going to give up full device management, especially if I'm trying to address the BYOD problem? (And from a corporate IT perspective, wanting to run line of business apps on iPads etc is probably <i>the most frequent</i> request I hear from end users).<p>From an ISV perspective, if I'm rewriting my app to target a new platform anyway, why not just go ahead and move as much as you can server side, present the UI as a webapp, and then be able to support all these non-Windows devices that users are clamoring for anyway?<p>W8 really feels like Microsoft painting themselves into a corner by chasing the consumer market while doing a poor job of addressing the market that's made the company what it is to date.",1338516439

This enables the stylus to transmit pressure levels as inaudible sounds, resulting in the ability to draw thin and thick lines.<p>The software was ok, but the biggest problem is still that typical stylus lag on iOS. Not much you can do about that due to iOS restrictions. It's early days for Collusion so i'm sure they'll come up with something.",1338516332

10727361,comment,10725707,10726983,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Historically, languages that have tried to move from automatic memory management to opt-in manual memory management haven&#x27;t had a lot of success in doing so. Java direct buffers don&#x27;t let you do anything more than simple flat heap allocations, and you can&#x27;t really get away from GC. D hasn&#x27;t been able to shed a practical dependency on the GC, despite years and years of work. There was some early work to try to use Go in places where GC isn&#x27;t acceptable, but in practice you can&#x27;t really avoid it. And so on.<p>Interestingly, the reverse is also true. C++ does not make very good managed language: despite the occasional claim to the contrary, the lack of memory safety and the library ecosystem mean you can&#x27;t just use shared_ptr &quot;for everything&quot; and forget about memory management in practice. Rust is also in a similar situation: borrowing is front and center, and the language doesn&#x27;t really try to make managed programming palatable: you have to explicitly clone reference counted pointers, and you need Cell/RefCell if you want to mutate their contents.<p>A lot of this has to do with the library ecosystem. Even if the language supports manual memory management, if the package ecosystem doesn&#x27;t you can&#x27;t really program with it in practice. I don&#x27;t know of any language (with one possible exception below) that has effectively subdivided its package landscape into managed and unmanaged ecosystems.<p>Objective-C is probably one of the few exceptions where you can really mix and match the two worlds. That&#x27;s because there are effectively two library ecosystems: the C/C++ ecosystem on one hand, and the native Objective-C system on the other. It&#x27;s a special case because Objective-C/Objective-C++ basically mashes two popular languages together while maintaining full compatibility with the existing C/C++ library landscape. I don&#x27;t know if you can replicate this without source-level C and C++ compatibility (which Swift drops).<p>The upshot of this, in my mind, is that assuming history repeats itself, multiple languages are probably going to thrive. There won&#x27;t be one language to rule them all, and large software stacks will mostly continue to consist of components written in multiple languages. Which is, of course, great for us compiler developers, and programming language innovation in general. :)",1450032796

But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.&quot;[1] -- T.S. Eliot from &#x27;Tradition and the Infividual Talent&#x27;<p>In this essay, Eliot uses the metaphor of chemistry to describe the poetic process. However, I think using the metaphor of the chemical process inside the ribosome is a better analogy. The poet&#x27;s mind takes a finite amount of emotions and feelings as there are a finite amount of condons which can be processed through a ribosome in an infinite number of ways to create all sorts of proteins [2] as the poet can move the reader to experience new feelings.<p>Whereas a computer can test if a new protein will bind to a cell or act in a certain way, the computer doesn&#x27;t have the ability to quantify if a reader is experiencing a new feeling or epiphany. Or perhaps, a person can be placed in a MRI machine so the computer can have a feed back loop.<p>A good example of the artistic process that T.S.Eliot described is how George Lucas, who has said in interviews that T.S.Eliot has influenced his work, stitched together several scenes from dog fights in WWII movies [3] using physical images of things that are familiar to the audience like planes and words, &quot;I got him,&quot; to create a new feeling for people to experience. Lucas and Eliot also had the same goal of using art to affect people into a spiritual experience.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t know how to English.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/eliot/tradition.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/eliot/traditi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfYf_rPWUdY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfYf_rPWUdY</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/1MjQ4My.gifv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/1MjQ4My.gifv</a>",1450032650

The main omissions are:<p>- Lack of &quot;word&quot; boundary detection (these languages don&#x27;t use spaces to separate words)\n- Lack of Pinyin translations\n- Lack of word frequency lists to prioritize flashcards by usefulness.<p>| 3. I was intrigued by the video player functionality, clicked the &quot;Find something to watch now&quot; on the features page. Clicked blindly. Arrived on a page of text in Spanish. Backed up. Realized that it was a mix of text articles and video articles. Scrolled down to a video article. Was very impressed with the player, but thought with a little less patience I may have missed it.

Rather, I believe that business school instills a number bad startup practices into the way that business students think, resulting in higher failure rates. Hopefully, by becoming aware of these &#x27;mistakes/traps&#x27;, business students who are founding a startup can save themselves time and energy which they need to keep momentum going.<p>2) I was writing with founders in mind who had not yet started up/were in the very first 2-3 months of working on their project. After 6 months (or maybe even earlier depending on traction), a lot of what I have written is no longer important/has successfully been navigated.<p>As a direct counter to your fourth option in point 2) --> if you don&#x27;t have a personal friend who trusts you enough to build your product, can&#x27;t pay someone to do it and haven&#x27;t proven that you can do the non-technical things (to a certain extend marketing and sales, but of course also other things), why would any technical founder work together with you?<p>I have met quite a few hopeless non-technical founders with pretty good ideas (perhaps with a few tweaks). I have to confess to considering building their idea, but not with the hopeless founder as a partner...",1450031748

10727267,comment,10722553,10726985,0,0,lubujackson,,,"Having run through a few startups (and dealt with some business school grads), I agree with the general premise because it is how most business schools train students to think.  There&#x27;s two types of business schools in general - ones that focus on forging middle managers (working with spreadsheets, managing employees, etc.) and some that focus on entrepreneurship (writing business plans, dealing with contracts, etc.)  Both are not very helpful in the early going, because the reality is that EARLY STAGE startups are only about one thing: validating a business.  A lot of the &quot;lean startup&quot; movement lessons apply: test your assumptions as quickly and cheaply as possible, spend as little money as possible, don&#x27;t work on things that don&#x27;t forward those goals.<p>My first business my partner and I felt like impostors the whole time because we weren&#x27;t raising millions of funding, we weren&#x27;t renting huge offices or blitzing marketing, we simply were working to make our business better and make money faster.  It&#x27;s the most obvious thing, but it tends to be forgotten when dreaming too big too fast, and having all these business school lessons to lean on tend to make things even worse because they only confuse the situation at the earliest stages.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these aren&#x27;t useful things to know, but first-time founders tend to lack awareness of where their company is in reality.  The best person to work on a startup is the guy who knows how to make a buck from nothing, the guy who fixed computers when he was 12 or paid kids to make things he sold on Etsy when he was in high school or whatever.  &quot;Doing&quot; gets harder and harder the more time you spend on &quot;how to do things right.&quot;",1450031724

Anything we can get data on, can be learned. Emotions and physical sensations are accessible for collection in example datasets.<p>ML is capable of detecting emotions in text, speech and human faces. In a similar way to learning to predict sentiment in reviews, we could learn to predict sentiment in photos and videos.<p>On the other hand, ML can learn a thought vector (meaning) for every concept and how they relate. So it can learn both emotion and meaning. Combining the two, it could make poetry. It can also compose music pretty convincingly and make a painting in the style of Van Gogh from a simple picture, or make completely original style combinations (example: <a href=""https://dreamscopeapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dreamscopeapp.com/</a>).<p>ML can&#x27;t reach human level in music and painting yet, and surely not in poetry, but it might one day even surpass us.

Without hooking into some kind of ontological basis it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to avoid this.<p>> As for the semantic web, every bio project I&#x27;ve seen which adopted the semantic web ultimately failed -- the semantic web seems like a great idea, but attempts to fully implement to the point where it&#x27;s useful for research always fail.<p>I&#x27;m aware of at least one group in the GA4GH that uses RDF internally, then converts into the custom schemas produced by the group in order to maintain compatibility with the top-down designs of the project. I believe this is the phenotype group. These are the people who are most interested what the author of the linked page is describing, they have decided to use the technology you believe is doomed to fail. But, they aren&#x27;t failing. As far as I can tell from their presentations they are one of two or three groups in the project that have produced a functioning system.<p>It&#x27;s very easy so say that hard things are impossible. This tends to keep them that way. I doubt we have any other viable option for building large distributed knowledge systems. The fact that these don&#x27;t exist does not mean they are impossible to construct, but simply that no one has managed to do so yet. People leveled the same kinds of arguments against neural networks up until a few years ago, saying that they were a nice idea but destined to fail because they were too hard.<p>> So I think they&#x27;re focusing on areas where they are likely to succeed (collection and processing of large amounts of raw and derived data using pretty conventional processes, but at a much larger scale, with a solid authentication and access mechanism).<p>The scales we&#x27;re talking about are not even an order of magnitude above that which existing techniques allow. So I agree that they will succeed insofar as they simply adopt these existing community-driven standards and slap access control on top. However, in terms of generating new data models for genomics, I&#x27;m not so convinced that the centralized design and API-based approach which they are taking will work.

I&#x27;m still working out how to deal with this.<p>One approach is to wait it out.  Stay with the trade rails view, add JavaScript as needed, see what I can get out of turbolinks and sockets in rails 5.<p>Another possibility is to go rails-api and write the front end in react or ember.  This of course requires going in heavily on JavaScript and (at least for now) duplicating a lot of effort in client and server code (models data routes ...)<p>Another is to say bye to ruby and go all in with node.  I don&#x27;t hate JavaScript but it felt great to go from java to ruby.  Doesn&#x27;t feel great going from ruby to JavaScript but that may change over time.<p>Another is to go rails api and try to carve out a role as a pure back end dev.  I enjoy back end work more anyway, and maybe specialization is inevitable.  It has certainly happened in other fields.<p>Lastly maybe the trend toward isomorphic development will continue and devs will have as wide a range of choices on the client as they have on the server.

Lets make the two scenarios more similar.<p>Say &quot;earth&quot; is a sphere with radius 1 meter and you&#x27;re 1 meter away. And that puny magnet defeats its gravitational pull in the same way it defeats earth. How heavy would our sphere have to be in order to have the same pull as earth if it has a radius of 1 meter and our magnet is 1 meter away?<p>If you remember Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation the force an object will feel looks like: F=Gm/r^2. G is small, 10^-11 Nm^2/kg^2, m is the mass of earth 10^24 kg, r is normally 10^6 m (the radius of the earth). Plug in these numbers you get 10 m/s^2. The real answer is closer to 9.8, but we&#x27;re looking for the order of magnitude here. We&#x27;re still remarkably close for how much rounding we did.<p>How lets say that we&#x27;re now 1 meter away. How heavy would the mass have to be to still pull with 10m/s^2, which we know our magnet can defeat. (10^6)^2 ~> 10^12 so we have to be 10^24/10^12 ~> 10^12 kg.<p>So to defeat a tiny magnet 1 meter away you need 10^12kg. Lets pretend our mass is a cube whose volume is 1m^3. That&#x27;s 10^12kg/m^3. The center of the sun has a density of 10^5kg/m^3. This is 10^7 times denser! We&#x27;re lucky that our sphere is far too light by many orders of magnitude to collapse into a black hole (maybe not so lucky because it&#x27;s going to explode immediately!) but it&#x27;s even denser than a white dwarf. This is on the order of the mass of Mt. Everest (this is a very rough and unprincipled comparison and when you unpack it can mean many different things, but it&#x27;s something easy to visualize).<p>So you can see. Gravity is indeed insanely weak. A magnet can defeat Mt. Everest.",1450031023

As far as I know, this is illegal in every jurisdiction that has an income tax, but it&#x27;s still a very common practice.

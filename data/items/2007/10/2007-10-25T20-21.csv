i would therefore say ""one moment in annihilations waste, one moment the well of life to taste"" and it is quoting Fitzgerald's translation of  Omar Kyham<p>",1193345447

Maybe if you thought they were less arbitrary, you'd make enough changes for them to be less malicious, too.",1193345201

72657,comment,45698,45698,0,0,haiku,,,"One aspect of this article that hasn't been mentioned is that this also points out one reason that big companies have a hard time keeping good people unless they have some way to let people do this kind of work.<p>Companies that allow interruptions or distractions that don't let employees get into ""flow"" or ""the zone"" and create/execute at their capacity are going to find that it's difficult to retain truly great employees because most great creators/makers are only happy when doing their best work - anything less is demeaning, insulting, boring and maddening.<p>The points made by other comments that some companies fear the gifted individual because that individual is not a cog that can be exchanged for others is correct - I've seen this fear before.  So what's the answer?  Have some of both kinds of coders?  Accept a loss of control and the associated risks?  Have an Advanced Technology Group (ATG, like apple once did) and let magic happen there and then toss it to the production group to put it into shippable products?  How do you keep the envy between those in the group and the rest of the engineers under control?  One thought was to have rotating positions in the group and you did some time in production and then you rotated into the ATG.  I like the sound of the Google 20%, but don't know how well it would work for me - I want a couple of weeks per idea to really get it to the prototype/proof-of-concept stage.  Then I can set it aside.<p>At another company, I had the software engineers in a separate building across town from the sales, marketing, support groups.  And everyone one who was not a programmer was directed to contact me and not to contact programmers directly unless the programmer had requested them to.  Not ideal in all ways, but it did help with many of these issues.<p>anyway, truly great post.  I sent it to the VP of engineering at my company because it explains my frustration with working there so well....<p>This topic is worth a book on how to run a software engineering company.  Take the insights from this blog, and then figure out a way to create a medium to large company work environment that supports what software engineers need to be truly productive and innovative.",1193344891

72652,comment,72317,72317,0,0,pfedor,,,"Based on my, admittedly quite limited, experience as an interviewer I think the author is mistaken. The type 5 questions, which he praises, are not very useful in practice. ""Tell me about your research"" is only good as a warm up question, to make the candidate feel a bit more comfortable before getting to the real questions. You can have very bad candidates that will nevertheless be able to reasonably discuss their research. It's the topcoder-type algorithm/coding questions that will give you a much better insight into the candidate's coding skills and analytical abilities.<p>So, if a company put emphasis on type 5 questions, it doesn't mean that they value ""thinkers"". It simply means that they're bad at interviewing.",1193344347

72650,comment,58025,58025,0,0,rodrigobraz,,,"Paul, what do you think of Modern Art, especially painting? It seems to me the very same arguments you made about philosophy hold there. People try to look impressive by doing something opaque and incomprehensible and calling it art. If you don't ""get it"" that is used as even further evidence as to their genius. It seems to me the same situation you talk about, when there is a market for people producing and consuming such things.<p>I would love to know your take on the subject.

Thus, for anyone to take up Lisp, they have to admit to themselves their past decisions were mistakes. It's a lot easier to say ""screw you, I'm right"" and not switch over. If Lisp is right, they wasted a lot of time and effort, so they are invested in it being wrong.<p>The same thing happens in other fields.",1193343484

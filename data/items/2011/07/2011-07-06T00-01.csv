There are simply structural impediments to employing people in low skill jobs.<p>One of the biggest impediments is competition from government benefits. To induce a person to work, an employer needs to offer them enough to compete with their next best alternative. At low wage levels (i.e., low skill labor), this is extremely difficult. Consumption as a function of earned income is actually flat up to about $20k/year.<p>Thus, it is economically rational for low skilled individuals to choose not to work, even if others are willing to pay for their labor.<p><a href=""http://crazybear.posterous.com/why-the-poor-dont-work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crazybear.posterous.com/why-the-poor-dont-work</a>",1309913554

If you need to zoom in 400-800x on some pixels to even be able to spot the differences, then in practical terms there are no differences. You can't expect your typical visitor to sit in front of the monitor with a magnifying glass sweating at your pixel perfect buttons. Honestly, no one is going to give it much more than a glance, so attention to detail you can hardly spot with the naked eye is almost completely pointless.<p>Now to come back to my main point: what isn't pointless is maintaining quality when zooming in with the browser. This is something I often do myself when I'm too lazy to put my contacts in to just casually browse the web. Just about every website looks like a mess of blurry/pixelated crap when you do that. Had he just went with the css3 approach, the quality at non standard zoom levels would far outweigh the minuscule pixel details at normal zoom levels between the css3 and photoshop versions.<p>Anyway, that's all I really wanted to say. Had the point been that CSS3 styling was still iffy with older browsers being around and the photoshop button was superior for that reason, I wouldn't have said anything. But to dismiss it based on some differences in pixelation you wouldn't even spot normally, while ignoring that if you had actually zoomed in the browser there would be no pixelation at all with the ""inferior"" css3 version, was just too much.",1309912958

And while, yes, ""idiomatic"" (read: terse and annoying) code is in use in all those areas, I don't have to see it.<p>Code should be pleasant to read wherever possible. That simply is not, to my mind, pleasant to read. It's one step away from Perl line noise (which I avoid, too). You may disagree with this, and that's fine--different strokes for different folks. I have no interest in seeing it in code I have to maintain; you might, and that's OK by me.<p>(To be fair, however, I have little interest in working with or, god forbid, maintaining C or C++ code under any circumstances. They press the buttons of a group of developers to which I don't belong.)",1309911762

He brought a NeXT computer (I have no idea which one), with some rectangular cartridge (must have been the magneto-optical media).  He explained why it was such a fantastic machine, and proceeded to spend the allotted 30 minutes attempting to boot it.<p>I have no idea who this guy was or what he did for a living, but it was my very first experience watching a demo go horribly wrong.  I have to say, that event influenced me in over-preparing for any sort of demo.  I don't remember the details, but I remembered that it was NeXT, and I remembered that it didn't boot.

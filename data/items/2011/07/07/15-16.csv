2738994,comment,2738884,2738884,1,0,ugh,,,"Im submitting this because I have been using Google+ with that same smile on my face. The interaction design is just so incredibly well done.<p>Here is one tiny example: How do you add someone as a friend (or rather to one of your circles) when you encounter them commenting somewhere?<p>Here is what you do in Facebook: You click on their name which takes you to their profile page and then you click the friend request button next to their name. A pop up opens where you have to click once again to send them the friend request. If you want to put them on a list before sending them the request you have to click another two times. Thats five clicks and one page reload.<p>Here is what you do in Google+: As soon as you hover over the name a tooltip with a larger profile photo and that persons current company or university appears (to help you make sure that youve got the right person). You can still go to their profile if you want to but there is also a big add button right there in the tooltip. As soon as you hover over that add button (you dont even have to click it) a list of your circles with checkboxes appears and you can check or uncheck however many you want. (This interface also allows you to remove someone from your circles or to put them in a different or in an additional circle, its really powerful.) Thats one click and no page reload.<p>Also, since its all happening around the profile name (the tooltip appears right next to it, the list of your circles replaces the big add button on the tooltip) everything is really close to each other. Its an interface that respects Fitts law. When you use Facebook you have to mouse all over the place to get things done, when you use Google+ you only need minimal mouse movement.<p>You really have to use it to experience the difference (and to get the smile on your face). Facebook feels clunky and slow, Google+ feels fluid and fast.<p>Its astonishing, really. Gmail, for example, is certainly solid work but its nothing like Google+. Google+ is a whole different level.<p>Edit: Arrrg, Im partially wrong. Facebook actually also has a tooltip. It shows up after a second or so (vs half a second at Google+). So that removes two steps and the reload. There is still this huge request pop up and its four clicks and no page reload.",1310054358
2738993,comment,2738883,2738883,12,0,bediger,,,"This is a rubbish article.  It confuses ""theft"" with ""infringement"".  Mostly, it calls the action of infringement an ""offense"", but at one point it calls it an ""infraction"",  The article fails to say who decides if an ""offense"" or ""infraction"" occurs.  Usually, conviction of a crime requires some kind of judicial activity, but other sources report that mere accusation of infringement is what counts as an ""infraction"".<p>This whole scheme is most un-American.  No presumption of innocence is made, no judicial review occurs, and there is no procedure in place to redress mistakes. The RIAA is a known un-American organization, seeking to undermine basic constitutional rights like Freedom of Speech, Freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, due process of law, and presumption of innocence.  I call upon the ISPs in question to stop performing un-American actions, and diassociate themselves from the nearly-fascist RIAA and MPAA.",1310054347

Apple claims infringement and dilution of its mark. To win on infringement, it must ultimately show that it has a legally protectable mark and that Amazon's use of the term ""app store"" to describe where it sells apps for use on Android devices will likely confuse consumers about the origin of the goods being sold. To win on dilution, it must show that the mark is protectable, that it is ""famous,"" and that Amazon's use of it dilutes its value.<p>To get a preliminary injunction, Apple needed to convince the judge that it is <i>likely</i> to win at trial and also that it will be irreparably harmed if Amazon is not blocked from using the mark during the time leading up to trial. The judge said no to the preliminary injunction, not on grounds of lack of irreparable harm (that issue was never reached) but on the ground that Apple was not likely to win on the merits of its claims at trial.<p>Marks are classified as generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful. Any mark that is suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful is protectable. A generic mark is never protectable and a descriptive mark normally is not either - but the latter can become protectable if it acquires distinctiveness in the public mind through what is called ""secondary meaning"" (which generally means that a company has advertised a product or service to such a degree that the public comes to associate the mark with the producer of the goods or services as opposed to seeing the mark as descriptive, e.g., ""Holiday Inn"").<p>Apple claimed that the ""app store"" mark is suggestive because its meaning is ""not inherently obvious"" and because Apple was required to devote a lot of resources to educate consumers about the service.<p>Amazon claimed the mark is generic in merely describing a store where software apps are sold.<p>On this key issue, the court ruled as follows in assessing whether Apple was likely to succeed with its claim: ""The court assumes without deciding that the 'App Store' mark is protectable as a descriptive mark that has arguably acquired secondary meaning. The court does not agree with Amazon that the mark is purely generic . . . but also does not find that Apple has shown that the mark is suggestive, as there appears to be no need for a leap of imagination to understand what the term means.""<p>So far so good for Apple (with its major advertising, it may well be able to prove secondary meaning at trial).<p>But Apple got sunk by the second factor it will need to show if it is to win at trial and that is the ""likelihood of confusion"" factor. On this point, the court weighed eight factors as required by governing precedent but, in effect, really boiled it down to the fact that consumers buying apps for Android devices will not really believe that they are buying them from Apple or from an Apple-authorized source when they see the term ""app store"" at Amazon's site.<p>The court also rejected Apple's dilution claim as a basis for granting preliminary relief, basically finding that ""App Store"" did not constitute a ""famous mark"" on the evidence shown by Apple to date (it is here that the generic references to ""app store"" by Mr. Jobs and others come back to bite Apple).<p>All this suggests that Apple will have an uphill fight at trial on this one (as it should, in my view).<p>The 18-page decision is well-reasoned and may be found here: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/59494852/Apple-v-Amazon-Order-Denying-Motion-for-Preliminary-Injunction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/59494852/Apple-v-Amazon-Order-Deny...</a>.

This is mainly in terms of startup. You have to include the Clojure runtime with any programs you write with it and this is a substantial overhead on Android. Your binaries will be larger as a result as well. This is because, Clojure as a Lisp, expects the entire language to present all the time. This usually is <i>the</i> killer feature (it's a large part of what makes macros and the dynamic coding associated with Lisp possible) but it's a pain when you have limited resources.<p>The other issue I ran into was that there were issues in getting Clojure to interact with Android properly. Android requires that you compile your code into classes which means you will have to use :genclass in Clojure and implement a lot of interfaces. This in itself isn't that much of a problem (it will make you code less Lispy but oh well) but when I tried it there were bugs in Clojure which made it impossible for me to do some things on Android that I would have liked. That part of the language runtime is a little immature in my experience.<p>I wouldn't give up based on my words though. It may have improved since I last tried.

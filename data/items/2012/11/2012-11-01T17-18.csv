4728788,comment,4726876,4727852,5,0,gregsq,,,"I'm afraid this doesn't work in all cases. When working in a reduced physical area, irrespective of pixel count, zooming in and snapping to boundaries is counter productive. Audio wave editing for example is an operation on cyclic ( obviously ) information, and when zooming in as a means of rationalising location, important context is lost.<p>Imagine a time line with a periodic wave, interrupted only by a one or two cycle click. Zooming in to normalise the ratio of object to finger leads to very easily losing context. That is, relative positioning left or right is lost. So it becomes frustrating zooming in and out in order to get your bearings again. Even attempting this on a trackpad is quite difficult, when compared to high resolution mice.<p>There are many cases where it's much better to have a large display area, combined with a high resolution mapping to that area. I could edit waves on a postage stamp sized display with my finger if I put my mind to it. I don't think I would be as productive as on a tablet sized display though. In other cases I need to increase yet above that ratio. I'm afraid stubby fingers on compensating scaled objects is not adequate always.",1351792531

I don't know that they're right -- I think their brand is strong enough to shake off Samsung, and they should take a page from the fashion industry, where brand is everything and copying is rampant, but nobody sues.  But that's how they see it.  Notice they're not suing Microsoft over the Surface?  I'd bet there's some patent somewhere that would apply.  Maybe there's some sort of understanding going on, but I seriously doubt it.  I think it's because the Surface is genuinely different.",1351791804

The most shocking thing I learned was that all those mission control consoles were not static systems.  Many (most?) of those consoles had major changes <i>during</i> each mission.  Today, of course, we would just update some software to change indicator light/display label as needed during a mission.

4728719,comment,4726724,4727086,1,0,mindslight,,,"I agree with your entire comment except for the first sentence. When working for a ideological goal, it is important to continually and earnestly evaluate what goals the imagined solution will actually fulfill, lest one end up misplacing faith in an implementation that can never achieve the desired ends.<p>First, this FPGA is <i>still</i> not implemented by things that are the lowest level - how do you know that 7404 doesn't actually contain secret logic looking for specific patterns on the 6 ""independent"" inputs (based on your widely-propagated design) that alter it's behavior?<p>Second, if one wanted to build an auditable CPU, they would not start by building auditable reconfigurable logic in order to develop a soft core CPU on top of it. This is a needless extra layer of interpretation, and the number one constraint you're trying to overcome is the constant factors that are left out of the Big-Oh notation.<p>We don't buy Intel processors because we're lazy and have money to burn, but because they contain a billion transistors switching a billion times a second. If you build something with 10k transistors switching at 10M Hz, something that would take 1 second on the modern CPU will take roughly 3 <i>months</i>.<p>So I think there's two properties to be achieved for actual Free Computing. The first is roughly getting something that can compute. These days, this can be done by buying a standard PC and installing your own software on it. This may not continue to be possible (so we would have to eg rely on integrating our own ARM chips, then FPGAs, then microcontrollers, etc), but trying to put a solution forward before it is necessary isn't going to get very far. There also is available computation that is unlikely to go away - Javascript in web browsers, available to all but sandboxed programming toy apps, etc.<p>Which brings us to the second quality of Free Computing, which is auditability - guaranteeing that the code running is doing what it says, rather than a subtle corruption which renders the whole sensitive algorithm broken. To get performance, we would like it if such a CPU could be made in a necessarily non-trusted fab, rather than independently assembled from discrete transistors. This seems like a harder, but yet better defined problem - meaning it might actually be possible to solve through some combination of clever proofs and bootstrapping trust up from an extremely simple auditable CPU.",1351791637

Nonetheless I am actively seeking charities who could benefit from these kinds of projects but so far - to my frustration - I have lots of encouragement and interest but no projects started. It actually hurts to admit that in a public forum, but I can't see the point in pretending otherwise. I have met up with local charity reps who love the idea, but I guess it takes time for something like this to gain traction when charities are already invested financially and emotionally in existing programmes of work, plus funding bids, plus tenders for service provision, not to mention the ongoing stress of keeping organisations afloat in the midst of global financial problems. I've heard some awful stories about how hard it is to keep a charity or NPO afloat right now.<p>But that makes me even more determined. Charities and NPOs should not be (but are) the ones to suffer most when times are hard.<p>Regarding specific technologies; it all depends on projects and is somewhat volunteer driven. An organisation might want (just for example) to make a campaign for mobile devices but will not care about which platform (or they might care but not enough to say no to an available Android developer).<p>I'm also very conscious of how these projects are supported after delivery (when the volunteer finishes). It won't be good if the net result is an unsustainable support and maintenance burden, so up-front planning is needed to a) avoid that or b) plan for it if necessary.<p>So far all the costs have been covered out of my pocket, and when I have good month (I'm a freelancer) I will sink some more into a marketing campaign.

Where countries drive on the road can be related more to how programming languages define blocks of code. C-like languages use curly braces to define blocks. This can be related to how since medieval times, horses rode on the left side of the road. More modern languages use different ways to define blocks of code. For example, Python uses tabbing and whitespace, Ruby uses the `end` keyword.<p>Continuing to use the traffic analogy, you don't <i>have</i> to use cruise control while driving on a long stretch of highway, but it's a lot easier to, and everyone else does. In the article, raganwald is talking about how coding conventions and techniques evolve over time. The analogy about driving in the UK vs the US is more equivalent to the syntactic rules of the specific language you are working with; it's the <i>law</i> which side of the road to drive on. You'll get penalized if you do otherwise. Using or not using cruise control is your choice, and so are naming conventions in different languages. Conventions evolve, even when the specific ""laws"" of the languages don't change as quickly, or at all.",1351791295

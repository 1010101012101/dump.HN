The HAProxy configs are kept up to date using a tool called &quot;Synapse&quot; that queries ZK.  ZK is kept up-to-date by their own health check service, &quot;Nerve&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve developed similar myself, using LVS, for a private Australian CDN.

The thing here is that the problem of &quot;wrapping&quot; a sequence instead of throwing some kind of Out-of-bounds-the-sky-is-falling error is pretty common and it deserves generic solution. You - and structural programming, for that matter - trapped a solution to this problem inside a solution for carousel. That&#x27;s exactly one of more important things OOP came to fix.<p>But I guess it&#x27;s true that &quot;the OO people tend to only teach modelling on problems with really quite obvious decompositions&quot;. I think nearly 100% of examples of OO in tutorials and books are completely useless and that there should be some major change in the way of teaching and thinking about OO. For me, that I managed to come up with a useful abstraction back then was pure luck. Later, when I saw Smalltalk - and worked in it for some time - I finally understood what OO is about and how beautifully it can simplify and generalize problems which would be one-off with procedural/structured programming.",1382564205

The free software movement seeks to educate people on why they should care, and why it&#x27;s valuable for companies to give users freedom instead of trying to lure them into proprietary licensing traps. I don&#x27;t know what you gain from viewing GNU/Linux as a product that is supposed to compete with proprietary software on the same level, because it&#x27;s not that at all. As we&#x27;ve seen from countless failed companies trying to pitch GNU/Linux on the desktop, traditional marketing strategies for proprietary software do not carry over to free software. This is the true misallocation of resources and it&#x27;s the only thing causing the &quot;wheel-spinning&quot; you&#x27;re referring to.<p>>Sinking a couple of million into a game and providing it for free is not exactly a winning strategy.<p>It&#x27;s free as in freedom, not free as in price. Most if not all games sell based on content anyway, which doesn&#x27;t need to be free (as in freedom or as in price) to resolve the problem of the users being treated like garbage and being forced into a subservient relationship.",1382563736

I think this would certainly be true of things like DNS, although I&#x27;m not sure how to accomplish this.<p>Of course, in many ways, decentralized systems are rather counter-intuitive. They&#x27;re possible technically, and the math is often elegant, but very few non-technical people encounter enough systems like this to be comfortable with the idea. Of course, a market is a perfect example of a decentralized system, but most people don&#x27;t think of a market as a <i>system</i> per se.<p>So perhaps this argument comes because the author does not realize or intuitively grasp the possibility that <i>nobody</i> need control the internet. And sure, when given the choice of whom to trust, the US is much better than <i>many</i> countries! Certainly better than Russia or China. And these countries have serious sway in the UN. Moreover, his point that the UN is not accountable to anyone is actually very important: while a democratic country like the US[1] is accountable to the people, the UN is only accountable to <i>governments</i>. Even in the US, we don&#x27;t vote for our UN representative! (Do we?) So it&#x27;s very indirect.<p>But what if <i>nobody</i> really controls the internet--what if we manage some decentralized, consensus based system? Or something.

Recommended in the &quot;Mavericks ruins Mail.app&quot; thread[0], I was surprised to find it only costs $2.  Given the lessons of Sparrow[1] (which sold for $3!), this doesn&#x27;t seem sustainable.<p>What&#x27;s their business model?  Is it entirely based on $2 upfront sales with no sustained support?

6601710,comment,6601091,6601394,2,0,jack-r-abbit,,,"My youngest has a fairly strong intolerance to soy. And we&#x27;ve just gotten to a stage where he can eat eggs that are cooked into stuff (muffins, pancakes, etc) but not just by themselves (fried, scrambled, etc). We haven&#x27;t even tried nuts with him yet. When people think of food allergies they think nuts because that is the more common one and more likely to cause anaphylaxis. Less attention is given to intolerances (maybe because they are not <i>typically</i> fatal). That is starting to change though. When I tell people he&#x27;s intolerant to soy they don&#x27;t really grasp what that means. It is probably 100 times easier to avoid nuts than it is to avoid soy. Soy is in practically everything. Particularly the things kids like to eat. My kid is too young to really benefit from this app since he can&#x27;t really tell me his mood. All I could do is notice if he starts throwing up or has nasty diapers. But I can totally see this helping people who need to track their reactions to foods.",1382562303

This is still considered expensive by people who have been living in Berlin for just few years more. The rents are still rising since many people are coming to Berlin at the moment; and have been quite high in hip districts like Prenzlauer Berg for a while, but there is definitely no comparison to many other large cities in Europe like London (and none to  the Bay Area at all, where you can literally end up paying $700 for a room shared with a stranger, next to the gap in general living expenses).",1382562157

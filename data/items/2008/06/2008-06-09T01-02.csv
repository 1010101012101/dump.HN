It's about half way along the process right now and will complete in ~15 years bringing it to the level of developed nations.  Exact figures vary based on who you believe.<p>Interestingly this growth stops around the time they run in to the demographic brick wall with more older people than younger due to the single child policy.  Not going to be pretty in the late 2020's for China I think.",1212975986

It was obvious to many people that it was a better way to control a computer, yet it took two decades even to begin reaching a mass audience. Or consider the hyperlink, invented independently by Mr. Engelbart and the computing evangelist Ted Nelson in the mid-1960s. It took roughly three decades to reach the public in the form of the World Wide Web.""<p>These examples are starting to wear thin.  It took three decades for computers to become accessible enough, financially, for these things to even make sense to offer to the masses, and it required a critical mass of users to make sense to start doing business over the Internet.  A wikipedia that no one could edit or an Amazon that no one bought anything on because they didn't have a computer in their home would be quite lame indeed.<p>The invention of the printing press didn't make everyone literate overnight; the 30 years it took for the mouse to enter widespread adoption is nothing.",1212975834

212418,comment,212221,212340,0,0,aston,,,"The idea would be to read in the entire dictionary and mark the Bloom Filter for each word. Then whenever you get a word you want to test, see whether all of the places it would mark were previously marked. If it misses any, you know it's not a word. Unfortunately, if it doesn't miss, you're only sure it's <i>probably</i> a word (with the worst case probability controlled by the number of hash functions you use).",1212975236

212406,comment,212200,212398,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"I just had to set the price of my own book, so I quickly learned where all the money goes. If the MSRP is $25.95, as mine is, then distributors who sell the book to bookstores or sites will require a 55% discount right away. That means that per copy, the publisher receives 45%, or $11.68. Of that 45%, a publisher might typically pay the author 10%, or $1.17 per copy. The printing costs are probably in the $3.50 (China) to $6.50 (United States) range, so the publisher stands to profit anywhere in the $7.01 (China) to $4.01 (United States) range.<p>When you print on demand, your printing costs are twice as high per copy, but since there's no middleman, you make more as an author. Of course, it's impossible to distribute, so it doesn't really matter. It's only a good option if you really only intend to sell a few copies to friends and family.",1212973709

After deciding to ditch New York publishers, I had the choice of [digital] print on demand versus offset printing for the release of my book, and I chose offset.<p>If you want to publish something that is taken seriously by the publishing world, print on demand simply isn't an option at this point in time. There are a couple reasons why. Many people, myself included, find it annoying to read digitally-printed books because the ink tends to reflect light a lot more. Also, many distributors simply will not accept books that are print on demand. It's difficult to reach bookstores without distributors.",1212973369

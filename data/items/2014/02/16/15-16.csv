7247973,comment,7247690,7247851,9,0,jordigh,,,"> And &quot;anti-GNU people&quot; is just a lame insult.<p>My point was that in the context of Emacs, arguably the GNUest of the GNU, being anti-GNU is nothing to scoff at. Indeed, bzr was chosen for a long time because it was an official GNU project and was usable enough.<p>The hg devs went through great pains to change the license from GPLv2 to GPLv2-or-later. Lead dev Matt Mackall calls himself a free software advocate (not open source) is good friends with the likes of Bradley Kuhn and Eben Moglen of Software Freedom Conservancy and the Software Freedom Law Center respectively, and makes a point about defending Mercurial&#x27;s copyleft. Ideology being important for GNU Emacs, it also seemed important to me to argue in favour of Mercurial on these grounds.<p>That Mercurial also happens to be fast, featureful, innovative, and generally kickass is a nice cherry on top. Its only significant drawback is that it&#x27;s not as popular as git.",1392566340

7247971,comment,7247095,7247409,1,0,brudgers,,,"The economic argument falls a bit flat, because it ignores both basic economics and its own premise that time is money.<p>Most people who can directly translate time into money - those for whom four hours of time spent repairing a device equates to 4 hours * x/hour are in a position where they cannot add four hours to their workweek. They do not set their own hours or are at the ceiling of paid hours or cannot acquire additional paying work.<p>On the other hand, the argument completely ignores the time costs normally associated with acquiring a new piece of electronics. These include the time spent researching hardware, comparison shopping, physical acquisition, learning the features of the new device [since it is unlikely to be identical to the old] and then configuring the device to meet one&#x27;s expectations.<p>Consider the author&#x27;s economic options:<p><pre><code>  - purchase a used older iPad similar to the damaged one.\n\n  - replace it as a tablet and compare Windows, Android,\n    and iOS products.\n\n  - replace it with another Apple product without\n    considering other products.\n</code></pre>\nThe time and effort involved in researching and acquiring a device in the first two alternatives to repair is fairly obvious.<p>Even in the third case, there&#x27;s still potential for enormous time spent comparing various models and optional configuration and reading reviews to decide on the exact specification, then potentially searching for the best price.<p>What really makes the third choice attractive is not the time savings but the simplicity of the decision tree. Deciding on another iPad immediately carries less mental overhead. This is exactly the same advantage as repair - a person can make a direct decision as soon as the device breaks.<p>The advantage of repair is that it scales. Buying a soldering iron potentially reduces the cost of future repairs. Buying a replacement device stands no chance of reducing the cost of future replacement devices. Consumer oriented behaviour produces nothing but more consumer oriented behaviour. In that sense it is economically irrational.",1392566181

Macs are pretty reliable but when they do go wrong, it&#x27;s always expensive and catastrophic.</i><p>Well, if it&#x27;s under 3 years, then you&#x27;re covered under warranty, no?<p>><i>A good friend of mine worked in an Apple Store in London and they had a scary high number of machines with logic board failures in 2012. That never gets recorded on the stats because the machines disappear and come back magically working with no explanation as to what was wrong.</i><p>Well, there&#x27;s not much of an explanation I guess. It just happens that certain productions runs are faulty. Could be a misaligned machine at the factory, some part outsourced that had lower tolerance than expected, etc.<p>These things happens when you have runs of several million exact same machines outsourced to several factories. So a faulty run of some thousands could have been dropped in London. What could Apple do? Post a bulletin that this sub-component of the logic board is faulty and have users attempt fix it? The logical thing to do was to replace the whole thing and perhaps sell the old machines as refurbished models.<p>(There was a similar problem with logic boards on G3 iBooks, back around 2003 or so. And there are always problems with a percentage of any production run, sometimes with hard disks, displays, GPUs, whatever. No way to avoid it, nothing is perfect. They cant even test most of those beforehand, because some are issues that develop after some use, and people are always demanding faster delivery and complaint of stores not stocking new models fast enough).",1392566143

To each in turn:<p>* Swartz was in the process of creating something novel for which public data sets with a fair market value of zero dollars &quot;housed&quot; in JSTOR was required.<p>* Admission status is irrelevant. MIT is and always has been an open campus.<p>* Very true. You and the authors of Tidbits and most likely every reader of this comment located in the US also violated several policies / rules of their state, local, federal governments just by waking up this morning, taking a shower, and cooking breakfast.  If you are involved in a creative endeavor of any significance you will find it almost necessary to bend/break rules of institutions that will in turn benefit from that very creativity.<p>* Very true. You are currently also violating the EULA of several software applications misusing your own computer resources.<p>* Debatable.

7247953,comment,7247170,7247170,9,0,mark_l_watson,,,"I helped found the VR lab at SAIC many years ago. We did 3D sound (via head related transfer functions), full on motion platforms, haptic feedback (e.g., a race car goes off the track a little, and you feel the chatter in the steering wheel), and SGI Reality Engine 3D graphics.<p>The problem? It was cost. We had a tentative agreement to put VR racing pods in a Las Vegas hotel, but after the prototypes where developed (and they were great fun!), we did better cost analysis and cancelled the project because the &quot;ride&quot; would have been way too expensive for end users. The custom motion platform was especially expensive, but added so much to the experience.<p>Later at a different company, I was lead programmer for a VR demo system for Disney. The demo was great, but when they deployed to production in Disney World they had to cut corners on the motion platform, etc.<p>edit: my point is that there is a lot more to VR than just 3D graphics - if you want to achieve what is called &quot;suspension of disbelief.&quot;",1392565940

In retrospect, choosing Bazaar as DVCS was a mistake that has presented unnecessary friction costs to a lot of contributors. RMS gets this and we’re moving.<p>I’m also talking with RMS about the possibility that it’s time to shoot Texinfo through the head and go with a more modern, Web-friendly master format. Oh, and time to abolish info entirely in favor of HTML. He’s not entirely convinced yet of this, but he’s listening.&quot;</i><p>He&#x27;s also involved in freeing code-repositories from their prisons, and porting them to other versioning systems, with the Reposurgeon.

You&#x27;ll be stuck trying to diagnose and fix issues with very little guidance, because only a handful of other people may have implemented the same solution as you.<p>Having a single, canonical solution, even if it it&#x27;s imperfect, is usually better than having a myriad of equally imperfect options.

7247885,comment,7247415,7247415,4,0,moron4hire,,,"I tend to think that UPSERT is the right solution to the wrong problem.<p>Take the example of a user profile. The problem for me is not typically &quot;the first time the user shows up, I need to create a record, and all other times, I need to overwrite it.&quot; In the systems I build, there is almost always a use case for having full access to the history of data. So the better solution is, &quot;I must ALWAYS update whatever record exists AND insert a new record&quot;.<p>That means my UserProfile table also has two extra columns, CreatedOn <i>and</i> InvalidatedOn. Then, creating/updating a user&#x27;s email address is always the same, two statement operation:<p><pre><code>    -- If UserName does not yet exist, this does nothing\n    UPDATE UserProfile\n    SET InvalidatedOn = NOW()\n    WHERE UserName = ?\n    AND NOW() BETWEEN CreatedOn AND InvalidatedOn;\n\n    INSERT INTO UserProfile(UserName, Email, <etc.>, CreatedOn, InvalidatedOn)\n    VALUES(?, ?, <etc.>, NOW(), MAX_DATE());\n</code></pre>\nIn practice I would use default value constraints for the CreatedOn and InvalidatedOn columns. Writing it explicitly is just for this example.<p>This becomes really important once you&#x27;ve lived with your database for several months/years, and <i>especially</i> when dealing with customers. For example, say you send an important email to a user, then they change their email address, then you send more important emails referring to the first one, which they now claim they never received in the first place. With an UPSERT, that user&#x27;s email address for all of time looks like the most current version, and you can&#x27;t figure out why they didn&#x27;t receive the first one.<p>It&#x27;s better to capture more data and realize down the road that you don&#x27;t need it than it is to not capture enough and realize you need more. Databases are temporal objects. They grow over time and they change over time.<p>Another example from my past: a client would send us a dump of their data, every morning. We were performing analysis of their data and were supposed to wipe out our database and re-import it every morning. This meant on day N+1 we were re-importing the first N days again. I implemented this as a temporal database, which caught me some hell when the database grew in size. But, after 6 months, we discovered someone had attempted to alter the historical data. If we had blindly taken the data, they would have gotten away with their crime (and it literally was a crime, we had several government regulations we had to fulfill, the project being used in both a health-care and a financial capacity).<p>I&#x27;ve never regretted implementing my tables temporally. I&#x27;ve sometimes changed the implementation to a data warehouse setup, after learning that the historical data wasn&#x27;t necessarily important to day-to-day operation, but I&#x27;ve never regretted having the historical data available, and I have almost always learned to regret NOT having historical data.",1392565054

Git seems far friendlier to the workflow of just doing stuff, and deciding how you want to commit it later. In Git, it&#x27;s easy to work for a while, then decide you have 3 commits worth of changes, and one of them really ought to be in its own branch, and commit it all like that. The code that you branched off stays out of your mainline for now, but is easy to switch back to and work on some more. At any time, you can easily delete the branch, and it all effectively disappears, push it somewhere else for somebody else to work on, or merge it back into main when it&#x27;s ready. Well, merging might be tricky if you wait too long, but you get the idea.<p>Where Mercurial falls short to me is that if you create a branch in your main repository like that, then it never goes away as far as I can tell. What Mercurial really wants you to do is clone your repo, and do that work that would be a Git branch in the clone. But to do that, you have to start with a clean repo, actively decide you want to create a new branch/clone, clone your repo, and only then start doing that work in the clone. If you&#x27;ve already done some work, and then decided that a piece of it ought to be branched off, then your workflow is pretty messy - you have to clone with the work uncommitted, then manually move the changes over to the clone and commit them there. And switch any working directories you might have open to the clone directory to work in it.<p>Yeah, no thanks, I&#x27;ll stick with Git.",1392564376

It&#x27;s not the worst hash out there, by far, but it can be calculated relatively quickly which may make finding collisions easier as new insights and faster technology becomes available. Bcrypt has a variable number of iterations in the algorithm. Increasing the number of iterations makes the hashing a lot more computationally intensive. Sufficiently so to make brute force attempts intractable for now.

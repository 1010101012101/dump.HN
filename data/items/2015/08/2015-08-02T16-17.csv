After that you can branch out or be bought by Facebook in fear of you branching out.<p>I get your point, though. If I were Google I would have started the whole Google+ thing as a publishing platform for businesses and/or regular news publishers and bloggers, using some benefits within the search to lure them in. Facebook clearly pisses them of as they try to squeeze them. That way Google could have gotten some content first.<p>Next push some commenting-system on top of it (as they did) but without the Feed-Posts appearing there and all the other crap.<p>They already had Hangouts/Voice and Picasa, why did they even need to cripple all these services.

Others are not required to offer content for free and I don&#x27;t feel entitled to it. If it&#x27;s there for free, maybe I&#x27;ll consume it, maybe not. It&#x27;s only the content creators who think their consumers feel entitled to free content because they&#x27;re too stupid to come up with better business models to market their content. As a writer, musician, and artist, I offer a lot of my content for free with no ads and have no problem with that. I actually enjoy creating it and don&#x27;t do it for the ad revenue. If other content creators want to charge for their content or wrap it up in ads, it&#x27;s up to them to figure out a business model that works for their purpose. Their failing to do so does in no way reflect a failing in anyone&#x27;s morality except possibly theirs.<p>tl;dr: If my ad-blocking is hurting these content creators so much, they should figure out a way to deliver ads that can&#x27;t be blocked and stop calling the consumers names like &quot;entitled&quot; (because that&#x27;s another reason the consumers don&#x27;t want to pay for that mediocre two-paragraph piece surrounded by 10 megs of ads).

I suspect Google+, and the cannibalizing of other projects, was directed by Page.  He became CEO in April 2011.  G+ launched in late June 2011.  April-May-June is about 90 days.  From the article:<p>> The massive Google+ launch effort had all the hallmarks of a technology corporation: a code name (&quot;Emerald Sea&quot;), <i></i>an artificial timeline (100 days to launch!)<i></i>, a dedicated secret building (<i></i>with the CEO relocated there<i></i>) and a full PR blitz once completed.<p>The CEO puts his office in the G+ building.  I see that as Page being the driving force behind this.  The article says:<p>> &quot;Vic was just this constant bug in Larry&#x27;s ear: &#x27;Facebook is going to kill us. Facebook is going to kill us,&#x27;&quot; says a former Google executive. &quot;I am pretty sure Vic managed to frighten Larry into action. And voila: Google+ was born.&quot;<p>But for what actually happened to have happened, Page had to have bought into the idea independently (assuming he is independent).  Every article I&#x27;ve seen about G+&#x27;s failure fails to mention anything about Page&#x27;s role - this article goes <i>out of its way</i> in this strange way to try to say Page was just &#x27;whispered to too much&#x27;.<p>> By early 2014, less than three years after its big launch, the Google+ team had moved out of its coveted building to a spot on campus further from Page. Gundotra announced his departure from the company that April — in a Google+ post, of course — to pursue &quot;a new journey.&quot;<p>The G+ push/force was still in full-swing on the consumer side through 2014.  Evidence that Page was the driving force, not Vic.<p>This was an organization-centric article, but I wish it had mentioned the other potential causes for G+&#x27;s failure, such as being invite-only during the media attention, and the rude forcing of people over from other platforms (Reader, YouTube, Maps, business listings, etc).",1438533765

From my observation, Facebook is dying a slow death. I see most of my Facebook &quot;friends&quot; aren&#x27;t posting anything anymore and just browse. Some only post check-ins when they travel, otherwise everything is deadly silent. I have my Facebook disabled most of the time, but every once in a while i login to see what&#x27;s going on with some folks across the pond and all I see is everyone reposting news. Facebook has become a boring place to read quirky news and get on with the rest of your day.

It began at Harvard, moved out to the Ivies, then the top 100 universities, then all universities, then everyone. By this point, it had iterated its way out of the technical failings of the initial product (except for the use of PHP, which still hasn&#x27;t been entirely undone).<p>Google+, when it started, was superior in almost every way to Facebook in its first few years. (That&#x27;s not a fair comparison. Facebook was a startup social network; Google+ came out of the gate at 120 mph.) It had Hangouts, which would have been a killer app if people had actually used them as a sharable social space (i.e. to &quot;hang out&quot;) as the execs thought they would. The problem was that Google thought its muscle would allow it to take a greatest-fixed-point approach (i.e. a &quot;stay popular once popular&quot; strategy) whereas any social network needs to focus on the <i>least</i> fixed point, because that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s going to land. It had wealth but no users and no credibility, and it wasn&#x27;t able to get those.<p>Hangouts are genuinely useful and there was some guy at Google who argued that courting independent game developers (and getting high quality products, rather than third-string products and Zyngarbage from mainstream publishers who expected Google+ to fail and weren&#x27;t going to use their best stuff) would have allowed Google+ to grow organically and inductively, with the same &quot;cognitively upscale&quot; initial user base that made Facebook, thus proving Hangouts and moving to progressively larger subsets of the population. It became obvious that the failure of Google Games (and, possibly, of Google+ in its entirety) came from Google&#x27;s leadership not listening to him.

Citing Gates as your anecdotal evidence to make a point about policy that affects millions of people is outright silly. It&#x27;s like saying government policy should prevent people from going to university, and dropping out once they get in, because hey Bill Gates did it and look how that turned out. Why refer to one of the most extreme outliers in modern history as a justification for medical policy for completely different, average people?<p>I don&#x27;t even get what your point is. I made the point that it probably makes more sense to save 1% of 15 year olds (or 25 year olds for that matter, considering the other post on how children distort our perspective of morality), than 1% of 80 year olds, or 60 year olds for that matter, given a common situation of scarce resources and the need to make a trade off. (again in cases where resource scarcity doesn&#x27;t matter, the discussion is irrelevant).<p>If you want to counter that with the point that &#x27;but some 60 year olds are still productive, look at bill gates, his impact will be tremendous the next decades&#x27; then you fail to see how statistically that 60 year old may have already been dead 35 years earlier, and that statistically for every bill gates you&#x27;d save at 60, in this hypothetical situation, you&#x27;d give up a younger bill gates who now dies at 25, and it may be said that despite his tremendous impact late in life, it doesn&#x27;t rival his impact earlier in life, and that this (having more impact before 60 than after 60) probably holds true on average, generally speaking.

And while there&#x27;s a need for resolution when there&#x27;s a bad contract, that resolution system doesn&#x27;t always have to be a person.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple theoretical example. People operate under a common, universal law system that defines the most basic rights. The rules of this system are only those which everyone who participates can agree to. For example, everyone agrees not to kill each other. People who do not accept these rules can form alternative societies, but they will not be able to access areas under common law through the use of smart locks and the like which restrict access to public spaces only to those who accept basic terms of behavior.<p>These rules can be under constant revision because the code that runs the base social platform is publicly audited, and anyone can submit a request to edit it. These revisions can be tested at smaller scales just by running the rules in private spaces. In your home, you can set whatever rules you want, but anyone running software with conflicting preferences will be alerted to the changes when they enter. If your home rules become popular with your friends, they may choose to implement them in their home. If enough people adopt them, the community may choose to implement them in certain spaces, and they can propagate outward.<p>The basis of this type of system would be mutual consent, and what a person consents to do can be adjusted at any time by their own software. It would be important that a person&#x27;s personal platform was entirely under their control and only interacted with the outside world through approved protocols. Likely this would require a direct brain connection that could not be hacked because of physical safeguards.<p>Business could be conducted between communities that operated under entirely different rules through automatic contract negotiation. New ideas could spread from private to public spaces automatically through smart social contracts.<p>This is just one, very basic example of a society run by smart contracts. There&#x27;s plenty of ways for these types of systems to be exploited, but that&#x27;s part of the design process of any system. Particularly difficult is the problem of letting a machine which can be manipulated dictate so much of life.<p>But people&#x27;s brains can be hacked already. Look at advertising, religious cults, mob mentality. People have always been vulnerable to manipulation, and we have developed an interconnected financial system where almost anything can be bought, especially power. We can learn from existing flaws as we develop new systems to fix the bugs in our biology and political systems that have made us vulnerable. We will definitely introduce new vulnerabilities. We just have to make sure we have a robust plan for continued development to respond to them.",1438532848

Often, the guy who decides to buy a dipshit startup for $2 billion will get, a year later, a VP-level position in a &quot;unicorn&quot; with 5% equity and zero responsibilities.

They were casing my wife and I every time we went there for a train.<p>Right now, the big thing is to send in kids with a piece of paper, asking you to sign it and give them a donation. The kids sometimes pretend to be deaf, and they basically demand a minimum donation of 8 euros. Their piece of paper is all crumpled and filthy, but the kids usually look like normal European 8-year-old girls, often blond and cleanly dressed.<p>However, somewhere behind these girls, probably 20 to 30 feet away, will be a handler. The few we saw were always old women who looked like Eastern European grandmothers, and were probably the &quot;Roma&quot; everyone likes to call out.<p>This handler floats behind the kids and watches where phones and wallets go when they&#x27;re placed back in pockets. She then drifts by if you engage the kids. The kids are the distraction, she&#x27;s the pickpocket.<p>Frankly, though, if you pay any attention at all to the areas around you at Gare du Nord, or anywhere else in Europe, it&#x27;s very easy to see this stuff going down and be safe. We were warned a dozen times about theft in Europe before our lengthy trip, but really, you just have to behave as you would in Manhattan or in San Francisco.<p>Frankly, you can lose your phone just as quickly in the Mission if you&#x27;re on a busy bus and not paying attention.",1438532222

Of course, the funny thing about motivations and aspirations is that they could appear clear till the time there is an inflection point in the business and results surpass expectations. Knowing you are spearheading and are part of a &#x27;cult-backed&#x27; growth can often set back your prior motivations of cashing out on a big payoff from an established player.<p>Why stop now and if I do, what do I do next?

It&#x27;s a silly thing--I don&#x27;t believe in fate or fortunes--but sometimes silly things can be made to work for us.<p>So I could say that was &quot;the moment I became X&quot;, where X is any major achievement since, but &quot;One weird trick to stay motivated and focused on your goals&quot; would be at least as accurate.",1438531490

Accumulating a sustainable amount of money isn&#x27;t as easy as raising a few rounds on a weak idea. It takes a real idea, perseverance, and thinking really long term. The mindset quoted above isn&#x27;t likely to support any of these requirements.<p>So, really what you&#x27;ll end up with is a nice house, a pretty car, and a few fake friends while it&#x27;s all running smoothly. The second you can no longer deliver it all goes away. I might be in the minority here, but I plan to leave my children an empire. Not a house of cards.",1438531460

While nobody should be sentenced to suffer severe pain for the rest of his life, just because your body isn&#x27;t as capable as it used to be doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that you want to end your life. Often there will be people that you will leave behind and you certainly don&#x27;t want to explain them that it&#x27;s your <i>decision</i> to do just that.<p>On top of that, this is also dangerous from a social perspective where people could get a feeling that they are supposed to go once there is nothing they can contribute to society anymore.<p>We should rather focus on allowing making &quot;regular&quot; dying more dignified rather than promoting euthanasia.",1438531362

In the other hand, QEMU&#x27;s goal is rather the emulation of an entire system and different audio/video hardware (basically, a virtual machine).",1438531215

If it is code that will run in production for many years I will pick another language than if it is a quick-and-dirty I need the answer now type thing.<p><i>Every</i> language, your favorite too, has its pros and cons.<p>If there were a single, perfect language I do not doubt that it would overrun the world of programming in the time it would take to spread the news.<p>But languages are trade-offs. Space, speed, readability, maintainability, expressiveness. All of those (and probably more) can be changed enough to give a spectrum of possibilities, and with enough spacing between those in the various dimensions you end up with a large number of viable languages.<p>And that's good. A lisp programmer will solve something in a completely different way from a C programmer or a prolog programmer. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.<p>In the end all that matters is that your solution produces correct results (and not just in the logical sense of 'correct', also correct for all the other parameters).<p>As long as it performs well for you everything else is premature optimization ;)<p>Incidentally, I put out a little challenge on this exact subject:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1073333"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1073333</a>",1264420717

The increased costs are spread over a long enough time that most people will make their decision based solely based on 'iPhone vs iPhone clone' and the sticker price. As long as there's a $30/month difference, it won't fundamentally change the market.<p>Further, pricing differences are generally carrier based, not device based- once iPhone is on Verizon, the monthly cost for unlimited data will be the same as getting a Droid, negating any advantage. Third rate carriers like T-Mobile and Sprint will offer lower cost plans, but they too will eventually get iPhones.<p>I just don't see how there are 'openness' advantages this time around- I think last time, 'openness' was really 'pricing'.",1264420607

The author doesn't say he ""think there isn't any patent problem with Theora"", he very carefully says that he hasn't found any.<p>And that is precisely my point — since you can never be entirely sure, using Theora (or VP6, or any other video codec for that matter) won't solve much in the long term.<p>BTW, as a related note it should be mentioned that at least Theora developers chose the right license for this kind of code — BSD.

Even more often, they give up and fade out, blaming some little thing or external cause for their failure.<p>The creation of valuable new technologies, while challenging, seems like a cakewalk compared to the moral weight you're required to bear when running a company.

You need a lot more Hadoop nodes to make it comparable. At least throughput per AWS dollar should be reported.<p>The ~100k files inverted index test is completely unfair to Hadoop: launching 100k map task per small file is ridiculous as it's basically measuring JVM startup time. People/crawlers typically put all these pages in large map/sequence files. Hadoop would automatically launch a map task per chunk (default 128MB).<p>Fetching data to EC2 for computation is also a step backward. It cannot scale on large data as the cluster will become switch bound much ealier than the ""kosher"" map-reduce, where data locality is observed.<p>In any case, it's neither fast or lean (it's basically Java glue code to use S3/SQS/SimpleDB, and seems to have larger overall carbon footprint than Hadoop)",1264419423

When one loadbalancer goes down, another one picks up the same IP address of the one that went down, and the whole thing fails over to another datacenter.<p>Of course, the load balancers have a lot more webservers behind this, but this is what we consider a pretty highly availalbe solution for the front-end.<p>The problem is in the backend: how do you handle databases going down ? Do you make a master/slave setup like the loadbalancers I just described? Or a multi-master that sync periodically ? It all depends upon your requirements.

They feel embarrassed when they are caught, even before they are punished.  The likelihood of being caught stealing a physical product is rather high, and once you layer on the punishments, which are rather large, it's enough to make most people refrain from shoplifting.<p>Unfortunately for digital media, stealing and getting caught are both extremely impersonal acts, so there's very little embarrassment or guilt involved.  And getting caught is so rare that the financial penalties are all but meaningless.<p>In my opinion all of these industries need to stop worrying about what is ""due"" them for their hard work, and start worrying about what the optimal price points, payment systems, and purchase/discovery paths are to get paying customers.  These may be very different from the current levels, and may require radical steps: I don't think it's out of the question to offer vastly different prices, going as low as you can imagine, to different people based on how likely you think it is they will purchase the item.

Well it worked - they certainly affected the marketability, and here we are, with the developer who stands up in a meeting and says ""so, what about Ogg Vorbis support?"" looks and sounds like an idiot. Well done.<p>I don't even like having an .ogg file on my computer, the name annoys me so much. You might say names are irrelevant and maybe they are to you, but they're not to me.",1264417342

We run our service off Amazon's cloud system, which gives us a lot of flexibility.<p>If you need assistance on how to structure your freemium model to make sense, send me an email at niyi [at] trafficspaces [dot] com.",1264417300

In that way, if some submarine patent surfaces and is used against a licensee, they have legal recourse against the original license authority.",1264417215

How does it works (on most of the cases) today: You go to the physics lectures, learn a lot about theory and formulas, and so, you go to the lab and check the ""theory working""(bullshit!).<p>The point is: It's not natural. For milleniuns the man first observed some event on the nature and then tryied to figure out ""why"" and ""how"" it happens. It's not natural to first get the theory and then look to the action. You should first see something happening, something that dispert some curiosity, and then, moved by this curiosity, you should try to understand it (whatever does it mean).<p>My question here is: does it apply also to computer science and programming, or it only makes sense on physics, biology, chemestry ... ?",1340708365

4161157,comment,4160987,4161125,30,0,paol,,,"Sadly the parliament is essentially a powerless organ by design. The problem is that the european commission accumulates both executive power and most of the legislative power, where the later should lie with parliament.<p>The end result is that the parliament is basically a farcical attempt to give the appearance of democratic legitimacy to the EU legislative process, but the farce is transparent enough that it just ends up tainting the public perception of the EU institutions.<p>There are political reasons for this arrangement of course, but I don't want to turn this into (more of) a rant.

In ObjC you're mostly dealing with heap-allocated objects (by the way, remember that malloc is not deterministic too), and you don't have control over the objects' memory layout.<p>In the recent SDK, your typical NSNumber may be a tagged pointer or it may be a pointer to a number on heap -- you don't know, it's an implementation detail.<p>Hell, you don't even know the big O of NSArray! <a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/array.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/array.html</a><p>Oh, and autoreleasing. Do you know how many objects will be released at the end of your NSAutoreleasePool? Nope -- you don't know how many were allocated by other people's code you called.<p>2) Again, I don't know what ""manage environment"" you're arguing against, but from Go you certainly can call C functions. But nobody does this for speed, only for compatibility with existing C libraries, if needed. You're programming in Go, not in two languages.<p>Go is not a 'managed language', whatever this Microsoft's term means, so I'm not even sure what to answer to your last paragraph.",1340708220

Especially, since the discriminating factor is the fact that you are willing to pay more!<p>If a vendor wants to price discriminate, there are ways of doing it, such as loyalty programs or rewards, which do not 'offend' the consumer and still manage to capture (most of) the consumer surplus.<p>In this case though, this is not what Orbitz is doing, they keep the prices constant but show different default options.<p>Isn't that the right way to do it?

4161146,comment,4161010,4161010,2,0,kevinconroy,,,"It may be a matter of delayed syncing for certain websites with multiple legacy systems that aren't tightly integrate.<p>What I think is more likely, though, is that they are using a fairly sophisticated email service which is capable of generating millions of emails and queuing them up in advanced of a scheduled delivery date.<p>Say you had 10 Million subscribers that you wanted to email a coupon or offer to that was only good for the next 24 hours (e.g. ""Saturday's 1 Day Sale""). In order to get those into 10 Million inboxes within a 10 minute window you need to pre-process as much as possible. The email marketing person schedules emails to go out at a certain time, they are generated and queued, and then pushed out in bulk. Checking if you've unsubscribed is most efficiently done when generating the emails to be queued, not when going to send.<p>So when you go to unsubscribe, they might have an email or two in the queue ready to go to you. It's much easier to say it will take 48 hours for your unsubscribe request to go through than it is to explain that ""you're unsubscribed, but we might have a few emails in our pending queue that would be a pain for us to delete or prevent from going out, so please just forgive us during this period.""<p>(Side note: There's a surprising amount of interesting tech going on in some, but not all, email marketing programs.)",1340708149

And the incredibly irony here of the ""please think of the children"" mentality, is that it's reinforcing this feedback loop, and I don't see any way to break out of it.<p>The government can't legalise drugs because of the massive community backlash there would be. So the continued illegality, of the trade sees it linked to criminal activity on a macro scale (terrorist groups / bikies etc.) as well as at a local level (home invasions / thefts / pharma. raids etc.) not to mention the violence and the risk of overdose that prompts teary eyed parents to come on the news and espouse about the evils of drugs, leading to the (admittedly fairly compelling) conclusion that stamping out drugs would be a good thing.

We would take another companies email list and advertise to it, splitting the profit with the company that owned the data.<p>When an unsubscribe came in- sure, we could remove it from our own list, but we'd still have to give the unsubs to the original data owner, who'd need to then send the unsubs to any other companies that were using their data. And that's at the simplest, it can run multiple levels deep (i.e, Company A sells data to Company B who sells data to Company C).<p>Another reason is that ""targeting"" emails on a user-by-user basis can take lots of processing time, too much to be done in real-time when the email is being sent out, so they are often queued up several days in advance.",1340708001

The strongest negotiator will take a bigger share of the surplus.<p>Even if the surplus is split unfairly on many transactions, the market is still said to be efficient if it meets the above definition.<p>Louis CK's  ticketing idea is a pretty unique case because in some ways tickets are easily fungible and lend themselves to this traditional economic analysis.<p>On the other hand, if Louis ck decides he's only doing 50 shows at mid sized venues, and prices are 45 dollars, as long as all tickets sell the market is actually perfectly efficient. Louis has no more product to sell. If he could have sold the same amount of tickets at $65 all that means is that fans are taking more of the surplus, as opposed to scampers. Even though there might be way more fans than tickets, the market is at an efficient equilibrium because Louis CK's supply curve has become totally inellastic at $45.",1340706855

It's warm here."" I think it's a waste of lifetime to read such things. There are a lot of other things to do and new things to explore, which are more fun and don't monitor your activities all the day.",1340705086
4161029,comment,4156924,4159229,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"> But as long as they don't have the users, they are not better.<p>That's a truism. Crazygringo's point assumes that network effects are excluded from the measure of a ""better"" service. I think that's a fair basis for comparison, since the network effective advantage accrues from an <i>earlier period</i> in the marketplace's history: it's the prize won by being better/smarter than previous competitors. But it says nothing about the dominant service being better than <i>current</i>, newly launched competitors.<p>If you define ""better"" as having more users, then that's pretty much ex post facto reasoning and tells us little.<p>> And don't forget that recent history is filled with companies that were ""virtually impossible to defeat"" until they were beaten, and harshly.<p>1. The number of years that a company dominates <i>is</i> the measure of how much that company has won. The fact that a company eventually falls to a competitor doesn't mean that the company didn't profit handsomely for years or decades.<p>2. The fact that some large companies have fallen doesn't mean that the existing behemoths don't derive most of their advantage from network effects. Maybe we would have seen better, more open social networking startups emerge and win the market by now if Facebook's network effects were somehow nullified.<p>The ultimate point is that network effects are a very significant barrier to entry, and mitigating them would allow a more dynamic market for startups to compete in, and higher competition in the market (which is better for consumers). Imagine if all social networks were interoperable and people could choose which service they wanted to live on -- then there wouldn't be a tendency for a 1000-ton gorilla to emerge at the top of the heap.<p>(Funnily, I have nothing against Craigslist, since they're providing a very useful service at virtually no cost. They deserve their position, easily; their market's story is a happy one. Let's hope it happens in more places soon.)",1340705072

Several newspapers were reporting people whose house purchases fell through because their solicitors were using NatWest as an intermediary.<p>(I actually bank with Nationwide as well, although their online service is a bit odd. Then again, when is that not true for a bank?)",1340705029

4161019,comment,4160785,4160983,2,0,DaveChild,,,"I think it's fairly similar, at least in philosophy. I always liked some parts of FogBugz - minimum number of required fields, always one owner and making it as easy as possible to get bugs in to the system from multiple places - and those all things I continue to think are important, and have tried to get in to Envoy. Ease of bug addition is critical, as without it you can't get management to use the system and it fails, so all accounts automatically have an email address they can use to send in bugs. I'm looking at ways to use the API to tie into other systems too to make the addition of bugs as easy as possible from other places.",1340704842

The thing is <i>designed</i> to be hacked, that's the whole point of it.<p>The Arduino and this are two totally different classes of devices.<p>For staters, this appears to be very much about the hardware.  I wouldn't expect it to be open source, just like the iPhone or Motorola Droid you can develop your own apps for doesn't have open source hardware.  You don't actually have to be granted access to 100% of the codebase and hardware layout for a product just to develop a neat application around something.<p>I saw this and immediately thought of 5 or 6 cool uses for it so I bought one.  Sure, if I was going to build some kind of a product around this, or develop an app that was going to be my retirement income, I'd want a little more information about the company and their licensing models.

2223253,comment,2222431,2223148,0,0,jamwt,,,"Hi Antirez, thanks again for Redis.  Despite our few problems with it, it rocks.  A few comments:<p>> With fsync everysec, there is the problem that form time to time we need to fsync. Guess what? Even if we fsync in a different thread, write(2) will block anyway<p>Yep, but this could be avoided if a thread was devoted to all I/O incl. write() (and then line-level buffering really would be possible as well).  Communication with this thread would be on a thread-safe queue--the main thread would never block on disk I/O, and only two threads would mean mutex contention for the queue lock would be low.  This would be one solution, correct?  This is a variation of your ""two processes + pipe"" suggestion.<p>> How to fix that? For now we introduced in Redis 2.2 an option that will not fsync the AOF file while writing IF there is a compaction in progress.<p>Well, we enabled that.. but, we found that it's still a problem in a couple of circumstances:<p>1. Something <i>other than the AOF recompaction</i> makes the disk busy.  Like, say, even a moderate amount of disk activity by another process.<p>2. Redis's own logging to stdout, if redirected to a file, itself can cause the redis main thread to block if stdout is being flushed onto a busy disk.<p>Basically, if any I/O which may hit a disk (AOF record/flush or even logging) is being done on the single epoll-driven thread redis uses to process incoming requests, the system must make <i>very</i> good guarantees that those I/O calls will not block.  We have found these guarantees practically impossible to make on a very busy master, so we've given on up having the master do AOF work altogether.",1297803511

If those claims were realistic then companies with widely used web apps, such as several of Google's more recent offerings, would not be able to support IE. However, in practice it appears that these web apps run on IE just fine, and IE continues to hold the lion's share of the browser market.

2223245,comment,2218382,2218382,0,0,jackcat,,,"Positive move by Google, which should help the best content to rank in search.<p>However when Google start using this feedback data directly in their algorithm there are two dangers, which both can be overcome:<p>1. Abuse by SEOs trying to get their competitors blocked<p>2. Bad use of block data on a site wide basis in the search algorithm.  Eg just because certain pages on a site cause users to give block data doesn’t mean other pages on that site contain unique useful content.  High volume publishing or community sites will have a large degree of noise, but due to nature the cross section of society as members there will be also valid useful content in the seams.<p>One approach is to let individual users block sites forever (as the extension now) but use the block data on a page, not domain basis in the search algorithm. Individual pages can also increase in quality over time (the qoura business model) so changes in page content needs to be considered too.<p>The Internet is a better place with non editorial user generated content (hacker news is user generated) after all the human race mind based knowledge is a not all published online.

I'm not sure if current AMQP systems can handle this amount of messages with commodity hardware.<p>Another reason why Redis can be a good approach I think is that it is a simple system: simple to understand, simple to deploy, very stable. There is support for Pub/Sub. It also supports many other data types, so for instance, want a priority queue? Do it with a sorted set. What some special semantic for your message passing? possibly with BRPOPLPUSH you can do it. And so forth.<p>A common case of this flexibility is shown by RPOPLPUSH (without the ""B"" so the non blocking version). Using this command with the same source and destination list will ""rotate' the list providing a different element to every consumer, but the data will remain on the list. At the same time producers can push against the list. This has interesting real world applications when things must be processed against and again (fetching RSS feeds, for instance).<p>So Redis is a pretty flexible tool for messaging, and I think there are for sure great use cases for AMQP but with big overlaps with Redis, and also with use cases where Redis is definitely a better alternative.",1297802704

As a way to show my appreciation I want to focus on the bad side of the matter.<p>The article mentions that with AOF persistence there is a problem about fsync. I'll try to go in further details here.<p>Basically when using Redis AOF you can select among three levels of fsync: fsync always that will call fsync after every command, before returning the OK message to the client. Bank-alike security that data was written on disk, but very very slow. Not what most users want.<p>Then there is 'fsync everysec' that just calls fsync every second. This is what most users want. And finally 'fsync never' that will let the OS decide when to flush things on disk. With Linux default config writing buffers on disk can be delayed up to 30 seconds.<p>So with fsync none, there are no problems, everything will be super fast, but durability is not great.<p>With fsync everysec, there is the problem that form time to time we need to fsync. Guess what? Even if we fsync in a different thread, write(2) will block anyway.<p>Usually this does not happen, as the disk is spare. But once you start compacting the log with the BGREWRITEAOF command, the disk I/O increases as there is a Redis child trying to perform the compaction, so the fsync() will start to be slow.<p>How to fix that? For now we introduced in Redis 2.2 an option that will not fsync the AOF file while writing IF there is a compaction in progress.<p>In the future we'll try to find even Linux-specific ways to fsync without blocking. We just want to say the kernel: please flush the current buffers, but even if you are doing so, new writes should go inside the write buffer, so don't try to delay new writes if the fsync in progress is not yet completed. This way we can just fsycn every second in another thread.<p>Another option is to write+fsync the AOF log in a different process, talking with the main process via a pipe. Guess what? The current setup at Bump is somewhat doing this already with the master->slave setup. But there should be no need to do this.<p>So surely things will improve.<p>About diskstore, this is I think better suited for a different use case, that is: big data, much bigger than RAM, but mostly reads, and need to restart the server without loading everything in memory. So I think Bump is already using Redis in the best way, just we need to improve the fsync() process.",1297802005

I am sure all of us know somebody who is habitually late, and they have all kinds of excuses for it.  So do people who are only sometimes late.  This is just bad time management.

2223112,comment,2222787,2222787,0,0,chrisclark1729,,,"Wow.  I've been there.  3 times actually.  Unfortunately, your question is deceptively complex.  There are several smaller questions/concerns contained within your dilemma.<p>Financial:<p>Can you afford to quit? You say you are married.  If you don’t have kids, you’ll need 6 months living expenses.  Better yet would be to have a years’ worth.  I have heard conflicting reports on how easy it is to get unemployment if you quit.  For now, I would assume that you cannot get unemployment.<p>Next, Quit or Don’t?:<p>If you decide to quit - here’s what you should do:<p>1.	Give tons of notice.  Since you don’t have anywhere to go, you can keep earning money and be openly looking for a new gig.  The fact that it’s out in the open should alleviate some of the stress for you.<p>2.	 Figure out why you’re so unhappy.  Write down two answers.  First, an answer that is well rehearsed.  This is the answer you can tell your boss and co-workers so you don’t blow up and tell them they are killing you.  Second, an answer that is the real reason.  If you’re this miserable at a job you’re going to have to do some serious soul searching to figure out why and you’ll need a plan of attack to deal with these issues so they don’t disrupt you in the future<p>3.	Find the person who will be most upset about your quitting and manager your relationship with them.  This will be huge on down the line.<p>4.	Ultimately, be nice.  You’re leaving and the way you leave will stay with you forever in the minds of your bosses and co-workers.<p>If you decide to stay - here’s what you should do:<p>Don’t phone it in.  The anxiety of being at a job that you hate and continuing to do half-assed work will crush you.  Better to take risks on projects that have the chance to excite you and do great work for the company.  If you’re going to leave anyway, just find a way to politely decline the work you don’t want to do and pick a project that has a chance to be a game changer.<p>Next, look for another job.  I know this is obvious, although in my opinion, you have 3 ways to go with this:<p>Option 1:  Get another job, any job.  Call recruiters.  Call everyone you know.  Shotgun resumes.  Apply to jobs you know you can get and get a new one.  Once within the new job give yourself 6 weeks to determine if you like it.  If you like it, great, you have a job you like.  If you don’t, move on to Option 2 or 3 and figure out how the fuck you’re going to explain why you have been job hopping so aggressively.  Just be happy that you have a job that doesn’t make you cry.  If it does, go to therapy.<p>Option 2:  Figure out what your dream job is with extreme detail.  I mean everything where is it? What do you do? Who do you work for? What your boss is like? How much you will get paid? Size of company, revenue, industry, etc.  EVERYTHING.  Write at least 3 pages on this and find companies and positions that match your target and go after them with everything you’ve got.<p>Option 3: Start freelancing.  Be slightly less selective about the projects you take, but find a market that you are comfortable serving and do whatever it takes to give them what they want.  Maybe even finding a few projects that pay $15 or $20 an hour will give you and your wife more confidence that you can quit.  And if you do well you might be able to parlay those into an even more successful full-time side gig.<p>And when it’s all said and done and you have your dream job, do something nice for your wife.  Dealing with this type of thing really sucks for women and I think taking a trip with her and showing her that you’re happy will do wonders for both of your psyches.",1297801399

Socket.io is great, fantastic even, and I think it is something that really shows the power of node.js; there is something built on top of socket.io that is even more wonderful, and it is called dnode[0]. It is really simple to use, but has a lot of potential for server process to server process and server to client communication. It is in effect RPC, and I really can't do it justice.<p>For the example you give up here, you could easily overwrite the Backbone.sync function and have it instead send the appropriate objects you need to fetch models on the server, while having the server call back to the client with said models. Not only that but you could easily remotely invoke the model changed functions in Backbone directly from the server. There is so much more you can do, but I lack the knowledge at this point to put it in play just yet.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/substack/dnode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/substack/dnode</a> & <a href=""http://substack.net/posts/85e1bd/DNode-Asynchronous-Remote-Method-Invocation-for-Node-js-and-the-Browser"" rel=""nofollow"">http://substack.net/posts/85e1bd/DNode-Asynchronous-Remote-M...</a>",1297801373

While I can't pretend to know anything about your scaling challenges or the intimate details of how messaging is utilized, I can say that there are the lessons of deep experience with messaging baked into AMQP. You may have (or perhaps you already have) to implement some of these features in the future. I know that I gave AMQP the cold shoulder for a while, only to finally come around and find out it solved many of the frustrations we were facing.",1297800356

How the <i>hell</i> does that connector even work?

They can do what they please.<p>It's insane because Apple have been suckered by their own advertising.  Yes, the iPad is one of a kind at the moment, but the android tablet is right around the corner.  And that android tablet will be running Kindle and Nook apps.<p>While the payment platform and app store helps create the ecosystem for apps to exist, the iPad owes it's current success to the the apps people sell for it, not to the payment platform or the app store.  The app store and the UI library is a precondition, but it is not sufficient -- if no one made apps for it, no one would buy an iPad.<p>An iPad without Kindle is slightly worse than a sh*tty microsoft win7 tablet IMO.  iBooks is currently not very successful as an alternative. because unlike iTunes, Apple has established competitors who execute very well in this space.<p>If they try to play hardball with Amazon, Google Android tablets will then just wipe the floor with Apple... same way microsoft did in the 90's.  More likely, Amazon is playing hardball with Apple... Maybe Apple will make an ""exception"" using some tricky accounting to get a part of that 30% back to Amazon.",1297800176

It was hugely popular and I was making thousands a month (totally passive) with it until it got acquired and went to shit.<p>I tested a bunch of things, ads in the sidebar, different registrars, etc, but the only thing that ever worked was GoDaddy, right in the search results. Ads in the sidebars are a waste of your time so don&#x27;t even bother.<p>I know how technical people feel about GD (I feel the same) but the truth is, their crazy upselling techniques work and you get paid commission on those, not so much on the domain name itself. I was often making north of $100 per customer I referred to them. Not sure if they still pay the same but needless to say, that was pretty awesome<p>I also had coupon codes that gave my users a discount AND made me a lot of money. If you can get that, it&#x27;s the holy grail. It just made no sense for my users not to click on the ad.<p>Good luck!",1373749199

It has a chance to be already cached (specially if you use Google&#x27;s CDN).<p>2. All browsers nowadays do 6 parallel requests per host. So using DNS prefetching with `rel=dns-prefetch` will be faster.<p>3. If you bundle jQuery with your site&#x27;s JS files, every time you change a single JS file of your own, your users will be forced to re-download your bundled jQuery.

For example, only accepting 0-confirmation transactions from certain origins with a traceable reputation, performance bond at trusted third party, or subject to other recourse/debt-collection.

Go to a doctor&#x27;s office which accepts walk-ins (most of them do -- in a pinch, every hospital will let you wait briefly for the emergency room, or you can Google for &quot;acute care center&quot; or &quot;urgent care center&quot;).  They&#x27;ll ask for your insurance information.   Tell them that you have none and will be self-paying.  You&#x27;ll fill out a brief form, be seen by the doctor, likely get a prescription written, and get presented with a bill.  It will likely be somewhat larger than what you&#x27;re used to paying to see the doctor.  You can take the prescription to any pharmacy, and pay there for the antibiotics.  They will likely be more expensive than you are used to.<p>American doctors, by law and near universal custom, treat patients without regards to citizenship.",1373749068

Outside of this comparatively small population, people primarily care about other things, such as good economic growth, full employment, social equity in the sense of equality, and all sorts of things.<p>Having a forever fixed supply of money tends to be detrimental for those things.",1373749011
6038718,comment,6038680,6038680,2,0,carbocation,,,"Where you should go depends on severity of disease. If you are seriously ill, you should go to an <i>emergency department</i> at a hospital. (If you had a primary doctor in the US, they might be able to admit you directly without going through the ED if you were very ill.) If you are ill and need to be seen soon, <i>urgent care</i> centers exist and they should be able to see you quickly. If you are well enough to wait for a few days-to-weeks, then you can schedule an appointment with a doctor.<p>How it is paid for depends on insurance status. I don&#x27;t know whether your home country has national insurance, how that works once you&#x27;re in the US, or whether you personally have private insurance. If you are not insured in any way, then you could be liable for expenses.<p>Finally, it seems unlikely that a doctor would write you for antibiotics without seeing you first, but who knows.",1373748959

Even more importantly, it ingrains in the mind of the analysts  actually using these systems within the intelligence agencies, and the FISC itself, that there is that concern for eventual public disclosure.  Therefore, they should be inherently suspicious of anyone trying to avoid adding a given FISA warrant to the public disclosure list, or otherwise trying to interfere with public disclosure (such as by going around FISA).<p>And as I&#x27;ve mentioned before it would be even better if this kind of thing were <i>built-in</i> to the systems themselves so that an analyst or their supervisor couldn&#x27;t choose to &#x27;forget&#x27; to do it.",1373748956

The 8 wk study shows 12hr HFCS leading to much larger weight gain than any of the other groups, and 24hr access not being significantly different from sucrose or chow alone. But then reading the 8 wk number off the weight chart from the 6 month study shows 24hr access being ahead of 12hr access.<p>You asked if these results have been replicated anywhere--it seems like the beginning of their long study didn&#x27;t even replicate their short study. This makes me seriously skeptical about the differences they report between HFCS and sucrose.<p>The only conclusion I would feel very comfortable drawing from this data is that giving rats access to sugar water for 6 months makes them fatter (Fig. 1).

Then again, I really didn&#x27;t make launch day that big of a deal, outside of it being the first day I flipped the switch on the marketing site.<p>I&#x27;d have a LOT more customers if I knew what I know today about why people buy / don&#x27;t buy project management software, and I likely would have focused first on audience building over building a SaaS. But that&#x27;s sort of the point, right? Get something out there that people pay for, figure out why people are buying and why (more) people aren&#x27;t, and continuously improve on that. So it&#x27;s not as much of a Eureka moment that suddenly made Planscope take off as it was a lot of shots fired in a dark room, and inching up the brightness with each subsequent shot.<p>One thing that has worked really well for me: Gaining a customer through something other than my SaaS. I sell books, workshops, host a newsletter and podcast, etc. All of these are focused on making some component of a consulting business better. Planscope also helps better a few select parts of a consulting business, but has considerably higher adoption friction than a book purchase (e.g. ditching your current PM software and convincing yourself, your team, and your clients to shift somewhere else is <i>not an easy task</i>.)<p>So after someone&#x27;s &quot;entered my ecosystem&quot; and started getting value from me through information, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll discover Planscope, and by then they&#x27;ll be familiar with my consulting philosophy and have enough trust placed in me to adopt my SaaS (there&#x27;s more than a good chance, actually  there are autoresponders in place to ensure it.)<p>And the proof is in the last few months of signups: more than 60% of all new accounts come from my newsletter or have read one or more of my books, and the overwhelming majority of support requests start with &quot;Hey Brennan&quot; :-)",1373748498

the players may adapt their strategy depending on a
piece of advice. The latter is delivered to all players
by an advisor. This opens the possibility for the
players to adopt correlated strategies, which can
outperform independent strategies. There are various
forms that advice can take. For example in the case of
correlated classical advice, the advice is represented
by a classical variable, l, with prior r(l). Each player
can then choose a strategy depending on his type and
on l.</i><p>...<p><i>For Bayesian games, the possibility of having access to nonlocal correlations, for instance using entanglement, has important implications. First let us
imagine that the players can share quantum advice,
that is, the advisor is able to produce entangled particles and to send them to the players, who then perform local measurements on their particles. Since the
statistics of such measurements can in general not be
reproduced by any classical local model, the players
now have access to strategies which would be impossible in the case of a classical advisor. Thus, players
sharing quantum advice can outperform any classical
players.</i><p>So, if some players have information that other players don&#x27;t, they can outperform the others? Astonishing :-|",1373748104

It is very common in that area to talk about &quot;choice&quot; etc. while not meaning anything conscious. For example, it is acceptable to say that genes &quot;want&quot; to propagate copies of themselves, but of course this is just shorthand for something very different. In the field, this is not misunderstood, it is the norm.<p>> The study found that gender bias in birth rates can affect the number of grandchildren.<p>No, the point was that they found that gender bias in birth rates appeared to be not entirely random (50-50) and weighted towards what generates an optimal number of grandchildren. That exactly supports a hypothesis that has been around for decades that through female choice (again, choice is not meant in the sense that I can choose what to eat for lunch), animals can affect gender birth ratios in order to maximize the number of grandchildren. (Here you can see the connection to game theory.)<p>It is very hard to study that empirically, which is why this study is receiving a lot of attention - after decades, it is among the first to actually give measurements.<p>> nor do I accept their statement that the study taking place in a zoo means that their findings are somehow more likely to be present in the wild.

I&#x27;m not familiar with internal workings of core.async, so I&#x27;m looking at it from Go&#x27;s point of view.<p>Imagine that in the search example, inside the `google` function, we want to read from 100 channels. And each call to `fastest` is supplied with 100 arguments. If on average we get 100 results back in the allotted time, 900 goroutines will be left in a blocked state waiting for someone to read from their respective channel.<p>I&#x27;m guessing those goroutines are cheap and are implemented as some sort of state machine that maps to callbacks. But all those blocked goroutines should still incur runtime cost. Will the GC kick in collect those?<p>If this issue is really there (i.e. if I&#x27;m not mistaken), imagine what will become of your one-page-web-app after you click on that Search button a dozen of times.",1373746548

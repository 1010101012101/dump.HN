Some cursory searching hasn't gotten me past ""the brain uses about 20-25% of consumed energy a day,"" but that doesn't really answer my question. I acknowledge it is difficult to define when the brain is ""relaxed,"" because it's always doing <i>something</i>, but I suppose what I'd like to know is if there is a truly significant difference in energy expenditure due to intense activity or if comparatively it's just background noise because the brain is always working hard.<p>To take it to an extreme/absurd point, could thinking hard help you lose weight?<p>p.s. thanks for posting the article due to the 503",1310756390

2768607,comment,2767852,2767852,1,0,skimbrel,,,">The grammar reference section states that the only constructs allowed within a Block are Statement constructs, and that a FunctionDeclaration isnt a Statement.<p>Huh! Never knew that. I wonder what their reasoning was when they decided that. Behavior in this case is all over the map in other languages: C and Python both consider function declarations and definitions as statements, but C allows you to provide a forward declaration of a function that you define later, after invoking the function, while Python doesn't. Perl allows forward references to subroutines without a preemptive declaration; Java considers method declarations as separate grammatical entities from statements but doesn't care what order you put them in within a class; Ruby behaves similarly to Perl.<p>PHP (as always) is a total odd-man-out: it considers a function declaration to be a statement, doesn't allow forward references to functions, and it exposes nested function definitions to the current namespace as soon as the parent function has been executed once. That is, if you define a function foo() and inside its body define bar(), you can access bar() from outside of foo(), but only once you have invoked foo().",1310756367

2768588,comment,2768243,2768521,1,0,Shenglong,,,"Hey, thanks for the response. If you want some feedback:<p>Yeah, I think you should add something to not show our own profiles (I never forget who I am!). This actually reminds me of my friend's dumbphone. When he goes into his Sent Mail folder, and selects a message, and tries to add a contact (the person he send the message to), the phone tries to add his own number. While it makes sense logically, in the context it's not very useful.<p>Two other issues I have with it are on a design level for the new Compose profiles. At least in the classic theme, now the white Rapportive appears over the blue gmail send. I'm not sure how much of that you can manipulate, but shifting the blue over to the left (kind of like what's done with reply) would be preferable.<p>Also, on Reply, there's an alignment problem with the <i>Share Rapportive</i> link up top - it's slightly shifted to the right, so that it doesn't seem to align.<p>Lastly, I found a minor bug. Your <i>Share Rapportive</i> button appears fine, but I'm guessing you got rid of it (or Gmail automatically does) if the window is minimized small enough. The problem is, that it doesn't re-appear, even if you change screens. I haven't done any heavy testing on this, but the first two brief tests seem to give these results.<p>Sorry if I'm wasting your time - hopefully this helps. Send me an email if you're not sure what I mean and I'll give you some screenshots when I get home.<p>Edit: Claiming makes sense. I forget I send emails from my Gmail as more than one address. Though, can you use the emails to check via LinkedIn or something, to see if the sent user email corresponds to the same account as the original email, and if so, display the sender 1 up? Not sure how efficient that is - just brainstorming solutions since I doubt the majority of people will think to claim their emails.",1310756045

TIL.<p>According to that, the network value to an individual grows like 2^N - N - 1, which is the number of all possible subsets minus two obviously ""useless"" ones, The singletons (N) and the empty set (1). In the case of Facebook this seems to ignore plenty of other useless subsets, overestimating the value of the social network.<p>Simple example. Think about 2 of my friends that don't like each other. I would be better off with two networks, one for each. Every division I can think of leads to a new circle, so the value of a network offering circles grows more like C (2^(N-C)). This looks like its smaller than Reed's Law,  (more circles even makes it look worse!) but is actually more achievable. My Facebook network value is really more like 2^(""max number of friends with no issues""). In the worst case this leas you to a network value of N^2 which is well-served by email.<p>I'm sure somebody has thought of a more refined analysis.",1310755871

I kind of sympathize with them a little philosophically as rough individualists, but they were nasty motherfuckers as well. Brutal slavedrivers and merciless during ambushes in wartime. Again, I've actually got quite a bit of admiration of their good points and they were tough as nails, but they could really be sick bastards sometimes.

I'm bad at explaining things, because that is the point of what I wrote about the British. The British were successful not by being cutthroat but by being fair. The author characterizes such 'cooperative' strategies as ineffective, and says that they don't tend to succeed:<p>>The essence of how culture uses men depends on a basic social insecurity. This insecurity is in fact social, existential, and biological. Built into the male role is the danger of not being good enough to be accepted and respected and even the danger of not being able to do well enough to create offspring.<p>>The basic social insecurity of manhood is stressful for the men, and it is hardly surprising that so many men crack up or do evil or heroic things or die younger than women. But that insecurity is useful and productive for the culture, the system.<p>>Again, Im not saying its right, or fair, or proper. But it has worked. The cultures that have succeeded have used this formula, and that is one reason that they have succeeded instead of their rivals.<p>The Empire had lots of 'morality' and 'fairness' provisions that the societies it conquered did not. It could be said that this sense of fairness led to the loss of the Empire -- but Britain is arguably better off now than 80 years ago, whereas Mongolia is... not rich.",1310753265

2768430,comment,2767867,2767867,3,0,mitcheme,,,"What I dislike about these kinds of ""evolutionary"" arguments is that they tend to assume that the differences between the genders are genetic, even when there's no evidence for that. Even as late as the Victorian ages, several of the traits we now think of as immutable part of being male or female were swapped around. For the Victorians, blue was for girls and pink was for boys, and all women had the potential to become insatiable, incurable beasts for sex, one reason it was so important to keep chaste. This model of sexuality fit what the people experienced in their daily lives, just as ours does to us, and they had their studies that revealed women who enjoyed sex far more than was proper. Compare the here-and-now with every other culture in the history of the planet, and most of our ""innate"" traits turn out not to be. It makes it very difficult to take the ""innate"" people seriously.<p>I don't think it's that surprising that so many women are opposed to the idea that we're essentially designed to live out our whole lives hidden in the private sphere. Especially when you consider the 1950s, when (white, middle-to-upper class) women were ""free"" to do just that. They were miserable. I know I would have been miserable too. There's a reason the Feminine Mystique exists, and the 50s housewife who drowns herself in a bottle of booze is a cliche. For most people, that's just not enough to make a fulfilling life by itself. Even women today who are SAHMs have other things going on than taking care of their household, husband, and kids. He implies that it's somehow detrimental to our survival if women like me are free to create lives that don't make us deeply unhappy. If this arrangement had been as cooperative and nice as the author claims, how does feminism fit in? If we were happy inside the home, why did women look up and think, ""I want to be a CEO"" in the first place? Why did they not all look up and say, ""I'm glad I don't have to do that, it looks stressful""? Given that it was their job to take care of the CEOs and other assorted businessmen after they came home stressed from work, it's not as though they didn't realize the drawbacks. Vacuuming is just not meaningful work.<p>Guys, if you lived in a time where your choices were to latch onto a woman for financial support or pick a low-paying unskilled job, because everyone believed you were genetically incapable of doing anything better, would that be OK with you? Or would you find it personally offensive? What if they said you were incapable of making art, and labelled any creative work made by men as not art in order to reinforce that? (In the case of women, that's tapestries, embroideries, and pottery, for a start.) What if our default model of ""real"" sex was stuff women liked more than men (random, probably inaccurate example: doll up for us, dance for us, an hour of groping, grinding, and oral, PIV at the end optional), and ""all men were frigid"" because for some reason they found it less interesting than women?

You really have no control of your own destiny and have to constantly rely on a consistent flow of new clients. The better you get, the more expensive are your services. Unfortunately, web design is a commodity so you're constantly being nipped away by cheaper competitors. It feels like a bubble waiting to burst.<p>The only way out is to create a product that can be packaged and resold to many different clients. This allows you to focus and develop one product, instead of spreading your talent across multiple projects. More importantly, it allows you to control your destiny because you schedule when and how releases happen.<p>It's farming, versus hunting and gathering.",1310753077

Knowing Lamo he's got a minister certificate he bought for $25 just to say he has it. Furthermore, Manning didn't take him up on the offer and the chats certainly don't look like a minister and a worshipper talking.<p>While it's clear Lamo is double-crossing Manning and trying to suck info out of him, this bit of the chat logs don't mean anything substantively.<p>But folks like Greenwald need a nemesis, so any point to beat on Wired.com for reporting the story will work.<p>Full disclosure: I work for Wired.com and Kevin Poulsen used to be my editor, and still occasionally is.

Genes just happen; they're chemicals. Working to ensure the continuation of your genes is not mandated or valuable -- it is likely.<p>This doesn't conflict with the article at all.  The article never claims that humans have an ethical mandate to ensure the continuation of your genes.  Furthermore your statement that this behavior is _likely_ actually agrees with the article.<p>""The other obvious problem is that societies which played into the competitive heirarchy were only successful for some weird definitions of successful.<p>I don't see where the article claims competitive heirarchies are more successful.

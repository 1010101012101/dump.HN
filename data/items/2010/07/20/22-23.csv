For comparison, Harvard's rate is 6.9% (2).<p>I'm just realizing that besides launching early, working hard, iterating rapidly, listening to your customers, persevering, etc, a big part of success in business seems to be <i>selection</i>: having the discipline and patience to pick the best deals. Deals can involve physical trades (as in the posted article), investments, customers, or even tasks to do. Whatever your process is, a good way to make your outputs above average is to select above-average inputs.<p>It seems obvious that the way to trade up from a phone to a Porsche is to carefully select your trades. It's not so obvious, at least to me, that the way to run a very profitable YCombinator is to carefully select your founders. Simple selection may be more important than locating in Silicon Valley, having regular dinners with great speakers, offering legal and technical help, and introducing investors. When you start off with great entrepreneurs it's not so hard to make them even better.<p>I'm naturally a believer in transformation.\n* If the trade as advertised is not a good deal, let's negotiate and we'll make it work.\n* If a person is not a good entrepreneur, that can be fixed with the right training program and environment.\n* If the product is not right for this customer, we'll add features and cut the price until it is right.\n* If a person has the wrong political beliefs, what is needed is some good logical argument.<p>This sometimes works, but it is often more efficient to simply look for a better deal: Find someone with a better trade; find someone who's more entrepreneurial, find a customer with more of a need, find a voter who already agrees with you.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2007/sb20070926_620433_page_2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2007/sb20070...</a>. \n2. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/31/financial-aid-percent-students/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/31/financial-aid-pe...</a>",1279666496

1533691,comment,1532670,1532670,0,0,1053r,,,"This currency suffers from the same major problem that all limited supply commodity-based currencies have (assuming someone doesn't figure out a way to counterfeit it) - deflation.  Whether your fixed money supply is based upon gold or hard cryptographic problems, a fixed money supply encourages people to hoard money rather than invest it, because their money will be worth more later.  This causes the amount of money in circulation to fall, which causes even more deflation, etc.  (Google for ""deflationary spiral"").<p>Basically, you have 3 choices for currency.  You can have debt-money (most modern economies).  This has the advantage that money is effectively created by the market based upon the mutual agreement of a lender and a borrower, which means that money is created and destroyed by the invisible hand.  This is a good thing.  It is problematic, however, in that you get problems if large sections of the economy ever start paying off their debts through very large productivity gains because that destroys the money supply.  Also, it tends to support a ""banker class"", who does nothing but loan money and gets paid for very little work (capital allocation isn't THAT hard compared to how much you make doing it).<p>You can have commodity money, which is great because you don't get runaway inflation.  But because of deflationary spirals, you can get runaway deflation.  Also, people tend to hoard whatever commodities you are using, which are typically useful for industrial or other uses.<p>You can have fiat money, but that only works if you have an incorruptible central bank.  Otherwise you end up like Nigeria.<p>Personally, I think we should use the Joule as a basic unit of currency.  Although energy supplies can fluctuate, they tend to grow and shrink with the economy, which prevents either inflation or deflation.  Different banks could offer different baskets of energy types (wind farm or solar farm output futures, barrels of oil, coal, etc.), and you don't end up with a banker class living off of everyone else, but you don't end up with hyperinflation or deflation.  500 MJ today would tend to buy a similar amount of things 10 years from now as today (maybe a little more because of efficiency gains, but not a lot more).",1279665097

Both are native erlang apps, speak http natively and use map/reduce as a primary mechanism of retrieving data.<p>riak is just about 1 years old from an open source perspective but is in use in a few production environments and had been in development a few yrs before going open source, afaik. What I like most about riak is the 'no special node' feature and the very close adherence to amazon's dynamo lineage. easy scale up - and easy scale down. adherence to dynamo also means you can fine tune your r/w/n values at a granular level. beyond that, the fact that you can do virtually everything there is to do in riak over http is fantastic. other access pathways are erlang client and protobuffs. another major feature of riak is that you can link keys together with link headers. admin wise, riak is very simple to get up and running either in a dev environment or production.<p>the drawbacks against riak are that there is no ordering of keys, no select * keys, no select range. listing all keys is expensive. you almost have to keep your own internal index of keys if you want to maintain performance over m/r jobs in any sort of realtime fashion.<p>im glossing over lots of finer points but if you have specific questions the irc is well manned and so is the mailing list.",1279664525

Yes, it all begins with an idea but that idea takes tangible form at some point and it takes money, work, and ingenuity to give it that tangible form. And, while our minds can freely conceive away at the idea stage, it takes a lot more than that to execute. When we do, we create value. If the law does not protect that value for its creator, everybody suffers.<p>Take a fictional animated character. Pixar's <i>Toy Story</i> characters all no doubt had limited value as mere abstractions when first proposed but today have enormous value after having appeared in several hit movies, having been made larger-than-life by imaginative scripting, and having been powered by mega-marketing dollars into vivid images that millions of people can identify and relate to.<p><i>Someone</i> can and will profit from the value embodied by those animated characters.<p>If it were not for the protections of copyright law, the creators of those characters would be robbed of the value of what they have created. The thousands of hours of work they put into developing the story lines, into shaping the animations, and into the countless other tasks that took years to accomplish would ultimately be diluted or wasted at any time that any knock-off artist decided to take those same characters and exploit them commercially as his own. And, without copyright protection, any person would be free to do so. He could not only distribute unauthorized versions of the movies themselves but he could also <i>make</i> his own movies (or books, commercials, or whatever) based on those exact same characters.<p>Copyright law blocks such efforts and gives he owner of the copyright the exclusive right to exploit the creations he has made, both as embodied in existing works and as used in future derivative works.<p>Without copyright, every fictional creation would be up for grabs by anybody without any accountability to the original creator. This would apply to books as well. Anybody could do a <i>Harry Potter</i> book and seek to exploit the value built up by the author of that character. Conceivably, there could even be thousands of books about that character, to the point where the value of the original was so diluted as to be destroyed. No one could control the quality because no one has any rights to the intangible property represented by that character. It is all shared. Everybody owns it and nobody does. This means, of course, that no matter how much time, effort, money, and ingenuity that someone invested to make something valuable in a work of fiction, that value could be taken or destroyed by anybody who had a mind to want to try to capitalize on it.<p>I think such a system would be deeply unfair to creators of such works. It took a lot for them to give their ideas value. That value should be protected and not be exposed to misappropriation or destruction just because it is now easy to make copies of tangible embodiments of their creative efforts.<p>I will grant that this is not all one-sided. IP rights have been abused, and often badly so. The ludicrous extensions of copyright terms for the benefit of Disney are but one of a host of examples.<p>But the world <i>would</i> be more chaotic <i>and</i> more unfair if those who create intangible value have no way under law to protect that value for themselves. IP protections give them that ability. To abolish such protections would have many and varied consequences, most of them bad for those who take great ideas and give them great implementations.",1279664205

Any type of optimization is kind of a tricky thing because you can't predict what the user is going to do in the field. Take sorting algorithms, for example. Quicksort can degenerate to O(n^2) if you lay your elements to be sorted out in a specific order which will always have bad pivots. I'm not sure if you are familiar with C and x86 assembly, but the test harness code was linked to in the article. It is a contrived example specifically designed to beat gcc's optimization.",1279663283

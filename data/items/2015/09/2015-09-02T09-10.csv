They have to algorithms doing machine learning on the market, a decision tree and a deep neural net. Over time they can see that the neural net outperforms the decision tree, yet they cannot use the results to advise customers because it is a black box.<p>Why should you buy this investment? &quot;Because the computer said so&quot; isn`t an answer that makes it sound like you know what you are talking about.",1441187911

10158231,comment,10157729,10158116,0,0,logicchains,,,">It is safe to say, that the economic theory a person subscribes to is highly related to their income.<p>This is an overly pessimistic view that ignores the philosophical aspects of economics. E.g. I lived on under $15k per year for a couple of years before I moved into software development, but during that time I still supported a very liberal approach to economics. This is because I hate violence (I can&#x27;t even bring myself to crush spiders that wander into the house), and view redistributive economics as necessarily violent, as in a roundabout way it&#x27;s forcing people to give goods/services/tokens of exchange to me that they may not want to give (since they&#x27;re forced to give it via taxation lest they face imprisonment, I cannot assume it&#x27;s voluntary). Other people may not care so much about this and take a more utilitarian approach, focusing on maximising some particular metrics (such as GDP or income equality), so they&#x27;ll reach different conclusions.<p>Assuming people subscribe solely to the theories (economic or otherwise) that maximise the financial benefit to them is ironically a rather economics-style view of the world, and I&#x27;m fortunate enough to say that most of the people I&#x27;m close to don&#x27;t fit this characterisation.<p>In terms of actual data, there&#x27;s a correlation, but it&#x27;s far from being the strongest factor: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/11/does-your-wage-predict-your-vote/264541/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/11/does-you...</a>",1441187057

There&#x27;s also possible wireless charging support, and the Skylake integrated GPU possibly has double the speed of the Haswell Iris chips.",1441184853

The worst economic period since the Great Depression arguably. The rich getting ever richer. Real wages for most people stagnating or falling. Massive unemployment and under-employment. Quantitative Easing not creating real jobs and fixing infrastructure. Low interest rates (still!) Multinational corporations with so much money through tax evasion schemes that they literally don&#x27;t know what to spend it on. The ongoing privatisation of public services which rarely if ever benefits the public. Essentially, ongoing class warfare and levels of inequality not seen in practically a century. Regulatory and political capture and political collusion. Trade agreements on the horizon being negotiated in secret that would exacerbate every issue already mentioned.<p>And you say Krugman has wandered off reservation? Rubbish. He&#x27;s got to keep banging the same drum because nothing&#x27;s getting fixed.",1441184723

Ants are fascinating creatures, I used to spend hours as a kid watching them build their nests or raid a termite colony...<p>And although I agree with many of the other posters here that one has to be extremely careful with biological pest control when using imported species, I still think that on the whole this approach is definitely better than poisoning the ecosystem with chemicals.

KDFs can normally produce arbitrary lengths of output, and don't need to be fast -- in fact, being fast is a disadvantage, since secure KDFs are expensive to compute (because they need to resist brute-force attacks).",1241963826

602099,comment,601439,601439,0,0,geebee,,,"This article, or a variant of it, has been posted many, many times over the past few weeks.  I usually chime in.  I point out that 7 of the top 10 users of the H1B visa are Indian outsourcing companies that cycle workers through the US to learn a job before moving them back to India, and I provide a link.  I express concern that the high number of visas may be discouraging young Americans from going into engineering and science at a time when we need them most.  I link to an NPR segment with Ron Hira, where he mentions that the department of labor certified the prevailing wage at under $10/hr for a bunch of programmers, and another 70+ programmers at $24,000/yr.  I've done this an embarrassing number of times now, though I am passionate about the issue, as I do think US policy is inadvertently driving young Americans out of engineering, and I think this is exactly whey we're in this situation where 60% of our grads<p>My question at this point is: how many people reading this are encountering a variant of this post for the first time?  Are we all just gathering for a well-worn argument.<p>Part of the problem here is the concept of ""news priming"".  This is done by PR departments and political groups - prior to a lobbying or legislative initiative, they'll try to frame the issue in the public mind.  This is why the proponents of the H1B tried to get it termed the ""innovation visa"" (and probably weren't happy when India's minister of commerce called it the ""outsourcing visa."")<p>And of course, many people here are passionate about the issue - on both sides, of course, so we jump in to make sure we are part of the ""priming.""  But I am curious - how many people here are surprised with anything in my post?  I'm starting to suspect that most people on hacker news are pretty well informed about this by now.",1241962900

602097,comment,600968,601072,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>the girls were adequately treated</i><p>Did you even read the Wikipedia link you cited? The one which says this:<p><i>Conditions in the Lowell mills were severe by modern American standards. Employees worked from five am until seven pm, for an average 73 hours per week. Each room usually had 80 women working at machines, with two male overseers managing the operation. The noise of the machines was described by one worker as ""something frightful and infernal"", and although the rooms were hot, windows were often kept closed during the summer so that conditions for thread work remained optimal. The air, meanwhile, was filled with particles of thread and cloth.</i><p><i>About 25 women lived in each boardinghouse, with up to six sharing a bedroom. One worker described her quarters as ""a small, comfortless, half-ventilated apartment containing some half a dozen occupants""...</i><p><i>Women were also given opportunities to attend concerts and lectures, in addition to experiencing city life. Still, at least one observer reported that most women worked so that a male relative could obtain an education. ""I have known more than one to give every cent of her wages,"" she writes, ""month after month, to her brother, that he might get the education necessary to enter some profession.""</i><p>Yeah, I guess this is more than adequate by the standards of a slave. Which is exactly Chomsky's point -- and the point of the contemporary writers and labor organizers which he is citing:<p><i>The Lowell girls' organizing efforts were notable not only for the ""unfeminine"" participation of women, but also for the political framework used to appeal to the public. Framing their struggle for shorter work days and better pay as a matter of rights and personal dignity, they sought to place themselves in the larger context of the American Revolution. During the 1834 ""turn-out"" or strike – they warned that ""the oppressing hand of avarice would enslave us,""...</i>",1241962762

602084,comment,601439,601439,0,0,rdl,,,"I think everyone (except maybe self-interested immigration lawyers) thinks the current system in the US is broken.<p>I think there are two extremes, and the US is inconsistently taking pieces of each.<p>In the United Arab Emirates (UAE, which contains Dubai, ...), there is a fairly open work visa policy for anyone with either enough capital ($50-100k) to set up his own business, or with a job offer paying at least $1-2k/mo for white collar positions (there is also the borderline-slavery $100-500/mo construction industry, but I think that is basically a separate issue).  There is no pretense, outside banking and government, that local nationals need to be given first shot at a job.<p>Then, you have countries with citizenship or permanent residency-track-only immigration programs.   (I think Canada's program is like this, and some other commonwealth nations.)  You don't NEED to become a PR or citizen if you qualify, but almost all work visas qualify toward the PR/C process.<p>The main downside of the UAE system is that skilled people feel very little long-term attachment to the place.  e.g. there are non-resident indian families who have lived for generations in UAE, but who are not permanent residents, although they control important businesses.<p>The US has a weird hybrid system, where most green cards, allocated by country and with preference toward reuniting families, go to people who have external reasons to want to stay in the US permanently (family, where they came from was worse, etc), and are generally economically non-productive.  We give temporary L1/H1B/etc. visas to the economically productive, disincenting them to stay long term.<p>Basically, the US system is backward -- we should be trying to keep the people who are economically valuable, as they bring net value into the economy, and would allow us to increase the number of immigrants.  We should have liberal short and medium term visit visas, etc. for family and tourist and other non-productive immigrants.",1241961412

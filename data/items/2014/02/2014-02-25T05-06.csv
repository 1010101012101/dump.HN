7295943,comment,7295094,7295094,37,0,lukev,,,"This is very interesting (and as has been pointed out in other comments, not exactly a new idea). I think its proper application, though, is in a tool for practicing reading, not for actually reading tests.<p>One major thing this approach looses is the inherent non-linearity of text. If I miss a fact and want to back up a bit, or want to pause for a moment and think about something, I can (when reading) without even thinking about it. Even if this approach is faster overall, it makes reading more like listening to audio or watching a video; it&#x27;s a big pain to rewind or pause.<p>Secondly, this is actually <i>slower</i> than true speed reading or skimming because it <i>forces</i> you to read every word. Truly accomplished readers will often read material at a very superficial level, only dipping in and reading consistently when they encounter a novel concept. Essentially, they can use <i>semantic compression</i> to increase their reading speed by only bothering to read what they find to be relevant. This operates on every level, from the page to the chapter to the paragraph to the sentence. It isn&#x27;t perfect, of course, but it&#x27;s always possible to back up if one finds crucial information has been missed.<p>Finally, even though this tool is truly <i>excellent</i> for breaking the subvocalization habit that hampers most slow readers, once you learn how to read without subvocalizing it becomes a bit redundant. For example, looking at Spritz, I cranked the speed to 500. It felt pretty good, like I was reading fast. Then I went and took a traditional reading speed test and clocked in at 700wpm, with 95% comprehension. So I&#x27;m not sure my overall speed is better with Spritz.<p>That said, I&#x27;ll probably keep coming back to this or technologies like this, now that I&#x27;m aware of them. They seem a really good way to force oneself into the speed-reading mindset - I have a feeling that doing this for 60 seconds before a normal reading session would improve reading speed substantially.",1393307979
7295942,comment,7295094,7295374,2,0,grogenaut,,,"the big thing when speed reading is to read it, just read it. Your brain will churn on it. Then come back and read it again. Your brain will churn more. Make notations in the margin the whole time. Now finally read it again. You&#x27;ll get it all done faster than one read through and your brain will churn a ton on it. It&#x27;s like when you come back to code tutorials a few days later after some practice and know what&#x27;s going on a bit more and get further.<p>Then go back and read your notations (just put ticks or dots by the stuff that&#x27;s important in the margins). And now you understand it and you can summarize it in the notes. And this cements the learning.<p>Of course this is a lot of work. I&#x27;d rather slam it once, brain index it and maybe come back if I care.",1393307958

If the value of btc collapses and people make a run on it, those other exchanges will likely be able to cover the bid/ask spread in any case because by and large they are merely mediating exchanges of $/btc that other people are holding.<p>3) the &#x27;rational world&#x27; was meant to apply to the rate at which bitcoin recovers.  In a rational world it would be instantaneous, we&#x27;re not.  It&#x27;s certainly possible that bitcoin will go to zero as a result of this, but I treat that as a separate case.  If you think that bitcoin will survive in the medium-term, my point is the resulting value should be higher than before Mt Gox.  In a &#x27;rational world&#x27; everyone would figure this out tomorrow, for certain values of irrationality it takes longer for this to suss out, and for extreme values, it goes to zero too fast.",1393307910

Similarly, we could make it illegal for an employer to request access to any private information before hiring someone. That seems reasonable.

It was an illusion, of course, generated by Clevinger&#x27;s predilection for staring fixedly at one side of a question and never seeing the other side at all. Politically, he was a humanitarian who did know right from left and was trapped uncomfortably between the two. He was constantly defending his Communist friends to his right-wing enemies, and his right-wing friends to his Communist enemies, and he was thoroughly detested by both groups, who never defended him to anyone because they thought he was a dope. He was a very serious, very earnest and very conscientious dope. It was impossible to go to a movie with him without getting involved afterwards in a discussion on empathy, Aristotle, universals, messages and the obligations of the cinema as an art form in a materialistic society. Girls he took to the theater had to wait until the first intermission to find out from him whether or not they were seeing a good or a bad play, and then found out at once.

There are a lot of unfortunate Catch-22s sprinkled around our bureaucracies.<p>The impression I got from your question wasn&#x27;t that homeless people were incapable of intelligence, but rather that you thought intelligence was the exception, rather than the rule. This becomes a problem when, say, a rags-to-riches story comes around and people conclude not that this one person got a lucky break, but that this one person decided to stop being as stupid as the others. This in turn suggests that nothing is actually broken and homelessness is less an indicator of societal malfunction and more a casual nuisance.",1393304674

It&#x27;s harder to ignore such questions when they compose 99% of the content source you&#x27;re interested in, without ignoring the entire source - including the 1% of signal you care about.  We <i>are</i> certainly running out of mental bandwidth all the time, even if you aren&#x27;t counting them as bits.<p>This sort of community moderation exists in an attempt to proactively ensure a high signal to noise ratio (SNR), by discouraging noise.  While it&#x27;s an entirely valid stance to say they&#x27;re overreacting and that the ratio is fine, that there&#x27;s no slippery slope, etc., here&#x27;s another viewpoint:<p>I don&#x27;t read from the raw Stack Overflow firehose of posts.  It doesn&#x27;t even have a 1% SNR to me.  Higher SNR sources (searches, specific links from my communities) will occasionally take me there, but as a primary source of information I don&#x27;t even think of consulting it.  I took a stab at participating in one of the far more niche subtopics - gamedev, relevant to me both professionally and unprofessionally - and still found it didn&#x27;t have a high enough SNR to hold my interest beyond gathering a few hundred internet points.  I found myself ignoring the majority of these sorts of questions, and quickly progressed to the natural conclusion of ignoring the site entirely.<p>And that&#x27;s fine: Not everything is for everyone.  But there are presumably those who still participate in the site directly who would prefer to remain doing so, yet find the SNR low enough to be pushing their own tolerances.",1393304664

I don&#x27;t think history sets a good precedent for predicting the future, especially in this current environment.  At no point in history have we had robots and AI.  We still don&#x27;t have that now, and there are no guarantees that we will fully achieve AI, but in many areas we are making humans obsolete and I expect this trend to continue.  Using your eariler analogy, what happened to the horses after Ford introduced mass produced cars?  They were turned to glue.  In many ways, this is the issue we are currently facing.<p>I do agree that highly skilled and entrepreneurial folks will create new industries which could dramatically alter the economic landscape, but I am still not convinced that this is going to result in full employment.  These new industries will still be taking advantage of the highly automated and efficient technologies that other industries use and lower-skilled and less educated people are going to find it increasingly difficult to find work.",1393304504

They put a lot of money into acquiring those Bitcoins. They are going to actually end up a significant fraction of that $600k worse of than when they started.

They put a lot of money into acquiring those Bitcoins, and are going to end up a significant fraction of that $600k behind where they started. That represents a significant fraction of their wealth, and it will impact future plans to live a more extravagant lifestyle, but it won&#x27;t knock them down to a lower class. They&#x27;ll keep living where they live, and buying the same kind of luxuries they currently buy.<p>4. Similar to 2 and 3, but they had most of their wealth in this.

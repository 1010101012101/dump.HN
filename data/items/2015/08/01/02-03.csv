Anything that&#x27;s still around is just rotting on the outskirts of internet. When was the last time anyone heard of YUI?

9985635,comment,9983204,9983723,0,0,spion,,,"PureScript is a very principled pure functional language with a design based on Haskell but adapted to be compatible with JS (it adds extensible records, which are a great fit for JS objects). The type system should really pay itself off in the long run in terms of significantly lowering the cost of refactoring pretty much anything [1]<p>Additionally, I find that algebraic data types are by far the most natural and complete way to model your data and pattern matching is a powerful way to write succinct and readable code that manipulates that data. The fact that Lisps don&#x27;t normally come with ADTs (incl. clojure) is a real shame.<p>PureScript got its own Hoogle [2] recently. It lets you search for functions by stating their argument and result types. This has worked far better for me than any IntelliSense, and its miles ahead compared to rummaging through the docs of a dynamic language hoping to hit a jackpot.<p>Although the community is small, the speed at which the language and its libraries are moving is quite amazing. For the cases where a package doesn&#x27;t yet exist, its very easy to write FFI bindings to an existing JS library<p>On the minus side, there is no &quot;template purescript&quot; yet, and generic deriving is WIP, so some things (like JSON serialization) are still a bit more tedious than absolutely necessary.<p>The efficiency of the generated code may also be a concern. For example, currying is implemented in such a way that a function call with 3 arguments always generates both the result and 2 temporary JS closures. This can be very costly in certain situations. I find that library documentation is also sometimes lacking, however types and typeclasses do help with that somewhat (the latter only once you learn what each typeclass means).<p>Finally, something to keep in mind if coming from JavaScript: unless you know Haskell the learning curve for PureScript is far steeper than ClojureScript. Its about as steep as Haskell&#x27;s. There is a great book available to help with that [3], and almost all of the the knowledge gained there will easily transfer to Haskell. Since PureScript compiles to readable JS, looking at the compiled code made it much easier for me to understand the mechanics of certain features (Eff <-> thunks in particular was quite a revelation) which in turn helped me understand those features<p>I haven&#x27;t used ClojureScript much, but it does seem to have more mature, battle-tested persistent data structures (vs purescript-maps) and UI library (om vs purescript-halogen, although halogen seems very promising). There is also a type system (core.typed) which while not as principled as PureScript&#x27;s, its still amazingly expressive - and since its gradual, you can start fully dynamic and then add types whenever you feel like doing that to parts of the codebase.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3e10ea/til_instantwatcher_is_made_with_haskell/ctavz2m"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3e10ea/til_instant...</a> - last paragraph also applies to PureScript<p>[2]: <a href=""http://pursuit.purescript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pursuit.purescript.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://leanpub.com/purescript/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/purescript/</a>",1438396257

A clean F-16? That&#x27;s going to be hard to beat even by a lot of combat UAVs. An F-16 with a usable combat load of bombs and A2A missiles? Yes, the F-35 has comparable maneuverability to this configuration of F-16, AND it carries all that ordnance and fuel internally, maintaining stealth. Check out the maneuverability section of this excellent resource for more info: <a href=""https://comprehensiveinformation.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://comprehensiveinformation.wordpress.com/</a><p>3) Does the cannon fire reliably and with enough ammunition to do its jobs?<p>In ground tests, yes, it does well.

In a fort, you go through a security rotation of making sure the pot of boiling oil tips over on time. You practice your smoke signaling so that the appropriate people are notified in the event of a wall breach. You measure your walls and review their height periodically. You protect transports carrying crown jewels. But the only way to make sure all these worked effectively was to write down their processes down and practice them.<p>You need a systematic checklist to control your sensitive environment and protect your fort. In an agile environment, keeping all the processes in your head is painful. By prescribing to a series of security rotations (e.g. Code review process, Change control process, Log review process, Key Rotation process, Secure Delete process) you can provide accountability that reasonable steps were taken to build your fort and protect your crown jewels.<p>1. Boundary Control (e.g. Firewall, Router, Switch)<p>2. System Hardening (e.g. Chef, Puppet)<p>3. Data Storage (e.g. SAN, File Servers)<p>4. Data Encryption (e.g. VPN, TLS, SSH)<p>5. Malware Protection (e.g. App Isolation Containers)<p>6. Source Code Analysis (e.g. Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Code Coverage, Linting, Code Formatting, Brakeman)<p>7.

9332686,comment,9332097,9332380,0,0,Athas,,,"I got a ThinkPad X250 a few weeks ago.  Originally I was hesitant, as it is also limited to 8GiB of memory, but I realised that development need not actually use more than that (and indeed, I never do).  I basically need to run just Emacs, a compiler and a browser, and although both GHC and browsers are memory hogs, 8GiB is plenty.  Whenever I need to do really intense things, like benchmarking, simulations or large-scale testing, I always want to use a remote beefy machine anyway.<p>I know that some developers have a need to run a large number of local virtual machines, but I do not really understand why, to be honest.  I use virtual machines too, but remotely, and mostly automatically for continuous integration.<p>I don&#x27;t think programming is inherently particularly resource-consuming.",1428397076

9332673,comment,9327637,9332390,0,0,mdekkers,,,"> I think it&#x27;s too early for you to think about Kub in production by the sounds of it.<p>Maybe this is getting lost in translation, but I find this line to be somewhat condescending. I am asking for some hint as to where I can find documentation that goes beyond &quot;here, run the docker/vagrant/VM image, and have fun&quot; - I want to know what is what, which pieces talk to which pieces, and how. I specifically not asking &quot;Is this ready for production&quot; which is a decision I am happy to make for myself, on the basis of the research I hope to do.<p>Just to be clear: I am an (admittedly increasingly unfashionable) infrastructure guy. I am pretty sure that if I follow your examples, I can get something up and running that allows me to feed some DSL into some tool, and have a running set of containers. Not interesting to me. I am happy to believe that this works, and am happy to take people&#x27;s word for it.<p>I want to know and learn about required infrastructure, about failure domains, about networking requirements, about load and overhead, and ultimately, about &quot;If I build something like this, what are going to be the issues in making sure it will never go down&quot;. I see a lot of high-level architecture, which appears to segue quite suddenly into &quot;now do magic, and here is how you then start a pod&quot;. I am asking about this in between stage, as I have been unable to find this.<p>> This whole area is still in the early stages; any documentation you see on specifics are likely to be soon out of date.<p>I would expect any documentation to be at least somewhat relevant to the version it is released with. It isn&#x27;t important for us to be on the latest greatest - it is important for us to know and understand how the stuff we use behaves and is to be operated, especially in failure modes. If my only recourse during a failure is &quot;well, lets try to restart a container running something critical and lets see if the problem goes away&quot; then indeed it isn&#x27;t ready for anything other than being a toy.<p>I do see the likes of Kismatic and now tectonic making moves to run this as a production system, so somewhere, somehow, it would be possible to stand up a system that has not had all the key decisions made for you, and would allow you to build something that is ready for a particular environment.<p>Kismatic have actually released some packages that appear helpful in pulling the pieces apart and I will be looking at those to get a better understanding of what does what.<p>> To quote the kub github page: &quot;Kubernetes is in pre-production beta!<p>Yeah, I saw that, thanks... From the perspective of the Kubernetes team &quot;pre-production&quot; likely means that they have not yet evaluated many probable edge-cases for many different use-types. This is important to them, not so much for me. What is important for me is that <i>my</i> workload works. It is a lot easier and faster for me to test this (and feed back the results, thus helping the project towards production status) on the basis of an infrastructure I know and understand than it is for me to try and put together something something [magic] and trying to figure out stuff isn&#x27;t working. Case in point: I followed one of the VMware install guides. at the &quot;now run this image, and xyz will happen&quot; nothing happened. No reasonable possibility of troubleshooting, as the image in question was/is a black box, and no documentation I could find, outside of the &quot;invoke these magic incantations&quot;.<p>To be very honest, I am not too bothered - there are plenty of viable alternatives that do the same / similar things. We are evaluating a large list of possible environments, and kube got crossed off the list pretty quickly, which is a pity as it looks interesting.",1428396765

A law enforcement policy is one where, if you&#x27;re sitting at your desk, and the government thinks you&#x27;ve hacked into someone&#x27;s computer, the government throws you in jail.<p>This executive order has <i>nothing</i> to do with domestic law enforcement, like Aaron Swartz or Kevin Mitnick or Dread Pirate Roberts or whatever. It is a <i>foreign policy</i> decision. The US maintains a public list, called the SDN list, of <i>foreign</i> entities that American citizens and companies aren&#x27;t allowed to do business with. These are normally agents of governments the US doesn&#x27;t like, eg. Iran and North Korea. This order adds hacking to the list of reasons why the President can put an entity on the SDN list. If, say, a Chinese defense contractor started hacking into American computers, the President can now prohibit American businesses from trading with them.<p>Under this order, the <i>only</i> way you can go to jail (that you couldn&#x27;t go to jail for before) is if a) the President suspects some foreign person or company (say, a Chinese defense contractor) of hacking; b) the President decides to put that company on the SDN list; c) you <i>know</i> that company is now on the SDN list; and d) you buy things from, sell things to, or otherwise do commercial business with that company.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bad idea for the executive to have the power to add people to the SDN list without judicial oversight.

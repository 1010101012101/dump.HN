People with money who learn that it doesn't convey lasting meaning will inevitably look for it elsewhere.",1211702388

199417,comment,198964,198964,0,0,tdavis,,,"All this discussion makes me think that if someone were to create, say, a Firefox plug-in for accessibility -- one that could react to Javascript-related DOM changes and such -- there would be a serious market for it.<p>Of course, if web developers would stop being lazy and properly implement things like progressive enhancement and graceful degradation, it wouldn't be needed. Every site I make starts as non-Javascript, even if I plan for the entire thing to be laden with it in the end.<p>Then again, all of this is moot anyway, because the author gave absolutely no reasons for why he prefers the HTML version and doesn't use the JS version. I am going to run with the idea that he fears <i>JAVASCRIPT GNOMES!!!</i>",1211701782

The author's childhood and parenthood, as described in the essay, provide at least one example that it can work.",1211701527

Smart people can learn about data structures and algorithms.  Slow people who've managed to get a CS degree from some random college may have learned enough to pass, but there's no demonstration of smarts there.<p>I'm hiring based on people being smart, self-motivated, willing to learn, willing to think, and people I can hold a conversation with.  Teaching someone like that how data structures work is a lot easier than teaching a degree holder how to be someone I want to work with and someone I can trust to be on the ball as new technologies come out.",1211701376

Otherwise, you ARE influencing them.<p>I'm not saying whether or not it is possible to not answer the question when a child asks you one. I'm not saying you SHOULDN'T answer the question. But if you do not want to influence a child's thought patters in any given situation you have to not say anything (though likely silence will also influence them in some way as well). Hence why I said, ""There is no right answer to this question"".<p>""This dramatic influence-avoidance thing seems pretty ridiculous.""<p>yes, it is ridiculous, which is why we lie to kids, because we have to give them some answer they will be satisfied with. There is no way to NOT lie to kids and not be pretty ridiculous.",1211700580

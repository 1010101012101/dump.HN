In China, the contract you sign is just a place to start negotiations and the prototype that they first present to you is considered a loose guide to how they will build the actual product.<p>As time wears on and numbers increase, you'll find all sorts of tweaks to save a penny or two showing up on your latest batches.

Because the iPad 3 (?) has x4 the pixels of the iPad 2, half-speed seems expected (if using full resolution).  The same thing happened for the first iPhone retina display, so not that surprising.

It's terrible.<p>I got fed up with trying to use it, so I looked at the HTML and decided that it was easy enough to parse. I made the deliberate decision to link to the original job descriptions so that you'd still have to log in to find any real information about the jobs. However, a listing of {employer,job title,location} seemed harmless enough.<p>I wrote it such that it ran once and spat out a static HTML file so that it wouldn't be constantly accessing the original server. Then I hosted it on my university account and told people about it via Twitter. I had no intention of hiding it; I wanted it to help people! Also, I posted the scraping script (which required a university account to login before it could run) on GitHub for others to use or improve. Y'know.<p>A few days later, my account had been disabled! When I went to see the people in charge, they told me that I was violating their copyright and since I has posted my code to scrape, they considered me to be a malicious hacker. They also said that I could have single-handedly taken down the co-op program at the university.<p>For my formal response, I learned some obscure details about Canadian copyright law (like what I posted in the grandparent), and took the opportunity to educate the administrators on hacker culture (with the help of Eric Raymond). I also made sure to explain the implications of my script (runs only once, requires a login, links to the actual copyrighted works). Oh, and I used some of my connections with IT security and professors as character reference.<p>In the end, they decided to punish me for reproducing their data (which the login screen technically prohibits, but it's unrealistic- having the page in memory is a reproduction!) by making me take a business ethics course, which was actually a fun and interesting course. No criminal charges, no expulsion/suspension. I figured it wasn't too bad, though I would have appreciated an apology for essentially calling me a terrorist. ;)",1331250076

    officials can see, and dont provide enough added security to justify this.) Which

After fixing the problem he asked the QA people why they put it into production that quickly while missing such a basic issue was not discovered.  Their response, we stopped testing your code a few years ago and this is the first problem that's showed up.

3682150,comment,3680208,3680208,2,0,dirkdeman,,,"Man, I wish I had your focus when I was in high school! I chose a different career path, then chose another, only to roll in the tech scene by accident. But you know what: I don't regret the choices I made, they all taught me valuable things, insights, ideas. I believe it was John Lennon who said 'life is what happens to you while you're making plans for it', so don't worry about your future path too much.<p>As for advices:
University: in my opinion, universities build networks, not knowledge. If you get in a good uni, by all means go for it. If you don't, there are other ways to build a network.
How to move to a big city: easy. Just do it. Don't obsess about the details, just go with the flow.
How to get an interesting job: all jobs are interesting at first, especially your first job. No matter where you'll end up for your first job, I guarantee you you'll learn more in the first two months than four years in uni. Not just knowledge, but stuff they don't teach you in school. Like coffee-machine politics, interhuman relations, understanding how a business works.
How to start a company: start-fail-repeat.<p>As for success: that word means something different to anyone. To me, it's not about money, the car you drive or the size of your company. To me, success means freedom, doing stuff I love to do, caring for my family.<p>So go on, work your way through college, participate in extracurricular activities (tech and non-tech), keep an open mind but most of all: enjoy the ride.",1331247924

Your target audience is really 2 bases: fans and bands. 
For the fans: maybe track which band or what venue gets the most clicks? 
For the bands: maybe provide a resource on how to tour for bands... like a google maps plot of previous tours of other bands... which venues treat bands the best (sort of like yelp)?",1331247761

But you've to tread carefully. <p>I've observed there are always two kinds of entrepreneurial stories: <p>1) well organized entrepreneur with a vision he lays out and then goes out and executes(characteristic of older, more experienced entrepreneurs) <p>2) entrepreneur playing around with stuff without much of a goal and happens to hit something which he develops into something even better (ie. hotornot, facebook).<p>My point: there is an extreme to both. That doesn't mean I don't value planning and goal a lot. In my case, clear goals make the actual doing that much more fun and give me that ""on a mission"" feel.",1181553489

5796574,comment,5795954,5795954,0,0,TerraHertz,,,"Personally I don't think Microsoft's primary agenda is to produce user-enabling products. Imo their desire is to produce user-hobbling products; products that slow down or preferably reverse the knowledge-empowering potential of computing machines for the average person. It's a political not marketing objective, and you'll never see them admitting to it. You have to analyze their actions not their words to see it.<p>If you assume Microsoft has always been trying to achieve the 'best' product possible, then their development history looks like incredible incompetence. If you view it in the political context of Elites trying to cripple development of 'computing power to the people', it makes perfect sense and reveals a high degree of sophistication in the Microsoft inner management group.<p>Effectively their strategy is to steer development of their products in the most socially harmful direction possible, constantly pushing the boundary of what the market will reject as 'too stupid'. When they hit public resistance, they wait as long as possible then back off with a slightly less stupid product release. Once that version has become entrenched they then try again with something even more stupid. Windows 8 was just an example of MS pushing a little too hard.",1369968293

LinkedIn is something I do not use. At this point, I just auto-accept all contacts and never check it. I know Airbnb uses my Facebook connections to show my friends that I've stayed at a particular place.  That, to me, is fine. But, most of my LinkedIn connections are random acquaintances. I asked a couple of my friends and it's the same for them: Facebook for closer connections, LinkedIn for garbage. I don't need my LinkedIn connections knowing all the Airbnb places I've stayed at.<p>I've stayed at 10+ Airbnb places and have perfect reviews. I also willingly (a couple weeks ago) uploaded my driver's license.  Host now have a clear idea of me based on my license and past reviews. Do hosts really need to know my LinkedIn profile?  Honestly, to me, it seems like Airbnb wants to build out its graph and social connections. Maybe not spam you, but the social connections feature is pretty powerful so I can see why they'd want more social connections.<p>I have more to say but this is getting long.

This holds for any n, which means that, if you normalize by 1/sqrt(n) instead of 1/n, the ""randomness"" never vanishes even when n gets infinitely large.  If you normalize by something bigger than 1/sqrt(n) the variance blows up, and if you normalize by something less than 1/sqrt(n), the variance collapses to zero so you get something concentrated at a single point.<p>The CLT tells us more than that, it actually tells us how the randomness is distributed when n gets very large, which is pretty remarkable when you think about it.

Bash echos most characters, but it needs to treat a handful, like tab, up, and down, specially so it (or readline probably) puts the terminal in non-buffered mode and ends up echoing the normal characters. I read the GP as suggesting that there should be a way for bash to indicate which characters were ""normal"" and should be buffered and echoed and which it wants to see immediately.

5796491,comment,5787498,5795573,0,0,tptacek,,,"If it helps you understand the objection I have to this whole exercise: I think the whole contest was weaselly. You designed a challenge that stipulated away the simplest and most reasonable attacks on the system, and created an objective for the contest that would have been equally annoying to achieve had you used repeated-key XOR as your cipher instead of AES, and suggested in your promotion for the contest that its intent was to demonstrate something about cryptography. I think the commenter who parodied the exercise with a contest about a post-it on his computer hit the nail on the head.<p>But, since I didn't take the contest seriously, I didn't take the time to verify that you'd actually set up your server properly. Moxie, on the other hand, did. If I put $1000 on the line, I might have taken the time to ensure that the SSL connectivity I had set up for my server actually worked. You didn't; you left a vulnerability on your server that any security audit of any SSL-only service would have flagged as ""MUST FIX"". Moxie not only flagged the vulnerability but explained it to you and provided exact steps to reproduce it for you.<p>Here is is worth noting that $1000 probably does not buy enough of Moxie Marlinspike's time to compose the emails he seems to have sent you.<p>Instead of conceding the point --- that, in setting up a contest that obviously depended on your SSL/TLS connectivity actually working, you had made a material error that made the contest easy to win --- you raised an arbitrary objection: the judge of the contest was permitted to take arbitrary steps to verify in exacting detail which SSL certificate was presented, at least on the first connection if not on subsequent connections (as you note, Moxie didn't get that far with you). The same objection would have worked if you'd used a self-signed certificate; Moxie would have said, ""any MITM could interpose a new certificate"" and you'd have said ""oh, but I would check the fingerprint of the certificate against the certificate pinning list I maintain in my head"". Here, for obvious reasons, Moxie gave up.<p>Nobody cares about your money. The problem is that in ""staking"" $1000 on this contest, you've created a perception, exclusively among people who don't know much about cryptography, I'd add, that SJCL stapled to a web form is a viable mechanism for building a secure system (or at least, something more secure than just HTTPS). This perception is wrong, and it's aggravating that the $1000 gimmick reinforces it among precisely the people who most need to be made aware of how wrong it is.<p>I don't think you're a dishonest person, in the sense of, ""I would avoid doing business with you"". I don't know you at all, and certainly not well enough to judge your character. I do think you've fallen victim to message- board- lawyering, something (uh) many of us have problems with, and are reluctant to concede any point that harms your argument.

My initial post yesterday simply highlighted one method of indexing and out of that came many of the questions in here. In general Postgres is pretty flexible with what you can index with not many limitations, its impact on the rest of the schema aren't always so simple so would love to hear what you have in mind as impact.

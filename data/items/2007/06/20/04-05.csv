We did this and it really helped my wife get on board.<p>Also, don't let the startup take over. Maybe if you're single you can work 14 hour days ... but I've got a family, and it comes before startup (mostly :-). I'd rather be happy than rich.",1182314264

I think this was partly what got her enthused about microPledge. (Some of the chapters were too techie and not readable-out-loud, like ""A Plan for Spam"". We skipped those.)",1182313948

Very few markets actually behave like this: instead, you're likely to get 5-10 years of excellent performance, followed by 3-5 years of incredibly depressing performance.  The numbers become harder to figure with this, but qualitatively, the conclusion remains the same.<p>In practice, hedge funds often do well while whatever they invest in is rising, and then ""blow up"" entirely when they start to underperform and investors run for the exits.  Think LTCM or Amaranth, and it happens regularly on a smaller scale.  The managers make hefty fees in the good times, and the investors are left holding the bag when the fund blows up.",1182313449

29419,comment,29301,29381,0,0,Xixi,,,"I have to disagree: Hedge Funds usually take 20% of the profit above the High Water Mark, and above it only. Disclaimer: I'm working in a Hedge Fund with a 2/20 compensation structure, and I am leaving this very well paid job to start my own company, very far from finance, the Street, NYC, and actually very far from the United States...<p>Here is a little explanation (ignoring the 2% management fees, irrelevant for this discussion):<p>The fund starts at let say $100 per share. It makes 25% (before fees) the first year, so a share is worth $125. The manager takes 20% of incentive fees ($5/share) so each share is actually worth $120. Hence: the net performance for the first year is %20, and the new High Water Mark is $120 per share.<p>The second year the fund loses 16.6%, so now a share is worth $100. No incentive fees are taken. The high water mark remains at $120/share.<p>The third year the fund does 25% again (before fees). So now a share is worth $125. The fund charges 20% of incentive fees on $125-$120 = 5$, that is to .say $1. Hence the fund is now worth $124/share and that's the new high water mark, and the net performance for this year is 24%.<p>Conclusion:\nYear, Net Performance, Hedge Fund Fees.<p>1, +20%, $5/share.<p>2, -16.7%, $0.<p>3, +24%, $1/share.<p>I think that should be enough as an explanation to understand that the incentive is definitely towards higher performances.<p>Now in the real world, since investors get in and get out (and are trying to time this), it can be good to lose a bit to get some new investors on board... but that's psychology, not finance.",1182312575

29417,comment,29335,29413,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Good post. The only other Socratic book I own is ""What is Calculus about"" by W.W. Sawyer. It's more loosely Socratic though. There are paragraphs of text interspersed with questions that either ask you to look for a pattern, or else follow a statement to its logical conclusion.<p>Not as good as The Little Schemer, but it's still cool that you can learn traditional (non-lambda) calc knowing only addition and subtraction.

In fact, what would a life look like if one stopped creating and pursuing dreams?<p>I'm married, I still have dreams and still work to achieve them. Ideally, your marriage would incorporate the pursuit of both partners' dreams - a balanced approach.<p>Convincing your wife should be simple: tell her why you must pursue your dream. Ask her what her fears are and then explain your perception of each of those fears and how you plan to address them. It pretty much comes down to dispelling any fears she has. <p>",1182312025

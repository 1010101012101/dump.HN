So let's assume any order you have on the book stays there until the next tick's auction. In that case the HFTers are going to give a much higher spread, because if new information comes in at 3.2s and the stock is suddenly worth more than it was at 3s, but they can't withdraw their sell order until 4s, then obviously they lose money. So occasionally you'd get a better price on the discrete exchange (when the market moves further than the spread in the space of one tick) - but the HFTers would be terrified of this situation, and make their spreads wide enough that they think it's impossible.

I find Rachel's continued use of exploiting the victim role as a means of publicity to be somewhat deplorable. She did feed the troll on her kickstarter, it is their service to ban her from for TOS violations. Seeking sympathy as a means of promotion feels almost as underhanded and sleazy as ""stalking"" someone. Can the term stalker aptly be applied or is this just a case of on-line harassment? The use of the word may give incorrect context to what is occurring here. Is there such a thing as ""cyber-stalking"" - if so, we should differentiate between the two in cases like these.

I do not fail to sympathize with you and others who undergo any harassment, David.

This trivializes the issue at hand.<p>I'm sorry if you take offense at my wanting more specific labeling of the issue as well. Words have pre-fixed connotations and I do tend to think of things which take place on-line and in the real world as two very different levels of seriousness.

""Your sort of ""real world"" consequence indicate a lack of division between your life and digital presence then sir.""<p>I see. So, when this person emails about 900 people associated with the employment of a member of my family in a clear attempt to interfere with that employment, in spite of her actually having no involvement with whatever he imagines his gripe with me to be, and when he further threatens to use Photoshop to put her face onto a pornographic photo and email it to the same 900 people, that indicates a ""lack of division"" between my life and my ""digital presence"".<p>Have I got that correctly, sir? (And please enlighten me about the other ""side"" you see to that ""coin"", sir.)

You put your real name up on socnets and trolls leak over into your real world affairs - yes, that indicates a lack of division between your real world and on-line presence. I'm done here, man. I've had my say already from the get go, you are baiting, seeking engagement and perhaps engaging some of the very behaviors you of harassment you are discouraging here by so readily discounting alternatives to your own convictions. It's cool though man, I don't think poorly of you for this sort of hypocrisy, I'm just not gonna feed the trolls here myself. So best of luck with this crusade/tragedy-turned-promotional-tool for an egotist here. I'll not fan it's silly flames anymore. I should have known it was too sensitive of an issue and would need to be defended with the same careless zeal harassment is carried out with.

Commercial travel suddenly makes is possible for anybody who can buy a ticket (and can sign the waiver forms) to go somewhere in space.<p>More importantly, the kinds of jobs that we've been putting our astronauts to work on seem mostly like their terrestrial equivalents of ""truck driver"", ""construction worker"", ""janitor"" and now with asteroid mining ""miner"".

I wrote for example this: <a href=""https://github.com/drostie/ducky/blob/master/promises.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/drostie/ducky/blob/master/promises.js</a><p>I've abandoned it at this point for a very particular reason: operators don't work well in this phrasing. That is, the example case given in the above discussion:<p><pre><code>    function makeView(templateURI, dataURI) {
        var template = readURI(templateURI),
            data = readURI(dataURI);
        return Mustache.render(template, data);
    }
</code></pre>
...while it's not bad, also doesn't actually try to ""write logic"", in a post that's about ""write logic, not mechanics.""<p>What you really want to do is much more complicated because the example code starts to look ugly:<p><pre><code>    var userPromise = db.getUser(data.session);
    return userPromise.attr(""role"").equals(""admin"").then(
        render(open(""yay.xml""), db.send(data.request)),
        render(open(""no_permissions.xml""), {})
    );
</code></pre>
Don't get me wrong, I still like the idea and think that there might be a very promising way to do this sort of work in Node. Certainly I prefer those five lines to always writing:<p><pre><code>    db.getUser(data.session, function (err, user) {
        if (err) return callback(err);
        if (user.role === ""admin"") {
            db.send(data.request, function (err, reply) {
                if (err) return callback(err);
                render_file(""yay.xml"", reply, callback);
            });
        } else {
            render_file(""no_permissions.xml"", {}, callback);
        }
    });
</code></pre>
But as much as I <i>really</i> don't like that lame error stuff which breaks in a stiff wind, I also <i>really</i> want to be cautious about the exchange of these two lines:<p><pre><code>    if (user.role === ""admin"") {
    
    userPromise.attr(""role"").equals(""admin"").then(
</code></pre>
What we really want, I guess, is some sort of mesoscopic system -- we still want operators and familiar control structures from our ""micro"" world, but we also want lazy evaluations and so on from our ""macro"" framework. This is not impossible but it is hard to get right. If my ""ducky"" project moves forward it will probably look something like this:<p><pre><code>    return db.getUser(data.session)(function (user) {
        return (user.role === admin) ? 
             render(open(""yay.xml""), db.send(data.request)) :
             render(open(""no_permissions.xml""), {})
    });
</code></pre>
You bubble up the lazy constructs with returns, the error handling gets internalized within the lazy constructs, and the ""control-method"" invocation allows you to build an arbitrary control structure with whatever object you have right now.",1334840502

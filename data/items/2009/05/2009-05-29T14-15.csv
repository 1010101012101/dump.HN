Is your effort going to have those problems?<p>WRT Flash 10, it's tied to Adobe servers, at least for now.  On the other hand, it's likely to be installed on a large fraction of the web.<p>I'm somewhat surprised that Silverlight doesn't (yet?) have P2P support that is server agnostic.  (This would give developers/sites a reason to use silverlight instead of flash.)<p>I keep expecting a ""not-IE"" browser to include a P2P javascript extension.<p>If either happens, I expect that the other will happen in short order.",1243609173

632140,comment,631927,632047,0,0,Retric,,,"IMO, the only reasoanble way to deal with the carbon issue is a small ""sin"" tax at the point where fuel is mined / imported.  There are still a few corner cases, but they represent such a minute fraction of output that they are ignorable.  The advantage is automacticaly account for output on everyproduct and stage of production without atempting to calculate what it's carbon history is.  [You mined/imported 10 million tuns of carbon x, which you can collect from the person you sold it to and on down the chain.  They can ignore the tax as it's just an increase in fuel costs to be passed to the customer.]<p>I also suspect the impact would on coal would be much larger than that on gas. Which is a great thing because coal is far more replaceable than gas at this point in time.  You can then subsidize non carbon energy production / carbon storage equaly and let the market deside what's most effecent.  You can also ignore hybrids as the government focusing on a specific solution is less effecent over time.",1243608047

It meant that pages just plain worked first try on Opera no matter which browser you targeted initially.  That definitely wins me over.<p>That being said, Opera is the only modern web browser that we no-longer test for on Twiddla.  For a while we were putting in little Opera-specific hacks to work around its painfully slow rendering engine (which ironically is the reason it's such a pleasant browser to develop against), but eventually it became too much effort to be worth it considering the 1.35% of our traffic that it comprises.<p>So yeah, I'm with you in hoping it doesn't go away.

I also lack the perspective of viewing Wolfram's works from a couple of hundred years out.<p>Given all of that, why would I want to hold Wolfram in any more disdain than the guy at the local softball game who thinks he was the best baseball player since Hank Aaron? If anything, such people are fun to be around -- at least until you've heard all of their stories. They certainly don't deserve mockery. If you've got a problem with how somebody treats you because they are arrogant, that's one thing. But if you're just out there tearing somebody else down because they're an easy target -- they're clumsily arrogant -- get a grip and start treating total strangers better.<p>I thought about mentioning Jobs.

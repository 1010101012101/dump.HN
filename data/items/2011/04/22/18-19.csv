What Apple does is on a totally different level - mouse is not a scroll wheel is not a multi-touch sensor. They are all fundamentally different ways of interaction that change the things you _can_ and _cannot_ do with the device - you can't have the precision of the mouse on the iPhone but you can't do the iPhone's multi-touch gestures with the mouse. The design fashion companies do, doesn't have the same impact. Totally on-board with you on the rest of your thoughts.<p>As an aside, for people who are interested, at MacWorld 2007, Steve summed up the whole thing in just 1 slide... <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/gMIjp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/gMIjp.jpg</a><p>To a lot of people 'design' means white/gray rounded rectangles, but that's really not why Apple is where they are today.

2475004,comment,2474573,2474782,1,0,hagy,,,"While I wouldnt say I agree with it, Ive heard the argument that high specialization strongly selects for a students technical proficiency.  As a PhD student myself, Ive seen examples of this phenomena with highly intelligent individuals leaving our program as they couldnt foster the drive to learn the requisite highly specialized technical skills. In contrast, Ive also met individuals who developed their technical skills with rabid obsession, but who had trouble grasping the general significance of major publications in their field when the paper didnt fall exactly within their own line of research. The second type of individual makes for a wonderful post doc or research scientist, but only until the techniques theyve master are automated or funding for their specific lines of work goes dry.<p>Still, Id say the best researchers/professors that Ive met combined a deep understanding of the techniques in their own line of research with a broad understanding of their field and adjacent fields.  Personally, Id fear that removing technical proficiency as a requirement for a PhD would eliminate an essential bullshit detector that filters out certain people; people who do a great job speaking in broad generality but are incapable of formulating a path to accomplish these grand aims.<p>(As a quick anecdote, I once saw a research presentation from a grad student who made broad claims about his projects direct role in curing many forms of cancer. As he progressed, we learned he was only exploring strategies to synthesize a potential ligand that some other researchers would consider using in imaging a specific cancer within rat models. To this end he showed very little progress, but continued to speak at great lengths about the imminent eradication of cancer as he concluded his talked.)",1303498133

In a perfect world, a Master's should suffice if it gave you any lab experience at all (at least in science).</i><p>For a research position in industry, your job is to create new knowledge, and that's really hard to do. It's partly a matter of knowing what's already known, partly a matter of understanding how to do research, and partly a natural skill of just being ""a good scientist"" -- i.e. someone who can pick the right hypotheses, make the right approximations, and turn experiments into understanding. These are all hard skills, and I wouldn't be especially confident in someone having developed 'em in only a Master's.<p><i>The incentives are in all the wrong places. Schools want funding. They get funding by writing grants, which requires research. They want to do the research as cheaply as possible so as to maximize how far each dollar goes. So, they have a very strong incentive to keep grad students in limbo as long as possible, delaying graduation.</i><p>This much is true, especially in the US. In Australia, where I did my PhD, the funding agencies solved this problem by declaring that all PhD students should finish within four years, and that every semester after that results in certain funding penalties for the hosting university and department. (In case you think that this provides an incentive to grant undeserved PhDs don't worry, theses are marked by three examiners of whom only one can be at the student's university, and one of whom has to be in a different country).<p>Some parts of Europe are even stricter -- finish your PhD in three years or you're out the door.

It seems that any govt agency that exists, from the town up past the USG to the UN, wants to stick a finger in my business and stir it or take something out.<p>As an example, I run a small high tech design and manufacturing shop (mostly carbon fiber and similar tech).  This is THE MAJOR obstacle that has prevented us from hiring people for more than a few incidental projects.  Simply too much paperwork, regulations, and requirements to be managed before I get the first employee in the door.  Seriously, you need to hire an attorney, insurance and tax consultants, and accountants just to sort it out properly.  Worse yet, even if I do this, I still cannot be sure that I'm fully compliant with all requirements, and some govt agent isn't going to knock on my door next month to tell me I need to meet another requirement.<p>If the POTUS could make a program to streamline and organize ALL the governmental aspects of a startup or small biz, it would be enormously helpful.  If I could just go to one place (website, office, point of contact, whatever) and get fully setup, many more people would be hired.<p>This would also dovetail nicely with the recently announced program to reduce redundant oversight agencies, where multiple agencies regulate the same activity.<p>Oh yes, and simplifying the tax code would help too.  when I say simplify, I mean take the <i></i>tens of thousands<i></i> of pages of tax law and regs, burn them to a fine dust, and replace them with something that can be written on three standard pages.  I love that I'll be getting a nice tax credit this year for being a manufacturer, but I'd rather pay exactly the same as EVERYONE else (e.g., including GE), and not have to invest so much absolutely unproductive resources into complying with the so-called tax code.",1303497039

2474944,comment,2474573,2474573,9,0,jzila,,,"The system is so broken that I don't even know how to begin thinking about fixing it.<p>1) A PhD prepares you for academia. However, due to the market being flooded with PhD's, industry won't accept you for a research position without one, even if you don't need it. In a perfect world, a Master's should suffice if it gave you any lab experience at all (at least in science). If industry <i>does</i> accept you despite not having a PhD, your salary will be lower, your career will be capped, and you won't move as quickly through the ranks.<p>2) The incentives are in all the wrong places. Schools want funding. They get funding by writing grants, which requires research. They want to do the research as cheaply as possible so as to maximize how far each dollar goes. So, they have a very strong incentive to keep grad students in limbo as long as possible, delaying graduation. Since grad students often have major loans left over from undergrad, and the additional degree keeps them from having to make payments, they'd rather be stuck in grad limbo for years than be stuck without a job. This is especially true since student loans (both public and private) in the U.S. are inescapable (you cannot bankrupt your way out of a student loan).<p>3) Even afterwards, really badly paid postdoc positions keep you in academia for 3-4 more years before you can do anything with your education. It's almost indentured servitude with the ""promise"" of a better future (by the time you're 35). Unlike MD's who actually have a good salary in sight after they graduate, PhD's (after several postdocs) can only hope to make up to $120-130k after all is said and done (unless they climb corporate ranks in industry).<p>4) Research is fraught with politics. Instead of trying to actually contribute to the human knowledge pool, you compete with other labs for funding, for research (to be the first one that discovers something), and for spots in the best journals. When you discover a neat paper, it's a game of ""what can I do bouncing off of this research that will get me published in an awesome journal"" instead of ""let's collaborate with this lab, leveraging our strengths to contribute to human progress"". Quite often, several labs are running the same experiments just because they want to be the first to make a critical breakthrough. Competition can be great, but it can also result in wasted effort and bitterness at life.",1303496963

Firstly, the fonts are the same size, so they are competing for who gets viewed first. Second, the orange on ""What"" is a warm color so it will stand our more, hence overpowering the header.  So, I shrunk the ""What"" and increase ""Less Boilerplate.""<p>2. Too control the eyeflow from top to bottom, I increase the size of the navigation bar.<p>3. I increased repetition by changing the color of the header to white,the text to white and the separator in the navigation bar to white.<p>4.To highlight the ""What"" more I indent the text under it. And also set the text under it to be the same font size.  There is no conflict here, since the header ""What"" is already highlighted alot.<p>5.

Gerstner.<p>Like Jobs, he saved his company. Unlike Jobs, he was very much an outsider, but this apparently was what IBM needed to push change, given their hidebound culture.<p>From: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_V._Gerstner,_Jr.#IBM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_V._Gerstner,_Jr.#IBM</a><p>""Gerstner is credited with saving IBM from going out of business in the early 1990s. In his memoir, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?, he describes his arrival at the company in April 1993, when an active plan was in place to disaggregate the company. The prevailing wisdom of the time held that IBM's core mainframe business was headed for obsolescence. The company's own management was in the process of allowing its various divisions to rebrand and manage themselves  the so-called ""Baby Blues.""<p>Gerstner reversed this plan, realizing from his previous experiences at RJR and American Express that there remained a vital need for a broad-based information technology integrator. His decision to keep the company together was the defining decision of his tenure. The subsequent refocusing on the IT services business (which grew to nearly 50% of the IBM's revenues), the embrace of the Internet as a business phenomenon, and a broad effort to revive the company's culture are widely seen as having resulted in one of the most remarkable turnarounds in business history.""",1303495780

As pointed out very correctly in a comment above: ""I believe the problem lies in funding. Currently, we base funding largely off of publication success.""<p>However, all is not lost. I have made a conscious effort in my PhD to not end up super specializing. I have tried to take up a problem that requires me to learn about multiple different computer science areas (compilers, architecture, machine learning and graphics currently). This has made my PhD a lot harder as I have to spend considerable amounts of time reading while others are publishing papers and getting better scholarships, I do think this is better for me in the long term.<p>Overall, while I no longer recommend anyone else to do a PhD, on the flip side if you work hard enough you might still gain value out of a PhD. Whether that value is enough is debatable, and requires considerable effort, but it is also possible to not super-specialize by picking your research topic wisely.<p>I do agree with the article in general and do think that more cross disciplinary stuff needs to happen. The academic system is currently largely unsympathetic towards trying to cover multiple sub-areas even within computer science with people in other sub-areas often being unwelcoming. Funding agencies are also unhappy with the much larger ""startup time"" spent in cross-disciplinary projects during which you spend time reading and not publishing.",1303495665

The actual ideas stand out clearly, and there's just so much less code to read. In most cases, I'd happily sacrifice the performance.",1303495402

2474849,comment,2474573,2474827,5,0,gammarator,,,"I'd rephrase those as follows:<p>1) The system only trains PhDs for academic research.<p>2) A PhD does not guarantee an academic job.<p>PhD skills, particularly in technical fields, can be quite valuable in non-academic careers.  To make that transition, though, students need to do the legwork themselves to gain relevant experience and contacts.  (e.g., want to move into a programming gig?  Do some open-source work and put it on github to build credibility.)  Peter Fiske's ""Put Your Science to Work"" book is a good resource for navigating the culture shift.",1303495267

2474847,comment,2473553,2474748,3,0,SwellJoe,,,"I assume they wanted to beat the suit to discourage patent trolls from going after Linux and Android in the future. That plan backfired. I'm guessing it backfired due to the jurisdiction...Google's team may have underestimated the ignorance of the court and overestimated their ability to educate.<p>This particular suit is a tiny chink in a big dam. But, enough of these little patent trolls, as well as a few heavy hitters like Oracle, going after Google could cause them (and other Linux distributors, as well) significant pain. Fighting every patent claim is the only sensible choice. If patent trolls know Google never rolls over, and they're going to have to litigate every single time (and lose a lot of the time), they may be more hesitant to go after Google, and may instead choose more compliant targets.<p>If I were in Google's shoes, I'd do the same thing.<p>It may be that acquisition would now be a reasonable response, though the price of the company just went way up because of this win...unfortunately, now their patent troll business model has been validated.",1303495258
2474846,comment,2474573,2474793,1,0,markkat,,,">How does that make sense? If the supply is decreasing and competition for it simultaneously increasing, how does that make it less valuable (even in the cynical view of the PhD as a commodity)?<p>A degree is a commodity. The education behind it might be less so. I don't see it as cynical. The funding system requires a PhD, which confers a type of value on the degree. As you describe, yes, funding is currently very valuable, the degree has become less so.<p>>As I mentioned in my earlier comment, unless the PhD in question scammed the system (it happens), it at least proves that they have the focus to go deep. It's not a double implication though, which is what people seem to forget and then go on hyperbolic rants.<p>It doesn't necessarily require a scam. For example, sometimes the candidate of an advisor that is not very involved, but brings a lot of money and/or reputation, can slip through without proper scrutiny. Sometimes the committee is dysfunctional. There are many reasons why it happens.",1303495252

It's not that hackers don't want to see idea people succeed, it's that we don't have much respect for people who are on the sidelines and all talk with no action. I'm a developer, but first and foremost I'm an entrepreneur. If a person is willing to put their neck on the line while facing risk and uncertainty, they have my respect.

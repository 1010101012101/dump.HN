25599,comment,25226,25522,0,0,ced,,,"Yes, but the article is specifically about what one could do with all that money. And his answer is, more or less: buy a Mercedes.<p>I'm not even arguing <i>against</i> that. I mean, most companies make money by providing a useful service to people, so more power to him if he is successful with that. And if the dream of owning a big car keeps him going, great. I just find, personally, that aiming to spend ""only"" a million per year is not at all the kind of target that I want to set in front of me. <p>I wanted to know if I'm not alone in that frame of mind. I said it awkwardly. Sorry.",1180594374

25593,comment,25503,25503,0,0,kingnothing,,,"I followed through with a couple of online tutorials, then tried making my own app. I found it to be pretty difficult once I got past scaffolding and doing non-cookie-cutter things, seeing as how I didn't know much about the concept of MVC or where the line between Ruby ended and RoR began.<p>So, I picked up a copy of Agile Web Development with Rails and had at that for maybe a month, then I grabbed a copy of Programming Ruby (the pickaxe book). <p>I was also constantly asking questions and reading what was going on in IRC in the #rubyonrails room on freenode. Now I lurk around in there and answer the occasional question. Another great help was all of the RoR info being posted on reddit, but that site isn't even a shadow of its former glory now. <p>If you're more disciplined than I am, learn Ruby first, then learn RoR. Personally, I have a hard time doing that because my mind is always crawling with ideas, so I just dive right in to new things and figure out what I'm doing piece by piece. ",1180592890

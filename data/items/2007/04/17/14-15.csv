(I have to let the subconscious crunch on this one.)<p>""The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.""<p>I was just thinking yesterday that YC seemed almost like the Medici of Florence who were essential in appreciating and financing the Renaissance.  The money provided was helpful, but the environment of bringing all the great minds together from many fields created an unstoppable momentum of achievement.",1176821221
13643,comment,13484,13542,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Getting rejected by YC is not failure.  YC has specific things they're looking for, and only so many resources to go around; getting rejected means that (a) you didn't match what they were looking for or (b) you didn't seem as promising as some of the other people who applied.<p>A friend of mine is a marathon runner who usually comes in under 3 hours.  It turns out that there are enough people in that category that the Boston Marathon offers slots by lottery, and this year he wasn't one of them.  Not getting a slot in the Boston Marathon doesn't mean you can't finish the race; it just means you have to find a different place to run.",1176820986

It's only the people and the way they interact that separate it from Reddit, Digg, Fark, etc. So if you want to make a new ""text sharing website"" and have it be successful, you better have something better than the technology to differentiate yourself from your competition.\n",1176820893

There are different reasons people share photos, just as there are different reasons people share text.  That we even call such sites ""photo sharing"" shows how primitive our understanding is.  Imagine if we called news.yc ""just another text sharing site"".<p>""All the good tools are taken"" is the statement I disagree with most in this article.\n",1176819108

Goes back to a conversation we had before--be careful putting all your eggs in one basket.  If they were to stop these services or charge a lot more for them then there are a few of us who'd have issues.\n",1176818933

13634,comment,13608,13614,0,0,shiro,,,"There's a service in Japan where you can associate text to a point in a video.  You type text like chat while watching a video, and the text is recorded with the timestamp and played back along the video.  Association is bidirectional---you can jump to certain time point in the video from the text as well.    Currently most people just making fun, putting funny text on videos, but it would be quite useful to attach transcription by collaboration of audiences.<p>Unfortunately they only provide closed service for registered users: <a href=""http://www.nicovideo.jp/"">http://www.nicovideo.jp/</a>\n(Actually they originally used YouTube as a video source and had no access restriction.  But they got so much popular that YouTube had to shut down access from their site.)",1176818535

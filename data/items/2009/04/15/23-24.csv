564377,comment,564032,564032,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've never really questioned what was going to take the desktop's place.  3D UI's have been created and honed in the game and Visual Effects industry for several decades.  It's only a matter of time before OS's start to make use of some of the metaphors that are standard in game UI's.<p>I'd argue that the reason that they aren't popular now, is because we haven't had enough processing power on cheap, generic computers to make adding 3D elements to a UI worth while.  When we all have 16, 32 or 64 cores, sitting under out desks waiting around for something interesting to do, it is going to make a lot more sense to include more animations, videos, composites and 3D elements into our UI's.<p>3D and graphics heavy UI's also answer the question of, ""What can we possibly do with 64 cores on a CPU?""  This question was answered long ago:  render more video and more graphics.  Gamers haven't tired of having more parallel processing units on their GPU's over the past 20 years.  They get more processing power, they just crank up the triangle count in their models, turn particle rendering to ""high"" and set rail guns to ""awesome"".<p>I have no doubt we'll be doing the same with our OS eye candy soon.  I can't wait to use a CPU cycles for particle dynamics on my OS. :)<p>As far as loosing the desktop metaphor == backwards compatibility problems...  That's becoming a non-issue with virtualization.   With virtualization, you can have backwards and cross platform compatability with pretty much any OS out there except for Apple OS's.  <kvetch>Apple is the exception because they don't want you to play with their OS software unless you buy it with their hardware.</kvetch><p>It's good to thing about these things, though.

Right now, the hype is all about large follower accounts and how you get them by following followers of existing popular users.  However, a follower is not worth as much as a website visitor, because they are passive.  I know first hand that notification based content has very low response rates when compared to active content (search being the best example of active).<p>So... the power of a great domain name is that people who type it into the browser are active.  For example, if you have a good typo-squatted domain, you can get active visitors who, although mistyped the name of the desired website, are nonetheless interested in your content and are (relatively speaking of course) very likely to click on your ads.",1239839229

The events of your life and the memories in which they're recorded aren't parceled out into directories, or typed shoeboxes. An information beam incorporates documents of all types into one (focussable) beam. The question ""where did I put that piece of information?"" always has exactly one answer: it's in my beam.<p>Life isn't static. New information arrives constantly; time flows. So my beam has to flow. Or, in other words: the elements that make it up flow. They move at the rate of time. In this respect the structure is more of a ""stream"" than a ""beam.""<p>The stream has a past, present and future. The future flows into the present into the past. If I've posted an appointment or reminder in the ""future"" part of the stream, eventually it flows automatically into the present where I'll notice it and be reminded, and then into the past where it's part of the permanent, searchable, browsable archive.<p>When I acquire a new piece of ""real-life"" (versus electronic) information -- a new memory of (let's say) talking to Melissa on a sunny afternoon outside the Red Parrot -- I don't have to give this memory a name, or stuff it in a directory. I can use anything in the memory as a retrieval key. (I might recall this event when I think about Melissa, or sunny afternoons outside the Red Parrot.) I shouldn't have to name electronic documents either, or put them in directories. And I ought to be able to use anything in them as a retrieval key.<p>I can ""tune in"" my memories anywhere; I ought to be able to tune in my information beam anywhere too, using any net-connected computer or quasi-computer.<p>Those are the goals of our lifestream (or ""information beam"") project. In our view of the future, users will no longer care about operating systems or computers; they'll care about their own streams, and other people's. I can tune in my stream wherever I am. I can shuffle other streams into mine -- to the extent I have permission to use other people's streams. My own personal stream, my electronic life story, can have other streams shuffled into it -- streams belonging to groups or organizations I'm part of. And eventually I'll have, for example, newspaper and magazine streams shuffled into my stream also. I follow my own life, and the lives of the organizations I'm part of, and the news, etc., by watching the stream flow.""<p><a href=""http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/gelernter_qa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/g...</a>",1239838891

564351,comment,562236,563330,0,0,BerislavLopac,,,"The main problem with PG's article is that he is, as always, overly focused on startups. For something to be a revolution, it has to last for a while (otherwise it's just a rebellion, and a failed one on top of it), which is something directly opposite to the nature of startups.<p>By definition, startups don't last -- they either disappear (either by failing or M&A), or they stop being startups and turn into ""regular"" companies. But, that being said, I still think that Paul is on to something -- the future model of a succesful company is not a large multinational conglomerate like IBM, Microsoft or Shell, which is too large for its own good and where, like with dinosaurs, it takes ages for a signal to travel from limb to brain and back.<p>Instead, I believe that the future of companies lie in small, flexible and agile companies which have simple operations and global reach. This doesn't mean that a successful company should somehow prevent its own growth -- but it should grow in small units, sprouting new, smaller companies which operate on their own.<p>My favo(u)rite example, which proves that this model works, is the Virgin Group, which includes lots of small to medium sized companies which operate in a number of different industries. For a traditional, centralized company such diversity would be a suicide, but in this case the companies are connected by the common brand and its messages.",1239838447

It seems to mean chastising Amazon for taking too long to address the <i>serious</i> situation – which seems code for giving people too much time to make fools of themselves.<p>People need to slow down and think.",1239837330

(Technically, the flag for adult content was flipped from 'false' to 'true.')""</i><p>Oh yeah real technical.<p>The problem is, without more information, I do not believe a word of that. Filled in a form incorrectly? What form do they have that does that kind of thing? And how can an employee in <i>France</i> cause some kind of cascading re-categorisation of data in the USA?<p>That explanation sounds like total BS to me. For now, the trolling/CSRF explanation is more likely, IMO. The ""troll"" has given specific technical details, all of which at least pass the smell test. Amazon's explanation - a foreign employee filling in forms wrong - is just too cute.<p>Now if you'll excuse me I need to order more tinfoil hats on Amazon ....",1239836754

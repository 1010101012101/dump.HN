Virtual machines in some form or another were around for about 40 years before the gained the traction they did. MULTICS supported virtual memory for individual processes in the 60s, and it wasn't until the 80s until that became popular again.<p>Ditto for thin clients and programming languages. Good technology won't always catch on and if you really believe that something is superior you will have to spend a lot of time convincing people of that.",1212782221

And yet I am constantly making use of various ""YouTube clones"". Google Video. Vimeo. Fora.TV. Whatever TED is using. uStream. Omnisio. And that's just the ones I can remember from the last couple of weeks.<p>Of course, it's somewhat unfair to claim that all of these sites are ""YouTube clones"", because each one is different from YouTube in some subtle way (e.g. some of them emphasize livestreaming). Which is, of course, the point. No child is ever quite the same as the parent. That's how you can start out with jellyfish and end up with stockbrokers.<p>Are these sites ""getting anywhere""? Who knows? I'm guessing that many of them aren't profitable, but how profitable is YouTube itself? What really matters is whether your site is useful enough, and inexpensive enough, to stay open. Amoebas don't have to be as large as elephants, as smart as dolphins, or as sturdy as trees in order to coexist with them -- they just need water, food, and a modest amount of heat.",1212782015

Will absolutely light a fire under your ass.<p>Lots of lessons here, but to my mind the best is: your first version should suck. Not will, ""should"". On some measurable obvious axis, disruptive technologies are inferior to their predecessors, which is why the industry giants haven't done them already. Christianson's book is full of examples of things that looked crappy to the incumbents and their customers, but worked for some subset of the market, and then wound up eating the whole industry.",1212781796
211126,comment,208736,210867,0,0,william-newman,,,"Of course since I didn't take offense at being accused of making a ""major strawman"" argument, I won't mind being accused of another dishonest rhetorical tactic. At least it's not <i>major</i> ad hominem, yay.<p>When a discussion is devoted to trying to resolve a technical question, it is indeed bad to get distracted by personalities and sociology. But Crichton's article is not a technical article, it's an article on some meta-level like sociology. Not every thread has to resolve technical questions, and it is not a fallacy to talk about sociology in a thread started by a sociological analogy. There is a technical question underneath, certainly. But there are also entire websites (and professional journals, and other things) devoted to the underlying technical question. This thread doesn't need to be devoted to the underlying technical question too.<p>Imagine if the thread had started from an article analogizing Singularity attitudes today to Christian millenarian attitudes ca. 1000 AD. (Riffing on the ""rapture for nerds"" idea.) On such a thread, it would not be off topic to talk about personalities and behavior. Sociological discussion isn't necessarily trumped by the question of whether Singularity ideas are technically correct.<p>Of course, it would be bad if some reader got confused and thought that sociological considerations settle technical questions. If someone correctly perceived that was a major danger, it might even be OK to remind people: ""let's remember not to delude ourselves into thinking that talk of personalities and sociology trumps the underlying physical truth."" But it would be bad if a reader started firing off accusations of attempted rhetorical trickery at selected nontechnical/sociological remarks. Such a reader would himself be falling prey to the fallacy of being a major twit.<p>""What are you trying to say, Anti-GW people are nice people and GW-people are rude, therefore we should believe the Anti-GW? I highly doubt such a generalization, sorry."" You have willfully misunderstood my argument and then attacked the misstated version. Do you know any technical terms for that?<p>I stated explicitly some of the things I was trying to say. One thing I was trying to say is that martythemaniak's remark ""the horrible politicization by GW opponents is perhaps the second-best example of politicized science being overshadowed only by the disbelief in evolution by creationists"" looks like a repetition of a common ad hominem attack on AGW skeptics. I remain unconvinced by your analysis that it is merely an appropriate response given Crichton's provocation.<p>(""It's as if you say 'AGWs are like Creationists', then AGWs reply 'no we are not' and you claim victory by saying 'see, AGWs think their opponents are creationists'."" Indeed? It looks to me like someone wrote an article saying AGWs are like creationists, and the top-ranked response was ""the irony is overwhelming, because the truth is that AGWs are the modern eugenicists."" Though neither analogy is quite fair to martythemaniak, since both make it sound like he was merely posting an ad hominem attack. At least he had the good grace to back up his general rhetorical slam with a paragraph of actual technical information.)<p>Have a selectively outraged day.",1212781694

It&#x27;s a sexual choice.<p>What is wrong is that people can&#x27;t be open about that choice. People should be able to be open and honest about being polygamous or monogamous with their partner - yes, that might sometimes result in the relationship ending; but there&#x27;s a good chance where there is a disagreement it would have ended with heartbreak further down the line anyway. This should occur long before marriage is ever on the table, or even, before a relationship is on the table.<p>In Africa it&#x27;s important for people to know their AIDS status and be honest about it; I wish we could do the same thing with relationship preferences.<p>There is nothing wrong with wanting to have only one partner, there is also nothing wrong with wanting to have many partners. Both approaches to relationships have their pros and cons.<p>Either way, debate about polygamy vs. monogamy in this case-scenario is completely irrelevant. Someone was hacked, privacy was violated (it doesn&#x27;t matter <i>what</i> privacy) and that is the end of that. There&#x27;s no reason to attach another argument to the discussion because the hack was an outright violation in the first place.",1439970916

You get on the job, and it&#x27;s a whole lot more intense than expected. You can&#x27;t leave because you&#x27;ve just turned down a bunch of other offers and moved towns. You adjust to delivering maybe 25% more work hours than you thought. The company might do better hiring a colleague for you, but they don&#x27;t, so you lose out on free time while all the benefits of your increased production goes to shareholders.<p>There&#x27;s no recourse for this, and management knows it. They can hire people and make them work harder than they&#x27;ve been told, as long as it&#x27;s within the range where a sensible number of people won&#x27;t be looking for other jobs.

Then, by relativity of simultaneity for things which are separated by a spacelike spacetime interval, there is another frame of reference in which the point which is causally influenced by the other point occurs before the point which causally influences the other point.<p>That is, A influences B, and B is before A.<p>Which is retrocausality.<p>Therefore, because any two points in mostly flat spacetime (so like, no black holes or anything) which have spacelike separation can be taken to be before or after eachother, if one has a causal influence on the other, there is a frame of reference in which that would be retrocausality.<p>edit:<p>also, do you mean that I don&#x27;t intuitively understand relativity, or don&#x27;t intuitively understand light cones?<p>I don&#x27;t understand where you are getting the idea that &quot;warp and light cones clearly don&#x27;t work&quot;.

10084117,comment,10083395,10083395,0,0,monksy,,,"> One Netflix manager requested a PIP for a quality assurance engineer named Maria, who had been hired to help develop our streaming service. The technology was new, and it was evolving very quickly. Maria’s job was to find bugs. She was fast, intuitive, and hardworking. But in time we figured out how to automate the QA tests. Maria didn’t like automation and wasn’t particularly good at it. Her new boss (brought in to create a world-class automation tools team) told me he wanted to start a PIP with her.<p>Sounds like there is a problem with the manager. They haven&#x27;t trained Maria, nor did they motivate her enough to change. Did they even take the time to talk to the individual to sell them on the idea?<p>The only thing that I&#x27;m getting from this article is that only the most visible performing people should be considered to determine the outcome for everyone else.

Lithium is already the smallest non-gas atom, and we&#x27;re within an order of magnitude of its absolute limits. Even though it seems like batteries have improved a lot over the last two decades, the vast majority of that is due to electronics that consume less power, not increased battery capacity.<p>That said, cost can still be reduced and cycle life can still be improved.

When they give millions of dollars to someone studying the effects of underwater basket weaving on the English parliamentary system it is our money that is being well-allocated and utilized, not &quot;government money&quot;.<p>I feel the distinction is important because it connects the burden or benefit of the decisions government makes to those who work real jobs to pay for those programs, investments and financial bonfires.

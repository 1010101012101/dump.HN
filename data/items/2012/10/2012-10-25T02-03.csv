Specifying cert order wrong in the Intermediate Chain file will still break cert validation for some apps, because it's sent out exactly as the server admin configures (and this fact is often lost of folks who maybe touch their certs once a year when they expire).",1351133977

4696133,comment,4695395,4695535,8,0,tsotha,,,"I'm a programmer in my mid 40s, and sadly I can see that most 40+ programmers generally offer less value to their employers than they did a decade ago.  There are reasons for this:<p>1.  Health.  This is a big one.  By 50 sitting on your ass every work day for 30 years has caught up with you.  Hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes, back pain, etc.  You're going to take more sick days, take more time off to see the doctor, and you're going to come to work on drugs that make you tired or a little fuzzy, mentally.<p>2.  Lack of energy.  Even if you're healthy at 50 you don't have the same ability to roll with problems that you did when you were 32.  You can't put in extra time and maintain productivity.  When you get home you don't have the energy to tinker with technical stuff just for the fun of it.<p>3.  Cognitive decline.  Nobody likes to think about this, but the reality is for most people cognitive decline starts in your 30s.  By 50 it's affecting your productivity.  Things that you used to remember for as long as it mattered (like file, class, or machine names) you have to write down now.  It takes longer to pick up new technologies and you forget them faster.  This translates into lower productivity.  Maybe a little lower, maybe a lot.<p>So even though I'm getting to the age where it affects me, I don't blame companies and individuals for their reluctance to hire older guys.  It's based on real-world considerations.  If I get laid off will I be able to find another programming job?  Probably, but it's going to be a lot more difficult than it would have been 15 or 20 years ago.<p>I refuse to be bitter about it, though.  I had my chance to go into management and decided to keep writing code, even though I knew things would get dicey later.",1351133348

I sometimes participate in there out of pure boredom and to be honest I wouldn't buy my own logos. The problem with these sites is quality. The logo is the face of your business, you need a designer that's going to dedicate time and effort; a designer who cares about your business and understands branding concepts and design best practices, not just how to create a pretty logo. Logos don't have to be pretty, they have to be memorable and adaptable, that's the key.<p>You see, on speculative sites like that, where 99% of designers don't have a chance to win, people don't put any thought or effort into their work (including me) because for most of them it's not worth it. Most logos on 99designs are cliche, not print ready, and most of the time plain bad.<p>On these sites you have to think about players, not designers. Like Poker, the more players there are the less chances of winning you have, therefore you feel less confident, bet small and don't risk. Hardcore players will exploit all the known tricks and cliches to impress clients and win a contest. But what most clients don't understand, from my experience, is that a logo doesn't have to please them, it has to please their target audience.<p>If you want to build a successful image for your business, find a designer that you can trust and talk to. Go online, look for designer's portfolios, contact them to get a quote and go from there. Also understand that when hiring a freelance designer it's not ""work for hire"", it's a collaboration, and that's what those sites can't offer, and will never be able to.",1351132446

4696030,comment,4695791,4695791,22,0,jrockway,,,"I personally like the model ""try to do something illegal and then complain on the Internet"".  When people realize the laws are wrong, they'll change them. (Remember how epically SOPA failed?  Awareness is a key catalyst for change and many laws are for special interest groups rather than general interest.)<p>But even ignoring that, this article is crap.  It basically claims that taxi licensing exists for safety and that Uber is jepordizing the safety of the average man for the benefit of the out-of-touch Silicon Valley elitist.  Using facts to support this view, however, is difficult as there are none.  Uber uses licensed car services that are licensed to transport passengers but not to pick up people without a certain amount of notice.  The law that's being broken is saying ""I want a car now"" when the law says you have to say ""I want a car in one hour"" or otherwise hail a medallion vehicle.  Presumably the licensing process for drivers of cabs and car service cars is around the same (drivers must not rape their passenger, to use the example from the article).<p>The worst side effect of letting car services pick up passengers immediately is that the artificial value of taxi medallions will return to its true value of zero dollars, making a lot of people very poor very quickly.  There is an argument to limiting the number of cabs as a traffic-calming measure, but there is really no reason to discriminate based on vehicle type -- just implement a congestion charge and everything will work itself out.<p>Anyway, I like to see counterpoint articles on HN so I'm glad this was posted.   But writing a whiney blog post about how Uber is sticking it to the poor man is tiresome.",1351131058

He writes:<p>EventMachine is  A frankenstein guts the ruby internals  Not in active development  Makes non-blocking IO block  Requires special code from Ruby libraries  Hard to use in an OOP way  Is really difcult to work with  Poorly documented<p>I'm not sure I understand how EventMachine ""guts the Ruby internals"" (I didn't watch the talk). It's true that EventMachine's internals are C++, not Ruby; there was originally a reason (again, I think it had to do with green threads) that it was designed this way. I'm not sure I can think of the Ruby functionality that EventMachine changes, or the manner in which EventMachine mucks with the interpreter or its runtime. I'm obviously ready to be corrected, but I'm missing how this impacts me as a programmer. Maybe he's talking about exception handling?<p>I also wasn't aware EventMachine ""wasn't under active development"". Because it's just an IO loop. Is libevent in active development? Do I need to be aware of that to use it? The underlying OS capabilities EventMachine maps haven't changed in over a decade. I think I'm actually <i>happy</i> they aren't constantly changing it.<p>I also don't understand how EventMachine ""makes non-blocking block"". All EventMachine I/O is nonblocking; it's essentially a select loop.<p>I also don't understand what special code EventMachine demands from libraries. Maybe he means database libraries? That is, maybe he's referring to the fact that you can't use standard Ruby database libraries that rely on blocking I/O inside an EventMachine loop? I'm wondering, then, what he expected. We wrote a little library (a small part of it is on Github) to do evented Mysql, but we stopped doing that when we realized that Redis evented naturally, and we just hook Mysql up through Redis.<p>""Hard to use in OOP way"" just seems wrong, given that the ~30 evented programs I can find in my codebase directory all seem to be pretty object-oriented. So, that's not so much a question on my part.<p>Really difficult to work with? I've taught 7 different people EventMachine, in a few hours each. EventMachine is <i>easier</i> than Ruby's native sockets interface, in several specific ways.<p>I think maybe the issue here isn't so much EventMachine, but the idea of using EventMachine as a substrate for frameworks like Sinatra and Rails. <i>That</i> idea is whack, I agree. Trying to retrofit a full-featured web framework onto an event loop seems like an exercise in futility.<p>But on the other hand, I've been writing Golang code for the past 2 months, and Golang is <i>militantly</i> anti-event; it doesn't even offer a select primitive! Just alternating read/write on two different sockets seems to demand threads! And what I find is, my programs tend to decompose into handler functions naturally anyways. I try to force myself to write socket code like I did when I was 13, reading a line, parsing it, and writing its response, but that code is brittle and harder to follow than a sane set of handler functions.<p>So, long story short: I'm not arguing that evented code is the best answer to every problem, or that web frameworks should all be evented, or that actor frameworks aren't useful. It's probably true that a lot of people rushed to event frameworks who shouldn't have done that. But there are problems --- like, backend processing, or proxies, or routers and transformers, or feed processors --- where event loops are the most natural way to express a performant solution.",1351130405

8172024,comment,8169102,8171538,1,0,britman,,,"I think the point being made is that ship cycles are very different between B2C and B2B. I&#x27;ve experienced both (and to be clear I love the idea of frequent small releases) but in a B2B scenario multiple daily releases are simply not possible as you cannot use your customers as testers, I can assure you if you try contracts will be terminated. We ship every two weeks and that has taken a huge effort on our part to help our customers understand the value of a frequent ship cycle. On the flip side I think you can do this in a b2c environment (with appropriate quality controls of course) providing you understand the revenue risks if something is shipped poorly (as you mention with FB and Etsy), at that stage it&#x27;s pure business priority trade off.",1407920305

Your C++ code may be called by C code that knows nothing of exceptions.<p>2. Exceptions have big implications for API design. See for example GOTW #8 <a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/008.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/008.htm</a> , which acknowledges that &quot;some interfaces can&#x27;t be implemented in an exception-safe manner.&quot;<p>3. try/catch/throw have performance impact. Compilers optimize for the no-exceptions-thrown case, and the practical cost of throwing an exception can be prohibitively high. Google &quot;Zero-cost Exception&quot; for more.<p>The net result is that proper exception handling is difficult to incorporate gracefully, and &quot;exceptions are all fatal errors&quot; is a very reasonable position. Last I checked, Firefox is compiled with -fno-exceptions, and this is how Cocoa frameworks work as well.",1407916828

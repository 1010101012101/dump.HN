24293,comment,24271,24271,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"Depends on your definition of successful. If you want to build a website which accrues large amounts of advertising revenue - sure what marcus frind has done can be considered amazing. <p>Even making a 100th of what he does (maybe even a 1000th) would be enough for one person. Guess what - this happens everyday on the internet.<p>If you want to build a google, a microsoft, a paypal or something bigger its going to be hard for one person. From the investors perspective they want companies to generate a lasting difference to people's lives. Doing that as a one man band is hard. Generating monetary value for yourself is   the flipside to this. But then who needs investors.<p>Ivan i disagree with you. ",1180004222

24291,comment,24282,24283,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's entirely relevant, and not entirely untrue.  With the ""platform"" launching there will likely be dozens or hundreds of young companies building tools that work with Facebook.  If Facebook eats all profitable niches (as they seem more than willing to do, as shown by the low-hanging fruit of classifieds), even if ""partners"" are living in them, there will be no room left for those young companies.<p>I'd steer well clear of building anything that I expected to make money on for Facebook.",1180003501

24281,comment,24271,24274,0,0,boris,,,"""I think the statistics are pretty favorable to having a co-founder""<p>It's all in the details.  Let's say we have the same success rate for single founder and multiple founders ventures. There are many more multiple founders startups for at least two reasons: (1) it takes some guts to go alone and (2) VC/angels won't fund solo undertakings. Since the multiple founders pool is bigger, there are more successfull startups of this kind. Here you've got your misleading statistics.",1180001528

That's not something many startups can claim. Possibly Iqbal Quadir of Grameen Phone too.<p>Also some European startups such as skype, last.fm, moo etc",1180001168

""Founders at work"" is a great, great resource but it would have been even greater if it focused a little less on web stuff.<p>A very brilliant guy is Matt Dillon. Not the actor... well, he certainly is brilliant too ;) The software developer: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillon_(computer_scientist)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillon_(computer_scientist)</a><p>He started a few startups but he is mostly known as a BSD kernel developer wizard. He started the very innovative DragonflyBSD project (a fork of FreeBSD with impressive goals).<p>Chuck Moore (inventor of Forth and computer visionary) started/was part of a few startups, too. Lately, he has been with IntellaSys creating an impressive, radically-different microprocessor (""SEAforth"").<p>The story of Bill Joy (BSD, TCP/IP hacker and co-founder of Sun Microsystems) would be cool, too.<p>The Lisp Machine guys would be great as well (though there already is some info available of the net).<p>And why not founders in fields not related at all with computers? The founders of Bose, Hobie Cat, etc.<p>EDIT: yes, there is a lot of superlatives :)",1180000903

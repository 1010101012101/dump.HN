However, I&#x27;m unsure which one to choose. The language does not matter much to me, I&#x27;m fine with Perl and Python and Lisp and any other language as I can probably learn a lot by just using them. After digging through &quot;the list&quot; and playing with some of the most recommended generators (including Hugo), I narrowed it down to:<p>1. Pelican <i>(most widely known and supported and I already know some Python; has had some problems with setting up a custom theme when I tried it)</i><p>2. Coleslaw <i>(interesting language, I guess it&#x27;s fun to play with it; development seems to be quite slow though)</i><p>3. Statocles <i>(eye-hurting default theme, no other themes provided, but the developer&#x27;s future plans look bright)</i><p>4. Frog <i>(another interesting language, a quite responsive developer, Bootstrap support, but also a rather slow development)</i><p>5. Hakyll <i>(I couldn&#x27;t find out how to theme this one properly yet, also I don&#x27;t speak any Haskell)</i><p>I asked a decider web app, but of course it can&#x27;t know which one would fit my needs best.

Categories <i>and</i> tags support. (Or: A way to make tags/categories &quot;parents&quot; of other tags/categories.)<p>4. Sitemap generation support. In 2015 Google would like that.<p>5.

Secondly, to reduce the amount of people forced into unemployment by making more people <i>choose</i> to not work or work less, whether because they choose education or choose to stay home with their young children, or choose to retire earlier, or simply choose to make do with less.<p>Of course, the pre-requisite for that to be viable is that society can make do with 13% less work effort (or whatever it ends up being, whether more or less).",1446868099

And it seems to be getting worse year over year, especially in homes built after the Great Recession. The only exceptions seem to be the double-digit-million-dollar luxury homes.<p>As for the pros and cons of old construction...<p>Pros: generally more durable, more attention to detail, nicer materials used. Will suffer from age-related maintenance issues, but unlike modern construction, is unlikely to suffer from issues related to fundamental structural or design failure.<p>Cons: design and layout choices that no longer fit a contemporary lifestyle (small or no closets; tiny bathrooms and kitchens; closed floor plans; etc.). Generally poorer insulation. Depending on the age of the home, it may also have issues with old plumbing and, having not been designed for central heating or A/C, will sometimes be a bear to deal with in that department.<p>All things considered, having lived in a c. 1920s home and a series of c. 2000s and c. 2010s homes, I&#x27;d take the older house 9 times out of 10 and just gut/retrofit as necessary to remedy layout issues (not construction-quality issues).

When we repointed our building, we found an English stonemason with a background in historical buildings (it&#x27;s not cheap, architecture).

Did Steve even write a line of code. A startup this technical needs a super coder at the helm. In short, it should have been obvious to us outsiders that Famo.us was about nothing more than its unsuccessfully self-referential and self-serving name, &quot;Fame.&quot;<p>Like many, I bought into it though. I mean--minus the hype-style marketing that should have been a clear warning that this company is not to be trusted--they did clearly assert their vision: to kill the Native Problem for javascript developers.<p>The fact that Steve was more concerned about money and making one of those type of startups, rather than hunker down with a small team and get a focused job done like the Meteor team has, astounds me. It&#x27;s basically an outrage. How about hire a smaller team and not send them on wild goose hunts building stuff beyond the core vision. It&#x27;s typical startup nonsense where inexperienced non-technical founders want to build the world and don&#x27;t grasp the importance of focusing on a true MVP. I don&#x27;t care that he was--i think--the #3 guy at Powerset, or that he kinda can code. From the looks of how busy he was at all the Famo.us marketing side of things, there&#x27;s no way that guy was leading an engineering team--i.e. the only way this sort of grand vision could ever be accomplished.<p>The messed up part is that what they finally released at the end seemed to be on point with what we need. The interface is on point. It&#x27;s a great start at least. Had they been more focused they could have arrived their earlier. And then they could have stuck to their guns and stuck it out until their framework got an actual following. But they never got a following, and therefore (combined with his needs for Fame and Money) Steve felt the need to pivot. Had they had any semblance of a following/userbase, this wouldn&#x27;t have happened. Seen this happen so many times.

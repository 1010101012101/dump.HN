987560,comment,987497,987497,0,0,patio11,,,"I like analytics as a field but I rather doubt I'd like IBM's conception of analytics as a career.  They're looking to provide analytics of middling complexity -- one step above what any idiot can get out of the tool -- as an outsourced service for the cheapest they can possibly get it.  The cheapest they can possibly get it is <i>not</i> you.  Sure, if you're a Google Analytics or urchin jockey at the moment, you probably have a few years before India/China catch up to the high-demand-low-required-skill opportunity, but once they collectively do, you'll be in the bread line next to web designers who primarily slice PSD into HTML.<p>If you wanted to do it as a career, I'd think less chart-creating-monkey and more ""analytics architect"" or maybe ""marketing manager with deep skills in analytics to coax extra millions of performance out of our CPC/etc campaigns"".",1260435069

If so, its better to take this review with a grain of salt.<p>I don't own any e-reader or plan to buy one anytime soon, My mac book does a good job. Generally speaking ebook market has a lot of room for innovation, with the possibility of big players like apple entering the tablet market soon, it will drive innovations among competitors and consumers will benefit from superior products in a year or so.<p>Unlike computers, e-readers can tie you down with their proprietary book formats saved in your ""library collection"". So its a good idea to think long term when you invest on your book reader, not so much because of the cost of the book reader but the value of your book collection that you might not be able to transfer from one reader to another if you change your mind.",1260434883

Suffice it to say, I now refuse to subscribe to such arrogant notions about the poor. Perhaps you should do the same - spend Christmas with someone living in a bad neighbourhood, befriend some of them, treat them like nuanced human beings instead of caricatured archetypes.

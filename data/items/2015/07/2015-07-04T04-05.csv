I&#x27;m also going to piggyback a bit because another thought I had seems related.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue that among languages like Python, standard libraries (like multiprocessing[0]) make parallelizing code <i>trivial</i> (even with/despite the dreaded global interpreter lock). I rewrote some of the code the author uses and on a smaller number (6710886 instead of 67108864) I&#x27;m seeing ~1/3 the time to run compared to his baseline with 4 worker processes (27.469517s vs 1:25.373176). I haven&#x27;t looked into what might be keeping it from being a full 4x faster, but my hunch is that it&#x27;s a combination of other things going on in my laptop and the undeniable difference in execution speed in cPython (specifically, cPython3.4).<p>One might make the argument that this is a wildly unfair comparison, but my bigger-picture argument is that a language that abstracts things like parallelization to the point that one can invoke such features in a line or two of added & changed code is probably worth factoring into an analysis, if we&#x27;re even interested in analyzing languages in this way.<p>If we&#x27;re going to write C-like code and run it as Python, should we be surprised when it doesn&#x27;t live up to those expectations?<p>[0]: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html</a>",1435985675

  be conservative and only generate that subset. However, you should also
  be liberal and accept everything that the protocol permits, even if it

The police in the US have both a tendency to shoot too many people, and have a tendency to target too many black people, which both add up to shooting disproportionately many black people.<p>And yeah, the problem is more complex than simple racism by police. There are problems of too many criminals being armed in the US (both black and white), meaning that the police are more prone to shoot in supposed self defense. There are problems of class and poverty, that lead people into violence. There are a lot of complex, interrelated factors that lead to this.<p>But all of that said, it is undeniable that there are a disproportionate number of law abiding or peaceful, unarmed black men who are killed by police in this country.<p>> The real race problem is that when it comes to interracial violence, and black on white vs white on black, the facts are black on white racial violence is off the charts compared to white on black racial violence. It&#x27;s not even close.<p>Interracial violence is a pretty small fraction of all violence.<p>Most violence is intraracial.

If you&#x27;re white, I&#x27;d be a lot more worried about that 45% than the 8.8%.<p>You know what&#x27;s likely to be the most likely way to avoid getting killed or shot? Not having family members who have ready access to firearms. You are a lot more likely to be shot by a family member in anger than you are by a stranger of another race.",1435984727

For example, a few weeks ago I sat down and decided I wanted to write a web server in go (think nginx/apache). I knew going into the project I wanted a really nice and easy to use configuration file to define the settings. So, I did what most people do these days I and used json, but that didn’t really feel right to me. I then tried yaml, but yet again didn’t feel like what I wanted. I probably could have used ini format and made custom rules for the keys and values, but again, this is hacky. This spawned a new project in order to solve the problem I was having and ended up being forge, which is a hand coded configuration file syntax and parser for go which ended up being a neat mix between json and nginx configuration file syntax.</i><p>You make a persuasive argument for why someone should <i>not</i> write code every day, but instead step away from the keyboard occasionally and get a sense of perspective.<p>No, your mix between json and nginx configuration file syntax is not &quot;neat&quot;. It&#x27;s pointless, and doesn&#x27;t solve any real problem. In fact, if anyone ever uses your idea it will <i>cause</i> problems, by adding another random pointless format for the rest of us to have to support.<p>And did you miss the beginning of what you said? You set off to write a web server and instead you got bogged down in parsing the config files. Your efforts did not produce a web server. Writing code every day has apparently not taught you how to focus.<p>In short, quantity of code does not beget quality. Quality code isn&#x27;t just code that&#x27;s nicely formatted, clear, terse, etc., it&#x27;s also code that solves a real problem that you&#x27;ve set out to solve. And just writing more code isn&#x27;t going to help you learn what a real problem is, let alone how to solve it.",1435983506

At higher values of n, they have the same performance (as expected).  That discrepancy is easily explained by considering start-up time, which C++ could certainly suffer from.  Combine that with the consideration that the values for n where the two differ result in a computation time < ~10ms, which is about the range where startup time is going to significantly impact results.<p>This is also easy to see by looking at the second derivative of the graphs.  When n is large enough to outweigh startup time, the graph should be linear.  The areas where the second derivative is non-zero indicate that start-up time is affecting results.<p>You can see that all the languages have some kind of startup time impacting results.  Java in particular has the same performance as C/C++ under this test, but has a significantly larger startup time.<p>Really experiments like this should split the results to explicitly show these two aspects of performance.

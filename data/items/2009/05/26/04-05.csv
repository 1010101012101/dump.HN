626265,comment,626103,626103,0,0,ispivey,,,"The really shady thing is how Swoopo shows the same auctions to people bidding with different currencies.  Look at the front pages of these two sites:<p><a href=""http://www.swoopo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swoopo.com/</a>\nand\n<a href=""http://www.swoopo.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swoopo.co.uk/</a><p>You probably won't see the same items I do, but I'm sure you'll note two ridiculous (dishonest?) things:<p>1) You'll see the same item listed for the same number of US Dollars as Pounds Sterling (e.g. I see an iPhone for $86.50 and £86.50, with the same ""countdown"" running).  This is not outright deceptive for penny auctions because, after all, the current ""bid"" is just a score, not an actual value that anyone ever pays.<p>2) You'll see that people in the US and UK are bidding against each other on the same auction, but people in the US and UK <i>think they're bidding on different items</i>.  For example, I see on the US site a Sony VAIO VGN-AW220J/B 18.4-Inch Laptop for $10.27 with 2:45 remaining, and on the UK site a Acer Aspire 8930G 18.4"" Notebook for £10.27 with 2:45 remaining.  If you click through to both auctions, you'll see the same people and bids on both - they're clearly the same auction.  Presumably when someone finally bids, Swoopo buys whatever item they think they won and ships it to them.",1243312218

Yeah, its a loss, but they've been neglecting it for a while, so it is sad.",1296176354

2150339,comment,2149105,2150287,0,0,kmfrk,,,"I agree with your argument as far as ""fuck"" is concerned, but not ""rape""; ""shit"" is analogous to ""crap"" and ""excrement"", and yet it is deemed more offensive and strong, because, let's say, its ""power"". That doesn't mean it should be - in a decade or two, it will probably not raise many eyebrows, but by then, new terms will come up, because people want to express themselves in the way the people who initially started using the word shit did.<p>""Rape"" isn't irksome because of its power, but its meaning; if there were or are synonyms, they would be just as bad (assuming they weren't euphemistic to the point of complete obfuscation).<p>To see American news channels use terms like the ""F-word"", ""N-word"", ""C-word"", etc., when they are reporting on what someone said, it becomes farcical. It reminds me of the Fry and Laurie sketch in a courtroom where Hugh Laurie quotes a heated exchange, but has to replace all the profanities with words that aren't offensive to the court, which obviously distorts the picture and thereby completely destroys the purpose of it.<p>They already say ""rape"" outright when reporting on it - which they should - because that's more of a quantitative word. The word ""rape"" shouldn't be banned or anything like that, but people shouldn't become oblivious to the meaning and ramifications of the word.",1296176344

My overbearing passion is health - more specifically neuroscience so I thought I'd chime in.<p>I think, intuitively, we conclude that the ideal situation is to be a full time entrepreneur. However many people in the tech-field don't agree with that notion (DHH) and have been very successful in spite of adhering to it. Being strapped for time when working on my startup demands that I be efficient. I don't have the time to waste on superficial/cosmetic features. If I can't get to the meat of the matter quickly then I won't get anywhere. I have been able to use that pressure so I can speed through my school assignments and get to what I really love - which is working on my website.<p>It's not that I'm afraid to leave college and go full time into my startup but instead that it's my belief that doing so would be too easy. It would be too easy to quit school and spend all my time on my startup, I'd rather earn that right of going full-time when the time comes. Not to mention being faced with the alternative of spending the rest of my days in corporate America is a huge motivation for me to get out of there.<p>All I can say is my life is hectic as hell. Full time uni, 18/hrs a wk working, a startup, and maintaining a social life. I'll admit I don't have time to shoot the shit, I can't play video games, and the only reading I do is that which has a practical application to my business. But I can honestly say that not only is it possible but I think that I am slowly discovering that it is (counterintuitively) optimal.<p>Good luck,",1296175695

2150304,comment,2148742,2150194,0,0,Groxx,,,"><i>It sounds like your most of your complaints are with the .Net platform, library layout, and the compiler.</i><p>Only about half-so.  The first paragraph was all about VS exclusively, minus ""too many warnings"".  But due to the issues in .NET, you essentially <i>must</i> use Visual Studio, which makes it at least bearable due to intellisense.  But I crash VS fairly often, it eats up a half-gig or more of memory fairly often, it thrashes my hard drive to bits all the time so everything else crawls, and at one job the visual designer <i>started executing code</i>.  Those database-filled combo boxes started querying the database right in the designer.  This happened 3 or 4 times over a couple months, and could have been catastrophic if any of the times it happened occurred on deleting fields.  I will <i>never</i> hook a database directly up to VS, I'll guarantee you that; this was executing our bound events.  Imagine if we actually had direct connections to the DB.<p>So, one that's more specific to VS: the idiotic Web Site ""projects"" that have zero capabilities, and not even before / after build events to hot-wire your own in.  And I <i>dare</i> you to try compiling documentation on a Web Site project.  People have been asking for it and attempting to hot-wire their own for <i>years</i>, and they use <i>gigabytes</i> of memory to parse small projects and choke after an hour and give up without anything more helpful than ""MSBuild.exe encountered an unexpected error"".  I suspect very much that the slowness of the only decent help builders is due to the horrendous reflection side of .NET, but that's not VS's fault.  Except that VS wants VS-style documentation and won't accept anything else, but nobody can use it.<p>And, because it's <i>particularly</i> bad, I'll point to the JavaScript support again (2008.  I hear 2010 is a bit better).  It throws fits and doesn't always even index global functions you just declared (it's <i>entirely</i> broken on the site I'm working on, it simply refuses to parse anything not in assemblies), Intellisense tries to change ""$()"" to ""$addEventHandler()"" as you type, and it has the absolute worst indentation of <i>any</i> code editor in existence.  None would be better, but it occasionally decides you're not neat enough and imposes ""order"" on your nicely readable function.<p>edit: Ooh!  Another one!  It's <i>such</i> fun to use VS in a multiple-monitor setup.  Either you use the annoying ""Multiple Document"" layout (inner-windows that waste tons of space and fall behind things when the docked windows change), or you use tabs and can't spread to a second screen effectively.  Or you launch two versions, and have them throw fits when you build in one, and the other sees things changing.  And there is no higher joy than editing web.config while two instances of the same project are running, and watching the Visual Studio hit the fan.<p>--- </rant> I feel better.  Thanks :)<p>Nearly any other programming editor, really.  Notepad++ is a good example though, and doesn't require install, so I'd suggest experimenting with that.<p>In VS: hold alt and select a box of text.  Note that you can't select less than a single space wide.  You can copy, paste, and delete it.  Now try hitting space, or typing something: the whole set is erased, and you start entering text at the top-left corner of what you had selected.<p>In nearly any other editor: hold alt and select a box.  Note that you can select a column ""0"" wide. Copy, paste, and delete work as expected.  But start typing; the vast majority I've used will fill the entire column <i>as you type</i> with what you're typing.  Backspace removes line by line after the initial replacement.  You edit the column, and everything you do is duplicated to the other lines you had the selection in.<p>It'd be especially useful for .NET as damn near <i>every</i> useful method returns void: want to populate a list with a few items?  Select a few columns, type ""list.Add("" and you're most of the way there.  Plenty of times the refactoring tools (as good as they are in non-VB languages) don't work if you're not changing <i>everything</i>, and having a column editor would make things a lot faster.  Besides, they have <i>half</i> a solution working; why did they stop at the nearly-useless step?<p>Another handy thing many programming text editors will do, but VS does not: soft-tabs go away with a back-space to the next tab-stop (if you start at one).  In VS: keep hitting until you reach what might be another tab stop, there are no indicators for such things.  Happy counting!",1296175458

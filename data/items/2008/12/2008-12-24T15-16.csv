Any time you are in a position to perform a passive attack (snooping) you could also perform an active attack (MITM).  The only difference is which point-and-click attack tool you download.",1230133783

On one side there's change-the-world apps that dozens of developers labor over for years at a time, slowly building a customer base, nurturing an idea with great business execution into something that provides real, tangible value to folks.<p>And then there's i-Fart, which could've been made by some guy with a hangover during a weekend spent picking his nose and eating stale pizza while watching re-runs of Gilligan's Island.<p>This is a great time to be alive!",1230133698

Mod me down.  But it's moments of genuine connection with another person that make me most proud, thrilled to be a human.  I think we have to learn to empathize and to cooperate, if we are to survive as a species.  And it makes me proud when I find a speck of that ability, in myself.<p>When it's a stranger I'll never see again, I have some confirmation that I don't expect something in return, at least not in the immediate sense.<p>When someone does the same for me, I feel I've seen the other side of the equation.",1230133321

408839,comment,408786,408786,0,0,sabat,,,"He's right that we need to reboot -- but the irony is that it's his generation (and his mentality itself) that is forcing this. The I-got-mine, greed-is-always-good, me-first, I'm-entitled generation of baby boomers (circa 1940-1958) is directly responsible for this mess. And, as usual, it's up to us Xers to clean up.<p>Friedman is emblematic of his generation. He likes to make blanket statements like ""the world is flat!"", leaving out precious details (like the fact that cultural differences mean that a guy in Mumbai cannot so easily start the next Amazon), and expects parental-like approval from all of us. Look what I did! Look at me!<p>Same attitude -- self-satisfied under-achievement -- created this gigantic CF we're calling an economy. Reboot? Yes. That probably means forcing all these codgers into retirement homes where they can bitch and moan about how we Xers aren't doing well enough recovering from their disaster.",1230132652

It's essentially building the learning curve of the system into the functionality.

408831,comment,408784,408784,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Emacs already does something like this, albeit to a much lesser extent: Some useful commands, such as set-goal-column (C-x C-n) or narrow-to-region (C-x n n) are disabled by default and will ask if you actually intended to use them - otherwise, bumping C-x C-n would be really confusing, for example. (It makes the cursor jump to a specific column whenever you move up/down a line.)<p>Of course, its interface could be better structured for gradual learning - while the documentation is certainly there (info pages, C-h t), there's a lot to learn upfront. Advanced features for difficult stuff shouldn't get in the way of basic tasks.",1230132102

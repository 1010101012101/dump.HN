6245806,comment,6243081,6245328,3,0,smtddr,,," So, I understand where you&#x27;re coming from. At this point it feels like we should all just pick up our guns, go to the whitehouse and let them <i>really know</i> how we feel. 
 But, there&#x27;s still hope without that extreme. US History has shown other, more hopeless, situations eventually being fixed. In pretty much all the cases, it took awakening the masses for the change to come about.
 As powerful as the NSA & USgov seem to be, one thing can destroy it all - awakening the public. Also, the NSA/USgov is playing on our home-turf. Technology & internet is not something they hold an advantage above us on. One slip up on their part, or one good idea on an activist&#x27;s part, and the masses could wake up and the NSA would fall to pieces in the course of a month or 2. Don&#x27;t give up, just keep talking about it to anyone who will listen. Keep on increasing the probability of another Snowden. My family doesn&#x27;t really care or fallow this NSA-stuff, but they have heard of it and it decreased their trust in the government. That&#x27;s good enough. Just keep decreasing trust in USgov; increase probability of &quot;A wild Snowden suddenly appears!&quot;. Eventually, something dramatic will happen and this whole thing will reach a conclusion. I can&#x27;t say what that conclusion will be though... but it&#x27;ll happen, it&#x27;ll be spectacular... and then we&#x27;ll all know where we stand after the dust clears.",1377025072

6245803,comment,6243946,6244702,6,0,spc476,,,"Here&#x27;s a Lua-esque (since Lua supports coroutines) example.  I want to run a simple TCP echo server, so the main code that handles a connection ideally would look like this:<p><pre><code>    function echo(socket)
      local remote,data = socket:read()
      if remote == nil then -- no data
        socket:close()
        return 
      end
      socket:write(remote,data)
      return echo(socket) -- Tail call, this is a goto
    end
</code></pre>
Normally, such code would need to be run in a separate process or thread but that&#x27;s too much overhead.  You can use an event-based method (say, with poll() or epoll()) but then the code becomes inverted (or involves callbacks---which in this case isn&#x27;t too bad, but imagine trying to implement, say, SMTP).  With coroutines, we can still use an event-based mainloop, but still keep the imperative style of the original function above.  Our event loop would look something like:<p><pre><code>    function mainloop()
      local events = select:events()
      for i = 1 , #events do
        local err,keepgoing = coroutine.resume(events[i].code,events[i].socket,events[i].remote)
        if not keepgoing then
          select:remove(events[i].socket)
          events[i].socket:close()
        end
      end
      return mainloop()
    end
</code></pre>
and we would need to change our function just a bit:<p><pre><code>    function echo()
      local socket,remote = coroutine.yield(true)
      local data = socket:read()
      if data == nil then
        return false
      end
      socket:write(remote,data)
      return echo()
    end
</code></pre>
Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the coroutine to accept new connections:<p><pre><code>    function echoconnection()
      local socket = coroutine.yield(true)
      local connection,remote = socket:accept()
      select:insert(connection,{ read = true } ,{ code = echo,remote = remote })
      return echoconnection()
    end
</code></pre>
You can, of course, rewrite it such that socket:read() does the call to coroutine.yield(), but here I wanted to make it more explicit (as well as a shorter example) to fully hide the implementation (this is based on a working implementation I have in about 224 lines of Lua, which also handles signals and hides the coroutine calls from the main functions---the first example in this post would run as-is in the fully-blown implementation).",1377025043

6245796,comment,6244882,6245504,1,0,baddox,,,"There&#x27;s no point in arguing semantics without being clear on the definitions I&#x27;m using. I use &quot;politics&quot; to refer to the practice of participating in an organization that governs. By &quot;governs,&quot; I mean has the legal authority to exercise physical control over a region or group of people. In the context of modern Western nation-states, I use &quot;politics&quot; to refer only to participation which is <i>condoned</i> by the government. So I consider voting, running for office, helping with election campaigns, lobbying, etc. to be political acts. I don&#x27;t consider other attempts to influence governments to be inherently political acts, like civil disobedience, participating in black markets, and other forms of counter-economics.<p>Obviously, in the broadest sense, anarchism is relevant to political philosophy because it is the suggestion that governments and therefore politics shouldn&#x27;t exist. Analogously, atheism is relevant to religion because it is the suggestion that religion is incorrect. And yet, with the definitions I&#x27;m explicitly using, anarchism is not politics and atheism is not religion.<p>And to be clear, there are certainly anarchists (and, much more commonly, minarchists) who blatantly use political methods to achieve their desired results. A prominent example would be Ron Paul, who is arguably an anarchist, but seems to believe that using the condoned political methods to move the USA toward a smaller and more constitutional government is useful. I disagree with these people.",1377024960
6245795,comment,6244882,6244882,2,0,EGreg,,,"I think most of the outrage is about two things, which are missed by people who point out the problem is political and that snooping is technically &quot;legal&quot;:<p>1) The disconnect between policymakers / lawmakers and the general population, that built up over time. While in some areas people are content to look away, or don&#x27;t care that much about, in the area of civil rights and privacy apparently enough people care to keep raising a stink about this. It&#x27;s not that something is technically illegal. It&#x27;s a question of how did we get to the point where it&#x27;s not. Where you don&#x27;t need a warrant to read anyone&#x27;s email, or demand any US company hand over pretty much any info on anyone. Where are the 3-branch checks and balances for things like National Security Letters, for example?<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/GPyb5uC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/GPyb5uC.jpg</a><p>2) The natural people&#x27;s reaction to advancing technology. Since recording everything everywhere is now becoming possible, we should get used to it. We are unlikely to successfully outlaw this anymore than we can successfully police pirating of songs. If governments aren&#x27;t going to record you, corporations will. Facebook keeps a &quot;shadow profile&quot; on everyone including people who didn&#x27;t sign up. They use this data for various corporate purposes. All we can do is perhaps regulate what purposes they cannot use the data for, but it&#x27;s extremely hard to prevent them from collecting it. So organizations will collect data, because it&#x27;s in their interest -- stores, for example, will soon track your shopping habits as you move around the store, and optimize their sales for this. They might do facial recognition or some other biometric thing.<p>#2 is the more interesting issue and I think it falls into the bigger issue of people coping with advances in technology. Google glasses on everyone&#x27;s head? Cameras everywhere giving you a ticket as soon as you speed over the limit for 10 seconds? (Don&#x27;t laugh, we already have many tollbooths implementing speeding tickets by simply timing how long it took you to get from one to the next.) Cameras in every parking lot signaling the tow truck as soon as you leave? 3d printing guns from models? Anyone able to release a virus on a subway? Etc etc.<p>I&#x27;ve always said that terrorism is a problem of technology. 1000 years ago it was literally impossible for 5 people to kill 1000, but nowadays our society will begin more and more to watch everyone. As it becomes easier, surveillance (and, what&#x27;s more unnerving, automatic curation and analysis by computers!!) will become an accepted part of life.

Alright, that&#x27;s cool...<p>I would guess that most who pay attention realize that the problems of the world are political on the surface. Like always, most people flock elsewhere because they feel powerless to change a political issue with direct political action. Plus, questioning authority is scary.<p>However, it all ends up being more sociological than political. The ideal behind the US involved the citizenry being able and willing to regulate the government, by whatever means, when the time came. This was done with the knowledge that power can corrupt and turn people into abusers, coming from people who were living under an abusive power. This hasn&#x27;t been realized on a large scale in any recent event.<p>Now we&#x27;re staring down 10 years of really, really bad ideas that have stripped us of even more rights and have destroyed many literal and implicit ideals of the Constitution, and only now does a sizable portion of the population look back and say, &quot;Well, <i>shit!</i>&quot;<p>If you fixed the government with the snap of your fingers, the problems would reinvent themselves given enough time.

I believe whole-heartedly that the state is inevitable.<p>Thus, the majority of the developed world&#x27;s problems are humans. We&#x27;ve had the same problems with a revolution bringing enlightened ideals that are slowly corrupted and taken away by a bloated, crumbling empire many times over. History is one giant, depressing cycle.<p>I think the most realistic hope is to keep finding ways to build a state that insure as much independence and individuality as possible, while protecting given rights from the wills of those in power or those others in the said state.<p>An enlightened society of individualists able to get along from day to day using only voluntary interactions, who don&#x27;t care about stepping on others for power (and don&#x27;t have any sanctioned way to do so) is a nice ideal, but one I don&#x27;t see coming true without some drastic level of human evolution.",1377024736

It sounds like the typical problems involved in scheduling 10 people to all perform together at once.  Nobody can prevent people from getting sick.  Going out of town and missing an interview is pretty flaky, but it happens.  You can look it as &quot;Google is evil and wants to torture candidates&quot; or &quot;people are flaky&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s certainly human nature to be bitter about someone fucking up an important day for you, but ultimately, bitterness gets you nothing.  It&#x27;s no problem if you want to complain to your friends or on HN, but why not come back for the second try?  Your friend could have had another free trip to Mountain View to actually be interviewed properly, and maybe get the job he wanted.  (They do pay pretty well at Google, after all; the interviews aren&#x27;t for some volunteer position.)<p>(As for the calculus interview, that sounds like fair game.  PMs are supposed to have some PM interviews and some SWE interviews, and math is a perfectly acceptable area to ask SWE candidates.  It&#x27;s not where <i>I</i> would spend <i>my</i> time, but that&#x27;s part of the process that people hate; different interviewers have different preferred questions.  I would probably have asked &quot;how do you test that&quot;, which would probably raise a few eyebrows in a story like this too.  But ultimately, having that understanding is something I value in future coworkers, so it&#x27;s what I&#x27;d ask about in interviews.)<p>Finally, if you have any questions about the hiring process at all, feel free to send me an email, jrockway AT google.com.  I&#x27;m not a recruiter, I&#x27;m a programmer who cares about making the process work, but I&#x27;ll try to help you out!",1377024708

6245760,comment,6240474,6245323,1,0,rdtsc,,,"> Threads have a similar problem: if you use them, you&#x27;re stuck using thread-safe libraries.<p>One pattern that I like personally is the actor pattern. Building systems out of independent isolated concurrent components that share data _mostly_ by sending messages. Erlang at the top of this paradigm but one can replicate that in other languages and libraries. There is Akka for Scala and others as well. It is basically an object, a thread running one of its methods and a queue.  This object also has an address or handle. Objects communicate by sending messages to each other&#x27;s handles.<p>Now of course as you say one needs to use libraries that allow this concurrency.<p>So far I find this pattern best matches real world scenarios. Real world is built of many concurrent pieces but each individual piece could be a small sequential island. This doesn&#x27;t apply just to intelligent agents but to server requests as well. Each client connection and context can be sequential but it can run concurrently with other potential client context.<p>Ideally if one such client request crashes it shouldn&#x27;t crash the main OS process. If one such client goes into a tight loop it shouldn&#x27;t block the rest of the requests. This is hard to do without sacrificing heavily by copying data and or using isolated heaps (can use real OS processes up to some point, but also it is very resource heavy).<p>> That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re talking about twisted-compatible libraries and not just python libraries, and why this a non-issue with node.js database libraries.<p>Very good point. I didn&#x27;t think of it that way. Say if Python was born with Twisted bolted on to start we wouldn&#x27;t be having this problem. But it is interesting how a mono-culture of concurrency is a good thing in certain respects. And to give Guido props I think he is trying to bring that in -- as with Python, it is desirable to have one best way to do the same thing. Concurrency wasn&#x27;t like that historically. And he is trying to fix it. I personally disagree with the approach he took (either in promoting or looking at deferred or explicit co-routines based on generators)",1377024679

The cost wasn&#x27;t just for a standard server, much of that came from the number of datastore reads I was performing, since the original backend wasn&#x27;t using memcache the best, etc.  It also wasn&#x27;t syncing in the most efficient way, so that added a lot of overhead.  There is still room for improvement, but just with a weekend of optimization, I&#x27;ve been able to reduce the cost by an order of magnitude.

6245649,comment,6243946,6244459,12,0,ufo,,,"The main benefit of coroutines is avoiding inversion of control flow.<p>A classic example is iterators. Its very natural to write an iterator like<p><pre><code>    for(i=0; i<10; i++){
       yield i
    }
</code></pre>
But to program the same thing without coroutines you need to keep all the control flow state explicitly and write the logic inside out like a state machine:<p><pre><code>    i = 0
    int getNext(){
        if(i >= 10){
           return Done
        }else{
           temp = i
           i = i + 1
           return temp
        }
    }
</code></pre>
This inversion of control gets worse the more complicated your control flow is. For example if you have a recursive structure<p><pre><code>    iterate_tree(t){
        if(t.isLeaf){
           yield t.value
        }else{
           iterate_tree(t.left)
           yield t.key
           iterate_tree(t.right)
        }
    }
</code></pre>
then you suddenly need to also keep a bunch of stacks as your control flow state instead of just a single integer. I wont even try to write it because its just <i>that</i> ugly!<p>---------<p>One way to prevent the inversion of control is to use internal iterators, where  you pass a code block to the iterator:<p><pre><code>    void iterate(callback){
       for(i=0; i<10; i++){
          callback(i)
       }
    }
</code></pre>
This works just fine sometimes but there are limitations: you cant&#x27;t break out of the iteration at the middle and you cant interweave to iterations in parallel. Another situation where you see this kind of limitation is Javascript. Using callbacks to do async IO is better than writing everything inside out with all state in global variables (like you would do in C) but its a PITA to do simple things like chaining async calls one after the other inside a loop For example, with coroutines you could do something looking like<p><pre><code>    foreach(url in list){
       var x = await getUrl(url)
       console.log(x)
    }
    restOfTheCode();
</code></pre>
while in regular JS you need to use recursive functions instead:<p><pre><code>    function go(i){
        if(i >= urls.length){
           restOfTheCode();
        }else{
           getUrl(function(x){
               print(x)
               go(i+1)
           })
        }
    }</code></pre>",1377023650

We agreed right off the beginning what role exactly I&#x27;m interviewing for(Test Engineer), different from what I applied for(SDET) and went with it. Note, that I was holding them off for about 2 years. They&#x27;d email/call me every 6-8 months, and I&#x27;d say &quot;Hold on, gimme a few more months&quot;. Eventually stuff happened that caused me to email them back and say &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s do this.&quot;
 I had the first typical phone-screening, talking about myself &#x27;n such, why I&#x27;m looking for another job, why Google, etc. They gave me a bunch of blog links to &quot;Life as a TE at Google&quot; &#x27;n stuff. 2nd phone screening was a programming thing that was kinda hard but not out-of-bounds PhD stuff. I was a bit intimidated by the fact I spent the whole hour on a question that was labeled &quot;Question#1&quot;. I asked about it, the SoftEng. told me &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t worry about that&quot;. I asked if there were more questions, he said again not to worry... hmm. I did talk a lot though so he knew what I was thinking while trying to code.
 Anyways, a week later I get an email from a Google recruiter saying the SoftEng thought I knew what I was doing so we set up the MTV visit with 5 or 6 people. I was super-excited I made it to the on-site visit. Did you know Google Maps on mobile behaves differently if you&#x27;re on campus? :) Everything happened on time.
 The interview questions and conversations we had for those 6 hours were great, eye-opening for me. I will say that I went into this whole Google thing with an open mind and with the assumption that all these people had more intelligence in their toe-nail than I&#x27;d ever obtain in my life.
 In the end, 2 weeks later, I was told that they &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be going forward with me&quot;. Of course I was bummed, I didn&#x27;t even tell my family I was interviewing with Google. I wanted it to be a surprise. But, they showed me my weaknesses and I fixed &#x27;em. Now I have an awesome job(SDET2) and I think the only reason I was able to get through this job&#x27;s interview process is because Google&#x27;s interview improved me significantly.",1377023514

But the arc of history has been that America has gotten less imperfect over time. We find NSLs and the resort to esoteric legal defenses on the part of the NSA intolerable today, but those are niceties in the grand scheme of things. Remember, we&#x27;re a country where Bureau of Prohibition agents ransacked peoples&#x27; physical property looking for alcohol in the 1930&#x27;s, a country that put Japanese-Americans in internment in the 1940&#x27;s, a country where the President had to call the national guard down to Alabama to get the governor to comply with a federal court order.

That&#x27;s hysteria.<p>It should be noted that the surveillance programs seem pretty designed to stay on the right side of existing Supreme Court precedent. That&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of the government doing &quot;literally anything&quot; it wants. That doesn&#x27;t mean what its doing is right, but trying to skirt through holes in the law is very different from ignoring the law.

I have talked with people in real life about the depression aspect and even my self mutilation, but very few people know about my &quot;schizo&quot; part of my illness.

I think overall what&#x27;s kind of silly about this is you&#x27;re taking something that realistically is extremely abstract to the vast majority of people (how many of use are dealing with Snowden&#x27;s problems on a personal level here?) and applying it to a whole country and it&#x27;s people.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think people should be angry with what&#x27;s been happening, the eroding of the American dream, increased inequality, the continued militarization of the police and it&#x27;s overall unaccountability, lack of privacy from both the government <i>and</i> businesses (let&#x27;s not forget what type of data the Google&#x27;s and Facebook&#x27;s of the world legally have on you).  It&#x27;s going to take indignation and anger to result in the action that might change things.<p>But, to turn around and say some thing like &quot;America is dead&quot;?  No, personally I see things that make me proud of my fellow Americans, the goals they&#x27;re accomplishing, the big dreams they have, the relationships they develop and grow from.  I see those things happening on this forum everyday.  No, to me America is around and kicking all around, the proof is right here in front of you, and it&#x27;s worth fighting for. I&#x27;m not willing to write it off just yet.",1377023362

I think there&#x27;s two ways this works: 1) Killer content is created and social shares quickly give signals of freshness and quality within an area. Combine that with early user metrics as the content moves up and you have a good idea of it&#x27;s quality. However, if this content is not soon backed with corresponding signals (links, etc.) the ranking can fade. This is likely dependent on the industry and topic as to how it plays out.<p>The other possibility is a good piece of content earns links, has great user metrics for certain keywords, lives on a great site, etc. and ranks well. It then accumulates social shares on top of that, further confirming the quality  of the content.  Thus...you get a situation like #3. Social signals make sense for indexation, but beyond that, until you start to understand the importance of the author (cough, AuthorRank, cough) then you can&#x27;t use them for much more then understanding what the &quot;mob&quot; is finding valuable at the moment.

Good companies know who their value-adders are and they reward them accordingly.

You end up losing a small amount of accuracy, the worst being for keeping track of the second counts. You can avoid that by using an actual list of counter values for the seconds bucket and dumping those out when they get older than a second, or maybe by introducing another subdivision -- 1/10th of a second probably is good -- so that you actually have .9 seconds worth of data and can interpolate the last bit.",1377022627

6245453,comment,6243936,6245164,1,0,malandrew,,,"I would imagine that any shared mailboxes should be capped to force mailbox rotation at the exact same time. Once a mailbox hits a predetermined limit, all the peers refuse to accept additional messages. Basically the exodus of users from a mailbox should happen all at the same time. Those users then randomly choose any of the other new mailboxen out there being formed. You would never be with the same cohort from one mailbox to the next. A few hundred randomly allocated and rotated monthly should help. I need to go back through that presentation again. Anyone thinking about anonymity should read it. It&#x27;s brilliant.<p>The other thing we need is a way to easily handle multiple keys so that if one key is comprimised then we only get up a small amount of data. Ideally we would want one key per contact, but this of course would be prohibitively expensive computationally because I&#x27;d have to compare every message in that 10GB against every key I have per person. However being able to have maybe a half dozen public keys randomly distributed among your contact list would help. A totalitarian government forcing key disclosure with the threat of jail time would have to have all your public keys to determine whether or not you have disclosed all the information you have received. This would do the same for shared mailboxes as Truecrypt did for deniability that additional partitions exist. You can even distribute your keys among the different bootable Truecrypt volumes you have.<p>At the end of the day, public key disclosure shouldn&#x27;t be a lookup but a give a key, get a key system. Basically, I would submit a new public key to you via some secure web interface
which would deliver a one time message to you at the shared mailbox you&#x27;re using. At some later date, you generate a new public key for communicating with me (or use one of your current keys in rotation) and send me a message that contains the address of the mailbox I&#x27;m currently using and that key which I should use until I revoke it or issue a new one.<p>Ultimately we need a system that disguises how many people we are communicating with, partitions those people with multiple keys, that affords me plausible deniability since an attacker wouldn&#x27;t know how many keys or mailboxes I&#x27;m using and where the level of security I am afforded is only bounded by the disk space, bandwidth and CPU time I&#x27;m willing to throw at the problem. This scales with paranoia.<p>On top of that we need a system that provides us temporal security. If all my files and communications are partitioned cryptographically by date, I can aquiesce to a warrant that specifically details the dates in which they are interested instead of giving them everything I have. If they have a specific crime they are investigating (which they should have), then they should be able to state the specific date ranges that contain the evidence they are looking for.

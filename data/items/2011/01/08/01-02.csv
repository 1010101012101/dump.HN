Simplifying and standardizing login/identification is obviously a worthwhile goal, and has been pursued by several projects already. I would much rather have an open, transparent standard than see something like facebook login become a de-facto standard.<p>It would be terrible (in addition to potential privacy/big-brother issues), however, if the system ended up favoring large providers like Google and Amazon and Apple over potential competitors, because of barriers to entry into the system or onerous implementation costs. We will need a lot more information to make a judgment about the benefits and risks.",1294451850

It's entirely possible that companies have tested and they know that requiring users to take two explicit actions (free-trial signup & entering payment details) instead of just getting it all done at once will result in a lower conversion rate. That's just human nature, and I'm not sure that acknowledging it is ""consumer unfriendly"".<p>The main problem I have with your logic is that it makes the very concept of subscription services ""consumer unfriendly"". Why rebill customers every month for anything?

I can't wait until it's ready to use!""<p>Here's what Zed Shaw says this is for: application developers who are so uncertain as to whether they can hash passwords properly that they'd rather outsource that service to someone who can hash passwords properly... and nothing else.<p>Here's what I think: if every piece of this is served via SSL, or if you don't really care about account security but just don't want to be keeping a database of passwords just so people can leave comments on a CMS, you stand a chance of not making your service less secure by using it --- not a very good chance, but a chance.<p>If, by the way, you serve every piece of content on any page that touches this API or that could ever be cached and touched by a page that touches that API through SSL --- which is what you <i>have to do for this to stand any chance of being secure</i> --- you already have a secure channel to send passwords to your application.<p>Personally, I think it's so easy to safely store passwordsâ€  and there are so many moving parts in this design that I can't fathom why anyone would opt into it. This is a project that at first glance appears to offer immense value, but really offers a truly marginal bit of value.<p>I'm really tired of being down on Zed Shaw. It's really nothing personal. I'll go a step further and say that this is one of the very few SRP implementations I've seen that didn't have a variant of a common auth bypass flaw. It's not bad code. But unfortunately, Zed is wading into the fever swamp of Javascript crypto, and it's worth calling this out just so other people don't have the impression that This Is Something We Do Now.<p>â€  <a href=""http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a>",1294449688

Itâ€™s a reality of statistics that scientists will from time to time get wrong results; that and possible methodological problems leave all scientific results (except maybe the most obvious ones) up in the air until they have been confirmed again and again and again. (Psychology could also pick a smaller alpha value like maybe physicists and avoid being wrong more often but itâ€™s questionable how practical such a change would be.)<p>Still, this is a neat DIY experiment. There is quite a bit you can criticize about the methodology but that discussion was pretty fun. Oh, and this experiment doesnâ€™t even seem to confirm ESP. (I think. I didnâ€™t break out the calculator.)",1294449644

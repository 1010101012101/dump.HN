10962362,comment,10957614,10962339,0,0,lunula,,,"Obviously this is purely anecdotal. I have the same habits as the author with respect to light exposure regulation. I live in England and take an hour walk every day around noon regardless of weather. At night I avoid computers for about two hours before bedtime and although I do not read paper books (I should find my local library...) I set a screen filter on my amoled phablet and often invert the text so it shows white on black. I exclusively use a red LED at night for lighting. This all helps a lot, bit the thing that seems most striking is vitamin D. Sometimes I feel down and realize I haven&#x27;t had exposure to many sources for a while. A few days of heavy doses and my mood improves. I don&#x27;t take it orally all the time, just as I imagine I need it. The effect is sublte but it would be cool if someone could figure out how to quanitfy.<p>As a result of all this care about light I haven&#x27;t had a SAD winter for most of a decade. I feel &quot;cured&quot; of it enough that spending time in even more northerly places in the winter does not trigger unpleasant depression. That said, us northern peoples should slow down in the winter. Thousands of years of selection has driven this home, and it is nothing to be upset about. We will make up for the slowness of the winter in the long days of summer.",1453639896

If there&#x27;s a line of writing I don&#x27;t like, I&#x27;ll cross it out and start that piece over.<p>If you want to get faster and better at sketching diagrams I&#x27;d recommend you practice some of the basic techniques that say concept artists use. Straight lines from the elbow with little wrist movement and a little practice, and you&#x27;ll be drawing things in no time in no time. Unless I need an incredibly straight line, I usually forgo rulers at this point.<p>If your handwriting has slowed down, or you&#x27;re cramping, you might want to give that a little bit of practice as well. No need for the cleanest Suetterlin, but getting posture right and yourself up to speed might be worth the time investment. I&#x27;ve been playing around with the palmer method recently, it seems quite nice for this purpose.<p>Then there&#x27;s tools. You don&#x27;t want to be writing with cheap ballpoint pens on rough paper. The lines don&#x27;t come out properly, which will make you press harder, which leads to fatigue. My current favourite pens are the Uniball eye-fine which is my go to for writing, as its a very smooth disposable ink pen. I&#x27;ve got one of those in front of me with a Kum ergonomic grip. Fountain pens are also very nice, and an entry level Lamy, Pelikan or Pilot will serve you nicely, but they&#x27;re more suited for linear writing as they may smudge.<p>Pencils are nice for sketching, but you have to sharpen them, which is annoying. For regular use I use a Faber-Castell Grip 1345 0.5mm mechanical pencil, which is still affordable but doesn&#x27;t have many of the issues that cheaper mechanical pencils suffer from (broken leads, leads going back in because of insufficient internal grip, etc.). The Faber-Castel leads are also very nice and sturdy and make decent lines even at low pressures.<p>Paper isn&#x27;t that variable, as long as you don&#x27;t totally cheap out on it. I&#x27;m particular to .5cm grid paper, but there&#x27;s circumstances when plain white is nicer to work on.<p>It&#x27;s a bit much of a list, but I think a lot about stationery. You don&#x27;t need all of these, and if you find other tools that do the job for you, then by all means go for them, these are just my personal favourites. One pen and a block of paper is more than sufficient.<p>But I do think coding and thinking through problems on paper is a valuable skill. One neat thing it allows you to do is to go to a different place than the one you type things at to go think deeply about problems, because it&#x27;s a lot more portable than a laptop. If like me, you haven&#x27;t quite figured out how pseudo-code works and still write straight up source code, it also gives you a reason to memorize reserved words which I find does make things quicker (&quot;was it import or include?&quot;). And finally, your IDE won&#x27;t distract you by having the gumption to tell you that &quot;hey, you aren&#x27;t using this variable, you lugnut, lookie look, this import is BROKEN! Aint you got any IntelliSense in you?&quot; when you really want to be thinking about more conceptual things and not tiny implementation details. Sometimes you do do your best work when you&#x27;re away from where you do your regular work.",1453637571

It&#x27;s much more precise than using a power tool and it&#x27;s easier to control the speed and torque to avoid tearout. It&#x27;s also useful when removing the bulk of the waste for joinery such as dados or mortises, before finishing the job with a chisel or a router plane or such.<p>A drill press is better if you have one available and the workpiece is small enough to fit. I wouldn&#x27;t choose a hand tool for bigger construction projects if there&#x27;s a very large number of holes to be drilled or screws to be attached.",1453637359

The &quot;discipline&quot; is just a tool to reach the goal. You can see this in the evolution of Rust: the goal hasn&#x27;t changed, but the tool used to (try to) reach it has. (I know that you mention ignoring the chronology, but ignoring the intent doesn&#x27;t make sense.)<p>Put another way: Rust isn&#x27;t <i>aiming</i> to be top of the pack in terms of enforcing a certain programming style, where as it is aiming to be top of the pack in terms of safe systems programming.

71655,comment,71469,71469,0,0,geebee,,,"Nice article. I'd also recommend checking out a couple of other neighborhoods:<p>Glen Park is near a bart station and has a small but reasonably entertaining center with restaurants, a small (high end) grocery store, and a couple of coffee shops/bars.  You're also a very short hop from the mission (fairly cheap cab ride, 5 mins in the car).  The nice thing is that it is extremely easy to get downtown on Bart (10-15min), but you're also in the southern half of the city near the freeway - so if you need to get to silicon valley, you don't have to battle city traffic.  <p>Another cheaper option along the same lines is to live near Balboa Park - there's a bart station, a few good muni corridor lines.  Transportation-wise, it's similar to Glen Park - quick strike to the peninsula, quick bart ride to downtown/berkeley.  On the down side, this section is on the outer edge of San Francisco's rougher neighborhoods. But rents here will be lower.  ",1193156650

This one takes place during the reception and  banquet dinner. <p>Ramachandran discusses phantom limbs and synesthesia (esp. color-blind synesthete) as a function of neuron innervation. Specifically, he focuses on cross-linking between nearby cortical regions, which he believes to be genetically caused (e.g. synesthesia appears to be found frequently in family lineages). He also discusses the link between mirror neurons and autism, and how language invention is due to an inherent cross-linking between portions of the visual and auditory regions (e.g. Buba/Kiki effect).</quote>",1193155308
71645,comment,71608,71631,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yeah Kant isn't the end of that discussion. And you hit the ball out of the park with your example. As you can see, I qualified it with a variant on the golden rule. I also pointed out the goal of both maxims was creating the most utilitarian value. I would argue that those bad guys -- you know the ones with the cool uniforms with leather boots and the strange salute who worshiped that guy with the mustache -- were way off base. You can argue that killing the Jews should be a universal law, but you can't argue that one bunch of people trying to kill an entire other bunch of people for subjective reasons is a good thing for society at large or is something that should be repeated.",1193155260
71644,comment,71608,71631,0,0,amalcon,,,"This is a misapplication of the categorical imperative.  Of course, I suspect that you knew that; it's only a naive viewpoint that would cause someone to miss that.<p>The correct ""universal law"" to use in this case, would be ""Eliminating people who you find problematic.""   It would take a truly insane person to actually want this as a universal law.  Tying the rule to any specific group of people makes it not universal.<p>Of course, if someone only understands ""philosophy-lite,"" it becomes an easy thing to mix up.",1193155255

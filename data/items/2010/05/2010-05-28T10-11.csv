He received most money from individual BP employees, but received no money from BP itself for his presidential campaign, as he took no money from corporations or their political action committees and lobbyists. The fact that Obama received most money from BP individual employees is not surprising because he got record donations from individuals in general.<p>Also, the whole thing will have very little to do with Obama. BP will pay according to the law on the books and the way judges enforce/construe that law.<p>Obama will probably campaign to change the law, but that will not affect the treatment of the spill because ex post facto laws are usually considered unconstitutional in the US.

Every year the same bunch of people take several months touring the country. It is not very expensive.

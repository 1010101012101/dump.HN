I'm far from knowledgeable about formal methods but, in my understanding, if they're writing provably correct programs the code should, by definition, contain no 'errors'. (That is, it should always ""do the thing right"". There's no guarantee they've designed it to ""do the right thing"". Design errors may be exactly what the article is talking about.)<p>I'm not sure exactly what you mean when you say ""every single possible input is tested"". I would claim that this is not only impractical but impossible. The range of possible inputs to a system is infinite. This may sound pedantic, but in my experience as a software tester all sorts of failures often pop up when you look even slightly outside the range of values that seems sensible/likely/exhaustive for a given input.",1231303979

If you don't need recurring billing and are a US merchant, then it is an acceptable substitute.  (I won't say superior, for a variety of reasons -- it is cheaper, free if you use AdWords, but has its own share of headaches.)<p>Credentials: I sold about $10,000 on each in last 12 months.<p>Edit: I realize that vaguely saying ""It has problems"" doesn't help anyone here make decisions.  Let me elaborate:<p>* Google has a Buyer's Remorse feature, which allows a customer to yank back a transaction up to 20 minutes after making it.  I don't mind -- I have a 30 day money back guarantee -- but some people probably would.  (I also have gotten burned once or twice when people Buyer's Remorse a CD that already got shipped -- I have no convenient way to recall a CD order after it gets sent to the processor's computer.  I write that off as a cost of doing business, but it is friction and I hate friction.)<p>* Google has this ""customer friendly"" option which it labels as ""Opt Out Of Marketing Messages From This Merchant"".  A more accurate label would be ""Hide Your Real Email Address From This Merchant So When You Ask Him For Your Account Details In A Year He Has No Clue Who You Are"".<p>* Google once opted me in to showing a post-transaction upsell (to some sort of environmentalist indulgence -- carbon offset or something) on Earth Day.  They included instructions for opting out in an email they sent me, which I did immediately.  I wrote a letter On Dead Tree (TM) to express how strongly I feel that they should not make their political statements during the middle of business transactions which I am paying them for.  (Any customer who mistakenly clicked the button would find it nearly impossible to navigate back to the software they just paid me for.  Guess whose problem that is?  Guess who they think is trying to be a pushy git and sell them a carbon offset totally unrelated to my actual product?)  If Google wants to interrupt someone's browsing experience to offset a carbon offset, I hear they have some web traffic of their own who they can bother.<p>* Ironically, their search interface sucks.

If you want answers as to what schools look for in students start by looking at CV's of students in the department.  More specifically, look at students in the research areas you may be interested in.  This is probably the single best resource available to you.  I knew my weaknesses (non top 10 undergraduate school, several years in industry, no undergraduate research experience, relatively unknown letter writers, and a non-CS undergraduate degree) and adjusted my expectations accordingly (ie I knew I wasn't going to get in a top 10 school despite high grades, good industry job, and perfect quant gre).<p>1. 0 years.  There are a number of reasons from familiarity with your letter writers to the lack of commitment if you work in a non-research position.<p>2. If you are working in a research position and could publish that is ideal.  However, I doubt this type of position will be available to you (usually it requires a phd).  In terms of acceptance I believe industry experience is nearly meaningless.  There are plenty of reasons to do it for personal reasons, but look at the CV's of current students at the schools you are targeting and look at how many of them worked between undergrad and grad.<p>3. Again, a research position is probably the only type of position that will help you in the admissions process.  It may give you access to significant letter writers, a chance to be an author, etc..<p>4. I presume that status implies a significant contribution.

And mine refuses to allow passwords to be one-way hashes (his words: we must be able to email the user the password they use). Depending on the security you need, the user of a locked account either has to phone up an unhelp desk, or show up in person.<p>8 - UserAgreementID - As you change user agreements, you'll want to keep track of what agreement the user agreed to, what day and time. This is something you'll want to log, and if you make substantial changes to the user agreement, you may want to force them to re-agree to the terms of use.

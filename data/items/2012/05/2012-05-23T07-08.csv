It's not large, and I'm not claiming high quality either, but it might be educational to read and poke at as a beginner.<p>It's a very simple game built as a webapp in the very simple Noir framework (webnoir.org). It also contains unit tests. It uses leiningen as a build tool (so you can simply run it using ""lein run"" or poke at using ""lein repl"", run the unit tests using ""lein test"" etc). As a next exercise I want to build it in ClojureScript (client side only), which should not be too hard.",1337759874

4012038,comment,4011550,4011925,1,0,Peteris,,,"Haven't read that one myself, I learned mostly from Introduction to Algorithms and online tutorials. I would suggest having a go at TopCoder problems. It's a bit of a pain to set up, but once you have, there are practice rooms with problems from past contests. Written up solutions are available too. It helps you learn to design algorithms for unseen problems, which is ultimately what we're after. There are a lot of essential small tricks and methods that these problems contain and algorithm books don't get to cover at all.<p>Also, competing is a good idea. It helps you evaluate yourself and there's more motivation to do well. Having a rating of 1500, say, would place you in a good position to crack even the most competitive phone interviews.<p>I did TopCoder for a few years in high school, and now I can confidently and quickly get most of the algorithmic questions that companies ask. It takes a while to get there, but it's worth it.",1337759824

And the other day, as it happened with VW stock in Germany, the sue others when their gambles don't work.<p>What I remeber from the VW stock story happened back then was the following. Porsche tried to take over VW, so they bought every stock they could. Hedge funds bet on falling values and sold VW stock short. Since Porsche continued buying, stock prices raised. Then the hedge funds had to buy the stock short selled, values raised further (up to 1k  if I remeber well). The result were funds obliged to buy stock for almost 1K they sold earlier for a fracture of that.<p>And after that they sued Porsche for stock manipulation. Yes, these guys are funny.

It maybe enough for some analysts to not understand your business model and your stock value drops way down. On the other hand, if analysts like it stocks go up. And that doesn't tell anything about the actual quality of your business model.<p>Equaly pointless but at least more entertaining were the list of what Apple could buy with its 100 bn in cash.<p>Interessting point in case: The soaring stock price of the german TV set maker (Loewe I think it was) after someone claimed they where about to de bought by Apple. Did the value of their assets change over night? No.<p>Now, FBs stock drops because people say they don't see any actual value behind and the stock was actually overvalued right from the start. Maybe it was I don't know. But nobody complains when stock drop because some banks say they don't belief in future prospects. So it seems to me the same people choose their arguments only to fit the current situation.<p>Not all of them of course, the really good ones (W. Buffet among others) act diffrently.",1337758869

I never liked MySpace or SourceForge, so if I had the option in front of me, I would have passed even at the peak of their popularity.<p>This is the criteria after which I judge companies:<p>(+) is the product solving a real problem for me?

</code></pre>
My point wasn't about loyalty. Developers tend to use the best tool for the job. I still use Google's search engine, even though alternatives are available, because Google still gives me the best results. And this creates a cycle - because I use Google and I optimize my websites for Google and because I use Google's Analytics and the Webmasters tool, Google gets more data with which it can optimize my results better than anybody else can.<p>The same goes for GitHub. Even if I stopped being a GitHub customer, I would still go to GitHub because most popular projects are managed on GitHub or have a mirror there. Popularity in turn helps GitHub get valuable feedback, which it can use to further improve my experience, which in turn makes me a happier customer and so on.",1337757047

This is a case of an individual who has been stalking and harassing multiple people for over a decade.  The police have done precious little because they, by their own admission, have no idea what to do (other than issue PPOs, which aren't enforceable over the Internet) or how to catch him.  This is the state of the art.  This is an /Internet/ issue because, the giant, blazing, un-asked question is:<p>If we want to maintain a free and open Internet, how do we then police our own egalitarian, meritocratic anarchism without relying on big brother technologies to do it or inviting governments in to intervene?  If someone approaches those with the know-how to help, asking for help, and are summarily told to fuck off, who then should they turn to?<p>Though I'm sure they exist, I don't know any hacker types or friends of the Internet who want to just hand over ammunition to people who want to regulate the Internet more.  So, please, try to take a long view on this issue, even if Rachel can be kind of a drama queen.",1334462290

I'm sure everyone here recognizes that as a maturity/self-control thing, but it comes easier for some than others.

He still randomly mails shit-o-grams from throw-away yahoo or gmail accounts to my old email accounts.  I just learned to ignore him and forward the lulz back to the abuse department of his provider.<p>Unfortunately Rachel, when faced with this guy on Kickstarter, thought she needed to tell her supporters what was going on.

3842638,comment,3842525,3842584,4,0,nateps,,,"I can't speak for Meteor as much, but Derby's bindings support pretty much everything that Knockout and Ember can do. The big difference is how you connect the bindings to model data. Knockout has a generic API that you can pass pretty much any JSON data to. This is flexible, but you end up having to write a lot of glue code to hook it up to whatever type of model you use. Ember bindings only work with Ember models. Derby automatically knows to look in its model to bind data.<p>Knockout is pretty minimal and fast, Ember has not performed very well in update intensive benchmarks. From our testing so far, Derby is somewhere in the middle if you bind everything, but it has granular control of bindings so you can get it to perform about as fast as Knockout.<p>This is just one small part of synchronizing clients, and Derby takes care of realtime data syncing as well. Synching data with ember requires a lot of manual server implementation. In addition, Ember and Knockout don't have any way of supporting server-side rendering, while Derby automatically renders everything in both the client and on the server.<p>You are right that you can't partially implement OT. The way that we handle it is by keeping OT operations on defined paths so that they are separately namespaced from other kinds of updates.",1334460516

It's not, although using computers is a great way to teach the actual concepts underlying the exercise.<p>Fundamentally (and one would hope that this part is made clear to students, teachers, administrators and parents), what is being taught and learned is a method for developing procedures. And I don't mean ""procedures"" in the context of computation, but procedures in general. I'm talking about the act of dividing a task into its component bits, determining what has to happen in what order, and deciding when things are ""done"" (whether that's in the sense of being absolutely complete or ""close enough for government work"").<p>Those are skills almost everyone needs in life.

They treat <i>everybody</i> like crap.<p>On the other hand, they are very scrupulous about obeying licenses.<p>Anyway, the underlying assumption of the OP is that Wikimedia Commons actually wants more images. Surprisingly, this is not the case, at least, it's not a universal sentiment among Commons volunteers. Many of them believe they are curating a set of the best free images, not making an indiscriminate collection. Some see Commons as just a set of images to illustrate Wikipedia with, and don't believe it has a separate mission to collect other free imagery.<p>Also, Commons is already overwhelmed policing the content that gets uploaded. Unlike Flickr or other image hosts, there's no mission of self-expression there; instead, they believe every image must be correctly licensed, well categorized, and useful to someone else (and not spam or otherwise inappropriate). What's needed right now are more community tools for managing the influx.<p>You're right that there's no way we can explain CC licensing to eBayers. We can't even get that right on Flickr, and there are significant problems even on Wikimedia Commons itself. No matter what you tell people, make them click on, whatever, they persist in a primitive folk belief - by creating the image, they get to control who does what with it in perpetuity.",1334459175

But David himself says at the beginning of the text: &quot;I made a thousand decisions, large and small, that seemed reasonable at the time but cumulatively led to our situation.&quot;<p>Of course it&#x27;s easy to analyze what went wrong after the fact. But it&#x27;s not easy to see the trends when you&#x27;re amid them. (Continuously monitoring the ongoing trends is one of the advices in the Book of five rings. A pile of small seemingly incremental changes amounts to a big shift. It&#x27;s hard to notice them when they happen over an extended period of time.)",1384847935

6759829,comment,6756614,6758741,8,0,crdoconnor,,,"The Chinese are not acquiring USD and treasuries so that they can own spendable assets. They are doing so in order to push the value of their currency down, so that their export goods become more competitive.<p>This is done because while currency fluctuations and inflation can jump and fall hugely overnight, an industrial base takes DECADES to build up and decades to destroy. China is planning for the long term.<p>If there ever comes a point where the US industrial base has been effectively destroyed and China makes everything, they can stop the treasury buying and start cashing in. Inflation in the US will go NUTS and the US will have to build an industrial base from scratch -- starting essentially in China&#x27;s position circa 1980. Not a happy place.<p>China will have lost trillions following this strategy, but the US will effectively stop being a strategic or military threat if it is followed through to its logical conclusion.<p>Bitcoin is not a godsend to the Chinese government, as it creates a means to let capital exit the country (which they are desperately trying to prevent).",1384847904

The difference is that there are hundrends of ways to touch someone, and thousand of circumstances where you do so. So any particular form is just one of many.<p>On the other hand, you carry your face and its&#x27; facial expression constantly, and your expression is the most basic form of interaction you have with another person socially, with talking as distant second. Furthermore, there are few expressions, are (almost?) all are universal, like smiling and crying.<p>Heck, you could live in the same room with a person for a month, with all kinds of normal interaction (eating, talking, etc) and never one touch him/her, and much less in any socially meaningful way (like holding hands or hugging).

Our $100 million has now become $16 million per year. Developing the controller is going to involve a lot of people: software, hardware, QA, design, supply chain, fabrication, etc.<p>Let&#x27;s say that Microsoft has a team of a hundred people working on the controller (personally I think that&#x27;s a very conservative guess). So of our $16 million we&#x27;ve easily eaten up half of that in labour costs. Prototyping, gearing and tooling up, and all the various other expenses associated with  designing and manufacturing electronics eats the rest up pretty quickly.<p>This is obviously &#x27;back of the napkin&#x27;, hugely simplified conjecture, but I can definitely see how $100 million becomes a fairly reasonable figure over time.",1384847598

6759815,comment,6758115,6759118,2,0,emidln,,,"From a practical perspective, Clojure is pretty close to Python in day to day usage. The largest difference to adapt to for me (and a couple others that I worked with), was the absence of the imperative-style for loop/yield keyword combination in Python. To get something similar, you tend to need to rewrite into something with lazy-seq/loop+recur. Everything else (for work doing web development, data processing, and internal API development) is pretty close with favorable points to each depending on the task.<p>If you were already writing pure functions in python and then creating data flows using generator expressions or list comprehensions, moving to Clojure is very natural. If you aren&#x27;t, and if your job is to move bits from one place to another performing transformations along the way, you were already having issues in Python and might want to consider the approach regardless of the particular language employed.",1384847463

I don&#x27;t have figures for this year, but last year Microsoft&#x27;s R&D budget (as listed in their annual report) was $9.4 billion, compared to Google ($5.2 billion) and Apple ($2.6 billion).<p>One explanation is Microsoft simply account for R&D differently. Another explanation is that Microsoft overspend on R&D, or spend very poorly. Microsoft have always spent very highly on R&D, but over the past few years haven&#x27;t had much to show for it in terms of growth or success.<p>I am sure there is some hyperbole and creative maths in the report to get to $100 million, but where you see Microsoft investing money to perfect the almost perfect, I see Microsoft spending far too much money on the wrong things.",1384847200

A Groovy object can subclass a Java object and vice versa.<p>Groovy is perfect for Java developers who want a gentle learning curve for new language features and want fine-grained interaction with other existing Java (and JVM) libraries and components.<p>JRuby: A full* implementation of JRuby and libraries that runs on the JVM. A Ruby string is not a Java string. JRuby can call Java and vice versa, but there&#x27;s some impedance mismatch because of differences in the object libraries.<p>JRuby is great for Ruby developers and/or people who need to run Ruby-based technologies in the JVM environment (e.g. Rails, Asciidoctor, etc.)<p>Most people knowledgable of both technologies would not view this as (unnecessary) fragmentation.  There has also been some work on the JVM that has benefitted both languages -- most notable the InvokeDynamic byte code additions to better support dynamic languages (benefiting Groovy, JRuby, JavaScript, and others.)<p>* There are some corner-cases where valid Java is not valid Groovy.

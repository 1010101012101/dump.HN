Look to a project like Cyc for one of the best efforts, and most wasted money\n<a href=""http://www.cyc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyc.com/</a><p>You can't build a top down taxonomy of ideas and expect everything too work. You can't just ""hard code"" the ideas.<p>I think building tools from the ground up, with increasingly complicated and capable recognition and modeling, might work. For example, a visual object class recognition suite that first learned faces, phones, cars, etc. and eventually moved on to be able to recognize everything in a scene, might be able to automatically perhaps with some training build up the taxonomy for common sense.",1192835468
70562,comment,69868,70198,0,0,timr,,,"I'm going to ignore your more pedantic points (e.g. method ""signature"" vs. method ""name"", and the silly notion of ""overloading"" in a dynamically typed language), and focus right on the meat of the argument:<p>Every ""experienced Ruby programmer"" may well come to understand that standard expressions fail to mean standard things when used in Ruby;  that doesn't make it a good idiom.  The problem here <i>isn't</i> that the bracket operator fails to reference into an array -- it's that the bracket operator might <i>behave inconsistently</i> for certain subscript values.<p>The STL map class is a perfect analogue:  rather than implement an operator[] than could fail in certain contexts, the C++ standard demands that map::operator[] must <i>always</i> return an object.  This is consistent behavior.  Allowing operator[] to fail for subscript N-1 when it works for N?  That's inconsistent (and confusing), but apparently, it's the Ruby Way.",1192835326

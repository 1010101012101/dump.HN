Considering that virtually every spare differential at every scale is taken advantage of by the body to conduct its work, it&#x27;s not surprising at all to find quantum effects put to work all over the brain.<p>That&#x27;s in the general, but we&#x27;re talking about a specific theory. Your story is also about survivorship bias of scientific theories used as justification for a failure of imagination. Just because while looking for a place to seat consciousness they posited a phenomenon that turned out to take place <i>does not</i> imply that seating. Staking out a claim and adjusting it as information arrives is part of doing good science, but it does not follow that the initial or altered claim is then a good or likely scientific theory.<p>Penrose&#x27;s theories are especially problematic in this area (as opposed to your analogy) because consciousness as a phenomenon is so poorly defined and because of the (many) changes that have been made wrt the physical structures proposed as the mechanisms of his version of consciousness over the years. Fortunately the &quot;objective reduction&quot; is a very specific requirement for consciousness Penrose has laid out, and I see no evidence here that suggests we&#x27;re seeing it in action, nor the additional needed evidence that it itself is necessary for &quot;consciousness&quot;. Implying otherwise is my objection.<p>> <i>P.S. Re the &quot;according to the article&#x27;s narrative&quot; snipe, uhh, some of us have been following this issue since the 90s when the idea was proposed. &quot;You guys are crazy&quot; is an accurate description of the majority consensus.</i><p>I was not denying that there were people saying &quot;You guys are crazy&quot;, I was saying that I have my doubts that there was ever consensus around calling crazy a statement like &quot;there is quantum activity in the microtubules&quot;. See dnautics&#x27;s comment above. &quot;Theory pilloried by scientific community turns out to be true&quot; is a nice narrative, but again: survivorship bias. Most theories turn out to be wrong (and, more crucially, less usefully wrong than accepted theories).",1390017254

It&#x27;s probably worse now.<p>I have a restaurant in East Bay and I have employees on the same side of the bay that will walk 15 more minutes to save 35 cents on BART fares. I pay them more than minimum wage plus overtime and meals, and I offer to pay the 70 cent difference every day since I don&#x27;t want any of them walking alone too late at night.

The beauty of free markets is that they are often, given time, self-correcting (not in all situations, which is one reason we have regulation in general).

I just wanted to bank money.<p>At the time I worked in Edinburgh, next to nice bars and decent food outlets. Yes there was partying and fun (but we also worked hard 12-15 hours a day), but it was on our time, and our dollar (or pound), and when we chose how to party and how much to spend doing that, it wasn&#x27;t the startup&#x27;s time and money or their idea of &quot;fun&quot;, it was our hard earned cash, we spent it how we wanted (or not).<p>I hated that artificial....&quot;startup fun&quot; with pool tables, free drinks, meals etc. At lunchtime I (and my teams) wanted to go for a pint, eat a lunch that wasn&#x27;t decided by the company, and you know, have free-will, and free conversation, outside of the constraints of the startup lunch room, where the founders were lurking all the time, listening in.<p>I didn&#x27;t (and still don&#x27;t) care about perks like laundry, or housecleaning, or in-house meals, healthcare, etc, just pay me properly and let me decide on these things. I&#x27;m (and was already back then) a grown up. I am able to make a sandwich for myself, I can wash my own clothes, and hoover and dust my own flat, when or if I wanted to.<p>I like, and have always liked, doing housework once a week (even in my early 20&#x27;s!), I turn on BBC Radio 4 and listen to catchup radio (Any Questions, Westminster Hour, From Our Own Correspondents, etc) and it&#x27;s peaceful, calming and helps me get away from work for a few hours, and I can reconnect with the <i>real</i> world outside of IT, and then return to the bubble hopefully informed about real things that matter to real people.<p>So, in a nutshell, pay your employees properly, let them decide what their perks are from their salary. All tha perks do is create a work camp in exchange for hard cash, pay your employees properly so they can decide when or if they want their laundry or house cleaning done, or where they wish to eat.<p>The more I hear about SV startup benefits, the more it creeps me out, so please, fuck off, stop becoming a developer nanny state at the expense of paying your employees a proper and fair wage. Also, to the young devs out there being sucked into this nonsense, seriously, start thinking for yourselves and stop enslaving your lives to these faux perks. Demand to be paid fairly and put cash in the bank, forget the foosball table and free drinks, it&#x27;s a distraction.<p>ps: WRT to your employer providing, say, dual 24&quot; monitors, a PC with i7 CPU and a decent chunk of RAM with SSD. It is not a perk, it&#x27;s the tool you need for the job.

7079957,comment,7078181,7078181,4,0,excellence24,,,"&quot;anticipatory shipping&quot;, this is pretty much just saying that local warehouses/stores should anticipate demand by using as much data as possible. For Amazon that means wishlists, viewing history, shopping carts, emails etc. This is good Jeff Bezos, but not good enough. I could do this better.<p>In order to best anticipate demand, they should be trying to make deals with manufactures instead. This system would initially work best with subscription based products. And then we could figure out how to turn everything into a type of subscription.<p>Manufactures have a release cycle that is important to them staying &#x27;competitive&#x27;. So they have to constantly make new models and &#x27;retire&#x27; the old ones by planned obsolescence forcing us to buy the new slightly improved model that has a time bomb built in it to go off when the next model comes out.<p>So basically Amazon needs to place their customers in a &#x27;release preference&#x27; category. With names like, &#x27;bleeding-edge&#x27;,&#x27;beta&#x27;,&#x27;stable&#x27;,&#x27;2 generations back&#x27;, or &#x27;annually/biannually&#x27;. This could make manufactures more responsible and get the latest designs out of secret labs and into consumers hands quicker.<p>Customers can choose which category they want to be included in for different product families. So for example, I might choose the &#x27;bleeding-edge&#x27; release cycle for my phone, but prefer a biannual subscription for a refrigerator or car.<p>And unless someone has a brand preference, the best products can be automatically chosen based on reviews from amazon and social networks and blogs and benchmarks on hardware/battery life/speed/etc<p>Discounts will be given for recycling your previous models, and as our 3d printing becomes better and closer to home, eventually we might just get &#x27;ink&#x27; credits to print out phones, computers, cars, furniture, TV&#x27;s etc.<p>On a side note, this kind of system would be the system of all systems and it would be hard for competitors to start (without the data owned by Amazon). So I don&#x27;t think &#x27;Amazon&#x27; should get to boast and claim this system as their own and keep the profits. I would like to see this type of system organized at the national level at first (until we fully embrace globalization) and we could vote on an open source &#x27;shopping and distribution&#x27; system whose profits go back directly to the people in the countries they operate. Then people could join and accept a national system to be proud of, one whose contributors, ideas,transactions,money,etc are all open and viewable by anyone to encourage accountability.",1390016387

PHP is a fucking mess, and non OO strings is a hangover vomit from C.<p>That being said, when there is a problem, there actually is a solution.  PCRE actually works.  Javascript, for instance, has no collation support at all as far as I can tell.<p>Personally, most of the problems with UTF-8 are mixed content issues.<p>The best fix is not the Python route, but rather just deprecating a bunch of stuff such as utf8_encode/decode.  Throw a warning when any database connection is not utf8.  Throw a warning when the OS is not setup to return UTF-8.  It is more important that people run php in a end-to-end utf-8 environment, than changing the internals.   Once people have a good environment, they will stop talking about strlen/strpos which are really not much of a problem.  Maybe they should be renamed bytelen/bytepos, but php has too many of that type of problem to count.<p>99% of the UTF-8 problems don&#x27;t exist if everything is UTF-8.  Counting unicode code points vs bytes is not the real problem.  The real problem is bullshit like &#x27;SET NAMES utf8&#x27; / setlocale(&#x27;LC_ALL&#x27;,&#x27;en_US.utf-8&#x27;)<p>BTW, what language do you think gets this stuff right?

Any site owners complaining about ad-blockers is missing the opportunity to detect ad-blocking and try to sell that person an ad-free version of their service. Ideally this service would be a pay per view model, where I pay a fixed amount (like 5 cents to 10 cents per article read) or where I pay a fixed subscription fee (like $1 to $2 a month for unlimited articles).<p>I did the math a while back with NY Times online advertising revenue and I remember the value gained from non-paying users to be around 70 cents per month per user. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I would happily pay 70 cents or even a full dollar or two for access to the NY Times ad free. Unfortunately, when a site does introduce an ad-free paid version they try to extract like 5x or more of the revenue they gain from advertising. I don&#x27;t know about others, but when I encounter that type of gouging, I just look elsewhere for my news.<p>So Mssrs. Publisher, please offer a reasonable paid ad-free alternative or quit your bitching. Every ad you serve is an annoying distraction that distracts me, irritates me and slows down my browsing experience both in terms of bytes download and lines of javascript executed.<p>I am completely within my right to block all outgoing requests to any host I deem negative to my web browsing experience via my /etc/hosts/ file. If you happen to serve ads from those sites and I can&#x27;t view them because I block them, that isn&#x27;t my problem it is yours. Want me to pay, give me the ability to do so and be fair with your prices.<p>So long as you don&#x27;t offer a paid service that I can buy and you support yourself via ads, you are not really considering me to be your customer, but your product. You are not in a position to complain when your product doesn&#x27;t consent to being sold.",1390014675

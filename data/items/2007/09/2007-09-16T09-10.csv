If he thought the valuation was too low, why didn't he say that instead of insulting people and pissing them off.",1189934991

55223,comment,54834,55107,0,0,uuilly,,,"Mr. Mugabe nationalized all farms in Zimbabwe.  There were many British Empire leftovers (white guys) running farms quite successfully.  Zimbabwe was actually one of the rare African hopes pre Mugabe.  Many said it would be the ""bread basket"" of Africa the way Ukraine is to Europe and Kansas is to the US.  Mugabe siezed all ""white owned"" land and had native Zimbabweans run the farms.  Predictably this all went to shit and their inflation rate now hovers between 6,000% and 10,000%.  No exageration.  When nobody could run the farms he actually buldozed tenemants and told the inhabitants to go work on the farms.  Very little edible food has materialized.<p>The way this relates to Ayn Rand is that in all her stories the captains of industry are pervceived as evil profit mongers by the masses.  The masses evantually rise up and take back what's ""theirs"" and the entire economy grinds to a halt.  This is what Rand witnessed in the Russian Revolution and this is exactly what is happening in Zimbabwe today.",1189934797

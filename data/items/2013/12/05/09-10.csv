There would have been a shorter first interview where both sides could ask questions.<p>At that point I&#x27;d hope that the candidate would know whether they were interested enough. I&#x27;m not saying they should be certain but it should be more than just an idle &quot;what&#x27;s this?&quot; situation.<p>If that wasn&#x27;t the case then the right thing to do would probably be to talk a little more about what the candidate was looking for, what concerns they had and whether we could address them and what (other than money) might convince them that an extended interview was a good use of their time. If they couldn&#x27;t be convinced then we could either talk about a shorter interview (either instead of or ahead of a longer one) or we&#x27;d have to accept that we&#x27;d not sold the opportunity to them and ask why we felt that was likely to change during a day together but couldn&#x27;t be addressed in any other way.<p>To be willing to hand over cash to someone to attend an interview I&#x27;d pretty much have to be convinced enough that I&#x27;d be willing to offer them a job without the interview.<p>As for desperation - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been or would ever be as desperate as you make out and this isn&#x27;t a &quot;random person off the street&quot;. If I was I&#x27;d hire a freelancer and still take my time over the long term hire.<p>As for the price, no you get to make an offer, and I get to politely decline and look elsewhere. Both my experience of recruitment (both recent and long term) and standard practice in the industry says that that&#x27;s working out just fine. It may be that there are specific local conditions where you are that mean otherwise but I can only comment on what I see in the UK.<p>Out of interest, your bio says that these days you&#x27;re largely management.

Learning out of a book is not as satisfying as grabbing an interpreter and some example code and just hacking away, but this is <i>precisely</i> a case where the by-the-book method can save you a lot of time and frustration later on.<p>Another example of a problem tutorials solve is not knowing what &#x27;tasteful&#x27; means in a given language.

6853503,comment,6852961,6853198,5,0,exDM69,,,"> Sure, they are some edge cases where it might make sense, but even then i would analyze requirements very carefully. I have quite a bit of experience with Unity3D and besides being really simple to use you can basically extend it with any C#/C++ library that you see fit.<p>Sure, Unity3d is very flexible and has given us some outstanding games. Like Kerbal Space Program, for example. KSP has quite a bit of modifications to make Unity3d work for them, they have had to do some black magic to make Unity3d work in space scale scenes on both, the physics and graphics departments.<p>When looking at dev talks given by the KSP team, it begs the question whether or not they would have been better off not using Unity at all and doing a specialized engine from scratch. There&#x27;s no real answer to this question and Unity probably made their time to market shorter so they could actually ship and sell the game to keep the development alive. And then they went on later to rewrite a lot of the stuff they did early on.<p>But from a purely software engineering standpoint, they might have been better off not using an off the shelf 3d engine, because there are no space scale 3d engines available.<p>Again, for most people it makes sense to pick up an engine and go with it but there are use cases where it might pay off to invest the time and effort to build your own tech from scratch.",1386237319

After you&#x27;ve submitted, you now have to wait for a long time (between 20 and 100 minutes) for the automatic grader to tell you whether your guess about what exactly you had to implement was right or wrong.<p>It&#x27;s still an interesting course, and it&#x27;s worth just for the sake of getting your hands into some Scala code, but there&#x27;s that caveat.",1386236823

6853465,comment,6852961,6853218,9,0,exDM69,,,"> Many studios use game engines that either abstract away the graphics API or at least greatly simplify it.<p>Not only do they abstract away API details, perhaps even provide an api independence layer but they actually make the 3d magic hapen. OpenGL/D3D have no notion of &quot;3d&quot;, there are no models, cameras, scenes, etc.<p>> OpenGL ES 2+ is more like DX10 and less like Open GL.<p>Not really. OpenGL ES is still like OpenGL. It&#x27;s a subset of full OpenGL and does not fix the inherent design issues with the API.<p>Feature-wise OpenGL ES 2 is like DX9 which is like OpenGL 2.1 sans the legacy crap. OpenGL 3 is comparable to D3D10 and OpenGL 4 to D3D11. OpenGL 2.x was the &quot;big change&quot; from the old fixed function pipeline to a programmable shader based pipeline, but nothing was removed or deprecated in order to provide an incremental porting path. OpenGL 3 actually deprecates some of the old features but does not change the API, only removes the old parts.<p>But the API is still a horrible mess with a global state and weird side effects, even if a lot of stuff was removed. For the programmer, D3D is a lot nicer than OpenGL in many ways and that is unfortunately not going to change for the foreseeable future.<p>OpenGL gets the job done but it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to use.",1386236537

You can only attribute some of that to marketing. I also do not think it&#x27;s a coincidence that all languages developed at Google, a company that knows a thing or two about large scale development, follow the Java philosophy.<p>I am not a PL researcher and not particularly interested in PL research aside from learning a thing or two about the potential of programming languages, but I am very much interested in moving the software development industry forward. Some of the things PL researchers focus on I find to be genuine problems with software development – like taming concurrency, which Haskell does a good job at though perhaps at an unacceptable cost to the industry, and Clojure and Erlang do an excellent job with despite their lack of PL researchers – while other areas, like developer productivity, I find to be the wrong problems to focus on.<p>Let me explain the last point because I think it&#x27;s important. We have some good languages (Ruby, Python) that are excellent for productivity, and are extensively used in some domains. Where those languages fail - concurrency, large-scale engineering - productivity is less of an issue.<p>But then I found Clojure (and, mind you, I personally prefer static typing and think it&#x27;s generally better for engineering, though I recognize this is just a means to an end), and saw a language that is probably as &quot;productive&quot; as Ruby, yet actually tackles the big issues (like making sure some careless team member does not introduce a very hard to find race condition).<p>I think Scala takes powerful though complex features and channels them – unlike, say, Haskell – into all the wrong places (productivity), and at the same time makes it impossible for a mere mortal to understand how a basic collection is written. You can argue details all you want with me, and say that you <i>could</i> do this and <i>could</i> do that, but a language that makes collections the domain of experts without at least fixing the <i>real</i> hard issues, is just plain misguided.",1386235787

So in that respect iOS needs a whole OS update to update things like Maps (not the data obviously, but the source of the app).<p>The issue there is that for someone living in a country where data is expensive, a 10MB download is better than an ~800MB one every time there&#x27;s some bugfixes/app updates.

Seems like their original plan of testing for genetic risk factors for a large number of diseases will require lengthy approvals for each and perhaps require conditions such as counseling that are not compatable with a kit.<p>My original comment was more a snark about the free pass the FDA gives to the supplement industry. This is a much less settled area so it is unclear if some fudge like I suggest could work either with the FDA or in the market.<p>Perhaps they will even seek legislative of legal relief like the supplements industry.",1386234467

Morning is the best time frame to be creative and productive for me (and for many people actually).<p>- Always keeping my stuff ready. This means clean email folders, clean notes, clean desk etc.<p>- Watching the food what I eat (I am not on a diet, but I do not eat pizza and chinese food every day e.g), the drinks also (tea instead of coffee), and keeping attention to breaks while I am working<p>I also pay attention to avoid disctractions while I am coding. Every morning when I sit down in front of my monitors I read my RSS feed/twitter/personal mails first. This is good to start my brain at the morning and also keeps me away from checking these at the rest of the day. A psychologist told me once at a training that your mornings should start with something they call &#x27;warm-up&#x27;. This is mine. Some people do not need it as they can warm up while they are travelling to their office or just after they get up and yoga for example.<p>Ah, and one mor thing for the sleep part. I - personally - don&#x27;t like when I need to fall asleep during watching a film or a part of a TV-series. It is also not the best when I just turn off the computer and jump into the bed. I always go to bed with a book in my hand. This relaxes me and when I feel I can sleep right now, I just turn off the lights (or my ipad). A few minutes of meditation is also very helpful for a good sleep.<p>Hope I could help!",1386234128

If you buy a house, you are relying on the government to uphold your property rights, otherwise anyone could come in and take it over. Let&#x27;s say you buy a house in SF, hoping for a steady income from rent. Let&#x27;s say people finally manage to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, and the tech industry moves to Utah. You&#x27;re going to lose a lot of money, and the government is under no obligation to make you whole.<p>I cannot live in a society where profits get concentrated when things go well and losses get spread around when things don&#x27;t, because that is not a sustainable society.",1443247018

What will be visible is individual ratings on people. In fact I think HR can then use it to train their people better and improve the whole experience, which will be good for the world. Think of it as the Uber rating - the driver won&#x27;t ever know you rated her a 4 star but she gets the aggregate of all passenger ratings. This way if she is getting close to 4.6/5 (threshold) she can do something about it, which changes her passengers&#x27; experience. That&#x27;s what this could do for job interviews - get people to behave better during interviews at least, because job seekers can now find out how others feel about the specific individuals they&#x27;re meeting during the interview process.",1443246077

10282220,comment,10282060,10282107,0,0,applygo,,,"Excellent points, thank you. I should clarify- the goal is to rate individuals, not companies. Often times, our perception of an entire org is based on our interaction with one person who works there. People quit bosses, not companies, so for your #2 point - this would be the rating to start with, which could ultimately expand to include confidential ratings on co-workers, bosses etc, thereby painting a more holistic view of the org. For your point #1 and #3, the service would tap into the wisdom of the crowd, so even a few biased ratings should get absorbed in the aggregate and shouldn&#x27;t statistically alter the true rating on an individual interviewer.<p>I&#x27;m in corporate HR and don&#x27;t think there is a market of HR buyers, since existing HR systems can easily incorporate a survey instrument. My goal is to get individual ratings by people of each other so job seekers can make a more informed decision. For example, Amazon has been in the news. My take is that it&#x27;s not the right place for everyone and even in the org there are different managers - good and bad. What would matter to me and you, I assume, is the individuals we are going to report to and work with. And today no service solves for this as far as I know.",1443245660

Unfortunately, people who are inconsiderate jerks are going to be lousy neighbors regardless of how they came to occupy the premises.  Laying blame for a tenant&#x27;s inconsiderate behavior at the feet of a particular broker is absurd; you may as well ban truckers from entering your city because they might deliver lead-based paint.  If airbnb went away, someone else would fill the niche; there&#x27;s obviously plenty of demand for short-term rental broking.  And you&#x27;re always going to have to deal with bad neighbors -- often of the much more permanent variety.  It would be a lot more constructive to think about the behavior you want to prohibit than tertiary factors like who arranged for a lease or how many days it was for.  The whole point of inconsiderate jerks -- and if you&#x27;d ever had one for a neighbor you would know this -- is that they don&#x27;t care what you think!  They&#x27;re not thinking &quot;gee, I&#x27;d better not be such an asshole, because I&#x27;m going to be living next to this guy for years!&quot;.  They&#x27;re thinking &quot;I like cranking my death metal to 11 at 3am and there&#x27;s no law against it so they can suck it.&quot;  That is, if they&#x27;re even aware of your existence at all.  Because that&#x27;s the kind of people they are.  What&#x27;s the worst you&#x27;re going to do, not lend them your lawnmower?<p>Seriously, I don&#x27;t care if airbnb succeeds or fails.  They don&#x27;t pay me, I don&#x27;t own their stock, and I don&#x27;t pretend that they&#x27;re making the world a better place or any of that tripe.  They&#x27;re just one more private corporation that wants to make a buck, and they seem to have found a much better way to serve a particular market than the dozens of other substantially indistinguishable competitors.  Good for them.  If it turns out that the only people who lease short-term rentals are inconsiderate jerks, then airbnb won&#x27;t be doing much business once those inconsiderate jerks are sitting in jails.  The anti-airbnb crowd seems to be shooting the messenger, while the pro-airbnb crowd seems to be elevating a glorified classified-ad publisher to sainthood for doing nothing more interesting than connecting willing buyers and sellers.  Everyone needs to get over it and focus instead on what matters.  This company just isn&#x27;t interesting enough to justify having a strong opinion about it.",1443244859

It is very balanced and discusses the relative pros and cons of typed and untyped proofs for formal verification<p>I&#x27;m not interested in Â«balanceÂ», because this isn&#x27;t a political debate, and my formal system choices don&#x27;t affect anyone but me. What I do care about is <i>convenience</i>: not having to translate between formal systems, ruling out as many unwanted behaviors making as little effort as possible.<p>And the arguments in the paper in favor of the Â«flexibilityÂ» of untyped systems are really arguments for sloppiness. To see why a more constructive approach is better, using an example from the article, instead of saying `i - j >= 0`, I would just say `exists k. i = j + k`. This means that the witness that `i - j >= 0`, namely, their difference `k`, can be used throughout the rest of the proof without recomputing it over and over.<p>> (the closest they come to making a specific recommendation is exploring pluggable optional types).<p>I&#x27;ve never found optional types worth the trouble, precisely because they run into the same issues as CircleCI has experienced with core.typed: they greatly constrain typeless exploratory programming, and bring in few of the benefits of typeful exploratory programming.<p>> I do that in Java. Haskell only brings you marginally closer to the correctness of a sorting algorithm than Java does (if at all) anyway.<p>For something like a sorting algorithm, I&#x27;d just carry out the proof by hand.<p>> If I need more formal verification, I use a model checker (JPF in the past, now I&#x27;m about to switch to TLA+). (...) I&#x27;ve found that using a model-checker that works directly on the Java code (like JPF) is not an advantage in terms of total effort over one that uses a separate specification language, especially one that&#x27;s as (relatively) simple as TLA+/+Cal.<p>I&#x27;m not going to question your experience. But all of this still seems like a lot effort to me.<p>> That&#x27;s more myth than reality. HotSpot without any tuning whatsoever performs better than pretty much all managed languages.<p>I never compared HotSpot&#x27;s performance with any other managed runtime. Mostly because it never gets to the point where a performance comparison matters - I don&#x27;t care how fast a runtime system is if it&#x27;s too hard to write correct programs that run on it.<p>> Tuning is required if you need to really come close to C-speeds, and in those cases it still requires far less work than C. But that&#x27;s a whole other discussion.<p>I never said C. I&#x27;m not willing to give up the ability to define my own abstractions in a statically verifiable and enforceable manner.<p>> True, but no one programs Turing machines. Whether term-rewriting is more convenient than mainstream imperative or imperative-functional (i.e. Clojure, ML, Erlang) requires empirical evidence which is so far sorely lacking.<p>Standard ML, with a subset of its reduction relation, is a perfectly usable term rewriting system. One just needs to be aware that, while types as collections of values are sets, types as collections of terms are just presets - not all terms are equal to themselves.<p>> So you&#x27;ll be happy to learn that you are wrong! TLA+ and friends have been used to verify lots and lots of concurrent and distributed algorithms (as well as hardware cache-coherence protocols) like Paxos, Raft,(fixed) Chord, and many, many others. See [2] and Lamport&#x27;s Checking a Multithreaded Algorithm with +CAL[3]<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a convincing demonstration of how those algorithms (or anything in the distributed computing literature) can handle concurrent data structures with interesting invariants.

Yes, helping someone effectively involves a person who knows the recipient of aid enough to understand their needs. But that doesn&#x27;t have to be you. You don&#x27;t have to go to Africa and distribute mosquito nets to save lives. You can work on <i>making</i> those nets, and that is helping. Or you can have a well-paying job and use surplus income to support people distributing those nets, people who know those they&#x27;re helping.<p>Also, a lot of low-hanging-fruits of world-fixing exist on social or global level, not on the level of individuals. I don&#x27;t need to know of or care about any sick person in particular to help fight malaria effectively - in fact, getting emotional is often counterproductive. What matters are aggregate effects. Number of people who would die but are not going to because of the aid is what matters.

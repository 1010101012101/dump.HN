Once you grok the way the syntax works, the rest is all learning library functions and new methods for things (often idioms); that happens over a long period of time no matter what.<p>Once I learned to program my first language, though, I could pretty reliably reach that point not long after it, unless I'm moving into a language of a completely unfamiliar paradigm (e.g. Java to Scheme).",1278640744

1499433,comment,1499019,1499315,0,0,Goosey,,,"This blind date idea is really what interests me. I think profiles create two issues beyond the ones you already pointed out. I am pulling these examples from my experience on OkCupid.<p>1 - People don't give fully honest answers to personality questions. Instead it seems people craft a personality they think will either get them the most results or get the the specific results they are looking for. So not only the profile, but also the questions become gamed due to the 'aggressive filtering' people do.<p>2 - People spend obsessive amounts of time crafting their profile, which actually gets read, and very little time answering personality questions, which don't. Assuming the personality question formula is more reliable for matching than making decisions based on someone's profile writing skills, this reverses the emphasis.<p>I think a basic system like OkCupid's could work for matching. I like the way you both give your answer and you give the answer you want your mate to have. It's intuitive and allows for complex dynamics like a submissive person seeking a dominant person. But the profile viewing/filtering gets in the way of the legitimacy. If it was a blind-date popcorn machine I think it would work a lot better (and be a lot more fun!)",1278640229

1499429,comment,1497446,1499257,0,0,ebroder,,,"Yeah, that definitely can be a weakness of RouteFS's style.<p>My target application was things like automounters, or the low-latency database querying sort of thing I mention in the actual blog post. Since I wanted to be able to have the filesystem structure change as it was accessed, I decided to make any sort of caching entirely an application-layer problem, not a RouteFS-layer problem.<p>I think it would be possible to extend RouteFS to handle this sort of case more gracefully. One option in particular might be to take advantage of python-fuse's stateful I/O feature (which lets you associate a Python object with open file descriptors in your filesystem [1]) so that reads from the same file don't result in the same lookup over and over again, although this certainly doesn't help for directories.<p>But in any case, I'd certainly love to see ideas for extending RouteFS to make it easier to make it more performant.

If the syntax you want is along the lines of<p><pre><code>  keyword identifier { body }\n  keyword identifier\n</code></pre>\nit's just a matter of matching tokens, counting brackets and then replacing forms.<p>With that being said, the examples sounds like making busy-work for yourself. The ""module"" would still suffer from monkeypatching-related collisions (e.g. think document.getElementsByClassName in old versions of Prototype.js).<p>Also, javascript has both statements and expressions, so hypothetical macro-enhanced code like this<p><pre><code>  var a = module A {}\n</code></pre>\nwould break depending on what ""module"" expands to.",1278640170
1499427,comment,1498437,1499208,0,0,waivej,,,"I priced out some servers and cloud providers.  It appears that the ""cloud"" servers are about 30% more expensive.  Though the gap widens when you start building bigger machines (32G RAM, latest processors, etc.)  EDIT: I'm looking at 2-16G machines.<p>On the other hand, in my case the extra capacity would sit idle for a while.  (I replace servers every 3 years.)  Going with a cloud platform, I would have likely upgraded a few times and taken on less risk.<p>The cool thing about cloud hosting is that you can always switch to owning your own hardware if it will save you money.  It's much harder to go the other way.<p>Also, once you try to shore up risks and add things like drive snapshots, the costs get much closer.

Google didn't use LLVM, didn't follow the example of some more thorough and less facile concurrency models, didn't exercise the necessary discipline re: mutable data structures, and didn't appear to have been keeping up with any lang research that has gone on since the 90s.<p>Whereas<p>Rust is made by a known language implementor, the impetus of the project was not in fact Mozilla's motives (they're merely supporting it after the fact), and it targets LLVM with the bootstrapping OCaml->RS implementation.<p>So by all means, explain to me why the non-gcc implementation (6g, 8g) for Google Go not being LLVM somehow isn't classic NIH.<p>With Go, Google based the language design upon what they'd <i>like</i> (Python with coroutines for systems programming), rather than actual research, restraint, or even using the existing best of class tools for implementation.<p>Edit:<p>>Has Google's Go gained publicity apart from having a vibrant community on Google's mailing list?<p>It got some mentioned on various tech news streams, nothing mainstream or substantial. I've seen (very) occasional posts on YC News of little toy projects in Go, but again, nothing I'd really notice or care about.<p>I'd say Node.js has gotten a much faster start than Go, and don't give me any guff about JavaScript being older, it doesn't matter, server-side js hadn't been done properly before Ryan Dahl.",1278638741

That means I have to keep Wordpress updated. Easy, but takes time and effort to do a boring housekeeping task. There's no 100% control because you have a CMS controlling your site instead of writing your own HTML and CSS files. Then you have to pay for hosting and stress over things like storage and bandwidth, or pay enough money that you don't have to, and then stress over the money. On the other hand, you could run your own domain name with email and so forth (and then worry about storing all the spam you ever receive on the server and the fact that your hosting provider has terrible anti-spam systems).<p>Or you could just point your domain to point at a Posterous and get Google Apps for your domain, spend 10 minutes playing with DNS settings and maybe an hour waiting for the DNS to propagate, and have a blog at your domain, the best email client in the world, and no stress.<p>If I needed more control, I'd write my own CMS and do the same thing except with Heroku instead of Posterous, because that's more fun than hosting my own installation of someone else's CMS. If I needed even more control I might consider a VPS and my own CMS. But hosting your own wordpress doesn't fit anywhere useful in terms of fun, control, or convenience.",1278638644

Journalists were quick to mock the poor ""broke"" guy that had $200k a month expenses, failing to note that legal fees constituted the majority.<p>That's utterly despicable - Grellas, can you help us put together a plan to disbar and exile everyone involved in the divorce racket or something? Talk about a destruction of wealth, energy, time, and life - it's embarrassing that we let this happen to people in the United States.<p>Our family/divorce courts and the associated personnel are destructive, vindictive, and capricious.

7202362,comment,7201262,7202176,8,0,tmzt,,,"I&#x27;ve reread my comment and am trying to see where I was critical of Android.<p>AOSP is open source, and it has parity with commercial distributions of Android in a number of areas.<p>I have been working with Android and Linux on Qualcomm MSM-based devices for a few years, navigating their portal at codeaurora.org, tearing into Android kernel commits and following the upstreaming process. The changes that Android makes to Linux are minor, and most of the them have been merged into the upstream kernel in some form.<p>The Linux framebuffer started out as a device wrapping the memory-mapped display memory of the Amiga and similar RISC devices, then it was ported to the Netwinder, which was an early embedded ARM computer in a screen. It has a minimal set of operations for accelerated graphics, it can do fast fills or clear the screen for instance. It does not support 3D graphics, it does not support most of the 2D primitives that X and the Android rendering libraries (such as surfaceflinger) require. Android had an extended protocol for using some of the features to enhance fast blits of of data from an offscreen buffer to the main display buffer. This was implemented using IOCTLs on top of the framebuffer, and by reusing some of the features in a different way.<p>This is sufficient to get you a basic Android launch screen, you won&#x27;t get the 3D launcher screen, you won&#x27;t get the enhanced gallery plugin, you won&#x27;t get fast Google Maps/Earth rendering, and you won&#x27;t be able to play 3D games. For that you need a 3D graphics driver. Most of these drivers are tightly controlled by the company that makes the chip, are closed source, and are not readily reverse engineered. Some projects have made progress, but it&#x27;s been a slow process. LIMA is an implementation of the ARM Mali driver for instance. Recently, Nvidia submitted a patch to Nouveau for their Tegra device. This breaks with years of not cooporating with development of 3D drivers for their devices on Linux, and has the potential for a bright future of AOSP 3D graphics support on Tegra devices.",1391889242

If MSFT went with their own Android store developers would just need minor changes to their Play Store version to gain yet another entry point. If it doesn&#x27;t work out no big deal.<p>Problem is just going Android without great  differentiation is almost a guaranteed failure for Microsoft. And at this stage in the game coming up with great differentiation is going to be very hard. But if they do something like put out great Nokia handset with great camera, guaranteed OS updates, a tiles based launcher an thriving alternate app store, more focus on privacy of the user and great Microsoft services and apps - that could work well. I am not sure about the practicaility of all that and if it will mean significantly more revenue for Microsoft.

7202315,comment,7201871,7201871,8,0,slashdotaccount,,,"REST is an architectural style. It is a formalisation of Fielding&#x27;s observation how the Web works.<p>A RESTful interface follows those principles and must employ hyperlinks (links in HTML, XLink in XML, _links property in HAL+JSON) and/or hypermedia controls (forms, XForms) and standard HTTP methods to assert state on resources. Resources are adressed by URIs.<p>An interface description concentrates on describing the semantics of media types of the resources (unless you were clever and picked an appropriate one that already exists) and link relations (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, &quot;area&quot; element with &quot;rel&quot; attribute in HTML; link objects in HAL+JSON; RFC 5988 Link headers for any media type). Link relations are standardised by IANA, but you can make your own one and assign some semantics to it by coining a URI. When an interface describes particular URIs (what you typically get when you google for REST interface examples), it&#x27;s doing it wrong. An interface implementation allows a user agent to discover resources through hyperlinks and what you can do with them through an OPTIONS request. You can recognise a REST n00b by their lack of talking about link relations, which is so far everyone else&#x27;s answers. I must consider colund&#x27;s and dclara&#x27;s answers as wrong/unhelpful because their explanation is so limited and unprecise.<p><a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a>\n<a href=""http://isitrestful.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isitrestful.com/</a>",1391888687

It also doesn&#x27;t mention how far along the road Samsung was to having the ability to ship Android without Google Mobile Services, until Samsung and Google made a peace treaty that involved sending Motorola off to live with Lenovo.<p>Yes, if you fork Android, you lose Google&#x27;s ecosystem. It&#x27;s not impossible to duplicate, though -- Amazon&#x27;s done it, Samsung just about did it. And Microsoft already owns all the things it&#x27;d need to do it -- that&#x27;s how Windows Phone has an ecosystem. Losing Google&#x27;s ecosystem isn&#x27;t the downside of forking Android, it&#x27;s the entire point.<p>Once you&#x27;ve done it, though, you need to convince people to use your fork instead of Google&#x27;s. Microsoft&#x27;s success at prying people towards Windows Phone and away from Android can basically boil down to:<p>1) The ability to run on lower-powered and thus cheaper hardware and still provide a polished experience, and\n2) Nokia&#x27;s build quality.<p>Switching OS cores to AOSP instead of the current Windows Phone OS wouldn&#x27;t entirely solve Microsoft&#x27;s app problem (look at the Amazon app store), and it would piss away the only competitive advantage their platform (as opposed to their OEM partner) has against Google&#x27;s Android experience. Microsoft isn&#x27;t Amazon -- they aren&#x27;t a cloud company looking for an OS to give to consumers, they already have an OS.

The nuclear industry changed and improved somewhat, but the deep understanding of what went wrong was lost on the public in general and the real lessons that we could have learned as a society were, too.  The financial mess we are experiencing right now isn’t all that different from Three Mile Island.  If we’d taken better to heart the true lessons of TMI we might not be in our present jam.</i><p><i>Looking back at the accident with the benefit of knowing what it took to clean it up and what the workers found when they were finally able to send robots inside the containment, the TMI accident was very bad indeed.  There were pressure spikes during the accident that would have cracked an average containment vessel, releasing radioactive gases into the atmosphere.  Fortunately the Unit 2 containment wasn’t average.  TMI-2 was built on the final approach path to Harrisburg International Airport, a former U.S. Air Force base, and was therefore beefed-up specifically to withstand the impact of a B-52 hitting the structure at 200 knots.  A normal containment would have been breached.</i><p><i>TMI wasn’t caused by a computer failure but the accident was made vastly worse by an error of computer design.  Specifically, TMI-2 had a terrible user interface.</i><p><i>What happened at Unit 2 was a little more complex.  A cascading series of events caused the computer to notice SEVEN HUNDRED things wrong in the first few minutes of the accident.  The ONE audible alarm started ringing and stayed ringing continuously until someone turned it off as useless.  The ONE visual alarm was activated and blinked for days, indicating nothing useful at all.  The line printer queue quickly contained 700 error reports followed by several thousand error report updates and corrections.  The printer queue was almost instantly hours behind, so the operators knew they had a problem (700 problems actually, though they couldn’t know that) but had no idea what the problem was.</i><p><i>So they guessed.</i><p><i>Not good.</i><p><a href=""http://www.cringely.com/2009/03/31/three-mile-island-memories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cringely.com/2009/03/31/three-mile-island-memorie...</a>",1391888177

7202203,comment,7201253,7201605,15,0,anigbrowl,,,"The thing is, this basically suffers the same problems. It&#x27;s not so much technical shortcomings (although the sound desperately needs work...but I&#x27;m a sound guy so I would say that). It&#x27;s just that special effects, ultra-violence, money shots, and showdowns are not the backbone of a movie. Now, the eye-candy stuff is the most expensive in production terms on a real movie, and trailers are always full of eye candy because a) you want to catch people&#x27;s attention and b) you need to sketch the story very quickly and pictures are the most efficient way of doing that. But the backbone of the story is the relationship between the characters that you care about, and you can&#x27;t ever get to know characters enough to care about them if they&#x27;re just walking around turned up to 11 all the time.<p>Look at <i>South Park</i> - visually speaking it looks terrible, the character design and animation is about as basic as it can possibly get. But it&#x27;s involving because the characters act out their personalities in a consistent enough way that the audience can identify with them by mentally modeling their behavior. <i>South Park</i> sin&#x27;t to everyone&#x27;s taste of course, but you can think of lots of other examples, I just picked this one to point out that the visuals are the least important element. The surprise in a storytelling reveal comes from discovering that a character is not who you thought she was, or or from having a resolution between two conflicting elements within the same character.<p>The reason that tragedies are tragic is because there are many things you like about the lead and it&#x27;s painful to see them lost because of the lead&#x27;s poor moral choices and eventual downfall. Likewise the enjoyment in seeing a hero&#x27;s triumph is in watching them transcend their weaknesses. <i>Rocky</i> wouldn&#x27;t be a success if it was just 90 minutes of Sylvester Stallone boxing to victory. the film seems like it&#x27;s about boxing, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s about a dead-end guy who wants love and self-respect. Only his girlfriend knows what his real goal is, because she&#x27;s the only person he&#x27;s able to be completely honest with.<p>The problem with <i>Deathknights in Lov</i>e is that nobody in this story seems to have any life outside of Being Epic, whether they&#x27;re Casting Epic Spells, Fighting Epic Battles, or Making Epic Whoopie. I can&#x27;t relate to them because they&#x27;re not real people, they&#x27;re WoW avatars. I think Valve&#x27;s <i>Team Fortress</i> & source toolkit are a far more fruitful tool for Machinima because the characters are more cartoonish and have clearly delineated strengths and weaknesses, so while none of the related Machinima is Shakespeare there is plenty of scope for comedy. The relative lack of realism makes it easier to focus on the dramatic elements rather than the purely visual ones (camera moves, impressive entrances and poses, special effects etc.). I think this was also a key aspect of <i>Red v. Blue</i>&#x27;s success - it&#x27;s much easier to transcend production quality constraints with humor.<p>I work on a lot of low-budget films, many of which are dreadful - and what makes them bad is not the lack of production value (sets costumes, cinematography, FX etc. etc.) but the lack of life in the characters, who are usually so bad that the actors and crew hold the fictional characters in complete contempt; at least if the characters are ridiculous the film has a chance to be tongue-in-cheek funny, but often they&#x27;re just awful. This is the opposite of the film school problem where the characters tend to be richly textured wonderful people (because the writers and directors want everyone to know how interesting and pleasant they are), but there&#x27;s not much budget or time for production value so you get a lot of films where Nothing Happens and the nice people who live in the world of the film are never put under sufficient stress to make for an interesting story.<p>With Machinima, the temptation is to use the computer for all that stuff that would be impossibly expensive to do otherwise. And I don&#x27;t blame anyone for wanting to do something that looks epic, because while comedy is easier to stage it&#x27;s harder to write, and if you want to be dramatic then awkward/comic stuff lets the air out of the balloon and can actually be depressing. But the strength of epic stories comes from the character development and that ultimately means characters have to overcome their natural tendencies in pursuit of something else. I would be much more interested in (and forgiving of) the <i>Deathknight</i> story if started out with a character that was actually fearful and whose sole interest was in escape, survival, and relief from being someone else&#x27;s target all the time. That&#x27;s a situation where good and evil start to actually matter, and courage has to be found rather than just being a character trait for the people on screen to measure each others&#x27; bad-assery. <i>Apocalypto</i> is a good film exploration of this theme, not least because it has so little dialog and all the action is motivated by the lead characters need to escape.<p>Alternatively, I&#x27;d be intersted in a story where I find out why the villian is so bent on exterminating everyone else. It&#x27;s not Because He&#x27;s Evil; nobody goes through life doubling down on the belief that they&#x27;re a bad person, people do evil things because they believe they&#x27;re superior and that people who get in their way are obstacles to be overcome in the pursuit of some worth (by the villain&#x27;s standards) goal. A villain that just wants everyone dead doesn&#x27;t have anything much to struggle for; even if s/he&#x27;s a sadist, then there needs to be a struggle against boredom. If the villain completely succeeded in taking over the world and eliminating all opposition, what would s/he do then? Villains are either fleeing fears or pursuing goals just like heroes; when a plot revolves around Good vs Evil it&#x27;s usually a sign that the story is basically Zombies vs. Zombies. Even in such a situation, audiences still want o pick a side; so the <i>Alien vs. Predator</i> movies succeed as action movies because we can anthropomorphize the Predator character more easily than the Xenomorph. If it was, I dunno, <i>Aliens vx. Giant Spiders</i> or <i>Terminator vs. Predator</i> (or any plot where both sides are intent on the destruction of the other and have little or no instinct for self-preservation) then it isn&#x27;t that interesting to watch any more because questions of success or failure become so abstract as to be meaningless.<p>In short, I need a reason to care for characters other than their merely wearing metaphorical white hats or being the first people to appear on the screen before the Villains.",1391887456

The spacecraft has already been designed, built, and launched in the course of its original mission. These are typically the most expensive parts of any mission. For the price of a little on-board propellant needed to nudge a craft on a new trajectory and a modest amount of additional funding for mission operations and science, an existing spacecraft can sometimes be sent to another target of interest.\n...\nOn September 18, 2008, ICE, which had finally begun drifting closer to the Earth, was located and successfully reactivated. It was found that all but one of its 13 instruments were still functioning and enough propellant remained on board for a velocity change of 150 meters per second (320 miles per hour). There appeared to be enough life left in the old probe to perform more useful science. ICE should return to the Earth-Moon system again around August 10, 2014—over three decades after it left. NASA scientists, including a team lead by Robert Farquhar, are considering several options for the future of ICE, including redirecting it towards additional comet encounters in 2017 or 2018. Still other missions are possible for this robust, reused spacecraft before it once again drifts back into interplanetary space and subsequently returns to the vicinity of the Earth sometime in the 2040s.",1391886448

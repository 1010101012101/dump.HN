And fuzz the photos they send a bit more so it is legible enough to identify your car, but not to read the license plate itself. And remove superfluous data from the IP results, like time of entry.<p>As compared to the current system where you can immediately get a list of every car in the carpark, with its location, entry time, and photos where the license plates are discernable.<p>And they could institute per-IP throttling of requests (no more than 5 an hour or something) to stop someone brute-forcing number plate combinations to get a ""map"" of the centre.<p>Finally they could have locked out the admin interface so that random members of the public couldn't do other things as well. ;)<p>But you're right in general - even implemented correctly, this feature has an interesting privacy implication - at any given time, anyone with a license plate number and a vague description of the vehicle can check if that car is parked at a Westfield, and where it is parked.",1315983511

He's trying too hard to argue something that's <i>obvious</i> - Windows 8 is coming out in a year or more, so placing it in the competitive landscape probably requires a fairly harsh assessment.  If you make a few modest projections about where the iPad and Android will be in a year (both in market/mindshare and in terms of product advancement), Windows 8 will probably be at a hard disadvantage in the consumer space.<p>There's a lot to discuss/praise/criticize about Windows 8 so it's a shame he got into the discussion by rising to flamebait and flailing at something resembling a criticism of MS's strategy.",1315983463

However, even if you have a tiny piece of software, like a game that you can reliably complete manually in 20 minutes, completely playing it through after every change is way too slow for ""live coding"". You should see your results instantly. Just like your test suite should run in seconds. If you have to wait minutes to compile, deploy and test your productivity will fall. A full integration/acceptance test suite can take longer, but it should be as automatic as possible and you can't use it for rapid feedback like this, but more for regression/acceptance testing.<p>Notch was able to take advantage of immediate feedback for the most part of his coding. The first hours spent on the rendering was tested by watching the world being rendered live. I've been doing the same developing a game in Clojure. When he got as far as the gameplay, he slowed down considerably, since he had to wander around in the game world to test each new feature. He for example made temporary shortcut passages, so he was able to test the boss monsters, without actually having to pass through the levels.<p>He is a person who can concentrate on delivering results and hack away at code for long stretches. This is the kind of code he presumably has done again and again for years. Who professional web developer can't hack together a small site as quickly? Where most people fail is attention span and drive! I know my unfinished projects speak of that :)<p>Most interesting part to me, of watching Notch code, was to see how he used his tools. And it was inspiring and motivating to see the progress. The actual code was very hackish but quality code is not important in a throw-away project anyway :)",1315980548

Firstly, thanks Troy for bringing this issue to our attention. Our intention was to create a free service for our customers so they never lose their car again! However, we have more work to do.   Our partner, Park Assist, who provide the camera technology to capture the number plate today advised there was an issue with the authentication of their data feed to the iPhone which resulted in number plate data being publicly assessable via the internet. This issue has been addressed immediately by Park Assist and the Find My Car functionality will not be available for approximately one week until the app has been modified to ensure that data cannot be publicly assessable online. Further, the Find my Car functionality on our app is similar to other location-based services and has been developed to provide a service to the average shopper, in an effort to make it easier to find their car. In terms of privacy, the application does not contravene the Privacy Act in so far as numbers plates are not personal information, and are therefore not subject to that act. Having said that, the application theoretically could be used for purposes other than its original intention, however it does not facilitate any activity that couldnt already happen otherwise. For example, a member of the general public may try to use the application to find a car that is not theirs. On the other hand, at the request of police, the application might also be used to assist in their enquiries into a given situation however, Westfield would not expect either of these situations to be typical.We appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention and we are now working on an update to resolve the technical issue.

They tend also to be the most passionate about developing. It's not an absolute rule, but I found a good indicator.<p>As for having a life, let me tell you I have a 6 months old who spent 1.5 months of his life in the hospital, a wife, I'm CTO and co-founder of startup for which I code about 60 hours a week. On top of that, I have time to help my my wife with her business (my previous company), I have fulfilled time with my family, take the weekends off and have time for personal hobbies and pet projects. I sleep enough and sleep well and I'm happy and balanced.<p>A lot of the most involved and active people in the tech community in Montreal that I know personally have startups, children and time for their family. I'll tell you they're the most awesome, bright, funny and balanced people I ever met.<p>One thing that makes it possible for me is a 10 minutes walk commute. The other biggest factor is having priorities straight on how I want to balance my life. Is it easy? No. Do I always have the energy and passion to go forward? Yes. Seeing my son smile when I wake him up each morning helps a lot.<p>You don't have to be young, without a family and responsibilities to have the passion and energy to be able to do things you care about for yourself outside your work.

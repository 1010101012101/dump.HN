Non-front office facing I.T is being pushed to cheaper locations - primarily to Scotland and Southampton in the UK and is not considered a Core Competency , its outsourcing in a different form , its called IN-Sourcing.<p>The primary reason for the cancellation of the contract was the sheer amount of beauracracy IBM imposed. Their modus-operandi was - pick up staff who were working in ""non-critical"" areas and make them report to IBM managers.  So now all-of a sudden if i need to get something from our DBA i can't walk upto him and ask him , i need to raise a request in a god-awful system which goes to his manager who would be sitting in a remote location in a different time-zone ""managing"" the work-load of the DBA who sits 5 feet away from me. In the majority of the cases for access to sysadmins and DBA's who were an integral part of your team before you now had to go through this route.<p>I will leave the readers to draw their own conclusions to this marvellous scheme.",1281607198

For example, as I understand it, Sam Walton designed Walmart the way he did because his wife was adamant about raising her kids in a small town and was unwilling to follow his career dreams to the big city. He lover her enough to accommodate that and still go after his dreams.  It made him ridiculously wealthy.  (IIRC, when he died, five of the relatives that split up his wealth were among the top ten wealthiest Americans.)<p>I also like knowing what inherent personality traits or other personal issues someone has which were problematic for them and they made it work by choosing a career that fit with something they couldn't change about themselves.  For example, my understanding is that Jim Carey was considered to be an obnoxious class clown in high school and then, when he became a millionaire for his sense of humor, suddenly his class mates remembered him as ""Yeah, he was always funny like that!""",1281606858

It comes pre-loaded with a branded browser, maps application, photo album app, marketplace etc. none of which are any better than the native Android versions (also present on the phone) and because they're burned into the phone's memory, I can't remove them myself to free up some of that valuable space.<p>I'm sure the carriers would argue that their branded apps somehow ""add value"", but why not provide an SD card with installable versions on it, and let the customer decide how they want to experience the handset they've bought.",1281604121

This definitely doesn't strike me as hacker-<i>centric</i> in that Googley/Facebookey way that PG describes. Apple undoubtedly employs many talented hackers, but they're not so much the center of its culture as they are its foundation. A brilliant and responsive UI with a stupidly simple implementation will be more highly prized than a work of coding genius that only marginally furthers user experience.<p>Of course, if you want to extend the idea of hacking so that one can speak of user experience hackers, then Apple would definitely qualify as having a ""hacker-centric culture"".",1281604111

Perhaps for personal reasons PG omits to mention the business trajectory and the personality of the leaders.This includes the element of luck that is far greater component of success that a culture, even the hacker culture. This doesn't mean that the culture is not important but you cant have an argument about ""what went wrong with Yahoo"" without ""what went right with Yahoo"" or Google, etc. In case of Yahoo a nothing HTML page was propelled to a media empire during the crazy dotcom boom, while Google stumbled as randomly onto the search goldmine. Both companies were created in the PhD classrooms of Stanford U, not in a garage like Apple.<p>Next both Google and Yahoo brought in professional executives or ""suits"" to run the firms, speak to Wall St. etc. Eric Schmidt is a professional CEO, not a hacker. He was at Sun, then he tried to revive Novell and then was tapped for Google.Yahoo is also run by a professional CEO now. How does that compare to the single minded life long vision of Steve Jobs? What role the leadership and their personalities plays in running the companies beyond the culture? Remember Apple was a ""has been"" company with plenty of suits and they even fired Steve Jobs at some point.<p>There is a fundamental flaw in PG's argument, he is trying to have a rational explanation about an irrational path to success of failure.",1281603604

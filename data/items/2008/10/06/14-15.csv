So the only real issue is scale.<p>Bear in he's talking about enterprise software (i.e. support contracts, custom software, consultants).

(Technically, the languages themselves are as old as PHP or older, but their popularity in the web problem space is new.)<p>Some of the advantages of being old are easy to appreciate, like the fact that PHP is so easy to deploy that most cheap shared hosts deploy it as a matter of course, and the fact that it runs really fast. Others are more subtle. There are enormous user communities centered around user-focused, PHP-based toolkits like Wordpress and Drupal. Ruby and Python just don't have these yet, but that may just be a question of time. The Drupal community is now huge, but it took nearly eight years to get to this point. There are a few Ruby and Python-based projects which aim to be the equivalent of Drupal (everybody wave to the Insoshi folks!), but they're only a year or two old.<p>Which is too bad, because Ruby is <i>so</i> much more satisfying than PHP.

If the problem is to quickly push out a dynamic page, then PHP is good, at least as good as ASP or JSP in their PHP-ish mode.<p>Its adoption rate also shows it's a good solution to the ""push dynamic pages out"" problem, but there are at least two angles to this problem: the point of view of the programmer and the point of view of the server manager. I suspect the adoption rate has a lot to do with the availability of ""US$ 2.99 hosting"" options, most of which offer PHP. So, it can be popular both because it's a really good option, because it's dirt cheap or a combination of both.<p>You emphasize the rapid results thing, which is good - if the larval programmer doesn't get some feedback, he or she won't stay interested long enough to learn. But there are other ways of giving feedback - a GUI, for instance. Or printing to the console. No web is required here except for the reason PHP is web-centric.<p>And then, there are the structural problems with PHP. No namespaces, too much magic in type conversions and so on. Believe-me: I have seen a generation of programmers lost because they were poisoned by Clipper and then by VB. They never really recovered. Maybe ther never will.",1223302342

It's the first thing to go, well before productivity enhancements.<p>Of course, this means that for entrepreneurs starting companies <i>now</i>, consumer may be the way to go.  It'll take a couple years to ramp up, and by then, the field has been thinned because investors only want to invest in enterprise startups.

The other languages also offer abstractions that are difficult or impossible to make use of in PHP.<p>But, that said, I agree with the point of your essay. It really doesn't matter that a hacker's first language is lingustically impoverished. The entire point of being a hacker is that you <i>go on to learn several more languages</i>. And I don't buy the argument that your first language indelibly warps your mind  -- that's an argument from the era of old-school microcomputer BASIC, the kind with line numbers, no function calls, and only global scope. <i>That</i> was a terrible language, far more impoverished than PHP ever was, yet I and everyone I know started with it, and we all grew out of it just fine.<p>The other point I'd make is that far too much attention is paid to the reasons why PHP sucks, when we should instead be trying to figure out why PHP even exists. Specifically, we should be trying to figure out why all the PHP programmers didn't learn Perl instead, and (more importantly) why Java didn't displace PHP despite its massive marketing advantages and its (supposedly) better design.",1223301994

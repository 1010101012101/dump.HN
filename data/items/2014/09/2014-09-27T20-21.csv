That is a proposition with non-zero cost, so it needs to be weight against the derived benefit.<p>And IMHO for move semantics, that benefit is pretty low.  The overwhelming number of allocation bugs with C++ code are treated very well by RAII already.  Move semantics tend to be best used in library code that implements some kind of dynamic runtime.  And let&#x27;s be honest: that&#x27;s stuff that (1) tends to be done by experts already and (2) has been done successfully and robustly for decades in C anyway.

Dimensionful quantities cannot be measured, only dimensionless ones can be measured: we can only measure pure numbers.<p>When we say we measure the speed of light, we are really measuring the ratio between that and some other arbitrary speed defined by our measurement device.

For me, as a mature student, I treat the laptop lid as something I can open before class, or during class to Google subjects related to what&#x27;s being presented, or see something in more detail and add it to a &quot;For Later&quot; list in Safari. I choose to sit up front so I&#x27;m not personally distracted by others watching movies, and I actually close the lid and/or look at the prof to make sure he knows that I&#x27;m paying attention. In many ways I feel like this is just missing etiquette training, students not taking things seriously because they&#x27;re still outgrowing their high school antics. Ultimately, the computer is a tool for learning, just as the classroom auditorium is. I wonder how this discussion would change if the learning was delivered online? Would there instead be directions on how to disable notification bars on your phone, set up auto-replies to texts and chats and recontextualizing computers as the learning tools they can be? Or without the auditorium would these issues go unnoticed?",1411851322

8378169,comment,8377289,8377289,1,0,ahomescu1,,,"I&#x27;m surprised to see that the increased use of electronics in lectures hasn&#x27;t started to make people doubt the merits of the lecture system itself. In my opinion, university has two main benefits: learning and socialization with like-minded people. Even before the occurrence of laptops and tablets, I always thought that lectures are a terribly inefficient way of achieving either of those goals. If I want to learn something, I go pick up a book and read it myself, at my own pace. On the socialization side, a 30-to-1 forced conversation that takes 3 hours (or 1 hour, depending on the length of the lecture) is silly. Besides, I&#x27;ve seen very few professors who come to class to engage their students in a conversation; most just come with a set of slides and do a 3-hour slide-assisted monologue. I have always found the latter boring.<p>I think universities need to get rid of lectures, and start to focus more on dynamic, spontaneous interactions between students and professors. For example, instead of having a 3-hours lecture every week, the professor could have 15 10-minute office hours sessions in his office.",1411850915

There were usually a couple students in a typical lecture using them and they got a lot of flack from their neighbors if they were typing too loudly.<p>In grad school, I recall sitting in on some lectures of a course I was TA&#x27;ing.  In just a few years it seemed that a technological revolution had occurred.  More students had laptops open than not.  It was like sitting in a field of frantically mating crickets. The subject being taught was classical mechanics (for non-physics majors), so there were plenty of equations and diagrams.  The students nearest to me seemed to have a variety of solutions.  Some had tablets that allowed them to draw directly in their notes.  Some had a pad of paper that they switched to.  Others seemed to be ignoring anything they couldn&#x27;t type.  Suboptimal, to say the least!<p>The really disturbing thing was how many laptops were not engaged in anything that remotely resembled note-taking.  People were writing emails, browsing, sending text messages, watching T.V. shows, you name it. There was one kid sitting in the front row, happily watching South Park with a giant pair of headphones on. She clearly didn&#x27;t care about the class, nor did she care about letting both the prof and everyone sitting behind her know about it.  Why did this kid even bother showing up?<p>I was just there so I&#x27;d know what was being covered, but I think I missed half of that class just gawking at how technology was being (mis)used.

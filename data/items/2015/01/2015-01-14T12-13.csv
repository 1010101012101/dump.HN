Big players are pouring more and more money into automated trading, and that trading relies on algorithms.  Often the algorithms involve some sort of machine learning, and therefore depend on the input data, which is vulnerable to manipulation.<p>For example, imagine a bot programmed by some 5-10 person team at a hedge fund. They find that running sentiment analysis on twitter and news comments can accurately predict whether a given security will rise or fall in response to a fed press release. The profits are good, so the team manager moves a couple million into the algorithm. One night after work, a team member tells his programmer friend about the algorithm, and mentions some of the most profitable stocks. This friend goes home and programs <i>another</i> bot to corrupt the sentiment analysis dataset, by posting fake comments with properly tuned sentiment. The hedge fund bot reacts as expected, and now the friend has the power to manipulate the bot. He has outsmarted the bot and can take advantage of the high volume trading.<p>That might be a bit of a contrived example, but corruption in machine learning data is a very real problem. People are just starting to study it.

Is there nothing all these lawyers can&#x27;t corrupt? Yeah the things they fucked up through sheer incompetence.
Anyway kids the lesson here will be HFT is bad for you because the spreads in the market you can trade are now tighter, so you have lower transaction costs putting more money in your pocket but Goldman&#x27;s lucrative market-making is lost to them. Bad for goldman&#x27;s is bad for you. Oh and bubble markets are caused by short-selling.
Investment fund reporting season, rash of stories about HFT and short selling and how evil they are - just please ignore those huge fees mutual funds charge for their underperformance. 1-2% of your wealth per year. 6 figures of your money, please look at short selling and HFT and not that because that&#x27;s not scary at all.",1421238947

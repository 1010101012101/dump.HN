Assuming this is true, that eventually dealers are going to go the way of the dodo. And if that is the case, wouldn&#x27;t if be best to bet on 6500 jobs that are likely to stick around in the future and keep bringing in revenue for the state, than let another state get that factory and one day you have neither the dealership jobs or the factory jobs in your state. Plus, it&#x27;s not like those dealership jobs are going to disappear overnight.",1395860399

SQL at this point is passed expiry.<p>The simple reason is we now have plenty of decent scripting languages to run as interactive prompts, all of which are far better at interfacing with the rest of the system than SQL is. Exposing a sane, direct, API in those languages gets you much more than SQL, along with having removed multiple layers of confusion, including string generation, escaping, reparsing, then is it doing what you want, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve been using LevelDB (via plyvel) a lot lately for data storage, and every time I end up having to use SQL (even indirectly via ORM) is painful by comparison because you can just feel the control being taken away from you, and somewhere you end up having to fire up the DB prompt for no good reason such as adding strange DB specific indexing flags to columns or even setting up authorization and DB creation, making it yet another thing to go wrong during deployment.<p>Protocol buffers stored in LevelDB prove so easy to use by comparison with something like SQLite or PgSQL just at an API level. The resulting code is simpler, cleaner, and much easier to reason about. If I need to move it to another format the code, again, is amazingly small.<p>As someone that cares deeply about my app&#x27;s data structure seeing the acceptance of a world beyond SQL is one of the best developments in my career, and experience means I simply don&#x27;t trust any SQL based abstraction to give you the controls to get it right.",1395860355

I tell everybody I know about it, and I&#x27;m soon to release some blog posts and speak at a Meetup showing off what it is good at and how to get started - I really just can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about these guys.<p>A high level overview from someone who has used it in production since 1.10 (about six months):<p>Pros:<p>* ReQL is a beautiful DSL that makes querying and using my data simpler than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.<p>* An amazing UI lets you quickly do the things you do the most (verify a query, cherry pick some results, add/drop tables, indexes, shards, etc).<p>* Unparalleled support. During almost any reasonable hour, a RethinkDB employee will quickly field any question you have on #rethinkdb (freenode), their User Group, or email.<p>* Quick releases. These guys ship major releases every 60 to 90 days. Each release offers huge features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. They do a great job of listening to what people want and implementing them fast.<p>Cons:<p>* Database is still technically &quot;beta&quot; - great for side projects and prototyping, but be mindful if you intend to use it in production.<p>* Works great on tables of a few GB, but performance really degrades on the next order of magnitude. It looks like there were major changes in 1.12 addressing this.<p>* Only three officially supported clients (JS, Python, Ruby). That&#x27;s a good start for their target market, but it is limiting for some.<p>RethinkDb is an archetype for startups - building what people want, shipping fast, always talking to customers, and clearly passionate about what they do. Even if you don&#x27;t use their product, we all can learn from these guys. I hope they do well.",1395860321

7475548,comment,7474868,7475453,2,0,zanny,,,"> There&#x27;s a reason why 0% inflation is not thought to be optimal.<p>Because money sitting in a box under your bed isn&#x27;t doing the economy any good. We saw a lot of the productive gains that lead to total GDP growth in the 80s because inflating fiat meant higher (predictable, not stagflation) money velocity.<p>Having inflation, and a dollar losing value, is good because it means you don&#x27;t want to just sit in the dollars, you spend them on things and keep moving them around the system. You instead invest your money, and optimally have stocks or business interests using your money to make you returns while keeping the money circulating.<p>I don&#x27;t think the problems with modern fiat are necessarily because you have inflating money - it is more that corrupt legal monopolies on counterfeiting will funnel new money into a select few, while the printing is hurting everyone else. It is more the unequal rigged distribution of new funds than anything.<p>Of course, bitcoin is a great replacement for bonds or gold, because it inevitably is going to deflate when it has market saturation, no more btc is minted, but wallets are lost so the monetary base shrinks. So you can reliability predict it getting more scarce over time, and if everyone else agrees it still has value it would get more valuable too.<p>And on the flipside you have something like Doge or Peercoin, the former with fixed monetary base expansion of a fixed number of coins (which means the total inflation drops each year and approaches 0% when you have enough Doge that adding 5 billion coins a year is a small fraction of the total monetary base. I guess eventually it would reach equilibrium, where your money lost from lost wallets or people forgetting passwords matches money generated each year.<p>I think Peercoin is interesting because the inflation scales with the monetary base, so 1% more of all active coins is meant to be printed each year, so you have a near constant 1% inflation.<p>I also think there is room for a cryptocurrency with predictive analysis of the monetary base - if the velocity is low relative to the number of coins, it means you aren&#x27;t inflating enough and people are sitting on funds. If the velocity is too high you are inflating too much and should cut back printing. It would be neat to see an algorithm to balance that, which is why in common economics something around 1% inflation in the long run is considered optimal.",1395860025

You&#x27;re also a really organized Java programmer, which makes it a lot easier for other people to build on what you made.<p>With that said, this Java implementation needs a lot of performance improvement. I made some trivial changes on it and benchmarked it at a significant speed boost, I&#x27;ll send you my revisions on GitHub so you can take a look. Also, as another commenter mentioned, this isn&#x27;t true A*, but good work nonetheless.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple performance improvement: Java&#x27;s ArrayList is just a wrapped array with two fields:<p><pre><code>  private transient Object[] elementData;\n  private int size;\n</code></pre>\nWhen you initialize it, it initializes elementData to a null array of size of 10. When you put the 11th thing into the list, it creates a new array of size 15 (in general, a 50% increase), and copies references from the old array. This means that in your search, a board with 11 or more open tiles will trigger a resize. This is easily prevented by initializing the list with<p><pre><code>  new ArrayList <Tile> (15)\n</code></pre>\nBam! One optional parameter, 9% runtime improvement.

It is theoretically even possible to reduce this time to milliseconds.

7475389,comment,7474868,7475171,2,0,exelius,,,"Since most users store their money in wallets with exchanges like Coinbase, how trivial would it be to write trading algorithms that minimize shifts in capital gains? E.g. Coinbase would try to balance capital losses and gains on a continuous basis, then come tax time they sell off an appropriate number of BTC to pay the tax bill on the net appreciation of their coins over that time.<p>I think this will accelerate the shift towards Bitcoin exchanges operating as banks under the law. If you, as a consumer, deposit $1000 with Coinbase, they could store this as $1000 USD if they were a bank. Then, upon you actually wanting to spend the Bitcoin, they perform the transaction to another bank. It all happens so fast that the price of BTC doesn&#x27;t change so the consumer pays no capital gains taxes.<p>Likewise, if you choose to maintain your BTC wallet yourself, TurboTax could write a module where you provide them your wallet address and they let you know your tax burden by comparing your transactions over the last year with the spot price of BTC when they were performed. It&#x27;s not obvious from looking at the blockchain, but if you have the blockchain plus the addresses of all the various wallets owned by a person, you could do it. Transactions within that set of wallets are non-taxable, transactions outside of it are. If you don&#x27;t provide all your wallet addresses, that&#x27;s effectively tax fraud and is no different than keeping a Swiss bank account. At the end of the day, the government has the power to throw you in jail if you don&#x27;t pay your taxes, and that gives them the power to regulate the economy.<p>This is all predicated on the assumption that Bitcoin will never serve as a true currency; which I think all signs are that it won&#x27;t because governments just aren&#x27;t willing to give up enough control over the economy to make it possible. But Bitcoin can still be useful as a method of transaction, which is why I think we&#x27;re seeing regulation pop up around it.",1395859008

Having a manager has already established a hierarchy of relationships that you deal with in your day to day work. Even if your manager tries to be an equal to you, they are in fact not your equal, they are your superior.<p>> Instead of asking yourself &quot;does this management know what it&#x27;s doing?&quot; ask yourself &quot;does this management make me better as a professional?&quot; If you can say &quot;yes&quot; to the second question, the answer to the first question doesn&#x27;t matter. The company can fail, but if you come out of it better than you came in, you still succeeded.<p>I don&#x27;t buy into this definition of success. Indeed, if you don&#x27;t have any confidence in what management is doing, it is really unlikely that said management is making you a better professional. In those scenarios you are already looking at management through a lens of mistrust (mistrust that may be totally justified). For someone like the submitter, if being a part of a specific kind of project is more important that money or resume building, they will have a hard time finding a place where they won&#x27;t be unhappy over time because they do not have a true ability to affect the outcome of the software they build and work on as they are not an equal to those making decisions.",1395858579

Everything else is just wasted time then.<p>Some examples:<p>1. Documentation. How do people know what your language means? How do they know what happens when it breaks?<p>2. Shaking out edge cases (much harder to do than debugging a program!)<p>3. Syntax. Picking it. Parsing it. Ensuring it&#x27;s complete and doesn&#x27;t have weird edge cases.<p>4. Compiler. Runtime. Parallel (!) runtime? Platform independence? Efficiency?<p>5. Static analysis (type checking, memory analysis, nulls)<p>6. Managing modules/files/packages<p>7. Foreign calls<p>8. Dependency management<p>All of these are fun in their own right, but most businesses would have a hard time arguing that they&#x27;re worth working on unless they&#x27;ve <i>already</i> got a language tied into their core value proposition. It&#x27;s also important to mention that there exist tools to make some of them easier (bnfc, llvm, &c).<p>But if you just start with an embedded DSL you can get right to the modeling or semantic issues by piggy-backing on the host language for (most of) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Try and work out from the functor laws why functors preserve shape. The laws are very straightforward:<p><pre><code>    map id c = id c\n</code></pre>\n(Mapping the identity function is the same as simply applying the identity function -- or with a little more category theory, the functor maps the identity function in the base category to the identity function in the functor&#x27;s category)<p><pre><code>    map f (map g c) = map (f . g) c\n</code></pre>\nThe second law is also simple -- mapping one function over the container then mapping another function is exactly the same as mapping the composition of the functions over the container. This one is the basis of stream fusion, a very important optimization, that allows you take two traversals of a container and turn them automatically into just one traversal.<p>The preservation of structure follows from just these two laws and parametricity (The element type of the containers is generic and therefore unknown, this greatly restricts what operations are available on the elements of the container. You can&#x27;t, for example, conjure up a new value of the element type to insert.). I strongly recommend trying to figure out how.",1402861492

Im curious to HN&#x27;s opinion of this attitude in the light of the OP. I think that the scenarios are different, as the SEALs training is specifically against something, but the founder&#x27;s depression arises from the against yourself. Possibly some of the lessons in the struggle for a good life and doing a good job that the SEALs have can be used to the benefit of founders and other tech workers. I think the quote I had there is a great one. When you are really in the dumps, go out and sing as a reflex.<p>Possibly a good way to overcome the depression that many feel is to develop a better sense of yourself, so as to recognize <i>when</i> to just reflexively start singing.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/05/24/manvotional-want-to-change-the-world-start-by-making-your-bed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/05/24/manvotional-want-to...</a>",1402860548

The computer scientists of today find themselves in the same disposition as the computer scientists of the 1970s: Only ~15% of the CS degrees were conferred to women. Then the late 1970s and early 1980s finally looked promising: With a peak at 37% of all CS degrees in 1983, it seemed as though Computer Science might join the rest of the majors with a more even gender distribution. But 1984 saw fewer women graduating with a CS degree, and the trend has followed a downward spiral ever since.

But how you go about doing it would depend on your goals, how much time you would have for it, and how much physics and math you know.<p>The thing about astronomy is that it changes quickly, but not <i>that</i> quickly.  The timescale for major changes in our knowledge of astronomy is perhaps ~10 years or so (that&#x27;s usually how long it takes a big problem to be solved), so it&#x27;s not as though it&#x27;s something you need to keep on top of every day or every week.  (Unless you&#x27;re a professional astronomer and want to be aware of all the new papers coming out.)  As a consequence of this, textbooks are a good place to start for background.  There are tons, but Carroll & Ostlie is a good general introduction to all aspects of modern astrophysics.  Each chapter also has general and technical references so you know where to go to learn more about any subjects that you find interesting.<p>For discussions of current problems in astronomy, the journal Annual Reviews in Astronomy & Astrophysics is a good place to start.  Current articles are paywalled, but most of them appear on arxiv.org, so you can search for them there.  They contain summaries of all the recent research on a particular problem.  If you&#x27;re interested in learned more about that particular problem, they&#x27;re a good place to start because they&#x27;ll point you to all the important papers on the subject.<p>Another good resource is ADS.  You can search for papers here: <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/default_service.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/default_service.html</a>  You can search for specific papers, or just search for papers with a particular keyword in the abstract or title.  There&#x27;s a handy feature that lets you sort by citations so that you can easily find the most influential papers.<p>Finally, you can find the newest papers here: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new</a>  About ~50 new papers appear here every weekday.  It&#x27;s a lot to keep up with even if you&#x27;re a professional, but it can be useful to skim the titles every now and again and see what looks interesting.  The introduction to astronomy papers usually acts as a sort of mini-review article.  It&#x27;ll review the problem that the paper is examining and will reference other papers that have looked at this problem.  So from reading introductions you can get some background on the problem and the ways that astronomers have been trying to solve it -- and it&#x27;s a lot shorter than a full review article!<p>Some of the problems may seem somewhat opaque if you don&#x27;t have the necessary physics background, but not all of them are, so don&#x27;t get discouraged!  Or if that inspires you to learn more physics, so much the better!",1402858829

It&#x27;s been a journey to put it mildly, but now I know myself better than ever.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read and learnt during these years, is that exercise seems to be the most effective treatment. This is the only thing I&#x27;ve not tried seriously yet.<p>Medication has helped a bit. I can say they are no quick fix, you have to give them at least 3-4 months before you stabilize and can start to reason about how you feel and how to proceed. I hesitated before I tried them, and feel that it was quite dumb and a waste of time to not take them earlier.<p>The last thing I&#x27;d like to mention, is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT. It worked really well for me. I managed to do several things I wanted to do for years, and the feeling was incredible to finally get out of the catch-22.<p>Here in (Nordic Country), CBT is not a crazy sign. I know a lot of people that go and have CBT sessions for things like to reason about how to unstuck their life, solve issues at work.<p>It&#x27;s no more weird than having a personal trainer at the gym.<p>From your wording it seems you really feel you need to do something. I don&#x27;t think your mental health will get better without you changing or doing something about it.<p>Perhaps you could take a few CBT sessions for your depression, but officially say it&#x27;s because you want to accelerate your career? Soften your friend and coworkers by sending them links to articles about becoming more efficient at work via CBT?<p>It&#x27;s really unproductive and shameful that mental health issues are so stigmatic.<p>Thank your for replying to me instead of just drive-by down-voting. I wish you luck finding a solution that fits you.",1402858824

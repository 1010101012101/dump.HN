This presentation method is probably the most inefficient way to do it.<p>The reason folks recommend resumes be a one-pager is because it's the best way to quickly digest information and see if you're going to be a good fit.<p>If you're going to use the web as the medium for your resume, make it something like a one-page scroller with the ability to easily jump between sections, minimizing the animations and maximizing readability.<p>Additionally, I'm not sure who you're shooting for as far as a potential employer, but I'm personally turned off by the ""Oh Hai!""

Speaking bluntly, most of the adoption is being driven by a struggle to keep the lights on, vs. a natural comfort with the cloud.<p>It would be interesting to share notes, but I'm finding the adoption is fairly peripheral (non core systems) with a large lock down on the data that is made available. Part of the problem is tech propensity, (in the U.S.) is partly regulation based, and part is because those making buying decisions simply do not use these tools.<p>It's going to be an interesting path forwards.

I don't have any illusions about siccing my nonexistent lawyer on someone who steals my photos.<p>But, I agree that photographers should be paid for their work. People and firms just want to get things for as little cost as they can, that's why they do this and that's why they try to get freelancers to do spec work.

It's your job to anticipate all the possible bad inputs, and guard against them.<p>Similarly, it's the job of the regulators to anticipate all possible routes around the regulations, and account for those.<p>Now, a bit of thought will lead to the conclusion that this is impossible except in all but the most trivial cases. I submit that this does NOT give us leave to shrug and just go through it anyway. Instead, it should force us to step back and consider whether the intended benefits of the regulations are great enough to counterbalance the cost of the complications that are certain to occur down the road.<p>(and I note a certain irony in your pseudonym ""intended"", since the problem here is UNintended consequences)",1326291083

It's a self-reinforcing circle, authors-> journals -> author prestige that doesn't even have to do with the quality of review (i believe all well known journals are equally good at reviewing science, what differentiates them is politics, and a careful selection of what subjects they publish). I 'd go as far as to say that this model is an impediment to science since most articles don't publish their research data (or simulation code) along with the articles. [And i must say that biologists and other life scientists seem really attached to that old model, unlike physics or maths].<p>Taking a step back you have to ask: Why are these publishing companies given such power by governments and universities (the power to determine grants and promotions). Why don't governments and universities instead actively promote open science? I argue that the benefits will be greater if we switch, but it's gonna take a quantum leap that's currently unlikely due to inertial forces.<p>Another thing is that when research article text is as open as a blog post text, you can create aggregators, get scientists to work in online communities.

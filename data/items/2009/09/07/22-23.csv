If you had such extraordinary predictive power about which technologies will be invented in what order, you could make a lot of money in the stock market.

I agree that such predictive power may exist in astronomy.  I disagree that such predictive power exists in technology forecasting, or pretty much anything involving humans for that matter.<p>If you continue to stand by this position, I will decide that you're not worth convincing and unlikely to be convinced and leave the discussion.<p>>Alternatively if we don't have the knowledge to make viruses and vaccines on demand, that won't stop mother nature from her never ending quest to kills us all.<p>""Mother nature"" has no quest to kill us.

A lightweight (fully self-contained in one <2mb file) distributed version control system, with built-in wiki and bugtracker, written by the author of SQLite. Since it stores everything in SQLite, the entire repo can be copied around as one file, and solid transactions are already implemented. (It's probably quite portable.) It doesn't look like it has a library/API to use it as a storage backend, yet. Oh, and it's released under the GPL v. 2.<p>Word of warning: <i>fossil open</i> (checking out a project from the repo file) tarbombs the project into the current directory by default.<p>At a quick glance: it looks easy to use, the bug tracker and wiki look decent.

It turns out that dealership location is a HUGE variable driving both pricing and decision to buy.  Some people need a car sooner than others; the dealership with inventory is more attractive.  The one close to your house or work allows you to get service and still get driven to your destination; buying from a dealership 100 miles away, even with the best price, may not help if you need service that only the dealer can provide (either free or something a local shop can't do).<p>No question, there is much one can do to shift the power.  But there is a reason why no one has yet gotten the car purchase process totally online: the dealers do indeed have some power. They control the distribution of the car to you, and they have location-based impact that, for some people, is important.  At the end of the day, you are buying from one of the dealers, and if they are all above your price but you want the car, well, you either pay more than you think you should, or change your car choice.<p>If you don't care about the ""free oil change"" services or other post-sales issues involving the dealer, and have the time to deal with multiple dealers and a potentially extended process... then go for it.  If you are in an area with few dealers for the car you want, however, you may find the negotiation requires a different approach than merely a PDG assuming multiple equal competitors.",1252362135

Neither is particularly “better” for image viewing – the difference between the two is trivial and irrelevant, except insofar as it makes images look different on two different machines.<p><i>γ</i> is mainly a way to align the metric in our color space with human perception: humans adapt to varying light levels, even in small areas of the visual field, and our judgment of color differences is relative (i.e. relative to magnitude, logarithmic) rather than absolute (linear).<p>Any operation that requires interpolating between arbitrary colors (e.g. image rotation, scaling, or compositing with transparency) will have errors introduced by any <i>γ</i> ≠ 1.0, so careful image processing applications should convert to <i>γ</i> = 1.0, perform whatever operation, and convert back, but in practice none of them do, because with sufficient pixels, especially if they're mostly opaque, users don’t know they should care.<p>But <i>storing</i> colors in 8-bit color with <i>γ</i> = 1.0 would be a disaster, because we’d be devoting half of our storage space to the very bright colors, while leaving the dark colors only a few levels of distinction: the darks would end up extremely noisy.<p>Incidentally, this last is the reason that digital cameras, even though they collect 10 or 12 bits per channel of data, end up with noise in the blacks: cameras gather photons and store them linearly, meaning that the light parts of the image are silky smooth because we can make many fine color distinctions, but not the darks. Hence the general advice to “expose right.”<p>Soon enough, we’ll just be storing and manipulating images in <i>γ</i> = 1.0 floating point, and thereby get the best of both worlds: operations are technically linear, but the encoding space is assigned logarithmically.",1252362064

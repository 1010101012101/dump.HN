I don't know if Planetary Resources has disclosed that. And then there's extracting the material. Yes, the sheer scope does mean a huge wealth... But it costs to access. And until I hear a professional suggest a price tag on that, I'm not too worried about it destroying economies.<p>(Or maybe they could extract it in space... But that would need new first gen technology, but at least retrieval from space may pay off in the long run, as they'll no doubt require space extraction eventually.)",1335506321

From the video games perspective, in Mass Effect you're at least three generations out from first contact, which was initiated by the military, although corporations quickly started exploiting planet systems for resources and became very wealthy, improving humanity's standing in the galactic community by the time of Mass Effect. You also have Dead Space, where corporations crack planets to get at their resources. It seems to be a general theme in space science fiction that big companies mine resources to become very wealthy, but you don't get stories of big companies financing space expansion a la East India Company.",1335506309

JPL has data [3].<p>You need to consider that:<p>1. It's expensive to get into orbit. Even at SpaceX's prices, you're talking ~$1000/kg for LEO insertion;<p>2. You need to get equipment to the asteroid;<p>3. You need to get to the asteroid. Proximity to Earth isn't the problem here. The problem is the delta-V required to match velocities;<p>4. You either need to bring back the entire asteroid, which would require a massive amount of delta-V, or you need to mine the asteroid, which would take a massive amount of equipment;<p>5. If you get raw materials back to Earth orbit, depending on the application, you may then need to get them back to Earth, which granted is significantly easier than escaping Earth's gravity; and<p>6. If you get a massive quantity of some valuable material it'll change the economics. That $20 trillion won't be $20 trillion with the added supply.<p>I am assuming this would be an automated operation as the cost of manned spaceflight is significantly higher and automated systems should hopefully improve in the intervening years.<p>Now, compare this to some other materials we have on Earth. Iron is pretty abundant (both on Earth and in the universe, due to it's energy relationship with fusion). On Earth, we dig up iron for under $30/ton and can ship it anywhere on Earth for another $50-100/ton (IIRC).<p>For the cost of a single SpaceX launch you'd need to bring back about a million tons of iron to be on the same scale.<p>Obviously that's why they're targeting much more valuable materials like platinum but I hope that puts things in perspective.<p>Our society is built on cheap and plentiful resources (fossil fuels, metals and minerals). As abundant as they might be in space, increasing the cost of iron 1000 times is going to have profound implications for our entire species. At some point of course recycling makes more economic sense but that's just a temporary cushion (eg you lose materials through corrosion).<p>I believe we're coming to a resources-crunch within the next 100-200 years that will result--one way or another--in a massive drop in population and a fundamental change in our society. Let's just hope we survive it.<p>As much as I'd wish otherwise I have a hard time envisioning space mining or even prolonged living in space as being economically viable in any way, shape or form.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/27/technology/business2_guidetospaceintro/index.htm?cnn=yes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/27/technology/business2_guideto...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3554_Amun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3554_Amun</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=3554+Amun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=3554+Amun</a>",1335506196

If it's spherical, it has enough to gravity to have made itself that way, and stuff probably melted and floated and sank and it's probably not the same on the inside as the outside. If it's not spherical, it's probably a pretty uniform blob of stuff all the way through.<p>They know what's on the surface by looking at IR and radio spectra. This is complicated by overlapping spectra from different minerals, but you can still get a pretty good idea of what range of minerals are there. And since we know the elemental compositions of the minerals on Earth that produce the same spectra, we can use that to predict how much of any particular element the asteroid contains.",1335506181

Heineken Cup 2012<p>The Heineken Cup is one of two annual rugby union competitions organised by European Rugby Cup involving leading club, regional and provincial teams from the six International Rugby Board (IRB) countries in Europe whose national teams compete in the Six Nations Championship: England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Romania competed in the first year of the competition only. Teams that do not qualify for the Heineken Cup enter the second tier competition, the European Challenge Cup. The tournament was launched in the European summer of 1995 on the initiative of the then Five Nations committee to provide a new level of professional cross-border competition.<p>Also i say that you find cheap tv processing program.

Per the BBC,<p>They struggle to see how it could be cost-effective, even with platinum and gold worth nearly 35 per gram ($1,600 an ounce). An upcoming Nasa mission to return just 60g (two ounces) of material from an asteroid to Earth will cost about $1bn.<p>(<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17827347"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17827347</a>)<p>So a back of the envelope calculation: Assuming that it costs as much to haul gold from orbit to Earth, and the Space X Falcon can haul 6.4+ tons per flight, we could bring down $167,116,800 of gold per flight. Since each launch costs $80M+, we're down to $80M of profit. However, this assumes we're just plucking gold out of orbit, not hauling asteroids to orbit, harvesting and processing the gold, and dealing with all of the logistics of this operation - which are bound to be very expensive. It's ambitious to be sure, but we're very far away from platinum as the new aluminum.<p>Price of gold per ounce: <a href=""http://goo.gl/htL7b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/htL7b</a>

of the imminent end of the world, _everything_ is soon food for the great
garbage collector in the sky and whoever is not scrambling in panic looks
like they aren't moving and have been passed by or are dying.<p>""the problem I see is not that Bill Gates has shaped the world of useless
trinkets in software, but has also managed to spread his competitiveness
and his personal fear of losing to imaginary competitors to businesses

which isn't happening, instead of getting about their own lives.  like,
if you aren't using today's fad language in the very latest version of
the IDE, you'll be left behind.  aaaugh!  but it's good that some people
run like they are scared out of their wits.  if they suddenly disappear
over the edge of a cliff, a good number of people will notice in time and _not_ follow them.  those are the ones that matter.<p>""you can scare most people most of the time, but you can't scare all of

We intend to use a Network based, Client-Server, Service based model with data processing both in device as well as servers under our control. We also intend to use Graphical Processing Units for device processing which involves Shape Deciphering as well as 3D mapping of local physical space. Combining these we have a model where we  have a database of text auto tagged in physical world via crowd sourcing, which can be put to further uses with Data Mining. The server classification modules take parameters from Google Search and other physical location data for providing accurate and instant results based on location of user.
Our project is intended to be provided as very good service for consumers in different mobile platforms and for commercial benefits we are just proposing this as an advertising platform.
Our team includes a couple of Materials Science Engineers working on Materials for Bionic Lens Display System, a Graphic Designer and a CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) coder. Further, we are awaiting patents for the technology.
Our budget requirements is driven by need for CUDA Servers for Neural Network Processing and mutual tie ups with mobile platform providers.
We will be delighted to provide more details.

However, you <i>can</i> force it into IE11 mode, assuming that the user&#x27;s machine does have IE11 installed. (And if you are producing a Windows app, customers who have refused to update their systems to IE11 are probably customers not worth supporting.)<p>Oddly enough, there is no API to do this. You have to write a value to the registry listing your .exe filename and the IE version you want to use. But this value is in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, so you don&#x27;t need administrator privileges or a UAC prompt to do this.<p>WebBrowser also sends an IE7 UserAgent string by default, but you can easily override that.<p>I posted the code for both of these tweaks in the MarkdownPad forum, where I was encouraging the author to use the WebBrowser control instead of Awesomium which the product currently uses:<p><a href=""http://forums.apricitysoftware.com/t/why-is-markdownpad-spawning-3-instances-of-awesomiumprocess-exe/172"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.apricitysoftware.com/t/why-is-markdownpad-spaw...</a><p>(Friends at Awesomium, don&#x27;t take offense! I just think WebBrowser is a better match for MarkdownPad, since it doesn&#x27;t need Chromium features and IE11 compatibility would be plenty good for their needs. They actually used the WebBrowser originally but switched to Awesomium because the author didn&#x27;t know how to force WebBrowser into IE11 mode!)<p>The problem I have with both Awesomium and Coherent UI, besides the large file size, is that they are both stuck on old versions of Chromium: IIRC Coherent is somewhere around Chromium 31 and Awesomium is in the upper 20&#x27;s. (Sounds like there is a new version coming out though.) CEF keeps much more up to date on the Chromium versions; not sure about CefSharp.<p>Coherent has nice integrations for Unity and Unreal Engine, including hardware acceleration, which was a real problem when I tried to integrate CEF into Unity a year ago. (This has no doubt been resolved by now, but at the time Chromium was going through a restructuring of the hardware rendering pipeline and CEF just bailed out on it for a while.)<p>I did a fun little project with Awesomium (originally for the late great OnLive) that composited multiple WebViews transparently on top of each other so each one ran in its own thread. Kind of like stacking transparent iframes but without the single-thread limitation:<p><a href=""https://github.com/geary/awestack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/geary/awestack</a>",1440035682

There will always be two camps in this; the tech savvy, and the web consumers who think Facebook is the Internet.

With very fine grained precision I can allow what traffic I want to see on my network, and I do not apologize for that. In the end AD blocking is about control structures trickling down into the consumer web. If it is the case where I am paid better than stupid people because I know how to serve them ADs better, then I suppose I win on a hermetic level; I have recast the purpose of a computer; which is something to do my bidding, and made it a mere device and gimmick for my users.<p>If on the other hand users are in control and I try to seize back that control, then I am in a silly game of cat and mouse, and this becomes a game of who can devise the smartest way to outsmart smart people.

Yes, we were always talking about people&#x27;s moral opinions, which are subjective by definition, and everyone has one. People who are morally outraged about what other consenting adults do with their private lives are <i>despicable</i> (way more despicable to me than cheaters that keep their opinions to themselves) and they have no right to harm other people because of their own morals.

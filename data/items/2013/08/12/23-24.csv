In weightlifting one of their leading coaches, Medvedyev, had a 7-year plan to take a promising 10 or 11 year from child to international competitiveness, planned down to the day.<p>As the plan progressed, the percentage of work dedicated to different training demands varied. By the time a trainee has pass into the final phase (Master of Sport International Class), he would only be performing the competition lifts for about 16% or 17% of overall training volume. The rest was taken up by a very large collection of assistance exercises, rotated as necessary.<p>After a while, the emphasis was on getting stronger. Their pattern of movement from tens of thousands of repetitions was sufficiently fixed that all that was left was maintaining the pattern and making them stronger.",1376351961

We don&#x27;t have to talk in hypotheticals with this though, we need to look no further than how business-minded owners treat repeat customers in real life.  Repeat business is preferred business.<p>Server turnover in practice is unlikely to hurt repeat business unless we are talking about unprecedented amounts of turnover on the period of days or weeks.  A churn period of several months or more is unlikely to dramatically harm repeat traffic.  Certainly I have never stopped visiting a bar because my preferred bartender left.<p>Furthermore, presumably if a repeat customer repeatedly gets poor service, then that customer does not care about the quality of service.  I get fucking awful service from the coffee shop I usually spend my Saturday mornings in (perhaps because I only take my coffee black, or perhaps because I refuse to tip baristas...), but I don&#x27;t care because I don&#x27;t need frequent coffee refills and I mostly like them for their decor.<p>tl;dr: If tipping <i>really is</i> bad for business, then the business owners would be fighting it.

6203091,comment,6199319,6200145,2,0,jfarmer,,,"The metaphors Tagore is using are confusing, at least to me, but this is definitely in the realm of &quot;Philosophy of Science.&quot;  It&#x27;s funny because I can&#x27;t really spot a practical consequence of the difference in their model of the world, functionally speaking.<p>Einstein says he believes there is a reality which exists independent of the human mind.  When we leave the kitchen the table remains, even though we can&#x27;t see it.  It seems like for Einstein this is less of a metaphysical belief and actually a scientific postulate.  I could imagine him saying, &quot;It might not be true, but I don&#x27;t know how one can do meaningful science with any other premise.&quot;<p>Tagore, OTOH, imagines a &quot;Universal Mind&quot;, compatible with certain aspects of our own mind, that &quot;anchors&quot; reality for us.  It&#x27;s this universal mind we&#x27;re discovering when we&#x27;re doing science, not some foreign reality.<p>To be honest, these two pictures of the world seem isomorphic as far as science is concerned.  That seems like it might&#x27;ve been part of Tagore&#x27;s point, when he said &quot;In a similar manner if there be some Truth which has no sensuous or rational relation to the human mind, it will ever remain as nothing so long as we remain human beings.&quot;  Here is a thing which could very well be true but nevertheless couldn&#x27;t be demonstrated scientifically.<p>In many ways his worldview reminds me of True Arithmetic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_arithmetic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_arithmetic</a>), which circumvent&#x27;s Gdel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorem at the cost of being undecidable and recursively innumerable.  As soon as we constrain our set of arithmetical axioms to something that a &quot;finite mind&quot; can handle, so to speak, we wind up with  true-but-unprovable theorems.<p>True Arithmetic encapsulates the whole universe of Truth when it comes to arithmetic, but in a way that makes it impossible for us to do any meaningful work.  Once we constrain ourselves in a way that allows us to do meaningful work, it becomes impossible to ever reach True Arithmetic.<p>This debate interweaves lots of metaphysics and epistemology, which are things scientists can and do discuss.  See, e.g., realism vs. positivism vs. instrumentalism vs. empiricism.",1376351789

6203085,comment,6202436,6202704,3,0,coinman,,,"In a way, bitcoin itself is not really a currency, or money, it&#x27;s more like an idea for exchanging messages. Bitcoin is really a decentralized messaging system which relies on cryptography and proof-of-work to maintain integrity. Should exchanging messages in the form of &quot;I owe you x amount&quot; over a p2p network be regulated or be made illegal?<p>However, The fact that it&#x27;s used as a form of currency is just an interpretation of what Bitcoin is. There can be other interpretations for what bitcoin-type system can be used for, for example Namecoin is used for name registrations. The judge declared that bitcoin is money by making an interpretation.<p>If anything, Bitcoin is just software. It will be very difficult to regulate.<p>1. Software using encryption is protected speech (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States</a>). Regulating bitcoin as in bitcoin the software would be a form of censorship.<p>2. Bitcoin uses many of the standard principles of cryptography we already use in e-commerce. Banning cryptography would have enormous consequences for the economy of the internet in general.<p>3. Banning or regulating p2p would cause an uproar.<p>4. If buying bitcoins in exchange for dollars is really exchanging a string of bits for money, then if this is banned or regulated, would it also ban buying software or other digital goods for money?<p>5. The regulations can&#x27;t be too broad, but can&#x27;t be too narrow. Would the laws restrict only bitcoin as a currency or other applications of bitcoin as well? If too broad, then they will unintentionally restrict other uses of bitcoin too. If too narrow, a new system will pop up again.",1376351702

This is the pattern we followed with Voldemort when I was at LinkedIn -- there was a heavy Java RPC client (which had a lot of client logic) and thin clients that (like parts of the Java client) used protobuf over the wire, but contained much less logic.<p>Problem with this is that it adds an extra hop (latency issue) and at times interface mis-match viz. local clients.<p>2) Only expose the protocol via the RPC, write a first-class implementation (given the full blown protocol) in major languages. Practically this means native &quot;fat&quot; client (whether in Java or C++) uses the full RPC wire protocol (but may use a higher performance server implementation) and works in the case where major languages are Java (or JVM-based) and C/C++: Python/Ruby/PHP/etc... use Swig or custom extensions to use the C++ client, Java has its own native client built in parallel. If you add another language without FFI to either Java or C/C++ to the mix (or there&#x27;s significant velocity mismatch between team working on the Java-based vs. C++ based clients/server) maintenance becomes an issue.<p>This is an approach I was following on my last project at FB with HBase (I&#x27;ve since left FB and am elsewhere, but the work is continuing and will likely be open sourced) for another distributed system -- where the proxy Thrift service always lagged behind the native client and where most heavy C/C++ based clients built their own thrift proxies to talk to HBase. Upstream HBase (and HDFS) -- FB has its own (open sourced) branch -- has also followed a similar approach with converting the native protocol to use protocol buffers for SerDe.",1376351209

6203012,comment,6201586,6201586,10,0,stevep98,,,"A couple of points I would like to make:<p>* Structural requirements<p>The hyperloop has much less structural requirements than a traditional train. The reason is that its cars are separated, so it is &#x27;less dense&#x27;. If a train goes over an overpass, the overpass has to be engineered to carry the weight of the rail and the train, whereas the hyperloop only has to handle the weight of the tube (30m between pylons at about 8 tons/m is 240 tons plus the negligible weight of the capsule).<p>The upshot of this is that the pylons can be much less invasive on the real-estate requirements. This is important because now you have more choices with regards to routes, which leads to less curvature and higher speeds.  Looking at it from the reverse angle, High Speed Rail design suffered because the massive real-estate requirements imposed such a burden that route choices were compromised, and thus the projected travel time was lengthened.<p>* Tube manufacture.<p>It occurs to me that there already exists expertise in manufacturing elevated, highly reliable large diameter steel tubes hundreds of miles long. Oil pipelines.  Moreover, these companies perhaps would be interested in diversifying their business away from oil.<p>* Development<p>High Speed Rail has issues, but they are political and financial, not technological. We&#x27;re really just buying the technology from other countries. Much of the cost and the incredibly lengthy construction time for HSR is coming from building overpasses and the foundations for the rail, so far as I can tell.<p>But hyperloop is something that requires some development. This is a good thing because investors can sell that technology and get some return.  It&#x27;s difficult to attract private funding for HSR, but I can definitely see someone stepping forward to fund the development of the technology.<p>Pretty much once someone builds the hyperloop demonstration system, you&#x27;ll know if you have a winner on your hands, but with HSR, you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll be successful until the whole thing is built (and with a 2:30 travel time LA->SF, it&#x27;s not going to be a slam dunk against air).<p>There are plenty opposed to HSR, but I see very few alternative solutions being proposed. This might be something those opposed to HSR jump onto, and it might get a lot of support quickly.",1376350896

6202997,comment,6201586,6202501,7,0,teek,,,"Train regulations are retarded in the US and haven&#x27;t been reformed for over 50 years. Basically if you plan on having a crossing or sharing track with a freight train you automatically are stuck with the FRA regulations which apply to freight trains and are also pointless. Those regulations require absurd rigidity of rolling stock to the point that train-sets built for those specifications actually are more expensive to maintain, fail more often simply (rolling stock becomes too heavy), and are much more unsafe.<p>For example FRA requires train rolling stock to withstand 800,000lbs of force on impact without permanent damage. The European requirement on the other hand is less than half of that. The European requirements instead aim for adding &quot;crumple zones&quot; to the cars to absorb energy and protect occupants similar to how automobiles use crumple zones.<p>This is why there&#x27;s an obsession in the USA regarding light-rail. Light-rail sidesteps the FRA regulations by creating a separate track and rolling stock that doesn&#x27;t have crossing with heavy rail.<p>I believe if we simply reformed FRA regulations we could probably cut all rail development by a sizable chunk as we would be able to buy rolling stock as-is from European and Asian suppliers.<p>But anyway, back to the point being discussed. A sizable chunk of China&#x27;s HSR network was built elevated so it is certainly feasible to put today&#x27;s HSR tech on pylons. But just because you elevate something doesn&#x27;t magically get you away from Environmental Reviews which I think is another area where a majority of the cost in public works project lies.<p>Environmental reviews will still be required for Hyperloop. Since it is actually a <i>new</i> system, I would expect it to get even more scrutiny in the public eye because it will sound even more magical and also offend even more people since there won&#x27;t be any intermediate stops. Remember that much of the California HSR political issues are because central valley cities and towns <i>want</i> an HSR station in their town (of course they don&#x27;t want to fund the station). So many of these towns basically come to the table and say &quot;we&#x27;ll give you the land if you give us a station, otherwise we won&#x27;t help you.&quot; The Hyperloop concept basically ignores this argument.<p>Keep in mind that despite environmental reviews having the word &quot;environment&quot; in them, they are actually also public hearings where the public can voice their opinions which can include things like additional noise and traffic. For example if your project blocks out the beach view of a home-owner&#x27;s house overlooking the ocean, you can sure bet that they&#x27;ll be at the environmental review and give you an earful about how you can&#x27;t build your tube/track/freeway/skyscraper/windmill there. Yes that&#x27;s a bit of hyperbole but that&#x27;s basically how the environmental review phase is abused.<p>Because of that, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that we won&#x27;t have any significant improvement in infrastructure in this country until CEQA/NEPA are reformed to allow not just public entities to build infrastructure, but also private entities as well.",1376350779

Basically, teachers have to force (induce extrinsic motivation) students to learn things, because the student has no greater goal (intrinsic motivation) which would flag the knowledge to them as being immediately relevant. If, on the other hand, the student needed to be able to know the sums of large numbers quickly while they had their hands full (for, say, estimating a fair tip as a server in a restaurant), they&#x27;d quickly <i>absorb</i> a mental addition algorithm--because they would have created a mental gap, a place where their plans say &quot;and then if only I could--&quot;.<p>The things that should be taught, I think, correlate highly to the types of things students will later wish they knew. These are mostly low-level rules and processes for things which are so &quot;obvious&quot; to everyone else that they&#x27;re <i>hard to communicate</i> unless you have a background in education. To flip that around, the kinds of things we call &quot;trivia&quot;--things equally simple or obvious, but as easily learned as said (e.g. a state capitol) don&#x27;t really need school to teach them--as, if someone later feels the need to know, they can just ask anyone, and pick it up on their own.

The immediate thing that sticks out to me in this proposal are the tight mechanical tolerances that have to be maintained. Talking about tens of thousandths of an inch tolerances on a 10&#x27; diameter tube is not to be dismissed lightly. That is going to be tough to maintain - especially with welding heat distortion. I would image the tubes will be joined with automated friction stir welding or something similiar, but that will still require a fair amount of post weld machining which has its own pitfalls. Not to mention simple thermal expansion and contraction as the temperature changes could change the circularity and inner diameter.<p>I would be more interested to see a tolerance stack up of those considerations than an FEA model of the concrete pylons. I can gaurentee that we can build concrete pylons capable of holding up a steel tube, that is done all over the country dozens of different uses cases. But can we build a multi-hundred mile long steel tube to the required tolerances?<p>I would be inclined to trade off efficiency for manufacturability. I.e. maybe a higher internal pressure or larger diameter to make it less sensitive. There should be plenty of power from the solar panels so it doesn&#x27;t have to be perfectly efficient.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised that the I-5 plan is cheaper than buying private land. I may be naive here, but the pylons really do take away most of the objections from farmers and installing tubes over farmland has to be a lot cheaper than doing construction above a highway.

However, it is difficult to prove that A and B (or perhaps every wallet in some long chain) are owned by the same person, especially if everyone has a large number of wallets and doesn&#x27;t reuse them when they are empty.<p>Let&#x27;s say the blockcoin shows a transfer of 1 BTC to a new wallet A, and then to a new wallet B, and then from B to a wallet owned by a registered BTC-USD exchange C; to comply with government regulations and protect themselves against fraud, C checks the ID of the owner of the wallet B. A government can now determine the identity of B (and might even force C to provide the information on all transactions in real time, so they know who B is even without an investigation), but they cannot automatically infer the identity of A. There are two possibilities: Perhaps A is owned by a different person, who earned BitCoin for doing some work, and then purchased another service from B. Or perhaps A and B are owned by the same person.<p>In reality, this might not be the only piece of information available, and governments will probably want to use statistical techniques to estimate the probability that a particular address is owned by a particular person, combining all evidence. They will likely take into account all points where money comes into or leaves a wallet with known identity (e.g. in USD -> BTC transactions or BTC -> USD transactions), and the structure of the network between those transactions. For example, suppose wallet A, B, and C are known to be owned by the same person, and someone moves money from all those wallets into wallet D. Then governments will probably infer that D is owned, with high probability, by the same person as wallet D (because multiple low probability pieces of evidence can combine to give a higher probability). Of course, the transactions are not independent, because the owner of A, B, and C might just be a regular customer of D - timing evidence might be taken into account, along with other evidence about the identity of D (for example, does D only receive money from the owner of A, B, and C, or from other sources?

They were useful for saving memory (2 bytes instead of 5) and not much else.<p>There were BASIC extensions published in places like Nibble and Call-A.P.P.L.E. that added native integer math to Applesoft using the & command, so you could write things like &quot;A% = B% &+ C%&quot;, and the operation was performed without conversion to real.<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget SWEET-16, Woz&#x27;s software emulation of a 16-bit kind-of-RISC processor on the 6502, that had 16-bit arithmetic. Reading the source code of SWEET-16 blew my young, impressionable mind.",1376348499

From what I know about PCI compliance, this is probably just a mistype and not indicative of anything actually meaningful. PCI compliance usually requires a quarterly security scan from a certified vendor. (The ""Hacker Proof"" ""Hacker Safe"" and similar badges are from these same services or similar.) These scans check your server(s) from the outside against a large panel of known-vulnerable software versions and common dangerous practices. They're useful tools, but no one should be misled into thinking they actually demonstrate security. The scans are typically passive only and don't do anything that could actually exploit a vulnerability or that require interacting with your site in any interesting way (such as logging in).<p>And it's not (as the article authors supposed) about removing vulnerabilities found in previous scans--you get the same (though updated) set of tests each scan and either pass or fail each time.

That's why they do it; even though it encourages people to carry-on, and that decreases plane utilization (longer turn times), it still makes them money.<p>(It also encourages airline loyalty.  Fly 25k miles on one of the legacies, and now checked bags are free.  I stick with the legacies because of the great loyalty programs and the ability to use the same airline domestically and internationally.  It is also nice to have an assigned seat.)",1269648471

If you fly Delta, you will become very familiar with ATL.  If you fly USAir, you will become very familiar with PHX or CLT.  Etc.<p>Even Southwest tends to try to funnel passengers through focus cities like MDW, but their network is largely point-to-point.<p>If hub-and-spoke is what would make baggage distribution efficient, WN should be the least efficient.",1269648247

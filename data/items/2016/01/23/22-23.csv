10960451,comment,10948238,10960140,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"F.lux is based on a very, very simple idea. It comes from the basic idea that &quot;white&quot; is not a universal when it comes to human vision, because not all light sources are the same. That&#x27;s why &quot;white balancing&quot; photographs is necessary, because you need to balance colors appropriately for the given light source. But our eyes do this automatically. If you take a white sheet of paper outdoors, indoors, wherever, it will generally always appear white to your eyes, even though its appearance will change color in an absolute sense.<p>This is where computer displays confound things, because they are a source of light, but they are used among other sources of light. And those light sources change over the course of a typical day. And thus the white balance changes over a typical day. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re using a computer in an office with white walls. Those walls don&#x27;t seem to change color throughout the day, but they very much do, because the light illuminating them changes. From sunlight to artificial light. Your eyes adjust to this naturally though. But computer displays don&#x27;t change, which means that during daylight hours your eyes might perceive the display as being normal while after sunset your eyes start to see the display as blue-ish or excessively bright. Alternately, your eyes could perceive your surroundings as different, seeing artificial lighting as yellowish and dim.<p>F.lux is simply an attempt to harmonize the white balance of your display with the white balance of your surroundings, based on some information about the type of lighting you have and the local times of sunrise/sunset. Once you get used to it it seems perfectly normal that displays should do this.<p>The problem is that a lot of the underlying technology (monitors, display drivers, OSes, etc.) are built on entirely different assumptions, the idea that the display itself is a universal arbiter of the &quot;correct&quot; color choices and there&#x27;s no need to white balance harmonize with the rest of the world. Which means that sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to get something as simple as F.lux to work on a given platform.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a topic of frequent conversation. It should really be a feature built into all displays and operating systems as it&#x27;s a very straightforward idea. And essentially every digital <i>imager</i> in the world is built based on a universal understanding of the need to account for white balance, but there is still an uphill battle in getting people to understand the need for white balance management in digital displays.",1453588638

Most companies only have five sizes (XS-XL) and the goal is probably to accommodate as large of a % of your customer base as you can with each of those five sizes. Most designers either use themselves to build their sizing from, or use a fit model, someone that literally is paid to stay the same size year round and give input on the fit.<p>After the decision on who, exactly, you want to design to, you need to decide how the individual garment should fit. eg. some streetwear might have a 4&quot; longer shirt from the high point shoulder than mine, if they like that long, baggy look. Some styles, like James Perse, may want a laid back, beach vibe, or cater to an older demo that might want a more forgiving shirt, so they&#x27;ll want a few extra inches around the waist.<p>In our case, I&#x27;m a very consistent medium -- almost every brand I&#x27;d expect my friends to buy from fits me well at a medium -- so I tailored our shirts to myself. We then started with what is a fairly standard grade rule to go up and down the sizes, and then after many, many batches, fine tuned each size to feedback from our customers.<p>So -- a lot going on. There is no way to standardize what a &quot;medium&quot; is across brands (and some companies don&#x27;t even use the same terminology!)<p>The frustrating part, as a consumer, however, is when a brand doesn&#x27;t have consistency between batches of the same style, colors within the same style, or between styles!! eg. I have a pair of Levis (huge fan..) on right now that I have the same exact wash, and style, but the 31 waist is MUCH bigger than the 32 waist. In this case, they were probably sewn in different factories, and they don&#x27;t have tight enough tolerances in QC, or something. Between styles happen because a big company like Nike, for instance, may have 100 designers, who may not want to re-use design elements/blocks from one style to the next - and would prefer to fit / design their new tee how they see fit. But as a consumer, I expect all Nike medium shirts to fit the same, so that is frustrating.<p>Turns out, sewing things by hand, and dying, pre-shrinking natural fabrics, etc. is really hard. We&#x27;ve been working on our processes for three years, and are incredibly proud of what we&#x27;ve built... but we learn new ways to improve every day!",1453588255

I had to stop drinking soylent for exactly that reason - crazy heartburn symptoms, only now starting to normalize after going back to eating what I normally eat.  I suppose it might just be as simple as an oat allergy, but it&#x27;s weird that the only negative symptom is indigestion.",1453586982

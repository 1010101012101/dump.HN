I have to wonder if you are being willfully dense; right now you are violently agreeing with me while nevertheless misconstruing everything I am saying.<p>My point, stated succinctly: <i>If a law cannot be enforced without violating the 4th amendment, it is not a legitimate law.</i><p>Alternative expression of my point: <i>""When the police cannot catch you legally, they are not permitted to catch you anyway""</i><p>Application of my point: If grow houses <i>cannot</i> be found <i>without</i> using drones, which violate the 4th amendment (or should), then grow houses should be legal.  Bans on grow houses should only exist if there are <i>legal ways of finding them</i>.  <i>If</i> there are legal methods of finding grow houses, than illegal methods should not be employed.  Of course grow houses can be found without drones, so no drones should ever be employed.<p>The <i>purpose</i> of this rule of thumb <i>(notice that I never claim that this principle could be effectively coded into law)</i> would be to provide the population with an effective way of telling Sheriffs to ""Fuck off"" when they say ""We <i>need</i> to violate your 4th ammendment rights to enforce this law."".",1350713494

If you take in account 80k is current salary, and most likely started at 40k and over 20 years raised it (lets say linearly), making an average of 60k over those 20 years, and paying high taxes, I doubt many would be able to save much as well unless your partner also worked. Also, Stockholm has quite high rents, looking at [1], studios start at around 1000 usd and small apartments at 1600 or so (not in central Stockholm, but suburbs)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bostaddirekt.com/Private/default.aspx?custType=0&Areas=7001&apmnt=1&other=0&Room=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostaddirekt.com/Private/default.aspx?custType=0&...</a>",1409669997
8257930,comment,8256009,8257864,2,0,jerf,,,"We have to cut ourselves a <i>bit</i> of slack here. Sure, 8-bit computers came up in a BASIC prompt... but they could default to a BASIC prompt because they had <i>nothing else</i> to do. Modern computers do. We do need to at least spot ourselves having to tell the computer to bring up this environment rather than something else... after all, if there are so much as <i>two</i> wonderful learning environments we need to be able to pick between them.<p>If you insist, you can build a kid-friendly distro of Linux, and then build custom computers to put it on which come up straight into this environment... but given that that&#x27;s been tried before, I&#x27;m not terribly optimistic about that shutting down the continuous stream of complaints of this nature.<p>And I guess that I know this is a popular opinion amongst a certain segment of the programming population, but the scientist in me can&#x27;t help but note the large number of times this has been &quot;fixed&quot;, yet, literally years and decades after the fixes, the complaints are still flowing, virtually unchanged. Personally I think the most likely explanation is simply that this is an incorrect diagnosis of the problem. Tempting, easy, seductive, but incorrect.<p>Further evidence for the incorrectness: Despite the way that many programmers got their start in this environment, I&#x27;d point out that far, <i>far</i> more people were exposed to this environment and still did not become coders, or worse, decided that computers weren&#x27;t for them. I don&#x27;t see any particularly concrete evidence that leads me to believe this was that special of an environment, once I discard nostalgia. At the very least we&#x27;d need to show some sort of difference between two environments without the confounding factor of a dozen orders of magnitude difference in performance, to say nothing of the other advancements made since then.",1409669977

Rather than do something (i.e. animate) and tightly couple the onComplete handler to N other things to do afterwards (via callbacks/promises etc) I prefer to compose my code around n-event subscriptions and react to changes.<p>Thanks to things like model binding (and their frameworks/libraries that offer this) the &#x27;immeasurable benefits&#x27; of decoupled and composable functions trump the spaghetti soup reactive Javascript requires.<p>(P.S. one designer is a step up from none!)",1409669937

They get studied, sure, but I think the customer is still working at the level of features and their expression in the plan, not the plans themselves which are more of an internal tool for the architect and builders. It&#x27;s true that we lack widely accepted formalized design tools like blueprints, but at the same time it&#x27;s interesting to note that one of the recognized problems with extensive planning and design documentation in software is that it can&#x27;t keep up with evolving requirements :).

It was easier to do it that way than to have widget or gfx break on rapid release -- that way we have the entire ESR cycle to get it right.<p>10.4Fx does have a JIT. Right now it&#x27;s a highly modified version of BaselineCompiler (I hacked BaselineIC to have better type and shape guards that take advantage of the greater ILP possible with the PPC integer unit), but I&#x27;ve had trouble getting our JaegerMonkey implementation to come into the Ion age. What we&#x27;ll probably end up doing is blowing it up and rewriting it based on MIPS, since MIPS does many of the same things we have to and is much more like us than ARM (they do lui/ori to load 32-bit quantities, we do lis/ori; they have a link register too; they have similar branch stanza requirements). We have an unusually large stack as well, mostly for the stack frame requirements of the ABI. I hope to have this ready by 38ESR.<p>Security is a concern for the browser. I hate relying on security by obscurity, but as you say, we&#x27;re a tiny segment of a tiny segment (while 10.4Fx will run under Rosetta, and some crazy people do, it&#x27;s not our core concern). We don&#x27;t run Flash or Java anymore because of Rosetta Flash and Flashback, or any other plugins, for that matter. Since Firefox implements NSS, that means we&#x27;re not beholden to deficiencies in the Apple-shipped SSL or NSURL. Heck, since Mozilla implements its own media libraries, we don&#x27;t have to rely on the system ones either.

What tables are essential for supporting this data?<p>Answering these questions will start to fill out a nice 30,000 ft view of the application and how it is actually used.<p>You are going to get the most bang for your re-implementation buck by identifying and replacing often used utilities (especially if they are custom built or built before a good de-facto standard was formed for that particular task) with modern, well known, alternatives.  Then follow the execution path of the most often used modules and the modules that work with the most critical data and work down the list.<p>With a 100 million line application, you are looking at many years to understand all of it and many years to re-implement.  To get anything useful in a reasonable amount of time you are going to have to boil it down as much as possible, then break what&#x27;s left down into independent functional areas and tackle it an area at a time.<p>The code is important, but if it were me, I&#x27;d try to analyze how the users and processes work before I&#x27;d dig into the nitty gritty of the code too much if at all possible.  I&#x27;d build the smallest functional unit from what I deem to be the most important and critical module(s) trying to cut as much cruft from the application and database as possible.  I&#x27;d get users and processes to start banging on the new app as soon as possible.  I&#x27;d keep the old application up and running and available to analyze (not for the users but for the developers and analysts) as the team works down the most often used parts.  I would not try to analyze the whole mess in one go beyond finding waypoints as described above.  If possible I&#x27;d also try to get users to understand that the old way is not necessarily the right way.  Much pain has been caused trying to make new systems work exactly like the old systems when the new systems don&#x27;t face the same constraints.  It is just too tempting to say &#x27;make it work like it did&#x27;.",1409668266

That doesn&#x27;t mean I shouldn&#x27;t do the dishes.<p>Agile recommends you value people and try not to put barriers in front of communication, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t have a plan, scope of work, estimate, etc. Nothing in the manifesto at least says that. If you&#x27;re doing fixed scope (yes, everything changes, but within reason it&#x27;s generally easy to differentiate), fixed bid projects, then not having a plan is a guaranteed way to generate re-work, burnout and budget overruns for any project beyond the trivial.<p>Planning happens, wether it happens ahead of time or just-in-time, it happens. Trying to do the inevitable rework while it&#x27;s still just paper is better for developers, your company, your clients, anyone.<p>I dunno, it seems like common sense to me. I get a contractor to bid a job in my house. The worst possible thing to happen is it takes longer than he thought and costs more. He can tell me all he wants about YAGNI and evolving understanding. My question to him is why he didn&#x27;t anticipate this wall might have studs every 16&quot; when I asked him to bid on the installation of in-wall speakers. If he&#x27;d planned it, thought through the process of performing the task each step of the way during the bid, then stupid stuff like this wouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>IMO the Software Development world is a lot like Contracting. Mostly capable people (and some brilliant), but more often than not it&#x27;s hard to find a contractor who can plan their way out of a wet paper bag. Sometimes there are good reasons for needing to change a plan. But not having one in the first place is not such a reason.<p>You want to thrill clients?

I have a smartphone and although I could definitely live without it, the only thing I&#x27;ve done is disable data. Rather, I&#x27;m too cheap to pay for data. What difference does that make, you ask?<p>One, on messaging, people would use text to contact me or each other if they notice that WhatsApp/Talk message hasn&#x27;t reached for a couple of minutes. And a call is very helpful to transmit high density info in short time.<p>Two, I can still use my very nice phone with a large screen to watch videos, read ebooks on the go like if I&#x27;m in a bus or something. The difference here is that these things are not infinity-sinks <i>in my experience</i> - I can go 1 hour or so reading a book on a cellphone but then need to take a break which is when you look up and around. Also, subconsciously, the <i>permanence</i> of the book/video prioritizes real world interrupts (in an embedded programming context) rather than blocking them.<p>Then, you always have music that you can copy to the phone and listen to if you don&#x27;t want to put your face to the screen. This enables you to move your head around everywhere and still not be all that bored because you still have that music going on.<p>If I absolutely <i>want</i>, which is almost never, I play games but I find that mobile games are not something that I like so it never comes up at all.<p>But a lot of time, I&#x27;ve just noticed myself looking around, just absorbing the world around me and being in my own thoughts rather than a forced stimulus and I find that relaxing unless I&#x27;m stuck in a very noisy environment in which case the earphone doubles up as a noise blocker.<p>And the general trend I&#x27;ve heard here is that you need to be on email. But work already has wifi and if you&#x27;re at work your computer is right in front of you. Secondly, aren&#x27;t you making a big mistake by configuring work email on your phone?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m the second coming of RMS but I do not install Facebook and Twitter apps on my phone for privacy reasons. Checking at most once everyday seems to be enough for me but I know that&#x27;s not the case with everyone. It seems a lot of plans are made over fb for you guys, which is understandable - we use hangouts and whatsapp over here, but primarily whatsapp. But more importantly, for immediate plans we generally use SMS and phone calls which might be why we&#x27;re not as reliant on facebook. FB is considered more of a public &#x27;show-off&#x27; billboard than a private friend group.<p>So yeah, maybe this was worthy of its own blog-post but my gist here is that turning off the data does wonders. You still get to retain those handy unit converters, two factor authenticators, password wallets and other things that are <i>yours</i> without the Skinner box annoyances of the infinity-sinks.<p>Of course, before someone rants &quot;You don&#x27;t know how important it is to have internet on my phone&quot;, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re obviously right. However, maybe after reading my post, you realize that it isn&#x27;t all <i>that</i> important then kudos to you. You should atleast try it once before knocking it right?

This doesn&#x27;t mean he can&#x27;t be fired for 3 months. There are various provisions for the company to do so (from probation period to lack of productivity or unfit for the job) but they do require some process (the employee has to be informed by writing, is entitled to some severance, etc). On this, and if the account is true is where the company maybe in more trouble. If he worked for 1 month and got 1.5 months of pay, that .5 maybe the severance he is entitled to (not sure about the values so I can&#x27;t specify if that is correct or not)<p>As for the generality of the Portuguese employment law, you usually have 3 kinds of contracts:<p>- independent contractor/recibos verdes: This is usually a business to business contract, where the &#x27;employee&#x27; has little rights regarding employment law except the ones provisioned in the contract itself. Employee also has to pay all taxes/social security. There has been some crack down on these as employers were abusing employees and avoiding paying taxes. There are similar provisions to this in the UK for example with their IR35, which means even if the contract is of this nature, they will be taxed as full-time employees.<p>- fixed term contract: An employment contract with a set end date (can be renewed for a certain amount of times). The usual rules apply regarding vacation, pay, firing processed etc. These regulations are law and while there is some margin to tweak the amounts, they can&#x27;t be modified or you can&#x27;t sign of your rights away.<p>- non-fixed term contract: This is what most countries have as standard employment contract but in Portugal it is a bit harder to come by. While things changed recently, up until a few years back, most employers didn&#x27;t want to do this contracts since firing an employee in this cases is next to impossible without paying a huge settlement amount. So employers usually did fixed term contract with new employees, renew them for the allowed number (usually in total used to be no more than 18 months) and then either let them go (with no severance) or move them to this kind of contract.",1409667658

The first first two &#x27;myths&#x27; are not something that Agile claims, and the last two &#x27;myths&#x27; are in fact true.<p>> Myth 1: Good design will emerge from the implementation of user stories ... However, in practice the code does not have this tendency to self-organize.<p><i>Code</i> may not self-organize, but a small team of programmers can.  It is not the implementation of simple user stories that produces good code but rather the ability and willingness of the team to constantly refactor the code.  The main point of Agile development is that you get better quality code written faster if you take a somewhat messy codebase and refactor it, instead of try to come up with a great design before writing any code.<p>> Myth 2: It will always be possible to pay the technical debt in the future ... However, in practice it is not so easy to pay the technical debt.<p>Agile doesn&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s always possible to pay technical debt in future, otherwise there would be no need to refactor code.  What it does say is that programmers have a tendency to overestimate the chance that the chunk of code they are working on will need to be clean and flexible in future (ie. &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Gonna Need It&quot;) and to overestimate the cost of future refactoring if it does.  A good example is copy-and-pasting: It&#x27;s generally fine to copy and paste a chunk of once or even twice - only on the second or third copy should you start to refactor it.<p>> Myth 3: Constant refactoring is an effective way to produce code ... However, in practice refactoring is consuming an exaggerated amount of the efforts invested in software development<p>There&#x27;s no question that constant refactoring takes as a significant chunk of time in Agile, but not much more than the design phase in other workflow processes.  And in my experience it is simply the way to maximise the long-term addition of value to the codebase.  It&#x27;s a bit like that old story about how the fastest man to chop down trees spends most of his time sharpening his axe.<p>> Myth 4: Agility can be assured by following an Agile process ... However, in practice the process alone is not able to provide change-resilience<p>Again, this simply has not been my experience.  The only time I have found refactoring to be painful and difficult is when the codebase has had bits of code gingerly tacked on over the years without any refactoring - and that certainly isn&#x27;t The Agile Way.<p>> The consequence is that some teams implement new features very fast in the first iterations, but at some point their work halts and they start spending most of their efforts in endless refactorings.<p>News Flash: It is ALWAYS easier and faster to write code on a greenfield project than a large, old codebase - dumping Agile will not change that. At the risk of sounding elitist or relying on the &#x27;one true scotsman&#x27; argument, maybe the author has simply not worked with people who are good at refactoring.  It certainly is a skill and many programmers don&#x27;t have it.  Here&#x27;s a great quote [1] written seven years ago on this point:<p>>  &quot;for me, a lot of the differences between the best programmers I&#x27;ve worked with and the worst are simply the quality of the abstractions when they pull out pieces of code to reuse. Often, even when it&#x27;s clear that someone needs to build a piece of reusable code to call from many places, the results will be very different. Some people are naturally good at producing clean and elegant abstractions to reuse, while others&#x27; abstractions tend to leak and be a little hairy looking, making them harder to work with.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2d2e0/theres_no_programmer_who_does_the_work_of_ten/c2d3zb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2d2e0/theres_no...</a>",1409667322

I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a software craftsman on this awesome team.

If your final goal is to rewrite all of it you are probably doomed to fail. You should first ask yourself (and your clients) some simple questions about why this insane project has been dumped on you and what the goal is:<p>What is the order of priority of services - which services/apps are critical, and which are not very important?<p>Which services actually need to be rewritten and which are working just fine?<p>Which services have a clearly defined interface and can be rewritten?<p>Which tests are in place to test the existing services, and which will you have to write?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t touch the code till you have answered those questions, and once you have those answers, having some sort of overview of code coverage etc is going to seem less important, because it will become obvious which bits need to be touched first (the ones that are both mission critical and broken), and which bits you can easily isolate.<p>You will find it very very hard to show concrete progress if you try to change all of this code at once, in a global way (for example by tidying up every single reference to a db to use a new db interface, or things like that).

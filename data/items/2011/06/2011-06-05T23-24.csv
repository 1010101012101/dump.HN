2623178,comment,2622909,2623150,2,0,viraptor,,,"Tbh, I haven't seen any standard syslog daemon supporting structured messages - except for apple's syslogd and syslog-ng. Others mostly cut the message to 1024 or so bytes and each one handles new-lines in a different way. So far it seems noone is sending messages that way and noone is expecting them. If a new protocol is the way to push structured logging forwards, I'm all for it. It doesn't mean those two protocols cannot coexist. It doesn't mean a typical logging pipeline cannot include syslog->gelf converter which adds annotations / parses the message.<p>It also seems that the structured messages handling assumes the message fits in a packet and can be processed dropped when convenient depending on its size. That's not something I expect from a logging system. Gelf adds chunking / compression just in case.",1307318391

They'll see a bug, tunnel vision on it, and wreck the whole code base trying to rewrite things to fix it. What's fun is watching them oscillate between two bugs over time without realizing it, fixing one while breaking the other, and vice versa.""<p>I have certainly come across cases when programmers created >1 bug while fixing one (chain reaction!), but never oscillations like the author mentions.  Has anyone else witnessed this?  If so, can you provide an example?",1307318326

I found this particularly true in the Limbo example.  I found myself intrigued, thinking about the idea of a whole game that worked like that.  It was strongly suggestive.  But the reality is that it's just a short clip, the rest of the world doesn't have to actually exist.  The ultimate release is likely to to make a variety of tradeoffs to realize the suggestions, which imagination doesn't have to worry about.<p>For another, a prototype only has to appeal to a limited group of people.  The important part is selling or proving the concept.  Customers represent a much wider array of tastes and while many will be drawn to a good concept, artistic elements are important too.  If you're the sort that's more attracted to a clever concept than the overall experience, a prototype is more likely appeal to you in particular.",1307318218

An MVP is when you offer a service X, but only build the capacity to handle, e.g., one customer, until you have 2+ customers. Sometimes this is done by not building anything at all, but rather by manually creating what the service would create for the person. The idea is that you only invest in automating/scaling/tooling up when you actually determine that there is demand, rather than building something for no reason. It's sort of like TDD: you have a facade (your storefront) that presents a finished product, and have customers make requests through itthen your business does the simplest thing that could possibly work to satisfy each request, only adding code/equipment/people/etc. when a request can't possibly be satisfied without it.<p>In the case of the article, an actual MVB (as done by someone who doesn't already own event-staging equipment) would be to put up the page, and then only rent the equipment needed if-and-when people actually set up an event.",1307317467

2623059,comment,2622747,2622989,2,0,Palomides,,,"I would observe that both cancers and viruses evolve very rapidly in the human body; in many cancer patients, a particular treatment grows less effective over time because the cancer evolves to be less susceptible.  Adding a virus that may just quickly evolve to infect all the cells in the body to the mix seems rather risky.",1307315006

With web browsers you lose the link between the software and hardware, it's too abstract and theoretical.<p>That spark of interest comes from seeing something real (which is physical and easy to understand), and being able to control it by using code. Think arduino, not emulation.<p>All that said, I am a web developer, the main reason I got into it was the simplicity of technologies like HTML, PHP etc. Whereas nowadays, even web development is dominated by abstract ideas like OOP, APIs and frameworks, so it's becoming less interesting in that respect.",1307314905

2208328,comment,2208103,2208103,0,0,mpakes,,,"One thing to keep in mind.. this article about 10 years old. The current engine configuration is a 90-deg 2.4L V8, rev-limited to 18,000 RPM. Typical peak power output is around 700bhp. Additionally, a team is allowed to use a maximum of 8 engines per season without penalty, which forces teams to run the engine more conservatively. This specification is frozen until the 2013 season.<p>Over the years, teams come up with creative ways to increase power output while still complying with the F1 rulebook. Then the FIA tends to ban the new methods or otherwise limit the engines in order to keep power output down. Power peaked in the early-mid 2000's with the 3.0L V10 format, with some engines producing as much as 950bhp at nearly 20,000 RPM.<p>The primary reasons for managing engine output are driver safety and development cost. In the early 2000's, Ferrari spent an average of $300M/year on their Formula 1 efforts. The cost to be competitive in F1 led to some manufacturers pulling out of the sport. Limiting engine specifications and the number of engines a team can use in a season has helped bring down the costs, and the sport now has a full grid of teams participating.",1297461522

Who is not buying a PS3 because of this?  Who has stopped buying games?  Nearly nobody, and the lawyers are on salary anyway.<p>The risk that Sony takes by allowing ""hacking"" to happen is that nobody will write software for their platform, and then the platform dies.  Content-creating megacorps want uber-strict DRM, or they take their ball and go home (or to Microsoft).  It's stupid of them, but Sony doesn't want to go to a meeting with a content house and say, ""anyone can pirate your stuff if they want to"".<p>Hence all the DRM schemes that don't work.  They are not to prevent you from copying things, they are so Sony (or Amazon, or Hulu, or...) can tell the content creators ""oh yeah, your shit will be secure"".  It's not, but they made the bean counters happy.<p>So really, this seems like the right action for a psychopathic corporation to take.  Maximize BS and maximize profits.<p>It's a shame someone with a clue is caught in the middle.",1297460344

There is no interesting new phenomenon being reported.

2208173,comment,2208056,2208120,0,0,boucher,,,"Absolutely. Along with the standard, ""talk to a lawyer"" advice, it's worth noting a few things:<p>1) Virtually every major technology company includes intellectual property assignment agreements in the paperwork they require new hires to sign. Most startups probably have the same policy, many perhaps without even knowing it, since its part of plenty of standard paperwork. Y Combinator's standard paperwork includes such a clause.<p>2) For all of the ones I've seen (and I imagine most respectable companies, and probably every company in California, for reasons to be mentioned), the paperwork claims ownership over anything developed a) during work hours, or b) using company owned equipment, resources, or IP, or c) anything that doesn't fall into the first two categories but that involves an area of business the company is active in, or has plans to be active in.<p>3) The reason California companies all have roughly the same language, is because those restrictions are what are specified in California state law. Given the nature of California in the tech industry, I would guess that influences what a lot of tech companies use as a general policy. The language is somewhat complicated by the third part of the equation, but generally I believe the company has to be able to show damages in such an instance.<p>4) There are no such general protections on the federal level, and I believe a majority of states do not offer those protections, meaning that in many states all work, and even in some cases all ideas, that you generate during your employment belong to your employer (if you signed a contract to that effect with the employer).",1297459133

This is for clinical research.<p>My own experience is that there is much constant questioning about published clinical research.<p>In addition, decision-making of clinicians based on clinical research is tempered with other considerations, sometimes quite complex. Stephen Paulker commented in response to the original paper:<p>""From the perspective of an epidemiologist or a statistician, the relevant question is whether the study's hypothesis is true - i.e., is the probability of H1 greater than 0.5. For clinicians and their patients, the relevant question is whether a particular strategy should be followed in an individual patient or a subset of similar patients. That decision (or recommendation to the patient) will depend on the pre-study likelihood of benefit in that patient and on the relative magnitude of benefits and risks of that strategy, if the diagnosis in that patient is uncertain. For many such decisions, the ""more likely true than false"" criterion may not be the best decision rule. For serious diseases and treatments of only modest risk, post-study probabilities of considerably less than 0.5 may be sufficient to justify treatment.""",1297459032

The boilerplate IP contracts provided by most law firms usually claims one of:<p>* All software development work you ever do while employed by the company.<p>* All software development work you do using in any way any resource of the company, from computer to network connection.<p>* All software development work you do related to the business of the company that employs you.<p>* All software development work you do that isn't explicitly listed in an exhibit of exceptions you, the employee, fill out.<p>Before you start asking how enforceable this stuff is, note that unlike with noncompetes (which usually aren't practically enforceable), the way <i>this</i> issue is going to come up is, you're going to try to start a company, and your first official act of business is going to be to start defending yourself against legal actions from your employer that will torpedo any chance you have of getting funding for the year or so it takes for those actions to resolve themselves.<p>So, 'grellas may chime in and say ""don't worry about this"", in which case ignore me, but I wouldn't dick around with this issue. If my IP contract precluded me from working on my next company project, I'd get a clarified official path to working on it from my employer, and leave if one wasn't provided.",1297458044

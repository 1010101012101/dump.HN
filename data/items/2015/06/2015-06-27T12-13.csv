We have built Tutanota with multiple layers of protection for our users. We currently use TLS and DANE to protect authentication and data integrity and (only tunneled) RSA-OAEP and AES-CBC to provide confidentiality. We have always communicated this transparently, it is nothing new. Neither the confidentiality nor the integrity of our users&#x27; data has been at risk.
However, we know that the implementation is not perfect regarding this detail. That is why we are going to implement the following features as soon as possible:
- Signatures/MAC
- 2-factor authentication
- Algorithms resistant to attacks of quantum computers
- Simple verification of downloaded Tutanota apps
Regarding the described issue, we know of two possible attacks on AES-CBC. Neither of them is feasible against Tutanota users:
- Bit flipping: You need access to the plain text email and you have to be the MITM. - -Plaintexts are available at the sender and recipient only. We use secure TLS algorithms and DANE to protect against MITM.
- Padding oracle: There is no padding oracle in Tutanota.
Tl;dr
There is no known vulnerability in Tutanota. Security is the heart of Tutanota, and we will fix vulnerabilities immediately.&quot;",1435409753

Scrypt is supposed to be very expensive to brute-force.<p>Quote:<p>The master key is a 64-byte secret key generated by performing expensive key derivation using the user&#x27;s master password salted by their full name. It represents the user&#x27;s global secret.<p>The purpose of this process is to deter any attempts at brute-forcing a user&#x27;s master password from a known site password. The key derivation is done using the scrypt algorithm, which guarantees that the process sufficiently time- and resource-consuming to make brute-forcing an infeasible attack.<p>The key derivation is salted by the user&#x27;s full name to prevent the generation of rainbow tables on the algorithm. This salt is not secret, and the user&#x27;s full name is chosen because it is an input of sufficiently high entropy while being (hopefully) impossible to forget by the user",1435409594
9789990,comment,9770322,9772968,0,0,Flowdalic,,,"You are absolutely right. I usually encourage people to get involved in improving the (XMPP) situation.<p>Just last week I submitted a XEP for unique stanza IDs to the XSF [1], which will most likely be the base for IDs in MAM and other protocols. I guess that&#x27;s the light reading you want. :)<p>And yes, Carbons (XEP-280), in it&#x27;s current state, also suck. I&#x27;m working on a replacement XEP called &quot;Message Routing 2.0 &quot; (MR2): <a href=""http://geekplace.eu/xeps/xep-mr2/xep-mr2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekplace.eu/xeps/xep-mr2/xep-mr2.html</a> It&#x27;s in an early draft state, but I think it addresses most, if not all, issues with carbons, improving the multi-device situation in XMPP somewhat (I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s MR2 or an improved version of carbons that makes the race).<p>> see how ridiculously difficult this makes the basic idea of &quot;all clients should see the same picture&quot;
Being involved in XMPP a bit, I get quite a few requests on how to implement WhatsApp/Hangouts like groupchats. And while the basic idea is quite simple, implementing it is a non-trivial task. But it can certainly be done. But we need more motivated developers and specification designers to get it done. While the XMPP community is just great, the count of activley involved people is quite small.<p>1: <a href=""http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2015-June/029865.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2015-June/029865....</a>",1435409473

    independent? A student is considered independent,
    for financial aid consideration, if he or she is
    or has at least one of the following: is at least
    24 years old as of Jan. 1 of the academic year,
    is married, is a graduate or professional student,
    has a legal dependent other than a spouse, is a
    veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, or is an orphan
    or ward of the court (or was a ward of the court
    until age 18). If not, the student is considered
    dependent. A parent refusing to provide support
    for his or her child’s education is not sufficient
    for the child to be declared independent.

    Financial aid eligibility is, in part, determined
    by a student’s dependency status. Independent
    students are treated differently from students
    who are dependent on their parents. However, some
    schools and programs require parental information
    on the PROFILE even if the student is considered
    independent based on the criteria above.

If/when those accounts get compromised, you create a new password for twitter.com with a version of 1.  The downside is that now you have to keep version numbers for each site somewhere, or change all of your passwords for everything.  :(",1435406526

They estimated that my Expected Family Contribution (just me now that I&#x27;m 25) was $17,900 based on the $57,000 of taxable income I reported last year. The problem is that the income was from SF and they have no mechanism for adjusting for cost of living. They did ask me how much cash I had in the bank and how much I had in assets, but it didn&#x27;t seem to affect their estimate. I haven&#x27;t received the official response yet.",1435406418

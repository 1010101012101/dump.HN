The C you have to write for cc65 to generate a somewhat acceptable program is very... unidiomatic. C&#x27;s machine model does not map well to 8-bit micros at all.<p>You can&#x27;t write a game for the NES or any of these old consoles entirely in C, some parts simply will not be fast enough to fit into tiny timing windows. At the very least, your interrupt routines (updating sound, graphics, and possibly scanline &quot;raster effects&quot;) will have to be written in assembly. Game logic has a bit more leeway, but you&#x27;d still run the risk of taking too long and losing frames with an unoptimized program. Given that, it may still be a productivity win to use C to &quot;script&quot; some optimized assembly language to make a simple game (kinda like how modern game engines use languages like Lua to script optimized C++), but I don&#x27;t think you can get very far if you&#x27;re just using C as a crutch to avoid understanding the 6502.<p>I think 6502 assembly isn&#x27;t as hard as it sounds (it&#x27;s fun!), but if that thought really turns you off, others have been much more successful with the C + optimized assembly libraries approach in the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive scene, where the standard dev tools are an older version of the GNU binutils + gcc for C projects. The 68000 is much more amenable to being targeted by a C compiler than a 6502 is.<p><a href=""http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14</a><p><a href=""http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1373"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1373</a><p>EDIT: Also, from experience writing some simple demo programs for the NES, I think understanding the PPU and writing a program that can be bank-switched effectively dwarfs the challenge of learning to program in assembly language.",1379624399

The biggest difference is that there is no global namespace for modules.<p><pre><code>    require(&#x27;my-dependency&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nreturns a value, rather than aliasing identifiers into the current scope. So you end up with code like:<p><pre><code>    var myDep = require(&#x27;my-dependency&#x27;)\n    exports.doSomething = function (x) {\n      myDep.doSomethingToAnX(x);\n      // more code here\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe Python import (and Go and probably others) works in a similar way, except that in node, even the module names (the argument to require) are local to each module. That is: `require(&#x27;my-dependency&#x27;)` can return different values depending on the location of the file that called it. This means your project can depend on two different libraries that both depend on conflicting versions of &quot;my-dependency&quot;. The mechanism by which this is accomplished is simple and straightforward. Another nice side-effect (as compared to Ruby) is that you can easily isolate a copy of any given dependency to monkey-patch or otherwise modify it, without affecting anybody else. (Not true of built-in globals such as String or Function, but that&#x27;s a shortcoming of JavaScript, not Node)<p>Of course, the event+callback architecture and preference for writing everything in a manual continuation-passing-style makes working in Node suck for a host of other reasons, but the module system is really quite nice.",1379622918

If one of my coworker has a   a long phrase password(high entrophy, but very memorable and therefore the coworker has employed) and I happen to take a glance at his screen, then notice his password as a tangible sentence, <i>I will remember it</i>.

The Japan Trench in the north, where the Pacific plate subducts, and the Nankai Trough in the south where the Philippine Sea Plate subducts.<p>These two subduction zones are very different. They&#x27;re on opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of earthquake behavior.<p>Before the Tohoku earthquake in 2011, we had never observed a magnitude 9 earthquake on a subduction zone like the Japan Trench in the north of Japan.  (The Japan Trench usually has frequent magnitude 7&#x27;s. Damaging but not devestating.) All of the previous magnitude 9&#x27;s were on subduction zones similar to the Nankai Trough in southern Japan.<p>Furthermore, southern Japan has a 1300 year written historical record of large earthquakes and tsunamis occuring every ~200 years (they&#x27;re not regular, but that&#x27;s another story). The last two were in 1944 and 1946. In contrast, northern Japan has just as long of a record, but no records of very large earthquakes and tsunamis.  (There&#x27;s some sedimentological evidence of a very large tsunami in northern Japan ~2000 years ago, but prior to this, we assumed that it must have originated somewhere else.)<p>Therefore, southern Japan has the highest hazard for large tsunamis, and northern Japan has a much lower risk.  Northern Japan&#x27;s risk is now higher than we thought it was, but southern Japan is still more likely to have the next big tsunami.<p>Notice that there are very few nuclear power plans on the east coast of southern Japan. Instead they&#x27;re on the west coast, away from the main tsunami hazard.  That&#x27;s why.<p>At any rate, the Tohoku earthquake really turned what we thought we know about very, very large earthquakes on its head.",1379621651

The trick is to analyze and understand the high volume usage patterns for your app and to target those for improvement. If you see that the vast majority of your users will take a next step to view content that must be web loaded, it may make sense to prefetch when the wi-fi or cell radio is already on so you can piggy back on the high power state and avoid waking the hardware.<p>> Besides, in my experience the biggest drains on battery life aren&#x27;t data transfers, they&#x27;re (a) having the screen on, especially when bright, and (b) being slightly out of range of a cell tower, and constantly dropping and reacquiring a 3G connection.<p>As someone who has encountered apps with bugs that do constantly make or maintain network connections, these kinds of bugs are a much more severe drain on battery compared to the screen.

6413897,comment,6413749,6413749,1,0,bloodyRevolver,,,"I feel both patterns are relevant for a particular context.\nthe important variables:\nA) will the user need to bookmark or revisit some of this data at a later point?\nB) is there a finite amount of data\nC)is the order in which the data displays crucial.\nD)is the Dataset updated /reorganized/regenerated frequently?<p>so obviously if the user needs to bookmark or get back to a specific listed data point quickly pagination will be a superior pattern choice. User : &quot;I need <x> and I know it&#x27;s on page<y>&quot;<p>If the order of the data is important it can go either way. Both scroll and pagination allow for this. Scrolling is advantageous because it does not limit the viewable data. While pagination allows the user to jump around the set in a predictable manner albeit with more clicks. If there is an indeterminate amount of data I think the point should go to the scroll pattern.<p>if the dataset is constantly updated or re-organized hands down Scrolling will be a better solution. recalculation of pagination on rapidly changing data sets is a nightmare The user&#x27;s mental position in a set will be challenged and getting through the set can be complicated and take many clicks.<p>Scrolling becomes much more useful if there is some form of visual aid with the information being listed. Google image search is a pleasure to scroll because the set that I am scrolling through is changing giving me a natural feel of exploration.<p>Pagination is much more effective on static, well organized data. A phonebook makes sense to have an index. each page could be a letter allowing the user to quickly jump from section to section based on their needs. A scrolling pattern could take hours to get to the desired data with a huge volume of numbers/name pairs. Without pictures, it also requires the user to read more which could potentially further slow them down.<p>The patterns are not mutually exclusive. Take for instance the phone book example mentioned above. Add pictures to each user and then have multiple scrolling pages paginated by letter. This would combine the strengths of both patterns minimizing the user&#x27;s need to explore, but also offering an interesting way to explore a directory.<p>Scrolling: spirit of exploration. Low level of interaction. Great when the user is only generally aware of what they need. Poor for searching using the UI (great for find on this page)<p>pagination: ordered targeting searching. Enables quick navigation, eases return trips to info. Poor exploration. disjointed for reading. High level of user interaction.<p>All said I really enjoy scrolling. I find it relaxing, Seamless when reading articles, and it frankly feels more natural to use. I think there are good ways to use pagination, however I feel that I see it used inappropriately more often than scrolling.<p>-Tom Marra Javascript Front-end Developer",1379621190

6413888,comment,6412708,6413211,2,0,maldeh,,,"the whole problem likely stems from this very bothersome definition of a hipster. At a baseline, a hipster is simply &quot;a person who follows trends and fashions in an ironic way&quot;. Different people have these other nuances and qualifiers that are applied inconsistently... &quot;they&#x27;re not a hipster unless they&#x27;re also shallow and facile&quot;... &quot;hipsters are attention seekers&quot;... &quot;a hipster is somebody who tries to be one, until it stops being cool&quot; and so on.<p>What irks me about these various definitions is that it&#x27;s as if people are having an academic debate about which pejorative or negative stereotype deserves to be christened a &quot;hipster&quot;, when there&#x27;s already a very diverse and complex community in existence that self-identifies as such. The only context I see such a debate making sense is when people have a perverse need to somehow preserve their ire and rage against the word &quot;hipster&quot; after being confronted with wholesome, happy counter-examples.<p>This poor bloke is a guy whom a lot of regular people would quickly slot down as a hipster, just from his looks and habits. He probably self-identifies as one too (because, hey, he likes the same music and dresses the same and it&#x27;s always nice to have a sense of community with like minds). And there ought not be anything wrong with it. Yet there&#x27;s an active hipster-hate community that&#x27;s not going to drill down into his benign motivations before shredding him up.<p>So what appears to be the way forward here? Collectively agreeing that it&#x27;s high time to dial back the rhetoric on hipsters? Or telling the guy who thinks he&#x27;s a hipster that he&#x27;s not really a hipster because hipsters are supposed to be jerkfaces?",1379621099

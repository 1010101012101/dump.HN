The strain on the back/shoulders/upper arms from holding the arms up for an extended period of time then forces the use of some kind of support for relief. The typical reason for either of these is too high a desk relative to the height of the chair, and a keyboard which is too far in front of the body.<p>If you hold your keyboard close in to your torso such that your back is straight, your shoulders are relaxed, and your upper arms hang loosely at your sides, then this is not really a problem. If you watch e.g. professional pianists or court reporters, or look at videos of secretaries from the 60s, you’ll see no palmrests/armrests in sight. However, you must also make sure to keep your wrists in a nearly straight, neutral position.<p>One intervention that might help is raising your chair relative to your desk.

Yet despite growing public support for environmentalism and preservation of endangered species, few people will speak out on the Guinea Worm&#x27;s behalf. In fact, the United Nations and several prominent U.S. agencies are leading a quiet campaign to eradicate this dwindling species forever from the planet. Is the Guinea Worm the world&#x27;s most endangered species?&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.deadlysins.com/guinea-worm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deadlysins.com/guinea-worm/</a>",1454850184

You might consider adding next/previous buttons near the top as well, but it looks very nice the way it is.<p>Any chance you&#x27;ll post the code?  This would be handy for some internal lists we have (that can&#x27;t be made public / archived publicly).<p>I like cron.weekly, too.  In fact, I just suggested it here in another thread several hours ago.  Keep up the good work! <i>(Edit: Just saw that you replied to that comment a bit ago.)</i>",1454850117

We are on a good way with polio and measles, but the uneducated and plain stupid people that refuse to vaccinate are a grave danger to that endeavour. \nAlso, the shortsightet and ideologic agenda of many &quot;ecological&quot; organizations for banning DDT was a huge setback in the fight for the eradication of malaria, as is now the zealotry against genetic therapy and stem cell research.",1454850089

It's bad design since then you'll be scrolling <i>and</i> manipulating the game at the same time.<p>The reason that this isn't a problem for Flash is because Flash grabs and steals <i>all</i> keyboard and mouse focus away from the browser; not something anyone should re-implement in JavaScript.",1287507562

I grew up in a state that had charter school mania, and it was always something like, some weird guy with a master's degree had a boner for Medieval Literature and his interpretation of the Origins of the University, so he'd start a charter school focused on Rhetoric, Sums and Figures, Swordsmanship, and Court Jesting (NO JOKE.). Or, some muslim elders from Somalia would start a somalian school catering to the special needs of somalian students, while simultaneously catering to the special employment needs of the school administrator's family who just arrived from Mogadishu.

I'm so used to its features that I have a really hard time using any other browser.<p>Some people think it has site compatibility issues.  That was certainly true back in versions 7, 8 and even 9, but with the latest 10.6 builds, I rarely, if ever, find a site that doesn't work.

Speed Dial - My top 20 sites sitting right on the new tab screen.  If a site isn't on my speed dial, I probably don't visit it<p>4. Address bar - type in anything and it'll search bookmarks and previously visited sites, including the site's CONTENT, not just the URLs.<p>5. Custom searches - Just right-click in any search text box and create a new search.  Assign the search a shortcut (g=google, i=google images, wi=wikipedia, tv=tv.com, etc)<p>6. Built-in IMAP/POP3 client - I use Opera's built-in email client exclusively for personal email. The email search engine is <i>extremely</i> fast.  Type in any word and get a list of emails in less than a second, despite having 25,000 emails indexed. Also, whenever I get email I get a notification right in my browser window.  The sidebas constantly shows me the number of unread emails, so no need to open Gmail in a tab to see if there's new mail.  I can also click on mailto: links and they work =)<p>7. Mouse gestures - Although I only use one, I can browser with out it.  I use right-click to left-click flip gesture to go back a page all the time.  I find myself doing it in every other browser and it takes me time to figure out why it's not working<p>8. Opera Turbo - I travel a lot and use a lot of crappy hotel internet, so Turbo is great because it compresses all the pages before downloading them, making my browsing much faster on the slow connection<p>9. Built-in RSS reader - Any page that has an RSS feed shows an icon in the address bar.  Click it to add the feed right into the Mail panel.  I have a whole list of RSS feeds I read right in the browser every day<p>10. Built-in ad-blocker - Right-click on any site and choose ""Block Content"" then click on the content to block.

I've worked for four boot-strapped-then-venture-funded startups and ALL of the founders at these startups have fallen for something like this at one point. It's pretty easy to fall for this. Startups are very frustrating and stressful, so when your in-house guys are telling you it's going to take 4 months to do something and some external guys are telling you it's only going to take them 1, you WANT to believe the external guys. And hey, they have the balls to ask for $200/hr, so they must be able to pull it off, right?<p>There are also legitimate scams, like life coaching or various overpriced seminars or ""consulting"" from ""strategists."" I won't comment on these as there seems to be a strong internet entrepreneurial contingent who thinks this stuff is very valuable.

Others take a focused approach to certain types of studies (math and science in particular). Others use rote memorization in order to boost test scores.<p>I believe what the original post was talking about though is something else entirely. Public schools are forced to take any student that is zoned to go there. Charter schools may pick and choose which students attend. In some cases this means that the schools are selecting only those students that will excel at the school thus making the school look better than perhaps it really is. There are charter schools on the end of the spectrum as well. My wife spent a year teaching at a charter school that took in lots of students that were behavior problems in the public schools and who's parents weren't willing to work with the administration/district. That school performs below the level of the public schools. If you look at charter schools, a very small percentage performs better than average, a very small percentage performs worse than average, and the majority are no better than public schools.",1287505615

Generally speaking, the greater the security, the higher the dollar amount you will be loaned. An example: A bank will loan you hundreds of thousands of dollars for a home, but only $10k in credit cards. Why? Because they mortgage security is the house. The bank has something to take. With credit cards, the debtor simply has to file for bankruptcy in order escape the debt. This introduces a level of accountability on the behalf of the lender.<p>Rewind to student loans. There is no accountability to the lender. You cannot escape student loan debt. Period. As a student lender, rather than evaluating the risk of default, I am left to focus on the debtor's ability to service the debt. I may even loan them more money than I think they can realistically pay back. Why? Because I'm able to borrow money at such low rates that I can generate a tremendous cash churn at a rate that is many times my borrowing rate. Even if I have to write off a portion of the loan value at the end of the term (the debtor dies or flat defaults and goes to jail), I'm still ahead of the game because I've been compounding my earnings for years.<p>It's a sick system with no escape for student debtors. The system was created to incentivize higher education, but the unintended consequence is that an entire market has sprung forth from a custom tailored opportunity for predator lending. Big surprise.",1287504095

It is determined by the balance of supply and demand.</i><p>That's true, but the market is ridiculously deformed on both sides of that equation. On the supply side, there are many who would like to be cops but the requirements bar them entry (most often for legitimate reasons, but I suspect not always). On the demand side, America's constant quest for new crimes to be defined and new police powers creates an artificial demand. I mean, most people I know don't see a demand for policing those smoking marijuana, but legislation forces it.<p><i>You can't be paid more than what you are worth</i><p>That depends on the definition of ""worth"". If you determine it rigorously as an economist would -- how much less money would the organization make without this employee -- then you're right. But if you define it in terms of the employee's productive contribution, it's a different story. Again, regulations cause some of that different (the need to have a figurehead owner who is a state resident, in some jurisdictions, is just deadweight but a requirement for doing business); in other cases it's contractual obligations (i.e., to be certified to sell some Cisco product you must have on staff one Cisco-certified engineer, even though you're not using his services as such).",1287504094

Timing and managing personal activities like showering, shaving, getting ready, making breakfast and so on is quite hard when you have multiple extrinsic factors barraging your execution. For instance, if a family is a multi-process program and each one of the members is vying for the slice of the CPU( house ), then you're bound to hit some spinning locks and unforeseen timeouts. Just try schedule bathroom use time. Deadlock, my friend.<p>On the upside, this would've been an interesting personal experiment if I figured out how to apply to my sprint of a day.",1287504024

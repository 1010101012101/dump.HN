3586823,comment,3585997,3586667,14,0,a_redditor,,,"I think you're missing the point of the users who see this new rule as a negative mark against reddit.  The admins have always been supportive of allowing any content that is legal, even up to a very specific definition, which is why these now removed subreddits were allowed to exist for so long.  Lots of people are making the slippery slope argument, saying things along the lines of ""how long before they ban /r/trees?"", which is a marijuana-based subreddit.  In response, the community organizer, hueypriest, said this:<p>>They'll ban /r/trees when they pry it out of our cold dead hands.<p>You can imagine why it might be frustrating to people who would expect them to approach all content with as much vigor as they do in the defense of /r/trees.<p>The way I understand it, and the way it has been explained by the admins, is that policing the kind of content that is now not allowed had taken up a significant amount of their resources, and it was becoming unsustainable.  However, a lot of users clearly see this as a sign that the admins are backing down as a result of legal pressure and also for the purpose of preserving the image of the community.<p>For users of old, this is a rather new phenomenon, and it is somewhat offputting.  If it was solely a question of sustainability (how much time are they wasting policing the content?), that would probably be acceptable, but it's difficult to believe that it is the sole reason for the rule.",1329159175

3586809,comment,3585997,3586636,25,0,redthrowaway,,,"Way back in my 888chan raiding days, we took special pleasure in tormenting Kimmo Alm and his legion of pedopals over at anontalk.  We regularly got hosts to dump him, payment processors to drop him, and when that failed (or we were just bored), we'd DDoS him.  We'd have months-long trolling sessions where we would get ourselves promoted to wiseguys, then wreak havoc on the site in whatever manner struck our fancy.  This is a fairly long-winded way of saying I am not a supporter of pedophiles or CP.<p>That being said, none of the jailbait subreddits had any CP on them.  Those who claim that this was a move against child pornography and child exploitation are being disingenuous.  There <i>was</i> no child porn nor exploitation.  What there was was suggestive pictures of minors.  The content was <i>distasteful</i>, not <i>illegal</i>.<p>Now, I firmly support reddit's right to ban those subreddits on whatever grounds they choose.  What's more, I think it was the right move to make.  I am disheartened, however, to see people conflate the content that was removed with child porn.  The images on those subreddits were largely pulled from facebook and the like.  Yes, there were a couple subreddits devoted to the so-called ""model"" agencies where clothed children were photographed in suggestive poses, and I find that creepy and distasteful in the extreme, but it <i>is not porn</i>, any more than the Victoria's Secret catalog is porn.<p>It doesn't do anyone any good to use disingenuous language to conflate the issues we're talking about.  Reddit got rid of about a dozen creepy and distasteful, but fully legal subreddits devoted to suggestive pictures of clothed minors.  Despite my misgivings about censorship and free speech, I support this decision.  That does not, however, mean that I am willing to use dishonesty to make those subreddits seem worse than they were, or argue that this was a decision about preventing child exploitation.  It simply wasn't.  This was about removing subreddits that the majority of redditors found distasteful and a black mark on reddit.  It was about avoiding another PR boondoggle like the one that followed Anderson Cooper's report.  That's all.

3586803,comment,3581442,3583034,1,0,pron,,,"> Facebook numbers came out. $1B profit. I think trading them 23x is reasonable.
Facebook's IPO valuation was $75-100B, not $23B. That's a 75x-100x multiplier.<p>>  In this case, possibilities are almost endless and I think you will see five years of strong monetary grow until, of course, everyone will jump ship for something new, more exciting.<p>I'm not saying Facebook will not be able to squeeze a healthy profit in the next 5 years or or so, but I don't think they'll justify the multiplier - maybe their stock will rise in the short term, but not enough in the long run.<p>What I'm ""seeing"" is that for Facebook's future plans to work their market penetration has to maintain itself at the current levels. If Google+ or Diaspora* and whatever other competitors that join the game take even a 25% market share, then plans that require ""almost everyone"" to have a Facebook account (like other services that use a Facebook-only sign-on) will no longer be viable). And, of course, the next big thing will inevitably arrive. Like I said, this is a ""black swan"" market, and the point is that you can't exactly see what it is that will cause the decline, but investors assuming super-fast growth must also expect a decline among the successful. And, again, the question is not whether or not a company will do well, but how it will perform relative to expectations.<p>>  Is Google a ""fad"" ? they grew similarly fast, and what? Still in business...<p>Yes, they are in business and doing well, but have already begun to disappoint the analysts. Also, Google has many products (many of them unsuccessful), and there were very few successful companies in history that continued to show good growth with only one product (oil companies, perhaps). By this time, Facebook should have had at least one more product that's showing a promise.

3586687,comment,3584104,3584993,9,0,jcnnghm,,,"The problem with the pointy part of spears, is that they are very small in relation to the whole.  According to Google's 2011 10-K, 96% of their revenue is derived from Advertising income.  So if you want to be in the pointy part of Google, you either have to work on the Adwords team, or be integrating Adwords profitably into some other product.  I'd bet that's a small percentage of Googlers, overall.<p>You know what I find really interesting though, the overall similarity between the Goldman Sachs and Google numbers, except employee compensation.  Google's Gross Profit (Total Revenue less Cost of Revenue) was $24.7B in 2011, and GS's was $24.5B.  At the same time, Google had 32,467 employees to GS's 35,700.  Yet, the Google net income was $9.7B compared to $4.4B on the GS side.  The difference seems to be made up entirely by the difference in employee compensation.<p>I think that the real reason people on Wall St are substantially out-earning people in Silicon Valley, is that they are in it for the money.  Working at Google is sexy.  They'll give you a free lunch for $220,000 a year, and who doesn't want a free lunch.  Plus there is a ball pit, and doors that don't function.  And a mythos about changing the world through social networking.  If one company on Wall St starts belt tightening, the top traders will jump ship in a heartbeat.  It doesn't take too many big bonuses before you can trade profitably on your own, on your own time.  Grab a few other traders with their own money, and pool the risk into your own fund.  Hire a few front-office sales types, and bring in other peoples money.  That's precisely why outsized bonuses exist in the first place.  The best traders are going to make big gains no matter what, with your money, their money, or some other firms money.  If they get big pay for big gains, then they'll stay.  Better to get a slice of watermelon that a whole grape for the trader, and the firm picks up the bulk of the profit.  If pay is even pretty close, how many people would realistically choose Wall St over Silicon Valley.  The money is there, but it seems like Silicon Valley engineers are too sheepish to actually demand it, nobody wants to come off as being in it for the money.  When people hear, ""I really want this job because I'm passionate about changing the world with twitter posts, or Facebook timelines, or amazing time tracking software"", they think, I don't have to pay this guy.",1329157118

I wouldn't be so fast here. The app store limits availability by country. For example, you cannot legally buy games here in Brazil on the app store [1]. Which is a huge market. I pirate a lot of stuff, and almost all of it I couldn't possibly have legally acquired. If pirating didn't exist, I would have never listened to Weird Al Yankovic's songs (I spent months with money in my pocket going from store to store looking to buy his cds when I was young), nor watched movies banned in my country for political reasons.<p>There is also the pay wall barrier. Which is also often derived from a location problem. You may have many easy payment options in the USA, but we might not have it as easy here. (There are many startups working on decreasing this barrier, but so far it's still big)<p>Also, your argument is subjective. You cannot make an objective case for ""how much potential damage"" piracy is making. You cannot know how many pirates would have bought if piracy didn't exist, maybe some wouldn't have bought anyway because of the paywall or location bans.<p>But what you <i>do</i> can prove objectively is that you <i>can</i> make money from digital content without trying to stop piracy. Which is the point that Peter Sunde is making here. Which was also the same point Steve Blank made a while ago [2].<p>So you cannot simply say ""piracy is a huge problem"" and just cite that link saying that some pirates exist.

These results, from Marcus and Martin Jacob, should not come as a huge surprise:<p><pre><code>    We compile a comprehensive international dividend and capital gains tax data set to study tax explanations of corporate payouts for a panel of 6,416 firms from 25 countries for 1990-2008. We find robust evidence that the tax penalty on dividends versus capital gains is statistically significant and negatively related to firms propensity to pay dividends, initiate such payments, and the amount of dividends paid. Our analysis further reveals that an increase in the dividend tax penalty raises firms likelihood to repurchase shares, initiate such repurchases, and the amount of shares repurchased. This is strong confirming evidence that when listed industrial firms globally design their payout policies, they take into careful consideration the relative tax implications of their payout choices.*</code></pre>",1329156275

There may be some lip service to online safety, but everything else points to pushing users to expand their networks.<p>As unintuitive as it seems to me, a sizable minority of people use Facebook as a way to meet others, either for dating (read: hooking up with your friends hot friends), shared interest, or just adding another source to the stream.

3586617,comment,3585997,3586506,19,0,baddox,,,"The whole point of this policy shift is that it's no longer about child pornography, just like the jailbait banning wasn't about child porn. The post makes it clear that they've always followed the law regarding child pornography, but that they're now voluntarily banning all <i>suggestive or sexual</i> content involving minors (so, not just child porn). Their main excuse is that they don't have the resources to moderate on a case-by-case basis, and I guess they think a subreddit-by-subreddit basis will require less manpower.<p>Still, I strongly suspect this isn't purely about legality. Reddit has come under fire (first, in the press regarding jailbait, and more recently by somethingawful users) for having content that's not necessarily <i>illegal</i>, but rather just <i>creepy</i>. Most of the top comments on this post share this interpretation, and most seem to approve of banning creepy content. If other commenters are to be believed, it also appears that many of the banned subreddits contained fairly ""standard"" pornography and either had strict ""no minor"" or ""no nudity/sex"" policies.",1329156172

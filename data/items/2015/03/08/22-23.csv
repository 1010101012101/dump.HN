I look forward to all the kinds of art history theoretical methodology used to explain the significance of Picasso or Manet in their respective time periods, to use the same kinds of methodology to reason about the relation between the internet and everything that is not the internet.<p>It&#x27;s interesting when some information gets washed away and other information is retained through time, and it isn&#x27;t always the stuff that is indexed that is retained. The idea that art critics can even agree to call the same collection of works &quot;cubism&quot; or &quot;impressionism&quot; fascinates me, and I look forward to the same kinds of invented vocabularies being used to describe various processes, movements, and patterns throughout internet culture (way beyond studying memes and tropes - there are so many layers to the collective psyche of the internet, it is dumbfounding).<p>I don&#x27;t know what geocities represents.

This team had a bad reputation at the organization, and I was supposed to come help them.<p>So I did a day of light training.

They didn&#x27;t want the rest of the team to know they were interested!<p>I firmly believe two things: 1) just about anybody can become a programmer given the right environment, and 2) Due to social issues, teams get &quot;out of whack&quot; and suck really big time. And when #2 happens, the other programmers always blame it on technical skills.<p>At a recent conference, I saw a guy talk about &quot;mob programming&quot;. Mob programming is where you take the entire team, say 3-7 guys, and work on one story at a time. There&#x27;s one terminal. One guy is typing and everybody else is planning and navigating.<p>He said it created a huge training opportunity for everybody because everybody was involved in every little detail all at once. People got the chance to compare notes. Poor programmers got better. Good programmers learned cool stuff from each other.<p>But the really interesting part was when he described doing this <i>in teams where not everybody was a programmer</i>. He said out of several experiments, in every case within a few hours the noobs were picking up how to program in that language. Within a week they were able to actively and helpfully participate along with everybody else.

I managed to pick up enough in 4-6 weeks using tutorials, manuals, and the engineers around me that I think I was as productive as you could expect an entry-level engineer to be (fwiw, I had a job offer on the table before finishing that internship).<p>I clearly remember two guys there. One was contractor, late-20ish and I think had started not too long before I did. The other was middle-aged and I think had been working for the company for quite a couple years. Both quite incompetent. At first I thought it was me, if I couldn&#x27;t explain something to them there must be something I&#x27;m getting wrong right? By the end of my term I had picked up enough, underhandedly, from other engineers, that these guys were incompetent. It was never openly admitted though. But these guys were given only the most basic, boring, tedious work requiring absolutely no actual engineering analysis.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these were 2 guys out of 150ish people doing FEA there, and all the others were absolutely brilliant and I learned a lot. But there are incompetent people everywhere, I think. In my graduating class there was definitely a 5% ish of people which everyone else knew were not going to be doing engineering work. These people often end up as production supervisors and such, never get their PE.<p>Even in grad school, they are tougher to find, but there&#x27;s definitely people graduating with MSc&#x27;s and PhD&#x27;s who couldn&#x27;t engineer their way out of a bag. Generally recruited by bad profs who do all the actual thinking and just give them narrow, grunt work to do.

I only use my CC when making a rare purchase online where I absolutely have to, or sometimes to book a flight or hotel abroad.<p>For everything in store though, debit cards are extremely well used. And as the debit card is connected to a bank account that offers credit, too, they function like creditcards. (and I can indeed use my debit card e.g. in the North America, China or Africa). So while &#x27;creditcard&#x27; numbers in reports aren&#x27;t as high as the US, cards that offer credit are ubiquitous.<p>In fact I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve paid with cash in the past 10 years here in Europe, except in clubs where paying with a card is weird (unless you booked a table which is a bit silly for anything other than a holiday imo) and that&#x27;s not a joke. I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s like in say Portugal, but I really don&#x27;t need to keep any coin around unless I go to the local market, a club or my shady barber. Where are you based in Europe?<p>Beyond that though my wallet is loaded with cards. Public transport, insurance, student id, gym (up until they moved to a fingerprint scanner), discount card at supermarket etc.<p>Given all this I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be carrying a wallet in the 2020s, any credentials that are on the chip in my plastic cards can go on the chip on my phone. Kind of scary in a way, cash is a bit like in-person communication, it&#x27;s not monitored the way that digital communication is monitored by government, businesses and malicious parties. The death of cash at some point means our entire economic life is recorded by banks which worries me every now and then, although it&#x27;ll probably be decades before it&#x27;s phased out completely and the majority of economic activity has been digital for a long time, but still.<p>edit -- seems you&#x27;re right! Two years ago the majority of transactions (53%) was still cash based. Much more popular than I&#x27;d have thought. Guess I&#x27;m a huge outlier. Debit has grown 15% since then so it might be slightly different today.<p>Still it&#x27;s not true that it&#x27;s necessary to carry a lot of coin, at least not where I live. Even at markets like this: <a href=""http://hoogeveenheefthet.nl/site1/images/stories/bedrijven/markt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hoogeveenheefthet.nl/site1/images/stories/bedrijven/m...</a><p>about 40% take cards. At supermarkets it&#x27;s virtually 100% and there are special checkouts for card transactions where you can&#x27;t pay with cash (because cash transactions are more expensive, take longer to process, have a higher error rate and make the shop a bigger target to theft).

Raw data that you fill out online and can be updated as you work on projects.

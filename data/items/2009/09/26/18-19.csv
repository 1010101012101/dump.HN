It's necessarily because of culture and social support and you're stupid for considering anything else.""<p>Postulating variations in the human brain is socially off the table, and perhaps this is the best way for it to be. The evidence people are willing accept as absolute proof that human brains are basically equal is weaker by several orders of magnitude than that which would convince them that there is any statistical difference in the brains of any populations.<p>One indication of this is that people who think that there is no significant statical pattern in variations of human brains never take that thought further toward interesting scientific questions. (For example, why have all groups of humans had the exact same evolutionary pressures on all kinds of intelligence, or why is intelligence seemingly unable to evolve in different directions, given that however you measure it it seems highly, highly heritable as shown by twin studies and other evidence?)<p>So basically, I'm just a mood to explore really politically incorrect and dangerous ideas, many of which may also be wrong. However, people who explore these ideas are not stupid, and reactions like ""duh, it's the society"" aren't really warranted. It may be socially irresponsible to think about ideas like this, and I'm agnostic about whether that's so. It quite possibly could be indicative of a very poor political sensibility too (see James Watson, Larry Summers.)",1253990474

845863,comment,843732,845167,0,0,apotheon,,,"You may not be aware of it, but the view command on (most?) Unix systems is basically a read-only way to execute vi.  It has the same keybindings in general, of course, because it's actually the same program with the -R option, more useful than more or less.  It's especially more useful because one can ""break out"" of the read-only limitations if necessary (and if one has the requisite permissions for the file in question), but one has to actively override those limitations.<p>Since the Web is, a lot of the time, basically a read-only medium with occasional need for limited editing -- and, when done well, it's a <i>primarily</i> textual medium -- the vi interface philosophy turns out to be quite appropriate.  If you dislike having to switch interface contexts between keyboard and mouse because you're a touch-typist who has learned the efficiency and power of a keyboard driven interface for text editing, a browser that does the same thing is a very attractive idea.<p>Unfortunately, most people's experience of text user interface browsers is limited to the shite that has been available for more than a decade, such as the ubiquitous Lynx.  While it's entirely keyboard driven, it's not a <i>good</i> TUI.  It is, in fact, a <i>crap</i> TUI.  Vimperator, however, has managed to improve on the failures of all other TUI Web browsers I've ever seen by importing vi idioms to the context of Web browsing -- improve on it so much that it blows away both TUI and GUI browsers, at least for me.<p>I also use a window manager with a keyboard driven interface, and I probably do more typing online than the vast majority of Web browser users.  With all that in mind, keeping one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse would be broken up a lot by having to get my hands back to home row on the keyboard so I could do things like type in the browser, switch workspaces and do work there, and so on.  At least 98% of the time, Vimperator obviates the need to keep one hand on the mouse the way you do it, which means there isn't any interface context switching going on in my brain at least 98% of the time for me, whereas without Vimperator I'd spend more like 60% of the time I'm using the Web browser also using a mouse and would have to switch back to home row every time I need to copy text to or from Vim in a terminal emulator (for instance).<p>Now, the only times I need a mouse in the browser is when I want to do something like click the upvote arrow here at HN or do something in a Flash object (such as start the Flash player, since I use Flashblock).<p>I used to believe that for the best browsing experience, a mouse was <i>necessary</i> for the majority of uses, because the Web is an inherently graphical medium.  Even essentially pure-text pages seemed that way to me, because things like hyperlinks are location-specific.  Vimperator has allowed me to learn the error of my reasoning in that regard.",1253990436

Hence they should have an input on where their money goes.<p>Note that investors do not pay to have exclusive access to Seedcamp companies on the final day. Seedcamp does not sell its services as a ""gatekeeper"". Instead, the investors have put equity into Seedcamp and Seedcamp invests in the winning startups. The amounts invested in Seedcamp are about 50K for individuals and 200K for institutions. Everyone is free to invest in Seedcamp (he should talk to them!).<p>Saul's point that the final day is closed except for the investors and invited mentors/advisers makes sense to me. It's a special day where the winners of Seedcamp are chosen, i.e. Seedcamp makes its investment decision. This needs to be a small session and behind closed doors.<p>Finally, any mentor or investor is absolutely free to invest in any company accepted to Seedcamp week or part of the final 6 - or indeed those that have been rejected by Seedcamp. You can invest before, during or after Seedcamp week. Everyone is totally free to choose where to put their money. The one exception is that as part of the selection process, Seedcamp does not want companies in Seedcamp week that already know they don't want investment from Seedcamp. Seems sensible.<p>So I guess this whole thing was just somehow handled badly or he was invited on another day and it wasn't really clear when that was. I am sure no one meant to ""kick him out of Seedcamp"". Part of the reason Seedcamp thrives is that there is this awesome network of mentors and advisers who aren't investors in Seedcamp and see the non-financial benefit of donating their time - for the ecosystem, for karma, for encouraging entrepreneurs, for improving startups. This is a completely voluntary process and mentors do it because it's fun. I think startups can benefit immensely from the advice, but I also find it hard to believe that any individual advice from a mentor can be measured in a potential equity return to Seedcamp and the Seedcamp investors down the road. The companies that deal best with mentors' advice are the ones that would probably have been successful anyway.<p>Disclaimer: I unfortunately wasn't at Seedcamp this year, so I also wasn't in the room when this happened.

845838,comment,845446,845755,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The ironic thing about bodily hygiene is that room temperature water is as good at killing bacteria as warm or hot water, incidentally its effect is negligible. Soap works better in warmer water, however as more and more people use liquid soaps and hand washes its meaningless as the added surfactants enable it to work just as well at lower temperatures. In fact many liquid soaps are better at removing grease and dirt at lower temperatures than standard soap is at better temperatures.<p>Then there's the whole problem that frequently washing your hands in warm water without a good liquid soap (which typically contain antibacterial agents too) can actually <i>increase</i> the bacteria on your hands due to the added moisture and temperature.<p>Dropping the temperature of your shower to room temperature will not only save you significant amounts of energy but will wash you just as well. In fact plumbing a cold water storage tank into your shower line and keeping it in a well insulated area of your house, you can spend virtually nothing on heating your shower water. Even adding a cold water storage tank to your shower line will likely cut the energy usage of your shower in half even if you take a hot shower. Most showers either run off a hot water tank (majorly inefficient) or an on-demand hot water system (either one that replaces the hot water tank, or a stand alone shower unit connected to your cold water line) and both ways end up heating ground temperature water: water lines stay at ~55F, room temp is between 68F-77F and a hot shower is 85F.<p>So even if you like a hot shower, simply adding a holding tank to the cold water intake of your shower can reduce the amount of energy you use phenomenally (potentially a 2/3 reduction). If you're in and out of a shower in 5 minutes, you likely only need a 25 gal tank, but for an average household I'd recommend perhaps a 100 gal tank, just in case.",1253989730

This wasn't an article arguing that it's a good idea to do it, but more of an exercise.<p><i>So your questions, does PHP really need all the added complexity of this?</i><p>That doesn't matter.  If you don't need it, don't use it.<p><i>Does it really help solve the problem, or did you just add a new maintenance nightmare?</i><p>This question is a false dichotomy.  First, it wasn't trying to solve any other problem then getting traits to work.  So yeah, it solved that problem.  Second, new code always adds new maintenance concerns.  Whether or not it's a nightmare depends on the quality of code, which seems to be above par in this case.<p>As Nycto pointed out in this thread, there is a ""Traits"" patch which seems preferable to this code.  It's likely that OP didn't realize it existed and did reinvent the wheel.  But still, in terms of an exercise in PHP, I found it quite cool.",1253989110

I'm Facebook friends with a number of people that I spend time with regularly, but I don't have their email addresses.<p>Here's why: it's harder to give someone your email address than to become Facebook friends with them.  For email, you have to write down a long string, keep track of it until you get home, and correctly type it into a computer.  For Facebook, you just say, ""Are you on Facebook?  Are you friends with Jon?  Just look me up on his friends list.""",1253989072

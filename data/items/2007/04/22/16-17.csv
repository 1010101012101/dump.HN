15744,comment,15613,15618,0,0,Leonidas,,,"I've thought about this for a bit and I really don't know who needs who more so I like to think a non-hacker needs a hacker both equally.  For example, if a non-hacker can't find a hacker, he'll go hire one.  Hiring one might not be the best approach but if you have the money to spend, why not? Of course it's always better to have a hacker as as cofounder.  Now, a hacker - can be business savvy so he wouldn't need a non-hacker.  <p>But lets think about this, you have a hacker who thinks he doesn't need a non-hacker.  Well, most of the applications that hackers most likely build is for other hackers.  When you speak to VCs, how many of them are hackers?  Or a bunch of hacker guys building a 'fashion site'...uh what do guys know about fashion.  In this case, I would go find a non-hacker chick to join the team b/c she'll know all the avenues and forum girls go to - marketing power.<p>You can build, but what you build won't always get users. I know there seems to be a view in Silicon Valley that MBAs are morons but it's wrong to lump them all into one group. I could easily say that a lot of hackers, while brilliant, may build something really 'cool' but so entirely 'useless.'<p>A hacker and non-hacker team is the best combination.  You both need each other equally.  There's no ""I"" in ""Team.""<p>",1177260756

The 'issue' here is that YEurope, the ""Y"" implies that you're associated with YCombinator...which is kind of misleading.  Secondly, the questions are exactly the same as the Y right down to the period.  The program could have reworded it, took out irrelevant questions or add some more like TechStars did.  Thirdly, the design of the site looks relatively similar to that of Y's with the huge sliding picture in the front.<p>If you want to use the questions right down to the period, might have been better if you emailed and asked the Y team if you could do that.  <p>I know its weird and you're probably thinking, who cares if they copy right down to the period? Its giving entrepreneurs a chance.  Yes, but at least give credit where credit is due.",1177259889

15739,comment,15628,15732,0,0,jey,,,"""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.""<p>Really, these guys aren't claiming to be YCombinator II. They're just validating the model and wanting to do something similar in Europe. They clearly state on their page ""This site is inspired by, but not affiliated with YCombinator.""<p>The YCombinators should be flattered, and everyone who participates in YC can give themselves a pat on the back for being funded by the original YC-style firm. [Hm, that has a nice ring: ""YC funding"" vs ""VC funding"". I wonder if that was intentional.]<p>Edit: Oh, now I see that they only added the disclaimer after a post in this thread called them out on it...",1177258353

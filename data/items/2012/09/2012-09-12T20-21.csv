Don't get me wrong, you'll get variance with deflate as well, but it's nowhere near the level of something like bzip2.<p>I do a lot of experimentation with new compression techniques for web demos, and I recently implemented my own compression algo from scratch based around the same building blocks as bzip2.  The variance I saw was just staggering; a tiny change in my source material would totally warp the output.",1347483596

Whether I have or have not suffered from depression has no bearing whatsoever on my ability to analyse the available data. Having had cancer gives you no insight whatsoever into the biology of cell division.<p>Depression is known to spontaneously resolve in the vast majority of cases without any treatment, which creates a wholly misleading picture of the efficacy of treatments for depression amongst patients. Our most effective treatments for depression only shorten the duration of depressive episodes by a few weeks and reduce the likelihood of relapse by a few percent.<p>I am not arguing that depression is a simple phenomenon, but rather that it is a complex psychosocial problem for which our best treatments are utterly marginal, and that the clinical model may be a fundamentally inappropriate approach.",1347483359

It really depends on YOU, your ability to learn, and your project requirements :)<p>First, there is trusty JSP and EL. They're blazingly fast. But they aren't a framework, there just libraries.<p>If you want full-stack Rails, but Java, Play isn't bad. I've used it once, but I felt constrained (much like I do in Rails). I probably needed to give it more time because it does do a lot of things.<p>The newest version of Tapestry isn't bad. They've had the same lead developer on this project for years, so they've really refined this project over time. You might take a look at the programming model and see what you think, it's can be a little different.<p>I personally like PrimeFaces/JSF2.0. It's good for large applications since the framework handles all the javascript and Ajax in a very elegant way. If There is also a rabid fanbase (check Twitter). There is tooling involved here, so expect a learning curve.<p>There's others I haven't used, but my IRL friends have told me they like:<p>GWT - Building single page, javascript applications
ThymeLeaf - The sucessor for JSP that uses Spring Framework
ZK JSP - A bunch of cool prebuilt widgets for JSP pages<p>There are many others, but I've only read about them. With Java, you have tons of choice. There is no ""one single killer framework"" for Java, so take a look around, and find one that suits your style.",1347483268

And now that prices are out, we can play with better guesstimates.<p>Anyone purchasing an iPhone will have a USB wallbrick and a USB-Lightning cable in the box. They can charge their phone from that setup, any computer, and any USB wallbrick Apple or any third-party vendor ever sold. So the ""upsell"" here, if there is one:<p>- Purchasing extra USB-Lightning cables for convenience (""one for the work PC too..."")  $19
- Purchasing Lightning-30 adapters for old 30-pin dock speakers and car adapters still in use $29<p>I'm guessing attachments will be about 10% for the extra cable and 10% for the dock over the life of the product. But let's say 50% for all iphone 5 purchasers.<p>With an estimated global sale of 80M per year, assuming 50% attachment for both, assuming 100% profit margin, that's $50 over 80M units / 2 = 2B dollars in an extremely optimistic interpretation.<p>Apple booked 109B in revenue in 2011, of which 2B would count for 1.83%.   They will do a great, great deal more than that by the time 2012 is over.<p>$2B in potentially increased accessory profit is a fart in the wind for this company. And keep in mind they're probably losing a substantial number of 30-pin licensees in this changeover, who already pay real money to get -their- access to Apple's vast platform of 90% margin accessories. We're just trading one proprietary connector for another.<p>Also, considering the obvious and real customer ire breaking compatibility causes, considering the obvious and real costs of redesigning and changing a part they've been ordering by the hundred millions for a decade, and considering the possibility that they might not even re-license any of their 30-pin accessory profiles, it can't simply be for money's sake.<p>The benefit for them moving to a dramatically smaller I/O port with a dramatically smaller set of supporting onboard electronics is in meeting extraordinary engineering pressure for reduced volume and mass in an era where many of their mobile products are nearly <i>the same size</i> as a 30-pin dock connector.<p>It's a new era.

It's one good choice among many.<p>Sure the first generation iPhone was just hands down better than the competition at the time, but it's not anymore.<p>Claiming that the look, heft, and hand feel are better is ridiculous, all of them are subjective opinions that vary widely among users (Take me for example, I really like the slate and glass look, but since I have big hands I dislike the heft and hand feel.)<p>Further, the thing is running a new version of the OS, so when you talk about the UX of iOS 6, what you're really saying is that you believe (based on previous Apple iOS releases) that they will create a good user experience.  That's branding.<p>And I want to stop and state: branding isn't bad.  If you've had a previous version of a product and you LIKED it, it's entirely reasonable to assume a future release is also something you'd like. but that doesn't make the device any better or worse, it just makes you more likely to buy it.<p>And finally, yes I agree that Apple has carefully curated their ecosystem so it seems clean and polished.  But it's not any richer (my opinion is that it's considerably less rich since it's so heavily curated, but again that's opinion). MOST importantly though, the ecosystem has little to do with the device itself, that same ecosystem could exist around any device (and does exist around older iPhones).",1347482757

I'd be interested in seeing some reviews of Metro from people who are using the MS Touch mouse rather than a standard mouse.   Perhaps Metro is designed with them in mind, so complaining about metro sucking with a standard mouse might be a little bit like complaining that the earliest versions of Windows were hard to use with just a keyboard!<p>The move from DOS to Windows was very much one based on the addition of a mouse.  Sure, some DOS applications could use a mouse, but it was not a necessary device for interacting with the operating system.  Windows changed that.  Yes, I know you could do almost anything in Windows with keyboard shortcuts, but it was painfully counter-intuitive to try doing so.  Since then, the mouse and keyboard have remained more or less unchanged.  The underlying technology has improved (e.g. optical vs ball mice) or deteriorated (most modern keyboards vs an IBM Model M), but their capabilities have remained almost frozen in time.  The last major degree of freedom to be introduced and widely adopted was scroll-wheels.  Some mice have other degrees of freedom, such as horizontal scrolling capabilities or zoom wheels, but none of these have become standards across all mice.  Interfaces have gradually coaxed richer interactions out of those existing degrees of freedom, but that's it.<p>Touch mice offer new degrees of freedom that traditional mice do not have.  e.g. Gestures.  If MS is smart, they are planning to develop Metro along lines that will exploit those new degrees of freedom.  It will likely take years or decades for touch mice to reach their full potential but, if the people at MS have done their job well, there should already be compelling advantages to using them with Windows 8.",1347482745

After all it just in the mind isn't it? Pull yourself together, get some exercise, eat a healthy diet, would have been my advice. I would also have been missing the point completely. Those are of course all good things to do and will help with depression. The point, is that depression makes you almost incapable of doing these things. Until you experience, either in your own self of through someone very close to you, the full manifestation of depression, you just actually don't have a clue.<p>You are a virgin trying to talk about sex. You may think you know the theory, you may be very widely read, but you are still a virgin.<p>Depression is a highly complicated and very subjective condition that cannot easily be diagnosed. It is far from scientifically understood. No one knows exactly why certain drugs work or don't work. This just makes it harder for the sufferers, who often have to undergo all sorts of different drugs/treatments to find one that works for them, that is if they are lucky enough to actually find a treatment that works.<p>I personally was lucky to find a treatment that worked. It was a combination of CBT and drugs. You can call it placebo effect, you can call it anything you want but for me it works.<p>I personally know 4 other people who suffer or suffered from depression. 2 of them recovered without drugs after many months, 1 without any treatment and 1 with the ""wrong"" treatment, i.e. tranquillisers. The third person, like me responded to CBT and drugs, albeit different drugs. The 4th person is not fully cured and suffers bouts. Any amount of different drugs and treatments have not completely controlled the condition.<p>I am not even sure why I am posting this, other than to try raise awareness that Depression is not simple, it can happen to anyone and often happens to highly intelligent, motivated people as well as your average Joe.",1347482581

A slathering of these <i>so</i> often during the entire event and then on with their advertisements makes me cringe and shake my head with disappointment.

But I couldn't compete with the salaries in Sacramento, either.  Let's put it this way;  I paid myself something like $40K last year (salary/profit whatever... I spent $40K on me last year)<p>Obviously, I'm unable to pay market rates for experienced/connected people.<p>Right after the .com crash it was easy.   Even through the mid '00s, I was picking up people I knew personally that had worked with me during the dot-com that were now stuck making sandwiches.   ""I can't give you much of a raise, but I can give you a raise and work that counts as experience towards what you want to do.""<p>Of course, that's harder now.  My latest two contractors are one very raw recruit who is local, and one reasonably good person that is in the midwest and doesn't want to move.<p>I mean, you find someone that could be good, then you train them, then you give them maximum flexibility and hope they stick around for a while.  Yeah, they move on, and that's okay... they then become the best resources for finding your next local raw recruit.<p>(for an example of 'maximum flexibility'  I don't have any set hours;  my employee shows up at the office maybe once a week, usually unplanned, and he often takes off on vacation with short notice.   I mean, yeah, Facebook has 'pet insurance' and they probably tolerate you rolling in at eleven, but they expect you to be in the office most of the time.)<p>But yeah, you hire when the economy is shit, and you do what you can to hold on when the economy is gangbusters.<p>The thing is, the people you want (as customers, mentors, and employees)  are thick on the ground here.  Like I was saying, for the same skill?  I don't even think you pay more here, because standards are just that much higher.<p>> What about commercial real estate? Even in Sacramento, it's just simply not feasible.<p>really?  huh. The only reason I don't own a santa clara 'industrial condo' right now is that my credit is shit.  (well, that and I don't have a whole heck of a lot to use as a down.)  warehouse space here can be had in the $100-$200 per sqft range, and you look at layfayette near el camino (a not awesome part of santa clara, but still, part of santa clara)  and you see nice big industrial condos starting at about $150K.    You can rent in santa clara, 1000-2000sqft places for $0.50-$1.00 per sqft.  (I'm talking essentially industrial units... but that's what I want.)<p>So yeah, uh, I guess I don't really see real-estate as a limiting factor.   (I mean, yeah, if you want to be in mountain view, it's rather more expensive.  But, I don't see why you would want to be in mountain view where you have to compete with google for real-estate when you can move to Santa Clara and have incredibly cheap power and incredibly cheap dark fiber provided by the city.)<p>Again, I think the key to understanding the economics is that while salaries are higher here, the standards for Engineer skill are proportionally higher as well.",1347481667

But that's even being transplanted by my Nexus 7, which is much nicer to use owing to lower weight - and bonus, I get most of the apps that also work on my phone.<p>iOS reminds me a little of DOS circa 1993, while Android feels a bit like Windows 3.1 of the same era. DOS apps were typically silos using custom graphics libraries, while Windows apps were drab but more consistent and had some pretense at integration (early OLE).",1347481062

Now, I want to change its properties and assert the opposite. I duplicate the line, change the property, and switch the ""should"" into a ""should_not"":<p><pre><code>    create(:user, :active => false).should_not be_active
</code></pre>
This is a very simple example, but I do things like this on a regular basis while writing tests. I assume other people have different workflows around this, but this works nicely for me. That's why I mentioned in the video that these are my own little timesavers, so you might not find them that useful :).<p>As for the predicate stuff, it's actually ""true or (predicate?)"". The idea is that switching to this would result in the first branch always being executed, unconditionally. I use this for view templates when I want to see how the page looks when, for example, there's no logged in user (it'd take more time to log out and then back in :)), or when the user has no trading accounts, or some other simple condition that I want to disable for just a sec to check out if some div got misaligned.<p>Really, the basic idea is simple -- if there's some code that you often need to change into some other code, you could store that transformation as a ""switch"" and avoid repeating yourself.",1347480515

4512858,comment,4512316,4512628,11,0,cube13,,,">Sorry, false dilemma and totally disingenuous. Just because no one promised it doesn't mean that one couldn't hope for it or be disappointed at its absence. Similarly, having big deal features like those are reasonable expectations for comparison to the original Iphone for ""bigness"" which I interpret as ""important new features that will change how most people use phones in a radical way"".<p>And I'm disappointed that Apple isn't giving everyone a pony.  They never promised it, but I'm disappointed that it's not there.  I was going to call mine Bob.<p>I fail to see how being disappointed when features that were never promised aren't delivered is valid disappointment.  Apple never promised it because they aren't doing it for this device.  It could be coming in the future, or it might not.  If, for example, Apple had made official statements about including NFC or wireless charging(not the ""rumors"" that seem to be the replacement for actual journalism in tech), then disappointment would be warranted.  But Apple hasn't done that at all.  Would it be nice if they included it?  Sure.  But they didn't.<p>This happens just about every time a new piece of tech is announced by everyone, and, quite frankly, it's getting annoying.  People complaining about how Samsung isn't doing retina-style displays on their midrange tablets.  Or complaining that Nokia is making Windows phones.  Or that Apple hasn't included everything that everyone has ever wanted in a phone.  With a cherry on top.<p>There are valid complaints about the new phone and news today: I'm skeptical of the reported battery life, considering all the new tech in the device, and that they made it that much smaller.  Or that the majority of the iOS6 features won't be available to the pre-4S iPhones.  Or that iTunes is still going to be a resource hog.  Or that there's a new connector.",1347480454

If, before the Web, I would have bought a product just barely useful enough to pay for, then post-Web, buy something different instead that is much, much better for me (has a higher consumer surplus), GDP will be the same, even though human welfare has significantly increased.<p>Normally, you can glaze over such a case, but the internet is basically filled with this kind of thing.  Moreover, a lot of the stuff that you would normally have to pay for, you get effectively for free, and I'm not talking about pirated movies.  I mean the collaboration, fact-checking, knowing of more options, info you'd normally need to buy a book for, etc.  Again, cash payments for that stuff might have dropped, but it made people that much better off.<p>So if people that were doing things obviated by the Web, then go start doing something different, then, well ""GDP is GDP"" -- but that is a massive efficiency improvement.<p>I don't know about human lifespans or manufacturing output (though the widening collaboration opportunity increases the number of people that can solve foundational manufacturing problems), but that's only one of many human values, and I think it's an artificial requirement to compare to electricity on that basis -- almost like penalizing it because it didn't enable better hunting of large animals.<p>So stepping back to the level of human welfare and modes of life it enables, I think the Web is comparable to electricity.<p>Here's an informal measure: what does the technology do to the ""quaintness"" of (non-sci-fi) stories composed before it?  After electricity, you might look at a book with a plot element ""character can't work at night"", and scoff at how backward it is.<p>Does the Web do something similar?  I'd say it does a lot more.  Per Steven Landsburg, there was a novel written in '91 (right at the Web's infancy) with plot elements like ""someone is endlessly searching bookstores to find an obscure book"" and ""someone sells expensive encyclopedias to people with a tremendous demand for easy access to knowledge"" -- very, very quaint from today's perspective.<p>(Novel was called, IIRC, ""Hunters and Gatherers"")",1347480452

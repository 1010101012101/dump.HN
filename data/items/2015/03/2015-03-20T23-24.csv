9241365,comment,9239411,9239411,0,0,eridius,,,"This is a very long-winded way of saying that libraries that are loaded via @rpath are vulnerable to having a malicious library inserted earlier in the rpath order than the actual library it wants to load.<p>But so what? That&#x27;s not at all interesting. The given examples involve inserting the library into the application bundle (because the examples of @rpath-dependent loads are for frameworks embedded within the application). This is trivially detectable for any codesigned application (as the inserted library won&#x27;t be part of the code signature), and for non-codesigned apps it should be just as easy to detect this at it would be to detect an attacker that simply swaps out the expected library with a new one.<p>Performing this sort of attack also likely requires administrator privileges, and an attacker that can get administrator privileges can perform all sorts of mischief on the system.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t subvert the app store sandbox in any way, because malicious code injected into an application is still subject to the same sandbox restrictions that the application is normally subject to.",1426895786

If there are already large areas under the surface to protect from radiation and they&#x27;re structurally stable, it seems like a great starting point. At that point a moon base only needs materials to make it air tight, rather than structurally stable, which means it would require getting much less material into orbit. It might even be possible to accomplish that with heat or chemical treatments of the existing moon rock, further reducing the amount of materials needed.<p>Since it&#x27;s also possible to produce oxygen from moon rock (<a href=""http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lnews/lnmar97/oxygen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lnews/lnmar97/oxygen.htm</a>), it seems like this drastically reduces the cost/complexity of a lunar base.",1426895705

If your conjecture is correct, then the submitter did a grave disservice by dropping a link to a 1950s article without any context. How do you conclude it wasn&#x27;t an example of climate change denialism, meant to muddy the waters and instill confusion, or a case of simple trolling?<p>&quot;Concern that the natural cycles were taking us toward a new ice age was quite common in the 60&#x27;s and &#x27;70&#x27;s, and reasonably justified&quot;<p>Concern by whom? Among the scientific papers of the 1960s and 1970s, the majority view was for global warming. Quoting from <a href=""http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/131047.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/131047.pdf</a> , &quot;The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus&quot;; &quot;The survey [of papers from 1965 through 1979] identified only seven articles indicating cooling compared to 42 indicating warming. Those seven cooling articles garnered just 12% of the citations.&quot; This is why I mentioned there were only a &#x27;handful of scientific articles which postulate a coming Ice Age&#x27;. Thus, that stance <i>in the scientific literature</i> was uncommon.<p>Among some of the popular press, there certainly were articles by Newsweek and Time on the possibility of a new ice age. (Or in SF, Larry Niven wrote &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1991) on the premise that anthropogenic warming was actually preventing an ice age from coming.) Then again, some of the recent popular press also had a lot of articles about the 2012 phenomenon, based on reaching the end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar - &quot;The Crazy Years&quot; of Heinlein. On the gripping hand, science popularizers like Issac Asimov understood the global warming topic correctly back in the 1970s.<p>Regarding &#x27;the messy uncertainty of the real science&#x27;, what you&#x27;ve said applies to everything the popular press reports. When the NY reports on the situation in Ukraine, they leave out a lot of the messy details. The same when Sports Illustrated reports on a doping scandal, or the WSJ about a recent merger, or the latest weather prediction in the local paper. It&#x27;s odd that you think people treat science reporting as the final, conclusive word on a topic. I don&#x27;t agree.<p>I believe the rest of your comment pivots into your views on nuclear power.

One of the greatest examples is, to my mind, Ted.<p>But, regarding to Ted, they have done something absolutely genuine: they run ads, yes, but at <i>the end</i> of the videos. And often the ads themselves are very high quality (comparing to the one on your average TV channel).<p>For me the benefit is twofold: I believe their behavior is rewarded by people, like me, who will stay and engage with the ads; because they don&#x27;t feel betrayed and because they might learn something new or interesting during the advertisement.

That amount depends on the amount to be suffered, and the amount benefited by the recipient. Once the suffering falls under that threshold, I do not believe the number of people required to make the sacrifice comes into consideration, as each of them if reasonable would say &quot;I prefer to belong to this world, where as part of a huge group I accept this small ill in order that someone else benefits&quot;.  Therefore, the implied sacrifice results in greater utility for that choice.<p>Let me try a different tack.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you observe a universe with some large number of people suffering dust specks in their eye.  That sounds bad.  But what if every single one of those people actually suffering thinks that this universe is better than the alternatives. You don&#x27;t suffer from a dust spec, but are you going to ignore all those people in their estimation of the utility of the universe?  If you switched to a universe where all of those people didn&#x27;t suffer from dust specs, but someone else was suffering, they would tell you that that was a worse universe.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious to me that even if that isn&#x27;t the exact case, it&#x27;s close to being the case in reality - that&#x27;s why people find the dust speck argument to be unintuitive, not the large numbers thing.

9241225,comment,9238639,9240343,0,0,graycat,,,"For a first cut point, CP67 permitted
running any code at all, including
CP67, safely.  At least once CP67
ran on CP67, ..., on CP67,
7 levels deep, on the IBM 360/67.<p>CP67 was an abbreviation for 
<i>control program 67</i> for the IBM
360/67 computer of, right, about
1967 and was developed by the IBM
Cambridge Scientific Center as a
means of interactive, time-sharing
development of operating systems.<p>Later commercial time-sharing services
used CP67.  So, could have a few
dozen users, each writing whatever
code they wanted, e.g., assembler
since it was a good environment
to make developing assembler code
easy, with, as far as I know, no
user ever hurting the CP67 code
or the work of any other user.<p>So, right, CP67 was the first
or one of the first cases of
<i>virtual machine</i>.  Its <i>security</i>
provisions appeared to be 
absolute -- run any code at all,
including privileged code, e.g.,
including operating systems, including
CP67 itself,
with full safety and security.<p>Two years or so later there was
Multics from MIT Project MAC.
It featured <i>capabilities</i> and
<i>attribute control lists</i>
(still with us).
As far as I know, they worked
fine.  For some years there was
a Multics in the basement of the
Pentagon and regarded as <i>secure
computing</i>.  Later Prime Computer
did something quite similar and
claimed that they had a prize
for anyone who could break their
security.<p>Later IBM revised CP67 and called
it VM, and since then it has been
from common to standard for 
the IBM mainframe operating systems
to run on VM instead of on <i>the
bare metal</i>.  There have been 
decades of high end production
systems running on VM.  I haven&#x27;t
heard about any security holes.<p>As of a few years ago, a list 
from Microsoft of security holes 
fixed included at least one 
based on a &quot;buffer overflow&quot; bug.
Gads:  If as recently as a few 
years ago Microsoft still had
buffer overflow bugs, one has to
question if by then they much
cared about computer security
at all.  Buffer overflow bugs --
that&#x27;s Programming 101 for
middle school.<p>I just checked Firefox 35.0.1
and couldn&#x27;t find where to turn
off JavaScript.  For the Web
pages at my Web site, I have
so far not written a single
line or character of JavaScript
and hope never to, although 
Microsoft&#x27;s ASP.NET does write
some for me -- and I do wish I
knew what ASP.NET classes or
options I used to cause 
Microsoft to write any JavaScript
for me.<p>The old first rule of computer
security was to separate code
and data, and never but never
let data from an untrusted source
run as data.  Never.  Not once.
For any reason.<p>So, in light of this first rule,
we have JavaScript downloaded with
the HTML text and markup of a
Web page and executed.  So,
I want a very, very, <i>very</i>
clear, careful, rock solid,
expertly reviewed, as close
as possible to proofs of 
correctness evidence that
it is impossible, absolutely,
positively totally, without
any possibly of exception,
for code, any code at all
that could possibly exist,
in JavaScript that could
cause my computer any problems
at all, and otherwise 
just block it.  Nothing to do
with it.  Dump it.<p>Computer viruses have cost
me about half my time so far
this year, and I want nothing
to do with more computer viruses.
JavaScript?  Totally glad to
junk it.<p>As I recall, not so long ago,
Firefox had Java enabled by default!
Outrageous.  And at times 
in Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer
had to be careful to disable
Active X, which could run
any code at all.<p>JavaScript?  I want nothing to
do with pull downs, pop-ups,
roll-overs, the screen jumping
around for no good reason, etc.
Just HTML and CSS -- fine with me.<p>HTML was just a word-whacking
mark-up language -- fine.
But, yes, for user input
it has text boxes, multi-line
text boxes, check boxes,
and radio buttons.  Okay.
Should be able to implement
those safely enough.<p>Can we start to take computer
security seriously?  When
are we going to start?<p>E.g., Microsoft has
gone from Windows NT to
2000, XP, Vista, 8,
8.1 etc., but where in there
is the solid security?
They have the Start button,
remove it, put it back,
the <i>Metro</i> interface,
tablets, phones, etc., but
what about computer security?<p>I don&#x27;t give even one weak little
hollow hoot about <i>touch screens</i>,
but I care a <i>lot</i> about computer
security.",1426893201

For the end users, garbage collection sometimes creates noticeable lag. That&#x27;s one of the worst experience we want to avoid. So for Echo, it&#x27;s almost always worth the tradeoff to reuse objects and avoid unnecessary new object creation, which means less garbage collection. But like you said, the middle-age objects could pose some problems in the future. Judging from the past trend, garbage collection will always be one rocky part of the Android land, which was quite a lesson for us when moving from the ios arc world :)",1426892755

Back in the day, Google SEO was shockingly easy. Looking back, I probably could have made many times the amount of money that I did with SEO.<p>All things come to an end, and eventually SEO became much harder. Fortunately, by the time that happened, I had learned enough to be able to pivot my business.<p>I&#x27;ve ended up building a business that I&#x27;m proud of. I get emails all the time from people thanking me for the free services I provide.<p>The OP talks about a lot of marketing techniques that have worked very well for him in the past. I think what he may have missed is this: A marketing technique is not a business. A business is a set of activities that create a sustainable competitive advantage. A product is not a business, a marketing technique is not a business, any skill, no matter how well developed, is not a business. A business is a system -- a combination of activities that hopefully support and reinforce one another.<p>I&#x27;m always looking for new ways to add stability and strength to my business. In fact, I get pretty &quot;terrified&quot; at any hint of weakness. Sadly, there are lots of hints of weakness. But, I&#x27;ve managed to do this for ten years.

6769162,comment,6767152,6767245,1,0,possibilistic,,,"I agree that there should be <i>legislation against</i> saving plaintext passwords. Otherwise there is no repercussion for these kind of parties that put confidential information at risk.<p>Honestly, people are not going to change their password habits, i.e. we can&#x27;t expect users not to reuse the same password at different sites. Moreover, I would wager that most people trust that websites are inherently secure and that password-related functions are safe.<p>The party to blame, then, is squarely the website that allows the leak of unhashed, unsalted passwords.<p>I believe we should seek legislation similar to HIPAA wherein the damages are inversely proportional to the ignorance and mitigation preparedness of the party to blame. (Damages might also be directly proportional to number of accounts breached, but only after the former is considered.)<p>As an example, imagine that a kid acting alone gets his forum or website broken into. There&#x27;s probably not much that a teenager would have known about password security. Additionally, they probably weren&#x27;t servicing millions of users as a part of a commercial service. You can apply this same kind of situational blamelessness to small businesses, clubs, churches, and so forth.<p>If, however, a multi-million dollar company gets breached, it&#x27;s a likely different story. Such a company has employed engineers that are familiar with such topics as scaling and cross-browser support. If these types of business concerns are known and handled, then it&#x27;s almost a certainty that they also know about password hashing. (If not, I would bet that new legislation would result in widespread education on the issue.)<p>If the cost of changes is estimated to be too high, we could even go as far as to lower or absolve damages if the 3rd party were to inform its users that its passwords were not hashed or not salted; a &quot;use at your own risk&quot; notice, if you will.<p>I feel strongly that we need to do something drastic about unhashed/unsalted passwords. This is becoming absolutely ridiculous; it makes our profession look like a circus show, and all for something that can be easily avoided.",1384966511

The original purpose of this talk was to discuss Zhang&#x27;s\nextraordinary work, putting it in its context in analytic number theory, and to sketch\na proof of his theorem.\nZhang had even proved the result with B \u0010 70 000 000. Moreover, a co-operative\nteam, polymath8, collaborating only on-line, had been able to lower the value of B to\n4680. Not only had they been more careful in several di\u000Ecult arguments in Zhang&#x27;s\noriginal paper, they had also developed Zhang&#x27;s techniques to be both more powerful\nand to allow a much simpler proof. Indeed the proof of Zhang&#x27;s Theorem, that will be\ngiven in the write-up of this talk, is based on these developments.\nIn November, inspired by Zhang&#x27;s extraordinary breakthrough, James Maynard dramatically\nslashed this bound to 600, by a substantially easier method. Both Maynard,\nand Terry Tao who had independently developed the same idea, were able to extend\ntheir proofs to show that for any given integer m ¥ 1 there exists a bound Bm such\nthat there are in\fnitely many intervals of length Bm containing at least m distinct\nprimes. We will also prove this much stronger result herein, even showing that one\ncan take Bm \u0010 e8m\U001000005.\nIf these techniques could be pushed to their limit then we would obtain B(\u0010 B2)\u0010\n12, so new ideas are still needed to have a feasible plan for proving the twin prime\nconjecture.\nThe article will be split into two parts. The \frst half, which appears here, we\nwill introduce the work of Zhang, Polymath8, Maynard and Tao, and explain their\narguments that allow them to prove their spectacular results. As we will discuss,\nZhang&#x27;s main novel contribution is an estimate for primes in relatively short arithmetic\nprogressions. The second half of this article sketches a proof of this result; the Bulletin\narticle will contain full details of this extraordinary work.&quot;<p>EDIT: it appears that copying and pasting from the PDF is problematic and please read the linked PDF if interested.",1384966302

6769139,comment,6751492,6759757,1,0,pron,,,"While I can agree with some of what is said in that article, the writer exhibits not only massive ignorance, but a basic misunderstanding of the premise. Because I studied both mathematics and history at university, I am very familiar with the mutual contempt people of those &quot;two worlds&quot; have for one another, but I think the reason for it that they don&#x27;t understand the premise of the other discipline: namely the axioms and the purpose. An HN comment is not the place to discuss this at length, but very briefly, the humanities and the exact sciences have different understandings of the concept of &quot;truth&quot;. In the exact sciences, truth is a model of reality that agrees with observations. In the humanities, truth is anything that can give us pause, make us think about ourselves and look at the world in different ways. For example, in the exact sciences, the statement &quot;the moon is made of cheese&quot; is simply false. It is disproved by observation. In the humanities, it could be &quot;true&quot; if you can imbue it with meaning that enriches you. If it makes you ponder the significance of the moon, or of cheese, to your life, and if it makes you consider an idea like &quot;the moon&quot;, which may be something beautiful but far away, is actually made of cheese, a mundane substance, then the statement can be true.<p>In short, neither scientists/mathematicians/engineers nor historians/literary critics are stupid (well, most of them aren&#x27;t). If this is your starting point, then if before dismissing the other discipline you realize that it&#x27;s being studied by smart people who know what they&#x27;re doing, and give yourself time to understand the premise, you might actually learn something. The writer of that article simply does not have the tools necessary to determine whether a &quot;reading&quot; is bogus or not, because he does not know what &quot;non-bogus&quot; or &quot;true&quot; is in the framework he has tried to explore.<p>Having said that, there was very little deconstruction in my interpretation of &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot;. In fact, I think it&#x27;s a pretty straightforward interpretation once you&#x27;ve decided to interpret the motto seriously. It is a literary failure on my part to interpret it so unimaginatively, but it&#x27;s only meant as a starting point.",1384966239

All of this is huuuge business, taken in total. All the gadgets and wars, all the dead people (&quot;even Americans&quot;) and all the people being spied on (&quot;even Americans&quot;), may not do anything to prevent terrorism, but they represent a real cashflow, that&#x27;s one big, fat fact. They also do provide a justification for total surveillance and the militarization of pretty much everything. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s all made up and just a scam; terrorists are real, and they&#x27;re not all &quot;created by being mean to people&quot;, sometimes people are terrorists because they&#x27;re dicks. <i>But</i> that doesn&#x27;t mean that a.) other parties can&#x27;t find ways to profit off all that, and b.) they can&#x27;t find ways to fuel the fire, either on purpose or by being <i>so</i> stupid and full of it, that there isn&#x27;t a meaningful difference between that actual malice, and the question becomes moot.<p>Why is terrorism objectionable? Because it destroys lives, and the lives of all those who live in fear. Not &quot;because it&#x27;s terrorism&quot;, but because of those and related things. So something done &quot;in reaction&quot; to that, and to &quot;fight&quot; it, especially when it is zero effective in actually fighting it, that does those same things, is a sibling of terrorism, not its counterpart.

The terrorism it &quot;fights&quot; does not cause as much pain to the American people as the actions of the military-industrial complex causes others, and, as sick and sad as it is to say that, it&#x27;s a thousand times cheaper.<p>You know how some people don&#x27;t light fireworks on NYE because they realized that&#x27;s just blowing money and dirt into the air for no reason?

Pandora and Google Music&#x27;s instant playlist do better than I would expect any people-who-like-x-also-like-y similarity system to do.

In Go, in our case this is fairly limited. So take that reason with a pinch of salt if you aren&#x27;t building a VERY well defined app with VERY small and skilled team. I don&#x27;t expect this to scale well.<p>The second part is also a niche value, whilst it will have some benefits for us running our hosted version of Harrow, it&#x27;ll have more profound benefits when we can sell binary installations to customers.<p>Finally, learning how to build applications in an API centric manner, without the crutch that is Rails has been interesting, and has made us all better programmers, we have a more interesting architecture now, and are making better use of our tools (we&#x27;re leaning heavily on PostgreSQL, triggers, stored procs, LISTEN/NOTIFY etc) and we have a faster system.<p>On the flip side of things, timing attacks are now really something we have to be mindful of. For instance the login endpoint returns &quot;404 Not Found&quot; regardless of whether it&#x27;s an incorrect password, or the account doesn&#x27;t exist. Except, interestingly we&#x27;re using bcrypt (we&#x27;re switching to pdbfk2 before the public launch) we need to look up the user <i>before</i> we can hash and verify the password. Meaning we respond in < 1ms when the user is not found and 4ms when the user is found, but the password is incorrect. (and 4ms when the password is valid). This also applies to a lesser extent in responding with &quot;404 Not Found&quot; when trying to snoop on someone else&#x27;s project/logs/build/etc. The same way they Github does. But it&#x27;s less critical there as there isn&#x27;t the artificially long password hash comparison step.<p>All told the decision to build in Go has made the <i>development</i> of the project slower, but has in my mind at least lead to a better quality of software, with things that don&#x27;t <i>typically</i> show up in Rails/et al projects (foreign key constraints, triggers in the DB).<p>Of course all these tools are sharp weapons if handled incorrectly, and testing triggers/functions in the database can be a nightmare from a unit/functional testing point of view.<p>We&#x27;ve avoided technology proliferation (the <i>entire stack</i> is Go, and PostgreSQL, with worker nodes which rely on LXC). The entire application uses three packages not taken from the Go standard library. (db driver and bcrypt library)<p>Ohh, and our test suite compiles, and runs (all of it.) in less than three seconds. That hasn&#x27;t hurt much, either.",1384965140

This is opposed to, for example, having to grind through the quadratic formula.<p>Try to mentally (or on paper) graph the freelancer&#x27;s pay. The x-axis represents &quot;hours&quot; and the y-axis represents &quot;pay per hour&quot;. The function we get is the linear function &quot;f(x) = x&quot;. I.e. for the first hour, he&#x27;s paid $1; for the 300th hour, he&#x27;s paid $300. A very straightforward graph. If we cut off our x-axis at $300, the graph looks like a right triangle.<p>If you want to find the total amount of money he&#x27;s accumulated, all you have to do is find the area under the triangle (which is a special case of integration). For a triangle, geometry class taught us &quot;Area = (1/2)(base)(height)&quot;. Calculus courses prefer that we integrate, which  has broader application. Integration of &quot;f(x) = x&quot; gives us &quot;f&#x27;(x) = (1/2)(x^2)&quot;. Our &quot;integral&quot; is equivalent to the &quot;geometry-class equation&quot; because for our particular triangle, <i>the base is the same as the height</i>. For comparison:<p>Area  = (1/2)(base)(height)<p>f&#x27;(x) = (1/2)(x^2)<p>DoubleMalt is saying kjay&#x27;s visualized &quot;shortcut&quot; (intuitively faster approximation) is slightly off. This is because the triangle in our <i>actual</i> problem looks like a staircase, and not a smooth slope. But kjay&#x27;s shortcut has a margin of error of only about &quot;-0.033%&quot; which is a good enough approximation by most people&#x27;s standards.<p>Also, DoubleMalt&#x27;s equation should look like<p>x * (x + 1) / 2<p>instead of<p>x * (x - 1) / 2",1384963290

They pulled a &quot;we don&#x27;t deliver in your area from Dec 20 to Jan 2&quot; crap and I had to drive 90 miles to pickup the package myself.  I told the vendor if they shipped the next package via FedEx, that would be the last one ordered[2].<p>I figure your local people are the determining factor since consistency seems not to be a corporate function for any of them.<p>1) mixing up Air and FedEx Ground will get you yelled at<p>2) we were getting parts and cables shipped overnight",1384963224

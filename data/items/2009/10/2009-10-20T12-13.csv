892292,comment,892163,892267,0,0,chipsy,,,"I don't think his presentation is great, but I recognized something I thought of myself, which is why I posted this. I would also like to offer my thought, which is:<p>Most of the difficulty in programming comes from defining data in relationship to other data, rather than to abstract value systems(which are what types and classes are).<p>If this is the case, then we should formulate the vocabulary and definitions we use for our data structures in a way that makes it as easy as possible to define and maintain data relationships, and correspondingly, easy to generate any kind of index or result set. If you do this, the nitty gritty of ""which data am I working with"" is gone. SQL is the obvious example of how this works, but it's tied into database systems, which are not the only use case.<p>The system proposed is table-centric. I don't think tables are special, myself. I think all collection types are worth considering based on their properties to define relationships. The model I'm currently testing out myself relates a single value to any number of property lists and collections and autoupdates all of them.<p>Functional programming is a strongly related concept to my eyes, since in that paradigm, processing on list structures is used and reused to define many sorts of relationships.",1256043206

It's the same way that all agency job descriptions sound the same, and certain types of resumes sound the same, and all detergent commercials sound the same.

892280,comment,891726,892147,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>The GPL increases your freedoms by forcing people to give back, for free, the work they've done on top of GPL'd work they in turn received for free</i><p>No, the GPL forces people to distribute the source code of their own modifications, but that's only on redistribution. That's why with software as a service this doesn't work.<p>This has to be emphasized, because that's its central strenght.<p>The <i>majority</i> of all software is made and run in-house, without ever being distributed. And open-source would not be what it is today without contributors that have SaaS as a business model.<p>> <i>The GPLv3 explicitly tries to deal with software as a service</i><p>No it doesn't. The GPLv3 is still only a copyright license which only covers redistribution (as GPLv2). It is more problematic because it tries to define what distribution means (to prevent tivoization), and copyright laws have their own definitions, but it still is within normal bounds ... so it remains to be seen if it works, but FSF has got some pretty smart lawyers over there, and they did their homework.<p>The license that tries to deal with SaaS is AGPL.
But that's not a copyright license anymore, and while it is considered to be ""open-source"", some people think that it shouldn't be, since it places restrictions on the actual usage of the software (like an EULA).<p>And you'll have a hard time convincing companies that have contributed to open-source to switch to AGPL. Hell will freeze over or a new gap in AGPL will be discovered before that happens. One way AGPL can be ""monetized"" is with dual-licensing. But that's just dishonest and definitely not free.",1256042640

There might be R one order of magnitude more keywords for R than for Perl, Ruby or Python (PHP doesn't count :) ). There are two object systems, none of them very intuitive. You need to learn functional programming. 1600 packages and counting means more functions and deep concepts to understand. And last, you need to understand the math of whatvever it is you are using.

892248,comment,890795,891793,0,0,dantheman,,,"Oh I don't care if it's based on gold or some other physical asset, my only concern is that it can't be created out of thin air.  Throughout history governments have struggled to get control of the monetary supply, separate it from anything real (give it a name deutschmark, pound, dollar), and then create more of it out of thin air.  In this way they are taxing everyone who holds that currency without there direct knowledge.  Eventually the money becomes worthless.<p>In general people are against central planning when it comes to goods and services, but are in favor of it when it comes to monetary supply for some reason that I don't understand.  Throughout the history of central banking in the united states we've had all of the worst financial crises and extreme loss of value (the dollar has lost 98%) of it's value since the federal reserve took over.<p>I also have a problem with the way the new money enters the system.  As it enters the market those who get the new money first are able to use it on prices that are set for the old monetary supply so they get great deals, over time prices will rise hurting those not receiving the new money.<p>Lastly,  I have no problem with banks, but I do have problems with fractional reserve banking -- as I stated above I feel it's fraudulent.  I do believe that through fractional reserve and fiat currency, money is produced is such great speed that when investing one must take inflation into account and seek out riskier and riskier investments to try and make any decent return.  It adds one more variable to be considered whenever making a decision, for instance Harvard just lost 500Million due to an interest rate swap agreement because they didn't predict the Fed would hold interest rates at zero for so long.<p>Lastly, if a currency is good it doesn't have to be forced upon you; if people actually believed in fiat currencies they would allow competing systems and abolish legal tender laws.<p>I'd be more than happy to answer any other questions/clear up any misconceptions about this issue -- It's important to me.",1256040794

The actual result:  They went outside, for reasons well explained.<p>Our group made a recommendation to a local business to restructure, letting a key person go.  We got an ""F"" on the project, with the opportunity to go back and redo it without letting anyone go.

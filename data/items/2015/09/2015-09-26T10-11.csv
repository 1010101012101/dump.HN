We got approximately nowhere until we were able to convince a sales guy to join us, who had connections all over the City. He got us a bunch of sales, dramatically increasing our revenue and that we can upsell later, and then recommended we bring in another guy. He in turn has run sales for some very large organizations, and cherry-picked another two people, one in the US, one in Luxembourg, who had a large number of pre-existing contacts in the banks we&#x27;re trying to sell to. We&#x27;re in a very good position to grow; it&#x27;s back to us on the dev team to increase our feature set to close more deals (almost every customer wants this one little thing...)<p>My point is: for enterprise sales, contacts are everything. If you&#x27;ve got a good product, you should be able to sell yourself to a good sales guy; and you can follow networks from there.<p>However perhaps sales to the financial sector are a different category of sales to the ones the OP is talking about, where large numbers of bodies is more important.",1443264156

10282724,comment,10282523,10282653,0,0,skuhn,,,"memcache operations are mostly constant time, but their behavior is not what I would call deterministic due to the slab allocator. A long running memcached will not behave the same as a fresh memcached because pages are not reclaimed from a particular slab class.<p>Say you have a memcached that has been running and only storing 80 byte objects. The 80 byte slab class has all of the memory pages, and the other slab classes each have one page. Now your key size increases (for instance, because it includes the uid) and your objects fit into the 100 byte slab class. You will only be able to ever store 10,000 of these objects while the rest of your memory allocation is effectively unused.<p>Not an obvious problem to diagnose. You can only fix it by restarting memcached (and losing everything) or (very slowly) migrating pages one at a time to the larger slab class. This anecdote is based on a true story.<p>So your SET operation is still constant time, but the behavior is not deterministic. redis doesn&#x27;t have this type of issue. I wish that I hadn&#x27;t wasted so many years struggling with memcache.",1443263962

A *fair* exchange of *useful* critique",,"Hi dear HN,<p>Shall I create a critique exchange site that is open, free and works well? A place where you give feedback to other people about their designs / web apps / short-stories, for example. And you get back feedback about your own work.<p>The main point is, you would get back roughly as much useful feedback as you gave.<p>Are you interested in this?<p>I&#x27;ve tested many critique/review-my-work services. They tend to make me feel disappointed-in-humanity — the reviews I get tend to be like &quot;this looks great add more images&quot; (when there are many images already). Some sites do work well, but focus on critiquing images only, or have different &quot;problems&quot;, e.g., I have to pay to talk with other users.<p>But why would critique.exchange work well?<p>Because it&#x27;d work like this: If you write a 1 000 characters long and useful review, you&#x27;ll get back useful reviews of a combined length of roughly 1 000 characters. You get &quot;gas&quot; for each character in the critiques you write. You spend that gas to get critique from others.<p>If people fill their reviews will garbage just to get gas — then you click the Unwanted button. Now the reviewer gets no gas.<p>If someone gives you concise feedback that helps you improve your work — then you can click the Like button. This gives the reviewer extra gas (at no cost for you).<p>Another feature is that http://critique.exchange would let you discuss the critique with the reviewer. And other people in the community can join the discussion, and click Like or Wrong on the critique.<p>I&#x27;m not looking to make money from this — instead, I&#x27;m looking to get feedback about the discussion software I&#x27;d use for this, and make that software popular.<p>1) Do you think I should proceed with this idea?<p>2) If you want to be notified about any launch, please send me an email:<p><pre><code>    kaj.magnus.lindberg at gmail dot com

  o X o
  o o o
</code></pre>
This is in an enclosed box with a hole over the center. Here, &quot;o&quot; represents a photodiode and &quot;X&quot; represents the center of the hole. When the solar panel is pointed directly at the sun, the sun is at position X and no photodiode is lit up. As the sun changes position, eventually it will light up one of the photodiodes. That completes a circuit which uses power from the panel to drive a motor, which is attached to a worm gear and rotates the panel towards the sun. Eventually the sun will be pointed at the X position again which breaks the circuit and stops the rotation. Each diode completes a circuit, driving one or both motors (in the case of the corner diodes) rotating them appropriately.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting as well to have some sort of mechanism which, when the panel receives power, keeps it locked in place. When the panel has no power for a period of time (ie: after sunset) the mechanism disengages and the panel falls back to its default position pointing towards sunrise.",1443263519

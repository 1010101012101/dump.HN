This is what people are debating here. The name of the game os ""Elder Scrolls."" Should they be able to block anyone from having a game with either of those two words in the title? It would be like someone making a franchise ""The Dark Knight"" video game getting sued by the makers of ""Alone in the Dark"" because the titles share the word ""Dark."" This is not to mention the fact that no one refers to any of the Elder Scrolls games by the name 'Elder Scrolls.' People call them by the release/episode names (e.g. Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is just referred to as ""Morrowind"" <i>far</i> more frequently than ""Elder Scrolls III"").<p>[edit] Better example: Sid Meier suing Disney over a Pirates of the Caribbean video game infringing on his Pirates![1] game.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Pirates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Pirates</a>!",1317721020

All they need is the million odd developers who use their system for OSS, and they will shake a few bucks out of each somehow. There's no need for them and BB to compete as though they were selling commodity products.

The fact that they aren't taking the original means nothing.  They have broken a social contract with the creator of content that, ironically, they really enjoy and would like to see more of in the future.<p>The problem of someone taking copyrighted content and making it available for others is a small one.  The big problem is the many millions of people who take advantage of it.  If everyone recognized that they're not entitled to anything except their basic human rights, none of which have anything to do with access to MP3s, then others posting that content online wouldn't matter.<p>The hope with this article was a little empathy from a community that often leans toward not caring about copyright law as it pertains to music.  While many chose to go the route of poking tiny holes in parts of the analogy, plenty didn't realize it was an allegory and talked about how messed up it was.  Many of them the same people who fight music copyright tooth and nail.<p>It's just sad to think that everybody enjoys music, just like they enjoy software, and so many other things that can be easily taken, and yet don't care if the people who create it see enough benefit to keep making it for them.  It's short sighted and will result in fewer people having the time to become experts in these crafts, which is a loss for everyone.  Sure, quantity is at an all time high, but in art that hardly matters.",1317718960

As the program ended in 2007, SRI took the knowledge gained by the CALO and some of its key players and formed Siri.""",1317718936

This just sounds like buzzword soup. Maybe you meant something like:<p><pre><code>  with the possibility of the dual-core A5 processor, 1GB
  RAM, iOS integration, cloud performance enhancements, and

Otherwise, I'm just picturing a sleazy salesman pimping an iPhone 5 box with a big 'Now with ""network performance"" included' badge plastered across the front of it.",1317718871

But even if every power plant burned the same gas we put in our cars, switching would still lower emissions because power plants are more efficient than car engines and transporting electricity is more efficient than transporting gas.<p>Hydrogen is a dead end IMHO. Fuel cells are expensive and have many limitations, plus containment and transfer are still unsolved problems. Batteries are improving fast enough now (notwithstanding popular sentiment from people wanting Moore's Law speeds) that hydrogen will never catch up.",1317718832

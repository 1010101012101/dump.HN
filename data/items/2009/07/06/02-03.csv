689046,comment,688934,689009,0,0,mahmud,,,"I tried that with just two kids using PLT Scheme and Javascript. The biggest hurdle is convincing them that software is useful outside the development environment; we wrote apps for the desktop/GUI, console, and MySpace. Kids then tried to customize everything, including system utilities, Open Office, and their own 3rd party games. It was baffling how much they expected from their programming tools; they demanded full integration between compiler and whatever else they were running on their system. They don't understand that some software is extensible (The Dr. Scheme IDE) and others are not (Minesweeper, Bejeweled.), but that was mainly my fault because I did some magic behind the scenes and put their javascript ""commands"" in the firefox toolbar.<p>My nephews kept thinking of functions, operators, and special forms (conditionals and iteration) as ""objects"". They wanted to put ""title"", ""value"" and ""callback"" on the ""wrong"" objects. For example, they could bind a callback to a button and have it popup when it was clicked; they want to attach a similar callback to a block of code and have it fired when the block was executed (a trivial problem to fix; just call your callback from the body of the code block, but they wanted to use call-back syntax.)<p>I am sure they would have loved Squeak, but I didn't have the time to learn it on time; my previous experience with Smalltalk has been brief, mainly with GST and theoretic uses of Self.<p>Kids are a tougher crowd to please than programmers with some ""training"", because children have not yet accepted whatever limitations imposed at us by ""industry"".

689027,comment,688934,688934,0,0,azanar,,,"I had a similar experience when helping a friend with a bug in his code from an introductory programming course at my alma mater. The programming assignment involved manipulation of an array of data in C, and there was a counter variable involved to keep track of which element of the array was currently being manipulated.<p>He understood that there was a relationship between the array and the counter variable, but he took the relationship to far. He thought that the counter variable needed to <i>represent</i> the element of the array, and so he was assigning the value of the particular element in the array to the counter variable. In his mind, the counter variable didn't just provide the element number to look for; it <i>was</i> the element he was looking for, or at least it needed to become so.<p>Both this, and the color example provided by the author, demonstrate how many implied relationships we depend on within the programs we write, and how many people believe that those relationships to be explicitly stated or else the compiler won't <i>understand</i> what we mean.<p>I don't think I was able to get my friend to really understand what was going on and why we couldn't just 'tell' the computer to 'relate' these two things for us. It was a level of such naive concreteness that his mind just fought against descending to. I wonder how someone might educate people in thinking at this level? The optimist in me says it might be possible; the pessimist suggests that it might be in the same realm as trying to get people to understand pointers and recursion, which enough people I've read suggest is extremely hard for some (many?) people to understand.",1246847871

They have to take the course, and so they have to get the book, and so the publisher essentially has a free hand, abetted by the academic bookstores which do quite well off the churn of new books.<p>But this isn't universally applicable. My degree's in philosophy, for example; I still have all the books, and nearly all of them are still in print in the same edition. Most of those have been in their current editions at least as long as I've been alive (fun data point: the teaching guide for one course -- not the text, the <i>teaching guide</i> -- has been in the same edition since the 1970s). The only things which change frequently are topical anthologies, which do need to be updated more often to track recent developments.<p>And anecdotally, I suspect that's a bit more common once you move out of the math/science area of most schools; the number of standard texts which simply aren't amenable to constant churn seems to decrease rapidly as you move over into the liberal arts.",1246846401

I don't know whether these results hold at the world-class researcher level. Still, the school years provide an important foundation for later life, so it is proper that people look into what affects performance.",1246846071

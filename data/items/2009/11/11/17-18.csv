935644,comment,935524,935562,0,0,evgen,,,"> The real question is: Why are we getting vaccines for this flu? It's a lot less deadly than previous seasonal flus. Why the concern?<p>Actually, there is no evidence to support the claim that it is less deadly than previous seasonal flus and several bits of research that suggest it might be a bit more deadly than we thought.  The first pass of this flu early in the year included some really, really bad reporting out of Mexico that at first made it appear to be the second coming of the 1918 flu and then made it look like a very mild flu strain.<p>So far, what we know is that it spreads very quickly because the general population has very few antibodies that can defend against it.  In its current form it is not significantly more deadly than seasonal flu, but its mortality profile is a little different.  It is leading to more pneumonia than most seasonal flus and it is also tending to kill more young people than standard seasonal flu, which usually kills the very young and very old but seldom kills people between those two extremes.<p>Given the rate at which flu mutates (and the possibility that this flu could pick up a particularly nasty mutation) and the lack of any significant herd immunity in the general population it is prudent to prepare for the worst and also to get as many people vaccinated as possible.",1257961936

It only generates the nginx configuration, but I've found it really helpful to setup my multiple sites. Currently, it supports most normal use-cases (like subdomains, specifying log locations, etc.) as well as specific applications like Wordpress, Rails, and Mailman. And of course, extensible.<p>An example configuration file can be found at: <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/146184/config.rb>, just so you can get an idea of how concise it is.<p>- -<p><i>2. Puppet configurations</i><p>I use puppet extensively to manage all my machines and have a ton of configurations which are accompanied by documentation on setup and any miscellaneous gotchas. Although FreeBSD-exclusive, I put a lot of thought into each file and code elegance (using macros, etc.) which might be helpful to others.<p>An example manifest can be found at: <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/146184/mailman.pp>.<p>- -<p><i>3. Blogging platform using Etherpad as a backend</i><p>I love writing in Etherpad. So much, I made an entire blogging platform which is controlled from within Etherpad. You edit configuration, tags on posts, and posts themselves (in Markdown) in Etherpad and everything gets cached locally as static HTML on the backend.<p>An example ""Etherblog"" can be found at <http://annotalia.com>.<p>- - - -<p>My assumption is that (1) would be suitable for github, (2) should go somewhere in the puppet wiki/github, and (3) should be discussed with the Etherpad folks first. But I honestly have no clue where to start and even less of an idea of whether these are valuable enough to bother open-sourcing. I do know that all of this needs to be cleaned up and I am only willing to do the work if someone will benefit.<p>So HN, please lend me your advice on:<p>* If you would find any of these projects personally interesting or useful?<p>* How you would go about open-sourcing the projects? Any good guides out there?<p>* Most importantly, if any of you would be willing to mentor me through the process, I'd really appreciate it. My email is in my profile. Would be great to have someone comment on my code quality and guide me through brainstorming anyone I need to contact, putting something up on github, and publicizing the projects.<p>Sorry for the long post and thank you for your time!\n- Edwin",1257960302

935577,comment,934142,935257,0,0,maw,,,"My main gripe with Python is that it's impossible for autoindenters to work correctly.  Consider this code:<p><pre><code>    if x == foo:\n        # do things\n        if y == bar:\n            # do something\n        # do other stuff <-- at what indent level should this line live?\n    # get on with life\n</code></pre>\nYou and I know what that means given its indentation, but an autoindenter can't know what to do with the fifth line.  It gets worse when you're moving blocks of code into different indent levels.<p>Now, it's true that in this simple case, you could rewrite the snippet starting with:<p><pre><code>    if x == foo and y == bar:\n        # ...\n    # get on with life\n</code></pre>\nbut when blocks get long, this becomes less practical.  And your autoindenter still doesn't know when to stop indenting and get on with life.<p>As a result, in my Python code, I use otherwise gratuitous pass statements all over the place–ugly, but it does the trick.<p><pre><code>    if x == foo:\n        # do things\n        if y == bar:\n            # do something\n            pass\n        # do other stuff <-- at what indent level should this line live?\n        pass\n    # get on with life\n</code></pre>\nMy hypothetical ideal language (the one that's not lispy in outward appearance, anyway) would use braces but would also not run if any inconsistencies of indentation are found.<p>This would be allowed:<p><pre><code>    if x == foo {\n        # stuff\n        # more stuff\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut this would not:<p><pre><code>    if x == foo {\n        # stuff\n       # more stuff <-- BAM!\n    }</code></pre>",1257959888

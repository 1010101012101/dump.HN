Without this running narrative, the article&#x27;s just a list of Google&#x27;s most successful products and its recent acquisitions. Despite your claim, the article isn&#x27;t simply a list. And the editorializing is the only reason this article is on the front page of HN. Period.<p>I realize it&#x27;s just a rhetorical device, but the article reads still like a conspiracy theory. The only thing this article does is, at best, lump critics of Google&#x27;s privacy behavior in with conspiracy nuts.<p>And there&#x27;s no reason to appeal to fantastical &quot;what-if&#x27;s&quot; when there are real, demonstrable problems.<p>> Why can&#x27;t it be both-and vs. either-or?<p>It can be (see below), and I think the notion that I somehow implied Google&#x27;s new expansions cannot be problematic is mostly a fabrication of your indigence.<p>It&#x27;s just that I think the narrative of the article is completely ridiculous and trivializes actual avenues for abuse.<p>What is Google doing to do with military technology? It has 3 options:<p>1. Use it to create technology which augments its other ventures.<p>2. Sell to US Govt or our allies.<p>3. Create a private army or sell to our enemies.<p>2 and 3 don&#x27;t worry me for the same reason I don&#x27;t worry about Boeing taking over the world; military tech is closely monitored and regulated. I don&#x27;t have to know Page&#x27;s motives to know that he knows that if he were try try 3, he&#x27;d probably end up in prison or dead.<p>I don&#x27;t have to be omniscient to assume he probably wouldn&#x27;t take that kind of risk. And hell, I don&#x27;t even need to know anything about him to know that if he did, the US military would be able to easily unilaterally shut him down.<p>Scenario 1 worries me (despite what you&#x27;ve read into my previous comments), but it&#x27;s really just an additional element of the <i>privacy</i> problem.

For every Uber you have 100 Yo&#x27;s. For every Google you have 1000 ad-tech analytics startups that kind of all do the same thing in slightly different ways.<p>We have the opposite view on this: you seem to think that the bulk of what the startup scene does is disruptive, with a few idiotic startups giving the rest a bad name. I believe the balance is in fact the opposite: a few truly disruptive companies and boatloads of &quot;silly little startups like &#x27;Yo&#x27;&quot;.<p>> <i>&quot;Everybody in startup land knows that 99% of them amount to nothing.&quot;</i><p>So... why are the 99% working on things they know will amount to nothing?

These are startups purpose-built for the exit, not for the impact of its products.<p>That is the precise thesis the author is offering: that there are a tiny number of people in our industry working on real, disruptive change, while others try to squeeze easy money out of the system while aggrandizing themselves as innovators.",1405270418

Formal backup planner, dry runs, native support for running as a service with separate engine and UI processes.<p><pre><code>  -- edit --\n</code></pre>\nLet me give an example of what I mean by &quot;much better UI&quot;.<p>Bvckup 2 has a <i>hierarchical</i> log viewer [1] and this thing does an absolute wonder for usability. Essentially you can go from a backup run summary to the specifics of a failure in a matter of 2-3 clicks without being overwhelmed in the process.<p>The issue however is that it was a total bitch to implement so that it wouldn&#x27;t require keeping an entire log in memory at all times. See, if the log is flat, it&#x27;s easy to display its relevant part by looking at the scroll position and then rendering respective chunk from the log file in a window. But once you have a tree, determining which item is <i>visible</i> becomes a hard problem, because random nodes can be opened and closed. Consider the case when you have a million-item log and, say, 15% of the nodes are closed. Moreover, the visibility look-up needs to have a real-time performance, because the window needs to respond in real-time to user dragging scroll button up and down. So, behind the scenes, this hierarchical log viewer is backed by a double-indexed b-tree index file - a construct that that has no prior art and that took me several weeks to converge to and to implement [2]. It could very well pass for a modest PhD thesis in a smaller university :)<p>So, I mean, there are smaller simple-looking differences between bvckup&#x27;s UI and other apps, but the thing is that they are sometimes <i>really</i> hard to implement. They do however improve the overall UI experience quite a bit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bvckup2.com/img/r8/screenshot-3-log-viewer-2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bvckup2.com/img/r8/screenshot-3-log-viewer-2.png</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bvckup2.com/wip/#27012014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bvckup2.com/wip/#27012014</a>",1405270329

8027871,comment,8027662,8027662,4,0,tenfingers,,,"In Italy I had the first programming introduction at 11, using Commodore 64 and the language used for teaching was Logo. Logo had to be loaded from 5&quot; floppy disks.<p>Commodore 64 were already obsolete by the time, in fact at 12 (the next year), we switched to Windows, and we used something to do hypertexts instead.<p>Needless to say, Logo was much more instructive to whatever bullshit we were using the next year (in fact, I don&#x27;t ever remember what I was actually doing during these classes).<p>Our teacher was an Italian teacher, with the usual assumption at the time that programming language = natural language. The switching to hypertexts the next year/s was obvious for them in retrospect, though had little to do with programming at all.<p>At 15 we started &quot;real&quot; programming classes with Turbo Pascal under a dos environment. By that time, I was already programming by myself, so I always found these classes to be boring as hell. I was using the practical classes to program simple video games. Though pascal (and TP in general) was a huge step up compared to other &quot;modern&quot; classes we had in our school that were teaching Visual Basic or Java. Under TP we were actually doing some basic algorithms, while the other guys were left doing some useless GUI. With TP you could inline assembly, switch to graphical mode, and whatnot.<p>The teacher I had this time was a math teacher, which had only minimal CS knowledge. Better than nothing, but still a far cry. The &quot;lessons&quot; were split in two parts:<p>* basic math introduction to some concept (say, &quot;calculate area of triangle&quot;)<p>* applied session of the concept, for example: make a program that computes the area of said triangle<p>Nothing much learned in these classes, if <i>anything</i> actually.<p>I got several 0 marks (which got my math grades from 10/10 down _under_ the sufficiency and required me to _repeat_ the year) for arguing with the teacher about the limits of the machine words (I went with a print-out of a ~10 pages bignum library I wrote just to disprove her). I actually got suspended for asking the school director if I could be an assistant during these classes. I only have shitty memories about these times.<p>Different times, as CS was barely a &quot;science&quot; these days. Though my fear, especially after participating as a _real_ assistant in classes, is that there will be no CS at all, or at least nothing that would actually teach these kids anything.<p>In retrospect, the C64 was the best teaching environment I could ever have. You could understand the whole system (hw&software stack) in relatively little time. No chance you could do something similar with any modern system.",1405270247

People seem to want to attribute sinister motives to Page, and while I don&#x27;t know the man, all available evidence suggests he&#x27;s more ambitious business tycoon than Big Brother-in-training.<p>I do, however, think there&#x27;s something very interesting in this piece. Namely, what does it <i>mean</i> for someone to hold such potential power over the lives of so many? In the grand sweep of history, the amount of theoretical control over the world afforded to someone in Larry Page&#x27;s position has accumulated in the blink of an eye, and it&#x27;s staggering.<p>Technology is changing more quickly than our ability to understand its ethical, socioeconomic, and even existential implications. That doesn&#x27;t mean we have to adopt the Luddite program, to be frightened of technology, and to slow its progress. We should welcome the rapid progress, and encourage technology. At the same time, perhaps we need to get a lot more serious about developing a coherent philosophy of technology, and a forward-looking technology policy. For instance: it&#x27;s still a bit crackpotish to suggest we should be working on a Three Laws of Robotics in 2014, but that notion will become less outlandish in the next few years. And maybe, as Asimov subtly suggested, <i>we&#x27;re</i> the robots who need the guidelines.<p>We live in very interesting times.

For killing a pedestrian, you&#x27;d presumably make it so that killing someone while driving under the influence is presumptively negligent homicide as opposed to something like vehicular manslaughter.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s disingenuous to say there&#x27;s a &quot;near 100% chance of endangering people around you&quot;. That&#x27;s saying that there&#x27;s a 100% chance that you&#x27;ve increased the risk by some amount. There&#x27;s nothing even close to a 100% chance that you will actually do any <i>damage</i> to people around you, or crash. According to [1] there are 112 million self-reported episodes of impaired driving, and 1.4 million arrests, but 10,000 deaths. Obviously these are not hard numbers, but my guess is that driving under the influence likely triples or quadruples an existing (small) risk that you would kill or harm someone. That&#x27;s not a trivial thing, but it would still mean that in the vast majority of cases, if you drive under the influence, everyone gets home safe.<p>And in any case, <i>I&#x27;m not in favor of people driving under the influence</i>. Similarly I don&#x27;t think people should drive while tired (it&#x27;s a similar rate of impairment), but the simple fact is that these crimes <i>by themselves</i> don&#x27;t have victims, they are just occasionally the cause of actions which <i>do</i> have victims. You can certainly make the case that drunk driving should be against the law for any number of reasons, but that&#x27;s a separate issue as to whether that crime actually has a victim.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/MotorVehicleSafety/Impaired_Driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/MotorVehicleSafety/Impaired_Driving/impai...</a>",1405267483

Muscle burns calories, but people with more muscle also tend to eat more calories. This is even true of people who have extraordinary quantities of muscle.<p>Cardio, on the other hand, only works that way up to a point. People who do a bit of running also tend to compensate by eating more. However, after a certain level of volume, cardio starts to suppress the appetite to about what&#x27;s needed to maintain the workload.

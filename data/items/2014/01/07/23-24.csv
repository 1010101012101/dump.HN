7020853,comment,7016153,7020257,2,0,gsnedders,,,"> Wishful thinking? Where are these reference implementations documented for HTML 2.0, 3.2, 4.01?<p>There is no requirement for them to be &quot;reference implementations&quot;. CSS 2.1, for example, used various web browsers as proof of interoperability (where every test in the test suite was shown to have at least two passing implementations). The &quot;interoperable implementations&quot; clause was introduced as a recommendation in 1999, 2001 saw it required every feature in the spec must have been implemented, preferably with two interoperable implementations, and clarified as RFC2119 &quot;should&quot; in 2003 — HTML 4 was published in 1998, prior the W3C having a formal process document, and HTML 4.01 was likely exempted as a minor revision in 1999.<p>> If the spec is lacking, whatever the reference implementation does completes the spec. There is no value in having a pure paper spec that someone may be able to implement a correct piece of software with over having a correct reference implementation with full source code.<p>Ideally the spec shouldn&#x27;t be lacking. If one needs a reference implementation, the spec has failed to be a complete definition, and if the spec is not a complete definition, what is the point of it? You may as well just have a high-level overview in the documentation of the reference implementation!",1389138992

I use xmonad on my Linux box (arch), and most of my friends use awesome/ion3/openbox/xfce/etc.<p>I agree with your assessment that everything being in the browser now is probably amongst the primary causes for it. As a developer, everything I do is either in a terminal or in a browser; and tiling managers are just much better and efficient for that user persona. And if you&#x27;re a nerd but still want to use a floating wm (why would you!?), then there&#x27;s almost no reason to use Gnome/KDE over a more lightweight alternative.<p>The users who (debatably) benefit from non-tiling WMs (the computer using grandpa, but also designers, 3D modelers, engineers who work using CAD programs, accountants, etc. etc. etc.) are all on Windows/OSX anyway, with little reason to move to Linux ever (and when they do use Linux, for example to process bigdata®, they do so over SSH on EC2 anyway).<p>So what&#x27;s the future for Gnome/KDE? Obviously they&#x27;ll always be there for people who are first discovering Linux and need something familiar to navigate around; but I doubt they&#x27;ll ever have the popularity they had in the early 2000s.<p>I for one am looking forward to a year 2030 where nerds still use tiling window managers and &quot;ugly&quot; terminals :)<p>Addendum: I guess SteamOS could sway a lot of gamers towards Linux; and that uses Gnome.

7020839,comment,7019673,7020519,11,0,yonran,,,"You’re right, there are disadvantages to a single codebase and builds at trunk. You pick up regressions, and it is difficult for your team to develop on its own while holding everything else constant.<p>But I don’t think the speed of receiving fixes is the essence of, or even primarily the source of, all my headaches with versions. The problem with mixing and matching versions within an organization is the enormous <i>complexity</i> that it introduces. Perhaps your downstream coworkers are still using an old version of your project, so they don’t want you to refactor their use of your API. Or perhaps you forgot to update your required upstream dependency when using a new function from a library, and your coworker’s program crashed because they’re still using the old dependency. Or perhaps someone forgot to bump the major version number when changing API or behavior, causing a previously built downstream project that is linking against the new upstream project to crash.<p>Now, these problems are all solvable if you and your coworkers are very disciplined in updating your version numbers and your required dependency versions. But it means that you constantly have to be aware of what APIs you export and what versions of APIs you are calling. You constantly have to edit the project manifests to bump version numbers. You must think about whether your changes will be major or minor. You carefully read the Changelist before using the newest upstream projects. It is a mental burden.<p>Contrast this to a monolithic codebase and build system. There are no version numbers in the dependency manifests to other projects in the company. If you want to change an API, you are responsible for fixing all the downstream users (rather than the other way around).  Making a new project adds little mental overhead. If there is no impedance mismatch between the different teams of your company, it can make life much easier.",1389138763

Whenever you make a blocking call, all of the async stuff happens under the hood, so that you just deal with sequential code.<p>Erlang&#x27;s concurrency model deals with lots of lightweight processes. Rather than having callbacks it uses a message system. Whenever a process waits for a message it yields so other processes can be executed.<p>In your example there would be a process separate from the main[0] process that handles the database connection. When you request the update to the database, you are just sending a message to the database connection process. This will receive the message and handle the update when it can[1], and once complete, send you a message back with the result of the update. During the waiting period the VM will continue executing other processes. No callbacks needed :)<p>[0] Erlang concurrency is based upon the actor model. There isn&#x27;t really a main process, but for the sake of explanation...<p>[1] The database connection process will actually block while making the update, so if you have 10,000 processes calling this, you will have a bottleneck.

The Russians have made tons of movies about the war with fascist Germany (and its aftermath because it did not really end on VE day) and there was a lot of torture used by both the Soviets and the Nazis. But it was often ineffective in that the victims either died without saying anything or they misled their torturers resulting in serious loss to the enemy who believed the info received from torture. And the folks who had real good info knew that they would be tortured, and when they realized that they were about to be captured, they either committed suicide or shouted to their friends to be shot to death.<p>In other words, anyone who follows the truth of torture use during a historical conflict will realize that it does not work well.<p>In fact, what worked better was to trick the person into revealing info. These were often set up as complex double and triple bluffs because the folks in charge knew that their prisoner would try to trick them back and therefore they had to outsmart the prisoner. In one case, the Nazis did a complex bluff where they booked up all the port time at three French ports, and all the rail shipping slots between France and Germany. They had two goals. To get a Soviet spy ring to report back with encoded messages containing the names of the three ports so that they could get a foothold in cracking their cipher, and convincing the English (and Soviets) that an invasion was imminent so that they would waste efforts. In fact the plan was to move additional forces to the Eastern front.<p>In that case the Soviet spies outfoxed the Germans when they learned that all the trains were empty and therefore did not  report the port names in code. And this warned the Soviets of a German push coming up in the next few weeks so they were better prepared.<p>There are a lot of fascinating stories from the Eastern Front waiting for someone to take the trouble to overdub them in English.",1389136727

So, if you want to launch into an equatorial orbit from Vandenberg, you have to have the rocket initially head south, over water, and then turn.  This wastes a lot of fuel, and it&#x27;s not something anyone wants to do if they can avoid it.<p>So, the SpaceX Manifest lists only two launches from Vandenberg in 2014 --- and one of them is the Falcon Heavy demo flight, for which no payload has yet been announced.<p>Manifest here: <a href""http://www.spacex.com/mission"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.spacex.com/missions</a>",1389135666

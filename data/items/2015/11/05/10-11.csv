10512681,comment,10512096,10512096,0,0,amelius,,,"> It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable neurons to recognize multiple patterns. In this paper we extend this idea by showing that a neuron with several thousand synapses arranged along active dendrites can learn to accurately and robustly recognize hundreds of unique patterns of cellular activity, even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation.<p>I didn&#x27;t RTA, and I&#x27;m clearly no expert, but what surprises me here is that a single neuron can apparently &quot;learn&quot; patterns. I was previously under the impression that only networks-of-neurons could learn patterns (as in artificial neural networks). Does this mean that the ANN community should rethink their mimetic approach?",1446721086

The Guix System Distribution or GuixSD is an advanced distribution of the GNU system that relies on GNU Guix and respects the user&#x27;s freedom.<p>> In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management, per-user profiles, and garbage collection. Guix uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix package manager, except that packages are defined as native Guile modules, using extensions to the Scheme language. GuixSD offers a declarative approach to operating system configuration management, and is highly customizable and hackable.<p>You might also find this little poster helpful:\n<a href=""http://elephly.net/downies/poster-v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elephly.net/downies/poster-v3.pdf</a>",1446720688

That means that you need to store every bit of energy that isn&#x27;t immediately used, because it will be needed later.<p>Back in the real world you wouldn&#x27;t design your system that way.  Instead, you would look at your worst case scenario - mid-winter, and calculate how many solar panels you would need to capture a day&#x27;s worth of energy in one day.  This would also tell you how large your battery would need to be.

For me, it merely replaces XMPP/IRC: group-chat.

Me, I come from a simple, integrated IRC and XMPP client. Now we all use Slack and I have a poor experience compared to the Just Works[tm] chat (through empathy) on Ubuntu.<p>* Slack crashes 2, 3 times per week. Mostly memory issues. Empathy never crashed on me, that I can remember.<p>* Empathy is, AFAIK always on. I switch off Slack when not working because (1) it abuses resources and (2) it addds another icon to my toolbar (empathy integrates in Ubuntu&#x27;s message icon).<p>* Empathy starts whenever I start my OS. Slack can be configured to do so. But when it does, its slow startup time and CPU-gobbling while starting makes my desktop appear sluggish.<p>I&#x27;m comparing it to a well integrated, thin and snappy XMPP client, which is what Slack replaces for me.

But that&#x27;s mostly orthogonal to his manner of expression.<p>The overflow checking functions are very compelling for unsigned multiplication and all of the signed operations. It makes sense for unsigned addition and subtraction if it&#x27;s already an existing pattern for the difficult cases, but I don&#x27;t think it was a good way to introduce the functions. These are definitely the most optimized way to perform the checks across the board though, especially for multiplication. Linus is just making incorrect assumptions based on his lack of faith in compilers.",1446717913

Given time for your eyes to adapt you can apparently see quite clearly, and it&#x27;s also apparently looks just as weird looking as it sounds (never tried it myself).<p>The trouble is it&#x27;s rather dangerous. Your iris will be wide, wide open because your eyes think it&#x27;s dark. Any, e.g., sun glare from reflective spots will be focusing an awful lot of heat onto your retina. And you need sunlight to produce a bright enough image to see... so it&#x27;s not something you want to do without great care, or you&#x27;re risking blindness.<p>Reference: <a href=""http://amasci.com/amateur/irgoggl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amasci.com/amateur/irgoggl.html</a><p>Just, if you&#x27;re trying this, be really cautious.",1446717839

The etcd watch API, from reading the article, doesn&#x27;t reply until an event occurs, so if an event never occurs in time (before a whole bunch more requests come in), it won&#x27;t do anything with the socket, and thus won&#x27;t find out the other end closed it.",1446717825

If you have a duration of one day, and haven&#x27;t stored when this day starts, you don&#x27;t know how many seconds in that day.<p>The particular problems of leap seconds are two: first, they are easily forgotten - leading to incorrect calculations. Second (heh!), since insertion of leap seconds is not regular, you need updates to keep your time arithmetics correct.<p>---<p>Now it might surprise you that I&#x27;d personally think leap seconds are cool, and we should keep them. However, it&#x27;s hard to explain to someone faced with these problems <i>why</i> a few seconds of offset in sunrise time is such a big deal.",1446717749

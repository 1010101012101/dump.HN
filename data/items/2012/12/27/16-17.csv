'binstubs' will now be checked into source control. If I use MRI and you use JRuby, they'll start with different things, and therefore, cause conflict.<p>2. Many of the Ruby version switchers work with '#!/usr/bin/env ruby', but rbenv won't in certain circumstances, so an optimization for it has been built into the framework now.<p>David maintains that if I use MRI and you use JRuby, or if I use rvm and you use rbenv, this is an 'organizational failure.'",1356627588

Am I correct in interpreting that thread as DHH not wanting to support multiple ruby package managers in the rails codebase?

The problem is selling specifics as general truth which is what he does in large parts of his post. I'm not wearing leather trousers while posting this, despite being a mere 200 km from the Weisswurstquator.<p>Btw: The point about a larger market is an interesting notion, but don't forget that you might just as well sell to canadians, middle and south america and you'd have a larger, even more unified market. That's exactly where the european diversity matters: It's hard to sell to france as a german startup and they other way round.

Sure, sharing a pic with one's friends raises the risk of someone sharing it on Twitter, but that is super simple to do. Right click, Save Image As..., Upload, Browse, OK.

Take out ""Save Image As..."", perhaps if a ""private"" attribute is set on the image.<p>* Make Facebook technology display more clearly what is the audience of a given item. Yeah, that means spelling in clear if the image is available for advertisers as well.<p>Given this little two steps, ""accidentally"" posting a private image to Twitter becomes less of an excuse.

To test how interviews goes I have applied a few of them and went to interview. Interviews usually goes like that, rate your X programming language knowledge from 0 to 10 and they write down what you say. They have very shallow knowledge (mostly just the name of technology) about technologies and they cannot question you to verify your rating is realistic or not. \nI am working at a SW House and we are nearly 1000 developers here so there are always a few interviews nearly every week. Sometimes I ask managers to join interviews to ask technical questions and gave feedback about the guy's technical knowledge. They hired candidates which I gave positive feedback and also candidates which I gave negative feedback. After six months when I talked with managers they were very pleased about the performance of the guys which I gave positive feedback. \nSo I decided to leave from my company to found a recruitment agency.

As someone else has mentioned, it's actually really convenient compared to getting my phone out of my pocket, but mostly I like the way it looks -- I guess it's a form of functional jewelry.<p>I think watches are also status markers. Witness the wide variety of vastly overpriced -- for the actual functionality you get -- watches on the market.

This works by not showing his comments to others, which in return means that the user will not get any conversations going or any upvotes and pretty soon he'll start thinking that the others are ignoring him completely, which is in general a good incentive for someone to leave a community.<p>The problem with hell-banning is that for users that post a lot of comments, they'll soon realize that they are hell-banned and trolls (in particular) can only be stopped if they are genuinely ignored.<p>For this reason, if you want to stop trolls, slow-banning could be a good alternative by making usage of the site unpleasant.

His point about German startups was true at one time, and is no longer true, but his larger point about legal requirements for the workplace being strict in Europe and essentially non-existent in America is true.  His contrast of personal liability for entrepreneurs in Europe with the essential absence of any such liability in America is true.<p>His post is not directed towards Europeans.  It is directed towards American entrepreneurs who are looking at Europe - and could <i>come</i> to Europe with vastly incorrect assumptions about what it means to start and run a business here.<p>Along the way, sure, he makes some pretty generalized points about business in Europe that may be less than accurate.  The ""no new valuable businesses"" point is a little off and to my mind not even the point.  But what he is actually saying is that, should you want to start a startup in Europe as an American, here are some things you should know in advance, and here are some reasons you might want to do it despite a risk profile that is entirely different.<p>The diversity of Europe doesn't even matter in this context, except as a reason Americans might like to live here.<p>And OP's point that the income diversity between Scandinavia and Russia is <i>really</i> beside the point.  The point is that the European middle class is healthier than the American middle class, and if you can steer around the problem that they speak fifty different languages, you've actually got a bigger market for consumer goods and services here than in the States - and that's a weird and unusual thought that I, personally, found quite inspiring.",1356626612

Even just walking around a gym should show you that primarily you have 3 types of equipment, cardio, weight machines, and free weights, so it isnt as though there is simply too much to learn and understand for somebody whose job it is to be knowledgeable.<p>The issue with many personal trainers (and people you discuss fitness with in general) is that, for the most part, if your diet is good, doing pretty much anything in the gym will get you results.  Many trainers have desirable figures and they know it and they constantly have people asking them for advice in their private lives and are paid to give it at their jobs.  This causes many to simply assume that what they did is the ""correct"" way to workout when the truth is that had they dont most any routine with that devotion for many years, they would have gotten similar results.<p>This is much more similar to investing in the sense that the experts often give worse recommendations than you could find yourself with a few hours research.

With free weights, I need a spotter and it's much trickier.  (2)  Perhaps more important:  If I'm doing heavy legs (450 lbs, for example), with free weights I have to load a lot of weight on my back for a squat.  This is dangerous even for younger men (I'm 50 years old) because  slight distraction and they can hurt their backs in a way that is really hard to get over.

For me, a watch is too low-tech compared to all the things I surround myself with (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air, etc.). All it can do is tell time?<p>I've been longing for a bluetooth (or similar) watch that had deep iPhone integration, looked stylish, and wasn't too expensive. The ones I've been able to find can't match all three.<p>I'd love:<p>* tell me what song is playing, allow me to change tracks<p>* show me the text message I just received<p>* show me who is calling me, with a button to ignore / send canned response<p>That said, I always thought the watch market was pretty small.

I don't shy from a gun; I hunt and target shoot using my family and friends' guns. I just don't own any due to not having a reasonable case for owning one in my current living situation (I have roommates).<p>What purpose would that map serve? The only thing I can think of is your easily-offended neighbors would avoid you and your house. Good. If you're going to get up in arms (so to speak) about private and legal gun ownership and knowing that I own a gun is going to change your opinion of me for the worse, I'd like to know that before I invest significant time into building a relationship with you as my neighbor. If you're going to assume I'm a criminal just because I own a gun, I want nothing to do with you. Another benefit I could see from this type of map is a convenient listing of addresses that burglars may tend to shy away from. No one wants to rob a house and find a gun in their face if there is a house right next door without weaponry.<p>Do I want this information presented in this way? Not particularly. There's not much benefit to the average person in knowing where legally registered guns are kept, and potentially negative consequences if the neighborhood kids now know that your house has guns they could get a hold of.<p>I strongly disagree with the intentions of the journalists in this case, and applaud the lawyer for his response in a vigilante justice sort of way.",1356624377

When I moved from Rails to Node.js, the focus on small libraries held together by an exceptional package manager was a huge breath of fresh air.<p>If anything, Rails poisons things in the Ruby community because the monolithic approach of the biggest framework in the community simply works against small libraries with small interfaces that are very compatible and remixable.<p>In fact, one of the best developments in the Ruby community lately has been the increase of other frameworks like grape, padrino, rack, sinatra, etc. I know some of these have been around for a long time, but it wasn't until Rails started getting long in the tooth that they started getting more and more attention.",1356624167

I would agree with them because intellectual ""property"" qua property is bogus. The essential nature of what is claimed as property by IP law: patterns, ideas, techniques is that they are not scarce goods versus things like your body or your car.<p>How should we define ""legal productivity""? I think that it should be measured by making victims whole and CMU was not deprived of anything by Marvell using the same pattern. The focus on arbitrary jail time and fines paid to government versus restoring victims is one thing which needs to be rebooted.<p>Another is the tragedy of the commons situation with free and open access to courts. This creates a long queue for trials and simply drawing out a case which has no merit is used as a weapon itself. If justice was a service being paid for and we implement a loser-pays doctrine, as has always been the case in common law, we wouldn't see a lot of these patent cases, besides the fact that IP cannot exist without a state to grant the monopoly.",1356624109

4973694,comment,4973383,4973620,27,0,malandrew,,,"Exactly my thoughts. For example, I know for certain that Jos Valim is (or at least was last time I checked) a core ruby dev and he's against this change for example. DHH wants to sound like he's talking to trolls and the casual Rails user, but it's clear from the github thread that he's responding to seasoned members of the community as well, which quite frankly is a pretty shitty way to treat people who are known contributors. It's not a community, it's whoever screams loudest. To me that thread and this posts shows that DHH is willingly wearing horse blinders instead of keeping his opinions being open to being amended through thoughtful discussion with others as talented as he is.<p>The biggest problem with this ""omakase"" attitude is that it's causing Rails developers to miss the boat on many new developments in the state of the art in web app development because legacy is now baked in via opinion. 37Signals hasn't been the forefront of web-app design for a few years now. There are plenty of single page web apps out there that are far more responsible and present a better user experience than tools from 37Signals. Don't get me wrong, they are still decent, but they aren't demonstrative of what is achievable insofar as excellent user experiences are concerned.<p>Maybe this has changed, but I spent a year working on a single page webapp built on Rails and the asset pipeline was excruciatingly painful to debug to get your javascript and other assets handled properly.",1356624026

8821989,comment,8821722,8821722,0,0,olalonde,,,"I have never used Snapchat so I might be off here but if I understand correctly, its main distinguishing feature is the ephemeral nature of content shared with it.<p>I find the concept of imposing artificial constraints on apps/interactions fascinating. Twitter was arguably the one to popularise the idea with its 140 character limit (perhaps by accident, the limit was initially there to support SMS) and now Snapchat (ephemeral posts). Are there any other apps that play on this theme?<p>Makes me wonder if there are other apps out there waiting to be &quot;constrained&quot;. Here&#x27;s some dumb ideas off the top of my head. What about a social network where you can only have 10 friends? What about an email inbox where you are limited to receiving X emails/hour (perhaps senders could bid on delivery priority?). What about a HN where you are only allowed to comment once a week? What about a continuous delivery system where you are blocked from releasing after you reach a quota of defects (I heard Google uses such a quota system internally)? What about a package repository which rejects packages with over 150 lines of code or some other quality metrics?",1420080927

(Because on day 1 of her week, she could have written it properly.)  That does not make it technical debt of 1 day.  It means it didn&#x27;t actually exist.<p>Maybe this is really a variation of the sunk cost fallacy or something similar, where if something seems to exist in some form, then people can&#x27;t get their minds around the fact htat only 20 minutes of it actually exists and the rest simply doesn&#x27;t and needs to be written if they want it to.<p>EDIT: all these downvoters are wrong.  You say &quot;now you have both wasted time&quot; but the 20 minutes wasn&#x27;t debt.  It was the cost of the call option.  For example in the other poster&#x27;s example where a salesperson sold some code that didn&#x27;t exist, his non-programming version of it wasn&#x27;t debt toward the final thing: it was the cost he paid for the call option of being able to sell the whole thing.

For example, it used to be that you were liable for stolen credit card misuse until the time it was reported. The law changed to limit your liability, which placed more emphasis on the bank to do fraud detection.<p>The parallel here is obvious; if as a matter of principle they decided to assume 100% liability, then this gives them inventive to improve fraud detection, which can be done through things like usage analysis. While assuming no liability gives them less inventive to go after fraud. If Amazon wants happy customers, then great service helps - no principle needed.<p>(In addition, the US government requires additional reporting and oversight of your bank account. For example, the bank can be in trouble if they decline to notice a pattern of structuring your transactions to be under the $10,000 reporting limit to the government.)",1420080587

They simply see everything through the lens of their extremist faith.  I think they are nuts but I respect their approach.<p>For example, they often do have telephones. Many villages have <i>one</i> phone in a phone booth in the middle of the town.  So everyone can see you use it.  You can&#x27;t hang out and impersonally communicate -- instead you stop by and visit in person.  But if they need an ambulance, or to do a business deal with someone outside their community, they can.<p>They also will use some power tools, though they don&#x27;t want them to be electric.  I don&#x27;t quite understand the reasoning, but whatever.  Apparently there was a lot of experimentation, and not everybody chose the same solution.<p>They also let their teen agers leave the community and get drunk crash cars etc.  Amazingly to me a majority decide to go back into the fold.  Every adult has made a conscious choice to be observant.<p>In a small way many of use use the same process (though hopefully from a different starting point and with different parameters).  I love my MBP but the app I run most is Emacs.  I know what an IDE is but don&#x27;t see the point.  I laugh when I see reviews of iOS apps that are described as &quot;visually stunning&quot; -- typically they have a low information density and slow interface, which makes them unpleasant to me.

I remember Facebook desertion not being much more than a statistic even a year ago, now it&#x27;s pretty common to encounter people that don&#x27;t have an account there anymore. I think that the bandwagon effect that is behind the growth of online communities is a double-edged sword; once the trend shifts to users leaving, the more they leave the more users are likely to leave later and everyone snowballs out until there is no one left. Fortunately for Facebook, many of those peers left because of WhatsApp/Instagram, so business&#x27; still in the family... for now, albeit much less profitable. Sooner than later, FB will be gone and its place will have to be filled up by something else. Snapchat has a seat reserved in the post-FB era and apparently that is worth at least $20B.<p>Anyway, derailing the discussion a little, I&#x27;d like to hear what you&#x27;d think if &#x27;Core Facebook&#x27; went out of business right now (but not WhatsApp/Instagram).

In the technical debt case, the ongoing cost is opportunity cost - the initial quick hack may make it harder to evolve the code, or you may have to spend time fixing bugs instead of adding features.<p>As with financial debt, if that ongoing cost doesn&#x27;t matter - because the payoff outweighs the compounded ongoing cost, or because you can offset the ongoing cost with other sources of cash flow / bandwidth - then taking the debt was the right call.<p>If you abandon the project (declare bankruptcy) then you never have to pay off the debt :)<p>If you &quot;make it big&quot;, though, someone eventually will <i>want</i> to pay it off.  Either you make it big by becoming a successful business, in which case your time horizon extends, and at some point the interest payments compound enough that you don&#x27;t want to pay them any more.  Or you sell to someone else, in which case they have the same problem, and (if they&#x27;re smart) they should have paid you less because you sold them a liability along with an asset.<p>[1] Most financial debt has a maturity date, so eventually you <i>do</i> have to pay it back, although not if your lender is willing to indefinitely roll over.

Then in 2012 after Facebook&#x27;s hugely publicized botched IPO and Nasdaq error, all the experts again said the web 2.0 bubble had burst; the stock price and earnings have since doubled. Unlike the big blowups of Friendster, Myspace, Digg, etc..these post-2008 web 2.0 valuations have proven to be extremely sticky. Pinterest, Twitter, Dropbox, Air B&B, Tinder, Snapchat, Whatsapp, Uber, Instagram...all keep going up with no end in sight, year after year until either IPO (which finally creates volatility) or buyout. There&#x27;s hardly any big failures or blowups, except perhaps Zynga and Groupon (although it&#x27;s still worth $5 billion). My prediction is these web 2.0 valuations will keep rising for many years to come because that is the path of least resistance, and the investor demand and user growth for these companies is seemingly unquenchable. The unending web 2.0 boom and unending wrong predictions about its demise show how these &#x27;obvious&#x27; parallels to the old tech bubble of 1995-2000 are just so wrong. There&#x27;s more at play here, such as the investor flight to quality (more money chasing fewer companies), huge user growth, huge monetization potential from smartphone engagement, the very large millennial population that use these services, and ability of these web 2.0 companies to carve out niche dominance and then keep it. Within the next year or two, we&#x27;re probably going to see Uber being worth $100 billion before IPO, Snaphat $50 billion, Tinder $10 billion, Air B&B $50 billion, etc. Take every valuation and quadruple it. Back in the 90&#x27;s, $100 million was a big deal; now that&#x27;s just a rounding error or the equity of just a single early employee. Insane, but very prosperous times we&#x27;re living in.

It could be that the userbase of Snapchat is especially important (being young trendsetters) rather than the mass of users joining because all their friends are there.<p>Second, when Facebook bought WhatsApp, it wasn&#x27;t for monetization but for taking a threat off the market. WhatsApp and Facebook compete for the time of the same users; I don&#x27;t think you could ever put the actual financial value of WhatsApp at $20b; but it could very well interfere with the plans of your $100b+ business which goes after the time and networking effect of the same users.<p>I feel like at this point Snapchat and Facebook are playing chicken. This will end up as an acquisition deal. Snapchat could never monetize to warrant that valuation, while Facebook would pay a lot of money to, again, win the engagement of these users slipping away from its platform. 
There aren&#x27;t too many ways Snapchat could translate its paper value into cash: only an IPO (not a chance, they&#x27;re not IPO material) or an acquisition by Google, Microsoft or Facebook (others aren&#x27;t big enough for placing this bet, and Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to care enough about services to make such an acquisition, especially with the slightly shady element of the Snapchat concept).<p>So Snapchat and its investors will come together to push the value higher and higher until one of the tech giants break and buys the thing.

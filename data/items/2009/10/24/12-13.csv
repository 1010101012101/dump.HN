This is reassuring to Joe Average, because he knows that he isn't going to see any code he can't understand.</i><p>That's the intention, but the reality is quite different. When smart people really need to write more abstract code in a weak language they will go to great lengths, including on the fly byte code manipulation and all kinds of weird proxying hacks. Or look what they do with CSS.<p>So, the abstractions are always possible, albeit in a way that is even more complex and definitely more brittle than if they had been implemented in a more powerful language.",1256387497

They're 100% seeded with public funds (from the Regional, National & European levels). They incubate software, web but also electronics, green tech and life sciences projects.\nThey're not run by faculty or students but by a dedicated team with professional and entrepreneurial experience.<p>Now, to be honest, I'd probably say they have had mild success so far. I know it's far from being a true indicator of “success” in this field but for example, they haven't incubated a company anyone would know about outside of the local start-up scene. But they've been at it for 9 years and they're still growing. They offer real workspaces in a handful of offices they operate around the Paris area.<p>If you have any questions about them, I can try to answer or put you in touch with the team.",1256386779

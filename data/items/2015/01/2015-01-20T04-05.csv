I&#x27;m not against people carving out a cultural niche, but I think that the point we can use the word <i>isolation</i> to describe it, we have a problem.  The problem isn&#x27;t one direction, either.

8915512,comment,8914678,8915445,0,0,firebones,,,"There are a couple of things going on here.<p>First, when you&#x27;re young, your life experiences in the world are less varied, so you can fail to appreciate many of the more subtle interactions in those works which you pick up on when you&#x27;re older. That&#x27;s why the classics offer so much re-readability. You&#x27;re a different person each time you read them, and bring different perceptions and knowledge to bear.  It&#x27;s also why fantasy and science fiction has broader appeal, especially when you&#x27;re younger--the real-world experience matters less, and it is the creation of these worlds that sets much of that background context that you&#x27;re missing at those ages.<p>Second and similarly, the more you read, the better reader you become.  This applies to artistic media like movies too.  I remember the difference between my ability to follow the plot in movies as a kid versus as a young adult versus as an adult.  Subtext and complications not appreciated at a young age become much more apparent the more &quot;good&quot; stuff you watch.<p>Take something like &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. I saw this when it first came out and focused mostly on the acting and the events unfolding, but didn&#x27;t really get into the motivations and missed a couple of the implications.  Watching it again more recently, a whole new level opened up. I wanted to share it with my high school kid to broaden his horizons a bit, but I realized that even those plot points I took away the first time would require explanation because he doesn&#x27;t really have enough experience inferring implied motivation of characters.<p>It seems like the &quot;classics&quot; become classics because they are written to appeal to all of these levels and can be revisited many times.  Perhaps introducing these at a young age simply gets that first exposure out of the way, even if all the subtext is lost.",1421728762

The language has been changing so fast that most of the stuff on the Web is outdated or wrong. I just found a place in the official reference manual that&#x27;s out of sync with the compiler, and sent in a note.  (The lambda/closure syntax is still in a state of flux.)<p>Rust roughly follows C/C++/Java syntax, except that, like Go, it&#x27;s a &quot;name: type&quot; language. Talking about ownership in code is new, as is the syntax for that.  The ownership syntax is a bolt-on, and it shows.  The lambda syntax is kind of weird; the designers went for conciseness over clarity.  Some of this will take getting used to.  The syntax is no worse than C++, and in some areas, better.<p>The syntax isn&#x27;t the hard part, anyway. It&#x27;s living within the ownership restrictions that&#x27;s hard.  It&#x27;s hard because that&#x27;s a design issue.  There&#x27;s a Rust port of Doom, and it has far too much unsafe code, because Doom&#x27;s data structures were not designed with Rust in mind.  It&#x27;s not yet clear how big an issue this will be. The remark that 10% of Servo, the web page renderer, is unsafe code is a bad sign.<p>I don&#x27;t have a personal opinion on this yet. I haven&#x27;t written enough Rust code. I&#x27;m writing an RSS feed parser to get a sense of what it&#x27;s like to deal with a complex tree in Rust.  So far, it&#x27;s going well, with no need for unsafe code.<p>If Rust can eliminate buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory leaks, that&#x27;s enough to justify using it in place of C/C++.",1421727617

Is a life lived while watched as free as one in private? Are you willing to argue that a man influenced by the panopticon is just as free under that influence? A life spent avoiding shame, embarrassment and condemnation is an oppressed life if you ask me. It is also a society which will subdue creative and divergent thinking, in turn slowing scientific and cultural progress.

An educational system which enforces strong conformity and strict rules performs well on paper but fails to produce as much innovative thinking.<p>Just one novel example I came up with while examining PISA  scores recently.

Trying the same method leads to an integral you cannot solve in elementary functions (for many definitions of &quot;elementary&quot;). These integrals are called elliptic integrals [1]. They satisfy many relationships, one of which is what is algebraically called an elliptic curve.<p>Trying to gain insight into these integrals, people generalized them to a larger class of similar integrals, which can be thought of as functions mapping complex numbers to complex numbers, that satisfy certain periodicity relationships. They all are defined on a parallelogram, and then the values are repeated over the entire plane. This parallelogram can be cut out, and edges glued together suitably to form a torus (doughnut), which has one hole, called &quot;genus 1&quot; in many areas of mathematics. A sphere, which has no holes, is genus 0.<p>A general way to study these is the Weierstrass elliptic functions [2], which are inverses of this mapping. These functions satisfy a relationship which (under a suitable class of isomorphism) is the equation y=x(x-1)(x-a), which got the name elliptic curve [3].<p>Another (connected reason) is there is a way to define the genus of a curve in algebraic geometry, which over the complex numbers relates to the surfaces and holes idea above, but this definition can be defined over any field (reals, rational, finite fields like those used in crypto, infinite fields of finite characteristic, and probably many more structures besides fields).<p>Using this definition of genus, lines and quadratics turn out to be genus 0. Curves of the form y=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c) have genus 1, which is already called elliptic in the complex number case so this is another way to think of them.<p>In grad school my math PhD thesis used elliptic curves, so I know a little of the math, but less of the history. I can try to explain more if people want.<p>Next, do you want to hear why fire engines are red?

8915412,comment,8914678,8914678,0,0,jasim,,,"It&#x27;s not that you expect anything in particular from this particular book. You&#x27;re the sort of person who, on principle, no longer expects anything of anything. There are plenty, younger than you or less young, who live in the expectation of extraordinary experiences: from books, from people, from journeys, from events, from what tomorrow has in store. But not you. You know that the best you can expect is to avoid the worst. This is the conclusion you have reached, in your personal life and also in general matters, even international affairs.<p>What about books? Well, precisely because you have denied it in every other field, you believe you may still grant yourself legitimately this youthful pleasure of expectation in a carefully circumscribed area like the field of books, where you can be lucky or unlucky, but the risk of disappointment isn&#x27;t serious.<p>So, then, you noticed in a newspaper that &quot;If on a Winter&#x27;s Night a Traveler&quot; had appeared, the new book by Italo Calvino, who hadn&#x27;t published for several years. You went to the bookshop and bought the volume. Good for you.<p>In the shop window you have promptly identified the cover with the title you were looking for. Following this visual trail, you have forced your way through the shop past the thick barricade of Books You Haven&#x27;t Read, which were frowning at you from the tables and shelves, trying to cow you. But you know you must never allow yourself to be awed, that among them there extend for acres and acres the Books You Needn&#x27;t Read, the Books Made For Purposes Other Than Reading, Books Read Even Before You Open Them Since They Belong To The Category Of Books Read Before Being Written. And thus you pass the outer girdle of ramparts, but then you are attacked by the infantry of the Books That If You Had More Than One Life You Would Certainly Also Read But Unfortunately Your Days Are Numbered. With a rapid maneuver you bypass them and move into the phalanxes of the Books You Mean To Read But There Are Others You Must Read First, the Books Too Expensive Now And You&#x27;ll Wait Till They&#x27;re Remaindered, the Books ditto When They Come Out In Paperback, Books You Can Borrow From Somebody, Books That Everybody&#x27;s Read So It&#x27;s As If You Had Read Them, Too. Eluding these assaults, you come up beneath the towers of the fortress, where other troops are holding out:
the Books You&#x27;ve Been Planning To Read For Ages,
the Books You&#x27;ve Been Hunting For Years Without Success,
the Books Dealing With Something You&#x27;re Working On At The Moment,
the Books You Want To Own So They&#x27;ll Be Handy Just In Case,
the Books You Could Put Aside Maybe To Read This Summer,
the Books You Need To Go With Other Books On Your Shelves,
the Books That Fill You With Sudden, Inexplicable Curiosity, Not Easily Justified.<p>Now you have been able to reduce the countless embattled troops to an array that is, to be sure, very large but still calculable in a finite number; but this relative relief is then undermined by the ambush of the Books Read Long Ago Which It&#x27;s Now Time To Reread and the Books You&#x27;ve Always Pretended To Have Read And Now It&#x27;s Time To Sit Down And Really Read Them.<p>With a zigzag dash you shake them off and leap straight into the citadel of the New Books Whose Author Or Subject Appeals To You. Even inside this stronghold you can make some breaches in the ranks of the defenders, dividing them into New Books By Authors Or On Subjects Not New (for you or in general) and New Books By Authors Or On Subjects Completely Unknown (at least to you), and defining the attraction they have for you on the basis of your desires and needs for the new and the not new (for the new you seek in the not new and for the not new you seek in the new).<p>All this simply means that, having rapidly glanced over the titles of the volumes displayed in the bookshop, you have turned toward a stack of If on a Winter&#x27;s Night a Traveler fresh off the press, you have grasped a copy, and you have carried it to the cashier so that your right to own it can be established.<p>-- If on a Winters Night a Traveller, Italo Calvino.",1421726411

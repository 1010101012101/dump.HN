At the time Bulldozer was being developed, multi-core systems were just being introduced to the consumer market. It was unclear what sort of architecture would be most performant. AMD made a (bad only in hindsight) bet that Bulldozer would be a viable architecture for general purpose compute loads. It turns out that combining 1 FPU with two integer pipelines is not as effective as an SMT architecture.<p>At the time Bulldozer was developed and released, what exactly constituted a core was still not precisely defined. It turns out that Intel&#x27;s SMT architecture is much more effective, and thanks to market- and mind-share, people associate the definition of a core with Intel&#x27;s specific implementation.<p>AMD&#x27;s new development is on an SMT architecture known as Zen.

Light &quot;fills&quot; a material by polarizing the electrons inside the material. However that polarization can and must re-emit light. If there&#x27;s a 1:1 ratio between the amount of polarization you get in the material for field in the light the reverse process is equally likely, then it turns out the material polarization will always just make light again in the same amount as you add. Ie: there is a hole in the bucket and you cannot fill it.<p>Some materials polarize non-linearly. Ie: you add 1 drop of water into the bucket and it becomes two drops inside or the reverse. Actually all materials do this but much less than ordinary (linear) polarization. The author&#x27;s contrived some setup which would exploit this effect to keep the polarization in a nanostructure. Something like (and this is an abuse of analogy): one drop in bucket, it splits, one of those is emmitted and one kept etc. The operating principle of such a device is to control the paths the drops travel on, and separate the directions to enhance the desired processes. Something like a mouse trap.<p>There are many devices which already exist and maintain states of light given some energy input, for example LASER cavities.  Non-linear phenomena are well understood and exploited in all sorts of fascinating optical devices. Non-linear processes are usually weak and rare, so seeing them requires intense light which is expensive to generate and can burn weak materials. Preparing nanostructures which have the desired nonlinearities could be hard or impossible.<p>For example it&#x27;s easy to theoretically imagine a crystal that would take the many of infrared photons emitted by the heat of your hand, and upconvert them into fewer visible photons you could see. However any material which could be polarized so much by those low energy photons would not be stable at room temperature so no such thing exists...",1447857489

You still have the fundamental problem that you can&#x27;t select <i>what</i> you collapse, so you still have to send a conventional signal to &quot;decode&quot; the putative instantaneous signal.<p>Remember the correspondence principle will still be in play; future quantum theories will still have to limit out to what we know today, because the QM of today is arguably the most rigorously tested theory in humanity&#x27;s history, by number of significant digits. FTL communication still will have all of the problems conventional relativity says it will, for all the same reasons.<p>Entanglement has suggested for a long time that there may (in clumsy English words) be some sort of &quot;real reality&quot; that isn&#x27;t necessarily constrained by what we think of as space and time. In fact even relativity looked at in a certain manner has suggested this; you can travel from any point in the universe to any other, barring black holes, along null spacetime intervals. Null spacetime intervals have no distinction between the points in them, because they all come out the same 0 in the metric measurement. I wouldn&#x27;t expect that any of this new math is going to change anything; it may explain where the constraints of space and time come from, but explaining the constraints doesn&#x27;t mean that the explanation will come with a way to get around them!<p>In fact my personal observation is that the fundamental limits of space and time have been getting stronger as we learn more about physics, not weaker; a mathematically rigorous derivation of the fundamental speed-of-light limit from a &quot;more fundamental&quot; level of reality locks the door even tighter, it doesn&#x27;t open it.",1447857183

Let&#x27;s say that a product has an additional capability which 90% of the market doesn&#x27;t need, but required significant research to accomplish.  It&#x27;s a soft-capability, so there&#x27;s nothing additional that you need to manufacture to enable it.  You have a couple of options - you can make two different models (essentially identical underneath, except for the cheaper one disabling the extra capability), but this is inefficient.  You can of course have one product, one price.  But this is also less than perfect, as you have everyone paying for a feature 10% want, and you can be outcompeted at a cheaper price for the basic product.  Another option would be to DRM the product and soft-enable the feature for the 10% who want it, at a higher price.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch, but it&#x27;s plausible in some situations.",1447856434

We all started taking college classes early, my older sister correspondence at 14, my twin and I correspondence at 15.  All of us took classes at local colleges before starting &#x27;real college&#x27;.  All of us scored high on our ACTs, all of us got scholarships to college.<p>My parents didn&#x27;t really push us, we were just smart.  We had childhoods, I was a starter on the basketball team, and played college soccer for a year.  I also read 10+ books a week, played way, way too much Civilization and Total Annihilation,  and did plenty of volunteer work, especially at our local public access station.<p>For my sisters, going to and living at &#x27;real college&#x27; worked out well, they both succeeded in their own ways (my older sister graduated with two masters a few days after she turned 21, my twin sister received a lot of recognition from professionals in her field before graduating, was salutatorian, etc), whereas I didn&#x27;t do so well being away from home and the support structure.  I&#x27;m lazy, and I thought could just not do assignments I didn&#x27;t want to and do well enough on other assignments to make up for it.  Long story short, my GPA dropped enough to lose my scholarship, and I decided that the private college experience wasn&#x27;t worth borrowing tens of thousands of dollars for.<p>So I moved home, finished my bachelors from the state university in town.

But holy texts are rife with ambiguous and contradictory paragraphs, as explained in the article -- you can find an equivalent of &quot;You Shall Not Kill&quot; and in a different verse &quot;Kill The Infidel&quot;, and you need some Wise Man to explain to you &quot;ok, you shall not kill believers, but you can kill the unbeliever, unless there is a full moon (as mentioned in verse XYZ), in which case you can only kill goats&quot;. But this is the Wise Man&#x27;s interpretation; by definition there is no single valid &quot;literal&quot; interpretation. And once you accept there is <i>some</i> degree of interpretation at play, you can no longer claim ISIS is evidence that Islam is fundamentally more blood-thirsty and terrorism-prone than other religions; just that some of the current high profile terrorist organizations are using their reading of the Quoran to justify their actions, and that they claim their interpretation is the &quot;purest&quot;.<p>Even within ISIS and Al-Qaeda there is doctrinal dispute, as evidenced in this other article from The Atlantic, &quot;What ISIS really wants&quot; ( <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isi...</a> ), which shows fundamentalist clerics disagree, and this creates splits. How can this be, if all of them believe they are following &quot;pure, unadulterated Islam&quot;?",1447856186

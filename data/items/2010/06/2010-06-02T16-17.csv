Because it looks like the application itself isn't doing much at all (receive message over socket, touch some memory) you're probably better off with a simple thread pool and some lock free data structures if you're really going for raw performance. On the other hand, it does serve as another data point that a Java solution can be fast enough.<p>Anyway, I think that thinking in terms of ""message throughput"" is really harmful. The author starts with a throughput of 120.000 messages per second and ends up with 800.000 messages per second which gives the advertised 6 times speedup. But essentially at 120.000 messages per second you have a ""process overhead"" of a mere 0.008 milliseconds. That's 8 microseconds. Microsecond!<p>I'll just repeat that. Overhead of 0.008 milliseconds per message in the SLOW case. So if you want to write the message to file, or do any kind of hash table lookup or want to do any kind of back end processing, whether you have 0.008 milliseconds or 0.002 milliseconds overhead per message is not going to be that big of a deal.",1275497725

The real issues on Symbian weren't different models/screen sizes (hell, S60 phones had more or less standardized feature sets). It was the lack of any real control over the platform itself. As a developer you had to constantly deal with functional side-effects changing (and Symbians lack of coherent architecture, design, and quality meant there are a LOT of functional side-effects).<p>So the situation is definitely not Apple-to-Apple's.

1398389,comment,1397583,1397583,0,0,bdickason,,,"I posted this on your blog but it seems that you are checking this more regularly so I'll post it here:<p>The reason people (myself included) click Pricing is because they want to know what they’re getting themselves into before starting a free trial. I suspect that if you added the pricing clearly on the homepage, the # of clicks on your ‘free trial’ button would increase and pricing would decrease dramatically.<p>This is covered in the book ‘Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion’ where the author describes a man refusing a flower from a little girl because he’s “on to her game.” The idea being that people have become conditioned NOT to accept free things without understanding the ramifications of signing up – “What if I like it? What happens then? Do I have to pay $600?”<p>I have noticed this affecting my signups for web apps lately. For example, ZenDesk looks great but the 30 day trial won’t help my company in its infancy. I would love to use a ‘free single user’ version and would gladly pay eventually, but I click pricing and see that after my 30 day trial expires, I’m stuck paying much more than I’m comfortable with. So I haven’t signed up yet. Again, GetSatisfaction is similar. I would like to use their service but before clicking ‘Signup’ I click Pricing to see what I’m getting myself into. What happens if I get hooked? Am I going to be out $200/month?<p>This is the question I asked myself with your software and your pricing is reasonable. I will definitely sign up when my company launches our product.",1275495588

Don't make apps that do what Apple devices can already do natively. They made an app that was too much like a desktop and got rejected. That seems entirely reasonable.",1275494855

1) People downvote trolling and negative/witty comments
2) The interface gets out of your way
3) It updates constantly
4) The content is exactly what I'm looking for... and exactly what I couldn't find anywhere else
5) People are genuinely here to help. I am eagerly anticipating launching my startup so I can post an ""Ask HN: Review my launch"" here!<p>Ok I wanted it to be 'three things I like' but it turned into 5 :) Thanks to Paul and the community!",1275494836

1398308,comment,1397591,1398277,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"> AT&T said that 98% of its customers will save money by switching to these plans.<p>When trying to overcome debt, many financial advisors recommend paying off the smallest debt first, even if it has relatively lower interest than other debts. This is because the psychological win of paying off an entire debt quickly has a much bigger impact upon the ability of people to stick with their payments, rather than the mathematically better path of paying down a higher-interest debt first.<p>So yes, people may be saving money. But that doesn't mean that it's necessarily better. I'd rather pay an extra $5/mo or whatever for the peace of mind.<p>> And, AT&T doesn't have the capacity to handle many people who would exceed these limits.<p>As a consumer, I don't care what AT&T has the capacity to do. They're supposed to figure out how to serve me and give me what I want. It's obviously possible, as they were doing it before, and other companies still have unlimited bandwidth plans. Innovate or die. But I guess I'm expecting too much out of the telecom industry...",1275494477

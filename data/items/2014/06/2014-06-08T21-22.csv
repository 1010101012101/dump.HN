Scientific method should not be take lightly.<p>The walls of the ivory tower of science collapsed when bureaucrats realized that there were jobs to be had and money to be made in the administration and promotion of science. Governments began making big investments just prior to World War II...<p>Science was going to determine the balance of power in the postwar world. Governments went into the science business big time.<p>Scientists became administrators of programs that had a mission. Probably the most important scientific development of the twentieth century is that economics replaced curiosity as the driving force behind research...<p>James Buchanan noted thirty years ago - and he is still correct - that as a rule, there is no vested interest in seeing a fair evaluation of a public scientific issue..&quot;<p>-From Kary Mullis, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner (and the genius inventor of PCR) in an excellent essay in his book &quot;Dancing Naked in the Mind Field&quot;.",1402264722

I don&#x27;t think anyone has a clear definition of this, and in reality it&#x27;s all just a philosophical quagmire.\nAn important distinction is whether mimicry is equivalent to &quot;true&quot; intelligence, or whether it should be treated as such, barring a better litmus test. With that in mind, taking a methodologically agnostic perspective of adequately reproducing behavior that is predicated as intelligence seems like a much more reasonable goal to me.",1402264717
7866051,comment,7865024,7865948,2,0,astrobe_,,,"I think the programmers among us are infected by the use of punctuation marks as part of the syntax. Many programming languages just hijack punctuations marks: C&#x27;s field.selector is plain silly when you think about it and about the fact that the colon was available; and now something less natural than the period must be used to separate statements. As for Haskell, I find that the ML family is IMO quite remarkable for its tradition of terrible syntax choices (again, why x:xs when x,xs was an option? And that convention of putting commas at the beginning of a line!?).<p>It seems to me that arguing about what a comma means when put in this or that place is symptomatic of this programmer mindset. Natural languages are ambiguous, redundant and sometimes inconsistent by non-design. And so is their punctuation. Nobody understand punctuation, especially programmers.",1402264659

It&#x27;s also mostly an encoder optimization, and thus doesn&#x27;t have much influence on the standard.<p>What&#x27;s more interesting is adding special tools to the bitstream to represent things like text, which do not compress well with typical block transforms.

7866040,comment,7863902,7865544,2,0,BugBrother,,,"OK, some more specifics...<p>For the strange opinions you just don&#x27;t find -- e.g. conspiracy theories about all the West media being after Russia, which are only written in Putin&#x27;s controlled media.<p>Then there were claims about Ukrainian right wing extremists (which got really few votes in the last election) and other strange things you only see in Putin&#x27;s media.<p>Arguments were often just not relevant for Sweden. Like &quot;but what about USA in Iraq&quot; -- that only works in USA (and maybe Britain), if that. Even the Swedes that condemn the Iraq invasion, not so few, of course have no problems <i>ALSO</i> condemning that Russia starts to treat Europe like Hitler in the 1930s; military threats, destabilisation, annexations etc.<p>The Russians avoids all questions about where they were writing from and none claimed to <i>not</i> be Russian. If it was proved where they came from (e.g. logs from the proxies they use, or something), it would automatically be news in Sweden.<p>Then we have the obvious bad Swedish, the first month a lot seemed to be from Google Translate. The bad voting scraping (one comment posted a bit down in a comment tree -- 10-15 top votes in seconds; never happened otherwise).<p>I also posted a couple of links here <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865214"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865214</a><p>And so on...<p>Edit: And about a state&#x27;s trolling/astroturfing being high quality: First, note the low quality of conspiracy theories from Putin&#x27;s junta. The personal envoy of Putin, Sergej Markov, yesterday claimed that Sweden, Poland, Finland and the Baltics had Russophobia -- and threatened with a new World War if the countries joined NATO!! And other crazy stuff. That was worse than before 1991 -- and note that it wasn&#x27;t for internal consumption by Russians only reading Putin&#x27;s media! Also, see that about starting with Google Translate. There are lots of quite small languages in Western Europe. How do you to a reasonable cost quickly find enough people that know Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, etc, etc? Then you have to train them (or give them stuff to translate and post).<p>Edit 2: I hope the above is readable. Ask otherwise, I might have the energy to continue.<p>Edit 3: The <i>main</i> difference compared to spam is that spam has much less resources, it is much less work intensive. There are maybe one message per 100K receivers. With astroturfing in the end, most (probably not all) comments will be at least partly written individually. If the same comment is posted in many places, e.g. something like Disqus can detect them directly (or Google, for that matter).",1402264359
7866039,comment,7865914,7865968,29,0,worldvoyageur,,,"I grew up on a farm in southern Ontario where, according to the article, little monarch breeding takes place.<p>Among many features of the farm was pasture thick with milkweed.  We did not interfere with it.  As a kid, it was trivial during the summer to find monarch caterpillars.  Normally, we&#x27;d bring one or two into the house each year, put them in a jar that we&#x27;d refresh daily with milkweed and watch the process of the caterpillar growing, entering a chrysalis and emerging as a monarch butterfly.<p>Twenty five years later, when my city kids were the right age, I eagerly took them out to the pasture to find monarch caterpillars.  The pasture was just as thick with milkweed as I remembered, but where is was once easy to find monarch caterpillars, year after year there were none to be found.  Only one year were we able to find any.<p>I too mourn the decline of the monarch butterfly, but whatever the cause, it can&#x27;t be a mere 20% decline in milkweed population.  My parents&#x27; farm still has the capacity to support the hundreds of monarchs it once did, yet as far as I can tell they are gone.",1402264350

So long as people are willing to pay almost anything and have access to the money to do so, prices will continue to rise. In my opinion, the &quot;spiral&quot; is largely the fault of excess government subsidization and price insensitivity. College is sold as a magic ticket into the upper class, and most people simply will never question this assumption.<p>Ending the flood of government money will force people to actually question the value of education and, as many people are priced out of the market, will hopefully lead to a rise in more efficient means of education like apprenticeships and cc.<p>That said, the article MASSIVELY distorts the extent of the spiral because it focuses on sticker price and not on net price. Evidently, the author doesn&#x27;t realize that sticker prices are so high because colleges price discriminate. Very few people pay anything close to the listed price for college. For public colleges, the average net price is one third of the list price. For privates, the percentage is higher, but that&#x27;s just because wealthy people are overrepresented at private colleges. Even then, the average net price isn&#x27;t even close to the list price.<p>For example, I attend an &quot;elite&quot; private school. Although the sticker price at most of these schools is between $60,000 and $70,000 a year, massive grants are given to students that mitigate most if not all of the cost. I come from a family with slightly above-average income (but still decidedly middle class) and get a $50,000 grant from my school. I have a friend who is also middle class who is being given a full ride.<p>So, although this article makes a few fair points, it ignores the root of the problem and fundamentally misinterprets the data.",1402262296

For example we can trivially turn a Python expression &quot;a + b&quot; into a Javascript expression &quot;a + b&quot; to get a great speed benefit. It may even give correct results in benchmarks, but in general it breaks the semantics and therefore any frameworks which rely on it.<p>FYI in Python &quot;a + b&quot; is equivalent to &quot;a.__add__(b)&quot;, and hence the correct Javascript would look more like &quot;a.__add__(b)&quot;, but this requires a property lookup and a function call so a lot of the speed gains may be lost (although some benefits may be regained by JITting).<p>Considering that the parent pointed out how small this project&#x27;s codebase is, it does give legitimate concern about how many rules there are for mapping Python&#x27;s semantics to Javascript&#x27;s. For example, the ShedSkin project has been around for years and gets very impressive benchmark results since it compiles Python to C++; however, it tries to map Python classes directly to C++ classes, which breaks the semantics immensely.",1402262016

7865924,comment,7864765,7865247,2,0,mwfunk,,,"I think the graphics stack is a sore point on most or all platforms that have to support multiple GPUs from multiple vendors, at least the stuff in between userland GL calls and the bare metal.<p>In an ideal world it would be obvious where to draw the line between the GPU- and vendor-independent bits and the common code shared by everyone, but not only is that very hard to do, it can change drastically over the years. Couple that with the fact that platform vendors have to maintain these imperfect interfaces for many years regardless, and that vendors can have their own abstraction layers in between the top layer of their driver code and the bare metal of all their GPUs, and you have a perfect storm of too many layers getting in the way and imperfectly defined interfaces to many of those layers, which necessitates occasional layering violations at every level of the stack if you want to avoid some pathological performance bottlenecks for some GPUs.<p>At best you end up with a bunch of ugly, imperfect, but generally functional software that more or less gets the job done at an acceptable level of performance.<p>I would imagine that the situation with Linux just adds yet more issues to that bag of hurt. GPU vendors don&#x27;t always want to help out, and are likely to withhold valuable technical information that they don&#x27;t want to be public. The whole process of defining how many layers there are, what functionality exists at what layer, and what interfaces are used between the layers is almost by definition (for GPU driver models at least) a bunch of questions for which there are no good answers, which is also a perfect storm for Open Source development. Any solution anyone comes up with is always going to have some caveats and gotchas, which for open, egalitarian development models means endless arguments and bikeshedding in which everyone involved is correct in pointing out the weaknesses of the system as designed, but there are no alternatives that anyone can point to that don&#x27;t have similar problems in someone else&#x27;s eyes.<p>For example, back in the &#x27;90s, for right or wrong I was very optimistic about GGI solving a lot of graphics problems for Linux, and that was limited to the 2D stuff (I can&#x27;t imagine how controversial it would&#x27;ve been had it included 3D as well):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Graphics_Interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Graphics_Interface</a><p>It didn&#x27;t pan out that way, but so much energy was burned by so many people arguing about it over so many years. :( I don&#x27;t have authoritative knowledge of the whole thing, so maybe the doubters were correct, but at the time it felt like a bunch of people shooting down an imperfect solution while offering no solution at all.<p>EDIT: TL;DR designing a graphics stack that ultimately goes down to the metal is a set of very hard problems, many of which have no perfect answers. This, coupled with secretive vendors and the level of specialized knowledge required to even contribute to stuff like this, makes it an even harder problem in the Open Source world. Not an insurmountable obstacle, but a really hard set of problems nonetheless, for both technical and human reasons.",1402261932

Meanwhile, yes, putting shiny metal things into their mouths is essentially the full time job of a toddler.<p>The problem isn't that magnets are inherently unsafe, or even that tiny round magnets are unsafe. It's that <i>this particular packaging</i> of tiny round magnets is unsafe.<p>There's a lot of really fun things a conscientious person can do with fire, electricity, strong acid, or liquid nitrogen.

4740815,comment,4739951,4740622,6,0,tedivm,,,"I should probably point out that I'm a little obsessed with them- I have a few hundred Buckyballs (various colors and stuff), as well as a couple thousand of the Zenmagnets. The big differences really come in when you're trying to make something delicate or with a larger structure.<p>One major issue is consistency- the sizes between colors or even individual balls in the same set varies quite a bit. If you create a flat plane (one height, whatever length and width) or magnets with both the Zenmagnets and the Buckyballs, the Zenmagnets will be level all around while the Buckyballs have different sized. This causes some to bulge out, making that level plane actually quiet bumpy looking.<p>The other problem is that the coating they use over the actual neodymium is very cheap. The longer you own the Buckyballs the more of it breaks off. The Zenmagnets are going to last quite a bit longer, and not break down in your hands just because you let them snap together too hard.",1352059057

4740803,comment,4740378,4740726,4,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I have the real world experience and I stand by my position. It does suck and I can empathize and of course I can understand why you'd pirate the software but are you really going to try to tell me that it's not wrong? Can you honestly say that not paying is okay because the price is too high and you don't agree with the reasons why you can't run your dongle on a new OS? That's what it comes down to in the end. It's about not wanting to pay and disagreeing with the price. The fact that you know the dongle should work on your machine doesn't put you in a position to <i>know</i> why they want you to upgrade. Anyone in that situation would have a knee-jerk reaction and jump to thinking its a corporate conspiracy and they're just gouging people. That's plausible. Or maybe there's a legit reason that you don't know. But in either case, no matter how ridiculous the experience is (and I grant you that the example you provide is very unreasonable) it still doesn't change the fact that someone created something of value to you, you want to use it above all alternatives, and you choose to pirate it which is wrong.<p>Suppose I go to the Apple store and I want a new MacBook Air. I have to wait in line for an hour. Then when I get into the store they've upped the price by $10k. Then, even after swallowing my frustration, I look to pay but all the checkout guys are busy. So I decide this is fucked up and just walk out with it. You'd agree that was a messed up situation but it's not okay for me to walk out of a store without paying.<p>The point is something I can't fathom anyone disagreeing with. There's a product. It has a price. If you want it you have to buy it. If you take it without paying <i>that is wrong</i>. How can you disagree with that?",1352058860

4740784,comment,4740281,4740281,16,0,tokenadult,,,"AFTER EDIT: Thanks to all who have replied for the interesting comments. I discovered this link while digesting replies I received on three different email lists to a request to name experts on mathematically precocious young people. (That was for work.) Tanya Khovanova, the author of the blog post submitted here, was one name suggested to me as an expert on precocious mathematics learners. When I saw her personal website,<p><a href=""http://www.tanyakhovanova.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tanyakhovanova.com/</a><p>I remembered that I had seen her blog post ""Should You Date a Mathematician?""<p><a href=""http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=319"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=319</a><p>posted to Hacker News (and other sites I read) before. I'll read more of her more purely mathematical blog posts over the next few days. I see one I can use right away in the local classes I teach to elementary-age learners.<p>On the substance of the post, I'm seeing several comments that equate ""genius"" to ""person with a high IQ score."" That was indeed the old-fashioned way that Lewis Terman (1877 to 1956) labeled a person with a high IQ score as he developed the Stanford-Binet IQ test. But as Terman gained more experience, especially with the subjects in his own longitudinal study of Americans identified in childhood by high IQ scores, he didn't equate high IQ to genius, and he became more aware of the shortcomings of IQ tests. Terman and his co-author Maude Merrill wrote in 1937,<p>""There are, however, certain characteristics of age scores with which the reader should be familiar. For one thing, it is necessary to bear in mind that the true mental age as we have used it refers to the mental age on a particular intelligence test. A subject's mental age in this sense may not coincide with the age score he would make in tests of musical ability, mechanical ability, social adjustment, etc. A subject has, strictly speaking, a number of mental ages; we are here concerned only with that which depends on the abilities tested by the new Stanford-Binet scales.""<p>Terman, Lewis & Merrill, Maude (1937). Measuring Intelligence: A Guide to the Administration of the New Revised Stanford-Binet Tests of Intelligence. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. p. 25. That is why the later authors Kenneth Hopkins and Julian Stanley (founder of the Study of Exceptional Talent) suggested that is better to regard IQ tests as tests of ""scholastic aptitude"" rather than of intelligence. They wrote<p>""Most authorities feel that current intelligence tests are more aptly described as 'scholastic aptitude' tests because they are so highly related to academic performance, although current use suggests that the term intelligence test is going to be with us for some time. This reservation is based not on the opinion that intelligence tests do not reflect intelligence but on the belief that there are other kinds of intelligence that are not reflected in current tests; the term intelligence is too inclusive.""<p>Hopkins, Kenneth D. & Stanley, Julian C. (1981). Educational and Psychological Measurement and Evaluation. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. p. 364.<p>So on the one hand there is the acknowledged issue among experts on IQ testing that IQ scores don't tell the whole story of a test subject's mental ability. A less well known issue is the degree to which error in estimation increases in IQ scores as IQ scores are found to be above the norming sample mean. Terman and Merrill wrote,<p>""The reader should not lose sight of the fact that a test with even a high reliability yields scores which have an appreciable probable error. The probable error in terms of mental age is of course larger with older than with young children because of the increasing spread of mental age as we go from younger to older groups. For this reason it has been customary to express the P.E. [probable error] of a Binet score in terms of I.Q., since the spread of Binet I.Q.'s is fairly constant from age to age. However, when our correlation arrays [between Form L and Form M] were plotted for separate age groups they were all discovered to be distinctly fan-shaped. Figure 3 is typical of the arrays at every age level.<p>""From Figure 3 [not shown here on HN, alas] it becomes clear that the probable error of an I.Q. score is not a constant amount, but a variable which increases as I.Q. increases. It has frequently been noted in the literature that gifted subjects show greater I.Q. fluctuation than do clinical cases with low I.Q.'s . . . . we now see that this trend is inherent in the I.Q. technique itself, and might have been predicted on logical grounds.""<p>Terman, Lewis & Merrill, Maude (1937).

4740777,comment,4739951,4739951,31,0,tptacek,,,"Zucker is being a little misleading about this. His firm did indeed have a long relationship with the CPSC, and throughout that relationship, no matter what their firm did to mitigate the risks their magnets had to children, reports of life threatening injuries not only continued but <i>increased</i>. The CPSC didn't kill their product for sport; they acted based on the empirical evidence.<p>You'd wonder, reading this article, what problem CPSC had with a simple magnetic toy set. After all, nowhere in this article do the words ""surgery"" or ""intestinal perforation"" occur. The problem is simple. A child can swallow a penny, or even a nail(!), and the ER doctors will send them home to wait for it to pass. But if you happen to swallow two tiny rare earth magnets, what can happen is that they latch together on opposing sides of loops of small intestine, gradually digging their way through the tissue and spilling gut bacteria into the abdominal cavity, which results in sepsis.<p><i>""[W]hen these high-powered magnets are swallowed, endoscopic or surgical intervention is required in nearly all cases to prevent bowel damage."" - Nerissa S. Bauer, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor Indiana University School of Medicine</i><p>Skateboarding is probably statistically more dangerous than tiny rare earth magnets. But parents know how to mitigate the risks of skateboarding. My guess is that 80% of the parents on Hacker News don't even know that swallowing a tiny smooth round magnet is more dangerous to a toddler than swallowing a nail. Certainly teenagers don't understand this, because they were using Buckyball magnets to hold fake lip piercing studs.<p>Zucker's firm attempted to address the problem with warning labels. But how do you put warning labels on a set of 100 tiny metal balls? Even if the label read ""DO NOT EVER LEAVE THESE OUT OF THE BOX"", which they don't and can't because keeping them out of the box is a big part of the point of the toy, what good is that going to do when a teenager buys a set and leaves it on his desk in the house he shares with a 4 year old? Because that is not an uncommon scenario.<p>In the end, the issue here is not that the government thinks it should be unlawful to sell small rare earth magnets. It's that the government thinks companies shouldn't be able to profit from selling them as direct-to-consumer toys and novelty items. If CSPC is seeing marked increases in injuries due to magnets now, when the products are in their early-adopter infancy (there are, according to Zen Magnets, only two companies selling sets like this as consumer products), the CPSC can reasonably assume that the damage would be much worse as the products mainstreamed.<p>Buy the magnets online, or from a lab supply store, and give them the respect they deserve.",1352058506

But instead of providing tax revenues, this tax is extremely expensive to enforce and provides no revenues. Under this perspective, the current system is pretty much unjustifiable.

Of course education should be important, but it can also go too far.<p>I've been in Singapore for 1 year as an exchange student. While I managed to cope well, many slightly less talented students suffer from the great workload and have almost no free time. In a middle class secondary school, about 95% of the children need tuition to keep up with school. Weeks or even months before their exams, all free time is eliminated and dedicated to studying.<p>The learning itself isn't perfect either. It's heavily focused on memorization and involves no oral participation. Foreign languages are almost never taught; math and natural sciences matter the most. Competition is promoted instead of teamwork (not only amongst students, but also amongst teachers and civil servants in general). The teachers are ranked according to their students' results, which does work as a motivator, but discourages them to explain any background information or topics that are not required from exams.<p>Parents urge their children to get the best degree they can in order to be able to take up the best paying job they can find.

This is such a lame justification for piracy. If the author truly <i>wants</i> to pay for it then he will. Saying you want to pay for it in an attempt to seem on the up and up and really <i>wanting</i> to pay for something are different. I can understand the frustration and I can empathize and I can get on board with the idea that the process they put you through to buy Office is ridiculous but I can't buy the justification for piracy. Just because you sell software yourself for a living doesmt put you in a position to decide when it's okay to pirate software. The author may consider the way in which he sells his software to be superior and therefore it's not okay to pirate what he sells but when it comes to someone else's well that's a different story. But its a slippery slope. Microsoft's process certainly is ludicrous but it's not long before people start saying ""you want me to enter an email address to buy software? Oh, that's too much, I think I'll just pirate it, thanks"".<p>Calling it one's and zeros doesn't justify it either. I hate the ones and zeros argument. You're not paying for one's and zeros. You're paying for the value the software creates for you. It may only need to be coded and compiled once but does that mean that after the first person gets value from it that the software has been paid for? Of course not.<p>If someone creates software and you value what it can do then you are obligated to pay for it if that's what the creator asks. Argue about the definition of stealing till your blue in the face but it doesn't change the fact that you are depriving the author of revenue they would otherwise have gotten. It is stealing and to say otherwise is to do some impressive mental gymnastics.<p>The system may suck but piracy isn't going to solve the problem. It's just going to create more problems. Using Office without a license doesn't hurt Microsoft. What hurts them is a more popular alternative. The only thing that will change what the author complains about is someone else creating some half decent office replacement in a way that shows Microsoft how to do it right. If such a program existed and were widely adopted you'd better believe they'd take notice and shape up. Piracy hurts people. It doesn't hurt the big guys though and we know it so we all tend to justify it. But that same attitude that gets people thinking its okay to pirate Office allows people to justify pirating software from smaller companies and that's who it hurts.<p>I see no justification for piracy.",1352057365

But the idea that they need to ""flow into each other"", I just don't buy. I mean, I've never seen anyone (in a real-life use case) resize their browser window to be narrow on their desktop, and iPads deal quite well with desktop-sized sites (especially navigating in horizontal mode).<p>The problem I have with fluidly ""responsive design"" is that it drastically overcomplicates everything. Good design becomes a lot harder, because you can't really keep in your head all the possible variations. A/B testing is drastically overcomplicated, because maybe something works in large width, doesn't work in 3/4 width, works again in 1/2 width, and doesn't work again in 1/4 width, because of the way elements pop around. And it just severly limits the kind of layout you can do. And like I said previously, for what? People don't really use ""in-between"" sizes, at least not that I've seen.<p>To me, ""responsive design"" just seems like a clever theoretical idea, without any real-life benefits. When I make a mobile version of a site, it's usually <i>drastically</i> different from the desktop site -- because it's organized vertically, because there's less that can be shown at once, because mobile users often have a completely different set of use cases than desktop users. It's a completely different beast.<p>In the vast majority of cases, I think it's impossible to shoehorn a truly good desktop experience and a truly good mobile experience together into a single ""responsive design"".

It was a profitable status-quo.""</i><p>That is <i>exactly</i> the Innovator's Dilemma. That is why, IBM, for example didn't pursue the home PC market with more vigor. The status quo is enormously profitable. The emerging market is quite a bit less profitable. However, by the time you recognize that the emerging market has greater growth potential than the status quo, all of the first mover advantages are taken by companies who had no choice <i>but</i> to go into the emerging market. Going back to the IBM PC analogy, Microsoft and Compaq had no choice but to go into personal computers, because the mini-computer and mainframe markets were dominated by companies like Unisys, IBM, DEC, and Digital.<p>In the same way, Apple saw that the personal computer market was dominated by Microsoft. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the company's marketshare had declined precipitously and it had ceded all but a few specialized niches to Microsoft. A lesser CEO would have waged a costly and futile battle to take back the personal computer market from Microsoft. But Steve Jobs saw that the battle was already lost. Instead, he focused on consolidating Apple's hold on the niches that it did retain (high-end, well designed, hardware sold at a premium price) while expanding out into emerging markets like MP3 players, phones, and tablets; markets that Microsoft did not take seriously precisely because its dominance of the desktop/laptop market was so complete.

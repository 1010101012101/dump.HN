As a FB user from early (summer 2004), I can attest to how much it has impacted college.<p>Almost everyone I know is on Facebook. While this may just be my circle of friends, or my particular Uni (UCSB) it is clear that there is value with FB. Being able to keep in touch with your friends, to see what their up to, hell even to throw parties is all done on facebook. <p>Just this weekend, I asked my friend who was turning 21 why he didn't throw a party. He told me that having moved into his new place he didn't have internet. I asked what the hell that had to do with anything. He said that he couldn't create an event on facebook and thus no one would come.<p>So anyway, the whole point of this work-avoiding rant is that I wouldn't be so quick to judge the value of FB when it has already impacted my life and perhaps changed the college experience forever.<p>P.S. I do agree with you that FB apps are overrated. Most of my friends are sick of them, and the only one worth having is the Graffiti app.<p>P.P.S. Have some coffee. It helps.",1182883438

I know it's the way these things are normally written, but you should at least substantiate what you can. Like the ""ten times"" bit. 10X Compared to what?<p>Otherwise, I love the website design, and it seems very interesting. I'll try it out as soon as I can find Windows.<p>I'm currently learning German by reading comics, which is pretty good at providing some form of positive feedback, as well as image clues. I'm curious to see if that can be improved.",1182882813
30897,comment,30734,30875,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Side note: this is one area where functional programming languages can really shine.  In a pure functional language, all data structures are ""persistent"", meaning that all previous versions hang around as long as you keep a reference to them.  All you need to do is push them on a stack and you have built-in undo support for <i>any</i> operation in the language.  If functional languages supported SoftReferences (to my knowledge, none of the pure ones do), you could even have the garbage collector eat the bottom of the undo stack transparently.  <p>In Haskell you could hide this in a monad: it'd act like the State monad, but with an additional action to ""undo"" that just pops the stack and restores the state.  You could also put some special processing in the get/set actions to handle things like folding transparently.",1182882658

It would be nice to have language training software that took into account the scientific findings. You quote a bunch of statistics, but there are no sources on where they came from.",1182882002
30893,comment,30890,30890,0,0,pg,,,"Most of the posts on this site are merely uselessly vague, but this one is actually false.<p>I realize it would sound a lot nicer if I said that founders should strive to have a balanced life.  After all, how can an unbalanced life be good?  And yet it is probably not a coincidence that so many successful startup founders blow off everything else while they're working on the company.<p>The one non-work activity I think is a net win for founders is exercising.  But the reason it's a net win is that it helps you to work harder.",1182881885

At the minimum, stick ""Report a bug, Request a feature"" as a link on all of the pages. Then give the user a simple text field to type their comment into. If you want to go fancier, I think iminlikewithyou.com has a nice feedback mechanism. (The implication being that you could look at their site and steal the mechanism :) )",1182881652

I don't normally get sick but when I do it's almost always because of lack of sleep / stress. I'm quite good when it comes to diet and exercise and although it has helped me have good quality sleeps and lowered my levels of stress, it requires real discipline to keep it up. For anyone who suffers from stress or sleepless nights I definitely recommend a good cardio workout 2-3 times a week and serious dietery changes (no sugars, low carbs, no junk in general, no processed foods,  lots of greens and a well researched cocktail of supplements).<p>I love good coffee but I find that it is usually a lot worse for my stress levels than something comparable like an energy drink; although, both are really bad.<p>I find it fascinating how something as simple as a food colouring can completely ruin your sleep for the night, and the worst thing is you'd never know what ruined it for you.",1341700956

4212916,comment,4211602,4212328,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"I just read the article you linked. It's full of utter nonsense; it is not serious economics. One example: it talks at length about how there are different forms of value, namely <i>individual value</i> (which any normal economist would call production cost), and <i>social value</i> (the actual amount the commodity sells for). It then goes on to say, ""there are two basic forces that <i>govern</i> the way individual values become social values"" [emphasis mine]: (A) average productivity, and (B) interaction of supply and demand. The first is described mostly correctly. When describing the second, the article says, ""We only learn how much labor society has put into widget making when we enter the market and compare the products of our labor with the rest of society."" Okay, but that is not the only thing we learn from the market price. We also learn whether the society needs our commodity at all. Since the article talks about ""social value"" it almost implies that our commodity will <i>always</i> have some value to the society (it's called ""social"" after all), but that is often not the case at all.<p>But here is where the article is most clearly wrong:<p>> But most important to the MudPie theory, demand doesnt create the social value of a commodity. It only helps determine if labor has been apportioned to the right tasks. Labor is creating the value<p>First, the article is contradicting itself. It reduces everything to ""labor is creating the value"" -- if that were the case, why mention ""governing"" force (B) above at all? Also note, which value are we now talking about? Individual or social? (I assume the latter). Second, it conveniently presents the MudPie argument as ""belief that demand is creating value"". No, that is not what the MudPie argument says at all. It is the <i>recognition of demand</i> (which is an intellectual process) that is creating value, and that value can be (although not always is) wholly separate from the labor cost (or the ""individual value"").<p>Consider the following example. I buy a used or antique piece of furniture from someone who used to own it and who now believes the piece is quite useless since it is old. In addition, the owner does not mind selling me the piece at a low price since he had got out from the 20 years of using it all the ""value"" he believed he could get out of it. On inspecting the piece, I determine that the piece was made by a known designer. I resell the piece for ten times the amount I paid for it, and for three times its retail purchase price when it was new. Where is the labor here (ignoring transportation cost)? The answer is that the ""labor"" here is in me recognizing the potential value of the piece either from the appearance or through matching the label through a catalog (about 5 minutes of work). Now <i>exactly</i> the same process will occur when a reseller of a commodity finds a more profitable way to sell it. The reseller is <i>creating</i> value.<p>TL;DR There is also intellectual labor involved after the item is made but before it is sold, ignored by Marx entirely and purposefully.",1341699623

You have to acknowledge that yours is a niche audience. That means that 1) Even if you have helped me with your content, I almost certainly don't have 500 friends to hawk it to.  At best I have 1, or a handful.  In my life, I am thankful to have no one I know that could benefit from your content.  (Not meant to be a dis, but at least at this moment, knock on wood, all my friends and family are whole and healthy.)<p>Looking over your sites, I see content that was likely written over a long period of time derived from a wealthy knowledge store, but that contains typos (goes to credibility) and are put forth in an unattractive format with a giant wall of text that is largely unbroken by a good narrative.<p>Break your content up into more bite-sized pieces.  Create 'teaser' headers in intervals that people can see them from the paragraph they're on and want to get to the next section.  Include high quality pictures to make the content look more appealing and for the love of anything holy, get a much more attractive theme to your content.<p>You need to follow every piece of advice Patio11 gives out so that you can master SEO.  You need to have people be able to painlessly opt in to email updates when you post new content.  ALL content is initially forgettable, and it takes a long time before any site becomes a site you visit every day, so you need to find ways to allow interested parties to be notified when you post new content.  You also need to post content much more frequently.  You also probably need to be paying for clicks, but that means that you'd need to attract relevant, high-paying ads -- they exist, and for your type of content, they are exceedingly high, though as your mantra seems to be ""do not use anything my advertisers would be presenting"", it may be an uphill battle.<p>One of the guys I learn from (Marty Schwartz) teaches guitar, and I subscribe to his site and newsletter because he is great at giving solid guitar advice.  He also makes a living off of doing this, and he has a few tricks he uses that I should also share:<p>- Your blog posts are 'teasers'.  You should have much more comprehensive information that you can sell, in either ebook, video or whatever tangible format that people feel as valuable.  Marty has a set of DVDs that he sells for a hundred or so dollars (depending on the week) that are basically video lessons he has compiled.<p>- Make videos.  I realize that while homeless, that may present a challenge, but since you seem to be able to so actively post on HN, I figure it's probably doable in some way.  Post those videos on YouTube and hope to get an audience.  Embed those YouTube videos in blog posts so that you are cross-promoting.  Do not reveal all of your secret sauce in one video, but lure people in with helpful tips and techniques that, over time, will be a part of your grand strategy for wellness or whatever.  As you compose these videos, include them as part of your 'tangible' sale thing.<p>- Release content to new users regularly.  You need to be on their minds.  If they genuinely need your advice, they'll welcome the emails, and return.  You can track the return rate with MailChimp (and probably other mailing list managers.)<p>- Track everything.  Split test everything.  Test, test, test. Throw away what doesn't work, and re-split and re-test everything that does until it works better, or at least enough that you're retaining people better, or you are making money.<p>You're basically starting a startup, which is what all ""things trying to make money"" are.  It's a content startup, which is especially hard in even the easiest genres, but you're also in a very very niche genre arguing a fairly contrarian viewpoint.  Don't expect a huge audience, but do try to maximize the experience for every single person that gives you a minute of their time.  Ask for a minute more.  Ask for an email.  Ask for the ability to reach out to them when you make new updates.  Make the content worth their while, and make it easier to use / consume / interact with.<p>I'm out of steam, but those are basically your steps.  I know that I specifically ignored the topic at hand, but I <i>believe</i> this to be better advice than to expect others to publicize for you.",1341699517

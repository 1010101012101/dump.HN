824499,comment,824375,824475,0,0,znbailey,,,"There was an explanation of this during the TC50 presentation and in the Q&A afterward.<p>From my simple understanding, this is a management application layered <i>on top</i> of the Mechanical Turk platform which is able to provide more robust/advanced management and analytics in terms of tracking the quality and speed of repeat turkers, as well as being able to integrate with other commoditized/outsourced labor systems. Due to being able to maintain more state concerning tasks and turkers, they are able to provide valuable intelligence about how trustworthy and accurate the results are.<p>It was very interesting during the Q&A when Bradley Horowitz asked the company rep if he thought that Amazon might simply do this themselves - but the presenter stated firmly that they had a pretty good personal relationship with the people at Amazon and they took pride on the turk service as really being a black box type of platform.<p>Regardless, the main problem this business faces (which was handily pointed out by the experts) is the issue of gaining traction - how do you make big businesses aware of this as a possible solution to their labor issues? Even at MySpace where they pay 300 people to moderate photos for obscenity they have not realized they could much more effectively and cheaply be leveraging MT for this task.",1253041163

824497,comment,824332,824386,0,0,breck,,,"""Nobody 10,000 years ago had blue eyes,""<p>My reaction is that he misspoke here or he overstated his claim to make a point.<p>I know nothing about the proportion of people with blue eyes back then or right now for that matter. But I think at the very least, you could only make that claim with a tiny, tiny, tiny amount of confidence.<p>Maybe the proportion of humans with blue eyes was smaller back then, maybe it was larger, or maybe it was the same. I don't know. But to claim nobody 10,000 years ago had blue eyes is an impossible point to prove unless you have DNA samples from every human alive 10,000 years ago. We might be able to say that all the people alive today with blue eyes descended from one ancestor, but we can't claim to know about the population of people with blue eyes back then. For all I know, half the population 10,000 years ago could have had blue eyes but then got wiped out by swine blue.<p>That's like saying no one 100 years ago was over 7'6"" tall. I know a bit more about height and think that this statement may be true. But it would be real hard to prove. Now shift the timespan back by 2 orders of magnitude, and I think it'd be harder to prove.<p>I'm not saying that the general idea is wrong, but I'm just it would be a good idea to question that claim a lot before thinking about reasons why that might be the case.",1253041122

824396,comment,819942,824003,0,0,lsc,,,"huh.  Interesting blog.  But what I read doesn't have anything about objective value, or price signaling preference.  Link?<p>Yes, I understand that one of these 32GiB ram, 8 core servers is worth about $1500 to me, or $6000, to someone unable to assemble a server from parts.  There can be no value without a valuer, so technically, there can be no objective value. (just like I can't prove that you are not a figment of my imagination.  It's impossible to do with the tools provided by philosophy.  But I am unlikely to live a very successful life if I act as if others around me don't actually exist.)<p>However, the price of a commodity tends to fall to just above the cost of production, because, in the example above, building a server is fairly trivial once you have a good ESD setup, so if you charge $3K instead of $6K for the $1.5K server, someone else is going to charge $2.5, or $2K, until you get down to the smallest profit margin someone will accept to do the job.[1] This is what I mean by 'objective value'<p>Of course, some businesses try to say ""Oh, our product is not a commodity""  which is fine, but I would argue as a businessperson, I want as many of the inputs to my business as possible to be commodities.  The idea is that if I use commodities, it is easy to compare pricing between vendors, and if one vendor fucks it up, I can easily switch to another.  'differentiated' products usually cost more, but they usually provide less value for those very reasons.<p>Of course, some businesses seem to prefer to spend $6K on the $1.5K server, even after seeing another vendor charge $3K for what amounts to the same hardware.   I don't know why this is.  My theory is that the people making that decision, the managers, do not have enough technical knowledge to know that the hardware is comparable, but more importantly, they are more concerned with minimizing their own personal risk than with maximizing the total expected return for the shareholders, who are ultimately paying for the hardware.<p>Clearly, I don't understand that market. Quite possibly there are good rational reasons why they like to pay 3x what they need to pay for hardware. I don't target this market because while I can build good servers, this market wants something else.  I don't understand them so I can not serve them well.  Besides, there are many good companies serving that market, and right now, I'm scaling at a comfortable pace.  Serving a large corporation would require speeding that growth perhaps more than is healthy.<p>I will stick with serving my people for now.  If shareholders start demanding that larger companies watch their budgets more closely, well, I'm here, and I'm learning more every day.  Hopefully, when that day comes, I will be prepared.   Until then, there are enough technical people with hobbies and small businesses to make me quite comfortable<p>[1] see serversdirect.com  - I have no experience with them, but a co-lo customer of mine uses them. their prices /as posted on the website/ are very good;  about what I'd charge if you asked me to build you servers.",1253038622

She talks about possessing knowledge - these two things are VERY different.  I believe the methods to teach a kid to love learning, and the method to spoon-feed knowledge down a kid's throat, are two completely separate things.  A child won't gain knowledge unless he/she has the DESIRE to do so.  Finding that desire is then key.<p>A second thing, she argues that knowledge helps a person think of better alternatives to a situation.  This is not necessarily true.  Often, solutions are found by those who are not clouded by a million existing alternatives, but are able to use their own reasoning to come up with a superior solution.",1253038042

It can show you any book you want, but it's expensive and doesn't do much more than allow you to buy and read books. I guess it can read book to you, too. But that's about it.

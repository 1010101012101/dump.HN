1254121,comment,1253783,1253783,0,0,vaksel,,,"I have two concerns here.(well 3, but swombat covered that one)<p>1. If you are going to penalize sites for being ""slow"" then how about you tell us what slow is? Is a site loading in 10 seconds ""slow""? is a site with a 5mb index page that loads in 15 seconds ""slow""? How about some metrics so that we can optimize properly?<p>And what will that do to a lot of content rich sites? If you have a lot of images/flash/javascript it sounds like you are going to get screwed for trying to make a better looking user experience.<p>2. Of course Google search results experiment would affect user satisfaction. You are looking for results, and you want to do a lot of searches. BUT when you are clicking to see the result you like, I think most people would be willing to wait 2 seconds extra to load the more relevant information.<p>Sounds like this is yet another attempt at boosting big sites, where large sites like eHow and Mahalo get preference in results just because they can afford faster servers.",1270853808

Some code had to change given that the recompile was done in c#, that was my understanding. I've done some follow up and yes, some core PHP code was rewritten. 
AOL was perfectly positioned then they blew it, big time, but the TW acquisition was certain to do that. 
Google, AOL, Facebook are all trying to be our primary portal. They want us to consume as much of the internet through their services as possible, obviously. You could argue that Google has replaced AOL in that regard. 
I thought I was clear that the cost benefit and the decrease in server costs would be a big benefit to them doing this. 
I never said or thought that had all their developers working on this, but as daily FB user its clear they are not working on new features or extending their framework. 
I didn't realize that speed problems were that substantial, I've never heard anyone complain about FB page load times. I think they did this as way to control costs primarily by reducing servers. 
I see FB as being just another stepping stone like MySpace anf Friendster and others. Apple is perfectly positioned to walk into the social space by simply extending their current properties like iTunes and the AppStore. How will FB compete with that?

Totalitarian states can also discover that being open to commerce can be in their interest, but still act coercively when doing so suits them more.

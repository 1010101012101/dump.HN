As a Mac user and Open Source fan, I didn't jump at the idea. Glad to hear, that a lot of people think C# is a good choice. I'm excited to learn it!<p>Any suggestions for a good book or website? I've been programming in C and C++ quite a bit, but its been a few years. I've only been doing functional programming since then and would probably need a refresher on object oriented programming.<p>Can someone comment on the best development environment for Unity/C# when using a 2011 Mac Air with 4GB Ram? Should I install bootcamp, use Parallels Desktop or Unity+Mono under Mac OS?",1332604758

3749639,comment,3749268,3749268,2,0,codeonfire,,,"What motivates me?  The idea that most employee type jobs are working for unintelligent people who smugly feel they have accomplished something because they based they career around exploiting developers, artists, writers, etc.  I've met hundreds of people like this, people who freely admit they planned their entire college experience to get into a management role as soon as possible so they could loaf and be non-contributors.  These people are often paid more, get budget control and people's salaries and jobs to control, and yet they have done nothing with their careers.  I'm talking about extremely dumb people who reverted back to grade school level behavior after college.  They don't DO anything except maneuver violently to capitalize on and take credit for other's successes and hard work.  They do this like their life depends on it because it does.<p>When you read about how there is a developer shortage or that 75% of developers leave the field after some age, it is because they are simply asking this corporate environment full of people who can't find anyone new to exploit.  Most people in tech at some point realize that they are being exploited by people that faked their way through the hard technical part of a tech career and find something else to do.  There are people out there who truly walked the walk, but they are few.  If you are working at a place long term you should ask yourself what the hell you're doing there.",1332604372

If you're coming from a C background, it's actually quite nice.<p>For example, you can use include ( ) in so many ways, autoload classes, write getters/setters and override anything, implement views, etc. Everything ""just runs"", or can be compiled into fast code with HipHop (or cached with APC).<p>OK, to be fair, I would say that PHP with a framework that takes advantage of it can be very cool. I can't exactly share our codebase, but you can see the open source version from 2 years ago : <a href=""http://phponpie.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phponpie.com</a> to aprpeciate some of the ""beauty"" of PHP<p>And it can be extremely expressive and powerful. Sure, it can't do everything that Node.js can do, but for serving requests it can be awesome. It isolates every script in its own memory space, so you never have to worry about anything! The one thing I do not like about PHP is that it's married to the outdated thread-based webserver model, while the new boys on the block (NGinX, Node.js and the new Apache) all use event-based programming.<p>Don't downvote just because I said PHP can be cool.

(I work for a healthcare software company in Wisconsin.)<p>In particular, a sensible coding style and sensible development practices (yes, name your variables sensibly! yes, use source control! yes, have code review and automated tools to catch common errors) can remove the bad. It also helps if your company wrote its own (quite good) IDE for the language so you don't have to use Intersystems'.<p>Honestly the most fun thing about M/MUMPS/Caché is that there's very little boilerplate and you can write sensible code quickly. It's like being stuck with Java and then suddenly moving to Python or Ruby. (With, yes, a few pitfalls that these languages don't have, and quite a few features missing.

First of all, the task itself is extremely heterogeneous within-task even if you re-teach the same subject several times; second, no two classes are really the same, and although there are classes I've taught seven or eight times now, the particular dynamic of the particular classroom required adaptation, using different examples, different activities, and in some cases different evaluations.  Not to mention all the different levels and subjects of classes that I've needed to teach.<p>At least, that's what good teachers do.  (I don't mean that as an attack on the parent poster's teaching---I find it at least possible that they did all these things but didn't realise how much variability there was in the task.)

Off the top of my head I can&#x27;t think of a reactor thats unstable in operation.  Hands off (like that TV series life after humans where the people all disappear) almost all stabilize and eventually shutdown on their own.  Maybe those crazy graphite reactors are not inherently stable.<p>There&#x27;s two linked issues.<p>Fission reactors get about 10% of their heat from decay products (the &quot;waste&quot;) decaying away.  That means there is no instant off switch.  The &quot;off&quot; position is still 10% out for hours/days/weeks (well it decays away eventually...).  As the Japanese found out the hard way, 10% of a huge amount of power is enough residual heat to cause an awful disaster.<p>The other is surface area / volume ratio.  Couple gigawatts thermal like the Japanese and there&#x27;s not enough surface area to cool it without giant pumps when shutdown.  Couple MW like a nuclear sub and the surface area ratio is better, theoretically you could probably walk away from one without anything awful happening.  The people who know aren&#x27;t talking.  Fusion you&#x27;re talking about something a millimeter across not multiple meters.  Walk away or have a computer crash or whatever and it seems impossible for something that small to cause much damage.<p>There are some practical physics reasons why making a fusion reactor the size of the sun is really easy and the smaller you go the harder it gets, but there are practical engineering reasons why making one bigger than a millimeter would be a huge PITA.  On the other hand if you could make a fission reactor the size of a millimeter that would certainly solve a lot of painful thermal engineering problems, but the physics just doesn&#x27;t work (long story...)",1381234538

There are not separate entities, they are a part of the same continuum that made the joke a reality: fat people are lazy and have no impulse control and deserve ridicule.<p>> Digging deeper, personal offensive jokes are acceptable when then joker knows the target well enough to know that it won&#x27;t be taken as an actual offense. That&#x27;s what makes them risky e.g. in workplaces where people don&#x27;t know each other as well.

As such, I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with these jokes.<p>The amount of shit fat people get from close friends about being fat is just as bad as a society from a whole, so why exactly would it be OK if it was just someone you knew personally hating you vs. a stranger on the internet?<p>> The hateful comments are a different story, but I find that it helps to remember that they are written by children and other people who simply lack the development of empathy, and should neither be taken seriously nor held completely responsible. They just don&#x27;t understand, just as a toddler wouldn&#x27;t understand the repercussions of firing a gun.<p>People are fully aware of what they post.

Apparently when a ridiculous looking person walks in people are supposed to be some how supportive of the attempt to better himself. In the UK, its cause for a lot of micky taking.<p>Back to the case in point, even the subject is not objecting to the humor, she is objecting deliberately nasty comments specifically meant to be nasty.

Probably almost as much discussion as about what fancy car to buy with the winnings.  (come to think of it, I only remember the stock pagers when I was on the east coast, so it&#x27;s possible that in silicon valley there was more faith.)<p>Of course, this was the very end of that boom, too, and this was 1/3rd of my life ago, so 1997 and 1999 kinda blend together.  I could be talking mostly about 1999, so it&#x27;s possible that there was confidence among the workers until very nearly the end, and I just didn&#x27;t notice.<p>As a sidenote (and possible useful bit of advice for youngsters who are employable now, but are concerned about after the crash)  In &#x27;99, I chose to go for a prestigious job over a job with options.   Obviously, it was the right choice;  I still brag about that job, while the options would have been toilet paper long before I vested.",1381234086

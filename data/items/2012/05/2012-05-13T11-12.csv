Here's the one time I didn't even tip at all.<p>I'd just had an enjoyable but naturally stressful night seeing an ex who came into the city from westchester for the day. I left her at grand central and couldn't be fucked to take the subway, but it was 11:30 at night on Friday at grand central - tough to find a free cab. But after only a few minutes of strategic searching, I finally manage to spot an open cab on the clock - score!<p>Now you should know this crucial NYC cab law:<p>> A Driver who has been dispatched must not refuse, by words, gestures or any other means to provide transportation to a person who has prearranged the trip with a destination within the City of New York, the counties of Westchester or Nassau or Newark Airport. [0]<p>All ""prearranged"" in a cab means is that the passenger is in the cab and told the driver a destination. It's a really important law - for one, it means cab drivers can't refuse destinations based on race/socioeconomic status/etc. Not all cab drivers like this law because it impacts their take, so they'll try to avoid picking you up.<p>Anyway, this cab driver notices I've spotted him from about 20 feet away and starts rolling down the passenger window, asking where I want to go repeatedly. If I tell him, and he doesn't like it, he'll get the fuck out of there before I get in the cab. I knew exactly what was going on, but I'd had a long god damn night and for once wasn't going to have it. So I just thought ""fuck it,"" didn't say a single word, and just got in the cab and told him my block.<p>He's pissed as <i>fuck</i> because <i>he</i> knows that <i>I</i> know he has to take me there, since I ignored him outside the cab. He doesn't even try talking me out of the cab, he just slams on the fucking gas and drives like a complete asshole so he can try to get a better fare after me. I actually am sort of glad to get home quicker but it's actually maliciously bad driving. I'll still tip him though - that's a big part of his take-home.<p>I realize I don't have any cash, and it was only like a 9 dollar ride, but I figure I'll tip him extra to make up for hit he'll take on the credit card. When he sees the credit card he exclaims ""oh come on, credit card? fuck...""<p>At that point, I reminded him that he <i>had</i> to accept the credit card, just like he <i>had</i> to drive me to my home, and (in as many words) suggested he accept the laws governing his trade. Then I tipped him 0 and told the stunning blonde woman getting into the cab that the driver's a prick.<p>[0] 55-20a-1 <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/2011rulebook_ch55.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/2011rulebook_ch55....</a>",1336909210

This is true for your decision right now.<p>A few thoughts for you on that:<p>1. Irrevocably commit to doing it.  Book a meeting with the founders to discuss ""something important"".  Or tell your significant other that you've decided to exit by a certain date.  Just do <i>something</i> that commits you to this course of action.<p>2. Get creative about why you're leaving.  Instead of leaving because the company is a sinking ship, think of a diplomatic, but still truthful, reason for exiting.  For example, focus on what you are going to do next, and supply that as the reason: ""I'm much more interested in working on this kind of technology/product/etc. and I want to go pursue my dream.""<p>3. If you can't bring yourself to tell them your decision face-to-face, put it in writing.  Email them to tell them what you've decided, and close it with, ""Can we talk?""  Then hash it out with them.  This is a great way to be done with something (see #1) because once the email is sent, it's sent.<p>4. Always remember that it is never as bad as you think it will be.  It's just business, they will understand your reasons if they are reasonable businesspeople too.  If they're decent individuals you'll stay on good terms with them.  They'll miss you, they'll be ""disappointed"", but they'll get over it.  And don't be surprised if they've already expected you to do this months ago.  It is usually obvious to employers when their employees are unhappy or frustrated.<p>You already know what to do.  Now go get it done!  Best of luck to you.",1336908690

So you only need to slurp the source code and call <i>eval</i> on it. This reduces workflow overhead to zero and should not be underestimated. For example, in a JS-based language for browsers, this means you don't need an extra set of scripts for a native JS environment (like node.js) for creating JS object files.<p>- With an interpreter, there's <i>no phase separation</i>. In a compiler you're always dealing with <i>expressions</i>, and you can't deal with the <i>values</i> they evaluate to. In an interpreter you have access to both, so you can do a lot more fun crazy things.<p>- With an interpreter, the implementor keeps <i>more control</i> of programs. It's simply much easier to instrument and manipulate the execution of programs when you are interpreting them than when they run on their own on the target architecture.<p>- Potentially <i>smaller code sizes</i>. In languages with macros, source code is highly compressed and irredundant - basically all boilerplate has already been stripped away by the programmer.

And you need to keep in mind that this rule is only about the core network reach, companies are still allowed to be pretty autonomous about charging for the last 2 KM of the connection. And from what I've heard, companies like Elisa are still charging plenty for fibre digouts, even in higher density areas. And unless you want to make due with 3G, your only option is to get them to bring fibre since there's literally no real competition, most areas get divided into smaller lots between ""competitors"". Even if they use the same company to actually lay the fibre. And the house owners have no say in what happens to old copper lines.",1336907948

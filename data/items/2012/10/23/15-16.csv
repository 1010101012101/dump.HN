Also, as a woman in tech, I hear all the time that ""women just aren't as interested in computer science as men are,"" yet in my experience that's not at all the case. In India (where CS is not seen as something that predominantly boys do) 55% of CS degrees go to women. In the 1960s people said, ""women just aren't as good at playing instruments as men because they don't have the lung power;"" when blind auditions were introduced the number of women accepted into major orchestras tripled overnight. There are a lot of examples of people assuming women ""just aren't interested"" and that changing very rapidly when cultural barriers and discrimination is removed.",1351007971

Fuel is very expensive and has diminishing returns (the more fuel you put on, the more fuel you need to lift the extra fuel you put on).  After Voyager, Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons (among others) have used gravity assist to get to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto respectively (NH is still en route).<p>Even Stereo, a two-satellite pair in earth-trailing and earth-following orbits looking at the Sun, used gravity assist (with the Moon).<p>Gravity assist is one way to provide ""delta-v"" (velocity change, the coin of the realm in propulsion).  You can provide negative delta-v using aerobraking -- orbiting your destination, Mars say, and slowing down using atmospheric friction.  This is used on the Mars orbiters.<p>As usual, see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget</a>",1351007927

I think Minovitch is basically an engineer at heart, and is resentful that all of the attention seems to go to the scientists, i.e. people who come up with the actual physical theories about mass and energy and so forth.<p>Our culture does value scientists more than engineers. You could argue that this is good because theories are universally applicable and represent fundamental understanding, or that this is bad because many theories have absolutely no applications and that it's the engineers who deliver value to society. You could also argue that the amount of prestige that we heap on scientists tends to go to their heads and they stop doing good work. But whatever.

Even if it were true that there were no mechanism for doing remoting on Wayland (which isn't the case; remoting just moves to a separate layer in the stack, as handled by NX or VNC or whatever), it would still be a reasonable sacrifice, because it's not what <i>most</i> users want.  Doing X remoting is the exception, not the rule, and there's no reason for the *nix world to get stuck in the Windows mentality of having to be backwards-compatible with every application and protocol written since the dawn of time.  Having a huge networking layer shoved into the middle of the display stack has measurable costs in terms of both maintainability and performance, and users that have any use case other than yours suffer as a result.  Android, which is now the most-installed Linux ""distribution"" (such as it is) ever, had to invent its own display layer because X was a terrifying, bloated hacktastrophe, and they come up with something specific to their platform such that now no other Linux users can benefit from any of their display work.  That sucks.  Keeping network transparency as a core feature doesn't pass the cost-benefit smell test.",1351004869

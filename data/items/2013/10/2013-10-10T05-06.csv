6525885,comment,6525511,6525511,4,0,kumarvembu,,,"I got into developing POS / retail management solutions in 2004 and founded GoFrugal Technologies. When I started, it did seem like a low hanging fruit, ripe and just waiting to be consumed<p>Close to 10 years and after engaging with 200,000+ retailers across India and with 20,000+ customers in about 20 different types of retail businesses - I have started appreciating the complexities of retail<p>The simple reasons why POS solutions are struggling to catch up fast with the times are\n      1. All retailers have the freedom to innovate at the front-end & there are many others who push down innovation at the front-end to the retailers : either because their customers are demanding or because the banks, technology vendors, government and competitors are constantly pushing the retailers to introduce change at the front end\n      2. Retailers want to service demand - come what may. The manufacturers continue to innovate on packaging, pricing, promotions etc. and no one waits for the retailer&#x27;s system to be ready to handle these changes\n      3. Retailers have to keep the cost per transaction as low as possible to earn a profit. This, combined with the fact that retail is different every 100 miles, makes it hard to build a universal retail solution<p>I hope this explains why POS in most cases continues to be pain point for both retailers and consumers",1381384374

When you learn those sorts of things you create a mostly sub-conscious mental association between certain triggers and the response to them. When you learn to meditate you create an association between some sort of trigger and a state of relaxation. The trigger can be anything, often people use a combination of posture and some sort of chant to help. For myself it tends to be some combo of breathing out and relaxing my shoulders.<p>You can use the same technique to tap into other mental states but it may be more difficult.",1381384361

From what I&#x27;ve seen they tend to avoid unilateral donation/collections, but go in for the specifics. For instance, the school I installed the 30 desks at, they donated virtually all the classroom equipment and props along with an instructor to help local teachers integrate the new material into their classes. As I understand it the financing for all that came from donations through collections in their churches. Now whilst I&#x27;m an atheist, that impressed me.

This outrage is a bit misplaced:<p>1) South African teachers/vendors/Education Departments lack the skills to manage non-Microsoft systems. Yes it shouldn&#x27;t be that way, but it is.<p>2) Java is not really a great first programming language (see Joel on JavaSchools). Pascal, and, later Delphi have been taught for years, and are well understood by teachers. They should probably just dump Delphi, and stick to Pascal. Attempts to look &quot;relevant&quot; end up looking foolish.<p>In the early-mid 1990&#x27;s, when I was in what&#x27;s today called grade 8 and 9 I did LOGO, for non-examinable Computer Studies, and it was brilliant. Although I didn&#x27;t choose Computer Studies for my later school years(where Pascal was used), when I got to university, my positive early experiences drew me back into the world of CS. I doubt I would have gotten the same visceral thrill that I got from LOGO, if I had to wrestle with AWT or Swing at the time.<p>School Computer Studies is NOT meant to be a gateway to a career, and there are plenty of post-school options for people who want to become programmers. Computer Studies isn&#x27;t even a prerequisite for university CS - everything is taught from scratch again. It also seems like recent graduates of some of the insitutions (&quot;Universities of Technology&quot;,  formerly Technikons) that supposedly focus on carreer preparedness struggle with concepts like writing loops. Perhaps these Technikons and programming colleges should also focus on the basics first, before worrying about &quot;career readiness&quot;.<p>SA schooling is a mess.

Some studies show massive improvement. Other studies show minor improvement, while some studies show no improvement at all. It is by no means clear in the literature that Dual N-Back actually helps more than an active placebo.<p><pre><code>    This is very damaging to the case that dual n-back increases IQ. Not only do the\n    better studies find a drastically smaller effect, they are not sufficiently \n    powered to find such a small effect at all, even aggregated in a meta-analysis, \n    with a power of ~11%, which is dismal indeed when compared to the usual \n    benchmark of 80%, and leads to worries that even that is too high an estimate \n    and that the active control studies are aberrant somehow in being subject to a \n    winner’s curse or subject to other biases. (Because most studies used convenient \n    passive control groups and the passive effect size is 3x larger, they in \n    aggregate are very well-powered: 94%; however, we already know how they are \n    skewed upwards, so we don’t care if we can detect a biased effect or not.) In \n    particular, Boot et al 2013 argues that active control groups do not suffice to \n    identify the true causal effect because the subjects in the active control group \n    can still have different expectations than the experimental group, and the \n    group’ differing awareness & expectations can cause differing performance on \n    tests; they suggest recording expectancies (somewhat similar to Redick et al \n    2013), checking for a dose-response relationship (see the following section for \n    whether dose-response exists for dual n-back/IQ), and using different \n    experimental designs which actively manipulate subject expectations to identify \n    how much effects are inflated by remaining placebo/expectancy effects.\n</code></pre>\nThat said, there isn&#x27;t any evidence of <i>harm</i>, either, so at worst, you&#x27;ll waste your time if it doesn&#x27;t work out for you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ</a>",1381383483

But in practice the compiler has to solve a problem that is much harder than the problem the programmer would have to solve to write efficient C code for this one case. It&#x27;s also one that has different complexity.<p>So you&#x27;re in the situation now that a few compilers (VERY few, though this is very very hard to do) will actually beat stupid programmers in optimization, but there is nothing any compiler can do to beat the optimizations a good programmer will implement.<p>As for startup time, the sad part of that is that is one area where you could really improve C/C++ : startup time. Right now a C program has 4 distinct things that need to run before main() starts, and involve quite a bit of calculation, C++ has a lot more (the various kinds of initializers which can cause arbitrarily complex calculation).<p>A lot of these initializers result in constant (and small) memory layouts, and could in fact be run at compile time. What you generally do in initialization phase is to calculate registered classes (e.g. for serialization, or protocols) and make indexes of them. Maybe even compile regexes. All of that could be optimized to occur at compile time (as long as memory usage of the code is reasonable).",1381383385

In their database, hidden to the store owner, this &quot;Discount&quot; product was flagged as a taxable item with negative value. If someone wanted to buy a $10 item and handed you a $10 coupon in a state with 7% tax, the register would tell the cashier to give the customer $0.70 in change, and take $0.70 out of the month&#x27;s tax you owe to the state. There were similar glitches in basic, critical calculations in inventory tracking, cost of goods sold, etc. There were oddities like if you used a barcode scanner, and had mis-typed a barcode when adding a product to inventory and lost a digit, the scanner would still pull up the product via the partial match, and it&#x27;d also add sales tax to that item even if it was marked as a non-taxable product (i.e. groceries in a state that doesn&#x27;t tax them). So someone doing inventory could mess up your sales tax collection on that product for the whole year and it might never be noticed.<p>It&#x27;s not a solid product, and the only reason we still use it is its integration with our Shopify store to keep the website inventory updated as items sell out in the retail store.",1381383311

3905859,comment,3902697,3903421,2,0,disgruntledphd2,,,"Again, I completely see where you are coming from. However, the difference between a Masters and a PhD are huge, far bigger than the gaps between any other form of education.<p>In a PhD, essentially everything you learn is to master a particular topic, or solve some kind of problem. This can often involve programming (it did for me) and almost certainly involves statistics (again, it did for me). The most important characteristic of a PhD is that you learn all this yourself (I certainly did). For instance, I was the only person in  my department to learn R (although there were some oldtime Fortran and C programmers in my department), and then I ended up learning some python and java along with bash to deal with data manipulation problems and administering psychological measures of the internet. These are the kinds of skills that lead into me possessing some of the skills needed to be a data scientist, and with some experience in the private sector, I'll get there.<p>Bear in mind that I (almost) have a Psychology PhD, and this would all have been far easier for me if I had worked in physics, chemistry or any of the harder sciences. So from my perspective, I can see that this is where the data scientists of the future are going to come from.<p>Note that I looked up the job market, and made a conscious decision to train myself in these kinds of skills throughout my PhD, but if you are not capable of performing this kind of analysis that you probably shouldn't be doing a PhD anyway.<p>I really don't see how programming upends all that grad students learn (though I would be delighted to hear your thoughts), as to me it just seemed like the application of logic with the aid of computers. I'm not that good a programmer though, certainly not outside the application of stats, but within the next few years I will be.",1335703507

But to make money.<p>Yunnus/Grameen had some good ideas (read his book) that are not really about the money they give out to poor people. The money is only a way to get the poor people to come to the meetings regularly and follow certain important principles, like ""all my children go to school"" or ""we eat every day three meals"" or ""we will try to build a stable home made of bricks/tin roof"" etc.<p>Seems trivial, but those are important steps. Not to mention the fact that many Grameen credits are given to groups that mutually guarantee their credit! If one person fails to pay back, the others have to pay back for this person. People learn by that to work together and to trust each other (building social capital, the very basis of every lasting economic development, read ""F.Fukuyama, Trust - Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity"" for example).<p>Just handing out little credits will of course not help a lot, but in some situations it may help, so its worthwhile anyway.<p>A next important step would be to make laws in all countries that banks /have to/ give one free savings accounts to everybody. No credit account of course, but a right to have a bank account would be an important and easy to implement step.",1335703058

So if you can get a job at Microsoft for 110k + 25k in benefits, and the start wants you for 70k + 15k in benefits  then your giving up 50K in salary per year and you need to get enough shares (which are probably worthless) to make up for that * the number of years it takes you to vest.<p>As a yardstick I would aim for 1.5x the rate of whatever the last round of investment was.  AKA if they got 5 million and your giving up 50k then look for 10% of whatever the investor got vested over 3 years.  (Also, the further from your market rate the shorter your vesting schedule needs to be.)<p>PS: Don't forget the idea is paying you in stock needs to be more expensive than paying you in cash or they are going to want to pay you in as much worthless stock as possible.",1335701954

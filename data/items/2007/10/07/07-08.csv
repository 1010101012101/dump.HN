64372,comment,63617,63870,0,0,rms,,,">There is no such thing as a completely free (or perfect) market , governments exist to ensure that the weak don't get crushed by the strong in the society.<p>Exactly, this is the fundamental flaw of capitalism. Once you have power it is too easy to get more power and no one ever seems to want to share power and the ensuing resources. For now, society needs some redistribution of resources to work and elected, non-corrupt governments are a much better way of evening things out than charity.",1191743223

64369,comment,63113,63113,0,0,nanijoe,,,"Facebooks is like Geocities..and Ning is like Yahoo Groups.\nIf you take a look at the feature differences between Geocities and Facebook, you'll realize that (horrors), there are few real ones.\nThe way geocities worked was that people would create a home page, say something about themselves and upload their pictures to that page (ie they had a profile). Their friends could leave comments on a guestbook (now fondly referred to as a 'wall') , and people often had links to their friends' geocities pages thereby plotting a Social Graph.<p>There were no mobile updates which is ok, considering most people did not have mobile phones.<p>\nAlas, there were no REST, PHP or Javascript APIs...oh wait, the users did not care then, and still don't care that facebook has them.<p>Geocities did have sophisticated multimedia capabilities for the time it existed.<p>A 1980 honda is as much a car as a 2007 Ferarri.<p>Facebook, myspace, hi5, orkut, friendster, dogster etc are all improved versions of geocities..and Ning is yahoo groups in disguiuse",1191742623

64366,comment,64362,64362,0,0,rms,,,">Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has even declared his quest to chart a ""social graph"" of human relationships the way that cartographers once charted the world.<p>Whether or not Facebook is worth 10 billion dollars on the market today as an acquired company is irrelevant; Facebook does represent a shift in how we are social on the internet. Hacker News does as well, but I've only met people who are willing to meet up with me in cities other than Pittsburgh and on Facebook they all live in Pittsburgh.<p>If nothing better comes along, Facebook will be worth more than 10 billion dollars in the long run. There's also a good chance something better will come along, and it will probably happen overnight if Google buys the old TV frequencies and licenses space on all the old TV towers. Maybe someone smart will figure out how to implement the semantic web by himself or with a YC style investor.<p>The barriers between the web and the real world have really started to dissolve. I know a lot of people around my age that are in long term (for 22 year olds) relationships with people they met on the internet.<p>The Facebook Generation is a small part of America. It's the people who went to four year universities and their friends. For all of my age-group peers, I use the descriptor Generation Y because I hope that generations X, Y, and Z are the final generations of Humanity. Hopefully by the time that Generation Z has children we will all be Post-Humans, sipping our drinks in the enlightenment of eternity.",1191742359

The first part sounds like a win for readability, but  I think this might be a net lose because it could be harder to navigate with the keyboard,but maybe I'm just not using my imagination. Worse is the addition of syntactic complexity, which makes metaprogramming harder. It wouldn't be a problem if it was just a macro that compiles down to regular syntax.  I'm not sure what you're talking about in the second part - probably due to my lack of experience with Java and C#. Are you saying you want the editor to display these objects in a special way?<p>3.<p><pre><code>    (set-macro-character #\~\n		     #'(lambda (stream char)\n			 (random (read stream t nil t))))\n    CL-USER> ~40\n    25\n    CL-USER> ~40\n    18\n</code></pre>\nSupport for ranges is left as an exercise for the reader.<p>4. Detecting and modeling arbitrary, informally specified state machines in code would be hard. Creating a library that provides a DSL for making state machines and displaying visual representations sounds fairly easy.<p>5. I'm not sure if you're asking for something like Common Lisp's macroexpand function, or Slime's disassemble command. I'm pretty sure it's one or the other - maybe both.<p>The notion of language support for provably correct programs (the type systems in ML and Haskell are a step in this direction) is very interesting to me, but I'm not sure it's ideal for a production language.",1191740855

10935778,comment,10930726,10934655,0,0,cyphar,,,"Free software allows users to get access to fixes for systems not supported by vendors. Saying &quot;free software&quot; is more secure is not correct (just look at libpurple, a free software library riddled with bugs). What is correct is that you have a much better shot at white hats and security researchers finding bugs in free software, and the fixes for those bugs being freely available.<p>Black hats (trust me, I&#x27;ve known a few) will gladly attack proprietary software (usually with more glee, because there&#x27;s far less review of proprietary software in general). Using proprietary software doesn&#x27;t save you from black hats. But it does give you more chances of white hats finding the bugs sooner.<p>Security isn&#x27;t a binary state, it&#x27;s a lifestyle. All code has bugs, and almost all bugs can be security bugs. Taking steps to add more layers to your security is what you should be doing, not arguing that &quot;because the software is free someone found it!&quot;.",1453258595

10935757,comment,10934666,10935049,0,0,taliesinb,,,"> You could code numerical things in Mathematica, but you&#x27;ll get poor performance compared to MATLAB.<p>Yes and no. MATLAB and Mathematica have access to the same BLAS libraries. If you&#x27;re using packed arrays in Mathematica, you can expect similar performance for many pure numeric things. Mathematica is missing some of the higher level primitives, there&#x27;s no built-in function that corresponds to DGEMM, as a random example.<p>Another weakness is that there&#x27;s only a handful of packed array types, for a 64-bit system, you get tensors composed of doubles, signed 64-bit ints, and complex numbers; no bool arrays, no unsigned 32-bit or 16-bit, no enum or factor arrays. Now this is purely a performance thing -- you can make tensors/arrays containing anything you want, but their contents just won&#x27;t be &#x27;packed&#x27; into a contiguous region of memory, instead they&#x27;ll be arrays of pointers to other memory on the heap. Such arrays are slower to work with, much less memory efficient, harder to pass over an FFI, etc.<p>There&#x27;s also a lack of fast workhorse-ish functions involving tensors, so there isn&#x27;t a way to broadcast a condition (say 4 <= x <= 10) onto an input matrix to get a &#x27;mask matrix&#x27; as is so common in MATLAB and R and so on, and one of their secrets to writing fastish code in a interpreted language.<p>On the other hand, you can deal with ordinary lists (and Associations) that contain arbitrary types (as with any dynamically typed language), which makes many kinds of algorithmic work very straightforward. After all, not everything is best represented as an n-tensor of reals or ints or bools!  But if your lists <i>do</i> happen to be homogeneous lists of ints or reals (of any rank), they will usually end up being stored more efficiently as mentioned above, a process that is, for better or worse, totally invisible unless you know about Developer/PackedArrayQ.<p>There is also Compile (<a href=""https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Compile.html?q=Compile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Compile.html?q=Co...</a>) which still has a fairly limited type system, but will still let you bypass large amounts of interpreter overhead when you need to do something performance critical.<p>> you wouldn&#x27;t analytically solve a sophisticated PDE so you would use numerics<p>The whole analytic/numerical distinction really isn&#x27;t true anymore (e.g. <a href=""https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NDSolve.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NDSolve.html</a>, <a href=""https://reference.wolfram.com/language/FEMDocumentation/tutorial/FiniteElementProgramming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reference.wolfram.com/language/FEMDocumentation/tuto...</a>).<p>> so that explains why MATLAB seems more prevalent.<p>I think the explanation lies more with MATLAB having exactly the right features (or the right toolboxes) at the right time to fill niches in thousands of engineering and research labs. If you&#x27;re running a lab, and that postdoc who wrote the code driving your instrument has long since left, there is very little reason to embrace a new language, even if it has caught up in various ways, and especially if that new language isn&#x27;t tailored exactly to what you are doing, and would prefer you to use some strange thing called &quot;functional programming&quot;, etc.",1453258166

Most robberies aim to do it just once and get away with as much money as possible but due to inflation, the amount you need to steal to make it worthwhile corresponds to huge amount of physical weight of that cash.<p>Case in point, lets assume that each bill weighs 1 gram. So in 1933, John Dillinger robbed the Central National Bank for $76,000 [1] which translates to about 160 pounds worth of cash. Easy enough to carry off with a few horses.<p>Now, accounting for inflation, that $76,000 will be roughly $1.2million in today&#x27;s value. If JohnD were to pull off that same heist to get the same value in today&#x27;s world, he will need to find a way to transport 2650 pounds or 1.3 tons of cash!<p>Then ask yourself, is $1.2 million enough to get you by today? Surely it will give you a comfortable life but won&#x27;t guarantee that you will be set for life. So, lets put that value at a &quot;small&quot; $5million since you have a plan to live frugally with the stolen cash. Now you will have to find a way to transport 6.5 tons (13,000+ pounds) of cash and not to mention, find a place to hide it!<p>So yep, inflation is the cause of the traditional bank heist being not as popular as it once was.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillinger"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillinger</a>",1453257783

There&#x27;s some meta-data hacking going on in there; but it wasn&#x27;t too difficult to figure it out if you wanted to extend the Django ORM to interface with other databases.<p>In my case, I made an interface to read from ElasticSearch and return Django objects, and store back to ElasticSearch using regular Django objects as well. Since I wasn&#x27;t creating/restoring everything to ES, my library had to create a partial model that&#x27;d look up the rest of the information in Postgres if you touched a field that hadn&#x27;t been stored in ElasticSearch.<p>On the view side though, its not too complex when it comes to request objects, response objects, templates and middleware. Injecting new template engines is fairly straight forward, and the request/response objects are just data objects.<p>However, CBVs are horrible. I never used them. I begun using Django before them, and when they were introduced I tried using it for a month then dropped it entirely. I can see how they can be useful for a CRUD app, or some kind of application where there&#x27;s a lot of code-reuse going on between the functions related to a particular object, but that&#x27;s never been the case for me.<p>I just use functions with decorators for permission & object instantiation from the URL.<p>Django actually hides all of its ugly internals in their form classes.<p>Hardly anyone talks about that because for 90% of the use cases it just works, but the moment you want your form widgets to do something complex, you have to write the forms yourself---in their entirety.<p>I hear that Django 1.9/1.10 is going to give us templates for forms and refactor that code into something sensible.

But today, complex hierachies make it hard to organize and find what we are looking for. The concept of a file being located in a single place seems outdated. Content is stored, synced, backed up and shared among many different devices. And our most important content lives in services or apps, not in folders and files. While mobile devices are trying to kill file management completely, itâs more important today than ever. With the enormous amount and complexity of content, we need a new solution.<p>Okay, buddy. Tell me how you&#x27;re going to navigate a complex project built with multiple apps with your cool new tag-only scheme.<p>How would you re-organize the myriad number of source code files, library sources, images, image source files, readmes, and other things? Hierarchical structures are <i>good</i> for that kind of thing. If you&#x27;re going to advocate throwing them out then I think it is imperative for you to tell me how you will organize <i>real projects</i> rather than just a handwave about search and adding tags to tags. How would I reorganize the directory full of 193 Illustrator art files and a ton of subdirectories, many with multiple layers of their own subdirectories, that make up the graphic novel I finished last year? It&#x27;s got a total of ~2.7k files in it but all of that complexity is hidden behind a bunch of subdirectories so I can quickly find what I need at any moment.<p>(And also: holy crap those sample images are so much WHITE, using this will be like staring into a spotlight. And so impersonal - the user-set desktop picture is a wonderful thing that makes the computer feel like it&#x27;s <i>theirs</i> and I kinda feel like this proposal completely drops affordances like that in favor of a blown-up iPad UI.)",1453256746

Fast integer multiplication is a big part of several useful number-theoretic algorithms. An interesting (to me) application is, for example, to check whether a number is only divisible by small primes. This is an integral part of the most efficient integer factorization algorithms known, and one way to do it is with a product tree followed by a remainder tree [1].

10935568,comment,10935130,10935130,0,0,ggreer,,,"The criticisms here remind me of The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics[1]:<p>> The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics says that when you observe or interact with a problem in any way, you can be blamed for it. At the very least, you are to blame for not doing more. Even if you donât make the problem worse, even if you make it slightly better, the ethical burden of the problem falls on you as soon as you observe it. In particular, if you interact with a problem and benefit from it, you are a complete monster. I donât subscribe to this school of thought, but it seems pretty popular.<p>Microsoft is giving away <i>a billion dollars</i> worth of services, yet people are criticizing them for it. There are several reasons why that&#x27;s unwarranted.<p>First, universities and non-profits don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to choose Microsoft. If they think the risks of lock-in or later expenses will outweigh the donated services, they won&#x27;t pick it. These organizations aren&#x27;t populated by idiots, and Microsoft makes the terms of their deals clear before any contracts are entered. There&#x27;s no coercion or trickery.<p>Second, when it comes to these sorts of discounts, Microsoft is late to the party. AWS gives free stuff to schools and non-profits. Apple has education discounts. People would be outraged if these companies ended these discounts. Yet people are outraged at Microsoft for offering similar discounts. You can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>Third, I seriously doubt that Microsoft is doing this as a purely cynical, profit-seeking move. I can&#x27;t find any mention of a time limit on the free services. Not in Nadella&#x27;s announcement. Not in responses to Q&A. Nowhere. There&#x27;s also the fact that, for the past couple of years, Microsoft has been giving Office 365 away to non-profits and schools. Once they validate your organization (to make sure you&#x27;re not trying to scam them), they give it away, for free, forever. What&#x27;s the ulterior motive there? That people might use it, like it, and pay for it at home or at a different job? That&#x27;s completely unobjectionable.<p>One last point: People like to accuse companies of predatory discounts, but nobody brings up the opposite. What about the countless free-loaders who use as much of a service as they can without paying, then move on to something else? I&#x27;ve seen people brag about using free servers from Rackspace, AWS, and Azure, with no intention of paying those companies a cent. As soon as the discount runs out, they move on. There is little condemnation of these tactics. If anything, many social circles celebrate them. This is a clear double-standard.<p>1. <a href=""http://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethi...</a>",1453255239

As I always say when pricing is raised on HN, no decision you make will have more impact on your profitability.<p>(I also usually link to my review of an <i>entire book devoted to pricing</i>, here it is: <a href=""http://chester.id.au/2012/09/12/review-the-strategy-and-tactics-of-pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chester.id.au/2012/09/12/review-the-strategy-and-tact...</a>)<p>Just think about it. Pricing is a decision that gets made infrequently. It sets the upper bound on potential profitability; whereas costs have in theory no upper bound.<p>People think about costs more because those are hidden from the customer and can be constantly twiddled. But it's meaningless without a smart price structure.<p>Right now I'm working on a little niche web application. What will I be doing in the new year? Well, coding on it, sure.<p>But I will also be getting a new, well-fitted business suit, going out to my customers, and finding how much Problem X is costing them. I'll adjust my pricing scheme to match, because my intention is to capture a fraction of value, not to pluck a number out of the thin air.<p>Seriously.

The Flickr site requires people to pay $25 a year to upload more than 200 photos, and regardless of what you think of premium models, there's intense competition. Flickr itself is stagnant. Years stagnant, we're talking. Features, API integration. I'm really, honestly unsure, even subscribed to their devblog and being a premium customer for 5+ years, what their dev staff are actually doing.<p>I loved Flickr. It's on life support.

Thorium breeders run very close to steady state, and only make a very small fraction of fuel more then they need.<p>2) I'm pretty sure there is a rare reaction that you will get protactinium-232, which has a much shorter half life the protactinium-233 (about a day instead of about a month) but it can't be chemically separated.  It will decay to U-232.<p>The nature article is alarmist, and not practical.  It would only make sense if you had a separate neutron source that was not a thorium breeder, and probably will still have a good amount of U-232.  Since you have a neutron source (probably a light water reactor) why you wouldn't use the extremely well understood methods to make plutonium from U-238 is beyond me.  You quite literally just need to put uranium metal in the neutron flux for 1 month and chemically separate out the plutonium.  Much easier, if I was designing a nuclear weapons program I sure as hell wouldn't pick Thorium.",1355363880

That would simply be a realization of basic market forces and not something Marco can control.<p>However, the bigger issue is that Marco thinks that the editorial <i>format</i> is (one of) the key distinguishers between publications:<p>>>A publications app should be designed and built with purpose and consideration. The Magazine works because I based decisions not on what everyone else was doing, but on what would be best for this magazine. Every publication has its own unique needs, audience, economics, and style, so their apps should reflect that.<p>I don't think this is significant. The value of a publication is its <i>content</i>, primarily, and the creation and selection thereof. Yes, I do think that a general app store creation service should exist for publications, or even several. Should every publication be burdened with re-inventing the wheel for basic webb/app infrastructure? Looking at the web front-end of The Magazine, I see a basic hierarchy of Issue > Article List > Article Preview, which may not be perfect for <i>every</i> publication, but perhaps close enough? Presumably, the app functionality is also close enough to what a large number of publications would need in terms of UX.

Believe it or not, wages do correspond in some way to the amount of benefit an employee brings to a company.<p>Lets say you want to hire someone to clean your house. How much would you have to pay in order to attract someone with enough skill to do the job?  You couldn't just say you'll pay $0.50 per hour and magically get people to clean your house at that rate. There might be some people you'd attract for $5 per hour. As the price goes up, so does the pool of people you could pull from. However, above a certain price, it isn't worth it for you to pay someone else to do it.  You might do it yourself or just live with it being dirty.<p>If having your house cleaned is worth only $5 per hour to you and someone is willing to do house cleaning for $5 per hour should you be allowed to hire them? They probably aren't going to be willing to work for $5 per hour if they can make $10 per hour somewhere else. Does it make sense for the government to say, ""You can't hire this person unless the value they provide is greater than $7.25 per hour""? I don't feel that benefits you or the person who you want to pay. I don't feel it benefits society as a whole because I think we benefit by having money flowing through more hands not fewer. Minimum wage says that transactions below a certain hourly rate are not allowed, so it prevents money from flowing through some of the hands that might get it otherwise.",1355363297

4913638,comment,4905684,4912156,3,0,dalke,,,"I figured you would say that about chickens. Basically, if you pick a definition which only works for humans, then sure, humans are going to be the winner. You might as well say that humans are the most optimal because they are the only ones to have put satellites into orbit around Mars. True, but not a useful species comparison.<p>Tell me, can you even apply your concept of ""wanted to"" to any other species? Which are the most successful fish species by this definition? Could any species of ant ever ""want to"" kill all humans? If they really wanted to, could they succeed?<p>As it stands then, your definition is useless, and propaganda for the supremacy of the humans species.<p>If we go extinct tomorrow - pretend this is the height of the Cold War and WW3 starts, with 50,000 nuclear weapons going off across the surface of the planet - then would an alien observer say that we were a successful species, because of our massive effect on the ecosystem, or would they say that we were a dismal species, which only lasted for a few hundred thousand years?<p>If we go extinct next year because of a hyper-virulent virus which kills only humans, would you say that that virus is more optimal than humans?<p>Your answers probably say more about you than provide a useful guide to how to measure evolutionary success.<p>As to the amount of genetic mutation present, that's just silly. There's 844 million tons of maize harvested each week, with plenty left as chaff. Assuming an average human mass of 65 kg and a population of 7 billion gives 460 million tons of people. Corn DNA is slightly larger than human DNA and plant cells tend to be smaller than animal cells. By the mass or count definition, corn is more successful than humans. There's 651 million tons of wheat harvest each year, but wheat's genome is 5x bigger than humans, so there's certainly more wheat DNA in the world than human DNA.<p>In any case, you're again too focused on the individual. Evolution only cares about genes, not individuals.<p>That's why your correct extrapolation - ""the most optimal human would theoretically attempt to turn all of the matter in the universe into copies of his/her genes"" - shows that that definition of optimality is invalid. Individuals aren't relevant. There's no guarantee that duplicated genes in cloned copies of a single individual are better at survival than having a mix of genes spread across a heterogenous population.<p>And your last paragraph shows that you don't understand the effect of mutation in evolution. All you are thinking of is the weeding out part.<p>Mutations occur all the time. Humans have about 0.003 mutations per genome per generation. For every 4000 births, there is a mutation. Few are improvements. Nearly all have no effect or are negative. Suppose one mutation has a really good advantage, and the only child from that person both 1) inherits the gene and 2) has a <i>brand</i> <i>new</i> nose picking mutation which confers a slight negative effect. Then that person's children will inherit both mutations. The really good one is going to spread, and the new, detrimental mutation <i>will</i> <i>also</i> <i>spread</i> -- even though it doesn't help improve survivability!",1355362469

Curation implies discrimination.<p>Assuming Google is behaving as a rational business, discriminating against nudity means that Google thinks most users don't want nudity in their search results. This may or may not be an accurate assessment of user preferences, but the idea that Google should be ""neutral"" just doesn't make sense.

In all examples, no one tested just one high price point for the item.<p>The story starts out talking about how value is relative to each purchaser, so with different price points you can draw out the more valuable customers with tiered pricing and get more than your original pricing from those who opt in for the higher price point.<p>The glaring omission is not testing just the highest price point. The author explains he didnt want to price out interested readers at lower price points. I don't understand why though. The people who appreciate your value will pay a premium, and others who are not willing to pay a premium, or not really worth having as customers for many reasons, if not for the simple reason that if your goal is to create value, why wouldnt you focus on the areas you can create the most value? There are other reasons I would be glad to share...<p>The strategy of ""comparing apples to oranges"" so you can sell an ebook for $39 instead of $10 is a sound one, but the same strategy could work with only one price point at $179 or even $1700 if the value is there for your audience. In this case, the best comparison would be, ""you can pay $10,000 or more to learn how to develop apps at college, or you can pay a developer $100k a year to develop for you, or you can buy a proven strategy on how to develop apps from me for only $1799.""<p>Would everyone pay? of course not. Would some people pay? All you need is less than 20 for it to be a bigger blockbuster than his original sales.<p>I would personally be shocked if he only had the highest priced point bundle as the only option if he didnt generate much more revenue. Arguably, atleast a few of the people who bought at other price points would come around and spend more.<p>So, this article is absolutely right, draw your customers away from being able to compare your product to other products in the same category, and focus on the value proposition to them... But, dont take his tiered pricing proof as set in stone, odds are it cost him more revenue by doing it than if he didn;t.",1355360952

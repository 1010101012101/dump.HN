560652,comment,560431,560606,0,0,geebee,,,"Dude, I hear you.  But you need to recognize how much abuse and fraud there was and continues to be in these programs.  I agree that there are some idiodic trolls out there, and they're easy enough to refute.  But you should not equate all criticism (even very intense and angry criticism) of this program with this kind of ""idiotic xenophobia"".<p>First, a recent repot on the H1B visa showed that 6 of the top 10 users of this visa were Indian outsourcing companies - using the visa to cycle a worker through the US and then back to India.  Of the remaining four in the top 10, two were US based outsourcing companies.  According to Ron Hira, some of these companies were paying their ""critical workers that couldn't be filled with Americans at any price"" a $12/hr wage!  I don't think it's fair to lump talented engineers with this sort of program, but this is the sort of thing that sounds almost designed to rouse populist anger.  Here you have Microsoft and Google claiming that the cap is too low - but then you see that most of these visas are snapped up by non-US companies that are mainly interested in moving jobs offshore as quickly as possible.  That screams for reform, but instead, the response was always to just lift the cap even higher.<p>People often point out that a high percentage of tech companies have one or more foreign born founder.  Andy Grove and Sergey Brin are often mentioned.  However, these folks didn't come to the United States on a work-related visa.  The US takes over 1.2 million immigrants a year - and many of these folks become founders of tech companies.  To me, this would imply that we <i>don't</i> need an H1B visa to keep the pipeline open - our existing immigration system is already bringing plenty of talented folks here.<p>We need reform, badly.  I think it's very important that the US be open and welcoming to top talent from around the world.  But I think we instituted a program that pretty much enabled employers in the US to fire ordinary US citizens and replace them with ordinary foreign nationals under the guise of bringing in ""Best and brightest.""<p>We need intelligent reform (which should not, in my opinion, amount to unlimited visas for anyone who wants one).  But instead, we may throw the baby out with the bath water.  This is what happens when the powers that be fail to reform an obviously broken system to the point where populist anger takes over.",1239661837

Get to salt, water, flour, and a little yeast; take any of these out, and it's not bread anymore.<p>Now take your bread ""kernel"" and look at the ratio between the ingredients. Go read a bunch of (reputable) bread recipes. You'll find that most reputable bread recipes will be some variation on that core ratio, just like both Linux and FreeBSD have a VFS layer and a system call table.<p>I'm halfway through the book (I'm a fan of Ruhlman's; ""Charcuterie"" sort of changed my life) and while the ability to generate recipes on the fly is a win, I agree with you that it's not revolutionary.

Usually, the top level goal for addictive drug use is to satisfy the addiction.

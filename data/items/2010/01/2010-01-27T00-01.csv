If it's a big city, then everyone who lives in that big city can get direct flights to all of the cities in the network.  This means that you want an airport with tons of runways in the middle of a big city for the most efficient route network.  Thus, you get ORD, DFW, and ATL, all big cities with big airports with lots of parallel runways.

1079305,comment,1078968,1079082,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lua has its own corresponding social quirk: Its designers and community are <i>extremely</i> careful about adding anything to the language that wouldn't be trivially portable or would force any choices when running embedded inside another language/project. Consequently, there are several slightly different threading libraries, several slightly different bignum libraries, etc.<p>On the balance, I'm quite happy with the trade-off (it's strong pressure to keep Lua small, clean, and portable), but it makes using Lua standalone a bit weird. Particularly if you expect it to have ""batteries included"" like Python. It's very powerful combined with C, though, whichever is the primary language.<p>Also, the LuaRocks (<a href=""http://luarocks.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luarocks.org/</a>) project is growing a central, CPAN-ish module repository, which helps.",1264550655

From experience this is especially true for Python: I've used both ctypes and SWIG to turn the guts of existing native programs into Python libraries. I'm sure it's probably the case for Ruby and Perl as well.<p>You could also just use Go by itself :)",1264550576

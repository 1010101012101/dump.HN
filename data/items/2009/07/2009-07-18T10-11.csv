IE's problem was entirely that it was ahead-of-its-time in this regard: fonts were too big on yesterday's internet to download at a decent clip for instant display, and there weren't any open fonts that anyone was interested in using.",1247914796

711648,comment,711561,711561,0,0,mkyc,,,"I think that Martin Fowler hits the nail on the head with Illustrative Programming: ""When you look at a spreadsheet, the formulae of the spreadsheet are not immediately apparent, instead what you see is the calculated numbers - an illustration of what the program does. [...] Using examples as a first class element of a programming environment crops up in other places - UI designers also have this. Providing a concrete illustration of the program output helps people understand what the program definition does, so they can more easily reason about behavior.""[1]<p>Illustrative Programming will fit particularly well with, and benefit from, programs that collect, crunch, and display data - this being area that I agree will see a lot of growth and attention.[2] ""The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades,""[3]<p>Tools that are more suitable for large and complex data sets than Excel, and easier to use than R will become available. These will be used, as many current programming languages are, by people that are not trained in software development. Visualization will become much more important, so programming tool usability will improve. We'll see the influence of statisticians in our programming tools. Chasing down posts by others with similar problems and bugs will become easier. I'm not sure how much headway Illustrative Programming will make into the more hackerish areas of programming, though I hope it's a fair bit. For the best predictions on what languages will be like, just look critically at the languages that are at the start of their lifespans now (<a href=""http://mythryl.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mythryl.org/</a> ? Arc?) and also at current research.<p>I think, though, that the most interesting changes will come from the sort of programs we'll be writing, the sort of people we'll be working with, and the sort of tools we'll have available, rather than from some feature x or y of some future major language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IllustrativeProgramming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IllustrativeProgramming.html</a>

711647,comment,711323,711323,0,0,cesare,,,"The big difference between programmers and non-programmers is that the latter seem to fail to grasp that computers are universal machines/tools. That you can make them do almost anything you want and simulate entire universes inside them. Or use them to solve any kind of problem.<p>How can't you love this?<p>Non programmers, on the other hand, tend to identify the computer with the software already available and known by them.<p>Programming also means (at least ideally) being able to talk directly with the computer. It means being able to perform boring and time consuming tasks in a fraction of the time.<p>Non-programmer users get frustrated so easily with computers because they're in a foreign land and they don't know the language. They can go to the station and take a bus if they know which one would bring them wherever they need to go. But they can't ask for directions.<p>Compare, for instance, the expressiveness of the unix shell with GUIs when you want to perform a specific task on a particular subset of files/data.<p>That's why I think that programming should be something available to (and acknowledged by) every user.",1247914486

Now imagine that large team disbanded and assigned to other projects.  That's the problem of Oracle not supporting it.<p>There is this myth of large open source projects being built collectively by thousands of individual developers in their bedrooms.  It doesn't actually work that way.  MySQL has a large onsite development team that until recently drew their salary from Sun.

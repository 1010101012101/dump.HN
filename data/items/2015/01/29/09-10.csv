8965211,comment,8963710,8963710,0,0,yuchi,,,"-- Attention -- Cross posting from the other thread --<p>Seasoned Appcelerator’s Titanium Mobile SDK dev here. Looks like that a lot of people here is comparing this announcement from the react team to the Titanium Mobile SDK. I’d like to give some info to shed some light on the differences, and probably anticipate the challenges they have to (or had to) solve.<p>## Architecture<p>Both Titanium SDK and this Native React thing do have a JavaScript runtime behind the curtains.<p>Both frameworks will run the JS runtime on the background, on a different thread from the UI. This is incredibly important to remind.<p>Titanium SDK follows an OOP-ish, imperative approach. You create views using factories (`Titanium.UI.createScrollView({ })`) and you add those views to parent views (`parent.add(child)`). This is very similar to a browser DOM, and in fact it’s cumbersome to work with. They built an xml preprocessor called Alloy which does a better job at exposing the view hierarchy right in the source, but it just compiles down to JS, `create()` and `add()`.<p>This is important for the evaluation at least for the following reason: every time you update a property on a view (actually on a proxy object to the real view) you’re crossing the bridge and you have to pay that penality. The bridge is the void between the JS runtime’s thread and the main, UI’s one. This is incredibly painful when trying to do JS animations, sometimes if you’re not careful you can get hurt very badly. You can still do great things, but it’s way better to use the native `.animate()` methods, which cross the bridge only twice (at start, and at the end as a callback invoking).<p>On Native React you should not have this kind of problems because changes will be batched and updated on a update loop basis or at least debounced. Or at least optimized in some smart way. I believe.<p>## Layout<p>One big problem will be the layout. Given that they don’t want the developers to understand every layout system every platform provides, they have to normalize it somehow. Titanium SDK has it’s own layout system, incredibly easy to understand even from a web-only dev experience:<p>a) by default everything is absolute positioned,<p>b) you can get a vertical flow layout by setting the &#x27;layout&#x27; property on the parent view or<p>c) you can get a horizontal flow (inline-block-ish) by setting &#x27;layout&#x27; to horizontal.<p>Native React will probably follow a more intimately web-ish approach, just look at this JS/C/Java implementation of the box-model and flex-box specification by Facebook itself [1]<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/css-layout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/css-layout</a><p>## Support and limits<p>Titanium SDK is always criticized for being to limited in what you can do with it. This actually comes from two different issues:<p>1) they have to (almost) manually implement every API you might need, by proxying from native-land to JS-land;<p>2) they have to follow every release of the platform’s SDK;<p>3) you cannot just put native code along-side your JS code, so you cannot go where they didn’t.<p>Let’s see how Native React will solve this issue.<p>Titanium SDK is undergoing an heavy lifting refactoring to solve exactly this issues. The project is code-named Hyperloop and is already working behind the curtains for the Windows 8 version of the SDK.<p>## Conclusion<p>Because I shamelessy want to karma-drift this topic, I’ll stop here.<p>It’s interesting, but until they show us some (native) code... it’s just ideas.<p>Follow me on twitter (@_pier) and github (@yuchi [2]) for Titanium related stuff.<p>Also my company, SMC, does a lot of great opensource things for Titanium (on gh we’re @smclab)<p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/yuchi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yuchi</a>",1422525582

8965209,comment,8963069,8963902,0,0,72deluxe,,,"That&#x27;s a good point. The net is great for shoving data backwards and forwards but for the web it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the browser should be expected to do EVERYTHING.<p>There used to be a time when most of the posts here on HN were &quot;something native IMPLEMENTED IN JavaScript in a BROWSER&quot; but thankfully those times have passed to the most part.<p>The Internet was heralded as solving cross-platform problems (hurray for XML?) but it seems that writing a native app actually involves less testing. You now have to test in 3 or 4 browsers per platform, not including mobile devices and changes between different versions. The relentless shoving of features into browsers is no different to what they&#x27;ve been doing for years but I can see why people would not enjoy it, particularly with the repeat of &quot;only works in IE&quot; that you see (&quot;only works in Chrome&quot;).",1422525447

Yes, if you were selling drugs on Silk Road you were less likely to get into a violent confrontation with a client. Yes, if you were buying drugs on Silk Road you were less likely to get into a violent confrontation with the dealer. But the claim here is that Silk Road also dramatically reduced barriers to entry for both buyers and sellers for very serious drugs.<p>Heroin is no joke and no amount of pseudo-libertarian drug legalization arguments make it any safer. If Silk Road made it available to a dramatically broader audience that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have been able to get it, the harm to society, on balance, must have been enormous.<p><i>> The whole ordeal here just drives the point home, that the drug war is not at all about harm reduction for anybody, not users, certainly not dealers, and not even society at large.</i><p>Heroin isn&#x27;t weed.

More importantly - the result of these computations aren&#x27;t given to the JS environment in a synchronous manner. You can&#x27;t read/write/read/write style properties/computations and inadvertently trigger more reflows than necessary. I&#x27;ve seen that pattern make web experiences unusable. In React Native, reads must be done asynchronously, and they are batched together for efficiency. Not only is this one major footgun that React Native takes away, but the asynchronous nature also means that style computation (layout primarily) can be done in a different &quot;pipeline&quot; stage, which opens up future opportunity to parallelize that work with JS execution.",1422522911

In a spin or stall &#x27;aiming for an empty patch&#x27; is, essentially, not possible, as the control surfaces of the plane are not usable due to reduced airflow. Additionally, in IMC (Instrument Meterological Conditions), it&#x27;s not possible to see a safe landing spot. This is an ideal use case for a parachute, but if the plane breaks away as you say, the remainder of the plane will land in an unpredictable location.<p>There&#x27;s also the increased complexity involved with ensuring all flight control and avionics connectors between the cabin and body of the plane break away reliably and quickly when the parachute is deployed, and never break away otherwise.<p>In short, adding a breakaway cabin might make the pilot safer (but might not, given the additional complexity for breakaway avionics and flight controls), but it puts more risk on the public at large when deployed, so it&#x27;s understandable why such a system was never developed (with the possible notable exception of military ejection seats).",1422522842

I was raised with de Balzac, Hugo, Dumas, Molière, Verne, Voltaire, etc. (My Petit Larousse 89 saved me).<p>I read Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot; and Descartes &quot;Discours de la Méthode&quot; as a teenager. (blows the mind)<p>Reading in high-school ranged from Freud and Adler, to Nietzsche, Hume, Socrates and Marcus Aurelius. To Dostoïevsky and Ostrovski. To Bandler/Grinder/Dilts/Erickson...<p>I speak 5 languages fluently (on a daily basis), read a book or two, and I&#x27;m never sick at sea.<p>How many &#x27;occidental philosophers&#x27; have you read? Don&#x27;t take that patronizing route. I may seem to have a great sense of drama, but the art of disguising a slap as an advice is being lost.<p>If there was someone who loves French culture and art, it&#x27;d be me.. And this has nothing to do with France specifically.<p>This is about Governments (any, including ours) giving lame, unconvincing justifications. In other words: &quot;You can try to screw me, but when you say it&#x27;s for my own good, at least make it convincing&quot;..<p>>I think you should read occidental philosophers a bit more, starting with socrate and aristotle, as well as history books written by objective historians, because many of your points either reduct to logical fallacies or gross exagerations...<p>>You seem to have a personnality attracted by absolute / binary things and a great sense of drama, so reading a bit of greek discussions will probably help you see that things aren&#x27;t black and white and cool down a bit. As for french culture specifically, a bit of Voltaire and Rousseau will be a good start, because what you look as &quot;prextexts and hypocrisies&quot; are probably the kind of subtle reasoning that would let your country be in not such a miserable state.",1422522685

The first is whether you&#x27;re compliant with well-defined local regulations for the jurisdictions you are within, as well as any industry specific regulations you&#x27;re under (think Finance). For example, the specific regulations for employee email are <i>substantially</i> different in the UK, Germany and USA.<p>The point you&#x27;re making is whether &#x27;state actors&#x27; can get into your documents or email. It&#x27;s a different order of magnitude issue. First, as a company you&#x27;re going to comply with whatever the law is in the jurisdiction. Second, if you&#x27;re being attacked by a state actor then you&#x27;ve got major issues.

I thought I was a scoop.<p>It has taken me 12 months to find a job, and that job is not in Australia.<p>Of the 7 friends I went through uni with (including myself) that completed, three found local jobs in their field, three founds jobs overseas and one took a PhD to duck and cover from the economy.<p>When it&#x27;s as difficult to find jobs in the country as it is to get them overseas, you can hardly froth over how it&#x27;s a problem that Australian IT demand isn&#x27;t being met because students aren&#x27;t interested.<p>Not our fault arseholes, maybe if you hired someone occasionally, people would consider it more of a career option.<p>The reality is that the Australian IT industry is dead, dead, dead. There is no startup culture anywhere, almost every games company abandoned ship during the GFC, and big companies like Microsoft ship Australian graduates to the US rather then employing them here. The jobs that stay in Australia are two-faced. One of the guys I mentioned got a local job with HP, and a few months later he was handing out fliers at the job faire for the next years graduates.<p>HP sure must value his technical expertise, and they aren&#x27;t the only ones. Cisco was advertising for engineers (electrical, software, computer) for their graduate program. Upon further inspection, the first 6 months of their graduate program involved coursework in sales.<p>COME ON. I did not do 4 years of university to hawk routers.<p>Why is this shit happening?

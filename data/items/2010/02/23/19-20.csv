1146217,comment,1145917,1145995,0,0,acid_bath,,,"> in the short term it's going to require building versions of sites specifically for them.<p>Or re-think their design choices in the first place (which is of course building a new version, but perhaps not specifically for touchscreens).<p>1 - Links should look like links.  If I have to move my mouse around to figure out which part I click or if it's clickable at all, it's a failure.  I shouldn't monitor my status bar or watch my mouse curser for a change.  I'm not saying everything should be underlined or something, but make clickable things look like clickable things in whatever way is intuitive for the given site.<p>2 - Hover to navigate.  Get rid of it.  Find a way to make the click action do the same thing.  I abhor menu systems that require a series of mouseovers to get to the clickable element.  If I move my mouse a bit too far it disappears, or FSM-forbid if I don't even know that I'm supposed to be able to just hold my mouse over it to do an action.  Also: Javascript required.<p>The above may not apply to flash widgets, so that's understandable.  But even some of the complaints in the linked article could be fixed with a better UI:<p>""Video players where the controls appear on mouseover and hide otherwise."" - OH NO! Maybe do what every app does already: tap once to show controls, fade away after no clicks within a window.  Is that hard?<p>""Menus that popup up subpage links when you mouse over a main button, vs. going directly to a main category page when you click."" See #2.<p>""Buttons that have important explanations/summaries on mouseover, which you need to understand before deciding what to click.""  This is relatively valid, but again, make your UI cleaner or more intuitive and this problem solves itself.  Look at game controllers for consoles: do they have tooltips?<p>""Functions that use mouseover to preview and click to commit; such as choosing hair colors for an avatar: you mouse over the colors until your character looks the way you like, and then you click to commit.""<p>Hover becomes a click.  Make a separate submit button. Done. Please hire me, I'm apparently an exceptional UI engineer.<p>... Anyway, I'm not saying there wouldn't be issues of someone took an existing for-desktop flash app and tried to run it on a touchscreen. Most wouldn't work. That being said, is it really so hard to come up with a UI that doesn't require mouse-hovers?<p>Is it impossible for Adobe to conceive of their product ever working on something without a mouse?  That when the mouse-n-curser paradigm is phased out (and eventually it will be) that Adobe is going to close shop because there's just <i>no</i> way to do Flash w/ touchscreens?<p>I doubt it.",1266954162

1146131,comment,1145648,1145648,0,0,mixmax,,,"Here's a related take on why there are no more women in startups from an evolutionary perspective.<p>In reproduction, which is what evolution is made of, men and women are very different. A  woman can only have one baby every nine months, and realistically maybe every other year. This limits her choices for reproduction so she has to find the right man for the job meaning someone that has the resources to take care of the kid and make sure he grows up and has offspring. Men on the other hand can reproduce as much as they like given they can find a willing woman. This has some interesting consequences on evolutionary selection.<p>- Women are risk averse and look for security, knowing that they only have a few shots at successful propagation.<p>- Since men can have many women, but women can have only one man (a women with many men will not produce more offspring, but a man with many women will) the offspring of the men will be unequally divided. The bottom of the pack won't have any offspring at all while the top of the pack will have a lot. Ghengis Khan had lots of children with many wives, and so do people with harems. This means there are men that have no offspring at all.<p>- Women look for men that can take care of their offspring. They care more about them since they have fewer chances than men do. This is why women go for rich men, and why only rich men have harems.<p>What this means is that a woman is somewhat guaranteed to find a man that she can produce offspring with if she is conservative in her choices, and that she will tend to mate with the most successful man she can find. Men, on the other hand, don't have this guarantee and have to play a risky game of trying to make it to the top. The more success a man has the more women will want to mate with him. On the other hand if he is conservative there's a risk he won't find anyone to mate with at all thus ending his gene pool.<p>I think this combined with Patrick's post explains pretty clearly why there are no more women in Silicon Valley. It's simply too risky.",1266952538

Some people want Silicon Valley to be more demographically diverse for reasons of justice; but they would not feel comfortable if that diversity led to moral diversity.

Sure, all of those components could be rewritten so at least relationships like ""above"" and ""beside"" and ""touching"" could be queried.

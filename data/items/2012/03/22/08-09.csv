The concept of ""looking good"" in western society is equivalent to ""looking sexy/desiderable to the opposite sex"". Why would women's skirts emphasize one's ass otherwise? When in a suit/tailleur (pardon me, I'm not a tailor), it's among the most professional attires a woman can wear, and it's been sexualized to high heaven. Why? Because it makes women feel powerful. And why do they feel powerful? Because they can attract men, and that's what society tells them their power should be.<p>So whoever tells herself that she wants to look good ""to feel better"" is, unconsciously, accepting sexism in society almost as much as one who'd crack a joke about it; she's just doing at a much deeper level, one which women still refuse to deal with (it would mean dropping the whole ""fashion"" industry like a hot potato).",1332406250

""Why do women wear low-cut dresses if not to attract male attention?""<p>Women wear low cut dresses because they feel good in them, because they feel they look good in them. Showing off your breasts, if you consider them an attractive part of you, is like showing off your face, or arms, or legs. This question is like asking, ""Why do women brush their hair, if not to attract male attention?"" Feeling good gives you confidence, and that confidence occurs internally, not because a man can give you external validation of sexual appeal. (My cleavage  may turn you on, but it doesn't turn me on, or make me feel sexual just because it's there.)<p>Women rarely get dressed with men in mind, and it's fascinating to me that men think otherwise.<p>And similarly, feeling good about oneself is not equivalent to feeling sexually attractive. And having someone point out my sexuality all day long, when it's not even on my mind, is extremely uncomfortable, invasive, and (for lack of a less cliched term, apologies in advance) objectifying.",1332404560

3738870,comment,3736037,3736037,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Reading through the article and the comments here it seems to me that there is a tremendous unresolved tension.  There seems to be an idea that we just 'fix the sexism' and that's that.   However, stepping back and asking harder questions makes me think the problems are fundamental to highly developed capitalist economies.  Before you mod  me down, at least read the rest of what I have to say.<p>Everything we do-- what we wear, how we walk, the way we talk, sends subtle social signals, and these impact all areas of life.  Two fundamental (and increasingly entwined) areas of life are sexuality (without which our race dies out) and economic (without which, each of us dies individually).  These are tremendously entertwined, with over half of Americans having dated co-workers (see: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/02/10/the-state-of-the-office-romance-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/02/10/the-state-...</a>).<p>So it seems to me that, particularly single, women navigating the modern workplace are trying to navigate two fundamentally conflicting desires.  The first is to be professional and not be open to the problem of being offered promotions for sexual favors, or retaliation for declining such offers, and the second is to find romance, companionship, love, etc.  The fact that workplace romances are so common cannot be discounted in this area.<p>And so you have two key questions:<p>1)  How do you define appropriate boundaries?  This is a hellishly difficult problem in the context of the workplace.<p>2)  If boundaries aren't bright but involve a lot of give and take, then doesn't that fundamentally mean that there will be a lot of behavior that will fall outside of that which is desirable?<p>I honestly don't see how you solve that problem.<p>On the gender role issue, I am a firm believer that one is generally better off making such tasks as taking notes or arranging potlucks things which are volunteer, and then if that fails, rotated, eliminating those who can't do it reasonably well.<p>But beyond that........  As long as so much of our social spheres surround work, and that's where a lot of opportunity for dating (both for men and women) lies, I just don't buy that you can wish away unwanted attention.",1332403844

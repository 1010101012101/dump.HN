89943,comment,89055,89055,0,0,wumi,,,"One of the basic problems with this whole discussion, is that most are thinking like Americans: that everywhere in the world is like where we are now.<p>If you go to any lesser-developed countries they are not entrenched in ""google"" or ""facebook"" or anything for that matter because they don't have computers --but they do have mobile phones.<p>Everybody's talking about China & India, great. But what about the many nations on the African Continent? In five to ten years, countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, etc. will be the new technological and economical hotbeds.",1197755637

89939,comment,89917,89917,0,0,joshwa,,,"Surf already exists-- it's called behavioral targeting. Of course, no one (not even facebook) is stupid enough to directly report this information back to the user or the user's friends, except in the form of targeted ads. <p>Image Scan actually sounds like a pretty good business plan-- once again, for ad targeting. Although there are some quality issues--- do you really want your ad showing next to someone burning one of your shoes, or a picture of a sweatshop worker?<p>Locate-- facebook might not be working on it, but google definitely is. <p>Diary-- livejournal. fb notes. 'nuff said.<p>Receipt-- Beacon on crack. Marketers have been chasing the holy grail of tracking customers purchases across all channels. If you've ever given a ""source code"" or ""catalog code"" when ordering from a paper catalog, that's what you're doing. Cross-channel microtargeting is the future! <p>One wonders if the credit card processors are doing the kinds of under-the-table clickstream-data types of deals that the ISPs are doing.",1197755080

New stuff is appended to the bottom, so I can tell how old an idea by where it is on the page.<p>A lot of stuff never actually gets done (sometimes the idea no longer makes sense or isn't important in light of new ones), but I think the big advantage is getting the stuff out of your head. There is a lot of mental effort involved in holding on to several ideas at once. If you write them down, you don't have to constantly keep them in mind, so you can focus on actually doing something.",1197755035

89934,comment,89888,89888,0,0,acgourley,,,"If Snocap failed to turn a profit, it isn't because the margins for music are slim, it is because they failed to run their business lean enough. All they had to do was provide a profile widget and market it. From the sound of the article, they were trying to do a lot more, and their overhead was too high. <p>It's too bad - I really like Snocap, often times its the only way for me to buy non-drm music electronically from smaller artists.",1197753280

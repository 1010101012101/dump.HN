There is not good evidence to suggest this is causative however--this may be, for example, that as you get to higher frequencies of cases differently aged people are more likely to be infected and show different viral loads. A direct causal link between these two factors doesn&#x27;t make a huge amount of sense, because (AFAIK) HIV is thought to sample all viral sequences within each host (so population-level selection should represent individual-level variation).",1417521259

Practical principles, like the agile manifesto, describe a preferred trade-off rather than just naming a good attribute like swiftness, because who doesn&#x27;t want the good attribute?

8686656,comment,8683015,8684215,0,0,pascal_cuoq,,,"Replying for masklinn, perhaps what they had in mind was the discovery of optimizations that are not allowed by strict aliasing rules. Consider:<p><pre><code>    int *p, *q, x;\n    ...\n    memmove(p, q, 50 * sizeof(int));\n    p[2] = 3;\n    q[3] = 4;\n    x = p[2];\n</code></pre>\nIn the example above, it is illegal (with only the information available) to optimize the last assignment to x = 3. Strict aliasing does not apply because everything is int.<p>If the call to memmove were a call to memcpy instead, a sufficiently creative compiler author could argue that the optimization of the last statement to x = 3 is legal, because the call to memcpy asserts (among other things) that the int pointed by p+2 does not have any bit in common with the int pointed by q+3.<p>I don&#x27;t know how often that would trigger or how useful that would be. But I work on a system in which C programs can be annotated with properties (including non-aliasing properties: see <a href=""http://blog.frama-c.com/index.php?post/2012/07/25/On-the-redundancy-of-C99-s-restrict"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.frama-c.com/index.php?post/2012/07/25/On-the-red...</a> and <a href=""http://blog.frama-c.com/index.php?post/2012/07/25/The-restrict-qualifier-as-an-element-of-specification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.frama-c.com/index.php?post/2012/07/25/The-restri...</a> ), and that makes me pretty confident that this would be sound and, unlike a joke I made two years ago about the redundancy of restrict in C99, workable.",1417520713

A lot of the heat they suffer from is generated internally.\nAnother way of dealing with the problem is to use the heat pumps to dump the heat into water to use for washing and process heat instead of just throwing it away.\nAs far as I can see the mirror is exactly the same idea as a window air-conditioner except more efficient, that is, it simply moves the problem elsewhere.\nStill, as a component in a system of measures to control temperature it sounds like a good idea.",1417520680

8686649,comment,8677556,8678738,0,0,jbergens,,,"I agree that the project size (LOC and usage) matters a lot and that small projects could use almost any language. I don&#x27;t agree that everything i linear. A project with 10 times the LOC is not just 10 times harder to build, it might be anywhere from 20-100 times harder. For example, 10 000 LOC is possible for a developer to read and remember quite well, 100 000 LOC is much harder and takes longer to read. 1 million LOC is probably really, really hard to read and understand (especially when we are talking about old code with a lot of cruft and possibly multiple changes in the design over time).\nSo for a small code base that happens to have millions of users you should probably go for a fast language and take the time to optimize a lot. For a large code base with very few users you should probably use an expressive language and don&#x27;t care about performance.

To me, ownership signifies that a certain person is aware of the history of a particular area of code, is responsible for keeping it in good shape and is usually the go-to person for all modification, or at least code reviews all work done to the code.<p>This does not mean that they should be the only one who understands it and has the ability to modify it.<p>I think we both agree that the understanding of the code should be dispersed, so that any other employee can get up to speed with the code just in case the prior owner exits the organization.<p>I&#x27;m working at an organization that some parts of which do development in the &quot;share all&quot; mentality and some of which try to maintain code ownership in the way I described. The code ownership strategy seems to work much better, but, YMMV as always.<p>When the code ownership is not made explicit, actually there can develop pockets of &quot;accidental ownership&quot; even in the &quot;share all&quot; codebase. Something that only one person has ever touched, and who does all the modifications because all the organization needs is a tiny, quick tweak, and the codebase is already a hot mess after endless amount of these &quot;quick tweaks&quot;.<p>&quot;I really, really wanted to believe that good design mattered, that somehow it had intrinsic value. Sad thing is, it doesn&#x27;t. BeOS failed. Plan9 failed. Inferno failed. Transmeta failed. Sun and SGI failed. Smalltalk failed. Lisp failed. Erlang failed&quot;<p>Those all are large scale systems, so I cannot speak for them.<p>However, in the scale of day to day coding, I&#x27;ve usually attempted applying good design to all of my prodcution code and usually the only feedback I&#x27;ve got from my way of working has been positive. I&#x27;ve shipped on time and the bugcount (for all I know) has been low.<p>So, based on my experience, I really cannot concur with you.<p>Perhaps our experience from software development is from a completely different business area. Professionally I specialize in performance critical C and C++, 8 years and counting so perhaps I&#x27;ve not been long enough in the field just yet to witness the fail of good design.",1417520092

8686601,comment,8683827,8684973,0,0,lmm,,,"> I threw together a form builder by re-purposing old code from a side project that took me two years to polish. My proof of concept let an admin change guidance on the fly, without touching HTML. Fields could be re-sequenced, data types changed. Business rules could be linked to fields dynamically, and applied to single fields or entire form sections. Data was saved to a SQL Server (already in wide use in the estate). My proof of concept took 4 weeks, and on the basis of that I estimated a 6 month project. When I presented the idea it was viewed as being too complex, and therefore too risky.<p>Was your flexibility in the right direction? I could tell you exactly the opposite horror story, where an enterprise architect built in a bunch of flexibility that we never used, but we still spent a load of time changing everything as the customer requirements changed. Only we had to spend twice as long because we had to change everything in three places because the &quot;flexible design&quot; required that.<p>> Of course soon after the customer decided that the guidance for the printed form wasn&#x27;t appropriate for the online version. And of course the customer wanted to analyse data across all forms. What was a 6 month piece of work took 3 years. And still no ability to analyse data nested in Mongo documents. Any change requires hours of re-work, regression tests and sign-off.<p>Why would your way have been different? If you are using the database to store logic in, it&#x27;s still logic and still needs the same level of testing as it does in code. And you don&#x27;t get existing tools like VCS, release systems, staging environments to help you with that.<p>I know we&#x27;re just comparing anecdotes, but everywhere I&#x27;ve worked the business effectiveness has been directly proportional to the extent to which they actually followed the agile principles.",1417519328

That casting a float to an int to do some bit twiddling is now undefined behavior of the sort that technically entitles the compiler have it&#x27;s way with your root filesystem.  Although usually it will just let you off with a warning and a gaping hole where your null checking code used to be.<p>Believe it or not, memcpy() is now the only portable and properly defined way to cast one type to another in C. You are expected to use it with the explicit intent that no bytes actually be copied, simply as a (completely voluntary) offering to the type gods.  If they accept your offering, the call will just disappear from your code, and never be made.  If you fail to make this offering, they feel entitled to excise an equal quantity of other code to punish you.<p>Sure, you the programmer happen to know that bits are bits, and that on your system they are already in the register you want to use, but the compiler stopped playing that game years ago.  If you wanted to work close to the metal, you should have chosen a language more appropriate for the task.  There&#x27;s a great discussion of the issues in this epic comp.arch thread: <a href=""http://compgroups.net/comp.arch/if-it-were-easy/2993157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compgroups.net/comp.arch/if-it-were-easy/2993157</a><p>Search for the first occurence of &#x27;memcpy&#x27;, where you&#x27;ll find a polite but beleaguered Terje Mathisen asking for the best way to portably cast a float to an integer in C.  Then keep searching forward for further occurrences of memcpy as the situation becomes surreal, with a GCC maintainer Mike Stump eventually clearing things up:<p><pre><code>  >>> So what is the blessed method?\n  >>\n  >> Just memcpy it, simple sweet, fast, standard.\n  >\n  >So what you are saying is that memcpy() isn&#x27;t just magic but high magic:\n\n  No.  What I think I&#x27;m saying is that it is standard.  See the quoted\n  text above.  The word magic [ checking ] doesn&#x27;t not occur in c99-tc3.\n  What is defined in that standard is memcpy, it is as standard as if,\n  which is also defined.\n\n  >It looks like a function call but can be whatever the compiler wants it \n  >to be, as long as the results behave as if the data was actually copied.\n  >:-)\n\n  No, you fail to grasp the totality of the standard.   The implementation \n  is free to do _anything_ it wants.  The only constraint is that the user \n  can&#x27;t figure that it deviated from the required semantics by using a standards\n  defined mechanism for figuring it out.  We call this the as-if rule, and its\n  power is awesome; we could destroy the universe, and repiece it back together\n  one subatomic particle at a time over a billion years, and still be compliant,\n  if we wanted.\n</code></pre>\nSo there you have it:  if you want to reuse the exact contents of a register as a different type in a way that you know will work, the correct approach is to use memcpy() to copy the data from one variable to another, and then hope without confirmation that GCC has optimized out the call to make it equivalent to a simple cast.<p>If you want a better understanding of the GCC mindest, the rest of Mike&#x27;s posts are excellent:  cutting, extremely techically accurate, and (in my opinion) completely missing the point of why some people are unhappy with the direction that C is evolving.",1417519266

They also double as wireless APs - can that functionality be disabled in favour of a customer&#x27;s own APs?<p>Edit: Did some research, seems it needs IGMP proxying, which should be doable on a decent router. <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/gj6guphe4bc8k4t/GoogleFiberRouterGuide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/gj6guphe4bc8k4t/GoogleFiberRouterG...</a> was a very useful link.",1417518599

There is a lot of cultural belief that creativity comes from inspiration, and can&#x27;t be rushed. Not true. Inspiration is just your subconscious putting things\ntogether, and that can be made into an active process with a little introspection. Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and\njust keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you aren&#x27;t sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better.&quot; - John Carmack",1417518375

Plenty of industries have a de-facto standard file format that&#x27;s basically text, but with some special command sequences or bracketing (e.g. recently I had someone ask me how to read &quot;PGN&quot; files, which turns out to be the standard way of recording chess games). Chess is a trivial example, but the &quot;STL&quot; format used by a CNC milling machine I&#x27;ve worked with is a pretty similar format.<p>So imagine I wanted to write a &quot;middleware&quot; piece for that milling machine - maybe it has a slight defect where its width measure isn&#x27;t exactly the same as its depth measure (I expect modern machines automatically recalibrate themselves, but you can imagine weirder problems that this might not solve). Then I could write a program that would rescale models exported from a CAD application to match the weirdness of my particular machine, by reading the file, making the adjustments, and writing a new file.<p>For a less industrial example that I&#x27;ve actually done, I worked on a fan translation of a videogame. The scripts were, of course, in a weird format that the original makers came up with, with no publicly available libraries. So I wrote a parser that could separate the actual text lines from the timing information and so forth, allowing the translators to translate.",1417518340

Why (outside of a monopolistic or otherwise non competitive market) would an employee who is delivering a lot of value based <i>solely on their contribution</i> chose to work for significantly less than that value.<p>Clearly there needs to be some profit for their employer, but, using my example of a lawyer - there are thousands of law firms, and if a Lawyer is capable of driving $500K/of billable value, based solely on their effort - why would they chose to work for $50K when they could go to another law firm and work for $100K (or $150K, etc...)<p>I&#x27;m using an extreme example, but the same concept applies elsewhere.<p>The reasons I can think of why a person might not do this:<p>o Lack of information - the employee may not realize how much value their effort drives.<p>o Monopoly for the purchaser of their services - they may work in a niche field, in which their is only one purchaser for their service.",1417518278

From there on in, you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> any other tools.  It just uses VCS for package management.

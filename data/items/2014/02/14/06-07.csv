7237334,comment,7236411,7237006,1,0,grey-area,,,"This is a great film, but I&#x27;m not sure why knowing more about the plot or the background to the design would ruin it for you? Do you also worry about spoilers for works of literature or films from the past? What about spoilers for young people on the entirety of human output?<p>I agree everyone should go watch this film, as it was really fascinating and a probably far more realistic take on living in space than most - the boredom, paranoia and drudgery were very effective - I feel compelled to stop discussing it here though in case I violate your no spoilers rule!  I think I&#x27;ll watch it again sometime, and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy it more, not less, having read some of the discussion here and knowing more about it, and having seen all the twists of the plot already. Those are the least enjoyable and least important parts of the enjoyment of the film, and a focus on them omits all the other fascinating parts of this story (the repetition, the model-making as a way of escape, the corporation that controls his life, the convincing drudgery of space etc).<p>If you really don&#x27;t like spoilers, don&#x27;t click on discussions which purport to be about the film until you see it, or stop reading them as soon as the film is mentioned. That&#x27;s really the only solution for you, and more effective than calling for no spoilers. Where did this recent obsession with spoilers come from?<p>A great story should not need the prop of plot-twists to be enjoyable - there are so many facets of entertainment which don&#x27;t depend on plot (character, narration, allusions, themes, language, even setting and typography as here!). Stories like The Odyssey or Julius Caesar are not ruined by knowing the plot, because the pleasure is in the telling (and sometimes the retelling) and worrying over spoilers shuts down any sort of significant discussion of a film or story. To me shutting down all that discussion is far more damaging than any potential loss of momentary surprise when something happens you didn&#x27;t expect.",1392361109
7237333,comment,7234855,7234855,1,0,mercurial,,,"> Another example is the Config object. When I started the Python code back in 2005, I was very excited about using the idea of dependency injection for connecting together software modules (this is the basis of how 0install runs programs). Yet, for some reason I can’t explain, it didn’t occur to me to use a dependency injection style within the code. Instead, I made a load of singleton objects. Later, in an attempt to make things more testable, I moved all the singletons to a Config object and passed that around everywhere. I wasn’t proud of this design even at the time, but it was the simplest way forward.<p>That&#x27;s called a &quot;god object&quot;, unless I&#x27;m mistaken. It&#x27;s an abomination in any language.

7237317,comment,7233001,7237121,2,0,lunchbox,,,"> <i>Chinese characters are not an alphabet, they do not carry phonetics, they carry meaning. And, guess what, this is arguably better. Why? Because phonetics tend to shift quickly.</i><p>But I would think (and remember reading somewhere) that phonetics shift more quickly where there is no written record of the pronunciation. Chinese has dozens of mutually unintelligible dialects (Mandarin, Wu, Cantonese, Hakka, etc.). Maybe this fragmentation would be much less if they had a phonetic writing system in the first place.<p>> <i>In a few decennies any spoken language has shifted, vocalisation is different, especially when the language is used by loosely coulped communities. And then you have to adapt spelling to new pronunciations. But what do you do with old books? And how do you keep the language united?</i><p>English (or Spanish, etc) is a real-world example of a mostly phonetic writing system, and I don&#x27;t think it is that bad. We can still read old texts, even though our pronunciation of the words has changed vastly. If you go back far enough (e.g. to the time of Chaucer in the 1300s), it becomes hard to understand what is being said, but practically speaking I don&#x27;t see this as a big problem. In contrast, I think it&#x27;s very important to have a writing system that is easily learned, so that it is accessible to the entire population (not just those able to invest lots of time & effort).",1392360759

We ended up paying a few hundred $ per month for a web and db server that were just barely usable in terms of speed.<p>Compare that to a box i can get for EUR 50 over at Hetzner that alone is multiple times faster than the 2 small AWS vms . Need another one ? Will be provisioned in about an hour...don&#x27;t need an instance anymore ? Cancel it by the end of the month, no long term contracts.\nYes there is a one-time fee for setting up a new box, but thats about it.\nAnd you don&#x27;t believe how far you can get with a proper beefy 2, maybe 3 machine setup..For EUR 150 you get power equivalent to spending >1000 on AWS easily.<p>Today AWS to me only makes sense for short term computing projects or something very time limited (eg <4weeks) or if money simply doesn&#x27;t matter.

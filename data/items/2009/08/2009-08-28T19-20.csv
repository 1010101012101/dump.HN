792130,comment,791790,791945,0,0,pyre,,,"> <i>EDIT: To the reply about the 15 year old giving a blowjob to a classmate, read the subjective part again, sometimes the punishment doesn't fit the crime, especially when you consider two minors, I'm addressing the adult indecent behavior, not the minors with minors, that's a parenting problem in my eyes.</i><p>The problem is that you're not addressing 'adults with indecent behavior.' And even then, what is 'indecent behavior?' Pissing on a wall when you're drunk? Are you really and truly afraid of that person molesting your child? If so then you have serious issues...<p>> <i>I hope to know about it. I don't care how minuscule the crime is, the possibility of repeat offenses or misbehavior is too high to risk it.</i><p>This right here says that you're not concerned with 'is the punishment too harsh.' ""I don't care how minuscule the crime is,"" says that you don't give a shit about people that were too harshly punished. You would rather just brand people as 'good' or 'bad' and then avoid the 'bad' people.  Sorry, but the world doesn't work that way. There are many shades of gray.<p>> <i>any inappropriate behavior around children (impressionable, gullible, naive) should be punished.</i><p>The problem is that 'inappropriate' is subjective too. You're saying that the harshness of the punishment is subjective, so it can be ignored, but the 'inappropriateness' of the crime is paramount... only that's also a subjective measure.<p>> <i>If a person shows that kind of poor judgment they should suffer the consequences of their actions.</i><p>So a person that pissed on a wall should have all of society treat him exactly the same as a person that spent a lifetime raping 7 year olds.  Not only that, but someone that was 18 and had sex with someone that was 17 years old should be treated the same as someone that kidnaps 12 year olds and tortures them to death... You're a pretty vicious person.<p>{edit} Just to add, that someone that was convicted of raping a woman isn't necessarily a 'danger' to your child either. Even the people that 'deserve' to be on the sex offender list aren't necessarily all there for  the same reason. {/edit}",1251489009

It certainly wasn't when I got the paycheck or got a new job with better pay, or bought a new car, or bought second laptop.</i><p>Looking back at <i>my</i> life, I find that this is exactly opposite for me.  Every period in my life that I was really happy, I had just gotten or was still in a high-paying job, had low stress and no worries (because of the aforementioned good job), was able to buy a new car or new laptop, etc.<p>Most years of my life, I made less than 20K, and the happy times were (and are, because I'm damn happy right now) all above 50K.",1251486315

PowerSet launched with just being able to search Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is a highly, highly structured body of text that is much, much easier for NLP and semantic technology to analyze.  Taking the same technology to the garbled soup that is the web is a whole different ballgame.",1251486222

It seems to be the result of an imperfection in our political system. In certain communities, any legislation that would increase the scope of sex offender laws, no matter how senseless, will be met with support. And given the nature of sound-byte journalism these days, it's politically impossible to oppose one of these laws and still be reelected.<p>I think drunk driving is another example of the same pattern. We've ratcheted down the blood alcohol content limit to 0.08% in most places (generally equivalent to a couple of drinks) yet there are habitual offenders still on the road. I had a friend get hit head on by a drunk driver with 8 DUI's.<p>In both cases the focus should be on dealing with the serious offenders swiftly and severely and not on maximizing the number of infractions.",1251486162

We once had a developer working for us who in 1992 had a server that was unsecure and someone was sending kiddy-porn via it.

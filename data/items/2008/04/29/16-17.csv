There should be a way to note questions during the interview that would require a lot of thought before a smart answer could be given concisely.  Interviewees would leave the interview, put their thoughts together, and make a concise video of their answer.  YC could review these answers anytime.  I bet for 1.2x the time they're spending now, YC could get 2x the information.",1209488067

176697,comment,175864,176600,0,0,chmike,,,"Yes. But their existence, and validity as traveling technique, are still to be proved.<p>The plant seed, or bacteria spore, analogy invalidates the claim that inter stellar travel is impossible for living bodies. Inter stellar travel is thus possible, even without energy source available on the way.<p>We also have to call back in question our assumptions on how a contact would happen and how the ET would look like.<p>The abduction data is on this aspect very interesting because no one could have predicted such a contact scenario. Note that I don't pretend it's true, but the thing is that there is a striking piece of evidence on this subject which out rules the theory of false memory. It is the Betty Hill star map that Joachim Koch recognized as to be our solar system. This interpretation makes much more sense than other interpretation for multiple reasons and the killing detail in it is that Betty has drawn in 1962 a ring around Jupiter and the ring was only discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979 !",1209487925

A back-of-the-envelope estimate on Techcrunch only wastes your time once. This endless stream of eternally-updating back-of-the-envelope estimates threatens to waste your time over and over again, as Fake Steve laughingly points out.<p>The problem with these guesses is that they're dynamic, and the up-and-down movements in the guesses are essentially pure noise, which you are now being encouraged to inject directly into your brain. If tracking hourly movements of <i>actual stock prices</i> is a waste of time -- and it is -- than this is an even higher order of stupidity: It's a waste of a waste of time.",1209487903

176672,comment,176456,176648,0,0,nostrademons,,,"As someone who's been turned down 4 times from YC without getting to the interview stage, I'd say <i>do</i> reapply in 5 months.  Don't fixate on it, definitely do stuff in the meantime, but I think you should treat it as just one more thing you can do to maximize the chance of success for your startup.<p>The big advantage of applying isn't so much that you'll get in (I've kinda given up hope of that happening unless a buyout is imminent, a la Fleaflicker, and at that point we wouldn't need them).  It's that it gives you a regular point to check your progress and see how what you've done stacks up against what you said you'd do.  My experience - with 3 consecutive application cycles - is that we're basically doing exactly what we said we'd do in the first application, just 60-80% slower than we anticipated.  That's very useful data when we're planning future milestones.<p>It also gives you a chance to revisit your assumptions and make any necessary course corrections.  For example, we had a founding-team issue that PG brought to our attention with the first application that we corrected between app 1 and app 2.  Several of the competitors we were initially afraid of have not materialized.  The market as a whole does not seem to be developing as quickly as we thought it would, though it does seem to be developing.  That's very useful data when we're trying to budget finances and decide whether it's time to go for outside funding.  We have the excuse to take another close look at our competitors and see what they're doing wrong and what they're doing right.<p>It's easy to go full steam ahead on coding and then miss fundamental changes in the environment that render all your coding useless.  6 months is just about the right period of time to revisit your assumptions and see if it's still worth doing.  You should be doing this anyway as a business, but YC gives you an excuse and a deadline.",1209486020

We are not quite even space-faring yet.<p>Learning from another species' technology is likely to be a largely one-way transaction.  Instead of trading warp drive tips, it's much more likely that the ""Xarcon"" will have warp drive and we will not.  (Or vice-versa.)  In any case, if the other side has things like antimatter fueled starships, they may still have the potential to wipe out the other civilization, or at least preemptively cause huge damage to it.  Why would another intelligent species give up a potential technological advantage without first assuring the safety of their own species?  Of course, there are many ways of assuring such safety.  In the case of practical warp drive, one way of doing this would be to withhold warp technology and use the intervening time to propagate your own species.  Another option might be to absorb the less advanced species into some sort of confederation.  Actually, a really savvy species would do both!",1209485107

When the construction company bid, it would include a laundry list of conditions of their tender, usually saying abstruse things like ""In s.311(a) of the Scope of Works, we have bid assuming that existing conditions on site are foo..."" and the like. On those tenders they won as the conditions turned out to be different to what they'd assumed (bearing in mind that these conditions were now part of their contract), they'd be able to ask for a variation (and more money) for most things - pushing up the price of the contract while allowing a competitive bid price. This is all legal, and frankly, not that uncommon.<p>The interest thing is that this company had actually worked out how much revenue these guys - the contract analysts - brought in, and they found that the revenue per employee for these guys was <i>more than for any other employee in the entire organisation</i>.",1274853108

I think for most people it's far more important to have a CPU that executes a popular <i>OS</i> (ie. <i>Windows</i>) than to have <i>source code</i>. Similarly, most users receive intangible benefits from having access to the <i>wiring diagrams</i>, as they will never modify it.<p>I have long argued that software and hardware are the same from a source code perspective. Have you ever looked at the source code for a CPU? I have (many CPUs: ARM, Intel, and more). It's just code like if/else statements and assignments. Just like C (plus the extreme concurrency).

1379595,comment,1372275,1374179,0,0,jarek,,,"Right. Here's my experience. While I obviously don't speak for everyone -- steveklabnik is an obvious example of someone who would disagree despite his seniority on the site -- I'd like to think I'm not the only one thinking along these lines.<p>I created my Facebook account in late 2005, in my first semester of university. (This was a couple of months after Facebook was first opened up to non-American schools, including ours. My user ID was #1714 in our network.) You might know the history. Only secondary and post-secondary students were allowed to register, and <i>by default</i> your profile was only visible to people in your school. I seem to recall allowing friendships between people in post-secondary and secondary networks was a big deal. There was no newsfeed and there was no API.<p>It was a very walled garden, but for better or for worse, it was walled reasonably tightly. Bugs were definitely there, but they were usually bugs, not deliberate action. At the time, Myspace was king, and Facebook was definitely presented as a less cluttered, more closed, more elitist, safer, cleaner version of that. You felt like what happened on Facebook would stay on Facebook, and people behaved accordingly. It's sort of like email -- you might realize that it's pretty trivial to eavesdrop, but few people who do realize that will write emails as if everyone could read them. It's more like a real conversation if you don't. There <i>was</i> no sense that whatever we put on Facebook would be public, now or in the future. This was a campus conversation: people might eavesdrop occasionally, but the walls don't have ears or eyes.<p>Then Facebook realized they want to make money and started to slowly turn up the heat on the frog cauldron. You've likely followed the story -- opening up to registration for everyone, loosening defaults, Beacon, applications, 'likes', instant personalization. All along, it started feeling a bit less like a dorm common area where you might chat with friends and more like the internet, where you have to watch what you say. Less like a BBS and more like a job application.<p>Should we have realized Facebook would eventually become what it is now? Probably, but we were eighteen and enthusiastic and idealistic and more than a little bit stupid. To be honest, I don't think even Zuckerberg knew in 2005 what he would do with Facebook in 2010, and we implicitly hoped it wouldn't change <i>that</i> much.<p>Now, I understand why Facebook is doing this. I mostly stay on top of the developments. I started gradually removing the personal of information from my profile a while back. (When signing up, I gave a fake birthday, left gender blank, etc. Still, there is room for feeling betrayed when you realize that no, you simply can't stop people from seeing your profile picture at 200 px wide. That doesn't leave a lot of room for optimism as to what will happen to walls and status updates in a year or two.) At this point, my profile is nothing I wouldn't want or care about the internet at large seeing -- and that's a lot less than it once was. The most recent thing to go were 'likes'; I don't like being described by foreign keys in a database, not to that degree. Call me picky.<p>I'm not even outraged. By now, I've come to expect Facebook to fuck up when implementing new things, to change defaults on me without notice, to open me up to the internet. I conduct myself accordingly. That's probably not the reaction they are hoping for.<p>Still, there is a sense of sadness. I <i>care</i>, because Facebook of yore was <i>better</i> for us. It didn't make money, but that doesn't change the end user experience. I miss having complete control of everything I trust Facebook with. I miss being able to put ""post-beat-power-puff-dance-punk-youthloud-romantic-garage-pop extravaganza"" as my favourite music without some dumb script trying to make sense of it. I miss the four whimsically named groups I belong to that were unceremoniously removed from my profile in a not-so-subtle attempt to get me to 'like' things instead. I miss being able to name my hometown as Trójmiasto, rather than having to name one of the cities belonging to the metropolitan area known by an informal name because Facebook wants a link to a database of all municipalities on earth. I miss what I once had.",1274851376

I just think it's a good idea to be warned when a variable is unused, enough that I'll mark my very few that might be #ifdef'ed out. If you're using a compiler that doesn't let you mark variables as such... well that sucks. You do what you can.",1274850631

You need to justify the criteria by which you are measuring, IMO, in order to explain why such brilliant games are not currently out-competing today's games.<p>By crap, I meant that they had so little resources to work with that most could only work on the level of playability, puzzles and reaction times; to get deeper, they had to rely on text, where they didn't enter into a visceral feedback loop with the player. They worked only on very slim slices of the mind's abstraction stack. If they were reaction-based, they would be at most tactical, not strategic, and certainly not epic in a story-telling sense; and if they got into story-telling, they ended up in interactive fiction land, where they lose the immediacy of high-bandwidth visual and aural representations. They need to say, rather than show, so the user gets a narration, rather than an experience.",1274850587

To be fair, a major release might require a tad more work than usual once every 2 months (think 1-2 extra hours per day that week).<p>I think the key to making it work is keeping it small. If there were too many people, nobody would feel individual responsibility and it would devolve into a nobody comes into work culture.<p>As it is, some people come in to work at 9 and leave at 4:30, some 9-6, some 11-8, some 2-2 (whoops, that's just me :) -- depends on when you like to work.<p>Also, everybody has easy weeks and hard weeks, and there's no point sticking around work if you've got nothing to do.

Of course, you can also contract antibiotic-resistant pathogens through contact with raw meatas, for example, more than 100 people did when the agribusiness giant Cargill sent out tens of millions of pounds of ground turkey tainted with antibiotic-resistant salmonella in 2011.</i>",1379414326

You can have a &#x27;bar&#x27; field in a <i>different</i> module, but then you need to a qualified import (import qualified OtherModule as O) in order to work around the conflict (forcing you to type ugly O.bar every time you need the &#x27;bar&#x27; accessor from OtherModule).

Mastery of basic grammar is achievable with a small amount of dedication; if the author does not have the time, they could ask an English-speaking acquaintance to proof-read their docs.<p>The author&#x27;s primary (and perhaps only) contact with users is through their documentation. Incorrect capitalization and apostrophe use is distracting and will put off some potential users.

I have a nice sunny one bedroom apartment for $1000/month a few blocks away from UC campus, which I&#x27;m only getting for that price because I pretended to move in with my friend, when in actuality he was moving out of the building after living there for around 4 years.  So our names are both on the lease, but only I live there [1].  The prices in the building have gone up over 30% in the past few years - the units now rent for $1350+, which is still pretty cheap for the city.<p>Anyway, my friend was thinking of moving out on paper (i.e., getting his name off of the lease), but now I&#x27;ll have to convince him not to do that.  I doubt I&#x27;d be able to afford an extra $350 a month in rent on my stipend... I think I&#x27;ll have no choice but to stay here for at least my entire grad school program to milk the rent control as long as possible, because rent really seems to be exploding in Berkeley. (Not to the extent that it is in SF, of course.)<p>[1] Throwaway account because I&#x27;m not sure whether this is legal.  It&#x27;s not as if the lease says &quot;All tenants listed must be present in the unit for at least X hours per month&quot;, so in theory it doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be illegal, but it seems a bit...sketchy.",1379412918

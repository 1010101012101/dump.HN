Now, half a century later, the current generation is spending tremendous sums of money to clean up that land. Even after partial rehabilitation, the value of that land is depressed considering its proximity to highly-desirable Manhattan.<p>Entertaining the notion that ""natural rights"" exit,[1] did those companies, through their purchase of that waterfront land which was not very valuable at the time, acquire a natural right to not just use that land for their immediate purposes, but to extract the value of that land for themselves, arbitrarily far into the future? That's exactly what our system of private property allows people to do, and it's almost certainly not economically efficient in the intergenerational sense.<p>The other complex cases are things like land in the west. None of that land would be inhabited without the tremendous efforts of the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1800's to irrigate that land. Nobody who owns land in say Arizona can claim that they have a ""natural right"" to all of the proceeds of that land. Their activity on that land is a vast inter-generational joint-venture. A private company in the government's position at the time could have taken a huge equity stake in any activity in the west, one that would thanks to the law of property inure to this day.

My friend refused to on the principle that he could never let someone like that have custody of a kid.  My friend was killed two days after the judgement giving him and his wife custody.<p>The tattoos are on my forearms and say ""love life"" and ""embrace death"".  It's the inevitability of death and living your life in a manner that at the moment of your death, you can look back and be proud of the decisions you made.  It doesn't mean live today as if it were your last, it means live it such that if it turned into your last, you have no regrets.  And if you have any regrets in your past, fix them.<p>It quickly became second nature to consider all decisions on this axis, and if the result of a decision made you regret it, fix it quickly.",1346352320

So if, like Python, your platform is popular, chances are that those few basic structures have been optimized to death.<p>That does not necessarily make them optimal for every use case, though.

Too low of an index is rather suspicious though, and might also indicate stilistical deficits.<p>* What is the highest index value?<p>Thile the BlaBla Meter was designed for index values between 0 and 1, but in rare cases the scale can be exceeded. The highest measured values so far have been over 2.0 even.<p>* Does Google use a similar algorithm?<p>We don't know, but if we were Google, we'd probably try! Our samples for highly competitive search terms show that highly ranked sites often show good index values.<p>* How does BlaBla Meter work?<p>BlaBla meter checks texts for various linguistic traits, e.g. it checks for exceeding use of Nominalstil[1]. In addition, the text is checked for various phrases [buzzwords] with a certain weighting. We don't want to reveal the secrets though ;)<p>[1] Heavy use of ""nominal style"" is a German particularity. You can replace most verbs by nouns, adding suffixes like '-ion' or '-age', and transform the sentence into passive. This is often found in legal texts, where the author doesn't want to appear as a suject.<p>* Why does my scientific text have such a high index?<p>Nominalstil has crept into scientific language at large. This often serves to 'beat around the bush' - in this regard, there are analogies to typical PR tongue.<p>* My mindless text gets a good score, why?<p>BlaBla Meter can't really understand the topic, it looks after linguistic traits. While rainbow press can be attributed all kinds of substantial weaknesses, their language is usually short and concise.<p>* My text is wrongly devalued!<p>As every computer algorithm, BlaBla Meter might be at fault - in doubt, human beings must decide of course. Generally the hit rate is quite large, so you should usually tweak the wording upon receiving high indices.<p>* But humans read texts completely differently ...<p>When BlaBla Meter crys havoc, one can usually assume that a human reader is alerted too. People are trained every day to tell authentic messages from artifical advertising messages - it'd be naive to belive they couldn't!<p>* What happens with entered texts?<p>Texts are private matter of course, and are neither saved nor processed in any way or shape.",1346351003

That's the nature of independent individuals. That level of diversity means that you can find plenty of people you'll consider nutty, which makes it easy for the media to push the message that those who leave the state herd are mentally defective.<p>But look at the effectiveness of the state schools and ask yourself, if the state system were shrunk down to the size of the various small homeschooling alternatives, would the state program be one you would pick for your own kids, or would one of the alternatives seem much more sensible?

I'm also a founder and erstwhile President of Joyent, which some time ago merged with TextDrive, though I haven't been active with that company for a while.<p>If we have met, I hope it went okay.<p>A couple of weeks ago I received, at the same time as Joyents shared hosting customers, a message announcing an end to support for shared hosting, affecting customers whove been with us for years, some of whom invested in accounts we had intended to support for the rest of the life of the company. The announcement struck many as abrupt. Some took it to be an abandonment of, if not an insult to, your good faith, written in marketing and lawyer speak.<p>I soon spoke with my friend Jason, who by then was deluged with abusive emails and imaginative threats. After I rubbed some salt in his wounds, we began imagining what it would take to continue providing what we'd intended all along to those who put their faith in us. After some wrangling, weve found a way to make it work.<p>Id like to announce that on November 1st, 2012, TextDrive will relaunch anew as a separate hosting company, staffed and funded, run by me. Please consider the recently announced end-of-life for Joyents shared hosting customers now revised to be a continuation-of-life, to be carried out in the same friendly, creative, publishing-centered spirit of TextDrives early days.<p>No matter its humble beginnings, Joyent now operates in a very big arena, producing heavy artillery for the armies of cloud computing, and it's been years since the company has been structured to service the retail hosting customer. Moreover, the servers on which your accounts still reside are old, slow, inefficient, and they go down on occasion. Everyone deserves better.<p>Current shared hosting customers can expect to have at least double the resources provisioned have now, running on vastly more stable and efficient infrastructure. Running, in fact, on the very heavy artillery mentioned above.<p>I intend to have all current paying and lifetime shared hosting customers moved from our old data centers to new, modern and efficient infrastructure by November 1. We'll be doing all we can to automate the migration process and keep discomfort at bay. More communications and instructions on the migration process will follow. For now, know that Joyent shared hosting customers, whether paid or lifetime, are now TextDrive customers and that service will not be interrupted.<p>For updates and resources click here [the page linked by the OP].<p>It gives me great pleasure to indicate that Ill talk to you soon.<p>Dean Allen<p>TextDrive<p>Edit: Here's the previous HN thread discussing this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4391669"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4391669</a>",1346350630

I would rather make the argument that Qt will rise and fall on the platforms it works on.  In the past this was the classic desktop, but with Nokia on the helm they refused to let resources go to making Qt on anything mobile, but their internal projects.  So now with the classic desktop being replaced with both mobile and the web Qt feels out of place.  If Digia does well and gets Qt working on iOS, Android, etc then suddenly it becomes much more interesting for tech news and not so ""old"".  And if someone were to take Qt and build a successful platform on top of it then suddenly it becomes _really_ interesting.   Platforms usually make and break languages and toolkits.  Witness the rise of JavaScript which while being a neat language, no one would say should be the most important language out there like it is.<p>Disclaimer: I currently work on WebKit during my day job and used to work for Trolltech",1346350623

Netflix, for instance, is well entrenched as legal. And Zediva  was basically Netflix with the latency removed. But because of the streaming nature, the one-copy-to-many-eventual-viewers thing was able to be labeled a ""public performance."" When really the difference in a ""spirit-of-the-law"" way is that the lack of latency would require the service to need far fewer DVDs than Netflix, which would result in less payments to the content creators for the same amount of people watching their stuff. Which gets back to the mess that copyright law has evolved into -- in terms of compensation for content, is there any reason that a Netflix service should be worth more to a content creator than a Zediva service? It creates a really perverse incentive in terms of creating more useful services.<p>So going back to why I think this would most likely be struck down: I think the most likely way it would be shut down would be by calling the ""purchase"" system (while a clever hack) not legally meaningful. Especially since the only person this hack enriches is the service provider: now if someone wants to watch more movies, they have to ""buy"" and then ""sell back"" more ""discs"", losing some small amount of money on each of those transactions.",1346350371

After thinking about this for a couple of months the Raspberry Pi came out so I ordered 2 (one for her, one for me!) and set her up with Scratch. While waiting on the RasPis to arrive, I bought her a copy of Loren Ipsum[0] and read it first to make sure it was good for kids and had the right kind of information (it does!).<p>IMHO this might be the best way to introduce kids to programming.  The book teaches fundamental concepts (she was blown away by the infinite string being less than 2 inches) without bogging them down in jargon and syntax (fuck semicolons...).  On top of that, Scratch has really great visual logic and design pieces that fit together like a puzzle and let kids explore the concepts themselves, again without all the nitpicky syntax.  This keeps things fun an interesting while they learn.<p>She is now a Scratch wiz and loves making stuff.  Since she is an avid reader, she likes to create characters from her books and make them do crazy stuff.  During the months I considered how to approach her education, she has amassed an impressive amount of design notes on her first game, including characters and levels.

It is faulty, because it assumes a false premise -- that the C and C++ implementations will be largely of the same complexity.<p>Unfortunately, in the C implementation of anything beyond a trivial application with no large-scale data structures, the majority of the ""reasoning"" being done will revolve around basic data structure implementations!  The very containers, memory allocation structures, and such that require virtually NO reasoning in the C++ implementation, because they are proven.<p>After you've implemented the same basic structures again, and again for the hundredth time in large-scale C programs, C++ is a breath of fresh air.<p>Unfortunately, many people approach C++ <i>before</i> they have many miles on their programming chassis; this is like handing an infant a revolver.  Bad things are likely to happen.<p>This is not a problem with the revolver; it is a parenting issue.  Don't let a junior programmer use a language requiring significant reasoning skills, before they have earned the right -- by developing those skills, repeatedly implementing the very structures they'll be accessing in the C++ implementation!<p>We wouldn't let a first-year civil engineering student develop a bridge design, without first gaining many, many years of experience developing -- and failing -- on much simpler designs.  Why should we expect wide-spread success, allowing junior programmers access to a spectacularly powerful and complex programming tool?",1346350173

God.<p>So, first off, they're so far off of being the ""first company to do this"" that's it not even funny, but this is a common claim in, well, every company to release a product ever. For apps, there was Body Heat (<a href=""http://www.ohmibod.com/app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohmibod.com/app/</a>) and Closer ToGetHer (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGMrGN5ViNo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGMrGN5ViNo</a>) for iphone, Dildroid\nfor android. For bluetooth, there was The Toy, possibly the worst named product in the history of naming things, which established Bluetooth comms with a phone to pick up SMS messages to set patterns on a vibrator.<p>Vibease will be selling their own vibrator, but that's not really a very big deal when you can get a OhMiBod and do audio control (though you lose voice streams since you can't split audio channels to be different between speakers and headphone output).<p>Secondly, their marketing is... so wrong it's scary. They're CRAZY heteronormative, to the point of telling me that gay couples couldn't use it and should find another toy. It's a damn vibrator, people. It works in a surprising amount of locations on all genders you can think of and some you can't and a few you probably don't want to. (Can you tell I live in the Bay Area?)<p>That said, they're one of the first teledildonics companies to really get out there and try to pull VC funding. Jimmy Jane did this with their luxury vibes, though continued success on that is not looking so hot.<p>This is an incredibly difficult industry to stay alive and relevant in, because people's wants and needs change, and if you don't get the interface 100% right the first time, you product is done. Finito. The end. Your app doesn't work right or crashes, you crash someone's brain chemistry in an intimate moment, and you will never, ever recover from the resulting experience memory.",1346350163

If the collection needs to grow from both ends and has lots of random access, then use a deque. Only if neither of those are suitable, should a list be considered and the main reason, IMHO, to use an std::list is if inserting or removing elements in the middle of the list is a common operation. But in the case of removing, if copying is cheap and order does not matter, then a vector may still be better and removal can be done by swapping the element to remove with the last element and then removing the last element. In general, if ordering is not important, a std::vector is <i>probably</i> a good choice.<p>So really, I see the use case for std::list as a real but very rare one.",1346349794

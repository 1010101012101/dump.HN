But, Just because a Mercedes is being compared to a Honda doesn't mean that there's some sort of a class issue at stake.<p>Honda is a fantastic engineering company. In terms of drivetrain technology they are right up there with the very best (for lower capacity engines, I'd say they are better than Mercedes, but I digress). However, Mercedes  (especially till the early nineties) was about attention to detail, not just the drivetrain, but each and every part that went in, was famously ""over-engineered"". If I may, my interpretation of the analogy:<p>a. Honda's focus is on the engineering (drivetrain to be specific), they are willing to do an average (nothing special, but not bad) job for the rest of the package. That includes average interiors, average ride quality, average styling etc.<p>b. Mercedes tries (or did try) to do a stellar job in each of those categories listed above.<p>So, if Android is Google's engineering, Google let's Samsung get away with a plasticky phone (I have used the Galaxy nexus for an hour and a half today). Yes, even now the feel of the phone in one's hand is not even comparable to the iPhone 4.<p>But the analogy falls flat because the Galaxy Nexus is more expensive on contract than the iPhone. Price matters, the pricing helps Mercedes devote resources to develop the products the way they do.<p>Gruber, got this wrong too. His own quote ""You either see it or you dont. If you dont, thats cool, enjoy your Nexus. "" is correct, but it's correct on it's own, not with MGs quote.",1323982083

Which makes your claim of Israeli apartheid is overblown to the point of being ridiculous. Muslims, Christians, Jews, black people, white people, and Arabs can all vote. Everyone can sit in Parliament, as Muslim Arab Israelis have and currently do. Non-Jews can still be citizens, and citizens are not separated into different legal classes like under the South African apartheid system. Back your argument up with something more concrete than your handwavey ""all sorts of ways,"" or don't make it at all.<p>A closer analogue to Israeli discrimination based on religion is America's race- and class-based discrimination. As one example among the hundreds available, prison sentences are many times higher for crack cocaine abuses than pure cocaine abuses -- because the American underpriveleged (who are often minorities) are more likely to use crack, and the American wealthy (who are often white) are more likely to use pure cocaine.

Use paypal, wepay, dwolla (regular) or some other similar provider, use a credit card, use a debit card, use cash, get someone else to buy it for me. None of which costs me anything to do the transaction.<p>Sure, there is some noise about charging for debit cards, but that noise turned into massive backlash, so I don't think that'll happen anytime soon. Plus, there are still other options, like another bank with a debt card that doesn't cost me anything.<p>Sure, a credit card has a fee associated with it and I probably end up paying that fee either in the price of the item I'm buying or directly. But at this point, is the total sum of those fees >$3/month? Maybe, but who really cares anymore? There is a cost to doing business and it can't be entirely free.

I wanted to know whether she really believed toys or suggestive advertising or whatever was really to blame for the lack of women in science.

What could be easier to handle? Read the mc_gross and item_number and update your database. If you want to verify the POST came from PayPal and not someone else that found your secret URL, then you change one variable in the POST data and send it back to PayPal to get a verification response.<p>My PayPal scripts are a couple lines of code. Any competent coder could write and test an IPN script in half an hour... even without reading the docs! Just use the sandbox to send a test POST, look at what you get and write the code to update your DB using the appropriate variables.<p>An IPN handler is a lot less code than integrating any real payment gateway I've used... and PayPal's IPN was easier to handle than Amazon Payments' or Google Checkouts' equivalents.<p>> I'll give you a good reason for not using paypal... paypal freezes accounts all the time, for reasons as simple as 'you made too much money too fast'.<p>So do <i>all payment processors ever in all the history of credit card payments as consumer instruments</i>. This is not a PayPal issue. The only reason you hear this about PayPal is because these businesses didn't try anyone else.<p>Standard merchant account application asks you your estimated gross monthly volume and average ticket size. If your actual volume deviates from this significantly (""you made to much money too fast"") they will freeze your account until they can re-evaluate the processing risk.<p>> I'm not risking my whole business just to use paypal.<p>Those stories you see on the front page of HN would've played out the same if they did the same things with a different processor. It's not using PayPal that risked their whole business, it's not informing their processor before launching a product that would change their volume and ticket size, not informing their processor before collecting thousands of charity donations without being a charity, not informing their processor before selling tens of thousands of preorders for an indie game that doesn't exist, etc. The risk would be there when you do any of these things no matter who you use to process the payments.",1323980104

I remember playing with a lot of LEGO kits when I was a kid, and I always did this.  It's true that, like coloring books, building from kits discourages creativity.  But that's easy to fix with something called parenting.  Let the instructions be an inspiration, not a prescription.<p>(And, it's not a bad skill to be able to follow instructions.  I hear people on forums like HN complaining about how difficult it is to build IKEA furniture.  If they played with LEGO when they were a kid, they'd probably be able to build their bookshelf too :)",1323979877

There's a strong, implicit class implication there.<p>If you took price out of the equation and just looked at the two products, the comparison may be apt, but Josh is staring the price matter in the face and calling foul. I can't say I blame him. I drive a luxury brand car, but I cringe a little bit when people ask me what I drive because I'm concious of the fact that people associate brand, value, and quality.<p>A better analogy might have been artwork. Some people will look at the Mona Lisa and see a painting of a plain woman. Others look at it and see one of the greatest paintings ever created. But like Josh points out, the world is not black & white. Some will see the quality of the Mona Lisa, but will not care. They may like other styles better. They may prefer work from an entirely generation.<p>Josh is opposed creating class warfare out of device functionality. In my view, MG's assessment of iOS as ""more polished"" is true, and I happen to place a high value on that polish, but I understand that I trade other aspects of the device in order to obtain that polish. Others won't make that same choice. Others won't see the polish at all. That doesn't make those people better or worse than me. It only makes them different.",1323979736

Some people think it's better to tie someone onto a hospital bed and medicate them so they don't commit suicide, and then they call suicide a selfish act.<p>The lack of empathy in the responses to your post is actually pretty sick, the best thing you can do for someone who is depressed is to try to understand, to listen to them, and to help them relax.<p>I think people sometimes forget what it feels like to be depressed, and how great the need to not be depressed can be.<p>I also find it hard to believe that some people live their life without at least considering suicide once. It doesn't mean I think it's near the best answer to life, but it's a lot better then some other things people do in life, and I think people have the right to decide what happens with their life.<p>If I may suggest something, you should go read Alan Watts' ""The Wisdom of Insecurity"". He was a very influential man who thought that some ideas in Zen Buddhism could be used as very powerful forms of psychotherapy, and on a more personal note I've found that some of the ideas in that book have helped me feel very peaceful and at home in the worst of my times.<p>It's the only book of his I've read so far, but it was really great (and short) and I plan on reading more. In 'The Wisdom of Insecurity' he talks about how too much people compare their present with their expectations of an impossible future, and with a misrepresented past. He talks a bit about God and religion, but I don't think it was so much a religious book as it was a book about a way of life.<p>For some extra Hacker News cred he liked to discuss about cybernetics, semantics, quantum physics, and sex. Seriously, if you ever contemplate suicide or even just feel inadequate then go to a library on a Saturday, and get the book; you can easily read it in a day and I think it'll make you feel better.",1323979700

10146018,comment,10144420,10145296,0,0,marincounty,,,"The actual quote,<p>&quot;I had stopped at a florist on my way to his apartment and bought myself an extravagant red rose for my buttonhole. Now I removed this and handed it to him. He took it like a botanist or morphologist given a specimen, not like a person given a flower.<p>‘About six inches in length,’ he commented, ‘a convoluted red form with a linear green attachment.’<p>‘Yes,’ I said encouragingly, and what do you think it is, Dr P.?’<p>‘Not easy to say.’ He seemed perplexed. ‘It lacks the simple symmetry of the Platonic solids, although it may have a higher symmetry of its own ... I think this could be an inflorescence or flower.’<p>‘Could be?’ I queried.<p>‘Could be,’ he confirmed.<p>‘Smell it,’ I suggested, and he again looked somewhat puzzled, as if I had asked him to smell a higher symmetry. But he complied courteously, and took it to his nose. Now, suddenly, he came to life.&quot;<p>In all honesty, after reading about the doctor; I know why he didn&#x27;t want to let the world know about his sexuality; he didn&#x27;t want his personal life interfering with his professional life.<p>I always thought I was pretty liberal, and open minded person, but once I learned of his sexuality; I read his work in a different light.  I am ashamed of it, and I hope I can grow from the preconcieved assumptions? Assumptions that were on a subconcious level?  I found myself questioning why he wrote mini-essays on literally every patient?  I found myself thinking, &quot;Did he write the elaborate patient summaries for the patient&#x27;s sake, or was their some other compulsion at play? No-not necessarily sexual, just questing the man--wrongly!  Wow--I thought I was better than this?<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m sorry he died, and I&#x27;m honestly not sure how he will be ranked in history among his peers.  Will it be the brilliant doctor, or just another well meaning, average--Practicioner, who used his profession, and patients to get out of back breaking work?  I understand his passion for writing, but there&#x27;s  a part of me that wonders--if he really cared about his patients, or did he used them as a muse to further his writing?  I am sicken to admit this, but because I know about his personal life; my wild assumptions are wrongly running wild! Yes, they are, and I am ashamed of it.  I a middle aged man who needs to learn so much more!<p>Anyone who has followed my posts, know I am no fan of most MD&#x27;s, except my own of course.  Actually, one I have is in on it for the right reasons!  The other&#x27;s I have known;  well I just hope they didn&#x27;t stop learning after med. school, and realize doing the right thing is better than harming a patient for money? I hope? Oh, I hope?<p>I will get pummeled for this post, but this is my Goodbye.  Yes--it&#x27;s an easy away to dodge the questions, but I&#x27;m done.<p>When I researched the parent post(still not sure of the Internet lingo), I found it immediately indexed on Google--word for word!  It was wrong--it is &quot;buttonhole&quot;, but this guy&#x27;s rude post is there forever.  This guy made a terrible joke, but should it live forever?<p>I finally realized/conceptualized how Noting Is Forgotten on HN.  There Is No Annonymity On The Internet.  How far off Is the day a post is tied to an IP address, and that address is published for all to see?  We all know just how easy it is to obtain a IP.<p>Goodby All.  I really enjoyed my time here!  Those suffering from mental illness, even slight--it gets better with age.  I have no reason to lie.  And while the doctor&#x27;s death is tragic, he lived a long, good life.  His patients are the ones we should be grieving for?  I hope the next generation of doctors make these patients lives easier?  In reality, so little progress has been made to Dr. Oliver&#x27;s patients? So little?  It&#x27;s beyond sad?",1441011451

10146013,comment,10136014,10145853,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> I can understand the concept of ceasing to exist. I have not had anyone be able to explain to me why that makes that person so afraid, other than the fact that it just does.<p>Hard to explain (surprising to even <i>have</i> to explain), but it seems worth a shot.  Consider a degenerative mental disease like Alzheimer&#x27;s; does the idea of suffering from that, or someone in your family suffering from that, bother you?  Why?  If the disease robbed you/them of all sense of self, including any part of you/them that would be bothered by it, does that mean there&#x27;s no harm done because you/they are no longer aware of it?  Assuming you find that concept as horrific as I do, then a more permanent loss of any &quot;sense of self&quot; should be quite analogous.<p>Both are horrifying atrocities.  Both need to stop.  And I don&#x27;t understand how the latter can seem any <i>less</i> horrific than the former.  Yet far more attention is paid to the former, while a hundred and fifty thousand people die every day.<p>>  You&#x27;re talking about interacting with other people in happiness for eternity. I specifically said &quot;forever on this earth&quot;, not &quot;forever, period&quot;. I don&#x27;t think you can achieve what you&#x27;re talking about on this earth. We&#x27;ve had centuries of modern civilization to figure out how to stop both large-scale wars and petty relationship spats, and it&#x27;s debatable whether we&#x27;ll reach a level that has no pain. Yes, we&#x27;ve gotten better, especially if you read some of the literature on the topic, but age-old problems remain and I find no reason to think that they&#x27;ll one day disappear.<p>Fixing mortality is one of many things that needs to happen.  Given all the time in the world, I&#x27;m quite confident we can fix the various lesser problems (and next to mortality, everything is a lesser problem).  Fixing scarcity would go a long way.  AI (or something very much like it) seems like the surest path, though it requires a great deal of care to get right.<p>And I don&#x27;t see why we should be limited to &quot;this earth&quot;, or &quot;this universe&quot; if it turns out there are others.  Forever is a very long time.<p>I have hope.  And more importantly, I&#x27;m working towards those goals.<p>> I actually deal with my worries about this issue in a comment below. I think people go about this subject very selfishly without thinking of the greater consequences.<p>If you&#x27;re referring to your comment about economic disparity making longevity a privilege: probably, but not for long.  It&#x27;s too important not to make universally available.  And to be explicitly clear: I don&#x27;t think <i>anyone</i> should die; I&#x27;m not just worried about myself or those I care about (though I&#x27;d be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t care about them <i>more</i>).  But I think it&#x27;s entirely possible to build a world in which <i>nobody</i> dies.<p>That itself may lead to problems, but they&#x27;ll be problems worth having and worth solving, and we&#x27;ll have plenty of time to solve them.",1441011271

In my experience, VLC handles files which are still being appended data just fine, but it&#x27;ll freak out if it reaches EOF before the end of the stream. If your /tmp is tmpfs, which it is everywhere AFAIK, the only difference is that the video is being downloaded in full speed.

When you&#x27;re learning programming, you write a very small block of code, (e.g. getting inputs, printing a welcome screen) and then build it from there. With math assignments you have to solve the problem entirely and then check the results.\nWouldn&#x27;t it be better if we could graph every step of our solution, write small loops to test out different values and observe their effect?\nThe math questions I encountered at school were based on tedious and often mysterious manipulations of numbers. \nEven though I memorized every formula I would still fail. With computer programming you don&#x27;t have to trust anything. If say you want to learn about pointers, you write some code, get a segmentation fault. You learn from your mistake <i>instantly</i>. \nIf you still don&#x27;t get it, you read code examples, modify them and see the results <i>instantly</i>.\nThat&#x27;s what I mean when I say math seriously needs a REPL.\nIn english classes teachers take pupils to the computer lab and give them online exercises. The pupil can fill in the blanks press a button and check his/her answers <i>instantly</i>. Why don&#x27;t we do this with math? \nComputers give the pupil the chance to try out different things. If you get stuck, you can always ask it to your teacher.",1441009975

They were thinking big... too big.<p>For example things like document indexer which is used in 99.99% of cases to search for &quot;some.attribute == &#x27;hardcoded value&#x27;&quot;. Most of the other cases are prefix searches. This can be done in a normal database. Document storage where what chef really needs is ~5 extracted fields and a json blob that only client deals with. (Again - database is better) Message queue to the indexer which only exists to get broken and be a limiting factor. (extracting even 100 fields from json is not a huge work - just insert them as database rows and prevent the indexing delay) They go after new technologies, where a very conservative stack would be more than enough.<p>The server API is public, so I started working on a replacement using only python/flask/postgres. I got maybe 80% implemented (ignoring the enterprise namespaces). Then got discouraged because I discovered some API flaws which I thought were just too big - for example the API call to update and create a new node is exactly the same, which can make terrible mess by accident. (seen in real deployment) In the end I just started using salt which I think is a better solution overall.<p>If you use chef and would like to continue, I&#x27;m happy to send you the repo. (email in my profile) If you don&#x27;t - I can only recommend migrating to something better (salt, ansible, etc. - your choice).",1441008819

And getting administrators to install new software on such a cluster can be difficult in itself. Adoption of new programming languages and libraries is slow in this space mostly for that reason I think, and if you want to have a successful framework, you need to provide it with basically no dependencies attached apart from what you typically find on these systems. Don&#x27;t forget, the users typically aren&#x27;t computer/software engineers, they are scientists in my case.

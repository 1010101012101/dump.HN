7838829,comment,7838469,7838469,2,0,adrianhoward,,,"Interesting… I&#x27;ve never really thought that the <i>point</i> of speaking is to get a message out to the maximum number of people — which seems to be the definition of effectiveness the OP is using (and on that scale I wonder why books are at the bottom too…)<p>Some of the reasons I speak at conferences:<p>* Before I started speaking at conferences I got a lot out of attending. Both in learning and networking. As corny as it sounds I like to give a little back to the communities that helped me when I was younger and less experienced.<p>* Not everybody learns the same way. I know that I&#x27;ve attended workshops and talks that have made clear topics that I&#x27;ve found opaque after reading books, blog posts, etc. People have told me that they&#x27;ve got more from one of my workshops than they have from hours of reading and unstructured practice. So while I might not be reaching the maximum number of potential listeners, I may well be reaching people that I would have otherwise missed.<p>* I reach people through different channels. The people attending a conference are not necessarily the same people who read blog posts, mailing lists, etc. If you&#x27;re following a blog on X, then you&#x27;re interested in X. Conference talks are an opportunity to reach people who maybe didn&#x27;t even know X existed.<p>* I find presenting in front of groups a little daunting and difficult. Practice has made it less daunting and easier. Communicating to groups of people is a useful life skill — from business meetings through to pitching to investors. Presenting makes me practice and improve it.<p>* I value the time I invest into making a good presentation. It forces me to put my thoughts in order and really think about the most effective way of communicating a topic.<p>* Unlike the OP I have got work through speaking. Both directly, from people who&#x27;ve seen my speak, and indirectly from folk googling around a subject area and finding my name pop up repeatedly around particular topics at conferences.<p>* I generally don&#x27;t present at a conference unless I get at least travel / accommodation / ticket. So this reduces the cost of an event to opportunity cost at <i>worst</i>. This means I can go to more events. I enjoy and get value from conferences so this is a good thing in-of-itself for me.<p>* Speakers usually hang out together at some point. This means I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to meet and occasionally make friends with some wicked smart people. Occasionally folk in the &quot;Squeee! I&#x27;m a fanboy&quot; area ;-)<p>* I generally get more feedback from a presentation than I get from a blog post. Both directly from talk Q&A,  folk approaching me with specific questions, etc. And indirectly from watching the reactions of the audience during the session.<p>* You often have the opportunity to present something multiple times at different events. This allows you to experiment with different ways of putting the message across with fresh audiences. Something much harder to do with blog posts, etc.",1401785945

Research indicates that it&#x27;s simply untrue.<p>&quot;A larger body of economic research investigates the effects of state and federal minimum wage increases. These studies compare employment trends for states or counties that have different minimum wages. The best studies make comparisons to nearby states or counties to control for regional economic trends. <i>These studies also find no statistically significant negative effects on employment or hours at an aggregate level or for low-wage industries such as restaurants and retail stores, or for specific groups of workers such as teens.</i> These studies also do not find substitution effects (such as shifts in hiring away from black and Latino teens).&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;In a prospective study of the San Francisco minimum wage, Reich and Laitinen (2003) carried out a representative survey of establishments. They estimated that a 25.9 percent increase in the minimum wage from $6.75 to $8.50 would result in a 1.1 percent increase in the overall wage bill. When viewed from the perspective of operating costs, a 26 percent increase would result in 82.0 percent of establishments experiencing an increase in operating costs of less than 1 percent or more, and <i>95.2 percent experiencing an increase in operating costs of less than 5 percent.</i> Breaking down results by industry, they estimated that 17.9 percent of restaurants \nwould experience an increase in operating costs of 5 percent or more, as would 8.6 percent of retail establishments. For manufacturing, entertainment, hotel, and personal service firms, the estimated increase in operating costs was close to zero.<p>Pollin (2004) similarly estimated that the average increase in firms’ costs relative to sales under Santa Fe’s 2003 minimum wage ordinance would be 1 percent; the average cost increase for hotels relative to sales would be 3 percent.<p>Benner and Jayaraman (2012) analyzed the impact of a proposed increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 (a 39 percent increase, not accounting for inflation during the phase-in) on the food industry.

The initial Google search clusters were pretty small, a half dozen or so systems, though the Web was also a small fraction of its size.<p>The aspects of this I see being possible game-changers across the hosted SAAS space are of 1) autoconfiguring cheap systems, 2) better residential broadband, and 3) distributed tools which work very effectively even with tremendous decentralization.<p>On a per-user basis, the amount of compute resources allocated by even very large sites is relatively small.  You can provision as much on your own.  What providers <i>do</i> offer are engineering, robustness, reliability, and data redundancy.<p>Engineering can be provided through self-configuring systems -- a Debian base, set of packages, autoconfiguration, and a minimal set of things the user needs to worry about, and you&#x27;re up and running.  With SSD / flash drives, you buy yourself around much of the seek latency of spinning rust.<p>Robustness and reliability through a grid-provisioned service would ensure that the system as a whole is up even if individual nodes are offline.  You&#x27;d also need some smarts against attacks, but if the system could communicate among nodes indicating what traffic is considered harmful it should be reasonably self-healing.<p>Data redundancy can be provided through sharding and replication schemes.  Figuring out how to account for balance of data of a given node (if you want to load a lot you&#x27;ve got to offer a lot, and/or obtain credits somehow, perhaps through payment).<p>The one additional benefit DCs provide is for very rapid communications between nodes -- < 0.001s, sometimes better, latencies, rather than 0.01s - 0.1s between Internet sites (sometimes worse).  This matters for multi-tier applications where web proxies, application engines, and databases need to talk to one another.<p>And if you <i>do</i> need some DC infrastructure, costs for that are falling (and capabilities increasing) such that much of it can be provided on a light budget (traffic costs are likely your biggest concern).<p>What I see is an erosion of the technological limitations which have made the present commercial model viable and/or necessary.  Which suggests that it may be increasingly supplanted, especially for mature spaces.",1401782667

7838638,comment,7837495,7837495,1,0,throwaway24235,,,"30 here. Just for the purpose of stats and to give some idea of who is writing this since it&#x27;s a throwaway and I&#x27;m not willing to link to my social profiles (you&#x27;ll just have to trust me), I have always gotten quite a bit of female attention, even more now as age has done me well I&#x27;d say. I get quite a few &quot;first messages&quot; (they initiated conversation) from attractive women on certain dating sites.<p>With that out of the way, I&#x27;m also a &quot;traditional virgin&quot; at the moment. I say that because there&#x27;s more than one sex act, and therefore more than one kind of virginity. The why for me has nothing to do with looks or personality, it&#x27;s more a combination of not wanting to be too close with certain girls/women I was seeing when I was younger, life circumstances, etc.<p>I also don&#x27;t see sex as a casual thing, it&#x27;s very much a relationship intimacy thing for me, emotionally. I also don&#x27;t see virginity as something to &quot;get rid of&quot; as fast as possible, so I simply haven&#x27;t worried about it all that much.<p>I don&#x27;t fit the &quot;unattractive, awkward virgin&quot; category even a little bit, so perhaps I can offer some experience on what the women I&#x27;ve dated actually think about being a virgin at this age when the other factors are removed.<p>The women I&#x27;ve been seeing and dating recently have varied opinions about it, as you&#x27;d expect.<p>One woman had a very negative opinion of anyone who was still a virgin beyond their mid 20s (even her female friends). We knew each other very well so I can say that she was looking for experience, did not want to have to &quot;train&quot; someone, etc.  I had to stop seeing her for other reasons (read: run) before this particular &quot;I&#x27;m a virgin&quot; conversation ever took place though. I imagine it would have gone poorly.<p>Another woman I&#x27;m actively seeing simply does not care about my being a virgin. At all. This isn&#x27;t uncommon.<p>Another thinks it&#x27;s &quot;admirable&quot; (I think partly because I told her the same thing I said in the 3rd paragraph). That reaction isn&#x27;t too uncommon either in my experience.<p>In my experience (n = < 20), some women will care (a lot, and reject you for it), some won&#x27;t. It isn&#x27;t going to be a problem with everyone, and as long as you aren&#x27;t clueless (educate yourself...) and don&#x27;t think sex is exactly like porn, it will just be slightly awkward rather than a total nightmare for both of you.",1401782621

Go feels like a mix between python and C.<p>I haven&#x27;t gotten to Swift in a deep enough way, but it looks like it tried to tackle the same problems with the exception of concurrency. There are differences such as classes and generics in Swift. There are also similarities such as functions as first class citizens (or so it appears so from the closures section of the free book).<p>All in all, it reminds me of Go just a bit. It doesn&#x27;t remind me of all of those other languages that I do not know.",1401782412

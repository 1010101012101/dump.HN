  I want everyone to understand that this blog is about generating ideas. So I don’t consider these perfect.
  They’re just a few suggestions that Apple should keep in mind.

  So, add “+1″ if you’re in favor of a more open iPhone and “-1″ if you’re not. Then we’ll see what you have to say;
  which is what really matters imho.

Maybe it's just me, but I suspect it's not.<p>One case: I own the paper Book of DJango. But I keep noticing I prefer to read it from the screen of my laptop. I also read newspapers, but prefer to read those from paper.<p>The reason for wanting to read code from screen is because I've become so used to syntax highlighting, whether in vim/gedit/TextMate/eTextEditor or on websites. I've come to expect it from he internet, where I do most of my learning. Going back to textbooks, black code on a white background seems like a massive blur of text.<p>Thing is, I'd happily pay for The Book or DJango, or any other text, in full color with syntax highlighting.<p>Am I the only one?",1229415834

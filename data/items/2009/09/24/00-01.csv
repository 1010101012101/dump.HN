840418,comment,839833,840393,0,0,netsp,,,"Some bits from that site which contain the closest thing to an answer to my questions.<p>""<i>What I have against the Church of Scientology (CoS) is its deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its arrogance, its attack on free speech, its litigiousness, its harassment of its critics, its lack of concern for families, its gross neglect and abuse of children, etc.</i>""<p>""<i>The Church of Scientology is a vicious and dangerous cult that masquerades as a religion. Its purpose is to make money. It practices a variety of mind-control techniques on people lured into its midst to gain control over their money and their lives. Its aim is to take from them every penny that they have and can ever borrow and to also enslave them to further its wicked ends.</i>""<p><i>""On the surface the Church of Scientology seems reasonable. The insane content of it is only revealed to a person when the early stuff has done its work and made them more susceptible. After a short while a person ""believes"" that Scientology is doing them good. They are then persuaded to help their new-found group further by donating money and/or working for the organisation for almost no money. Many people do exactly that.""Ethics"" is used to good effect to trap a person. A personï¿½s natural tendency to do good is worked upon. Yes - they want to be more ethical, but what is ethical? This is where a clever trick is pulled! ""Ethics"" is redefined by Scientology in such a way that to be ethical is to be a better Scientologist and obey the ""church"".""</i><p>I don't have concise quotes for the other point so I'll try to explain them. The centre of the beef seems to be about how the church protects itself using litigation, influential contacts to control the information about it available to the public. It is very difficult to ""prove"" that Scientologists believe in any of that southpark stuff because their documents are copyright protected.<p><i>""By using copyright laws the Church of Scientology withholds information about the teachings of its founder from the public. The public sees only a limited amount of information, information the ""Church"" feels will not harm its reputation to any great degree. Thus people are attracted into it based on this limited information and its seemingly fascinating possibilities. Once in, the existing members of that organisation have the opportunity to possibly erode the critical thinking faculties of the new member over a period of years. After that, the person has either left, been evicted or possibly their critical thinking faculties have been eroded to the degree where the absurd is accepted as spiritual truth.""</i>",1253753729

If you want to have a more comprehensive listing look to <a href=""http://shii.org/2ch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shii.org/2ch</a><p>> <i>Peaked in size I understand that 4-chan servers tend to be very heavily trafficked, to the point that many people have said ""DOS attack on 4chan? Is the internet on?"" or something of similar meaning. Is this what you mean, or does it have to do with some kind of critical mass relation between Anonymous contributors and how much Original Content can be created/consumed (I would assume there is a peak point for that, although I don't have the slightest idea where that would be).</i><p>4chan can be and <i>is</i> DDoS'd. The traffic to the site is MASSIVE (they've had to upgrade hosting several times and at least a couple of years ago or so they were constantly maxing out a 100Mbps connection), but they are occasionally taken down. Note that there is a significant amount of spam to the boards with links to malware or other sites trying to promote themselves (or just spam trying to 'flame' the 'community').<p>A number of DDoS attacks were initiated by way of uploading an 'image' that was just a javascript file with the extension changed. The text of the post then instructs the user to save it to '4chan.js' and double-click on it. Unfortunately there are a lot morons that do this and (at least the site admins claim) that this infects their computer somehow (I suppose the browser; most likely IE and Windows users) making them a 'zombie' in a 4chan-directed attack. The admins then need to try and post information on how users can remove this stuff from their computer. This is sort of ingenious if you think about it... The best way to DDOS 4chan is to infect all of its users with something that increases their normal traffic to the site 10 fold or more.<p>> <i>Back in the glory days I see this often, although it seems to be more a state of message boards in general than 4chan, although it does seem particularly loudly voiced on 4chan. Would you mind elaborating what those glory days were like, sense it certainly seems to me that some of the most impressive things to come out of 4chan have happened recently (Chanology, the Times poll rigging, and the like).</i><p>This is just people being nostalgic to the past. There are people that claim that site was 'never good' and people that claim all of the 'newfags' are 'the cancer that is killing 4chan.' (At one point 7chan.org was hijacked to redirect cancer.org) 'Anonymous' is such a hodgepodge of differing opinion that you really can't get a single unifying view-point on anything. There are people that go on 'raids' to hijack people's emails and whatnot... and there are other 'Anons' that are referred to as 'white knights' that try and warn people that have been targeted. Sometimes 'glory days' posts are nothing more than trolls trolling other trolls too. You really can't take too much on the site seriously.",1253750962

I trained for a year, and recently ran my first marathon and I'm now addicted. I can completely relate to what you say above - its so easy to just go on and on (because you seem to be able to) completely ignoring your body. I've had 14 hour days at work at the end of which I'm <i>very</i> tired, and yet would easily run 8 to 10 miles and feel extremely refreshed at the end of it, that I would go back to work.<p>Adrenaline kicks in as a result of high-intensity workouts, and it then becomes hard to tell your body to slow down and rest.

It's not as if there's a single-payer proposal working its way through Congress, although I think there ought to be. Health insurance sucks; even people who have it are often reluctant to visit the doctor in case it impacts its future coverage although this may result in a loss of economic productivity. A single-payer system will not deliver the desired results to everyone all of the time, but at least it won't treat people as if past illness were somehow a breach of contract.<p>Certainly, singe-payer means everyone paying a bit more tax to subsidize the least healthy, and if taxes are high enough the risk-/reward ratio of individual private enterprise becomes uneconomic. But if the required tax increases are modest, the benefits for job mobility and general financial security (vs medically-related bankruptcy) will more than outweigh the cost.<p>Right now an individual's medical problem  all too often becomes a financial and legal problem as well. It seems to me that decisions with legal and financial aspects which must be taken in order to obtain medical treatment are made under duress. I had to have emergency medical attention last year and I really wonder about the enforceability of contracts I signed while puking and under the influence of morphine. And I had a good experience overall (no complications, not huge unexpected bills, quick recovery). Given how Kafkaesque the situation is for a good outcome, I shudder to think what it must be like for someone with a deadly or chronic condition.",1253750667

The Israeli Jericho rocket was actually a joint Israeli-South African project (the Jericho missiles were tested in SA btw). The RSA rockets would have been able to carry South African nuclear warheads.

Reason being: press is like raising money --  you have to get a lot of excitement to get the best coverage. Putting the news out on your blog fails on multiple points:<p>- No deadlines, so there's no urgency for the press to pick up your story (vs one that's more urgent). No urgency in practice means your story will not be written about.<p>- Cat's out of the bag. It's much less exciting to re-print news than to break it, and news that's exciting gets first priority.<p>- This makes it old news. Similar to the last point -- why cover it if it's already been covered?",1253750589

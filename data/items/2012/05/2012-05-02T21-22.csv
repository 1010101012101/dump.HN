It removes less than two bits of entropy even from a randomly generated password, but it means that users reset their passwords less often, and I would guess that when users reset a ""forgotten"" password, they usually choose something weaker (and thus more memorable).",1335995969

3921426,comment,3914611,3917542,2,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Oh it's quiet a big deal when you're not set up for it from the beginning, and it costs you time and money to transfer your client to another developer.<p>When you handled everything for your client from domain registration to hosting to ftp and email accounts and some of the scripts require relative URLs (relative to your hosting account's directory on your hosting company's server) and their mysql databases are with you. Surprise! You've got a few hours to a few days of work ahead of you. Sure you can charge the client. But again, if you're sick of that shit you can't just ditch them. If the other developer wants to do it, they can't because there's no way you'd give them admin access to your server. And since you're on a shared hosting server you don't have the privileges to create a temporary admin account that only allows access to the things that need to be transferred. You're stuck doing all this work.<p>If you want to get rid of the client you now have to oversee that all these things are successfully transferred. And no one can do this but YOU. The more complex the client's site the more of a pain in the ass things become. Things add up quickly.<p>Oh, Just a few things you need to do. :)<p>- make backups of absolutely everything<p>- Transfer the domain (up to 7 days)<p>- Setup and reteach the client their ftp details<p>- transfer email accounts and if they have an IMAP account, have fun backing up all their emails and attachments and transferring them to the new IMAP acount. Same applies to an archiving POP3 email account.<p>- Go into all 3rd party scripts and reinstall everything<p>- change all relative paths on all of those 3rd party scripts as well as changing the mysql details (some scripts aren't simple ""drag and drop then reinstall"" scripts) they are instead a pain in the ass to migrate because certain options aren't stored in the mysql database that you just backed up. Instead they're in the filesystem and you have to back that up and drag and drop everything over, and if you re-install it you lose all those settings so you have to spend a whole day planning out what exactly needs to be dragged and dropped over.<p>- transfer all backups little by little to their new destination<p>- transfer over all the mysql databases<p>- RE-train your client to understand ALL of these new changes and answer any support emails when they have problems or something is wrong. (NO they won't send emails to the new developer, they'll send them to you)<p>- Answer emails from the new developer who doesn't understand exactly how everything was done.<p>And a lot of this requires everything at the other host to be somewhat setup, which requires a bit of cooperation between you and the new developer. And when it takes most people 5 days to respond to an email because they're overloaded with work (something I'm guilty of right now). A complete transfer after ironing out all the kinks could take over a month.<p>If you were smart and planned ahead you would have just created a whole self contained account with a host and had everything wrapped up together so when you transfer your client to a new developer you just hand the new developer the admin username and password to the control panel and leave. But you didn't. You're Chris Norstrom and you're new to this crap and so you did things the wrong and long way. ;)",1335995958

I really doubt that actual Stanford students enrolled in a machine learning course would be lost on the incredibly basic operations (e.g., taking the partial derivative of a polynomial function) he is using.<p>Also, there has been no acknowledgement of how contrived the exercises are.  For instance: exercise one gives a data set of a the profitability of a company's existing stores versus the population size of the city in which the store is located (in units of 10,000 dollars and people, respectively).  The range of the data is 5-23 (population), with most of it concentrated below 10.  We fit a straight line to the data using least squares, then use that line to predict the profitability of two new locations--in cities of populations 35 and 75.  I understand that this is an intro course, but there is not a word about how ridiculous this is.<p>I don't mean to be overly negative.  I am enjoying the course, but I am surprised a bit by how basic it is.  Let me say that I do like the approach of the course to ML, which is to formulate a parameterized cost function and then minimize it by some general method, rather than the typical statistics course approach which is to solve ordinary least squares directly, which gives an ""exact solution"" (given the data) but does not generalize to more general models.<p>I know this is foundational material and overall, I am impressed by the approach of the course, but I would expect more comments on the weakness of the nave methods we are employing at this early stage and how they will eventually be improved.  I find it very helpful when professors at least reference more advanced methods or provide references for further reading by the interested student.  Admittedly, that is more frequently a feature of graduate courses, but encouraging students to go beyond the material is an important aspect of good teaching.  I have watched the videos for several other online courses and I do appreciate the fact that Coursera is allowing me to hand in assignments for grading, which vastly increases by engagement with the material.  This, in fact, is the most valuable resource offered by the program.  The lectures themselves are fine--if a bit dry--but a good book or a set of well-prepared notes (not slides) would probably suffice just as well if accompanied by the assignment grader.<p>All in all, this is great.

3921250,comment,3915479,3916188,2,0,bradleyland,,,"I think you might have missed my point. The P2P portion isn't the amazing part for me, it's that Skype call quality is so good without any of the traditional network engineering requirements I'm used to.<p>I work out of Florida, but most of my partners are in Ohio. Our phones in the Ohio office are delivered by a SIP carrier. The SIP carrier provides a router that establishes separate VLANs (on the local network) for the phones and computers. The phone traffic is prioritized so it goes out over the WAN link first. Granted, once it hits the internet all bets are off, but at least the voice packets are hitting the wire first. That should make our telephones the best performing VoIP option in the Ohio office.<p>That's not reality though. Everyone in the Ohio office prefers Skype because the call quality is better and the connection is more consistent/resilient.<p>I can read a SIP trace, and I understand a little bit about CODEC design. I can somewhat reliably identify the difference between a G.711 call and a G.729 call just by listening. In other words, I'm not a complete layman, but I'm not a voice engineer. What amazes me about Skype is that their voice stack performs so well without any special considerations at the network layer.<p>In an ideal world, a voice engineer wants not only a separate VLAN for voice traffic on the LAN, but prioritization all the way to the PSTN termination point. This usually means you need to get your transport link from the same carrier who provides your voice service. For example, if you buy SIP service from Level 3, Level 3 can also sell you a transport link, on which they can prioritize your voice traffic all the way back to the place where they connect to the PSTN. This assures the best possible transport quality.<p>Skype has <i>none of this</i>, but still manages to deliver great call quality. That is amazing to me, and it's a game changer. It decouples your voice and data provider.<p>The key reason to move away from P2P isn't technical, but business related. Enterprise decision makers demand more control over their network. By controlling the super-nodes, Microsoft opens the door for a whole different kind of customer:<p><i>Integrate Skype in to Exchange</i><p>With Skype integrated in to Exchange, desktop devices (Skype phones) could be segregated on to their own VLAN. The Exchange/Skype service (running on a server) can be bound to a network interface on this separate VLAN. This satisfies common enterprise network design requirements where voice is prioritized on the LAN. This would also provide an internal endpoint for Skype clients to connect to and pass through a set of business rules and/or integrate with internal applications. This is a typical use case for Exchange. Exchange would also handle call routing. Think of Exchange as the PBX, keeping intra-office calls on the LAN, and routing outside calls over a configured link.<p><i>Moving Skype Super-Nodes to Dedicated Infrastructure</i><p>The best reason to integrate Skype with Exchange is to replace the traditional SIP carrier. When a user picks up a Skype phone on their desk and dials by directory, the call hits Exchange. Exchange can examine the call and make some interesting decisions:<p>Directory lookup matches a local Skype username: call is routed entirely over the LAN.<p>Directory lookup matches a Skype user, but user is not local: call is routed over the outbound interface and through the traditional Skype infrastructure (now run by MS instead of P2P).<p>Directory lookup only contains a traditional telephone number: call is routed over the outbound interface and through the traditional Skype infrastructure (now run by MS instead of P2P), which terminates to the PSTN.<p>With Microsoft running the super-node, they have better control over the performance of the Skype back end.<p>The benefit of the ability to bypass the PSTN can't be understated. Many carriers offer what is called ""free on-net calling"". If your call is placed to another user on the same carrier, it is free, regardless of their geographical location. Skype could do the same. If you're calling another Skype user, the call is free. If you need to punch out to the PSTN, you get normal Skype rates.<p>The chances of an enterprise buyer considering this type of service over P2P is remote at best. There might not be any technical reason P2P couldn't satisfy the requirement, but it's bad joo-joo from a purchaser's perspective. They want assurances, and MS owned/run super-nodes make a lot of sense.",1335993562

Are you being intentionally ridiculous.  They license songs.  I don't know the terms of these specific licenses but the way they work in general is that they can license the game for a specific use and/or term.  I'm not a lawyer so I don't know specific legal terms off the top of my head  but there's a different license for the PlayStation version of the game where they are giving the user a copy of the song to have and to hold and one where they would stream, which I assume the iOS version is actually doing. Again, not a lawyer so I don't know the specifics but you will often see something like a TV show having broadcast rights to use a song in their show but they (especially for older shows) may have failed to procure the appropriate rights to use the song on the DVD version.<p>Now, I don't know too much about the Rock Band app so I'm sure someone more knowledgeable about it is likely to come through and correct me but it sounds like the songs are streamed for the iPhone.

By whatever system of Likes you care to design...  I say ""yes.""<p>That makes the ""Anonymous Like"" system a clear target for Search Engine Optimization.<p>People have to pay for ads.  If it turns out that the Conversion numbers for a set of search words are lousy, then advertisers will give up on those words, and the price on those words will plummet.  It's to Google's advantage to find GOOD ads, that users actually WANT to see.  It's good for advertisers to only have their ads up if users WANT to see them.  And it's good for users to only see ads that they WANT to see.  The economy on ad words helps solve those problems.<p>For YouTube videos, Google knows how many people watch all the way through a video - which is one metric.  They know how many times people start watching the video.  They could know how many ""Anonymous Likes"" there are.  And they can know how many +1s and Shares there are.  The number of replays, too.  How often people click on the video, when it shows up in search results.<p>Given all of that data, I assert that it's possible that Anonymous Likes have no technical value.  The task: given all of the metrics, predict the likelihood that User B will enjoy watching a video.  I think it's possible that Google / YouTube have determined that the number of Anonymous Likes has no statistical correlation to the likelihood that User B will enjoy watching the video.  I think it's possible that the number of Anonymous Likes should have no bearing on the Rank of a video in Search Results.<p>Your assertion is that ""The decision to eliminate 'Anonymous Likes' is not a result of technical needs"".  That's possible, but I think you're only speculating.  Otherwise, [Citation Needed].<p>> it's a decision ""from the above"" to force a ""more social"" Google.<p>If I'm correct, that Anonymous Likes have no statistical correlation to whether User B will enjoy the video, then don't you think it's possible that having Google+ users, who are signed in, be able to +1 and Share a video might actually create BETTER RESULTS for users?

Variations on the Repugnant Conclusion occur immediately to anyone told about utilitarianism, and are discussed in first-year philosophy right there when utilitarianism is introduced.<p>LessWrong <i>routinely</i> has discussion articles showing some ridiculous or horrible consequence of utilitarianism. The usual failure mode is to go &quot;look, this circumstance leads to a weird conclusion and that&#x27;s <i>very important!</i>&quot; and not &quot;gosh, perhaps naive utilitarianism taken to an extreme misses something important.&quot;",1405965590

8064967,comment,8064786,8064786,71,0,napoleond,,,"This is my favourite article about Bitcoin to date, and properly describes one of the main ideas I wish Bitcoin detractors would come around to. Bitcoin has a lot of problems as a unit of account and as a store of value, but <i>that is not primarily what Satoshi was building</i> (<a href=""https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>). Bitcoin is, and has always been, a medium of exchange first and foremost. It still has <i>some</i> shortcomings in that regard, but it is the closest thing we have to solving the trust issues of peer-to-peer exchange in a purely technical fashion.<p>Comparing Bitcoin addresses to the IP layer of the internet is brilliant. Something that the Bitcoin community has been a bit slow to accept is the idea that &quot;peer-to-peer exchange&quot; may be occurring at the <i>corporate</i> level rather than at the individual level for most people--it&#x27;s hard to imagine a world where that isn&#x27;t true due to the points outlined in the &quot;Comparison to the card networks&quot; part of this article. <i>However</i> as long as the corporate implementation is done in such a way that anyone <i>could</i> jump in as an individual if they wanted to bear their own risk, then we are still miles ahead of how the traditional financial system currently works (&quot;net neutrality&quot; for money).",1405965549

Packets flowing through this wire fall into three categories:<p><pre><code>   * Traffic for which both A and B are being paid by their respective customers\n   * Traffic for which A is being paid by the sender or recipient, but B is not paid\n   * Traffic for which B is being paid by the sender or recipient, but A is not paid\n</code></pre>\nThe latter two categories are called &quot;transit&quot;; that&#x27;s when you carry packets between two parties, neither of which is directly your customer.

I would say no.&quot; is the argument. This is all a matter of personal opinions of course, but it&#x27;s not more complicated than the TLS/CA system.<p>The operating procedures is modelled against regular DNS, on purpose, and should fit well into your existing workflow.

This discussion has been had a million times on IETF mailing lists and I don&#x27;t know why it keeps popping up. Perhaps djb has some sort of fan base out there who wants him to &quot;win&quot; some imaginary discussion.<p>No, DNSCurve is designed to secure your DNS questions and answers from prying eyes. DNSSEC is designed to authenticate and proof the extisting DNS system from tampering both by resolving and authoritative servers.<p>One of the early design goals of DNSSEC was to be backwards compatible with the existing DNS system, protocols and implementations.<p>Any divergence from these principles will be very difficult to get implemented. Any reason why DNSCurve or any other standard in the DNS space is without implementations should be sought here, not in a conspiracy.<p>> DNSCurve actually does something useful, and DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s simply not true. DNSSEC is implemented around the world and solves a problem. If it is a useful problem or not depends on your point of view.<p>But there is no reason to come up with all these straw man arguments against a technical standard. Please join the relevant mailing lists and speak your mind in more technical terms instead. There is no cabal in your way, but you must be prepared to argue design goals, operating procedures, implementation, and Internet governance.<p>> &quot;The CA system is worse&quot; isn&#x27;t a rebuttal to &quot;DNSSEC/DANE gives the USG direct control of certificates&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not what I said.<p>No, DANE does not in <i>any</i> way give the US Government <i>direct</i> control over certificates. It does, however, make them dependent on the DNS root, which is administered by an organization indirectly appointed by the US Government.<p>However, that is not a problem given that the US Government has not much actual say over daily operations -- and even if they <i>did</i>, that would not be a practical attack vector due to the reasons laid out above.<p>&quot;The CA system is worse&quot; is a rebuttal to not doing anything. If you want the CA model gone, you need to get your TLSA records out there and you need to get them signed, now.<p>The reason for that is that there is no alternative. DNSCurve does not solve this problem. TACK does not solve this problem. No other system has support in <i>any</i> popular DNS software, and designing any contender takes ten years to get implementation, support and operations right.<p>Please keep attacking this problem, and please keep testing new ways to solve this. Not by rehashing old arguments against DNSSEC that has already been rebutted, but by embracing it and see what can be done better.",1405965370

8064931,comment,8060377,8060779,1,0,Joe_iP,,,"saroshk, great points.  However, I feel you don&#x27;t understand our solution completely.  First off, their is an inherent need for print-to-web solutions.  This has been an obvious demand with technologies such as augmented reality, quick response codes and near field communication.  This demand has been created mostly by marketers.  The advancements in the algorithms that effect both Search Engine Optimization and Email is making marketing online a difficult thing.<p>This has created a push back over to direct marketing and self-promotion.<p>Our swivelCard platform isn&#x27;t a solution for a USB drive.  If that was the case, I&#x27;d agree completely with your comment.  Our swivelCard platform is closing the gap on print-to-web compatibility issues.  Globally only 1 in 5 people own a smart phone.  Things like QR, NFC, AR, Evernote only provide a solution for a very small part of the problem.  USB &quot;PORTS&quot; on the other hand are in abundance. This fact makes swivelCard the most universal solution for anyone looking to reach a large audience/demographic with a print-to-web solution.<p>I also wanted to touch on your point regarding &quot;getting an email address&quot;. I agree, I doubt anyone would plug in a swivelCard to get someones email.  To be honest, swivelCard makes an email address a moot point.  I can take one swivelCard and assign it to you and give you direct access to my laptop via a screen share.  Or I can take one swivelCard, attach it to a dropbox shared folder and share information with you that way.  Yes, we could do that via an email, but I&#x27;m sure you and I both can agree in the world of sales (business) some people don&#x27;t share their personal information (email).<p>You also mentioned &quot;cloud based services&quot;.  The idea behind cloud based platforms is to keep people connected to an experience.  Almost all cloud based platforms can be shared through a simple URL.  swivelCard lets you exploit this feature by simply copying and pasting that URL into any point of communication on the card.  Meaning, I can take 200 swivelCards and attach them to 200 separate dropbox folders.<p>You are correct in regard to some of our existing customers like photographers and videographers. And they do use it to share their portfolios, but the more interesting use-case you haven&#x27;t imagined. A photographer can actually use swivelCard as a cross-sell.  Instead of including a CD with digital versions of client photos they can sell their personal business cards as a part of the photo packages.<p>When you stop thinking of swivelCard as a thumb drive and start thinking about what it really is, you&#x27;ll understand it has limitless potential for sharing digital/cloud based solutions that are accessible by everyone.",1405965238

Let those companies court you, not the other way around, and get everything you&#x27;re hired to do written into your contract.\nIf you&#x27;re changing jobs that often just because you&#x27;re supposed to in order to be considered successful then that&#x27;s probably the biggest problem.<p>Freelancing is an option I guess, aswell as starting your own company without the intention to sell. That still makes for alot of work on the business side of things though.<p>Lastly, you seem like a guy who doesn&#x27;t have too much trouble finding a job so risking your job by saying no seems like a small risk to take considering what you could gain.

8064918,comment,8063358,8064838,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"There are benefits and drawbacks to multi-writer teams. I say this as someone who spent the first half of his career in TV development and production. (In fact, I briefly interned on a Trek series back in college.)<p>One of the benefits is, for lack of a better word, scalability. A single writer would take <i>forever</i> to write 100+ cogent, consistently great, full-length episodes of a TV show. Since TV series&#x27; fates are always in flux, you can&#x27;t afford a primetime series with only one writer, who becomes a crushing bottleneck if any changes in volume need to be made. Writing a great TV episode is hard, hard work and takes time. Now imagine writing 12, or even 22 of them on an insane production deadline!<p>On the other hand, some shows and formats work really well with a single writer/auteur. True Detective is famous for having been entirely written and entirely directed by just one writer and one director. Now, True Detective was a miniseries of only 8 episodes, and at that scale, a single writer is more realistic. I doubt you could have produced a primetime Star Trek series with only one writer and one director.<p>An interesting hybrid approach is what I&#x27;d call a staff structure with a clear &quot;visionary&quot; at the helm. This is sort of like what we saw on Battlestar Galactica: a show with a full writing staff, but one or two writers who basically dominated the process and authored the bulk of the series. MASH is another good example; Larry Gelbart clearly exercised strong, authorial control over the show, even though he didn&#x27;t write every episode.<p>This latter approach tends to work the best, in my experience as a fan and as a former TV person. But it can have its difficulties and drawbacks, all the same. Sometimes there are limits to the imagination of even the most creative individuals. If you&#x27;re relying too much on a strong auteur type, and he or she gets writer&#x27;s block, or gets sick, or becomes extremely difficult, you&#x27;re SOL.",1405965135

But bridging the gender divide solves two problems that bridging the race gap won&#x27;t solve.<p>The first is product sensibilities. While it&#x27;s not better or worse, most women do think about things differently from most men. If a large portion of your customers will be women, it&#x27;s really difficult to develop software that&#x27;s intuitive and serves their needs if you don&#x27;t have some female perspective when building that product.<p>The second problem it solves is keeping the best and brightest male developers in the industry. It sucks working in an industry where 90% of your coworkers are other men. When I was in school, there were a number of my classmates that switched away from a CS major simply because they wanted more girls in their classes. To a lesser extent, the same happens after people get into the industry and see just how few women they&#x27;ll get to work with.<p>It may be cynical, but I think attracting white women to the industry is just as much about better targeting a rich demographic and keeping the white men we already have happy rather than it is about being inclusive.",1405965082

It was because you presumably didn&#x27;t do anything else that gave you the opportunity of connecting with people.

And would probably have had more free time.<p>But that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re wrong. I went to meetups regularly, participated in events like Rails Rumble, worked at co-location spaces, etc. I got plenty of human interaction but it simply wasn&#x27;t the same as what I get now at my full time job. I liken it to home schooled kids. Sure, they can setup play dates and events with other home schooled kids or participate in out-of-school programs with public school kids, but they will never truly get the same level of social interaction public/private school kids get because they aren&#x27;t going through exactly the same trials in exactly the same way.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I loved the freedom I had when I was a freelancer and I will likely go back to that lifestyle some day but I would be lying if I didn&#x27;t admit that there was a certain sense of disconnectedness I felt after all those years being on my own.

By the time of the movies he&#x27;d made a lot of progress and grown a lot as a character, but in a couple of the movies (particularly Insurrection) it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s regressed almost all the way back to the first episode of TNG.

8064799,comment,8061469,8064474,1,0,nmrm,,,"> Why would you do that?<p>Because I have a finite amount of time in the world. Because we need to decide which policy to enact (or not) today and not in 20 years. Because producing and evaluating arguments takes time, and -- most importantly -- because bad actors exist.<p>> The idea that I would throw out someone&#x27;s argument because I&#x27;ve decided that it must be wrong in advance seems ludicrous.<p>Witness e.g. Microsoft trolling standards committees into non-existence back in the day. I&#x27;m sure they had an endless supply of valid and brilliantly illustrated technical points to consider, but at some point you have to say &quot;you&#x27;re a bad actor, and I&#x27;m going to start disregarding your arguments because you&#x27;re making the decision process intractable and, like it or not, something needs to be done eventually&quot;.<p>--<p>Regarding infomercials:<p>> The reason I don&#x27;t waste my time vetting the arguments in infomercials is because I&#x27;m not currently interested in a juicer, not because of a belief that people who make infomercials are liars, no matter how consistent their arguments or verifiable their premises.<p>Right. You have an a priori opinion that you don&#x27;t need a juicer (or whatever), and you stick with that instead of wasting time considering the commercial&#x27;s many valid arguments about how buying a juicer will totally enhance your life.<p>edit: it&#x27;s not that the infomercial guys are liars per se. It&#x27;s just that you&#x27;ve decided that evaluating their arguments for why their product will make you happier probably isn&#x27;t worth your time. And in most cases, I claim that most people make that decision <i>precisely because</i> the source is a paid advertisement. That&#x27;s an ad hom dismissal of the argument that juicers save marriages (or whatever, can you tell I don&#x27;t watch infomercials? :-) ).<p>> Those reasons came after listening to their arguments, not before.<p>It&#x27;s the particular person, not any of his theories per se. If one of these theories was mentioned by another person (even someone I didn&#x27;t know), I would probably investigate if I found the time. But this particular person proved his signal-to-noise ratio is too high long ago, so I stopped listening. That&#x27;s ad hom, but it&#x27;s also a cost-effective. I don&#x27;t want to spend my finite time on this planet objectively analyzing the evidence for every conspiracy theory my friend happens to latch on to. And I think that&#x27;s rational, even though it&#x27;s ad hom. And the reason is that evaluating the veracity of arguments is time consuming, and I have finite time.",1405963788

Riker completely puzzled me; I kept hearing about how cool he was supposed to be, and to me, he just seemed like kind of a dick. Worf was pretty cool. Geordi was ok, and he got a lot of good will for having been on Reading Rainbow. Troi was annoying, but 12-year-old me really appreciated her taste in spandex. Beverly Crusher was kind of boring. Picard was pretty cool.<p>As an adult, I still find Wesley annoying (if, ironically enough, less so). Data is still pretty awesome. Riker has grown on me in a way that I don&#x27;t think I would have been capable of appreciating as an inexperienced kid. He is a nuanced character that you kind of have to have lived a little in order to get. My opinion on Worf is largely unchanged, though his stock benefitted retrospectively from his appearances on DS9. Geordi got better with the benefit of time. Troi still bugs me; I find her one-dimensional with only occasional chances to shine. (Probably not her fault. It seems that the writers just didn&#x27;t know what to do with her, other than consign her to stereotypical, damsel-in-distress and love-interest tropes. Her mother, by contrast, is a fantastic character, if a bit of a lightning rod amongst fans.) Beverly Crusher grew on me a bit -- especially in contrast to Dr. Pulaski, whose odd, technophobic Data-bashing felt really out of place in the 24th Century. Picard went from being &quot;pretty cool&quot; to being, unquestionably, the best thing about the show.",1405962509

But <i>even in mathematics itself</i>, codifying proof in a formal system is quite rare and practiced only by logicians, certain subfields of CS, and a few early adopters. edit: And, far more to the point, most arguments aren&#x27;t and can&#x27;t be mathematical in nature.<p>> Attacking that argument means pointing out flaws in the reasoning or the premises.<p>> I don&#x27;t understand how the rest of your comment relates to argumentation.<p>The problem is that you&#x27;re assuming arguments cost nothing -- in terms of money or effort -- to produce. But this simply is not the case. Even in the very best-case scenario of mathematics itself, proof search for even relatively trivial theories is incredibly costly (triple exponential). So even for tiny little factoids that are perfectly well-defined, constructing a valid argument can be intractable.<p>Now consider the more likely situation where the actual truth of the proposition is effectively unknowable (most of economics and politics) or very difficult to know a priori (a lot of modern science). The resources committed to producing argumentation is probably the most important indicator of the quality of arguments.<p>> It sounds more like a comment on marketing - and while marketing may use different arguments of varying quality, it is not in itself an argument.<p>Right, well, I claimed that a lot of marketing is argument construction.

So one day when you&#x27;re <i>not</i> being asked out, ask to have a talk with the founders.<p>&quot;Hey guys, had this talk with my significant other last night and they told me that while it was okay to put in some extra hours, I couldn&#x27;t be burning both ends of the candle by doing both tech and business work. It makes me impossible to get along with, cranky and miserable.&quot;<p>This sets your limits, puts the onus on some outside party, and presents the founders with a constraint at a time when the constrain is meaningless -- after all, they don&#x27;t need you now. Then when an actual event comes up, gently remind them that you&#x27;ve already had this conversation. Offer to talk sometime during the day. Hell, have the biz folks come by the next standup. That way they can talk to the whole team.<p>The point is, you&#x27;re not trying to hurt the founders, you&#x27;re just placing some reasonable constraints on what&#x27;s possible and what&#x27;s not possible. It&#x27;s not your idea (and in reality, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s just the way you are), and it&#x27;s not the end of the world.<p>At the end of the day, you have to set limits. There are tricks to setting limits that reduce conflict. You should use them. But as long as you&#x27;re needed for something you&#x27;d prefer not to do, you&#x27;ll never completely eliminate that stress.",1405962041

Similarly, Google&#x27;s revenue declined over a 6-month period from $16.9B in 2013Q4 to $15.4B in 2014Q1, so by your logic Google&#x27;s revenue is shrinking too(!)<p>In reality sales are highly cyclical: you need to look at least at the year level to measure a trend. This is why I keep pointing you to payment processors BitPay and Coinbase, as they have existed for at least 1.5 years (and they publish numbers despite being private companies). Now that the first public companies are starting to accept Bitcoin (Expedia, Dell, Dish Network, Overstock), it is going to give us more data on Bitcoin&#x27;s growth as they release public financial reports.",1405962031

C99 fixed this behavior with types for specific sizes so people could finally write portable code. Julia should adopt 64bit integers by default given its intended audience and the reality that even some phones have 64bit processors. int64_t works on 32bit processors too, but with a performance penalty. Having the range of a variable depend on the machine architecture really went out of style a long time ago.",1405962027

I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s an unalloyed good although it&#x27;s a fairly natural outcome of a variety of factors including on-demand viewing and serial TV being something that can &#x27;t really be replicated in movies (for the most part). On the other hand, there are certainly examples of historical TV SF that haven&#x27;t been serialized and, in the case of The Twilight Zone, were purely anthologies.",1405962011

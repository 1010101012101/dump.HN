Every time when you learn something new the brain creates new neurons and new neural pathways. Little children have amazing ability to learn with ease and create something out of nothing. This way they develop millions of neural pathways, especially in age from three to five years. When we get into adulthood, we already have millions of neural pathways developed, but the thing is that we stop our mental effort to learn new things, we rather go do to repeatable things. We need that stimulation. Read more in the article how can you stimulate your brain power!",1338418751

Yeah, they sell some web services, but that's a lot different from going head to head with companies that know about manufacturing like Toyota and BMW or those that know about consumer electronics like Samsung and Sony.<p>I guess they could create an advertising sponsored self driving car or vision glasses that pop up ads (ala Walter Williams recent novel ""The Fourth Wall"" ISBN-13: 978-0316133395). But how is either going to be more profitable than their current model given the fundamental retooling of their business which would be required and the radically different cost structures associated with making real stuff?<p>That's not to say Facebook is destined for significant innovation.

You can store variables in APC and they are available in local RAM across all PHP processes (within CGI + webserver at least, the same APC cache is not available to cronjobs and other scripts).<p>>> ""2. I wont need experts"" - It must be nice, if boring, to be working on really simple codebases where anyone that can hack PHP can work on your application.<p>This can be read as a negative, but I see it as a positive in a lot of cases, i.e. when you already have a plan for your app, and you can get by with a reasonably good developer who can follow directions and write good code. I think what the OP meant was that you're not constrained to rock-star/ninja keywords, but if you find that person, then all the better.<p>>> This goes along with ""11. It plain works"" -- yea, depends on how you define works. ""A lot of that is based on assumptions (or shortcuts) that PHP takes to solve a problem. Most often those shortcuts work, and the workarounds are very easy to implement (Im thinking mainly about strict type checking here).""\n>> And that's the real issue that I can see with PHP. Sometimes, some stuff might sorta make sense, and the rest of the time you're in this weird ""gotcha"" land, with the inconsistent API and language design.<p>Correct, PHP is not a strictly typed language and the userland function and class names are not very consistent. There's a lot of other languages that are more elegant and fun to work with.<p>It does have very real benefits in terms of flexibility, ease of deployment, expected behavior under heavy load, and finding developers who can learn quickly whatever is unique about your stack.<p>Every language and stack has it's own ""gotcha"" land; this issue is not unique to PHP.

That has many contradictions.<p>E.g. Google App Engine's GQL, Facebook's FQL and Yahoo YQL not to mention Hive all have a very SQL like syntax.  \nSo what about all this is NoSQL ? SELECT, WHERE and FROM are OK in a NoSQL database?<p>Dig further and you'll find that these are all ""No-Join"" data bases and it's the badly scaling cost of the Join operation that gave SQL a bad name and the NoSQL community a bad category name.<p>Bottom line there needs to be a unifying formalism to talk about NoSQL as a category.  Which (""Tada Boom!"") gives me a seque and a pun to refer to a paper published in the IEEE about using Category Theory to describe NoSQL.<p>I will critique it elsewhere, but suffice it to say that if I have to do a PhD in Pure Math to design a database it's a non-starter. (Aside I have a ""PhD"" in Pure Math - everything but thesis)<p>So anyhoo bottom line - \nMissing: a formal framework to reason about databases that don't use SQL or Joins.<p>Without that it is not even possible to decide what is the membership criterion for something to be called NoSQL, especially when NoSQL is defined as \n""Not Only SQL"" \n= SQL UNION ~SQL \n= the whole F<i></i>ing universe.<p>So NoSQL is a label that has no ability to make logical distinctions.

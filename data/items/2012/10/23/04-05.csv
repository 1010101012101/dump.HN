You should start with Babylonian law...<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi</a><p>Fortunately for humanity, such principles have been the foundation of civilisation since the time of Babylon. What you think is stupid is actually a part of the foundation of civil society.<p>I think the loss of principles such as these are a big part of the rot in our society. Take for instance Wall Street. Once there is a disconnection between the actions and behavior of people in positions of influence and authority and the consequences of that behavior, you get an economic moral hazard and the implicit license to do and say whatever pays your pockets for that day, ignoring all the downside risk.<p>The correct answer the scientists should have given at the time is ""yes, there may be an earthquake. Or there might not be. We can't tell."" Not just saying what the politicians wanted to hear. Not just putting out a statement to placate people and make them feel safe. That is certainly negligent. This is not an attack on science. This is holding authority to account for their negligence.<p>Personally I think the case should extend into the negligence of politicians who forced the scientists to release the statement as well. Also negligent may be the builders or building code authorities who allowed such fragile buildings to be built in a high quake area. There is more than one negligent party here.<p>Also not covered in the article is the fact they arrested the non-scientist who made the prediction and locked him up, because he was driving around trying to convince people to relocate before the earthquake hit.",1350968280

I guarantee you're losing at least half the players.<p>Some other notes from a quick playthrough:<p>* Shadowing is impressive!<p>* You should probably scale 2x by default. Full screen is too big and default is too small<p>* I love the premise of the story<p>* You should have a visual reaction when you're hit<p>* Sticking in the same direction as you're firing works but I would limit it to key down, not key hit - let the player turn as normal when they tap fire<p>* It would be awesome if stalactites fell when you shot them, able to take out enemies<p>* Unfortunately I closed the game accidentally having gotten this far in the list and couldn't bring myself to button mash through the intro again :)<p>One last thing; I understand that it's the end of a long project and you just want to get it out. But the hours you spend to get the launch right (marketing, testing, feedback from friends etc) are <i>critically</i> important to the success of the product as a whole.<p>They're easily worth 10x as much to the bottom line as the hours you spend hacking away in the middle of the project. Single changes can have a 20% or 50% or 100% impact on sales.<p>I wouldn't try to release quickly and barely test a project I've been working on for two weeks, let alone two years - something to keep in mind so you don't have to learn it the hard way like I (and many others here) did.<p>In any case, great first project! Do you have a mailing list to sign up to? I'd be interested in hearing about whatever you come up with next.",1350966437

Don't believe their status updates that make it sound like it was a tiny little area of their data center. It was pretty much the entire zone and then whenever there is an outage affecting an entire zone it brings down global services and even other zones as well.<p>We had servers in the bad zone and started having load issues. When I went to use the cool cloud features that are made for this, the entire thing completely fell on its face. I couldn't launch new EC2 servers either because the API was so bogged down, or the new zone I was launching in was restricted because of load.<p>Basically, the thing that nobody keeps in mind when they think it's so cool that you can spin up servers to work around outages is that EVERYONE IS DOING THAT. This is Amazon's entire selling point and when it comes to doing it, it doesn't work!<p>We were lucky to get some new servers launched before the API pretty much completely went down. They started giving everyone errors saying request limit exceeded. The forums were full of people asking about it.<p>ELB, Elastic IP, and other services not associated with a single availability zone completely failed. I keep seeing comments saying that if people designed their stuff right, they wouldn't have an issue. That's just completely bull, AWS has serious design flaws and they show up at every outage. It's NOT just people relying on a single zone.",1350966417

This has turned out to be a problem in CA.<p>Pharmacies don't want to touch MJ because it's illegal under federal law.  The regulatory arm of the state of California doesn't want to touch it for the same reason.  Some cities attempt to regulate it, some don't.<p>Because the dispensaries produce a lot of cash profit (in violation of prop 215, but whatever), they have been able to fund lawyers to sue cities and invalidate all regulations.  It turns out it's really hard to craft a regulation, even a simple one for licensing, that holds up to court challenge.  The city of LA has given up and explicitly called in the Feds to raid the MJ shops.  (The feds get them for tax evasion -- kind of a catch 22 because it's hard to report this income on your federal return; as mentioned, they're not supposed to profit but there's no way to check.)<p>I voted for Prop 215, but I really had no idea how quickly it was going to turn to shit.

5471352,comment,5468525,5469198,4,0,hysan,,,"""If you go to Harvard/Stanford/MIT/etc -- basically any of the Ivy League, top LACs, or a few other elite schools -- and your family makes under, say, $60k/year, your tuition/room/board/books will be absolutely free.""<p>Unless your family is paying for multiple children going to college at the same time. Mine was a lower middle class family paying for my older brother and I to go to college (with my younger brother going to college by time I was a senior). My parents combined made more than 60k but not by all that much. Combine this with the fact that Columbia's financial aid pool actually dried up when I entered the school (an alum eventually donated a hefty sum a couple years later but that was after I graduated) and my family ended up not meeting the harsh financial aid requirements. And my case wasn't unique either. My roommate, and eventual best friend, was in the same position but without a younger sibling.<p>""Even if your family is a bit wealthier, it's still the case that for most middle-class families the cost of an Ivy League education works out to less than the cost of the local state school.""<p>This one isn't true in all states. In NY, if you had the type of grades that would get you into an Ivy, you would get some form of scholarship to most of the local state schools. My cousin (same year and school) wasn't good enough to get into an Ivy but he had good grades. He put his effort into showing a few choice state schools that he was really interested in them. This landed him a partial scholarship (with grade requirements that he easily hit). Combined with how easy commuting is in NY (so no dorm) and his total tuition came out to less than half of what I paid in a single year.",1364788779

But that's ""monopolies"", not one ""monopoly"".<p>There is perhaps a ""copyright industry"", consisting of companies and institutions that have a financial interest in the maximal copyright and maximal copyright enforcement.

A military sniper is probably ok with taking a shot where if he misses, another enemy beside the one he's trying to kill gets killed instead, most of the time, as long as his odds of hitting the target are high enough.  So those shots can be in the 600-1500m range.  I've never heard of police shots beyond 300m.  They're usually 50-150m but often with glass or other barrier material between them and the target.",1364788645

5471342,comment,5469310,5470086,3,0,KMag,,,"As for your idea of compiling to some bytecode, if one wants to minimize sandboxing overhead, the representation needs to carry along with it an efficiently machine-checkable proof that it is well behaved.  There are other ways to do this, but a sound static type system is the most well researched way of doing this.  On top of this, the semantics of JavaScript aren't very clean, so there's a tension between making the semantics of the representation a good target for JavaScript and making the semantics of the representation a good target for non-JavaScript languages.<p>A stack-based bytecode would likely yield the best code size (at least in the absence of compression).  An SSA-based representation is most attractive from the standpoint translating to the most optimized native code.  A register machine representation is a good happy medium for fast interpreters and pretty good tracing JITs.  People also occasionally float the idea of shipping around compressed syntax trees to at least cut down on bandwidth usage and time taken to tokenize and parse JS, as a least disruptive option.<p>In the end, I think there are too many options and too many players with conflicting goals for a standards committee to come up with a solution that gets widely adopted, so we'll need the invisible hand of the market to sort out the competing ideas.<p>At present, I think the closest we've got to your ideal is LLVM bitcode via Google's PNaCl plugin.  Emscripten can generate JavaScript from LLVM bitcode, closing the loop, but I'm not aware of any production systems that target PNaCl with an Emscripten fallback for browsers that don't understand PNaCl.<p>Edit: s/space usage/bandwidth usage/, note that compressed syntax trees are the least disruptive option.  Those wishing to disrupt the browser language landscape probably don't want the least disruptive option, but it's probably preferable to a lower level representation that too closely matches the semantics of JS, as that would tend to force JS semantics deeper into the VM's implementation.",1364788577

If not, prepare yourself; you are in for a frustrating experience.  What you call quibbling is what you pay several thousand dollars an hour for.  That is the essential function of the legal profession.  To quibble.  However, it is not ""quibbling"" to state that SCOTUS has no power of judicial review granted in the US Constitution.  It is an assumed power; an assumption which could just as easily be undone by another accident of history.  Therefore, they are hardly best described as the ""ultimate"" arbiter.  That power remains one of the consent of the governed.  Clear?<p>The examples you state are of the executive branch exercising (illegally) State power for political purposes.  It is not the marshals of the SCOTUS directing the US Army or some nonsense.<p>As for your ""lack of memory"" regarding the legislative and executive ignoring the dictates of SCOTUS you need look no further back in history than the same civil rights era you point to.  Most of the opinions regarding civil rights emanating from the Warren court were flatly ignored for years.  It was the force of public political will and some may argue an ascendant media that changed public policy.<p>See above?  To what?  I hate to tell you this, but an opinion of SCOTUS is not a magic incantation.  According to your view I suppose if SCOTUS decided some absurd conclusion in clear contradiction of the Constitution it would simply be law?<p>Consider a more realistic scenario.  For example if a future Court decides that the absurd Roberts opinion in the ""Obamacare"" decision and its legal gymnastics regarding the commerce clause is reversible.  Do you think the executive and legislative will refund all the taxes and penalties they will have collected in the interim?  If we follow your line of reasoning, a future SCOTUS makes the law void as of the date it was enacted, magically as if it never existed.   This may be what they teach in high school civics classes (do they still teach those?) but it is not how power ebbs.<p>The judiciary has no real power other than that of apparent authority.  Why do you think they have resisted for so long cameras in the courtroom?  Why do they engage in absurd theater of black robes (thankfully no wigs)?  Because once people see how the sausage is made that apparent authority evaporates and they are just another arbitrary institution.<p>SCOTUS and most, but definitely not all, supreme courts throughout history thankfully have been nothing more than theater.",1364787849

Brokers are people who trade securities on the behalf of others, and the 15(a) applies various requirements to them, ranging from minimum capital requirements to general requirements not to use fraudulent or misleading statements in the sale of securities.<p>Given the central role brokers have occupied as critical intermediaries in securities transactions, it's not really hard to see what precipitated their regulation. Who knows, maybe modern technology will make such intermediaries obsolete and consequently make 15(a) obsolete. We're not there yet, and in the meantime I don't see anything particularly morally outrageous about having to ask the SEC for permission to not adhere to the various broker-dealer requirements in situations where you are arguably functioning as an intermediary.<p>As an aside, regulations are very often oblique, arbitrary, and manipulated by special interests.

5471289,comment,5469347,5470271,1,0,asafira,,,"I think I agree with most of your points, but disagree with your disapproval of ""easier to learn"". The presentation of material really makes a gigantic difference on how well you learn the material (if at all). While I agree that coursera and edX shouldn't hasten towards ""gamification"" of any sort, I think there is plenty of work in making the classes of better quality, and I think that _will_ make it easier to learn.<p>I was taking a course on coursera where I thought the professor was talking too quickly --- so I actually slowed it down to 75% the pace in the video. Awesome! I was happy to be able to do that.<p>Otherwise though, I don't think the course was presented that well. For one, lectures were shitty recordings of slides; I was looking at nothing but text and static images for entire lectures (never seeing the professor's face), and they were blurry, hard to read, and just hard to understand. Of _course_ that makes it harder to learn! I have to focus on figuring out what the hell is written there! And there was no (free) textbook for the course.<p>Anyway, I think the point I am just trying to make is that while the author of this article might be suggesting to Coursera to take steps in questionable directions, I DO think a lot of those courses could be better polished, and that would make it easier to learn from them.",1364787591

5471218,comment,5470548,5471009,1,0,gizmo686,,,"The problem is when someone is trying to browse the code. When things are well named, then it is much easier for someone unfamiliar with the code base to find their way around. I've done a fair amount of hacking around in open source projects. There are some projects where I can download the source code, know what I want to do going into it, and just do it. In other projects, when I am at a place I think is relevant to what I want to do, I have to dive deep into the programs abstraction layers just to see how certain objects and functions behave and what they do. Some of that is likely an unavoidable result of me needing to get to a rather core part of the code, but it seems like a lot of it has to do with the clarity of naming.<p>If I need to know the precise behavior, I will generally look it up anyway, but I do not need to know the precise behavior of everything.",1364785608

However, I will draw a parallel with Salsa dancing.<p>For anyone who has ever watched ""Dancing With The Stars"", actually dancing on a floor in a club, leading a woman is an incomparable experience. Especially if the woman likes your lead.<p>There in lies the rub.<p>If you're not a good dancer, the woman will not have a good experience. Talk about real-time feedback.<p>When you first start Salsa dancing, you suck. The only way to get better is to either a) go to a lot of lessons (ranging from the free lesson at a club to group lessons to $$ private lessons) b) practice at home c) go dancing.<p>And there will always be people who are better dancers than you because a) naturally talented  b) dancing since they learned to walk c) extremely hard and dedicated d) athletes (good muscle memory). But the point here is - even if you're not the best dancer, just earning the right to be on the dance floor (always make the woman look good, always protect the woman (other woman can step on feet with their high heels), dance to the music) makes you part of a community.<p>Dancing is basically skills + confidence. And confidence goes a long long long way.<p>To anyone who wants to code, go for it! Don't let yourself stop you.<p>Start taking lessons (CodeAcademy, books), practice at home (e.g. build your own stuff), get on the floor (a.k.a. build stuff with other people, dive into hackathons). Eventually you will get the skills and confidence you need.<p>You might not be compensated at market rates for it (at first) but if you keep and going, you will eventually be paid for the value you produce.",1364785409

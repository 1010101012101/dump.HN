It is INCREDIBLY satisfying to bind books, especially personal journals. I&#x27;m a huge bibliophile and for a while books were just like magic grimoires to me but once I learned a few of the techniques, you can make some really innovative designs and then the real magic begins.<p>Writing. Working on a novel right now (written out in longhand), but before that I&#x27;ve written a few collections of poetry and even had some work published here and there. I think my most successful piece is an OKCupid bot that creates poems from people&#x27;s profile text and then sends them the generated poetry. People really liked that - even got to speak about it at Brown University and it was heavily used in an academic paper someone wrote about conceptual poetry and technology (okay so technically that last one is a computer activity haha).<p>Have been debating getting back into astronomy, but I live in a very light-polluted area so probably wouldn&#x27;t be worth getting a telescope. Occasionally I will take the rail upstate with a good pair of binoculars and a starmap (and maybe some weed).<p>The other activities I engage in have pretty much been covered in the thread. +1 to hiking, cooking, and biking.",1450385989

10754485,comment,10748931,10753079,0,0,alexqgb,,,"Content dev. here, with no connection to any particular platform. Haven&#x27;t demo&#x27;d PSVR, but based on its wand-style controller I&#x27;m comfortable saying that the Rift + Touch is the best, and for reasons that the other platforms may have a very difficult time competing against.<p>As far as resolution, tracking, field of view, and general comfort go, the Rift CV1 and the Vive are closely matched, incredibly good, and - if you can believe this - underhyped. Though PSVR is said to be not <i>quite</i> as good, the technical bar is so high that Sony can come in slightly under and still deliver an awesomely good experience, and probably a more popular one once you factor in value for money.<p>That said, I still think Oculus has a fundamental advantage due to the approach they&#x27;ve taken with Touch. Unlike the wand-style controllers used by HTC and Sony, Touch allows you to point and grab, which turns out to have a major effect on the sense of Presence, as well as level of dexterity you can bring to your interactions with the environment. It also reflects what your hands are actually doing in social apps, which has value that becomes immediately clear once you&#x27;re in one.<p>Indeed, the combination of social + the manipulation of near-field objects is (at least to my mind) the very core of VR. This wasn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d anticipated, but having experienced it, I cannot imagine developing content that didn&#x27;t put their combination at the center of the experience, since doing so would put you at a serious competitive disadvantage to people who did see them as fundamental, and had worked from there.<p>I should say that I&#x27;ve seen some very clever interaction strategies in the Vive that do a good job in working around this limit, but there&#x27;s no denying that they&#x27;re making virtues of necessity. Ultimately, the Touch gives developers far more to work with, and I think that&#x27;s going to be the decisive feature, especially now that the Rift also supports Vive-style room-scale tracking. Once devs. start  to really understand and master the potential of Touch + social, I suspect the most engaging content ideas will gravitate to the Rift. As hardware fades into the background and content comes to the foreground, I suspect this advantage will pull the entire Oculus platform ahead.<p>Of course, it may be possible for Sony, HTC, and any other entrants to abandon wands and mimic the Touch&#x27;s design in much the same way that traditional game controllers have all converged on the same basic form. If this happens, all bets are off. But until it does, I&#x27;d put my money on Oculus.",1450385745
10754483,comment,10753574,10754373,0,0,klodolph,,,"Yes, you paid a tax.  But my argument here is that the tax for writing in different languages on Win32, Unix, and Mac OS was far cheaper than the tax for writing in other languages on a Lisp machine.  This is because translating low-level code to high-level code is not as straightforward as the reverse operation.  For example, if I compile C to JavaScript, how do I even think about writing a function like memcpy()?  You end up with a monster like asm.js where interacting with the DOM is a chore.<p>Yes, the web brought a renaissance in different languages.  But we already had a bunch of different languages lying around when the web became important.  We were already using different languages to write desktop software.  I didn&#x27;t even learn C until the late 1990s, but I was happily writing software before then.<p>WebAssembly is going to make languages other than JavaScript palatable in the browser, and I can only see that as a good thing.",1450385738

There have been other issues where this has happened (like the infamous trig optimization bug), but I&#x27;m not aware of one for Math.random().<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that a good number of people (like [1]) outside of the V8 team were also skeptical because of lack of specification for the RNG, speed downsides to switching, and the availability of a CSPRNG in the browser and node. You can argue that they&#x27;re wrong, but that&#x27;s not immediately clear, Bug reports sometimes become that site of those arguments, and sometimes even the right arguments end up losing a round and having to come back in when the right people are noticing. Working as intended.<p>Regardless, the blog post or bug report dichotomy is a false one anyways, as obviously you can write a blog post and file a bug (as Mike later said he meant to). It&#x27;s not like he was assailing the V8 team or something. The post was written a little dramatically, but he was engaged with the team in the followup bug (filed by a V8 dev) and elsewhere.<p>[1] <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/sleevi_/status/667636624256344064"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mobile.twitter.com/sleevi_/status/667636624256344064</a>",1450385707

All of the platform documentation & examples were in its &quot;native&quot; language.  You usually had to marshall data structures yourself to fit the data formats of the native language.  You had to write shims (oftentimes in assembly!) that would bridge the calling conventions of your preferred language to those that the frameworks were written in.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that C became the dominant language during the 80s and early 90s: it&#x27;s because Win32, UNIX, and MacOS >=7 were all written in it.  That&#x27;s a large part of what Worse is Better was about.  Richard Gabriel founded a company to write software for Lisp Machines, pivoted it to run Lisp on commodity hardware, found that all of his customers would rather just write in C, pivoted it again to do a C++ dev environment, and eventually went out of business.<p>The renaissance for other languages was really during the web era, when everything just spit out HTML and it didn&#x27;t matter what the server was written in.  Once customers started demanding rich interactivity on the client, there was a strong incentive to write everything in Javascript, and then a strong incentive to write the servers in Javascript too, and then a strong incentive to use Javascript for other things like native apps and IoT devices too.",1450384891

It won best-of-conference at the ACM Supercomputing &#x27;11 conference.<p>Basically the idea is that you have a seed which is used as an encryption key, and then you encrypt a counter value to produce an output.  Using the next counter value represents the second output from the generator, and so forth.  Different seeds produce different output sequences.  If you accept that the encryption algorithm works properly, then the output is uncorrelated for a given counter sequence or seed sequence (although seed sequences are slightly less random than counter sequences).<p>You don&#x27;t need to store state, and you can seek to an arbitrary position in the PRNG stream in O(1) time simply by recomputing the output for the desired counter value.  For non-cryptographic applications, you can derive the seed value from some unique property of your dataset (eg id number of an item being operated upon) and then you don&#x27;t even need to explicitly store the key value.<p>On AES-NI compatible hardware the cryptographically strong varients outperform even crushable PRNGs like Mersenne Twister.  These are a fantastic choice where you have that acceleration.  Your computer is built to do it really fast, and this lets you utilize that.<p>They also offer non-cryptographic but crush-resistant variants that roughly double that performance.  These algorithms parallelize really well and those advantages are even more significant on GPUs, where memory is at a premium and cryptographic acceleration is usually not available.<p><a href=""http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc1...</a><p><a href=""http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/releases/1.06/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/releases/1.06/docs/</a>",1450384784

The &quot;oddities&quot;, how you call them, are the result of not over-abstracting the code to handle yet-unknown problems.<p>That&#x27;s how C ended up as the security nightmare that it is. There are a lot of things you can do in C that you can&#x27;t do in Python - you can reinterpret strings or floats as integers, you can subtract pointers from integers, you can write to random memory addresses.... Sometimes these things are useful, but most of the time they just lead to your program breaking in an unhelpful, nonobvious way.<p>Python is not that kind of language; it will go to some pains to help you not make mistakes. If you want to do bit-twiddling in Python there are APIs for it, and you could implement a &quot;bit-level cat&quot; using them, but it&#x27;s never going to be the primary use case. Arguably there should be better support for accessing stdin/stdout in binary mode, but that would make it very easy to accidentally interleave text and binary output which would again result in (probably silent) corruption. (Writing a &quot;binary cat&quot; that concatenates two <i>files</i> of bytes would not lead to any of the problems in the linked article - it&#x27;s only trying to use stdin/stdout that&#x27;s causing the trouble in the link).",1450384289

Another example, there&#x27;s gettext integration for autotools, automated tools for translators might rely on autotools, etc.<p>I&#x27;m probably listing the tip of the iceberg as far as network effects. In the Linux/Unix world, autotools is (or at least historically was) what everything and everybody knows how to deal with, and non-autotools is annoyingly nonstandard.<p>Your gyp link there says for example that its main goal is IDE support; a total non-goal for autotools. Unix/Linux C developers largely do not use IDEs. And the autotools goals probably aren&#x27;t in gyp&#x27;s list of priorities. So while they both &quot;build the project&quot; they have pretty different goals.<p>The autotools goals don&#x27;t always make sense anymore. For example the historical idea that the shipped tarball would only depend on POSIX sh and not on any other binary made a lot more sense when people were hand-compiling stuff on their HP-UX than it does today where most binaries come from distributions.<p>If you&#x27;re building a package mostly for Linux and maybe OS-X-as-Unix-compatible, especially one in C/C++ and open source, autotools probably still has a lot to recommend it.",1450383445

And, with OpenMP a #pragma could make that loop run in parallel without any difficulty (long time since I&#x27;ve used it, forgotten the actual code needed to make it happen but it&#x27;s easy).<p><pre><code>  vector_sum([],[]) -> [];\n  vector_sum([A|Atail],[B|Btail]) -> [A+B|vector_sum(Atail,Btail)]\n</code></pre>\n(it&#x27;s been a while since I erlanged, probably messed up the syntax)<p>Each iteration should be independent, but the way we&#x27;ve constructed it it&#x27;s not easily transformed to run in parallel now. In fact, that&#x27;s a bad construction because erlang <i>does</i> have TCE and that recursion isn&#x27;t in tail-call form.<p>EDIT: Also, iteration and recursion are transformable to each other. If you have a language with tail-call elimination, then recursive code with tail-calls should be equivalent to code using more conventional loop structures.<p>If no data needs to be retained between the recursive calls (consider this probably bad code):<p><pre><code>  int[] vector_add(int[] A,B,C, int index) {\n    if(index == C.length) return C;\n    C[index] = A[index]+B[index];\n    return vector_add(A,B,C,index++);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nassuming A,B, and C are all initialized correctly outside this call, it&#x27;s fundamentally identical to (with TCE, actual assembly may not be the same without a bit more care taken in defining the function):<p><pre><code>  int[] vector_add(int[] A,B,C) {\n    for(int i = 0; i < C.length; i++)\n      C[i] = A[i] + B[i];\n    return C;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s a trivial transformation. Now, if we need to somehow retain some data (like an accumulator) it&#x27;s not much harder:<p><pre><code>  int factorial(int N) {\n    int result = 1;\n    for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++)\n      result *= i;\n    return result;\n  }\n\n  int factorial(int N, int result) {\n    if(N = 0) return result;\n    return factorial(N-1, result*N);\n  }\n</code></pre>\ncall the second one as factorial(N, 1), you&#x27;d likely have a wrapper to abstract that out for any user so they only have to call factorial(N).<p>What if the recursion isn&#x27;t a tail-call, how can we transform it? (bad factorial):<p><pre><code>  int bad_factorial(N) {\n    if (N == 0) return 1;\n    return N * bad_factorial(N-1);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAssuming we want to keep this stack, the equivalent code with a loop would be like:<p><pre><code>  int bad_factorial(N) {\n    int result = 1;\n    Stack values = new Stack();\n    for(; N > 0; N--)\n      values.push(N);\n    while(!values.isEmpty())\n      result = values.pop();\n    return result;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat stack we&#x27;ve created replaces the program stack that was used implicitly in the recursive version.

In AGI, you are looking to come up with more universal approaches to mimicking intelligence, rather than bake-an-architecture-solve-a-specific-problem.<p>In particular, this reminds me of some of the operational logic work done in OpenCog (<a href=""http://opencog.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencog.org/</a>) and, especially, Pei Wang&#x27;s Non-Axiomatic Reasoning (<a href=""http://cis-linux1.temple.edu/~pwang/papers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cis-linux1.temple.edu/~pwang/papers.html</a>). I&#x27;ve liked Non-Axiomatic Reasoning for a long time, and this sounds in the same broad area.<p>Pei Wang, incidentally, came up with the best operational definition of intelligence I&#x27;ve seen (and one I apply to other systems and approaches): Intelligence is the ability to act appropriately with limited knowledge and limited resources (including time and space).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, my (published, although very open to change) position is that a layered architecture (akin to old-school subsumption architectures) is probably going to be most effective here. Combining the &#x27;symbol creation&#x27; abilities of a deep neural network with the evidential reasoning, generalisation, and planning capabilities of a cognitive layer will allow us to get the best of both worlds.",1450382960

Worse, in my opinion, the relatively small number of deaths that occurred were almost all traceable to irresponsible adults leaving magnets in places where toddlers could pick them up and swallow them.<p>That&#x27;s still a sore point for me.",1450382589

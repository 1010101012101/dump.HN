You only need to spend a week at a relatively large corporation to clearly see why.<p>Look at what we have now - basecamp, all kinds of free instant chats, group video chats, all kinds of organizational SaS, etc etc etc. Yet we still have ridiculously long email chains that often branch off and start to have a life of their own.<p>Why? Because<p>1) Everyone knows how to use email. Most employees don't want yet another way to communicate.<p>2) Your average office employee is pretty... average. And roughly half of the employees are dumber than that.<p>3) Training is expensive. One quick demo on a projector will not train your employees to use some new software. It's like half-life, 50% will learn after a month, 75% will learn after another month, etc.<p>4) You will always have employees who don't get this new software, many will probably not give a shit about learning a new tech, while they have a perfectly working way of sending a message. They will realize that when they change jobs, chances are, they won't be using this new software. But email will be there.<p>5) It is similar to the craigslist syndrome - it's awful, but everyone uses it, because... everyone uses it.",1352534343

You will never ever get a fine in China for a civil offense (not wearing a seatbelt, spitting on the floor, peeing in public, crossing the street on a red light, etc.). At worse, you are going to get a friendly warning. Traffic policemen are not allowed to chase speeding cars.

I do not take cannabis, and have only ever used it a few times when I was much much younger.)<p>Some people who want to keep cannabis illegal claim they are reducing harm - reducing harm to users, to those users' families, and to wider society.<p>I think there might be causal links between cannabis and mental health problems.  And there are a bunch of self-medication and masking problems too.  But even though I believe this I cannot understand how people do not see the much worse harm that prohibition causes.<p>In England there is a problem with criminal gangs using trafficked workers, keeping those people imprisoned in houses which are then turned into cannabis farms.

It could be reasoned, for instance, that it was more of a fallback mechanism than anything else; it's not very likely fervent Romney supporters were just going to forget about Election Day. The article says the system was conceptualized by two deputies, and complex organizations like this one have many moving parts; it is entirely plausible, imo, that Romney saw this project as a relatively minor component of a much larger organization, something nice to have but not crucial. After all, elections have been won without similar systems in place before.<p>I dislike Romney and did not vote for him (or Obama), but I don't think this should necessarily be seen as a major strategic failure.

We never answer that phone, only let the answering machine take the call and return it in the very rare event it is someone ""real"". But we did not get calls on election day because we live in a state (CA) that both parties assumed (correctly) would give a majority to the President.<p>""Get out the vote"" operations (GOTV) are real and sometimes effective in states where the outcome is expected to be close. In this election there were a small number of these ""swing"" states where both parties thought they had a chance to win.<p>In such states, if the early indications are that the voting is close, the party organization can redouble its efforts to contact known supporters (contributors, or merely people who are registered to that party in the public records, or people who have signed a petition or gotten on the party mailing list somehow) and persuade them to vote.<p>(This is because in the USA, unlike some countries, it is not mandatory to vote, and rarely do even half the eligible voters do so. So if you can persuade a person who was not planning to vote, to do so, that is a net gain of 1 vote.)<p>The purpose of this ""Orca"" system was to collate the reports from volunteers watching the polling places and identify precincts where a few extra votes might make a difference.<p>You can see how serious the effort was, in that the Republicans had mustered 37,000 volunteers willing to do this sort of thankless work: to stand around polling places, politely asking people how they had voted and phone in the counts; or, sit in an office and make telephone calls to people who do not want to be called and politely urge them to go and vote.

Actually I think that learning Lisp/Scheme might have made me a bit of a worse programmer in a way. It made me ""dread"" repetitive code so much to the point that I almost could not do anything with any language that's not highly dynamic.<p>Anyways.<p>I had 2 epiphanies with lisp.<p>1. Macros. Very powerful concept, but in practice difficult to use properly in your code. It's too difficult to reason about what's going on, like say, if you're maintaining or modifying a set of macros. I think it's more useful not as a construct that you would often use in your own code, but as a construct that's very useful for making libraries.<p>2. Continuations. This is not really related to lisp itself, and can be done in other languages, like javascript[0]. Understanding a continuation as an even higher level construct than closures .. and the fact that scheme had it built-in was very mind blowing for me.<p>It makes sense though that a lisp language <i>must</i> have it built-in. It's a concept that's very fundamental to the theory of computation, but in most programming languages it's not explicit at all.<p>Before continuations, I thought no lisp language can ever have equivalents of ""break"", ""return"", or ""continue"". After understanding continuations, I see that these constructs can built using continuations as a basic building block.<p>So this to me suggests that the concept of ""continuation"" is a very basic and fundamental concept that all students of Computer Science should be familiar with. Unfortunately I was never taught about it in University.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers</a>",1352531345

4766142,comment,4763879,4765651,2,0,coffeemug,,,"1. Yes. It's a matter of doing this right, which will take some time.<p>2. Yes. There is no special command, you just combine update and branch (<a href=""http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/#py:control_structures-branch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/#py:control_structures-branch</a>) Here's an example in Python:<p><pre><code>  r.table('foo').get(5).update({ 'bar': r.branch(r['baz'] == 0, 1, 2)})
</code></pre>
This will set attribute bar to 1 if baz is 0, or to two 2 otherwise. Everything is atomic on that document.<p>3. Currently the server doesn't support a sequential (or even loosely sequential) id autogeneration. You'd have to do that on the clients, but using a timestamp for example.<p>4. I don't know yet how to do this really efficiently. It's relatively easy to do on a single shard, but cross-shard boundaries make this really hard.<p>5. Any client can connect to any server. The server will then parse and route the query. There is no central server, everything is peer-to-peer. The client library doesn't know about multiple servers now, so responsibility is on the user to hit a random server. Alternatively you can run ""rethinkdb proxy"" on localhost and connect the client to that. The proxy will then route queries to proper nodes in the cluster.<p>6. In the web UI, if you click on the table and reshard, everything will be rebalanced. You don't even have to add or remove shards, it'll just rebalance data for the number of shards you have. The UI has a bar graph with shard distribution, so you can see how balanced things are.<p>7. Currently there is no authentication support - we expect users to use proper firewall/ssh tunneling precautions.<p>8. Yes, that's how queries get routed. Currently this isn't very smart, but it will get much better over time. If something breaks for you performance-wise, just reach out and we'll fix it.<p>9. No, not yet. If you run eq_join on a small subset of the data (99% of OLTP workloads) it will be very fast. Other joins work ok, but there's A LOT of room for optimization.<p>Phew!",1352531060

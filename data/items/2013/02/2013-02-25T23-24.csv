Then there's also that if companies make their employee's salaries public, there will be a more aggressive and obvious effort to poach employees from competition.

Given that pretty much everybody in certain fields are men, that would imply anybody there is taken seriously. But it seems to be obviously wrong - no one would just accept just any guy coming from the street as a master in any domain just because he's male. If somebody pretends to be a serious practitioner of the field, he would never be accepted as such without demonstrating some proof. I can come in and say, e.g., ""I am a seasoned game developer"", but people would immediately as ""nice, which games did you develop?"", not say ""are you male? oh, then we believe you"".<p>>>>> how their male counterparts are always praised by their peers and superiors for minor accomplishments<p>Being praised for <i>minor</i> accomplishments does not actually mean one is taken seriously - children are often praised for the smallest of accomplishments, but treating one like a child is exactly the opposite of taking seriously.",1361836565

(Scenarios involving an actual $100 seem even less likely, but plausible for a sufficiently egregious wrong.)<p>However, as a game, I'd call it free money no matter the amount; neither player did anything in particular to earn the money other than taking their time to play the game, and I don't see it as even slightly unfair of the first player to offer less money to the second, so I don't see any value in ""punishing"" the first player.  The first player happened to get the better opportunity, and the second player gets to choose between having something or having nothing.  In the game version, I'd place zero value on how much the first player gets.<p>Now, if I thought I could bluff the first player via advance communication into believing that I'd reject the offer if less than a certain amount, I'd certainly do it; however, if they called the bluff, I'll take what I can get.",1361836492

Naturally, humans will resist change and we always look at home a changing scenario benefits ourselves rather than the larger picture. Sudden surge in cost of living due to the need to travel or to leave close-by definitely cannot be ignored.<p>On the other hand, the company would like to reform and revamp itself. In order to keep it on its feet to compete with existing Internet giants, it has to change itself from within. Fundamentally, in every company, the basic unit for it is its people. Employees must be engaged and the new company direction and culture being passed from top to bottom. Thus, the need to work in the same location together to engineer that environment.

My adult experiences have not been any better. I typically cringe when anyone, male or female, publically praises me. It's horrible. So I don't know if I can help with that issue per se.<p>What I have appreciated is when men in positions of power have taken action to genuinely back my work. When I worked at a big company, I managed to impress one of the top three people in the department. I had an entry level job. We barely interacted, but his interaction with me spoke volumes and had I stayed at the company I strongly suspect that would have eventually led to something professionally.<p>I won a departmental award for improving a reference source that was widely used. It was announced at a big meeting that my version of the reference material would be made available via intranet.  Months went by and nothing happened. I began asking around and hitting one dead end after another. After much frustration and run around, I ran into this departmental head in the hallway. I looked his way and he realized I wanted to talk to him. He stopped and came to me and graciously gave me a moment of his time. It was clear to me it was a mark of personal respect. Then he told me to email him the question.<p>I was only hoping he would give me an idea of who else to ask. Instead, he pushed it through personally and it finally went up on the intranet a few days later. I realized after the fact that I made a lot of ignorant, unthinking social gaffs in the process, which he covered over smoothly. I made sure he got a thank you note from both me and a supervisor who ended up being involved (turns out she wrote the reference and unofficially updated it and was finally getting recognition because of my award). I made sure it came from the two of us so there would be zero suggestion that this was ""personal."" I did not want there to be any raised eyebrows over the incident because it was clear to me I had basically gotten a personal favor from on high. I did not want anyone to take any notice of that fact.<p>I knew other men at the company in positions of power. One, in another department, asked me on a date. Another, again in another department, behaved in a way which I interpretted as a mild form of sexual harrassment -- he was attracted but I think married. He looked for excuses to be ""collegially affectionate"" that struck me as motivated by attraction and carefully covered as ""not sexual, honest!"" No other man did anything of professional value for me. I valued that small act of respect and of lending me his professional backing far more than any praise he could have given me. I find that being taken seriously by a man and engaged like that in a meaningful way is much harder to come by than sweet words, which are often essentially empty.",1361835719

I didn't yet have a modem (not before I was 16 or so).<p>So it was trial and error and trying to figure things out. I remember printing a huge assembly program on a dot-matrix printer and going to a friend's place with the listing, explaining him that the routine would work for a few seconds then crash. Then he read the stuff and after a while he found the error : I was using 'jsr' instead of 'jmp', leading to an eventual stack blow.<p>And there were also ""scene disks"" or ""news disk"" from the scene or whatever they were called that we would copy from our friends.  I remember one from some scandinavian group (I was in France), in english, where they were explaining various sorting algorithms and where/when we should use them in intros / demos (before cracked games).<p>It was all a ""black art"" because these stuff (learning assembly to code intros / demos / cracktros [but they weren't called cracktros yet IIRC]) weren't in books, nor in magazines.<p>Then came my first modem (9600 bauds) and pirate BBSes (and writing intros for these BBSes) and suddenly a whole world of knowledge opened to us.  It was magic.<p>Then came my first Internet ISP.  Long before Google and no need for Google : old search engine were sufficient to find gems (Like Fravia's tools of the trade tutorials to learn how to pirate games on the PC, very convenient when you just arrived from the C64 / Amiga scene).<p>And of course there was Usenet.

Heck, the amount of knowledge on Usenet still probably dwarfs SO <i>today</i>.<p>I'd say DejaNews (later bought by Google and more or less became part of Google Groups) was the most important search engine of them all when it came to code.

5282663,comment,5278133,5281780,2,0,caxap,,,"Thanks for your insights, there is a lot of value for me in your post.<p><i>I have an intense dislike for VHDL.</i>
I have yet to meet an engineer who likes it!
I hate it with passion, but it lets me write circuits in the way I want.
Luckily, emacs VHDL mode makes me type less.<p><i>If you've done non-trivial FPGA work you have probably experienced the agony of waiting an hour and a half for a design to compiler and another N hours for it to simulate before discovering problems.</i>
My simulations never took hours.
I use GHDL (an open source tool that converts VHDL into C++) to simulate my code, which is much slower than running Modelsim in a virtual machine.
So I guess that you are working on much larger problems than I do.<p>I have tried using a high level language before writing my circuits in VHDL before.
But the results were not very good, apart from learning a lot more about the actual algorithm/circuit.<p>Either I coded at a too high of a level, which would be impossible in an FPGA (e.g., accessing a true dual port block RAM at 3 different addresses in a clock cycle), or I ended up simulating a lot of hardware just to make sure that it will work.<p>But the point is, no matter which approach I tried, it was painful, so I ended up choosing the workflow that is less painful.<p><i>I'd have to know more specifics to be able to comment beyond a certain level.</i>
I am developing a marker detection system that runs at 100fps, with 640x480 8-bit grayscale images.
First I am doing CCL to find anything in the image that could be a marker.
At the same time, some features are accumulated for each detected component (potential marker).<p>Then the features are used to find which component is a real marker and what's its ID.
And finally, the markers have some spacial information that allows me to find out the position and orientation of the camera.<p>Even though the FPGA that I use is the largest of all Cyclone II FPGAs with 70k LEs, I have to juggle registers and block RAM because it's too small to store all data in the registers, and using up too many registers substantially increases the time to place&route the design.<p><i>I maintain that FPGA's are, fundamentally, still about electrical engineering and not about software development. These, at certain levels, become vastly different disciplines. Once FPGA compilers become 100 to 1,000 times faster and FPGA's come with 100 to 1,000 times more resources for the money the two worlds will probably blur into one very quickly for most applications.</i>
I agree, and I would add that the compilers need to be smarter about parallelizing the code.
So while being able to perform better than the alternatives, the FPGAs are still a pain to develop for.
Even if the compilers are faster, and FPGAs are bigger, writing code for FPGAs feels still more like writing assembly code rather than code that is easily accessible ""for the masses"".
But I would be happy if the compilers become just 10x faster!",1361835372

It's a rather long article, and I'll need to read it when I get home; however, the above section doesn't connect with me.<p>What does ""anthropomorphize"" mean in this context? I understand the term to mean ""to give perceptually human characteristics to"". There are only two routes I can follow with this:<p>1) they mean a human thinking that a smiling animal is a happy animal. And that animals laugh, and grin; and have all the same facial expressions as humans, like one would see in Disney movies.<p>2) they're suggesting that people in the United States believe that animals continue to have emotions that they can express and other sentient thought, have a sense of desire for certain outcomes to be had, and for genuine fear and happiness.<p>The second possibility isn't something that only people from the US do, at all. Long before the United States was the apparent urban environment with lost connection with nature (alluded to in the article in some places), Native Americans ascribed many emotions and intentions and ideas to the animals around them, even calling coyotes tricksters; and in Biblical times, calling someone a ""fox"" had a particular meaning.<p>In short, where is this article getting the idea that humans don't anthropomorphize animals at all stages of life?

5282578,comment,5280484,5282381,1,0,hga,,,"Actually, most non-FMJ bullets who's targets include animals including humans aren't designed to <i>fragment</i> on impact, but to expand, and therefore transfer more of their energy to the target once they get inside.  The useful fragmenting of the latter half of M16 FMJ ammo was unknown until Martin Fackler conclusively demonstrated it in the '80s, a couple of decades after its design.  And we've switched bullets since then (see below), although the new one is thought to have the same wounding mechanism.<p>It's ""useful"" because all that, the breaking in half and possibly fragmenting, provides much more stopping power to an otherwise not very effective round.  If that doesn't happen, the effect is more like getting stuck with a pencil, except that the bullet will turn 180 degrees and likely exit back first; the M16 is infamous for inconsistent stopping power.<p>Note that according to the Hague Convention, our military isn't allowed to <i>design</i> bullets to do this....<p>Fragmentation is very much not a desired feature for creating any type of structural damage; there you want all energy possible to be transmitted to the target.  Even expansion is undesired, because the physical work done to deform the bullet is not available to penetrate the structure and then do further damage once past it.<p>This often gets into the realm of armor piercing (AP) ammo, which has steel or harder metals inside the bullet, sometimes comprising almost all of it, sometimes as a smaller penetrator, like the steel rod inside the .30-06 ammo that I've read became the standard for the US towards the end of WWII (although that was in part because steel was cheaper than lead), or the steel pellet that's in the 5.56 NATO SS109, M855 green tip for the US, design bullet (which is really machine gun ammo/designed to satisfy a silly requirement of piercing a metal helmet at a very long distance, it's not really good ammo for rifles for a whole bunch of reasons).<p>With the exception of 5.56 NATO AP, there should be no differences in wounding capability, larger caliber bullets don't depend on deformation for wounding.  Our M995 black tip ammo ... well, look at this picture: <a href=""http://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=3&f=16&t=562820"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=3&f=16&t=56...</a><p>I assume the bullet is not as likely to break at the cannelure, that the aluminum boot in which it sits is no more likely to cause damage ... but that would have to be tested.  Certainly gunners would try to avoid wasting ammo by using AP on humans....<p>Then we get to exotic stuff that includes an explosive payload, normally 20 mm ammo and above, generally intended for aircraft until we get into serious anti-armored vehicle ammo.  You're <i>really</i> not supposed to use that on humans, but of course that's not so well observed in wars.

For example, I am a member of our IBC (Institutional Biosafety Committee). We approve all scientific research done on our campus for safety reasons (chemical and biological). However, the legalities behind this are a bit unclear. The NIH and institution require this board, and you can't do research if you don't get our approval, but what is unclear is what would happen if something unfortunate occurred? Right now, we have legal backing from the institution which should cover all scenarios, but in speaking with said legal council, we are actually all personally liable for consequences from approvals we sign off on. Board members at other institutions have been personally sued, so there is precedent for this happening. However, with the backing of the University legal team it is much easier to swallow. It is difficult to see how Microryza will be able to replicate this without documenting full legal support.<p>I am not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, and I really like the concept.

For females, impostor, feelings had low correlations with impulsivity and need for change, consistent with the usual description of impostors as cautious and unlikely to engage in risk-taking. For males, on the other hand, impostor feelings were associated with high impulsivity and a strong need for change, as well as a low need for order.

He's suggesting that remote working wasn't working for them, so they nixed it.<p>But this is the issue I take with the article and the action from Yahoo - remote working isn't a ""it does/doesn't work for them/us"" type of thing. Remote working either does or does not work, and you are either doing it correctly or doing it incorrectly. Since there is evidence out there that shows that remote working can be just as effective as in-office working (and, in many cases, more effective), I'm left to assume that Yahoo was just doing it wrong.<p>I do not believe that the concept of remote fluctuates in its performance so greatly - the concept is sound. It's the implementation that is flawed - implementation at companies like Yahoo. There are ways to do it right, and there are ways to do it wrong; Yahoo chose the latter.<p>So, now the problem is this: when you find that your company has been failing at something, do you try to fix it or do you choose to cut it? Many things that Yahoo has been failing at, in terms of business, have not been cut. Instead, they're trying to fix them. When it comes to benefits for the employees, however, they're more than willing to cut those benefits.<p>In my mind, the correct action isn't to cut the remote working program, but to find what you're doing wrong and fix it.

What is ""portion control"" if nothing other than an unscientific way of saying ""hit/eat your macros""?<p>I do have a saying, if your only go is ""not be a fatass"", then sure, there are many, many suboptimal ways to approach this problem. However, if you care about more than just not being a fatass, there is more to think about. Not much more, just a little bit. Overall, though, it is REALLY easy to get this right if you just can articulate your actual real goal.",1361833359

Once Amazon and big e-tailers figure out they're being crawled for profits or to the detriment of their sales, you can bet they will restrict access and charge a fee. Seems like a good idea, and I'm sure many of us have thought of the same idea, but it's easy for any of the big guys to easily block their crawler whenever they wish. Crowdsourcing works to a certain extent but that's what deal sites are for.<p>I remember a real estate startup crawling listing prices from many real estate sites for maket analysis.

But as soon as they enter the Apple ecosystem, they're gone.  I have no idea how many people view the app's store page.  I have no idea where they're coming from (other than from my website).  I have no idea what the conversion rates in the final stage (""download"") are, for users from different sources. I have no idea how effective the app description is - or, if I change it, whether it helps or hurts conversion rates.<p>I can maybe try to do some IP matching between visits to the website and people who launch the app, but this is very limited - for one, it only applies to users who download the app through my website; for another, there's no guarantee the IP will be the same.<p>Any ideas?  Most of the advice for iPhone app promotion tends to be ""get blogs to talk about you"", which is fine, but doesn't really help optimize the process.

1362779,comment,1361163,1361546,0,0,kragen,,,"> So does that mean that any company with patents should just suck it up if someone infringes instead of defending their IP? Regardless of what you think of the validity of patent, it was granted and MS has a right to defend it.<p>People should do what is moral, not act as selfishly as they can without overstepping the bounds of the law. Enforcing patents against software is immoral. As Bill Gates famously pointed out, if software had been considered patentable when Microsoft started, the industry would have been at a standstill decades ago.<p>The fact that it's possibly legal does not make it moral. You can list any number of actions that are legal but immoral if you think about it for two minutes.<p>> If you put in time doing research and then spend time and money patenting that research because you believe it to be innovative (subjective), would you just suck it up and ""try to make your own software better"" if someone copied your work?<p>No copying is being alleged here. Presumably people who can see that enforcing patents against software is immoral would do exactly what you're saying, and furthermore would rarely spend time and money patenting in the first place.",1274312780

Yes there are startups with a small number of people that are all pretty even keel but as soon as you get to a certain size you'll get opposing interests and that's where blame comes from.  The blame game is a political game played by people trying to get leverage over other people in order to get more resources.  It's stupid but it's the reality of the world. If you don't see it you just aren't high up enough to be the one fighting for resources.  Because as someone who read about Microsoft as a kid I know it was happening at Microsoft (Silverberg/Alchin?)<p>As far as brand, that's just human nature.  Look at the side of any Grocery Store brand and you'll see the same ingredients as the big brands.

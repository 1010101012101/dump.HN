I was a network admin (NetWare 2.15c), and there was a fat, unused internet pipe and several unused phone lines. I started to mess around with Linux (Slackware kernel 0.97 I think), and after two weeks I had it talking to a Hayes modem. Voila, instant ISP! A little while later I installed Slirp, and it became my personal dial-up connection for many, many years.<p>Before I left that job in 1995, I moved the server (headless) to a broom closet (wrong of me, I know, I know). Knowing gov&#x27;t culture, no one would mess with something like that. It was up and running at least until 1998 or so, at which point I moved to another country, and when I moved back, I no longer had the dial-up number.

Maybe not Blue-state (on this map) cheap, but definitely tan -- since I know more than one person that gets by on $15-20 and has a two bedroom or better.<p>No surprise, extremely rural areas are cheaper and states with massive urban areas are more expensive. Wyoming is cheaper than Colorado despite being similar-ish states next to one another. In Wyoming, you&#x27;re glad to see another human, in Colorado, a similar sized state with 10x the population, there&#x27;s a lot more people around.<p>There&#x27;s a similar pattern with Oregon and Washington.<p>So it&#x27;s basically a population map [1] with a few outliers - Alaska, Hawaii, Pennsylvania and perhaps Michigan and Illinois.<p>It would probably just be better to focus in on those weird states and show <i>why</i> they&#x27;re weird -- above or below their expected categories.<p>1 - <a href=""https://xkcd.com/1138/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/1138/</a>",1433044698

His competitors are towing the extremist line, for example competing with each other over who can be most hawkish; he&#x27;s not and it may cost him. Also, Fox News (and the Wall St Journal) have enormous influence among those voters and the desire and track record of nakely using it to promote their favorites; it&#x27;s difficult to win without being on their good side.

I&#x27;m seeing houses going for 20% prices <i>above</i> asking prices, aggressive bidding wars, all cash deals - mostly from buyers who have no intent to actually live in those houses. If you search Zillow you will find tons of houses getting sold in 1 week and then immediately put back in market as rental properties. The rents are usually approximately set at 5% of house prices. This clearly means investors are considering real estate as something that has great returns while being well inflation protected. It&#x27;s simply much better option that things likes long term CDs or TIPS etc. If this investment efforts are actually successful, most people - even in upper middle class - should expect to be able to only rent.",1433043794

The left claims to want a more European style governance model but fail to accept that the EU does not have one healthcare system, does not have one schooling system, and does not have one college system.<p>When you concentrate all power into a small point it makes manipulating that power much easier for the elites. No longer do they have to bribe politicians in each state, just the ones in Washington DC. The founding fathers knew this (they experienced this with the British Monarchy) and that&#x27;s why they intended on having a very limited federal government that had little control over social programs and whose main purpose was to see that states take it upon themselves to enforce rights provided by the constitution.<p>Remember when we integrated schools? The left would like you to believe the DOE is some kind of federal schooling system when in fact all it really does is issue pell grants. The federal government did not take over the schooling sector. The only thing the federal government did was step in when a state refused to integrate.<p>I urge leftists to reconsider their position. I&#x27;m in favor of social programs like single payer healthcare, but having the federal government do it is just asinine. The federal government needs to pass a bill that makes healthcare a right, then leave it up to the states to implement free healthcare. Those that don&#x27;t will be forced to, just like we did when some schools refused to integrate.<p>If you hate too big to fail companies, then why allow one entity to monopolize a whole sector of the economy? As soon as one of these huge social programs fails, down goes the whole economy. It happened in the USSR and it could happen here. Just let the states handle it like they do in the EU. That way, when one states social programs fail it doesn&#x27;t bring down the whole economy. Notice that this is a compromise. The left still gets it&#x27;s healthcare while the right still gets a small federal government. It&#x27;s a win-win. Unfortunately both the left and right would like you to believe that any compromise is giving into the other side, they must perpetuate the idea that you only have one right choice and that if you&#x27;re not with them you&#x27;re completely against them.",1433042739

9632880,comment,9631825,9631825,0,0,omegaham,,,"One of the biggest reasons why we have scientific magic in RPGs is that it gives agency to the player. When magic is a relatively mundane tool, it becomes an <i>option</i> that a player can rely on, and that is really important. If magic is unknowable, then it forces the <i>GM</i> to use the magic rather than the players. This takes agency away from the players and makes it more of a movie (zero-player game) than a game.<p>Personally, I find the &quot;scientific for mundane things, but mythical for greater things&quot; model to be the most desirable, because it&#x27;s directly applicable to how we view magic in the real world - any sufficiently advanced technology is viewed as magic. If you show an 18th-century machinist a laser-etched piece, he&#x27;ll be mystified. And as you gain wisdom, knowledge, and experience, the current mystery slowly unravels, to reveal still more mysteries beyond.<p>So, the mechanism to cast a small fireball should be mundane and understandable. In contrast, the fact that 500 years ago, a great sage burned an entire forest to ash should be mystical and unknowable... for now. Maybe it will always be a mystery. Maybe the method will become known but shown to be impossible with current abilities. Maybe the magician of the group <i>will</i> attain that power, but at some great cost. It&#x27;s up to the GM.<p>This way, we get the best of both worlds - the delight and intrigue of mysterious things, <i>and</i> the agency of being able to manipulate known rules to solve problems.",1433041629

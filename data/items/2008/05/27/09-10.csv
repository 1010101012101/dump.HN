200829,comment,200728,200728,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"OK, so reading this article is enough to thoroughly convince one to rethink the usage of Singletons. But what other design patterns would you guys recommend? Most of the common design patterns are some form of Singleton implementation or the other and suffer many of the same drawbacks Steve points out in the article - what are the alternatives?<p>(I've been making do with custom interactor classes that perform object sharing by using linked-list of class instances with a custom ""mapper"" and though it works great it's really hard to explain to anyone).<p>Also - any books you guys would recommend as an alternative to Design Patterns?",1211882077

200826,comment,200451,200451,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Nice article.<p>So take a little time and hypothesize about your market and marketing plan.<p>I believe what is unsaid is that you iterate, and both the product ""code first"" and the plan ""marketing"" continue to iterate and evolve.<p>Over time your idea of who your market is becomes one with your solution and your sales.<p>Seems like a non-controversial and practical piece of advice.

I personally use <a href=""http://tipit.to"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tipit.to</a> because I can actually get money out of that service, making it much more interesting as an alternative to an advertisement revenue stream. Tipjoy is not free and doesn't allow you to get any money out of the service, which make it a harder sell for me.<p>Secondly I personally think a tip service should definitely be a very social enterprise, and I have the feel that Tipit is that a bit more, with their ""pledging of tips"", etc. I think you'd just have to go and see for yourself.",1211881066

200810,comment,200670,200789,0,0,LPTS,,,"The largest cause of disease progression in HIV is adherence between 70 and 90 percent.  Hypertension, Diabetes, etc.  All these long term problems have adherence rates less then 70%.   Resistance is low on the list for reasons for nonadherence.  More common reasons include forgetting (because human brains are lousy alarm clocks), not getting refills, not renewing the rx, and not being able to afford it.  One problem that happens is people fail to take meds as prescribed, get sicker, go back to the doctor, get a higher dose, take it right, and take too much since the doctor was operating under the assumption that the previous dose was taken.<p>This is responsible for about 10% of hospital and 24% of nursing home admittances, at a cost of 100 billion.  There are many 2007 and 2008 medical journal articles about how this is a huge problem desperate for a solution.  Its not that people don't want to take the med, in most cases.  Its that it takes more then wanting to adhere to make it happen, and the medical industry has no good solution.",1211879491

You'll have to try it, make mistakes, learn from them, make mistakes in the opposite direction and so forth.<p>People should build some personal throwaway projects and cram in every design pattern they know. That should at least get them started on the learn/mistake cycle. At least it did so for me. Though in my last project I was totally abusing the factory pattern while all the while chanting ""I shall not use patterns when they are not necessary"" :blush:",1211878965

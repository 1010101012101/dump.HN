RMS, however, saw which way the wind was blowing, and helped codify the free software ideals for posterity.  If it was not for him, we may very well not have Linux or any significant open source software today.  We may think he's a wacko, but his extremism is necessary in a world where our freedoms are bought and sold by monied interests.  He represents the public good in the software world in a way that benefits everyone (including many businesses and almost every startup).

We all owe him a lot, and we should demonstrate that by contributing back to open source as much as we can.<p>That said, I think he's totally out of his league on the software as a service model.  At the very least he needs to spend a lot more time mulling it over.  As far as I see it, freeness of javascript more or less meaningless in a web application.  The fact is that the barriers to making web applications free are much higher, and there are a lot more legitimate arguments as to why it shouldn't be free.  Of course Stallman would argue for freedom under all circumstances, and he's right that web applications do present a risk to freedom of software in the long run, but I don't think it's as easy to argue from his idealogical standpoint when it comes to web apps.

The time it takes someone knowledgeable to do something difficult vs the time spent on more mundane issues where amount of knowledge doesn't really come into play?<p>But I see what you are saying.  The Microsoft provided Windows software maintenance environment is really far behind every Linux distribution.  If you have a network of non-mobile machines that mount root via NFS, the work of the admin to install hard-to-install (because it's not available as a package) software doesn't necessarily even require creating package -- you install it on the root.  I did this with some one-off stuff we needed that ended up in /usr/local.  Voila, everyone has it.  And while we all know this kind of software management (packageless) leads to a ""messy"" system, it's actually easier to pay off that technical debt because you can spend time later to provide a whole new, cleanly managed environment for your NFS root users WITHOUT causing them any downtime at all to do the upgrade.  In a properly managed environment, the apparently problematic 3rd party software is just that: apparently problematic.  You do the hard stuff ONCE, and that scales out to X number of machines (mobile or not).  With Windows, you keep doing the hardstuff over and over and over because each machine diverges and there are so many things you need to touch during the install, and even things like installation are not nearly as automate-able as they are in Linux.<p>What would be really interesting (and I care about this not very much since I don't do even small Windows network deployments anymore, nor do I have plans to do so in the future) is some kind of installwatch style system for Windows, that re-packages installed software, installed with setup.exe, into, let's say, RPMs, including {pre,post}-install scripts that modify the registry (this is possible, I've used tools that do registry diffs).  You'd have to have a clean master Windows machine to do this properly (easily solvable with virtualization), but it could be the difference between night and day when managing Windows installations compared with Microsoft's massive updates and each vendor's own installation method.",1237760198

The next day when I logged on things were completely back to normal - AND my old friend lists had been restored.<p>One of the first things I noticed was that my friends lists had been deleted - and subsequently they no longer applied to photos privacy settings.  Unfortunately I don't remember how or why I noticed this, maybe it was part of the exploratory feeling you get when something gets deactivated for a week and you want to make sure everything is OK.<p>The situatation also applied to my friends whose friends lists I was on.  For example, if my friends didn't allow anyone to see tagged photos, I couldn't see their photos.  But if my friend had just not allowed their 'Work friends' list to see their photos, and I was a Work friend, I could see their photos because my account no longer appeared under their friends lists entitled 'Work friends' - at least that's what I presume to have happened.<p>I do not recall if this affected the Networks as well.  I don't recall if I was able to see normally private photos from strangers in other regional, high school or University networks.  If it did, I probably would have a recollection of it because I did do some experimenting to see how far the bug extended.<p>Did I find any steamy secrets?  Yes, in the form of insights into the nature of the human spirit and desire for privacy.  And no, in regards to the underwhelming nature of photos.  I should probably hang around in more exciting circles.",1237759367

I hadn't understood the power of Twitter at all until the other day I was reading a blog where the author referred to someone as @handle.  My name is not unique: but, if we had a service that got enough adoption that gave everyone a globally unique string identifier, you could unambiguously reference real people across any medium.  That's really powerful, and I think it's just starting to dawn on us the different ways we could use that.  I still don't see an obvious monetization strategy; but people said the same thing about Google in 2000, so I don't want to be one to talk on that.",1237759251

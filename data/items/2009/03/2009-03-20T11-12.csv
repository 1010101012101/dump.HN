I'm not sure if Mario would hit it on the scale they were working at, but if he does, that would certainly skew the results.<p>Also, it is interesting to note that the characters in SMB2 don't seem to have the same amount of gravity on them.

(A pic18 actually has a very low recommended source impedance - 2.5k ohm, which can bite you if you're not careful, but that doesn't seem to be a concern here.)<p>If you're going to use an op-amp, you'd be better off using a different configuration, say with the thermistor as the feedback resistor, to get a linear response.<p>Taking a look at the circuit on your page, it seems like you could drop R9 and R3 (while changing the value of R8), as the function of those 3 resistors is only to feed a fixed current into the node of pin 2 (which is always held at 0V by the op amp). In fact, if you play around a bit, you should be able to get the proper range using only one op amp, at which point you can use a 5V rail-to-rail amplifier and get rid of that dual supply.",1237549182

524769,comment,523131,524693,0,0,nreece,,,"Sure, I can give you many examples. Here are some of them:<p>Google Search - At a time when Web search (portals) was dominated by the likes of Altavista, Excite, Yahoo etc., Google focused only on the search side of things. A minimal homepage, no groups/usenet, no frills. Just better search.<p>Twitter - They focused on short messaging (status updates). Unlike Facebook (who also offer status updates), they have no photo albums, no groups, no advanced privacy controls. Just simple messaging in 140 chars.<p>Vimeo - They focused on online videos. YouTube already dominates this space. Vimeo on the other hand kept it simple - allowing only videos created by the users - user generated visual content. No 3rd party videos, no copyrighted content. Just original creative work.<p>Campaign Monitor - They are a great example of a slick yet simple service. No fancy marketing bullshit. Pure simple email newsletter delivery with only the necessary tracking tools and highly customizable newsletter designing templates. Pay as you go, no monthly fees. Send newsletters to 5, or 100,000 people.<p>GitHub - Source control and code repository is nothing new, but GitHub offers just what's needed. Nothing more, nothing less.<p>iPod Shuffle - Music on the move? Been there, done that. No radio, no fancy controls, no digital display. Under $50.<p>Posterous - Blogging started a new wave of online expression and information sharing. How about a dead simple place to post everything, through email. No fancy admin panel, no hassles with updates and templating.<p>Feedity (<i>shameless plug</i>) - Create instant RSS feeds, for pretty much any public webpage. No filtering, no fancy UI (pipes!), no signup required. Today, four of our paying customers are state government offices.<p>All these products/startups are notable and profitable (ok, except Twitter, but they are not far from it). What do they have in common? In my opinion, they started by offering less. And, less is more.<p>Marketing is a different, and unrelated (to this discussion), topic altogether. My viewpoint is to keep the feature-set simple.",1237548612

I went to college here and there at the cheapest places I could find. Now she gets hit up for money all of the time, and I never hear from the three colleges I attended.<p>Assuming we studied the same thing with the same perceived value (we didn't, but this is a thought experiment), why should she feel obligated to support her experience and I not feel obligated to support mine?<p>I guess the rub here is ""perceived value."" Can a case be made that the perceived value in the same education from a different institution be worth supporting all of your life? If so, don't we already do that with federal research grants and tuition support for students?<p>I have the same confusion when school kids come by raising money for a new gym or something. So I pay taxes to the local government that then allocates money to the school, but that's not enough, so then the schools use my kindness towards kids to raise even more money for their pet projects?<p>It's not enough that colleges are now big businesses, that most professors don't spend their time in the classroom, that tuition costs have risen far faster than inflation -- now we're expected to hold some special place in our wallets for them as well?<p>I guess.

It was originally released in Japan under the title Doki Doki Panic (I had to look up the name). The North American / European version of SM2 was a rebranded version of DDP. According to the stats in the article, Mario is taller and exposed to higher gravity than the other early games which sounds about right (the gameplay definitely felt different).<p>As a side note, I don't understand the title Mario Brothers.

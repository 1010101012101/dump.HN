This suggests that your BATNA to not receiving an equitable amount of the company is, approximately, that you set up shop down the road and very quickly that shop is everything that this now-hollowed-out-husk once was, except with a cap table which reflects reality.  You may not realize this, but this is one of the oldest stories in consulting.&quot;<p>Given that it&#x27;s your relative, I&#x27;d weight &quot;Hmm I probably don&#x27;t want to damage relationship with X&quot; against the economic reality that X is exploiting you while adding no value to the business.

I&#x27;ve been involved in a project and have a number of concerns:<p>Firstly, the main drivers of this i.e. Greg Young/Udi Dahan/Particular are trying to sell a product and consultancy. While there is nothing wrong with this, there is a significant cost and the motivation to use this architecture is marketing driven rather than logical gains. Make sure it is appropriate for your organisation. 95% of organisations it probably isn&#x27;t. It wasn&#x27;t for ours but overzealous architecture proponents bought the marketing.<p>The cognitive load is immense compared to a smaller system architecture. Every change results in masses of friction, cost and time. Your agility will be destroyed pretty quickly. Also due to the cross-cutting concerns, there is no escape from it other than to port everything away.<p>The products to support it are generally immature, low quality and opinionated to the point that it&#x27;s impossible to integrate cleanly on anything but a greenfield. Expect friction.<p>There are better gains to be had from changing your architecture to a purely service model (I hate the term, but microservices) and skip the whole concept.<p>However if there&#x27;s one thing I have learned that Command-Query Separation is a good model for isolation.

10190089,comment,10180277,10189768,0,0,wfo,,,"I think the ways we are using the phrase &#x27;economically efficient&#x27; are different, and that&#x27;s where much of the disagreement lies. In fact I&#x27;d reject the notion of the existence of a universal objective welfare function. If you include the welfare of slaves in your calculation certainly I&#x27;d agree that the system is inefficient; but since when has any slave owner done that?<p>It&#x27;s actually an extremely uncommon (nonexistent) left wing view that welfare is maximized with some people enslaved. Literally nobody believes that and I certainly hope for your sake that you don&#x27;t believe anyone believes that and are just trying to be incendiary. It is a very common view among most people (since it&#x27;s the truth) that the welfare of /certain people/ is maximized with /certain other people/ enslaved. And then we can conclude if the first group has economic power and is subject to no regulation and act according to maximizing their economic welfare, they will implement it.<p>The contention is that your position, that businesses should refuse to operate in countries which regulate rights into existence since these rights have costs which hurt the bottom line of the business, if adopted leads directly and immediately to slavery. Slavery is unquestionably disgusting and reprehensible, so therefore your position, which leads to an unacceptable result, cannot be accepted.<p>So I&#x27;m suggesting that the /subjective/ welfare of people in a position to own slaves (wealthy business owners) is maximized under slavery. And from that I conclude the maximization of the welfare of wealthy business owners -- the natural result of unfettered capitalism -- is something to be categorically rejected. So we need fetters.",1441781414

The defining aspect of silly theories isn&#x27;t just that they involve conspiracies.<p>However many silly theories do wind up involving conspiracies, because assuming the existence of a conspiracy is the easiest way to explain away any differences between your theory and observable reality.<p>Think that President Obama comes from Mars? Well why is there a birth certificate that says he was born in Hawaii? Easy: someone faked it. Why didn&#x27;t the records office notice it was faked? They were in on it. Why hasn&#x27;t one of the President&#x27;s medical examinations shown up his Martian physiology? The doctor is also in on the conspiracy. Why didn&#x27;t anyone notice his spaceship landing? They did, the government covered it up. And so forth. There&#x27;s practically <i>no</i> fact you can&#x27;t explain away by asserting a giant conspiracy between all the people who tell us this fact.<p>Ridiculous conspiracy theories can usually be distinguished from vaguely sensible ones by looking at whether the asserted conspiracy would actually be a sensible way for the purported actors to achieve their goals. Ridiculous people claim that George W Bush plotted 9/11 as a way to achieve... something, but always some goal that could have been achieved in a much easier and less risky way.<p>On the other hand, the idea that the CIA would build a giant ship to raise a Russian submarine while pretending it&#x27;s for some other purpose? That&#x27;s actually a sensible way for them to achieve an actual goal.",1441781352

It hasn&#x27;t for the past 20 years, the SFBA has experienced it twice.<p>London and Vancouver are created by loose investor immigrant laws and tax incentives for the rich.  You could get Canadian citizenship as an &#x27;investor&#x27; by basically buying a house until very recently. On top of that, you get special tax treatment for the first several years of citizenship if your rich by Canada.  Canada&#x27;s real estate bubble never popped.<p>China has a large amount of ongoing capital flight, Vancouver is nice and stable, and a relatively quick flight back to China. Vancouver has a huge Chinese immigrant community.  All of this combined plus the general Canadian real estate bubble & laws creates Vancouver.<p>---------------<p>London is even worse. In the UK they have a nom-dom resident tax law, where you basically just pay a flat tax of ~$40k/yr and have no taxation on your foreign income as a rich person. London is a hub city for the world too. The UK also has very low property tax rates. All of these facts combined create London.<p>If the UK wants to reverse London, then getting rid of non-dom tax laws, adding wealthy-only property taxes and treating them as normal tax residents will reverse the trend fairly quickly.<p>--------------<p>The USA is not an attractive place to be rich resident, unless your wealth comes from a US corporation. The USA has a high relative tax load, citizenship based taxation (only place in the world!), harsh anti-corruption / anti-money laundering laws, a very powerful, wealthy and motivated tax collection agency, a global financial surveillance apparatus, estate tax, a long and annoying immigration process and so on.  All of this puts a damper on the super wealthy making another London.<p>Also the state of a place doesn&#x27;t really matter, the &#x27;investors&#x27; would be interested in molding crack houses.  They have the money to turn it into whatever they want.  You can do a total rebuild in SF as long as you keep the same square footage.

The work that was done at Valve in 2012-2013 on VR hardware and software was critical to the success of Oculus.  Valve created a complete VR demo that was shown to Andreessen-Horowitz near the end of 2013, and was a deciding factor in their decision to invest, as well as Facebook&#x27;s decision to buy.  At that time, the best hardware created by Oculus did not have 6DOF, high-resolution tracking.  It did not have low-persistance, globally-illuminated displays.  It did not have proper lens distortion correction.  It did not have presence.  Basically, all of the hardware factors that have made modern VR exciting were discovered and developed by the team at Valve.  Unfortunately, Valve was not able to capitalize or commercialize all of this work, and basically just gave it away through a very awkward interaction.  Source:  I worked there on VR.  Of course, they are now working with HTC on the Vive, which is really great, and is going to give Oculus major competition.<p><a href=""http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%2...</a>",1441780202

And if your reason for starting a business is just to make money, it seemed like you are destined to fail. \nHowever, after reading some biographies of successful entrepreneurs, it does seemed like making money WAS the main motivation and they weren’t particularly &quot;passionate&quot; about the problems they were trying to solve. A good example would be Dennis Felix. In his book &quot;How To Get Rich&quot;, he mentioned that the biggest myth regarding getting rich - “The first is the claim that people did not set out to get rich but became rich by &#x27;accident&#x27;. &#x27;Oh, I only did what I love to do and woke up one day to find myself wealthy.&#x27; That sort of thing. It may have happened. But very rarely in my experience”. From Paul Getty’s How To Be Rich, “Almost without exception, there is only one way to make a great deal of money in the business world–and that is in one’s own business.” And finally, From John D Rockefeller’s Biography, he was initially selling meat or some sort but changed to the refining oil business as soon as he realised that it made more money.<p>Thoughts?<p>[1] https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/good-and-bad-reasons-to-become-an-entrepreneur-decf0766de8d",1441780179

(Name, Age, HourlyWage) might be a relation where Name comes from Strings, Age comes from Ints and HourlyWage comes from Floats.<p>So, we might have a couple facts like:\n(Bob, 45, 14.50)\n(Jill, 19, 112.95)\n(Jim, 7, 1337.0)<p>Now, the repository of facts can provide a solver that answers questions.  You define some constraints like HourlyWage > 100.0 AND Age < 10 and it finds the facts that match the constraints.  It&#x27;s more complicated than that and the Alice book explains the mathematical foundations well.<p>And the database remains a repository.  You can add data to it.  The repository may enforce the relations and reject facts that don&#x27;t fit the domain of their values.  Maybe it has uniqueness constraints on certain fields, etc. etc.<p>Beyond that it&#x27;s mostly additional features.  More complicated relational operators.  Better query abstraction.  Optimizations to solve queries more efficiently (query planning, etc.) Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability guarantees.  Clustering and networked operations. So on and so forth in the spirit of CTM.<p>My intuition is that the mathematical foundation is fairly pure.  So even &quot;non-relational databases&quot; could be viewed as implementing some non-standard form of the relational model.",1441779503

I would say the kernel of programming languages is more practically something like C, assembly, or machine language. Kernel implies containing the core functionality, the building blocks. Van Roy&#x27;s kernel language does seem to contain core ideas for ideal programming languages, even though it doesn&#x27;t seem to translate well to existing hardware / machine language.<p>After reading a bit about it I started to think of it as pseudocode for programming languages, and I thought I&#x27;d share some results from my searching based on that idea [1].<p>&quot;In terms of the kernel language itself, it is in fact its own programming language, a sort of &quot;runnable pseudocode&quot; that is executable in the Mozart/Oz platform.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting link I found by searching for database pseudocode [2]. This delves into the topic of &quot;NoSQL&quot;, which might be helpful in your database basics research, but it also covers other database basics.<p>I am also not very skilled nor experienced with databases, but based on your request, one database that comes to mind for me is Berkeley DB.

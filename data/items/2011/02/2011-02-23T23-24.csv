2256345,comment,2256165,2256165,0,0,alphaoverlord,,,"I'm interested in learning how DrChrono is planning to market to physicians.<p>I personally think DrChrono is going for a diminishing slice of the healthcare pie. The current trend in healthcare is that a decreasing proportion of physicians are working in small private practices - the cost of healthcare infrastructure, logistics, and billings means large practices and hospital based have significant savings on scale and tremendous bargaining power with insurance and etc. This kind of app, with the appointment scheduler and prescription system, seems very much geared to small private practices.<p>I imagine this kind of system will make limited leeway in large healthcare practices and large academic institutions - this is the difference between enterprise software and web applications. Epic and the like, despite being aesthetically unpleasing and rather cumbersome, is dominating this segment of the market. It's not even a question of cost - these solutions cost much more than competitors, but there is a perceived level of stability and a proven track-record. In both culture and priorities, I think YC companies are not as well prepared to offer enterprise solutions. Large institutions are fickle, full of politics, and without a dedicated sales team, difficult to sell to.<p>They are definitely going for the ""meaningful use"" incentives as part of healthcare reform - the healthcare reform gives physicians incentives to adopt an EHR (electronic health record) system and going for the sex appeal of using ipads -  but I am wondering if that is enough incentive to adopt an electronic health system. Personally, I type 1000x faster on a keyboard than with an iPad, and speed would be an consideration - ie. even as a physician-in-training (hypothetically with comfort in technology), I would have to look hard to decide whether to use such a system.<p>As a medical student, don't think there is enough of an market for general primary care physicians and not enough specificity (currently) to most subspecialities. There are a lot of older physicians that have limited comfort in medicine. I would imagine there is a good market for concierge medicine practices - the kind of places that already have iPads and are interested in distinguishing themselves from the market.",1298505349

I assume what he is giving us is method names written in Java with ""Treasure Island"" as the single argument that return a value indicating the likelihood that ""Treasure Island"" is what the method name refers to. This is extraordinarily interesting. However, it is not at all clear which methods are chosen and why, if they are run in some sort of sequence or simultaneously, etc .<p>Case in point (3) : ""Builds different semantic queries based on phrases, keywords and semantic assumptions."" This is very vague but indicates that Watson generate a set of queries which it runs against its own internal search engine ranking answers presumably based on the quality of the initial search and the confidence of the answer. Would be very very cool to have an example.<p>All in all, wets the appetite but leaves one wishing for more hearty fare (or a job at IBM!).",1298503990

Note, by swede I mean vegetable, not someone from Sweden.<p>I've put the measures in US imperial as the majority of the site have it - I cook metrically, but roughly so you'll be fine with these or converting back to metric.<p>Bash the cumin and coriander in a pestle and mortar for a while, then add the ginger and salt and keep bashing till you have a nice paste. It doesn't need to be perfect - a rough paste is fine, but it needs to be fairly mashed and mixed up.<p>Heat some oil in a pan (I use sunflower or olive) and brown the shank off in the pan - this is purely for aesthetic purposes, you don't have to do this but your lamb might look a bit grey otherwise. If you do this, just brown it for a minute or two and put it in the pot.<p>Add your onions to the pot, along with the spice paste (you might want to rub it onto the lamb, maybe not), harissa (I generally smear this over the lamb but it doesn't affect the taste much), tomatoes, cinammon stick and stock.<p>Put the crockpot on low for 8 hours or high for 4. I cannot stress this enough - your meat will be so much better the longer you cook it. My record is 16 hours for lamb, you'll reach the point where the shank just falls apart and the meat falls off the bone around the 7 hour mark on low. Cooking it on high is fine, but it affects the meat more and more importantly sends the stock over boiling point. You won't lose too much but you will lose some. If you put it on low it really doesn't matter how long you cook it for, it simply will not burn, so feel free to put this on the night before if you really want to, all you'll do is get even more tenderness from the meat.<p>Ok, now between an hour to half an hour beforehand (closer to an hour) add the apricots and figs, make sure they're in the sauce and put up on high if the lid's off for a while or you only have half an hour, low if you barely took the lid off and you have an hour.<p>About 15 minutes beforehand, it's time to make the accompanying lemon and mint couscous if you want. Get a bowl and add some couscous (bear in mind that it will swell to between two and three times it's size). Bulgur wheat or quinoa are fine as alternatives (and may be cheaper depending on where you are).<p>Add 4 tablespoons of olive oil to the couscous along with the juice of half to a whole mid-sized lemon (depending on how much you like lemon). Add a cup of chicken stock, roughly enough to cover the couscous along with some salt and pepper, cover the bowl and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. If you run out of water add some more. It's ok to stir it up as well. After 10 minutes drain off the excess couscous, add 3 tablespoons of freshly chopped mint (you can use parsley instead if you want) and optionally add another two teaspoons of coriander and mix it in with a fork. Using the fork is important as this 'fluffs up the couscous. Bring the couscous to the table with a nice big spoon as the smell of the lamb will be driving anyone else at home wild, then serve the lamb individually, with enough sauce, figs and apricots to get the balance.<p>The thing I really love about the recipe is how the spicy heat from the harissa complements the sweetness of the apricots and figs. The lamb acts as a neutral balancer, but the texture is just incredible. It's an amazing modern and exotic take on a great classical dish. Please do try it if you have a slow cooker.<p>Protips for the not yet ramen profitable: Looking to do this on the cheap? Then bear these tips in mind.<p>1. Shanks are normally quite cheap, but you can get away with the cheapest possible cuts of lamb you can find. You can also use beef if that works for you. This dish was designed for low quality cuts - the key thing is giving it enough time. If you cook it for 12 hours on low and use a shank I pretty much guarantee that when you lift it up out of the crockpot by the bone the meat <i>will</i> fall off and back in. It's that tender.<p>2. Don't be afraid to use apricots or figs near their sell by date. If it's cheaper to get fresh or on the turn, just dry them out in the sun for about 6 hours beforehand. Apricots get squishy before going off, figs get sweaty. They're still good for this dish.<p>3. You can keep the dish in the cooker and reheat it the next day - you should get about 3-4 days worth of shank on your own. To reheat just give yourself an hour or two, alternatively top up the harissa, add another cinnamon stick, put it on low in the morning before work and come home to an even better tasting lamb shank in the evening. You can also pad it out with vegetables like potatoes cut into large chunks on days two and three. You can also top the sauce up with a little red wine if you want on days 2 and 3, but don't overdo it and chicken stop is cheaper.<p>4. If you're going to make this dish for someone you're having over for dinner (such as a significant other) then it's probably best to make the dish beforehand once. It is really really easy though, very hard to get wrong (given that you have about 8 hours to fix anything that pops up) and is pretty much a one pot recipe so there's less washing up. This is definitely a hacker and newb-cook friendly dish.<p>5. Most importantly if an ingredient costs a load then ditch it. Use dates instead of figs if they're cheaper, just use less of them because they're sweeter. Use the cheapest onions you can find, use dried herbs instead of fresh if you don't grow your own etc. - chilli paste will taste slightly different compared to harissa paste but if it's cheaper and cash is tight then go for it.<p>I hope you enjoy that recipe, if you don't mind this took a while, I'll do my roast lamb with slow-roasted dates in white wine and garlic.",1298503756

It takes 2.5 seconds to fall 100 feet. So Arthur, who was one ""level"" down, would have had 2.5x20 seconds to figure out what's going on... come up with a plan... go back to the floor below to retrieve the charges... get back  to the floor where the team is... get them wrapped up and moved to the elevator... set the charges... and finally detonate them. That took _way_ longer than 50 seconds.<p>Sadly, I actually did a little more research after the movie and found my estimate was even a little generous. The bridge the van was falling off was the Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge in LA.

In fact, I don't think we can have advances in language design without relaxing the constraint you're alluding to.<p>Consider an extreme scenario where I've designed a language where the following line of code does what you'd expect:<p><pre><code>    ask for an input, assume it is a number, calculate its factorial, and display it
</code></pre>
Notice that you have never seen this language before and you have no idea what's going on under the hood to make this happen. However, you know what the code is <i>expected</i> to accomplish.<p>I think that's a worthwhile tradeoff. It's what all of these languages are trying to do - to allow the programmer to write down their thoughts as close to human language as possible. You only need to care about how things work at the lower level of abstraction when the abstraction has a bug or needs changing. If I can work 80% of my time at the level of abstraction of the ""code sample"" above (diving into the nasty internals 20% of the time) I'd start using that language immediately.",1298502345

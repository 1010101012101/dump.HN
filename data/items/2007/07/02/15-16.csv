This community tends to reward quality responses, whereas larger communities tend to evolve to the point of rewarding asinine negativity.<p>\nThat said, most of the negative comments made by those on reddit about articles I have written tend to be fairly accurate...",1183390887

I get a couple of nights a week to work on my startup project, and it sucks:  a) it's not nearly enough time, b) I totally lose flow, c) I'm tired before I start, and so have really motivation trouble.<p>Many a-list bloggers say it's really not an ideal approach - and they're right.<p>That said, I have no choice.  I have a wife & 2 kids, and not that much money in the bank right now.  So my choices are either moonlighting or give up the startup dream, which I absolutely refuse to do.  (Which reminds me: all that stuff about the tech industry being a complete meritocracy, you can start a startup on no money, etc. - that's all just crap.  There's no meritocracy.  You can only launch a startup if you - or someone else (your daddy, etc.) has enough money to pay all your bills while you do it.  That rules out:  working class people, middle class people with kids, etc.)<p>Anyway, my goal is to work enough to just get something launched, and then hope it takes off from there enough to transition to it full time.  It's a long tough road, but I'm tough enough to stay with it.<p>Still, I would not recommend this route.",1183390206

32041,comment,31834,31834,0,0,iamwil,,,"This article got me thinking...how would I get to work with Richard Feynman?  Going to MIT or Caltech would help.  Not necessarily those actual places that matters, but being at a place that attracts passionate and smart like-minded individuals.  That way, you can learn from them and expose yourself to different ideas.  <p>The other point is probably to be working on an interesting problem.  Nothing swarms geeks like an interesting problem.  <p>As an aside, it's funny that Feynman didn't mind painting walls just because he was a Nobel winner.  When I make it, I wish to keep the same attitude.  Any help helps.<p>It's too bad that Thinking Machines didn't stay afloat.

Their market position makes true innovation difficult, though, and they might have to sacrifice the stability of the mid/mass-market, where they've had (albeit lukewarm) success, in order to gain competitive advantage against Google. <p>Has anyone heard about how well Caterina Fake is doing with the Brickyard initiative? Maybe more of the company's overall strategy should come out of that unit.<p>Overall, though, Yahoo needs a really solid breakthrough in ad-serving technology-- so much of their money comes from content/ad-serving partnerships with other properties, and a real ad-serving advantage will enable them to deliver a lot more value on those partnerships. YPN is a good start, but it only moves the ball forward a smidge.\n",1183388762

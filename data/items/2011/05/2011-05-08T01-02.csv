The truth is that it's a lot more complicated, there's a lot of laws governing newspaper behaviours while Google can get away with murder. Google have recently done a lot of very, very underhanded and nasty advertising in recent years in my opinion.<p>Their monopoly really stick in my craw.

I'm just reading up on that now and am appalled that if my co-founders (who are best friends with each other), elevan months from now, wanted to dismiss me and replace me with a good friend of theirs or family member, they would be legally allowed to send me on my way with 0% equity for all my hard work, ideas, and connections. How is this normal practice?<p>The core of this business model and much of its evolution came from my ideas and although I trust my partners, I can't take the risk of losing everything at their very whim. Is there anything I can do to protect myself going into this, so that I can at least insure some amount of guaranteed equity?<p>Thanks for any advice you can offer.<p>Best,<p>Jason",1304819287

2524993,comment,2524422,2524422,46,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Git features the ""rebase"" command which can be used to change the sequence of check-ins in the repository. Rebase can be used to ""clean up"" a complex sequence of check-ins to make their intent easier for others to understand. From another point of view, rebase can be used to ""rewrite history"" - to do what Winston Smith did for a living in Orwell's novel 1984.</i><p>This is FUD.  Git never erases history; it merely moves mutable <i>refs</i> around.  When you rebase a branch called ""master"", nothing is rewritten: a new immutable commit history is created, and the ref ""master"" is moved from pointing at the old history to pointing at the new history.  The old history still exists in all its glory at ""master@{0}"".  (And when you change that, it goes to master@{1}, and so on.)<p>If git didn't have the concept of refs, then this would never even worry anyone.  Once you have commit ab387df, it's refers to the same sequence of changes for all eternity.  What master points to may change out from under you, but the history never goes anywhere.<p>The only way to ""rewrite history"" is to delete every copy of the repository ever made, which is exactly how you would rewrite history with Fossil or Subversion or anything.<p>(And now, if I may, a digression.  I've noticed that the ""rewriting history"" aspect of Git makes for a good personality test.  It's strongly polarizing -- the people that think source control is designed to be documentation love it, and the people that think source control is an audit mechanism hate it.  Control freaks hate git, and long-haired hippies seem to love it.)",1304816407

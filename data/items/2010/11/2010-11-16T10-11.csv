I'm sure flicking through channels would be easy enough with some kind of motion commands, but navigating to specific channels, how would you do that? I guess you could have a specific gesture for each individual channel, but even then, it would me much easier to just say the name of a chennel. Another idea would be a specific gesture to go to the list of channels, which you could then scroll through and select, but this is still more work then voice commands.

1909713,comment,1909315,1909315,0,0,jbermudes,,,"So many times at college in computer science I heard the idea that math == computer science and that it is impossible to grok one but not the other.<p>I've heard the famous Dijkstra quote ""Computer Science is to computers as Astronomy is to telescopes"", but one aspect of computer science education strikes me as fundamentally different than math education: The technological revolution brought by the compiler. While it's true that a compiler can't tell you if your algorithm is correct and is thus useless for algorithm analysis (although there are other tools for that), its ability to check syntax, etc. makes it an invaluable tool for the beginning programmer who once he is comfortable with programming can use it as a tool to explore computer science. The compiler is like a computerized instructor giving feedback for elementary programming in the same way that a human instructor gives feedback to students for elementary math. Of course in advanced math the student must reason out complex proofs, but at the beginning stages of any algebra or calculus course there’s a lot of ""You must do X before Y"" and its that kind of basic rules that are analogous to programming language syntax and grammar.<p>The compiler in computer science education is different from a calculator or a system like matlab or even those online assessment tests like ""Webwork"" found in higher math education because those tools are only binary in their feedback: ""Either you're completely right or completely wrong, and I'm not going to tell you why you're wrong. Good luck!"" If you had worked the problem out on the board with an instructor hopefully they tell you “You were close, but you messed up here, you can’t take the square root of that without doing this other thing first” or ""you used the chain method incorrectly over here""<p>It is my goal to one day develop an open source ""math compiler"" that allows you to write out the steps of your problem line-by-line (either through pen input or some sort of math symbol input system) and let the compiler give you that sort of feedback that would otherwise take a dedicated tutor to give. I know that there’s a million ways to solve a given math problem, but math textbooks usually teach things in certain orders, so you more or less know what the student will know at that point in the semester, and if someone is already thinking beyond the material then they don’t need this helper at this point anyway.<p>It’s a crazy idea, but it is my hope that in the years to come we will see technology not necessarily replace human educators, but rather supplement them, allowing feedback that would normally consume all of one instructor’s time and being able to simultaneously provide that to an entire classroom.",1289904507

1909701,comment,1909315,1909641,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sure you can, it's been done, it's not rocket science.<p>The problem with today's school system in America (and likely elsewhere throughout the industrialized world) is that it's very much aimed at teaching the wrong people the wrong things in the wrong way (and that's when teaching doesn't take a back seat to day-care). The main goal is for everyone to memorize as much of a broad swath of ""material"" as possible, it's very much a teaching-to-the-test least-effort system. It's not geared toward maximizing each individual student's learning. Nor is it geared toward teaching competency and fully mastering basic yet key skills. Nor is it geared toward teaching useful skills that are key building blocks in the workplace, as a member of society, and as a functioning citizen of a democratic republic.<p>The steps necessary to improve this situation are fairly straightforward. As a start, reduce class sizes and hire better teachers, which is possible without increasing per-student expenditures provided the bloat in non-teaching staff and unnecessary expenditures is cut back (per-student spending has more than doubled in the last 3 decades, adjusted for inflation, the money has not gone to improving education, it has been frittered away). End the farce of overstuffed curricula. There is a monomania about covering as much material as possible, so long as students can retain enough to pass a test, but students don't retain much of the material and when the fundamentals are neglected they miss out on that too. Take the basics back to basics, emphasize the fundamentals (reading, writing, mathematics, fundamental science), learning them, knowing them, mastering them. Continue to refresh and test students on those fundamentals throughout their <i>entire</i> K-12 educations. And provide enough funding to allow gifted students to work at a faster pace, either within existing classes or in classes of their own.<p>I could go on, but that's a good start. Unfortunately, the biggest impediments aren't knowing how to improve, it's all of the interests and bureaucracy protecting the status quo.",1289904039

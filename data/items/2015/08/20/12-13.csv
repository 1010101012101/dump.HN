But for me this is not the norm, most days are a mix of too hard and too easy, so motivation is sometimes a struggle and/or I&#x27;m exhausted and glad if I can go home and recharge for the next day. Even if work is good and fun, sometimes I&#x27;m just so much more exited about something not work related (at home, with friends, cool new tech), that I&#x27;m also eager to leave or am just distracted while at work.<p>For me it is &quot;hard&quot; to simply give 100% with no distractions to my fullest potential for 8 hours. I can&#x27;t even do that for 8 hours most days, so why expect me to do it for 12 or even longer, there would quickly be a negative ROI like the article suggest. I think most people experience work most of the time more or less like that.<p>On the other hand on days where everything is just right (also on the weekend with non work related tasks I&#x27;m exited about) and I&#x27;m in the flow, hours do not matter much, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I get a positive return from more hours. At least in the short term, I never had the honour to have such a perfect job to experience that daily for months to know about the long term.<p>That is to say that I could see that for somebody a) with a different personality to shut out distractions, has naturally better motivation or more energy etc or b) with a &quot;perfect&quot; job, it could be or at least feel different. It might be/feel so easy to work fully concentrated for 8 or more hours that &quot;working hard&quot; has to be something even more for them.",1440075264

Yes it can save bandwidth but it actually creates an awful user experience.<p>If you have a bunch of images you don&#x27;t want to wait to load them until in view especially on a slow connection. If you lazy load the images then that means every time the user scrolls they have to wait for an image. No one is going to wait for your image to load, so they will scroll on. You then cause a bottleneck in your javascript because the user is scrolling and you are using JS to download images which is not optimal.<p>The experience you want is to load the first image and then load then next image before the user gets to it so that it is ready when the user scrolls. Our browsers do a great job of this already.  Don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel.  Our browsers have been optimized to download images the right way.

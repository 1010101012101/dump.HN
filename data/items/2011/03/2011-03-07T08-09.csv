A very simple PHP script will suffice, and for most hosting providers you'll spend less time learning PHP and getting a page up than you will just working out how to install Django and deploy it behind Apache.  That stuff is well worth doing when you have a real site to put up, but not for a single page with one form.<p>* I don't think TC will be interested in featuring a marketing page with no product behind it.<p>* As naithemilkman asked, how big is your group?  If there are more than two of you and you're looking for a technical cofounder to do all the implementation, your idea better involve a lot of non-technical work.  Otherwise, frankly, what are you all going to bring to the table?<p>I do think learning Django is a great idea in general, and it will also give you independence from having to persuade a technical person to join you and work on your project.  I like Django because Python is a very easy language for beginning programmers, and there's a lot of reusable Django code out there.  The docs and community are pretty solid, too.  (If you do start learning Django I'd suggest reading the 1.3 docs, since 1.3 is coming out in a few days.)  The other thing that might make sense is to have one or two people focus on Python and back-end Django (views, models/ORM, etc.) and one focus on learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Django templates (front-end stuff), if all of you are serious about making a technical contribution.",1299488105

I think perhaps the article (quite excellent otherwise) underplays and maybe misunderstands slightly the way that kind of autistic outlook can alter intimacy. That sort of situation he describes, where you find someone you think you're intimate with and it turns out it's all a lie -- that happens a lot if you're unable to correctly interpret the way people behave. So early ""close friends"" aren't friends at all, and you never let later friends get close because you can't trust them. At least that's how it is with me, and a lot of people with Aspergers have it <i>much</i> worse. Then again, a lot of people in the hacker community have it much better. But if the hacker community is correctly characterized as autistic... a lack of close friends relative to ""normal"" people wouldn't surprise me, both early and later in life.",1299488035

</code></pre>
Unless you have a particular reason to believe that GUI is the end of evolution, then there's room for massive change.<p>Circumstances suggest that wimp is not the last word on user interfaces. Some factors to think about:<p>* The GUI has grown during an era of groups fighting to establish platforms, when there were constant newcomers to the scene which caused a large emphasis on creating systems that are as newcomer-friendly as possible. Those circumstances will change.<p>* As the scale of data increases, user interface needs change. Consider the progression from flat file structure, to directories on a single machine to searching through large datasets, and the different tooling we use. I deal with large numbers of small files, and have built custom tools to allow myself not to drown in scale. GUI tools and CLI directory systems are inadequate.<p>* A lot of GUI has been driven by the need to make glossy things that sell, rather than things that are useful. Look at changes to Windows since XP. As free software eats away at territory that is currently commercially viable, this will change. We won't have companies pushing gaudy bells and whistles that have shifted platforms over the last fifteen years. Stability increases in value.<p>* Plenty of power users have never been happy with the WIMP approach, and consider it a leap backwards from the CLI. 1980s word processing users, unix users, people who knew menu-driven mainframe systems before being ""upgraded"" to less-useful GUI replacements. There's strong interface loyalty to the Bloomberg interface from people who have also dealt with GUI and CLI tools, despite significant problems in that system.<p>It's unusual to know about groundbreaking things before they happen. I expect our grandchildren will look back at screenshots of today's candy interfaces and ask how we took it seriously.",1299487862

I mean, those are dedicated devices, tailored for just that use. They were created for that purpose.

Should I persist and submit the app under the ""shared"" name? (Wouldn't a submission like this be rejected straight away?)
* 2. Should I change my app's name subtlety to differentiate my product? (e.g. something like ""black-jack.com's black-jack"" or ""iBlack-Jack"" instead of just ""black-jack"" which is already taken)
* 3. Should I just cut my losses with the app store and concentrate on the Android Market?<p>Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.<p>Cheers,

2296436,comment,2295634,2295795,0,0,aaronwall,,,"I do leave wiggle room in the words because I often analyze how systems are changing. Such analysis is based on hunches and presumption and experiences that can't always fully be revealed publicly without leading people astray or adding unnecessary risk.<p>If I am too ridged in how I write & then Google changes their approach in a slightly different way, then I look like the bad guy for not being 100% right 100% of the time.<p>Predicting the future is hard.<p>And since some people read your writing months or years after you type something, being too rigid in a changing ecosystem is going to lead some folks astray. This is only compounded by the verticalization of search, SEO strategies being different in different regions of the world, SEO strategies having different levels of risks vs reward for different types of organizations, etc.<p>Also in some cases Google has been known to have a vindictive side, which throws other presumptions out the window. You learn a new part of ""the algorithm"" when you are put up to vote for public lynching on a Google engineer's blog. :D<p>That said, they typically are pretty fair. Though there are some absurd exceptions. ;)<p>I am more for promoting questioning authority & encouraging testing than a static paint-by-number approach. That can make it seem like the writer is being obtuse or translucent, but that is far better than saying ""always do X"" and then have someone get utterly destroyed for following the tip.<p>Also we do run a number of sites. And our approach is based on ""do what works."" I may criticize Google's approach to something while testing how well it works. I don't control their ecoysystem, but I do monitor how it works and run many tests in parallel.<p>For the record with eHow, I don't mind them existing and am totally cool with Google being fine with them. What I do think is laughable though is the following combination:<p>- Google claiming they can't judge content quality when they frequently judge the intent of links (with far less information available)<p>- Google writing an algorithm to catch content farms which torches 10's of thousands of smaller websites while somehow missing eHow<p>- Google torching some people for using expired domains, but not giving a crap if eHow buys a registrar and does it in bulk (which is yet another side of ""the algorithm"" most people do not understand)<p>Ultimately I am fine with search engines doing whatever they feel they should. All I ask is for consistency in enforcement & approach. If they assume you are guilty & should be destroyed for doing x, then they shouldn't preach their moral superiority when they fund someone doing 100x or 1000x worse than what was worth torching you over.<p>I haven't had any sites fully torched in quite a long time, but I can tell you that the site that was penalized to the most extreme level was not doing anywhere near the same level of shady crap that eHow was doing recently. It was not even in the same league or solar system! But I know if I followed eHow's lead on some of that stuff I would get torched.",1299484957

I doubt many would discern the irony in it.<p>One thing that's relevant: very few ""hackers"" obtain really good, close friends early in life.  I've been lucky to have found a few very, very good friendships in middle and high school, and very few since.  It continually amazes me how shallow and disconnected most people remain for most of their lives -- I find myself coming back to old friendships constantly (in terms of thinking about how we relate to each other).  For example, playing in a band in high school was educational.  Being so intimate (in certain ways) with my friends to a point where we could play musically and make mistakes and recover through mere eye contact was quite an experience.<p>It's something that's difficult to replicate, especially in a field that's so disconnected from human contact.

The options currently out there are all pricey (for the 'starving artist' types that musicians tend to be anyway), bloated (the latest Guitar Pro has Effects Pedals for crying out loud), and just expect musicians to instinctively know what to do when given nearly half a screenful of buttons. Just the other day I noticed a Sibelius manual at my local bookstore that was the size of a phone book! If you're a songwriter, all you want to do is basically get to the point where you could record a demo of your stuff; the last thing you're gonna want to do, is waste your time going through a huge tome just to write your stuff down.<p>I'm actually working on a startup that's looking to solve this problem, and we're fully confident that good, affordable, and simple yet well-thought-out music notation software is something that musicians everywhere are going to have a huge sigh of relief over.

My bad that I unknowingly assumed that other readers believe in the same assumptions.<p>Hope this will help the discussion.<p>From a web application perspective, my assumptions are<p>a) continuous deployment/integration means able to (as much as possible) automate the process of deployment of the code on a server preferably one where the configuration is identical to the production server. regardless how much the code is completed.<p>b) continuous deployment/integration means able to (as much as possible) automate the process of testing the deployed code against unit tests or functional tests therefore allowing developers to add new features or re-factor existing code without fear of integration risks.<p>Again, I would like to seek help to automate (as much as possible) the process of deployment.<p>I already have Capistrano working but to a production environment.<p>I am not looking to hire from HN readers, though I do not rule that out. at the very least point me to good places to look for such people.<p>Like a stranger in another country, I need directions. Either take me where I want to go, or tell me where I can ask for better directions.<p>I hope that analogy works to express what I am asking for.<p>Thank you very much to all feedback so far.",1299484895

Each one is authentic, but they're authentic to the specific context that you are in.<p>For example, I rarely swear at work - I have to be very frustrated or angry to do it there.  A few minor words may slip out from time to time when I'm talking to family, but again, they don't hear it from me very often.  On the other hand, with some of my friends I swear all the time.<p>In real life you can usually understand the context you are in pretty easily.  Online it also used to be pretty simple - you would have one or more handles that you would use on different sites, and you generally acted appropriate to the image you presented using that handle.  But now Facebook wants to combine all of that.  They can present it as simplifying things for you - after all, you no longer have to manage all these different accounts right?  But it also means that no matter where you are, you have to decide which ""you"" to present.<p>This is going to cause problems.  --Those of us who understand the consequences are likely to either avoid sites that force you to authenticate through Facebook (this is my option), or start treating Facebook like Linkedin and do your best to prevent anything that may present you in an unflattering light to a potential employer.

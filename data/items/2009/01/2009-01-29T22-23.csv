457299,story,,,11,12,ssanders82,"Ask HN: Fuzzy Logic SQL select framework",,"Hi, I've recently been reading up on fuzzy logic. The crux of it seems to be allowing members to have partial inclusion in a set, instead of our current set paradigm of ""it's in or it's out. As an example, consider the set ""Long Rivers"". The Amazon would have a 1.0 membership in this set whereas the Mississippi might have - let's say - 0.8 membership, the Ohio River 0.5, and the stream in your backyard would be 0. This number quantifies how much the item belongs in the set.<p>An analogous example would be our everyday sql selects. Let's say a company is searching for young employees with great sales records, to consider for promotions. ""SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Age<30 and Sales>100000 ORDER BY Sales desc,Age asc"". This statement will miss the 21 year-old with $90,000 in sales and the 31 year-old with $500,000, although those people may be bright young stars as well. Widening the search parameters waters down the results and the black & white nature of it will always miss those on the cusp.<p>What the company <i>actually</i> wants is to do a sql statement ""SELECT young employees with great sales records"".<p>One solution would be fuzzy logic. They want employees that fall into two sets - 1.) young and 2.) good sales. The fuzzy solution would say, ok, every employee selling over $100,000 per year is a member of the Good Sales set with a membership value of 1.0. Over $90,000 is 0.8. $75,000 is 0.6.<p>Also, anyone less than 30 years old is a member of the Young Employee set with membership 1.0. 31 years old is 0.8. 35 is 0.5.<p>Once you define those parameters, by definition the membership of an employee in the two sets is the lowest membership he has in either set. Our precocious 21 year-old would be 0.8 (he has 1.0 in Young, and 0.8 in Good Sales) and our older but productive 31 year-old would also be 0.8 (0.8 Young and 1.0 Good Sales).<p>Our new query is something like ""SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Membership_YoungAndGoodSales>0 ORDER BY Membership_YoungAndGoodSales DESC, Sales DESC, Age ASC"". This first returns all employees with perfect matches (1.0 membership in both sets) but scales down to include partial matches as well that might warrant a further look, as long as they have a non-zero membership in both sets.<p>I'm also testing this now with NBA games - instead of selecting teams that have scored 110 points per game AND have held opponents to 90 points per game AND (etc.), I just want to ""SELECT high-scoring teams with good defense AND (etc.)""<p>Anyway, I was just curious if there was any existing db framework or code to deal with this. The major challenge seems to be coming up with the partial membership weights (e.g. a 31 year-old is 0.8 Young...why not 0.7 or 0.9?)<p>I was thinking that it would be possible to write a db selection framework that works with existing sql filter statements without modification - it could pre-process it and return exact matches first, then partials (for fields where it has membership information), ordering by the membership weight DESC. Anyway, feedback?",1233269580

No. I said that I don't like casual sex. Madonna/whore implies that a woman who has <i>any</i> sex (or any sex with a man who's not her husband) is a whore. I don't think that's remotely true, and that I never said. It would be hypocritical. I'm not a virgin, but I've only had sex in the context of a committed, loving relationship, and I would be extremely suspicious of a woman who didn't share those values.<p>A whore or slut is a person who has sex with bad or immoral motivations. There's nothing wrong with a person (male or female) enjoying sex.<p>B. I implied that <i>people</i> (not just women) who <i>enjoy</i> casual sex are playing out anachronistic ""alpha male"" scripts, and that people with those tendencies tend to be psychopathic.<p>Also, note that I used the term ""alpha <i>male</i>"" in reference to the clinical disorder of psychopathy, implying even more strongly that men who involve themselves in casual sex are disordered. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=456289"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=456289</a> There are, in fact, more men who are psychopaths than women.<p>C.

I made an effort not to gender them. You did.<p>E. I did <i>NOT</i> say that. As per C, that was another poster. I don't conflate casual sex with feminism, and I would <i>NEVER</i> disparage feminism in such a way as to associate it with immoral behavior or to suggest that it was ""engineered by evil men"". <i>Sex and the City</i> is not feminist. It's entertainment, and shitty (arguably misogynist) entertainment at that. I <i>am</i> quite feminist, but I happen to believe that casual sex is radically anti-feminist.",1233269184

You can't use the argument of someone having it worse as a justification for not allowing people to be scared and/or unhappy. I agree that Arrington has gone overboard, but that's neither here nor there.<p>If you buy into his argument, then none of us have any reason to be unhappy. The teachers who get abused by their students and women who get stalked have no reason to be unhappy because there are people who can't put food on their table, so they are lucky, right? And the people who can't put food onto their tables can't be unhappy because they're not within minutes of losing their life to cancer, right? And the people with cancer? Well, they're not dead so they shouldn't be crybabies either.  It's turtles all the way down.<p>His post is nothing more than a way to generate traffic. How can I be sure? Because he put this near the top of his rant: ""Mike, I don't know if you realize, but a lot of people's jobs aren't fun at all.

For my business, I list the phone number on the ""contact us"" page and I've scored countless sales simply because someone was there to answer the phone (the phone number is just my cell phone, no real need for a toll-free number these days - everyone gets free long distance).<p>Historically, I've been a terrible customer service person (when I worked as an usher for a movie theater I hated customers), yet when it's your own product, and it's something you're <i>excited</i> about and something in which you truly believe, it really shows through in voice communication.<p>Those customers that get the rapid phone support are frequent sources of referrals, especially the repeat callers.<p>That said, I've been in business now for 2.5 years, have always had the phone number on the site, and have had more than 3,000 customers with a few hundred thousand users, yet I probably average maybe 30 minutes on the phone per day,  sometimes more, sometimes not a single call for a few days.  Most users use the contact form or the forums.  I'm still honestly surprised I don't get many calls.  As a one man shop, I was expecting to spend a lot of time on the phone, and I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong.  I was originally hesitant to post the phone number, but it becomes a very helpful tool, in my opinion.<p>But like some other users have mentioned, the phone number helps users be reassured they can get instant support if it's needed.   And like the article says, you can always let it go to voice mail if you're too busy.<p>Overall, great advice, imo.<p>(I know this is structured poorly as a sort of stream of consciousness, and for that I apologize).",1233266685

Virtually everything else I learned ""on the job"" (i.e., in grad school, doing research).<p>Oddly enough, I recently found myself using some tricks I picked up from a machine learning class for something completely different (the philosophical kind of quantum mechanics).",1203641746

Additionally, in a business you are looking ideally for individuals who complement yourself in skills (i.e. one business person, one technology person).<p>What is wrong with 1 non-programmer + 1 hacker sharing equity equally? I realize product development is paramount. I do not expect to be twiddling my thumbs while my partner hacks away. As a user of the internet and sites like the one I would like to build, I have many ideas concrete ideas about features/functionality I would like on the site and would hope to function as a team in developing the product.<p>Beyond that, down the road much of the focus would be on user acquisition strategies (for a user generated content site such as the one I would like to do).

If everyone in the world had a billion dollars then a billion dollars would be relatively worthless.<p>The study should have been phrased: ""If you could have only $1,000 worth of stuff but it was 100 times more stuff than everyone else, or $1,000,000 worth of stuff but it was 1000 times less than everyone else, which would you choose?""<p>I think the majority of people would choose to have $1,000,000 worth of stuff, even if it's the least, which translates to ""I would rather be considered 'poor' in a thriving society than be considered 'rich' in an impoverished society.""",1203641323

120909,comment,120843,120873,0,0,sarosh,,,"I respectfully disagree with edw519.
While your assessment that you are indeed not a ""programmer"" may be technically accurate, but, if this is you:<p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/B06/B99"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/B06/B99</a><p>then I think you sufficiently qualify under a very broad definition of a hacker, or, alternatively, you are quite technical yourself. While you may currently feel you need a co-founder for your project who is a ""programmer"", you should not sell yourself short.<p>One thing you should strongly consider is just plunging in and trying to code for yourself. Take a look at this article  regarding the founder of Plentyoffish.com. Mssr. Frind built the site while learning to program. See, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13digi.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=plenty+of+fish&oref=slogin&oref=slogin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13digi.html?_r=2&...</a><p>So one approach would be to learn to program while you put the site together. While this may be rough in the beginning and ultimately result in total failure, you will at least (a) know more about what goes into making a web app (generally) and (b) when you seek a technical co-founder you can be much more precise and clear about what you need.<p>As for languages, Ruby on Rails or Python would both be great. But, just for fun, take a look at Arc

Sometime ago I had to render some maps with Mapnik (<a href=""http://mapnik.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mapnik.org</a>) which is driven by Python scripts. I didn't know any Python, so I just pasted an example from the 'net and started reworking it to suit my needs, experimenting and reading docs whenever I got stumped. Quickly picked up enough Python to write my own scripts, solve other tasks. For me it's the only way to learn.",1203641059

120905,comment,120593,120593,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"One wonders whether the stable number of Facebook users is approximately equal to the number of high school and college students.<p>The hypothesis that high schoolers with Facebook profiles will continue to use them throughout life is only now being put to the test. And here's the thing: In high school, many people really care to know exactly what each of their classmates is doing and who they are dating. Sometimes that continues through college. But eventually people grow older, and they escape the social fishtank that is school, and they go out into the world... and, what do you know, eventually you stop hanging around with all of your school friends. You make a big show of keeping up with all of them for a while... but eventually it tapers down to sending Christmas cards now and then. You visit every few years. And you certainly don't visit them all.<p>I'm not saying that you'll ever stop using social networks. But there are a lot of social networks now. They're not that hard to develop, and they're just going to keep getting easier. And the result may well be that different people will gravitate to different ones as they go through life.<p>Facebook's counterargument is that they are going to be the generic platform on which all future special-purpose social nets will be based. But Facebook wasn't designed as a generic platform. It was designed as a social network for college students. And I'm not sure that opening the user base and tacking on a thousand third-party apps has really changed that. It's hard to take a tool that was carefully optimized for one task and repurpose it for N other tasks... especially when there are a thousand competitors with similar technology, and the lock-in isn't that strong.",1203640856

9252356,comment,9251396,9252078,0,0,_ak,,,"I don&#x27;t think you understand how parliamentary elections worked and how governments were formed in the Weimar Republic.<p>A critical amount of people voted for the candidates of the NSDAP (33.1% of all votes, the relative majority of the last 1932 election), who in turn formed a coalition, with Hitler als Chancellor. Formally, the president appoints the government and the chancellor, and the party resp. coalition of parties with an absolute majority of seats in parliament is who is normally appointed (and I think there is a certain legal obligation, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure on that).<p>The current German political system is in fact very similar to the one of the Weimar Republic (with details like certain thresholds to prevent dozens of tiny parties). Claiming Hitler was never elected is like claiming Angela Merkel was never elected.",1427133592

The web is a deployment platform. Developers want to write the least amount of code to be able to support the most users possible. That was supposed to be Java, but it didn&#x27;t work out that way. Deployment is still a platform-specific issue in Java, because users--for whatever reason--hate WebStart and its ilk. Add to that the fact that smartphones just plain don&#x27;t support Java in <i>that</i> way and suddenly the browser makes for the only pragmatic cross-platform toolkit for building applications.<p>Yeah, JS sucks.

I&#x27;m co-chairing it this year.<p>USENIX WOOT is the academic equivalent of Black Hat or CanSec. It&#x27;s a software security conference with a special focus on &quot;offensive&quot; security: vulnerability research, exploit development, and technology failures that lead to those things.<p>If you were going to summarize the point of WOOT in one sentence: it&#x27;s an effort to cross-pollinate academic research with industry research that works by getting the kind of work that would normally be submitted to Black Hat, CanSec, Defcon, RECON, and ShmooCon and also getting it into the academic cite record.<p>I&#x27;m trying to get WOOT to do a better job of engaging the open source and startup communities.<p>WOOT does a pretty good job of getting contributions from the &quot;software security industry&quot; (consultancies, security product companies, security research labs). But more and more interesting and relevant work is being done in the context of small projects. If you&#x27;ve built, say, a website that processes financial transactions, and had to build up countermeasures for fraud that&#x27;s work that&#x27;s relevant to WOOT, and WOOT is interested in publishing it. If you&#x27;ve build a NoSQL database and had to come up with a threat model to deal with new kinds of injection attacks, or to deal with malicious cluster nodes: totally WOOT-worthy. As long as the work focuses on the &quot;attacker&quot; side of the security problem, it&#x27;s relevant to us.<p>You don&#x27;t need to write a paper to submit! We&#x27;re interested in outlines and sketches of work, and will help you turn that work into a paper. You don&#x27;t have to write speculatively for us.<p>WOOT is relatively high profile. An accepted WOOT paper is a meaningful contribution to the academic literature. We&#x27;d like to see more of it come from the kinds of people who contribute to HN.<p>The proceedings from the previous 8 years of WOOT are available online. Check out last year&#x27;s, which includes (for instance) some pretty great work from Dan Boneh, Grant Ho, Niels Provos and Lucas Ballard:<p><a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot14/workshop-program"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot14/workshop-program</a><p>Happy to answer questions!",1427133371

It seems like every despotic nation needs at least some kind of elections. Even in totally authoritarian countries, like say, Saddam&#x27;s Iraq or North Korea, elections are held even if the leader always wins in a landslide and it&#x27;s clear to any outside observer that the results are pre-determined.<p>200 years ago, there was no need for such things. Monarchy was considered a perfectly legitimate form of government. Voting was considered dangerous, and people often argued that democracy would be &quot;mob rule&quot; or &quot;tyranny of the masses&quot;. Systems like the electoral college (and representative democracy) were created to put a check on such fears.<p>Even without Monarchy, &quot;enlightened despotism&quot; was advanced by many in the 19th century. Consider the words of (19th century general) Santa Anna: &quot;[The Mexican people] do not know what [liberty] is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of a Catholic clergy, a despotism is the proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.&quot;<p>But at some point along the way, it became clear that to have any legitimacy, you have to have some kind of election.

Also, since there&#x27;s no parallelism, the consequences of having side effects in monadic compositions (promises) are not as bad as in environments that do support parallelism.

I count a significant number of these as being among the finest SF I&#x27;ve yet come across. Many envelope the reader in an air of melancholy; very Bradburyesque.<p>Here&#x27;s a description of one of the notable authors, from &quot;World&#x27;s Spring&quot;, edited by Vladimir Gakov:<p><i>&quot;Genrikh Altov is one of the most interesting portraits in the gallery of Soviet science fiction writers. An engineer and inventor who holds several dozen patents; the creator of a new science on which special courses are now being given in educational institutions in the USSR, &#x27;The Theory of Invention,&#x27; and the author of several monographs in this field; an SF fan and the author of the unparalleled (I vote for a special Hugo Award!) Altov&#x27;s Register - a catalog of themes, plots, hypotheses, ideas, situations, etc., containing hundreds of thousands of processed bits of information. (The dream of the SF writer: an idea comes to you, so you check it out in the Register to see if it has been used before; if the idea has been &#x27;copyrighted&#x27; by another writer, it&#x27;s no great problem, because the Register contains open cells, the descriptions of still-unused sf ideas and situations.) A theoretician of the sf genre; the author of profound articles tracing the sf predictions of Wells, Verne, Alexander Beliaev... A teacher at a scientific research institute teaching young inventors to develop their imaginations, their ability not to be afraid of &#x27;crazy&#x27; ideas...&quot;</i><p>There&#x27;s also a stunning novel in the series: &quot;Self Discovery&quot;, by Vladimir Savchenko. It has a completely convincing description of a biological computer AI. And then, this: <i>&quot;I would like to study the question of the untapped resources of man&#x27;s organism. For example, the obsolescent functions, like our common ancestor&#x27;s ability to leap from tree to tree or to sleep in the branches. Now that is no longer necessary, but the cells are still there. Or take the &#x27;goosebump&#x27; phenomenon - it happens on skin that has almost no hair now. It is created by a vast nervous network. Perhaps these old reflexes can be restructured, re-programmed to meet new needs?&quot;</i>  (In Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s words: <i>&quot;What an astonishing, what an exciting concept!&quot;</i>)<p>Best of all, that book is freely available online: <a href=""http://www.lib.ru/RUFANT/SAWCHENKO/savchenko_selfdiscovery_ok-engl.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lib.ru/RUFANT/SAWCHENKO/savchenko_selfdiscovery_o...</a>",1427133065

I think most developers do indeed talk to their users, and they rather enjoy doing it, too. I&#x27;ve once worked in a place where developers are more detached from users, but that was an exception, not a norm.<p>There&#x27;s also a difference between the opinion of one user vs the collective opinions of users as a whole. In most software these are conflicting goals. For example, iOS can&#x27;t just add random features willy-nilly to satisfy an individual&#x27;s feedback. So the product management needs to come in between developers and users to aggregate user demands. You&#x27;ll have to make everyone a little bit unhappy to make users collectively happier. One of the reasons I like extensible software is that those two goals are no longer conflicting.

(But the liberal machine is much better oiled and more generally competent, moaning about Fox News notwithstanding.) It&#x27;s hard to see propaganda that you currently agree with. (I do not exclude myself from that general statement, it&#x27;s just that what I find harder to see is quite different than what the general US news is currently propagating.)<p>But I&#x27;d also observe that even standing outside the mainstream of US political propaganda, I&#x27;m not convinced there&#x27;s necessarily a cabal of insiders sitting around in their smoke filled rooms figuring out how to &quot;keep the masses in line&quot;. I think instead you&#x27;ve got people figuring out how to push their agendas, often in groups, and through a process of natural selection on the agendas in question you end up with agendas that tend to satisfy people to some extent and &quot;keep them in line&quot;. You need not &quot;conspire&quot; to push fairly popular ideologies on people, you need only let the adherents of those ideologies do the things they naturally will do anyhow.<p>Edit: Look, downvoters, you might not like to hear it, but the US propaganda machine is liberal, or at least, Democratic (if you are more liberal than the Democrats and consider them &quot;conservative&quot;). Look at the political affiliations of the media, Hollywood, the bureaucratic apparatus, the University and academic system, and to believe that the propaganda system <i>isn&#x27;t</i> Democratic is to believe that all of these things are peopled by 90%+ Democrats yet somehow transcend their political orientation to push... what, exactly? It&#x27;s not even close... it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s 60-40, it&#x27;s 90%+ plus on every survey ever taken of those groups in recent times. Note my claim here is an <i>objectively verifiable fact</i>, not merely an abstract partisan snipe job. Ask yourself, <i>what else would they be pushing</i>?<p>If you don&#x27;t see this, well... it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re not seeing the Democratic propaganda <i>as</i> propaganda, leaving you seeing only what gets through that isn&#x27;t.<p>Further edit: Would someone care to post and explain the social mechanisms whereby the media et al is populated by Democrats yet is pushing some other form of propaganda on us all the time?

The special &quot;linear&quot; says that given two inputs x and y to a function f, f is linear if f(x + y) = f(x) ⊕ f(y) for two operations +, ⊕. The general &quot;linear&quot; says that f(x + δx) = f(x) ⊕ δf(x, δx) for some small perturbations δx in the vicinity of x.<p>If x is a bit-vector then this can be as simple as saying &quot;flip one bit of the input and here&#x27;s how to predict which output bits get flipped.&quot; When you&#x27;re building a hash function in cryptography, you try to push the algorithm towards a non-answer here: about half the bits should get flipped, and you shouldn&#x27;t be able to predict which they are. But of course there&#x27;s a security vulnerability even if + and ⊕ are not XORs.<p>Resisting &quot;adversarial perturbation&quot; in this context means basically that neural nets need to behave a bit more like hash functions, otherwise they will confuse the heck out of us. The problem is that if you just took the core lesson of hash functions -- create some sort of &quot;round function&quot; `r` so that the result is r(r(r(...r(x, 1)..., n - 2), n - 1), n) -- seems like it&#x27;d be really hard to invent learning algorithms to tune.",1427131786

If you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t do that, then you&#x27;ll never ever succeed in this community and this profession/hobby, because constantly asking questions and answer them yourself is a fundamental skill.<p>Linking to an essay like esr&#x27;s might be off-putting to women, no-binary and transgender developers, but it&#x27;s also off-putting to cisgender developers. It&#x27;s off-putting to any one who has grown accustomed to letting others do the work for them and who haven&#x27;t developed a thick enough skin to accept a FAQ as an indirect response to their request for help. Lots of things about our community are off-putting to people regardless of gender identity or orientation. I myself am pansexual, identify as agender, but come across as cisgender (mainly because I choose my clothing based on comfort, fit and simplicity (I pretty much have all the same clothes and only need to make a determination on the color, since varying color is sufficient to eliminate the judgement that I wear the same clothes everyday)).<p>If the aspects of our community that Meredith describes in her essay is off-putting to some, that&#x27;s a good thing in my opinion because I don&#x27;t want a culture in tech that is so accommodating that it evolves into including so much of the rest of society that it develops into having a notion of intersectionality that no longer accommodates weirdos. I have on more than one occasion seen very capable engineers rejected as a candidate because one or more people interpreted their aspie behaviors and mannerisms as &quot;creepy&quot;. For example, being aware and accommodating of the mind-blindness off others is as important as being aware and accommodating of the gender and gender identities of others.<p>My personal experience has been that identity politics drives people apart. It used to be that when I came across someone of a different gender or gender identity as my own, I paid it no attention. What mattered was that we all had engineering and programming things to nerd out over. Now I don&#x27;t like going to engineering conferences anymore because the environment of gender politics is palpable. Instead I&#x27;ve directed more energy and time to IRC and Github where people are focused on more interesting things like the qualities of someone&#x27;s contributions (code and ideas) and not their identity. If there is no culture of constructivism and proofs, it&#x27;s probably not a forum I have interest in. Most conferences no longer represent a culture of constructivism and proofs. Only conferences like StrangeLoop, RacketCon, ErlangFactory, etc. interest me these days. Since they don&#x27;t represent language communities that are also an active job market (ruby, python, javascript, go, php, java), they don&#x27;t suffer nearly as much from identity politics overshadowing the computer science.",1427131446

Normally this is a problem, but perhaps they are using this drag to adjust the orbit.  I&#x27;m not talking plane change.  I mean controlling the amount of drag to adjust orbital speed/altitude/period.<p>Even with all their extra fuel, spy sats do not make plane changes.  A significant change would require hundreds of m/s and they have, at best, 1000m/s for their lifetime.  (Xenon is power-hungry/tricky/slow and therefore not suitable for quick plane changes).  These are multi-billion dollar assets with lifetimes measured in decades.  You aren&#x27;t going to spend 100m/s and shorten the lifetime of the asset by years, effectively spending a billion or more, on a plane change.<p>What they might do is adjust the timing of flyovers by controlled changes to orbital periods.  Rotating solar panels, a significant source of drag and reflection, could give some control.  Such a maneuver would probably be done at the lowest point in the orbit (highest drag) and could explain the quick and apparently random change in reflectivity.<p>The test for my theory: Does this disappearing trick happen more often at the low point of the orbit?

People respond in this manner when they <i>feel</i> like they have some sort of position they have personally gained through their own work that is now being threatened. The arguments often only hide an insecurity that the methods the &quot;traditionalist&quot; used to gain their position are dying out, that a new breed is forming, using new techniques that they don&#x27;t understand, but that they inherently recognize have the potential to be universally (or near-enough) superior, if given the time to be developed. Thus the need for the immediate, preemptive attack: to cut out the nascent ideology before it has a chance to establish roots.<p>I think the anti-intellectual aspersions cast towards computer science students is a good indicator of this. The techniques he holds dear are only possible because of computer science. Computer Science is a field of applied mathematics that some people dream will one day be treated like a field of theoretical mathematics, to gain standing and respect in the world of mathematics that traditionally looks down upon the applied fields like CS, statistics, cryptography, etc., in much the same way that &quot;aht&quot; artists look down on illustrators. I think he writes off an entire field of study just because occasionally, specific people--caught in this cultural divide between applied and theoretical mathematics--write some shitty code.<p>Let&#x27;s see him come up with IEEE floats on his own. Let&#x27;s see him conceive of 2&#x27;s compliment signed integers on his own. Let&#x27;s see him come up with an assembler on his own. Without prior exposure to the concept.[1] You don&#x27;t get Dijkstra&#x27;s path finding algorithm with an ivory-tower attitude that doesn&#x27;t care about the practicalities of implementation.<p>It&#x27;s not like people are or were getting paid to do this. People did it for fun. If you don&#x27;t like something that people do for fun, just walk away. The reason these things happen, that we see &quot;bad&quot; examples is not because people are getting worse at doing this stuff, it&#x27;s because new people are finding it easier to get started. Angry diatribes like this are just attacks at new people when they need encouragement and guidance.<p>[0] Well, to a degree. His field is &quot;clever hacking of X86 assembly&quot;. A similarly &quot;clever hacking of dynamic programming languages&quot; exists that necessitates completely different techniques.

Anything you make, I will make, too.&quot; And God answers, &quot;Okay, well, how about a man?&quot; And the man replied, &quot;No problem. We know chemistry and biology and genetics, we can synthesize everything we need to make a man.&quot; He bends down and starts to pick up some dirt and some other materials to start making amino acids when God interrupts him, &quot;Hey now, go get your own dirt.&quot;",1427130659

In contrast, anything that calls itself a &quot;manifesto&quot; is apt to sound a little arrogant and abrasive out of the box.<p>That said, I have to admit that anything associated with the word &quot;gantt&quot; puts my back up, as Gantt Charts are almost never an appropriate tool for project management: they were developed to plan the invasion of Europe, and on that scale they are necessary and useful.

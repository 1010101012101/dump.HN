7984230,comment,7982774,7983946,2,0,asgard1024,,,"Depending on what you mean by &quot;spending&quot;. I see spending as an irreversible process, where someone actually decides how to convert resources to products. You could say the more you do that, the bigger the economy.<p>However, rich people don&#x27;t engage in this sort of spending as much. Lot of their &quot;spending&quot; is in reality just circulation of money through rent extraction. And it&#x27;s important for them to do that, because that allows them to keep their power. For instance, if they loan it to a person, that person becomes dependent on them.<p>Your idea is based on flawed premise that one has only two rational options what to do with money - invest (in a narrow sense, to make actual decision how to convert one resource to another) or consume. In reality, there is a third option, which is similar to saving, that is investing money in power grabbing and rent extraction. While saving doesn&#x27;t give you an advantage to other players, the rent extraction may.<p>This was already explained by Marx long time ago, when he described the capitalist as someone who wants to create more money from money he has through profit from investment. And more recently this was explained by Piketty, that you can have a situation in economy where rich people try to &quot;invest&quot; into rent extraction and not producing more goods or services.",1404406761

Case in point: my last gig gave me something like 0.15% of the company vested over 4 years. I left after 2.5 years and the equity did nothing to keep me there even though the company was in a reasonable place financially. Why? Because 0.15% * the valuation * likelihood of a sale * sale price * likelihood of my shares actually being given any value in a sale is effectively 0.<p>Everyone keeps suggesting that when evaluating a compensation package, one should not count equity for anything since it&#x27;s worthless. Well, it is nearly worthless, unless you happen to hit the startup that becomes Facebook, Google, Dropbox, etc. <i>and</i> you get in early enough (usually only employee #1 gets over 1%). So why bother even offering a worthless piece of compensation. The startup might as well include a bunch of lottery tickets with every paycheck instead.",1404406758

7984187,comment,7973178,7980738,1,0,waps,,,"The problems I find with your argument are that you are taking a partially true statement and extending it as if it fits the whole of science. Yes there are parts of physics theories that support direct verifiability. The double slit experiment with electrons is not one of them. After all, nobody has ever seen an electron, only indirect observation is possible. You can see the result on phosphor, you can measure the induced voltage, ... none of these are direct observations.<p>But with the double slit experiment we are not that far from direct observation. Let&#x27;s take the theory that there is a black hole in the center of the milky way ... would you care to explain to me how I can observe that directly ?<p>So your statements are misleading. Some tiny parts of some physics theories are directly verifiable. Some are indirectly verifiable. Most current ones are not really verifiable at all. Astronomic theories are both especially important for physics, they are used as support arguments, and let&#x27;s just say they are very good examples of indirect observations, and there are plenty of historical arguments for physics theories coming out of astronomy that turned out to be wrong. One of the initial proofs of relativity theory, the measurement of the movement of Saturn&#x27;s moons was a wrong measurement. It lead to the right conclusion, but the measurement itself was incorrect, which makes it especially interesting to me.<p>But that&#x27;s just peanuts. The real kicker is : some physics theories are known to be wrong (which was the real point of referring to black body radiation : it was a known hole in a theory for almost a century), but we don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re wrong, and nobody&#x27;s ready to dump the theories. E.g. does the standard model match the &quot;real&quot; structure of the universe ? Well, we know it doesn&#x27;t, yet everybody&#x27;s using the standard model. Everybody believes in electrons and positrons and protons and large antiprotons ... yet we know something doesn&#x27;t match up because we can run experiments that don&#x27;t match predicted outcomes of the standard model theories. Have you seen anybody claim that the standard model is wrong ? See anyone dumping it ? I haven&#x27;t. Did I miss something ?<p>Some theories in physics are direct contradictions. Take relativity versus big bang theory for example. Care to explain how the speed of light limit fits in with inflation theory (which as far as I know is still part of the current state of the art) ?<p>TLDR: In physics we have different theories that don&#x27;t really interact, not in the maths part anyway. In order to progress within physics we just assume that you can just pick and choose whatever matches the observed data best. Gravity resistance in neutron stars ? Oh that involves the Pauli exclusion principle ... that sounds cool but the Pauli exclusion principle comes from a theory that ... doesn&#x27;t have gravity. How is this consistent ? Whatever you want to call it, I call foul on this reasoning.<p>But such arguments, while wrong to any logical mind, have one big redeeming quality : they work. That&#x27;s how science really works : part of it is giving us the ability to make cell phones, cpus, ... what have you. Part of it is an interesting story to tell &quot;the public&quot;, and to put on grant requests of course. Part of it is interest and what appears to make sense to human minds, however broken the logic is.<p>But all of it flies in the face of the idea that science, without pick-and-choose tactics, satisfies any reasonable standard scientists sometimes claim it does. Physics, taken as a whole, doesn&#x27;t satisfy either falsifiability, verifiability, or predictive ability, and you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find even small portions of it that have no known, shall we say &quot;bugs&quot; : observations that don&#x27;t match, math that doesn&#x27;t quite work. Hell, the theories don&#x27;t even satisfy mutual consistency.<p>I remember the first physics lesson I had. I remember it because of the math the professor used. You start with constructing an equation for the path of an electron flying through a magnetic field. Then there was five minues of &quot;this is nearly zero&quot; (professor scratches that part of the equation out). This matches that, not exactly, but under normal circumstances they&#x27;re more or less equal (scratches two non-matching things from above and below the fraction line) ... I was shocked. But let&#x27;s be fair here : while yes, there are better methods for this particular problem, but this is how physics works. Mathematical rigour destroys most physics methods.<p>The argument you&#x27;re making about maths is similarly flawed. You&#x27;re taking a single example, and extending it around the entire theory, which is not a valid reasoning.<p>The axiom of choice was one of the initial tries to fix incompleteness, it&#x27;s a debacle because the attempt was flawed. Also maybe pertinent here : English is not my first language, so if debacle is not the right word, just pretend I used another. It was triumphantly held up as a solution to incompleteness, and was flat-out wrong.<p>As for Gentzen&#x27;s proof, proving that one theory is consistent using another theory that may not be consistent itself, while a remarkable achievement, does not resolve the problem Godel raised. It does not pull us out of the mud.<p>And let&#x27;s not be too strict here. E.g. I realize what you mean by referring to Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument, but technically it is not applicable to logical statements. You&#x27;re right that I confused relativity and quantization when referring to black body radiation.",1404406342

Rich people are <i>individuals</i> that control large amounts of wealth.  This is opposed to groups of people who collectively control large amounts of wealth.  A superintendent of a large school district can control a billion dollars of wealth but that doesn&#x27;t make him or her rich (though they make a good salary I&#x27;d still classify them, personally, as solidly middle class).<p>And it certainly does matter if we rely increasingly on fewer and fewer individuals (due to increasing inequality) to make economic decisions for everyone.

7984025,comment,7966247,7968319,1,0,geebee,,,"I&#x27;m, very, very late responding to this, so apologies for that.<p>I agree that getting into a top law or medical school is exceptionally difficult.  Here&#x27;s the admissions page for ucsf<p><a href=""http://meded.ucsf.edu/admissions/successful-applicant-profile-class-2017"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meded.ucsf.edu/admissions/successful-applicant-profil...</a><p>Interestingly, they don&#x27;t give admissions rates, but we can see that only 6% even get an interview.  The numbers themselves are high, too.  Looks like about 95%ile MCAT scores, and a high (nearly 3.8) GPA overall and in the sciences.<p>Law has similar numbers, though LSAT scores tend to be a bit higher - above 98%ile.  My guess is that this is because law doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;weeder&quot; courses in pre-med, so you do have a lot of high GPAs in history or other relatively easy majors.<p>Engineering is a very, very difficult comparison to make, because it truly is not the same thing.  Licensure is unusual, largely limited to a couple of specialties, and happens (with exceptions) at the undergrad level anyway.  Legally speaking, you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> an MS or PhD for anything, and you rarely need a BS either.  This of course is a big factor when thinking about admissions and attrition rates.<p>Still, there is a large PR effort in the US to convince the public and young people that there is a shortage of US Citizens going into &quot;STEM&quot; graduate programs.  I&#x27;ve posted a  link to a RAND study that concludes that this aversion is rational and market driven when you consider the pay and career prospects relative to the &quot;professions&quot; (medicine and law, as well as dentistry, MBA programs, even nursing and pharmacy... in SF, dental hygienists earn, on average, about 98% of a software developer&#x27;s median salary).<p>Here&#x27;s a link the RAND study<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>It&#x27;s very difficult to compare with graduate engineering programs, since they tend to be specialized at the degree level (rather than through residency in medicine or career choices later with law).  But looking at entering class profiles, top engineering programs appear to be very selective.  Not <i>as</i> selective in terms of admissions rates as medicine or law, but I think this is more a function of very heavy course requirements for admission (you can major in anything for law, and you can do pre-med in 2 years, whereas to apply to an MS or PhD program in engineering, you tend to need essentially 4 years of exceptionally difficult specialized coursework).<p>So admissions aren&#x27;t really notably easier for graduate work in engineering, undergrad prep is very hard... and yet, attrition rates are brutal.  Overall, engineering is the best of the bunch where PhD attrition rates are concerned, at about 35%.  In hard sciences, these typically go up to about 50%.  This is for a cohort that has gotten top grades in majors like physics and scored at least above the 90%ile on standardized tests, usually quite a bit higher.<p>In short - I&#x27;m willing to agree that getting into law school is tough, but not any tougher than getting in to a top grad school in engineering (probably much easier, when you consider the coursework you need to take for engineering), and getting <i>through</i> law school, based on attrition rates, appears to be <i>far, far easier</i>.  Even med school appears far easier from an attrition rate point of view.  They&#x27;re hard working, sure, but so are grad students in STEM.  I just don&#x27;t think hard work can explain a difference in attrition rates between 50-100 times higher.<p>Of course, like I said, you don&#x27;t need a PhD or an MS to do anything in engineering, so maybe they&#x27;re not really useful as a point of analysis here.  The reason I bring it up is that there is still a strong PR push to get more young US citizens (or these days, women) into STEM graduate programs, and yet the numbers are horrendous for that path.  Difficult coursework, sky high attrition, and - at the elite level, since we&#x27;re talking about &quot;best and brightest&quot; - mediocre outcomes compared to medicine and, at the elite level, perhaps law as well (and many other fields).",1404404955

For a big stint of that I built systems that aim to prevent medication errors in hospitals by telling clinicians when doses were due, etc.<p>I know of at least two incidents where code that I wrote failed in a way that (due to some edge-case concurrency in one case, and daylight savings time in another case) didn&#x27;t make it clear to a nurse that another nurse had given a medication to a patient and the patient received a double-dosage of a pretty severe drug.<p>Imagine getting that call. It&#x27;s every bit as fucking terrible and humbling as you&#x27;d think.<p>Far more numerous (thankfully) were the calls that we got reporting that we stopped double dosages or even order-of-magnitude label misreadings on drugs. I know of more than a handful of instances that code I wrote may have literally saved a life.<p>I&#x27;ve been lucky to have found myself at companies that take this stuff really, really seriously. It&#x27;s a really hard balance to strike when failure is as devastating as it can be in healthcare, but the status quo is pretty terrifying also. In general every health IT shop&#x27;s culture finds some balance between making decisions based on fear, and trying to achieve a velocity that allows problems to be fixed quickly and the greatest positive impact possible against the problem they&#x27;re solving.<p>I talk to a lot of people who want to work on &quot;big/real problems&quot; and list &quot;healthcare&quot; as one of them but when it comes down to it are often pretty freaked out about the stakes.

At the top of the pyramid are highly technical users who spend all day not minding spending all day dealing with hostile and spiteful interfaces to get trivial tasks done - there are very few of these people in the world. As you progressively work your way down the pyramid users become progressively less inclined to tolerate this nonsense and the number of people in that segment grows.<p>At the very bottom, the largest population of possible users, are people who&#x27;s toleration of any sort of confusion of nonsense from their computer device things is at zero.<p>As a company, you have to decide how far down this pyramid you want to target your products. The lower down the pyramid, the more work you have to put into your product on the usability side, you may even decide to ignore higher tiers on the pyramid because you can only put so much effort into a product, and the upper bits of the pyramid represent an astonishingly small fraction of the market space.<p>AOL did one thing really well, they decided early on to target the absolute bottom tier of the pyramid that they could recognize. This is pre-Internet days where practically everything you ever wanted to do with a computer was user-hostile. They didn&#x27;t give two shits about users who knew all of the Hayes command set by heart, because those users were 1% of the entire possible market and supporting them was as much effort as supporting the 99% they were trying to get money out of.<p>The Internet didn&#x27;t even immediately kill AOL, as in their own controlled user interface. It really was easier to start &quot;your AOL&quot; wait a minute for the funny sounds to stop and type in &quot;gardening&quot; to get more than enough information about that subject. You could even guess at keywords, &quot;cars&quot; or &quot;cooking&quot; probably took you someplace as well.<p>The Internet started at the absolute top-most part of the pyramid and we&#x27;ve spent decades trying to get it to work where all the money is, the bottom bits. It hasn&#x27;t helped that there were all sorts of unexplainable (to the common user) hanger ons and hatefulness that users have had to deal with along the way. But every time we improve the experience a little, high fives everywhere and the bottom lines jumps another million dollars.<p>Anybody remember the old ways to setup an email client? Remember all the little bits and pieces of information you needed, POP3 or IMAP mail server, SMTP server, authentication, encryption methods, different user/pass for sending and receiving, opening firewalls, setting spam filters, etc?<p>Then it got better. The last time I set up Thunderbird I supplied it with approximately two pieces of information, my email address and my password.<p>Do you remember how an AOL user set up their mail? They didn&#x27;t.<p>Why is this important? Because that other stuff is hateful to the user. It&#x27;s also pointless. It never should have gotten to the point where I needed all that stuff just to get my email. But that&#x27;s what happens when you design software for the top of the pyramid. You can make it as obtuse, undocumented/poorly documented and hostile as you want, and there will still be a small population at the top of that pyramid who won&#x27;t mind dealing with it.<p>I was pondering the other day the vast reduction in websites (and other internet services) that I typically visit and use in a day from 10-20 years ago. Pretty much I use, HN, Reddit, Facebook, gmail and youtube for fun and my corporate equivalents for work. I felt sad for a moment because the internet used to seem so much more chaotic and vibrant.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that 10-20 years ago I&#x27;d have spent time on USENET, telnetted into something, fought with my mail client, hit as many ftp servers as web sites, probably at least 1 gopher site and more. I&#x27;d have probably searched for any search term on multiple search engines to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing any results and more. 20 years ago I would have even supplemented my time on the Internet with time on local BBS&#x27;s, each with different interfaces and services.<p>But today what&#x27;s the point? I didn&#x27;t like calling into all those BBSs, or going to all those sites. One site with all those services is much less user-friction to deal with. I didn&#x27;t like mucking around in some command-line ftp client, why shouldn&#x27;t I just have a link on a webpage someplace to download something? Why should I telnet into some message board to talk about the Amiga when some meta-message board service lets me just go to /r/amiga? What&#x27;s the point of gopher when the web works so much better? Why USENET when I can find better, less spammy conversation on HN or reddit?<p>And guess what? It&#x27;s even better than that! I can shop on-line, I don&#x27;t have to drive anywhere, deal with parking, deal with people, deal with the heat.

Would it be possible that with a minimum wage hike that the individual costs for some parts of the supply chain the rise in costs could be much higher? Depends on the businesses involved. Meaning, what&#x27;s good for one business is not necessarily good for every business.<p>What if a store has to raise their prices not by 35%, but more like 60% because of increased costs from their supply chain.

Anybody getting this new increase in pay going to get hit with more taxes? I never see any of these articles discuss that aspect of it at all.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but your logic seems overly simplified because it would seem to support the notion that since raising the minimum wage is good for everybody then why not just raise it to $50 an hour or $100 an hour?

Computers are much better a processing larger chunks of data linearly rather than small bits of data. However the question to ask is how much data do you have to batch together to get good throughput? There are diminishing returns and you stop getting much benefit after about 1MB in my experience. So this line of reasoning will not get you to additional latency of more than a few seconds, it definitely won&#x27;t get you to a 24 hour batch data cycle.<p>Actually because we think this tradeoff is important we allow consumers from Kafka to specify how much data they want accumulated on the server before the server should complete their fetch request. The default is 1 byte, which means respond as soon as there is anything new for me, which optimizes latency. However setting this to a higher number will reduce round-trips and optimize throughput by avoiding lots of small fetches. This allows you to trade a small amount of latency for throughput. (In either case you can bound the waiting with a timeout so the latency is never worse than some maximum delay even if sufficient data hasn&#x27;t arrived).<p>In any case when doing re-processing, as described in this article, there will always be lots of data accumulated and you will always fetch chunks of the maximum size you have configured (say 1MB).

We cannot assume that their cost of living will not increase in some way after the hike.<p>They may indeed be already paying above minimum wage. But I pointed out that it&#x27;s likely that many people who are not making minimum wage will see an increase in pay or will demand it. Let&#x27;s say our small shop has two employees who make $10 an hour. They both now make $15 an hour, good for them. But that extra cost could have been a third employee. Let&#x27;s say they hire that third employee anyway. Now the original two want a raise because it isn&#x27;t right that a new hire makes the same as the experienced two.<p>Granted, very simplified example that&#x27;s rife with potential issues.<p>So, if Wal-Mart&#x27;s costs go up they raise prices. You are assuming that the small business won&#x27;t have to do the same?

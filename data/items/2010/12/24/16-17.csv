2037511,comment,2037328,2037459,0,0,bradleyland,,,"If you're using Node as an app server in the context of a larger website with other components, yes. However, if your app is primarily Node.js driven, you may not want Apache standing in the way. Node.js is used to drive some really cutting edge services like WebSockets. I have no idea how gracefully Apache proxies something like WebSockets to a back end app server. I have a feeling the Apache worker process gets tied up for the duration of the socket session. That's not good.<p>If your entire website is run by your Node.js app, a better approach would be to use Node.js as your primary app/web server, and embed your static assets using a separate domain. For example, you'd use static.mydomain.com for all your static assets, which would point to Apache/Nginx, while your page requests are all handled by Node.js.",1293209706

At least, I would hope one wouldn't feel that way. More than most other communities I've experienced online, HN isn't very cliquey nor very focused on one's vital stats - there are people from all corners, all genders, and all races here but it's already anonymous enough that it's hard to tell. Being a geek and taking an interest in new things are probably the only prerequisites to be ""in"" here.

White Americans, whether liberal or conservative, take it as a given that there's always some part of the city dominated by blacks where gunfire is heard at night and the cops are afraid to go. If you probe even a little bit you find that most white Americans, even nominally liberal ones, think blacks have lower capacities than they do. This seems to me, with my Canadian attitudes, like a shocking abandonment of a large part of your citizenry.</i><p>Wow, so you just did what Americans are always accused of doing - paint large groups of people with one giant brush.<p>True racism in America I think has shrunk considerably.  The problem is that racism is now commonly used to label any not so nice statistics about any given group of people.  Years ago when Bill Cosby pointed out that strong families raised better kids he was called racist.  He was just looking at the facts that over 1/2 of the single parent families out there are black[1], and kids from single parent families generally don't do as well as those from a 2 parent family.<p>When it comes to bad areas in large cities nearly every city has at least one such area, although racial groups may differ.  There used to be places in LA where simply wearing a blue or red shirt will get you shot.  This is not something made up or in the minds of white people.  Even when I lived in a smallish city it had streets or areas that even police avoided.  Heck, even my black friends avoided the area.<p>I also strongly disagree that 'most white Americans' think blacks have lower capacities than they do.  That's complete BS.  I don't know anyone who thinks that, and I certainly don't think that is true.<p>[1] <a href=""http://family.jrank.org/pages/1574/Single-Parent-Families-Demographic-Trends.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://family.jrank.org/pages/1574/Single-Parent-Families-De...</a>",1293206872

Unfortunately, I know where this is going to lead, however. My mother visits a site that embeds WMV-based videos for her Russian TV shows. It was not until she purchased a new MacBook that I realized that this was the site she visits 90% of the time she's on the Internet. I thought installing Flip4Mac would solve her crisis, and it partially did, video and audio came in through Firefox as expected. With that said, seeking within the video does not work as naturally well as it does in IE. In fact, it doesn't work at all. The end result was I purchased my mother VMWare Fusion 3, a copy of Windows XP, and ended up having to tutor her on the usage of a virtual machine, the mechanics between how to seamlessly work with the two operating systems, etc. I still get daily tech support calls that eat up a lot of my personal time, now not only for the MacBook, but for VMWare Fusion, Windows XP and IE/Safari usage.<p>The web developer in me loathes IE for obvious reasons which will not be reiterated here for the billionth time.

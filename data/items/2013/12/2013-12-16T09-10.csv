6913797,comment,6913528,6913528,2,0,IsaacL,,,"Here&#x27;s a question: for a decent frontend developer who&#x27;s still far away from the &quot;master&quot; level he describes here, is it worth chasing mastery or might it be better to branch out to other skills, like management?<p>I think I&#x27;m a solid frontend developer, but I&#x27;m a few years professional experience away from the level he describes here. I know my way around HTML, CSS and the various browser quirks - though I&#x27;m still learning the idiosyncrasies he describes here. I&#x27;ve written a ~10000-line app in Angular.js, but my Javascript code is still sloppy, and is nowhere close to my knowledge of Ruby. I&#x27;m gradually picking up the basics of design and UI as I go, but that&#x27;s a whole other mountain which I could climb for years.<p>&quot;That guy I offered that car to (not really) took a job at a startup and he’s the guy. He’s THE front end developer for their product which doesn’t exist yet. He gets to point to that thing, a year or two from now when it’s worth a bazillion dollars (I do wish him luck, after all) and say, “I did that.” There are people out there, right now, who get to point at Twitter, Facebook, Gmail and Google Maps, at the Iphone’s UI, at Github, at the YouTube player – stuff used by millions upon millions of people – and say, “I did that.”&quot;<p>Thing is, few products are built by one superhero. I&#x27;m wondering if, rather than transform yourself into a magical-unicorn designer/hacker - it might be better to get solid at development, solid at design, but aim to only get good enough that you can manage people who are <i>better</i> at you in those areas?",1387187952

6913795,comment,6913528,6913528,3,0,gexla,,,"I would tell anyone getting into web development right now that if you want to be in high demand, become a JS wizard. And of course, the front-end is part of the package unless you box yourself into Node.<p>To get to the level the author is talking about is quite daunting. I feel that JS is sort of a second class citizen to most back-end developers. Web projects which are touched by an HTML / CSS developer, a designer and a back-end developer are common (not always a team, maybe they are all contracted to do their bits as needed and don&#x27;t work closely together.) Often the heavy lifting with the JS goes to the back-end dev because the HTML / CSS dev isn&#x27;t really a programmer beyond Googling for Jquery snippets. The problem is, the back-end developer usually isn&#x27;t a JS wizard either. A lot of developers I come across make a mess of copy and paste in the JS. And I don&#x27;t spend enough time in JS for it to feel natural to me. If I could add one superpower to make my life way easier, it would be the things the author is talking about.<p>I see a lot of threads with people asking what to learn. If you are going to be a web developer, then JS  is always a damn good answer (or if you already know JS, go back and level up.)  I really love to spend time on the server side. I want to put my time into Linux, spend a lot of time in Go and learning other languages. But that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense for a freelance web developer.<p>ETA: Actually, high in demand is probably the wrong way to put it. You don&#x27;t have to be in high demand. Small markets can be as lucrative or better than much larger markets. And then there the fact that there is a lot more to being a successful web developer than being a code-monkey. But the things the author described is certainly a super power in web development.",1387187931

If it was a concious decision to sort by name, then the description would be something more like, &quot;when I am sorting my folders by name, I&#x27;d rather sort by date, so I put the date in the name.&quot;<p>Folders do tend to have Date Created metadata, so in theory you could &quot;sort folders by created date&quot; rather than by name, but where that data is stored and how that data changes as the files are moved around is pretty opaque, so it makes lots of sense to not rely on it.",1387187664

Furthermore, if an attack is in progress, this declaration does not require a majority vote, the president merely needs to find (what he reasonably believes to be) the highest ranking member.<p>So one (probable) difference would have been that president Bush would not have asked Congress what to do if Congress was directly attacked. He would have simply decided what to do and done it, after having received the declaration from Nancy Pelosi.<p>This would have lead to the combination of having a single deciding vote of what to do with the armed forces at the command of a single politician, making for easy and quick decisions and the entire country clamoring for revenge.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it would necessarily have lead to immediate counterattack, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t have lowered the odds of that happening.",1387185696

It would also likely disadvantage the person they are working with who now has to share resources. Not to mention the fact that if this person doesn&#x27;t own an iPhone they either won&#x27;t know how to use it or won&#x27;t be quick at using it slowing them down (bad in an exam situation). The students who do own iPhones will be faster and will be better because they are more experienced with the tools - not because they are better students.",1387184816

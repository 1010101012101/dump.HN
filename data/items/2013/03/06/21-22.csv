5334309,comment,5333559,5333559,1,0,Tichy,,,"I think the way controllers work here is similar to Ruby on Rails? It confused me in Rails at first (coming from the Java world), but I think it is essentially just a hack to allow for ""easier"" passing of data to the view (the controller gets exposed to the view). So instead of scope.whatever = ""hello world"" you can write this.whatever = ""hello world"" (OK not really shorter, but something like that).<p>That usage of Controllers is not part of the MVC pattern, I'd say. It's just a recycling of the controller instance - not forbidden, just confusing if you wonder what it has to do with MVC.<p>Actually it's also the RoR way to have short lived controllers (a controller is instantiated for every request), other frameworks use one static controller instance instead.",1362607175

Also raising the minimum wage possibly causes some (slight) additional unemployment.<p>So what's the overall stimulus effect on the economy? Unclear. It appears as if the second study on the page you linked to might try to address it, though it looks to me like more of an advocacy paper than an impartial study. That's just from a quick glance though. I will try to read further.<p>My overall impression of the minimum wage debate is that it has a very high ratio emotion :: impact. Whatever overall effects it has on the economy appear to be quite small (almost within the noise), and yet it always generates a lot of intense argument.

And most studies show that the rises in the minimum wage do increase unemployment, though there have been a few studies that showed the opposite.  But still, the consensus among economists about minimum wage is about as strong as it is among climatologists about global warming.<p>But that isn't the same as saying that a minimum wage is bad for poor people.  If many people see their wages rise for every person who loses their job then maybe that's something we want.  And the evidence does say that wage gains to the people making the new minimum exceed the wage loses of the people thrown out of work.<p>But since ~90% of the money for those wage gains ends up coming from higher prices, we'd be much better off just raising taxes and handing the money to people earning less than we think they should.  That way the costs would fall progressively rather than repressively, and we wouldn't see any increase in unemployment at all.<p>EDIT:  And while it's true that Australia has a very high minimum wage and low unemployment, most industries that would be minimum wage in the US have special exceptions from the minimum wage in Australia.  The number of people earning 7$ an hour in Australia isn't that different per capita than in the US.<p>[1] That minimum wage industries are monopsomies and have similar cost structures.",1362606339

So they're totally right that there's a significant amount of state in the router, in that that's where you define which model and controller (and, depending on how fancy you get, what views and templates) to use on a given page. So those are essentially state.<p>The state that can make a controller fat is essentially state that's too important for a view but doesn't need to be universal to the page. For example, with my Dropbox controller, the controller has a state property that handles the various permutations of the state of syncing (i.e. it could be doing nothing, currently saving, done saving, failed saving, etc.). This state is set by the controller on the controller, and used by multiple views to determine things like which label a progress modal should have.<p>For example, if you had a controller representing a list, you might want to keep track of which item is selected on the controller. That way, if there are multiple views that can act on the currently selected item (for example - you might have a list item view that has a template that renders the item, and then a separate view that are buttons that trigger actions that act on the current item), they all have access to it.<p>Plus, I always think of state defined in a router as being limited to specific pages/routes, whereas some of my controllers are used on several different routes.",1362606144

5334047,comment,5324100,5327036,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"That's a decent explanation that covers part of what monads are, although since it uses Python, it cannot express the type goodness that comes with monads in languages such as Haskell and, more recently, Rust.<p>Both Haskell and Rust exploit compile-time typing to avoid having null (or nil, or None, or whatever) pointers in the language -- something which eliminates an entire class of errors that plague most of today's languages, including Python.<p>The reason they can do this is that with Maybe, the wrapped value is either something (Just a) or nothing (Nothing). Since Nothing is a type (more technically a type <i>constructor</i>), not a value -- unlike something like Python's None, or C++'s null -- it cannot be passed as the value to a function which expects a valid pointer to a different type:<p><pre><code>    -- This won't work\n    setUserName(user, Nothing)\n</code></pre>\nAnother thing about Haskell is that the IO system relies on monads for a very specific reason, or maybe two reasons. Since Haskell is lazy and pure, it needs a mechanism to express the fact that a function has actually done some work, even though -- from the compiler's point of view -- it hasn't. For example, consider a function call such as:<p><pre><code>    putStrLn ""Hello world""\n</code></pre>\nWell, this function has nothing particular to return; in most languages it would be a ""void"" function or return a null value. But this would not work in Haskell, which is designed to (1) optimizes function calls that return the same value (so if you call this more than once, Haskell would normally just evaluate it once), and (2) completely eliminate function calls whose values are not used.<p>For this reason, Haskell's putStrLn has to return a unique value every time it's run, just to convince the compiler that it should not be optimized away. And so it does -- this is the IO monad. putStrLn returns a new IO value for every call. Since it always returns a new value, this ensures that Haskell won't optimize it away.<p>There is another aspect to the IO monad: Haskell being lazy and pure, it's allowed to evaluate everything out of order. The way the IO monad is passed, baton-style, between each operation ensures that the compiler is forced to evaluate I/O operations in the sequence they appear in the code. Well, mostly. You still have to be careful; you can easily end up in a situation where a read is only evaluated <i>after</i> you closed a file, for example.<p>(I'm not a Haskell expert, so I would be happy to be corrected on any point. Note I have glossed over some technical details in my explanation that would just complicate things.)",1362604922

But playing devil's advocate...<p>> Crashing BTC with stolen BTC is free.<p>Yes, agree that you could definitely crash the bid price by dumping 50k stolen BTC. This might also happen naturally if someone holding lots of BTC is forced to sell to get USD quick (e.g. ""oh no, huge unexpected medical bill, tax bill, fine..."").<p>[Not sure it's ""free"" though; what about opportunity cost?]<p>> The presumption is that a lot of people right now would sell their BTC when they see BTC drop down to $5. People panic when they see losing value... and you buy back the BTC you sold at that point.<p>So during your buyback, you'll be bidding against all the bitcoin loons who also want to buy after you crashed the price. These people are just irrationally exuberant about internet play money and have been waiting for the price to hit $5 or $10 again.<p>You also have to convince the other loons who are holding lots of BTC that their play money is now worthless. You need to convince them to put down the cheetos, transfer BTC to mtgox and plug those sell orders in there. I'm not convinced crashing the bid price alone would be enough to achieve that.\nAs well as manipulating price, you also need to kill the enthusiasm and belief.<p>I think to really trigger some selling for your buyback, you would want to carry out a smear campaign at the same time. You want to inject some fake news articles (either via hacking or social engineering) and create confusion on the forums. Convince people that bitcoin is doomed (e.g. ""all BTC exchanges to be illegal, say regulators""). Or that you have a technical attack on the network.<p>Pub the articles first, smear forums, then DoS forums (to prevent corrections), then trigger the ""mother sell""... that would give you the best chance of success for the attack you are thinking of.<p></devilsadvocate><p>What I wanted to finish with though, is that anyone trying to pull something this would have to actually believe that BTC are valuable, or equivalently that suckers will pay more for them later.

This is from personal experience using Chartboost and revmob. To achieve a steady 1k daily bootups, you will need about 150 downloads/day. This is a steady state equilibrium I've found true for my apps, it takes into account new user acquisition rate and churn rate (which is surprisingly high, from my stats only about 80% of users will even open you app, and of those 80% only 30% will open it on the next day, after 30 days you can expect about 5% of users to still be using your app).<p>There's a lot to be said about App Store monetization but take these numbers into account when considering whether to ad ads to your app. Btw all of the above is for full screen interstitial ads shown once on app launch.

This still misses what I think is the most important part of design debt, how much longer it takes to implement new ideas because you are paying the ""the pieces this depends on were rushed and don't work/integrate/extend well"" tax (I guess I should call this ""interest payments"" to not mix metaphors) .<p>You can't measure debt as you take it on though, the best you can do is estimate how much work it will be to fix it later (and that's only if it needs to be fixed later, maybe you get lucky and your hacked up code just stays good enough).

There's no ""Dropbox model,"" just other models that I'm using this controller to sync. Controllers are not simply an intermediary between models and views, they are an intermediary between <i>state</i> and views.<p>> I'm trying my best to reconcile this with the notion that a controller (classically speaking) is supposed to ... well control the view.

The view handles any user interaction, and then uses the controller to change the state of various bits (whether calling methods in the controller or simply updating properties on it).<p>To sum up: model is data, controller is state (including instance(s) of models), and the view is user interaction. Templates can bind to properties on any of these. Routes are what hook these components together depending on the page.",1362604409

Here is my take:<p>Apple will 're-invent' it in ten years time and market it to us all for $1500 as a luxury product that all Apple nuts will be a 'have to have' product. Google will then release Google Glass+ two years later, which is free, but advertises products and services to you based on where you are and what you look at constantly 24-7.<p>Wired will then publish an article that states how often men really look at women's breasts, because Google released anonymous data usage of Google Glass+ LiveStreetView (I claim the inventor's rights to this btw).<p>Microsoft will come late to the party with Microsoft 'Goggles', which confuses everyone, because although looks good, everyone thinks must be crap, because Microsoft released it. Steve Balmer finally retires. Everyone in Microsoft breaths a sigh of relief.<p>Nix guys are just laughing their heads off. They've had retinal implants for 5 years and record everything to their private clouds.<p>Insurers start to demand that all people wear a Glass Recorder for insurance purposes, and before you know it, all recordings legally have to be saved by the government to prevent terrorism.<p>Future looks rosy through those rose tinted spectacles...

To me your comment sounds like:<p>""I have been walking through mazes my whole life with my eyes closed, and I make progress by feeling the walls with my hands.  In order to get through each maze I need to remember lots of facts about how the walls in the different mazes feel when I touch them.  If I opened my eyes now, it would take too much time, and be too painful to adjust to the light.  I never tried to open my eyes, and even though a lot of people keep telling me it's a lot easier to get through mazes with your eyes open, I think they are wrong.  Besides, the few and far between times I get stuck, I can always ask one of the people who can see where I should go next.

I'm no fan of the prohibition on circumvention tools, but I don't think that's the scenario that worries me. A party doing that looks to be engaged in some kind of entrapment scheme.<p>>""Substantial non-infringing uses"" is the standard the court set for things which <i>could</i> subject you to ""secondary liability"" for acts of infringement. The tools are legally separate concepts (which is why the DMCA codified them)<p>I understand that it isn't the standard that applies to circumvention tools right now. But it seems like an exemption that <i>ought to</i> apply if the prohibition on circumvention tools is to stand at all. And amending the law to that effect is likely going to be a lot easier politically than repealing the prohibition in its entirety. Can you suggest some other language that would be preferable? (I mean obviously ""get rid of it altogether"" would be preferable.)<p>> the first amendment traditionally prevents the government from criminalizing speech which could assist others in breaking the law.<p>I think they addressed this in the 2600 DeCSS case.[1] Something like: Code is speech, but it's also functional, and you lose the First Amendment argument on the functionality. Which I'm not really convinced of the logic of (isn't all speech ""functional"" in that it provides information that allows you to do something with it?), but that's apparently the counterargument you'll get.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_v._Reimerdes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_v._Reimerdes</a>",1362603664

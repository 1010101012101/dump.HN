4289417,comment,4285157,4288533,1,0,shasta,,,"After researching this briefly, it seems that the earliest ""patents"" in England weren't awarded to systematically encourage anything in particular, but were merely monopoly grants given by the monarch for whatever reason (e.g. as reward for X, I'll give you a monopoly on Y for 20 years).  The French apparently developed a system that treated inventions as property.<p>Regardless of the <i>historical</i> motivation for patents, the reason for the inclusion of patents and copyrights into the US constitution and law was clearly to encourage new invention, not just to get inventors to disclose what they would have invented anyway.   The US constitution was crafted in the middle of the industrial revolution, as we moved away from master craftsmen to big industry where it's hard to keep secrets.<p><i>As for the idea that you could never, ever tell whether somebody invented the same thing independently from another</i><p>Of course you might occasionally be able to prove convincingly that you came to an invention independently, but in general you can't.  What's your point?  Why do you think the US adopted a first to invent rule rather than a first to file rule?  If the goal is just to encourage disclosure, then we'd have the latter right?  First one to tell us how it's done wins!  But that's not the rule we have, and the reason is that primary purpose of patents is to encourage new invention.",1343191941

They hate people who are disingenuous. They don't care too much about projections or future plans. They just want to see how good your team is.<p>From everyone else in the industry (those looking for investment, those who have found investment, executives in large companies, etc.) I hear a completely different story. Tell them the world. Make projections bigger than you think is realistic. Talk yourself up. Show interest in things that the VCs are interested in - even if you aren't. Create a story of the future that will please the investors. This is not always exactly the same story you <i>really</i> want to go with.<p>Now I really prefer doing the former to the latter. I just don't know how effective it really is and I hear different stories about how to behave when searching for investment. VCs and angels aren't mind-readers, they aren't super-human, and they have the same failings as everyone else.

4289400,comment,4285461,4288523,2,0,rogerbinns,,,"Thanks for the links, and panic is the usual retort.  My problem is with the boilerplate between methods.  If A calls B calls C calls D calls E which can have issues that A wants to handle (eg try a different IP address) then all the intermediary functions will need code like:<p><pre><code>   foo,bar,err=callX(...)
   if err!=nil:
       return _,_,err
</code></pre>
It is the last two lines of boilerplate that need to be present for virtually every call that makes me uncomfortable.  Developers will start forgetting or not being diligent which causes problems.  Also I think (but don't know) that by the time A gets an Error it won't know what the stack trace is for the original Error.  (The stack traces are extremely useful for logging and analytics not for program behaviour.)<p>Needing to write the boilerplate means it is left out.  For example look at all the hello world examples.  Note how they all ignore any errors from the println.

4289318,comment,4282083,4284126,4,0,gruseom,,,"I noticed another couple issues with the article. One, it doesn't mention the long psychotherapeutic tradition that this movement is clearly part of. Jung, Milton Erickson and R.D. Laing are three prominent examples and there are many more.<p>The other issue is a bias toward childhood sexual abuse as the universal(ish) trauma that hypothetically leads to dissociation and thence to voices. It's not clear how much that is just the article's emphasis vs. the actual movement's bias, but if the latter, it is a gigantic and dangerous red herring. Not because sexual abuse of children doesn't happen or isn't traumatic (of course it does and is), but because the desire to seek it out as a hidden cause for therapeutic purposes is what led to the repressed-memory fiasco of the 80s and 90s. Once people have that preconception about the cause of trauma, they will invent imaginary abuse experiences because they believe finding them is the key to their healing. We've been down that road and it harmed a lot of people.<p>More importantly, it misconstrues the therapeutic process. Factual research to dig up historical causes is not the point (besides being basically impossible). You can establish causes of trauma till the cows come home and it doesn't cure people. This was Erickson's objection to Freud. What heals is integrating experience now. You don't need factual causes to do that. It's a distraction to take therapeutic experiences literally. Their truth is emotional, not factual, and to approach them with preconceptions blocks the process.<p>Those objections aside, I thought the article was really exciting  an oasis of sanity.

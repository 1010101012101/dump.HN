8708507,comment,8704303,8708350,0,0,patio11,,,"Very few people start consulting when immediately out of the womb.  One&#x27;s first client or few clients is often sourced by one&#x27;s personal network: an old day job, a college buddy who went on to work somewhere, someone you met at the local meetup for Pythonistas, etc.<p>After one is actually working as a consultant, one can fix the &quot;I have no testimonials or referrals&quot; problem fairly quickly.  Do great work.  Explicitly ask clients, as part of your aftercare (or before), to give you testimonials and/or referrals.  e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m really happy that this engagement seems to have worked well for everyone.  Over the next couple weeks, I&#x27;ll make myself available to the team if they have any questions about $PROJECT.  Naturally, I&#x27;m also going to be doing the consulting rainmaking dance.  I&#x27;ve really enjoyed working with you -- do you know anyone else who would enjoy working with me?&quot;<p>There are a few other methods which work in a repeatable fashion:<p>a)  Go to events populated by people who can say yes to consulting engagements.  If you cannot be invited to these for whatever reason or if they don&#x27;t exist in your area, throw the event yourself.  Do presentations which relate in <i>any</i> way to the sort of work that you do and then ask people at the end of the presentation to continue the conversation offline if they found it interesting.  You will get 5+ coffee dates per 50 people you present to.  Work on converting 1~2 to clients.<p>b)  Figure out who should be buying your services.  Cold call or cold email them.  This strikes engineers as Black Magick Most Foul, but it is actually pretty routine in business, and clearly works in a reproducible fashion.  Business owners mostly <i>will not be offended</i> if you send them a considered, personalized, one paragraph pitch to explore business together.  Selling and being sold to is <i>what we do all day</i>.<p>c)  I hesitate to mention it, since it is a long-ball sort of strategy and typically will not help you pack Q1 with engagements when starting from a standing start in December 2014, but putting a few writeups of what you do for a living on the Internet (you can use WordPress for this but, crucially, you&#x27;re not shipping blog posts) plus an email capture opportunity can get you a <i>lot</i> of leads over the long run.  Virtually anyone on HN who has ever shipped software with a business impact could spend four hours writing about that experience and get a handful of leads every month from now to forever for that investment.  Assuming one&#x27;s consultancy is known to work given people to sell services to, this strikes me as a good use of one&#x27;s time between engagements.",1417845408

8708498,comment,8708396,8708468,0,0,ChuckFrank,,,"These PEER-TO-PEER TAXI SERVICES (as opposed to genuine ridesharing services) are illegal because privately insured vehicles cannot be used for commercial purposes. The insurance becomes invalidated and so neither the driver nor the passenger are covered. Commercial use is a distinct classification, and Lyft and Uber technically fit under that classification.<p>Lyft and Uber try to get around this by describing passenger payments for these commercially offered rides as &#x27;donations.&#x27; However drivers of these services are not being paid for their volunteer work, they are working for these services. They are working for the money, and in this way it&#x27;s not a donation.<p>Finally ridesharing is a specific gov&#x27;t defined catagory. Only when the costs are ridesharing costs ($0.565/mile or less) can they be viewed as non-commercial.<p>Ridesharing is defined by the US Government (MAP-21 bill) as offering the use of seats in privately owned vehicles to other passengers on a cost-reimbursement basis only.
H.R. 4348 (112th): MAP-21<p>So any fee the exceeds costs-reimbursement is income, and these drivers are working, and they are doing so commercially. So they are commercial drivers, getting paid to drive people around. Ergo they are taxis, and they are required by law to be regulated like taxis.<p>And why legislate taxis? Because of the commercial abuse of the common carrier, in this case the roads. All commercial use of common carriers - roads, canals, highways, etc - they are all regulated to prevent abuse.<p>What does this abuse look like? Too many users.<p>What does Uber and Lyft allow? More users of the common carrier.<p>This is not a new battle, truckers, couriers, ship companies, all fight this - what&#x27;s new is the social distribution that new technology has empowered.<p>For more discussion see -- Hill Brothers Chemical Co. v.

Because none of the numbers involved in #3 are Doubles, Haskell will actually use the Integer type, which is basically a bignum (like integers in Python).<p>The first two are comparing values of type Double, so the instance of Eq for Double is used, which necessarily has some inaccuracies, as shown in the second line, while the last one is using the instance of Eq for Integer. Therefore, the statement that (==) is not transitive for these types is false, because we are talking about different versions of (==) in the first two examples vs. the last one.<p>The trick is that bare numeric literals have type Num a => a, and have their type inferred by their use. The first two examples cause the 2^53 to take on type Double, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t type check (literals with decimals in them have type Fractional a => a, of which Double is the default). The last one doesn&#x27;t have any expressions with decimals, so it uses the Integer type.",1417845003

8708480,comment,8704303,8708281,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>It seems like incorporation, which is cheap and something you should do anyways, mostly fixes it.</i><p>In the UK, we have almost the opposite problem.<p>If you set up a limited company to operate a freelance business, then by default you get to run it like any other business. That means you&#x27;re responsible for paying your own overheads and doing the same administrative paperwork and taxes as any other company. (Who else is going to pay for or do those things, after all?) However, it also means that if you&#x27;re the only owner and director, you can treat most of the profits as dividends rather than salary, which can be a significant tax advantage in some quite common circumstances.<p>Unfortunately, this arrangement was being abused by some people who were in effect working as employees of someone else, who operated with little meaningful independence but were being paid through a company so they could take the tax breaks anyway.<p>Consequently, with probably good intentions but unfortunately not a very good implementation, a set of rules known as IR35 were introduced that basically said if your arrangement works like employment, you&#x27;ll have to treat your contract like employment, with the full tax liability that goes with it.<p>The trouble is that there has never been any useful, objective definition of what counts as working like employment, so all we really have to go on are a few precedents from early cases. In practice, this means every independent professional here who works this way, however legitimately, has this permanent axe hanging over their head. You can pay some accountants for an expert contract review that comes with insurance if they tell you you&#x27;re OK and you are subsequently determined to be within the scope of IR35 anyway, but that&#x27;s a lot of hassle and a significant cost if you do change contracts often, so not everyone does.<p>The tax authorities did make an attempt to codify some more concrete guidelines with their Business Entity Tests a few years ago; those were supposed to give you a clearer idea of how likely you were to fall within the scope of IR35, but the questions were bizarre and completely ignored most of the really important distinctions between an employee and a genuinely independent professional operating as a real one-person company, and the BETs were effectively killed off not so long after they were introduced.<p>This leaves us back at square one. Despite protests from the independent sector about the ongoing burden of IR35 and the lack of evidence that it has ever generated anywhere near the kind of additional tax revenues it was supposed to, successive governments have maintained the rules arguing that if they removed them now then the floodgates would open and suddenly everyone would be going down the disguised employment path costing the government a fortune.<p>In practice, the good news for genuinely independent professionals is that the tax authorities have very limited resources to go after small time tax dodgers, so as long as you&#x27;re behaving reasonably it seems you&#x27;re unlikely to get in much trouble. This brings me back to where I came in, which is a warning that if you really are trying to operate properly as an independent, a very controlling client who is able to impose obvious restrictions like setting working hours is not something you want pushing you to the top of the pile for an IR35 investigation.",1417844553

The plan has been to look into transpiling from fortran to asm.js although my personal feeling is it would be better just to use the C API and compile a module that statically links in the necessary libs.

If you&#x27;re talking about solar desalination in industrially-manufactured greenhouses, I invite you to do the energy audit on that activity. Don&#x27;t forget to account for the energy-opportunity cost of land use.<p>I know there&#x27;s a lot of hype surrounding desalination here, but a centralized energy-sucking plant (owned by the ultra rich naturally) is a counterproductive business-as-usual non-solution.<p>We can get a net-positive energy audit by redesigning our agricultural and storm water management. Right now they&#x27;re designed with exactly the wrong goal in mind — shunt rainwater to the ocean in big straight hardware as fast as possible. This maximizes runoff instead of infiltration, so we&#x27;re simultaneously preventing aquifer recharge and necessitating aquifer pumping by drying out the soil.<p>&quot;Keyline&quot; design—a method of cheaply altering landform to soak water—is probably a good start for these new infiltration maximizing strategies, but this is by no means a solved problem.<p>In California, like any desert, the name of the game is minimizing evaporation. This means all of the above, plus shading (e.g. date palms), sunken beds, buried drip irrigation, and dew/rain harvesting strategies like land imprinting.<p>Proper rainwater management is the lazy hacker&#x27;s desalination. :D",1417843405

As I understand the article these are selection experiments which you can think of as fast evolution in a laboratory setting. I tried to find a good reference for you but this was the best I could find [1]. Essentially they start with a large randomized pool of RNA molecules. They are then able to select out the catalytic RNAs through some process possibly involving a column. At first the number of RNA molecules that exhibit catalytic behavior is infinitesimal. But through PCR they are able to iteratively amplify each generation for the qualities they are looking for, in this case catalytic behavior. At the end of a few generations you have a pool of RNA molecules that exhibit the behavior you want.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lcg.unam.mx/frontiers/files/frontiers/Tuerk%20and%20Gold%201990.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lcg.unam.mx/frontiers/files/frontiers/Tuerk%20and...</a>",1417843151

Some surprising optimizations and failures to optimize become a lot clearer. For example, SSA makes it obvious why there&#x27;s absolutely no penalty for using lots of named temporary register-sized variables.<p>Then learn your particular compilers&#x27; abilities by research and reading your assembly output. If you&#x27;re depending on an optimization, always read the output. You might be pleasantly surprised as often as you&#x27;re disappointed.<p>Understanding the rules of the language are important too.

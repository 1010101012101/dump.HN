5588866,comment,5586519,5588370,4,0,mprovost,,,"> IPv6 was the smallest possible change to fix the problem<p>Really? Going from a 32 bit addressing scheme to 33 bits would double the amount of addresses, pushing the problem a way down the track. Sticking to octets for simplicity, going to 40 bit addressing (five octets) would provide as many addresses as we need for the near future. But they went for 128 bit addressing with IPv6 - I fail to see how that was the smallest change that they could have made.<p>Making it backwards compatible with v4 would have been an even smaller change and we'd probably be using it by now if they hadn't broken compatibility.<p>And how was picking an address size that didn't match up to the native integer size of any common CPU good for performance? Maybe they expected us all to be running 128 bit CPUs by now.",1366631761

If you split all the living things in this world into groups by species, and then check which groups have the biggest say over what's going on, then it's clearly the humans. That's what I meant when I said that the humans rule Earth. I didn't say that all the humans have an equal say. I even didn't say that every human has a bigger say than any animal.<p>It's like saying that the mafia rules southern Italy. They do, but the underlings who do the families's shit jobs don't have a whole lot of input as to how and when, even though they're part of the mafia. Really, it's the obvious interpretation of ""group X rules place Y"".<p>Oh, and, what does the whole pro-life rant have to do with any of this?<p>In fact, the fun part of being the species that rules the planet is that you get to change the rules, or freely go somewhere where the rules match your opinion. You can't do this for your personal perfect cocktail of rules, but you could get rather close.<p>I, for example, currently live in the Netherlands, where there are 37 pro-life people <i>in total</i> and the rest thinks they're lovely people but a bit odd. I share the majority view so I'm good here. If it'd make me very angry however, I'd move to Kentucky.

It gets more difficult as your situation gets more expensive. Most obviously, the higher your expenses, the more you have to work (while also raising your rates) and this cuts down on your ""start-up"" time. With freelancing, your clients have to be your first business priority. You can't give them a lower priority than your start-up. Work / life separation goes away and it can be difficult to fit start-ups in there. If a start-up can be hell, consider that your freelancing would be yet another start-up. Again, it's a great option when you can tame it (which is easy to do when you can live on next to nothing) but it can get really hairy as you need to scale up your earnings. It might still be worth a shot though, you don't know until you try. Who knows, it might blow up and go much better than you expect.<p>Argument for sharing your ideas.<p>Look at the logistical problems that you are running into.You need a lot of talented labor and you need a lot of money. You have no idea if you are going to be able to make money and you haven't yet been able to convince anyone to invest in it. Investors don't even care about the idea so much as they want to make a lot of money. In many cases they are investing not in the right ideas, but the right people.<p>Who is going to make the insane sacrifice with the same passion and the same vision as you? If the idea were easy to steal, then it probably would have been easy enough that you would have built it already.<p>I think people generally get these things backwards anyways. The best time for someone to steal your idea is when you have already built up some traction. At that point, you have done all the hard work so the copy cats can see that your idea is worth stealing. They can also watch your mistakes and possibly roll out a better service. You might as well tell everyone about it now.<p>There is also the possibility that your successful idea may look entirely different than what you are thinking about right now. As soon as you get real users, it starts evolving. It's better to get that process going as soon as possible.<p>Otherwise, I don't have much more info for you. Good luck!",1366630101

I'm in the reverse situation. I've built what I think is a solid niche product, but I need help developing a promotion strategy to get the word out to my target market.<p>My product is an iOS app called Pro Golf Scout. It provides results, stats, player performance trends, and detailed player comparisons for the PGA and European tours. It's targeted at fantasy golfers, sports bettors, sports journalists/bloggers, and other serious fans.<p>Due to its focus and the value I believe it can provide to people in this niche, I've priced it relatively high at $4.99. So far sales have been lackluster, hovering around 1-3 per day after 3 weeks. Given that so far my promotion efforts have fallen mostly flat, it means the majority of these sales have come from either organic app store traffic or word of mouth.<p>My strategy so far has consisted of emailing bloggers in the space to try to get them to review the app and trying to participate in relevant forums/discussions, but this hasn't gotten me much response or attention.<p>I've also done some targeted facebook mobile advertising, but I haven't seen a reasonable ROI. My click through rates are decent (2-3%), but install rates are extremely low (1% at most).<p>I don't have a lot of cash to spend, but I do have a small budget for advertising if I can find an approach that's +EV, and I'm willing to share a significant portion of revenues with a partner (either an individual or organization) who can help. I don't think this app is going to make millions, but I do believe that it's a solid app that offers good value to a decent-sized niche and that there's a good potential revenue stream there if it can get enough exposure to get the ball rolling.<p>So, any thoughts on how to find marketing help?",1366629782

So just before/just after a woman will start to suspect she's pregnant, there's an brain actively processing information in her womb. If we took that as the standard, you know, that'd be more conservative than any religious grouping even asks for.<p>(the reason for this is that a human foetus ""is not human"". Our DNA is only human in that it contains a set of instructions that will transform an ape foetus into a human foetus. But the ape foetus isn't grown from scratch either, it's grown from some four legged animal. Basically the first recognizable animal you start out as is a bilobite (which is extinct, it's essentially a hollow ball of cells), grow into a trilobite (a 2-part ball of cells), grow into something that looks a lot like a tadpole, grow into ... and a tadpole requires a functioning brain, and so a human foetus at that development stage has a functioning brain)<p>The point is we don't protect life at all. We protect ways to make the life of the decision makers (which are nearly all adult humans) easier/more enjoyable. Kids, dogs and abortion are merely parts of that, as is freely killing dogs, intelligent or otherwise. Really the reason we don't kill kids is because humans would rebel. You can try to explain the problem, like stating that a kid, even a small one represents a massive investment of time, money, sweat, and (I'm sure any mother will be glad to remind you) inconvenience and pain, and I'm sure that's a rather good explanation. But in the end it comes down to adult, mostly male, humans vetoing it. We support abortion because it's a way to vastly limit that investment and get rid of both ""the product"" and the investment (and, frankly, because without abortion anything remotely resembling today's nightlife would be completely out of the question).<p>So really ""us humans"" don't rule the world. Too bad, not really. A small number of adult, mostly but not all male humans rule the world.",1366629599

saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may
know him.<p>19:23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;
seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.<p>19:24 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I
will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth
good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.<p>19:25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his

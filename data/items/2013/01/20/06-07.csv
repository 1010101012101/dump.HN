5086248,comment,5084925,5086210,2,0,rayiner,,,"Sure, but in my experience, engineers usually have the opposite problem. They're perfectly average looking white guys, but can't project the confidence that is necessary to be successful in the bar scene (or the similar situations). Online dating is a great format for people like that (assuming their personality is good--there is no helping the hopeless).<p>Also, let's face it, not every woman is out on the bar scene. There are plenty of women who find that social situation to be awkward and prefer the less intense world of online dating. I think if you're not naturally charismatic, going with the CW and trying to work the bar scene is a losing proposition. You're competing on a battlefield that doesn't play to your strengths while trying to meet the women who are least likely to overlook that aspect of your personality.",1358665168

So, when I sort them out, one look at the laundry basket, it's so obvious which sock pairs with which, that no thinking or inspecting is required.<p>For reference, these are good socks in my book: <a href=""http://www.happysocks.com/uk/combed-cotton-polka-stripe-14.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.happysocks.com/uk/combed-cotton-polka-stripe-14.h...</a><p>The advantage of having such socks is that, since I normally only wear black, it make me seem slightly less boring. \nThe disadvantage is that it's hard to find really worthwhile socks. The secrets of the trade are:<p>1. Always be alert. If you pass by a sock shop, go in. I once did it on a first date.<p>2. If you see socks you like, buy them. Don't say ""I'll come back later"" or ""I'll find them online"". You'll soon realise it's a buy-now-or-get-heartbroken affair.<p>3.the Internet is your friend. Compile a list of brands who are more likely to produce good socks and online shops who sell them.<p>3.5 Pro tip: Swedish brands are very colourful-sock friendly.<p>4. Visit those online shops regularly to see if they have anything worth buying.<p>5. You can never have enough socks, so if you see qualifying socks, buy them. You can always store them and use them at a later date.<p>6. Never buy more than one pair of the same design. The only exception is if there is a pair you see you exceptionally like, in which case you can buy two pairs, but store one pair to when the first pair is too worn out to wear.<p>Edit: formatting.<p>Edit 2: this obviously also solves the problem of having to throw good socks out as their general population get worn out.",1358663120

5086178,comment,5084401,5084401,18,0,olefoo,,,"It may be unfair to single out Ms. Ortiz, she is after all only one of many federal prosecutors; but reforming the american justice system is an urgent priority, and we must start somewhere. A society where justice is widely perceived to be available only to the most powerful and well-connected is one that is primed to fall prey to any number of severe and most likely violent pathologies.<p>The legitimacy of the legal system is the result of centuries of work by jurists, judges, legal scholars, politicians and others; each of whom added their effort to making it so that not only they believed the law had dealt fairly with those who came before it but also that it had appeared to be fair to the rest of society. When that legitimacy is eroded, for personal benefit, for career aspirations, to please those whose favor is sought, for any reason; it takes much less effort. But the damage is subtle, people give lip service to institutions long after they have become hollow shells of their former glory.<p>In this country, at this time; the law is an instrument of social control, of thievery ( read the literature on civil forfeiture, if that statement bothers you ), of vengeance, and only rarely and incidentally of justice. Most of us know this. But it is one of the truths that cannot be spoken in polite society.<p>At this time, most of us know but are unwilling to acknowledge, that the law is an outrageously powerful instrument that acts randomly and capriciously. If you happen to be of the wrong color, speak the wrong language, or practice the wrong religion in the wrong place at the wrong time; you can be given a status equivalent to Orwell's formulation of an 'unperson'. If you happen to cross the path of someone who has access to the controls of this fearsome legal apparatus, your guilt or innocence, your rightness or wrongness; is irrelevant. All that matters is whether they decide to take an interest in your case; if you are deemed a target, all that matters is what crime can be made to fit your situation.<p>It would seem axiomatic, that this is an untenable situation; that once this state obtains, it will not be long before the law becomes a disreputable joke, a sad reminder of former greatness, and a jungle in which everyone is a predator and fears becoming prey.<p>That is why the reform of our justice system is such an urgent matter. We have eroded the legitimacy of our courts to a degree that their proclaimed fairness is a dismal jest to anyone who has been in prolonged contact with them.<p>We have allowed our legal system to be infected with concepts  of intrinsic guilt, of theft under color of law, of monarchical privilege, of illegal truths; all of which are antithetical to a functional and free society.",1358662114

It would be absolutely insane to even suggest the idea that this could even approach a valid metric.<p>Nope, the author simply made use of external non-Python libraries that are the results of probably hundreds of thousands of lines of code and many man-years of work.

We have been working with an outsourced developer for a bit of time now and he has been very involved in the business and has been acting as an advisor.\nDue to the three of us thinking he would be a good fit on the team  and wanting to get more code pushed quickly, we have offered him the  option to join us as a cofounder. He is much more senior than us and  adds a lot of credibility to the team, and he has many connections that  have proven useful many times. He was the CTO of another startup years ago and has been advising many other companies since then while coding.  He has agreed to join us but we are having a bit of difficulty on the  terms of it.\nHe would like 24% of the company vested over two years with a six  month cliff, and he would work around 30 hours a week or more probably on  it. (The three of us are vested over 4 years with a one year cliff and  are fulltime and own equal amounts of the company) He would have to work  on other projects, however, since he has a lot of debt to pay (kids in college, mortgage, medical bills, etc). Basically, he wants 1%/month for  the next two years and he is pretty set on that. I would much rather have him vest over three years at the least, and some investor friends of mine have agreed with this. They think an investor would want him to vest a bit longer to ensure he stays. We were thinking of maybe doing a deferred salary contract to get him to agree  to three years and 20% once we are able to raise a seed round. At the moment we don't have the type of cash to pay him his market rates and we can only give him equity and the promise of a small deferred salary/incentive bonus later on. Once we raise a seed round we could pay him a small salary and he could work more on this.\nHow should I continue the discussion with him and is what he is asking for fair to us and him? Will this cause headaches down the road?",1358661766

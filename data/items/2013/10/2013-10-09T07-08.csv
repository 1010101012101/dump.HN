I said it before but I think it&#x27;s a superb platform for musicians and listeners alike.<p>iTunes / Apple takes the curated approach with their catalogue, they obviously don&#x27;t want you there unless you&#x27;re signed to a label. That is fine - let&#x27;s not act as if iTunes is the holy grail of music distribution - I&#x27;d argue that if you aren&#x27;t big enough to get into iTunes without another middle men you&#x27;re very unlikely to make any sales there either - especially as a small indie artists. It caters to casual listeners of popular music.<p>Bandcamp on the other hand is for enthusiasts actively seeking for obscure music. Depending on your audience you might be a lot better served there.",1381305531

Even moderate revenue matters - not only because moderate expenses have to be paid, but because &quot;generating revenue&quot; as a mindset needs to be cultivated and honed.  It&#x27;s an ethic that few have truly mastered, and one that truly defines an entrepreneur.  Generate revenue as a habit.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a balance to be had between doing things that generate revenue now and doing things that matter in the longer run ... but guess what ... that is exactly the nature of every business out there.  From the biggest multinationals to the smallest corner shop - they&#x27;re all balancing between generating shorter term revenues with longer term growth.<p>If you are spending time only doing long run  (&quot;strategic&quot;) stuff, you are not a business.

There are a few very limited/half baked implementations, but nothing &quot;canonical&quot; (and nothing so thoroughly researched, optimized and used).<p>BTW, part of the reason is that the world&#x27;s leading low-level concurrency researchers and implementers (Doug Lea, Nir Shavit and others) do most of their work in Java (most of my own work is designing non-blocking data structures, BTW; not that I&#x27;m comparing myself to Lea or Shavit in any way).<p>To get a sense for the quality of Java data structure implementations, I strongly suggest you watch this talk by Doug Lea: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro</a><p>His work is incredible.

A credit card indicates more serious buy-in (they&#x27;ve gotten payment approval already) and they&#x27;re more mentally invested in giving the product a real try before the end of the trial. And, as I said before, if you have an expensive onboarding process, taking on more customers than you can handle onboarding just means you lose them when you can&#x27;t properly serve them. Better to have fewer highly satisfied customers per day/week/month than lots of trials that never end up paying.<p>You can&#x27;t boil everything down to a rule that applies to all businesses. Taking a credit card doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s a forced continuity scam happening as that post seems to imply.

Neither PGP nor S/MIME can prevent adversary from collecting envelope information in emails, and unability to do this is what made Lavabit impossible to continue.<p>>>> mathematics are not subject to the choices that human beings make,<p>You seem to be either genuinely confused about how email works and what running a secure email server involves, or trying to say something else than you&#x27;re actually saying, or not making any sense.

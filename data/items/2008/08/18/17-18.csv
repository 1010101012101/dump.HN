You don't need an IDE for that.  The same is true for other IDE features you mentioned.  I don't need all that stuff integrated into a single monolithic application to be able to use them effectively.<p>> To me the author is incorrect in essentially arguing that people don't use IDEs with Ruby because they're too limiting<p>They're too limiting <i>for Ruby</i>.<p>> IDEs for Ruby aren't good enough to make it worthwhile to deal with those limitations<p>More accurately, what an IDE provides over the tools people tend to use with Ruby isn't enough to offset the limitations, because what an IDE provides is for the most part <i>superfluous</i> for Ruby, and the IDE way of approaching programming isn't very compatible with the characteristics of the language that <i>make</i> common IDE ""benefits"" superfluous.<p>It seems our main point of disagreement is something like this:<p>1. You think the fact Ruby doesn't have good IDEs is that it's designed in a way that prevents it from benefiting from them, because it just wasn't planned out well enough to take advantage of IDEs.  As a result, Ruby will always lack the benefits of IDEs.<p>2. I think the fact Ruby doesn't have good IDEs is that it's designed in a way that ensures it doesn't <i>need</i> IDEs, and IDE functionality wouldn't really be a benefit because it's superfluous to a language like Ruby.  As a result, Ruby will never need the benefits of IDEs.  Instead, it's more geared to taking advantage of the benefits of powerful text processing applications like Vim and Emacs.",1219080844

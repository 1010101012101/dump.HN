A huge problem I see in Microsoft&#x27;s approach is its ability to build a compelling platform for consumers, especially in a time of increasing skepticism in American tech. It&#x27;s technology might be great, but it&#x27;s cultural influence is low and may not be enough to keep it strong in the face of Chinese competitors in the future.

There&#x27;s no requirement for socialism to remove markets as mechanism to determine value.<p>There is a requirement to reject a market based on private ownership of the means of production as the means to determine the individuals return for work rendered, not to reject market mechanisms in general.<p>In a sense you are right that Marxists and &quot;Austrians&quot; could agree that &quot;intermediate&quot; socialist policies that hamper the functioning of the market are doomed to fail. But some Marxists will believe that this is because an actual Marxist implementation could have freed the market from the limitations of the halfway house of social democrats.<p>E.g. a problem with the social democratic model of Norway for example is exactly that the market is stymied by all kinds of regulations that are intended to cushion society from the effects of unrestrained capitalism. These clearly affect the ability of the markets to accurately price e.g. the actual cost of a product, because it ends up pricing in societal costs of dealing with labour issues unrelated to what this company actually does.<p>But these are necessary to achieve a socialist programme under the constraints of capitalist modes of ownership, not because of the market.<p>As a specific example, in Norway it is incredibly hard to make people redundant, and even normal notice periods are typicall 3 months. These protections were hard won successes of the labour movements. But they are there to safeguard employees in a system where long term unemployment is a risk leading to reduced earning ability - possibly for the rest of your life if you end up losing career progression.<p>Consider a socialist system where the cost of employment are effectively borne by society whether or not there is currently work for you, and where you&#x27;re <i>not</i> losing out on salary progression. In such a system you might want to strip most redundancy protections back to the bone, because they obscure the real costs of production <i>and</i> they obscure real unemployment.<p>By stripping such protections, society would be able to see what the free labour pool actually is, and take measures on that basis - whether it would be to lower working hours, or offer more vacations, or encourage more education, or offer up resources to people wanting to start new projects.<p>It is thus not the market that is a problem for Marxists, but a capitalist market under capitalist modes of ownership.<p>That does not mean all socialists, or all Marxists, want market economies, but there certainly are Marxists who see the market as by far the best means to calculate relative value exactly in order to direct activity fit for an industrial society. At least some Marxists and Austrians will in fact agree to levels of regulation in many areas that would cause &quot;intermediate&quot; socialists like social democrats to have strokes.",1446871025

The work that he has done will remain even now that his willingness to maintain these projects &#x27;for free&#x27; has waned.<p>It is the open source developer&#x27;s responsibility to fight for their own OSS/life balance, and it is good to see Ian taking this step to stand up for himself. Hopefully Ian&#x27;s transition away from his own self-admitted naïveté will go smoothly -- these projects will continue even when he chooses to ignore destructive input and/or give an outright &#x27;no&#x27; (or &#x27;not right now&#x27;) when necessary. Ian and other OSS maintainers do well to take a few pages from the lean startup customer support desk handbook: creating email templates, personal developer/contributor FAQs, etc. No doubt this blog post will serve its part as something Ian and others can point corporate developers to as a not-so-subtle hint in the future!<p>In my own very limited (and far less impressive) experience, I have found maintaining a list of alternative projects to be very helpful. Then, when someone brings an urgent need to my attention, I can point them to the list so they can solve their problem without me. One such conversation went like this:<p><pre><code>  >\n  > Hi ______,\n  >\n  > I will not be able to resolve these issues in what it sounds \n  > like is the timeframe you need.\n  >\n  > My recommendation would be that you install the trial version \n  > of a tool on the list of commercial alternatives: [url]\n  >\n  > One that I have very limited experience with is [url]. The page\n  > also lists all of the free tools that I am aware of.\n  >\n  > Thanks for reporting these problems; I will create issues to \n  > track the progress of resolving them.\n  >\n</code></pre>\nEdit: PS. Hopefully Ian will invest some time in sharing some of the details of his positive experiences in OSS, perhaps even in interactions with the corporate world. In addition to what not to do, examples of what has worked well could make it easier for others to request more of the same!

Not to mention that there are tools such as STM that let you deal with state in a much safer and less error-prone way.<p>Separating the state between multiple communicating services is basically the same strategy as OOP (objects that communicate via messages and encapsulate state) but with stronger encapsulation requirements (access only via API, you can&#x27;t just &quot;reuse&quot; methods willy-nilly all over the place but you have to come up with a sensible library or a third service, etc etc).<p>It works, yes but it works about just as much as OO does.

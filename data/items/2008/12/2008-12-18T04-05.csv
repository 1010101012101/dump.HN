I've looked at <i>many</i> signal and image processing books, and I prefer this one by far.  Almost all others seem to either shy away from math to the point of absurdity or revel in it to the point of forgetting the practical aspects.<p>Image processing is one of those fields where there is an incredible amount of stuff online, but it is so fragmented, its almost useless to someone who isn't already an expert.

401795,comment,401744,401744,0,0,sqs,,,"I really like Objective-C. I had been using mostly Ruby before I started Obj-C (to make a quick iPhone app), and I liked it so much that I ended up going even further and doing about half of my programming in C++. Obj-C was a nice introduction to using a compiled language in real code that did stuff (as opposed to CS homework, which was my only previous C experience). When I wanted to make real stuff (servers), though, Obj-C wouldn't work since it had few libraries and relied heavily (in practice) on Apple's implementation of NS* classes.<p>If you have programming experience, you should be able to learn 99% of Objective-C in about 5 hours.",1229573903

As well as Google Music and other services the user might expect.<p>This is true. This is one of the many hurdles they need to overcome to switch to another platform.<p>> When did this happen? Samsung is a huge partner of Android. They make 1 of 3 current Nexus devices and made the previous 2 Nexus phones (more than any other manufacturer). This is a completely unrelated thing.<p>It&#x27;s speculation really. The previous Nexus products were all made by Samsung. Why did Google suddenly start switching to other manufacturers? If Samsung made the best devices, why change?<p>If your company commands the most profits and market share of a platform - do you not want to use this as leverage to some degree? Better bargaining power gives you a competitive advantage over other players (LG, Asus, HTC, etc).<p>> Does Motorola count?

Here&#x27;s the right solution:<p>1) Keep the distinction between declaration and assignment. &#x27;var x = 1&#x27; introduces a new variable, &#x27;x = 1&#x27; changes an existing variable.<p>2) Remove globals from the language. &#x27;x = 1&#x27; becomes an error unless there&#x27;s a &#x27;var x&#x27; in scope.<p>3) Change &#x27;var&#x27; declarations so they apply to the containing {} block, not the whole containing function.<p>There&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t be much to discuss here, if not for historical accidents.

6116049,comment,6115088,6115439,4,0,vertex-four,,,"> If anything, I think this should be a wakeup call for those of us who have the capability to change things. I&#x27;m not talking about lobbying or raising attention to the issue, but the technical challenges of designing a network that is immune to all forms of surveillance.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this as the first step. The first step is decentralising the control of people&#x27;s identities.<p>This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean brand new protocols or ways of doing things. All that would be necessary as a first step would be a movement to set up a number of independent non-profits to provide basic Internet services; email, media sharing, chat, and Facebook-style &quot;wall&quot; systems being possibly the minimal viable subset.<p>Each non-profit could cover a defined geographical area; a small city or county, etc. This would allow them to target marketing and fund-raising locally, and prevent the problem of there being too much choice for consumers within this new ecosystem (possibly eventually ending up with a subset of organisations having the majority of the users).<p>The non-profits could link in with each other easily through an OpenID Connect based network, so that you can follow someone&#x27;s feeds just by entering your email address, even if they&#x27;re on another organisation&#x27;s system. Users who don&#x27;t have an account on this network could still follow users on the network, using email as a fallback delivery method.<p>The best bit? The technology to do this is mostly based on off-the-shelf systems and standards. Very little that&#x27;s entirely new has to be written, nobody has to change the way they use the Internet, and all of a sudden, it&#x27;d be much harder for a Government agency to coerce every single organisation into giving up keys, passwords, or automated user data access.<p>Once Governments have eventually figured it out, hopefully the movement will be in full swing and the people participating in it will be able to effectively develop and market a properly decentralised, cryptographic system that doesn&#x27;t depend on a network of authoritative nodes, if that becomes necessary and generally useful.",1375000299

Certainly doing long shifts in a major hospital often invovles:<p>1. An entirely unpredictable work load, with no mechanism to compensate for excessive demand.\n2. Dealing with problems for which you have not been properly trained.\n3. Dealing with other doctors that are also extremely busy and stressed, and therefore limited in how much they can help you.\n4. Having to work while physically and emotionally exhausted or actually genuinely sick, with no recourse to get help.\n5. Having to do all this while studying or taking exams.\n6. Not being paid fully for the hours you work.\n7. Sometimes being sworn at, racially vilified, spat at, threatened or attacked. Depending on which job you do, this could come from your colleagues, nursing staff, admin or the patients.<p>I think that certain other professions such as the police or military personnel encounter similar situations, but I would hazard that they are better trained, better supported and rostered better than doctors ever are. So although many other people might work 90+ weeks, I doubt it is under these conditions. Because that would be a dumb thing to do right? And only doctors with their misguided sense of duty and high pain tolerance are willing to front up again and again. Nurses can suffer the same problems, but in general they are much better at protecting themselves.",1374999894

6116030,comment,6112622,6112622,1,0,mistercow,,,">I have no way of knowing any of that for sure, though, since Ive never seen a 1000 Hz head-mounted display myself, and dont ever expect to.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure. On the first post in the sequence, someone had left a comment about DLP, which has extremely fast switching times. This was agreed to be impractical on the grounds that DMD pixels are either on or off and can only achieve intermediate levels via PWM (which takes enough time to do).<p>I initially didn&#x27;t think much about it, but it festered in my head for a few hours, and I started researching it a bit. I think it could actually work.<p>The thing is, our eyes are expecting continuous input, yes, but they don&#x27;t actually have the bandwidth to really pull in anywhere near a thousand 24 bit images every second. The problem is the quantization, not the actual amount of information. Obviously a DMD is not going to fix the spacial quantization, but I believe it <i>can</i> fix the quantization in time.<p>The DMD I was looking at can be switched by its controller at 2.9 kHz for arbitrary input, and 4.2 kHz for pre-loaded input. From what I can tell, there&#x27;s other overhead going on there, and it looks like you should be able to get it up to about 5.5kHz if you built a custom controller.<p>What I propose is to run the display at 5500 fps... at <i>1 bit per channel</i>. Hear me out!<p>If we set the threshold for detecting <i>small</i> variations in light at 200Hz (this is what is recommended for PWM dimming of LEDs, for example), then that gives us about 28 pulses to work with, within the eye&#x27;s tolerance. Now we have some options. Maybe the cost of DMDs goes way down in the next few years. In that case, we could stack them (increasing the new LEDs&#x27; intensities by powers of 2) and get exponentially more levels with each DMD. As it stands now, that would get expensive very quickly - with only one for each eye, the QVGA version of this is already at about $200.<p>Of course we do want colors, so we&#x27;d divide up our time between the RGB channels. Give, say, 6 levels to blue, 8 to red, and 14 to green.<p>So by using temporally dithered 1-bit frames, we should be able to get (as far as our eyes can tell) continuous motion (but still quantized to pixel boundaries). Now, thinking at the 5ms scale instead of the 200s scale, we should be able to do more dithering. You&#x27;d be surprised at how much you can get away with even with purely spatial dithering with only 6.5 bits per pixel if you divide those bits up right.<p>Edit: I realized I got mixed up between my modes of thinking. The controller doesn&#x27;t drive the DMD full speed because it leaves gaps between each channel. When I worked out that 5.5 kHz figure, I was still thinking of at least one DMD per channel. So you get even fewer colors than I thought.<p>One thing I forgot to mention though, is that as far as I can tell from these data sheets, the bottleneck by far is bandwidth. Having studied it for a while, I&#x27;m not entirely sure that we don&#x27;t already have the technology to build a single-DMD full color 1kHz DLP. There is however no doubt that you could build a full color 1kHz DLP using multiple DMDs. I&#x27;m just not sure it would fit in an HMD.",1374999596

Flat UI means a smaller visual vocabulary (usually, and maybe not the best chhoice of word but hopefully you know what I&#x27;m trying to get at), but it also means fewer clues for users. Once they&#x27;ve figured out the answer to &quot;what is a button?&quot; they&#x27;re left with something free of visual noise that is mostly only useful while learning.<p>(Anecdotally) For someone non technical, change is usually bad when it comes to interfaces. I think that simple and &quot;easy to understand&quot; is a great direction and have tried using flat and &quot;ios7 color&font weight differentiated buttons&quot; in some recent projects. I have seen teething issues when moving towards UIs where the visual definition of a button does not include some &quot;quasi-3d&quot; aspect. Simply differentiating by text or background color makes a lot of users apprehensive about touching things, afraid they will produce an unexpected or unwanted result. I&#x27;ve seen them adapt rather quickly, but there has always been some &#x27;what do I press?&#x27; stage. Not exactly test data, but the results have been pretty consistent.<p>EDIT: I should note that usually adding  a stroke to just the bottom edge of a clickable button or a slight shadow/gradient usually helps. You can see this style in a lot of recent google products and I think it works really well (and I bet they tested it before deploying!). This method allows you to remove or tone down the shadows/gradients/textures from your navbars and other items without having them feel disconnected from your buttons.",1374999308

For about 6 months, there was an audio bug in IOS (that now seems to be fixed).  If I plugged in my iPhone to a car charger/music player, and removed it while a song was playing, the audio would switch off.\nNow Apple, being a hip company, had about 6 volume settings, of which you can&#x27;t see the settings for most of these volume settings.  The volumes I know of are :-\n1) the volume level through the headphones\n2) the volume through the speaker, when the audio is switched on by a physical switch\n3) the volume through the speaker, when the audio is switched off by a physical switch\n4) the volume through the headphones when the phone is plugged in through a 30 pin connector\n5) an application specific volume (eg. playing a movie through a web browser - which does NOT use volumes 1-5)\n6) ring-tone volume<p>Now, for some reason, Apple got the volumes mixed up so that it was IMPOSSIBLE to get any sound (except 6.) without plugging in a 30 pin connector and increasing the volume.<p>It took me MONTHS to work this out.  All of the Apple &quot;experts&quot; I knew swore that this was not possible until I showed them.  Even Apple said there was no bug and that it was faulty hardware, which I knew it wasn&#x27;t.<p>The problem is that I keep on having similar issues with IOS.  It&#x27;s just &quot;too clever&quot; for its own good.  Settings that you need are just not there (eg. accessing WIFI settings with a single click or slide).<p>There was also the time that iTunes REFUSED to copy music to my iPhone.  If I used a 3rd party tool, songs would be copied and could play, but as soon as I used iTunes, it knew the new songs were &quot;corrupted&quot;, and put the broken versions of the music on my phone.  Thankfully, this bug only lasted a week.<p>I also find my iPhone 4s laggy.  As an example, if I load a web page in the background, and try to scroll the current web page, the phone locks up for about 1000 milliseconds (ie. a VERY long time).  It really infuriates me.<p>As for the Android lag, I am not sure what people are referring to.  the Google hardware has not been a problem that I have seen - ever.<p>I think the best summary I can think of is that IOS is for people that <i>don&#x27;t</i> want choice (eg. no FLAC, no 1080p MKV, no volume settings, you can&#x27;t copy music files directly - you need iTunes, etc).  Android has more that you need to know about, but at least you CAN find it if you want to.<p>I have a love/hate with IOS.  But, when IOS pisses me off, it REALLY pisses me off.  I can&#x27;t say the same for Android.<p>You can see that I like choice.\nI also agree with others that I&#x27;d rather see Apple do well than Samsung.  Samsung have a highly unethical history.  If it weren&#x27;t for Apple, Samsung would still be churning out rubbish handsets.",1374998954

(Or, of course, different readers, or a different mental model of what his readers care about, or something, but whatever it is it seems to produce similar results to integrity.)",1251107730
781833,comment,781182,781182,0,0,hristov,,,"So Ken Rockwell was essentially stealing tax dollars. I am sure that happened and still happens a lot. It has nothing to do with the supposed lazyness of the american worker or anything like that -- it has to do with the idiotic cost plus basis the government uses for military projects. This means that the higher the cost the higher the profit. The more hours billed the higher the profit. SO his managers make sure they overlook his slacking as long as there is government money coming in and he keeps sending those timeslips in.<p>If cost plus accounting is removed and the military actually did projects based on competitive bidding and if the government made them stick to those bids, then you would see that most of the companies Ken worked for would not allow that type of slacking.<p>So yeah it sure it happens a lot, but at least you'd expect most people to feel slightly guilty about it. Ken, on the other hand, feels proud.<p>BTW I have some friends that are engineers in the defense industry and most of them work pretty hard, so i am not sure his rule applies for most of the defense industry even.",1251107716

Conversely, they're slow to adapt to changing requirements and that is why if you wish to do clever stuff with a minimum of verbosity you find yourself on the bleeding edge of language development.<p>It's a price you are either willing to pay, or you'll be finding yourself writing a lot of code in a language that was not well geared towards the age of the internet.<p>PHP, Ruby, Python, Scala and even Java are under active development so you will have to make choices about which version you are going to stick to for the time being.",1251107661

781828,comment,777603,781597,0,0,theblackbox,,,"I think my point is often overlooked. I'm not denying that there exists sustainable economic models for the ""legal drugs trade"", such as tobacco and alcohol, nor am I forgetting this in my hyperbolic critique of the <i>legalisation</i> of the ""illicit drugs trade"". What I'm saying is simply a matter of scale. Look at the illicit drugs trade as it currently stands, valued at billions if not trillions of monies, dispite the effect of <i>very</i> agressive lobbying on behalf of the worlds governments, police and military institutions. If this pressure were to let up, even in only a few of these countries, this would surely cause an economic vacuum that would be for all intents and purposes like a gold rush(?). What I'm saying is that there effectively exists a non-partisan international agreement to actively surpress the emergence of the free (as in speech) drugs trade. Coffee is already the second largest comodity in the world, it's not that far a stretch of the imagination to picture Meth or Cocaine supplanting the humble bean as our stimulant of choice were they to be part of a legal industry.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm well aware of the rhetorical/polemic structure of this argument, as well as the simple age of it, I'm just chipping in with what I've considered. I myself have a very liberal approach to drugs, my use of certain drugs (which is moderate even for alcohol) and I have a family involved in Iraq/AfPaq, figured this thread was well suited to my two cents. Just thought I had to defend my comments as something more than simply a ""ohhh, terrorist'll get ya"" pokey stick.",1251107276

Humans can stand tall and can see over greater areas than say dogs, and keep better watch for threats, opportunities and escape routes.<p>Because of our brains and hands, we can cultivate and domesticate (observing seasons) so as to prepare and store food in advance for easier survival and longevity, giving us time to think about other things and move beyond subsistence. We can also move between great temperatures zones by using clothes.<p>We can also navigate with the aid of maps and use fire to cook so that meat is easier to digest, thus being able to have a multi-use digestive tracts. This means having a greater nutritional range so that a more complex organism can evolve and giving us access to a greater array of possible food.<p>Domesticating dogs meant we could sleep for longer periods while the dogs could warn us of wild animals or scare them off: good for REM whilst travelling over long distances and thus unable to build fences.",1251106944

In fact, they will even write GCC <i>version</i> dependent code, to the tune of ""this will not compile correctly with GCC 4.x.x, you will need to use 2.95.26.2.3.5.1""<p>And given that the complaint was specifically levelled against Ruby, for the most part, it seems to be making one specific point:<p>If your language is specified by the existence of a single reference implementation, and you keep changing that reference implementation, then that's equivalent to the <i>language</i> continually changing, which is a fair criticism, I think, particularly when it breaks backwards compatibility or continually deprecates features used in production code (requiring an endless cycle of rewrites, or maintenance of some older branch of the implementation).  This sort of behaviour would certainly strike me as ""annoying"", but that's essentially what you get when you commit yourself to using a product which makes no attempts to standardise, and which lacks large commercial customers who would place pressure on the software vendor to keep backwards-compatibility as a priority.",1251106428

5029267,comment,5021483,5022443,1,0,to3m,,,"NSArray has a constant-time size query, so you might as well do ""[x count]==0"". If you had a linked list type structure, though, you might just have next/prev pointers in your list object, making a size query an O(N) operation. (The C++ STL provides an ""empty()"" function in its containers for presumably this reason. It has some containers that have to be implemented as linked lists or trees, meaning there's the possibility that ""x.empty()"" to be much more efficient than ""x.size()==0"". Not sure how often implementations take advantage of this, mind.)<p>As for how you'd use it, I've pretty much always used it for early outs:<p><pre><code>    if(items.empty()) return NULL;\n    return &items[items.size()%rand()];\n</code></pre>\nor for filling in caches:<p><pre><code>    if(items.empty()) return NULL;\n\n    if(cache.empty()) { /* fill cache */ }\n\n    assert(cache[index].underlying_item==items[index]);\n    return cache[index].some_other_data;\n</code></pre>\nSo it always ends up being tested positively.

In this situation, you have a left lane congested with people waiting to go on the busy road, and a right lane that should be almost free flowing. By most understandings (including the execellent book, Traffic) people wanting to go to the busy road should wait in line in the left lane, allowing people going to the less busy road to pass freely.

Made a genius bar reservation, showed up at an Apple Store, waited 30 minutes, then was told it'd be $300 for a replacement iPad of the same type.  A few internet discussions said I might be able to get a replacement iPad for free, but the only free replacements seemed to be reported by women.  So I took the deal and paid $50 extra for better support.<p>The replacement iPad was flaky right off the bat -- flickering screen even with auto-brightness off.  I returned it to a local Apple Store and waited while the 2nd replacement was being charged.  After 45 minutes of waiting, the genius helping me finally agreed that something was wrong.<p>Unfortunately, there were no other iPad 3's in the store.  I asked if I could just get any iPad they had in the store. The genius told me the Apple system didn't even allow them to change the replacement iPad model.  Think about that.  Apple built a system that makes it impossible for the people on the ground to do right by a customer.<p>I waited another 15 minutes for the manager, and then she came and explained my options.  I could drive to other Apple stores and pickup an iPad.  Or I could wait until that store got a new shipment and come back in.  She agreed with the genius that I couldn't get another iPad in the store.  Basically, all my options, even with a valid Apple care replacement service contract, was to spend more of my time and effort due to two bad replacement iPads.  I told her I'd agree to have the iPad shipped to me.<p>I'm pretty sure if I went to an Apple store a few years ago (and certainly 5 years ago), I'd be walking out with an iPad even if the manager had to ""upgrade"" me to whatever they were selling at the time.  Now, it's about rules, not about making the customer happy.  Welcome to the new Apple as they try to wring the last dollar from your hand.

This means that companies are constantly trying to out do each other, and those that are the most expensive and provide the worst service go out of business. Yet in the content industry, the big corporations are the most expensive, and provide the worse service. And we're not just talking about a bad service, we're talking so appallingly bad that they deliberately set out to make the product crap (like I said, DRM, anti-piracy ads, etc).

5029076,comment,5028545,5028867,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Not all ventures necessarily produce tangible products for everyone who might be interested in financing them. For example, I am not a coffee drinker but there was a very interesting kickstarter for an espresso maker (zpm espresso) that I made note of. The people behind it seemed to know what they were about and seemed to have an interesting and novel idea with a lot of potential. For me it would have been a good investment potential, but that wasn't an option. Similarly, someone might come up with a great new idea on how to manufacture carbon composites or build satellites and want crowd funding to help get it off the ground, but they will have more trouble using kickstarter and such-like because they can't deliver the fruits of their project to their supporters the way other projects could.<p>In some ways this is fine, and I think that kickstarter is and should be as much about helping to bring something to fruition as it is about buying things that don't exist yet. However, it is limiting, and it would be very beneficial to many projects if they could provide equity in a venture in exchange for funding.<p>Congress has passed a law which should enable just that, in a limited way, and time will tell how successful such things become.",1357686133

His argument was that every minute you are late you're incurring many times that many minutes in cost because folks are waiting on you.<p>I found it remarkably effective. It had the unexpected effect of making meetings end on time as well since folks would not be late for their next meeting.

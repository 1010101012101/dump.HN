7581173,comment,7580722,7580722,1,0,vayarajesh,,,"very true, specially in the field of web-design. If you browse the latest 10 pages of themeforest.net templates you will find all similar designs (infact exactly what you mentioned in your article in a detail manner :) )<p>Since the comeback of flat design everybody is becoming a designer because all they need to do is put big pictures and 1 or 2 colors and bordered boxes and vola! you are a designer",1397393863
7581172,comment,7580722,7581054,2,0,Silhouette,,,"It&#x27;s not just Bootstrap, though, is it? It&#x27;s also flat design, similar colour palettes, similar fonts, using one big hero image or some sort of carousel, and numerous other details.<p>And the real kicker is that <i>most of these aren&#x27;t done well</i>.<p>Aside from having a very limited expressive range, flat design has all kinds of usability problems that plenty of people have called out from the start. The fact that both Microsoft and Apple have chosen to adopt flat design does not change that unfortunate reality.<p>I cringe a little every time I see a web site using Proxima Nova, a font which renders <i>horribly</i> at many sizes and in many browsers, whatever all the renting-you-fonts-for-money services will tell you about how optimised their fonts are. I wince even more when I have to use a site with trendy thin fonts that are so hard to read under many conditions that I have to start hacking the CSS around to make it more comfortable. At least there is a small silver lining here: Helvetica is less common in font stacks now, so everyone on Windows who has printer fonts installed can breathe a sigh of relief.<p>Carousels have problems that are well known to anyone who studies usability, yet people persist in using them, presumably because they care more about looking cool in a demo than having a site that is actually effective. Or they just don&#x27;t know any better, because they don&#x27;t know anything about usability, and anyway they feel compelled to use at least 98% of what&#x27;s in their template on every project. After all, the only acceptable alternative is to use a hero image that automatically scales to full page width, thus reducing modern, good quality, high resolution monitors to displaying heavily pixellated versions of clip art that is probably irrelevant anyway, and obviously no designer would do something silly like that.<p>It&#x27;s not the consolidation and uniformity that bothers me. It&#x27;s consistently doing things that just <i>aren&#x27;t very good</i> that I find frustrating.",1397393817

The fact is that cheap, mass-produced products have a large market that is willing to pay for them.<p>If you can make such products with less time and money than you would need to create original, thoughtful, customised work for every job, then you have a viable business model. Moreover, your business model can be implemented by people who don&#x27;t have the skill and creativity required to do bespoke work.<p>Fortunately, there will always be a market for premium sites, with original designs that are carefully planned with the site&#x27;s goals in mind, and with a look and feel that are matched to the client&#x27;s brand. There will always be clients who need a completely custom web app to fit their particular needs. And these kinds of client will always be willing to pay a premium for good work.<p>For better or worse, there are simply a lot more clients who don&#x27;t have that kind of budget, and for whom a site that is built from a decent template with a basic CMS in half a day does the job well enough. And there are even more who don&#x27;t want a template that is exactly like everyone else, but can settle for the work of a newbie web developer who doesn&#x27;t know much but can manage to fire up Yeoman and throw together some HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap and a couple of jQuery plug-ins.",1397392609

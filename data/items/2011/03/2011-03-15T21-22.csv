My gf is an ICU nurse here and is constantly telling me how averse to technological change everyone in the hospital is.  Nurses and doctors have even quit when the hospital has implemented new software in the past.  In addition, a lot of people are jumping on the healthcare bandwagon right now.  Lots of great ideas out there, but I'm skeptical that a new system will be taking off on a large scale anytime soon.<p>Just my two cents, but best of luck to all the startups trying to shake up that industry.",1300226351

2329613,comment,2327584,2327997,0,0,akkartik,,,"<i>""As a maintenance programmer, it seems like I'd have to learn a whole new language with each program I have to maintain.""</i><p>I used to think the same thing. But I'm starting to realize that you have to make some assumption about what tools future readers of your code have at their disposal, and that these assumptions change the cost and overhead of abstractions.<p>Here's a degenerate example. We all know that where you draw your function boundaries hugely impacts readability. You don't want one single function for your entire program, and you don't want every function being one-liners either. There tends to be a sweet spot that takes into account how often a code fragment is needed before extracting it into its own function. But if you take into account that a java programmer reading it in his IDE can jump to the call with a keystroke, that tends to move the sweet spot downward. Now I need less reuse to justify method extraction.<p>A less degenerate example: ruby has monkey-patching, where you can change a function or class's behavior without touching the file where it's defined. This tends to be viewed as a bad thing because now it difficult to visualize a function's b does. But I'm starting to realize this depends on how hard it is to search for the function. It's painful when you have a load path and have to search multiple disjoint directory trees for a monkey-patch. But it would be fine if everything's in a single flat directory.<p>I've been working on an arc-like language, and I find I can be extremely promiscuous with my monkey-patching extensions because the language implementation is designed from the ground up to live in the same directory as your app, and finding monkey-patches takes just a simple grep. (Hopefully it's not just that it's just me hacking on it.)<p>Here's my implementation: <a href=""http://github.com/akkartik/wart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/akkartik/wart</a>",1300226315

Although you can get the most cutting edge medical treatment in terms of surgical procedures and CT scanners - storing and communicating most types of data is archaic. It's primarily because most physicians and hospitals do not see how moving to an electronic medical records system helps their bottom line, with the exception of electronic prescriptions, which can reduce errors that result in death.<p>It's actually sad that we need a stimulus to do all this. We really shouldn't. If there are more and more providers offering services at a competitive rate, doctors and hospitals would more readily switch over. Right now AllScript is charging close to $700 a month at our hospital (that's the discounted rate btw) to use their EMR system. With the understanding that one would get the 44K grant from the government. 
That's an absurd amount to charge for any such system. I'm not familiar with what DrChrono is offering, but at least their price point is reasonable and if there were other providers in the price range as well, docs and hospitals would switch without the need for a stimulus.<p>Our own office went electronic before there ever was such a thing as a stimulus.

And our prayers are with the quake survivors in Japan and the responders who are working to contain the problem during this horrible disaster.<p>Any model of nuclear power reliability would have a high degree of uncertainty (due to intractability) and would need to account for arbitrary faults in design, siting, construction, operation, and monitoring. In CS there's a concept of ""byzantine fault tolerance"" where every processor in a network can fail in arbitrary ways.<p>The minimum reliability rate predicted by the safety model would need to be on the order of 1-10^-8 to have assurance that major catastrophic events would not be likely to occur within some reasonable time span.<p>How much confidence can you have that a model is consistent with reality to within 8 or 9 decimal places in order to overcome the minimum acceptable reliability level? We cannot come close to this in a complex, realistic system analysis. This is not like other problems we normally encounter, where the minimum acceptable reliability to prevent an immediate global catastrophe is orders of magnitude lower.<p>Due to high model uncertainty and low acceptable failure rate, it is difficult in principle to come up with a convincing pro-nuclear argument whose lower interval didn't have a high expected death rate.<p>In this case, the heroism of the emergency responders was the difference between an immediate catastrophe and the current situation. Logistical problems and equipment failures impeded the response. Had the delays been exacerbated or had there been other complications (such as aftershocks that weakened the system), it's easy to see the delays could've been extended to the point where intervention wouldn't have been as effective.<p>Solar thermal power generation and wind are safe alternatives that can provide all 474 exajoules of earth's global energy demand. It's cheaper than the alternatives when externalities are properly accounted for and the initial investment would be a reasonable fraction of global GDP (certainly much less than the global financial crisis cost and it would actually stimulate the economy). Technology is ready. However, there are primarily sociological hurdles now (how do we get powerful polluters to change course?)<p>Why should anyone have to die for electricity?

In my opinion, this is the easiest type of meditation to start with. There are sites for these 10-day course pretty much everywhere around the world. The course runs on a donation basis: you are fed and housed for free during the duration of the course and at the end you choose whether to donate or not.<p>I met a lot of very nice people in my course. Some were new (like myself) but some were experienced veterans (a couple of guys had been practicing for over 15 years) and everyone seemed so happy. The course is very difficult, both physically (you need to sit on the floor for at least 9 hours a day, and believe me you will only realize just how bad/painful this can be once you do it) and mentally (you are not allowed to talk at all during the duration of the course). But it was all more than worth it at the end.<p>During the actual course I became more at peace with myself and gained some important insights on my personality and some of the roots of my misery. There's a lot of philosophy behind the actual technique but the basic idea is that you are taught to be indifferent to sub-conscious sensations of 'good' and 'bad'. By no reacting to 'good' sensations, you  limit your craving and hence your misery. Similarly, if you do not react to 'bad' sensations you can keep your cool, not get distracted and just be happier.<p>I am definitely very happy I was exposed to this technique at a young stage of my life. Even though I haven't been practicing since I took the course I am determined to make Vipassana a part of my every day life.",1300224211

Not many APIs allow to ""crawl"" the data, even though one of the four guiding principles for interface is:

If we intend to use reprocessing to conserve uranium, then we need to come up with new reactor designs that require less fossil fuel energy and less money to build.<p>The problem isn't that reactors are inherently unsafe, but that building new reactors without dramatically improving the underlying designs is inherently inefficient.  This means that nuclear energy, when all insurance and other costs are included, does not present ANY savings over any other form of newly-built power plant.<p>The main cost argument in favor of nuclear power is that existing thirty-year old plants cost so little per year.  This is an obvious diversionary trick.  We paid off the bonds ages ago.  My house is also the cheapest on the street if you don't include the mortgage.<p>The main argument in favor of nuclear power is that it provides reliable baseload energy, which must only be shut down once every fourteen months or so for refueling.  This disaster is the proof that nuclear baseload energy is only as reliable as its safety investments and contigency planning.  Fukushima is not the first plant to go silent forever.<p>The Fukushima disaster reminds me of what really happened to our I-35W bridge locally.  Over thirty years ago, someone built bridge with gussets too thin.  Over a decade ago, our state replaced its government bridge inspectors with a for-profit firm that promised it would ""save money"" through efficiency savings on labor.  Seven years before the disaster, HNTB Corp. of Kansas City performed a bridge analysis to try to win the contract from URS.  They found the under-sized gussets and demonstrated how the Minnesota Department of Transportation could use ""supplemental plates"" and a new ""oversize gusset"" to strengthen the bridge.  HNTB never got the contract and improvements were never made.  Later, URS had the option to either re-inspect the bridge or to brace the bridge as HNTB had suggested.  They chose to re-inspect.<p>During court filings in the victims lawsuit, a URS bridge contractor stated in an internal e-mail that they chose not to determine the stresses on all the components in the bridge because ""it was too much work.""<p>The moral of the story is that saving money on engineering does not always save money.

We feel that many books (almost all non-fiction books, some fiction books) should be self-published as ebooks as the author is writing them, before any publisher is involved.  This way, authors get better feedback from their readers, and they can evolve their book with useful feedback.<p>For book authors, no simple mechanism for publishing in-progress versions of a book has existed, except for the beta book and early access programs offered by the best technical book publishers.<p>Currently we're focusing on two types of target authors:
1. technical book authors who want to self-publish their next technical book
2. bloggers who want to make books out of a curated and edited subset of their blog content<p>We support writing in HTML and Markdown: HTML is good for bloggers, Markdown is good for technical book authors.  We also support external code samples for Markdown books with a simple syntax.<p>In both cases, authors edit their books on their own computers, in a folder that we automatically create and share with them via Dropbox.  To produce a new preview or published version, authors just click a button on leanpub.com.<p>We recently pivoted to using Dropbox for all books, instead of our previous two approaches of supporting an in-browser book editor (it sucked) and Git integration (it was elitist).<p>We finally feel that we have a coherent product.

Generally a meltdown is as I described it; where the situation is unrecoverable with the standard cooling and you are facing the situation of simple containment.<p>I suppose technically this could be seen as a partial meltdown; but the truth is that this situation is at the very edge of the margin for such a problem. A meltdown is not a binary thing, but in this case it is not really a meltdown, and that was my main point.<p>Right now it is absolutely recoverable, and based on the latest data #1 and #3 reactors will be fine from this point on.

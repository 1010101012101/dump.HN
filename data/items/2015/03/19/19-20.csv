It is bittersweet for me, the opportunity lost to keep funding NASA at a reasonable level could have a lot of useful data in the &#x27;bank&#x27; as it were, but by and large much of the stuff that makes what SpaceX does possible is relatively new. In particular the avionics and MEMs manufacturing has allowed the mass fraction of the operations bits of the rocket to plummet.<p>I&#x27;m still curious though how they got a 30% improvement, and if it was a retelling of the Merlin 1C -> 1D evolution of if this is really a Merlin 1D+. They have also hinted at a project &quot;Raptor&quot; which is a ginormous engine.<p>And finally it really puts a bad light on &quot;Cost Plus&quot; contracts and the folks at Boeing and ULA who have supplied launch platforms for the last few decades. Clearly nobody in the &quot;old guard&quot; really cared about space, they just wanted to keep the money flowing. I am <i>profoundly</i> glad that they are being shaken up. Perhaps some of the management there will actually listen to what the engineers have been proposing for years and years.",1426795097

I understand your sentiment, but what you&#x27;ve said is pretty condescending. I would agree that creating content for the sole purpose of making &quot;YouTube money&quot; is silly. I would argue that, to the vast majority of YouTubers, it&#x27;s simply an enjoyable hobby with RPMs as a potential bonus. The RPMs are intrinsically motivating. There is nothing wrong with being honest with yourself and admitting that they play a factor in the motivation needed to create vs. do something else.<p>Anyways, my point is, if a capable programmer enjoys making monetized videos on the side, the fact that there are &quot;astoundingly better options in life&quot; is irrelevant.",1426795073

I&#x27;m defining compound knowledge as knowledge that builds on other knowledge. It&#x27;s kind of like proofs in math, once you have learned a proof you often learn a shortcut for that proof that might not make a ton of sense at a glance and almost like &quot;magic&quot;. Similar to using libraries that &quot;just work&quot;, someone already figured out the hard stuff and they&#x27;ve abstracted it so you can easily use the concepts at a high level.<p>Things like frameworks are amazing tools and give 1000&#x27;s (and often many more) man-hours of work for free. However just like math proofs if you don&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s doing under the hood you can get tripped up when you try to do something that &quot;looks&quot; like it should work but actually doesn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating that we all must know what every library we use does under the hood, for most higher-level languages JS/PHP/Python/Ruby/etc this would be impossible (not just knowing what, for example, a php library does with PHP but what&#x27;s happening in C to make that happen, you can take that even further and go down to machine code). We have to make some assumptions but I don&#x27;t think/know if there is a hard line on how low we need to go.<p>Personally I stay as high level as I can until there is an issue then I will dig deeper, I&#x27;m sure there is a whole spectrum of developers ranging from ones like me to ones that read every line of a library before they include it in their project.<p>I don&#x27;t have the answers, like I said this is something I think about a lot. Take a look at the NodeJS/npm ecosystem, you can easily see when you run &#x27;npm install&#x27; that you are installing Library A that makes use of Library B and C which makes use of Library D and E.... So on and so forth. It&#x27;s one of the best things about OS software development, you can build on what already exists instead of always re-inventing the wheel. But that comes at the cost of having to make assumptions about the code you are using. I always worry that I&#x27;m building a house of cards that will come tumbling down and even worse if it all comes tumbling down in a library I use so it&#x27;s not as easy for me to fix it directly.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t have any answers, this is just me rambling about a concept I bat around in my head all the time.",1426794219

Or sometimes it&#x27;s using assumptions in places where they don&#x27;t hold, eg. &quot;Google makes $X per search result shown, and Facebook has more pageviews than Google, therefore Facebook should be worth more than Google&quot; even though people search when they&#x27;re further down the purchasing funnel than looking at social media and so search clicks are often worth a lot more.<p>Anyway, capitalism is naturally self-correcting in this regard.  People who build their businesses on invalid assumptions go out of business; what&#x27;s left are the people whose assumptions turned out to be right.  All bubbles eventually pop.

If one user plays 300 tracks per month (one 10-track album per day), and another user plays music 24/7 (the gyms that have been mentioned before), why should the per-play fee be the same in both cases? If this was a pay-per-play model that would be fine, but this is all-you-can-eat streaming. Users that listen to a disproportionately high number of songs should not dictate which artists get money. That awards those users far more than their normal $10/mo purchasing power.<p>This scheme is similar to the proposal to calculate artist pay independently for each user, but I think it&#x27;s a little simpler, since you still only calculate the artist pay out of the global pot, you&#x27;re just weighing each play by the user&#x27;s total monthly plays. And you can put a minimum on it too, so the per-play weighting doesn&#x27;t take effect until the user listens to more than a given number of tracks per month (this way the user who has a subscription but just occasionally listens to a song here and there isn&#x27;t paying the artist $1 per play, which is to say, until you reach a certain point, listening to other songs won&#x27;t &quot;devalue&quot; your previous tracks).",1426793738

The problem is that &quot;rent&quot; is defined as &quot;profits earned above what would be earned in a competitive market,&quot; but &quot;competitive market&quot; isn&#x27;t well-defined until you define a system of rights (namely property rights).</i><p>First comes the existence of &quot;intellectual property&quot; in property rights. To avoid the dependence of the right to property on the state or the monarch, John Locke and others argued for the concept of &quot;natural rights&quot; - the right to physical property and land property I think are included in this while intellectual property such as copy rights have not been.<p>After all, if property is merely an administrative system established by the state for some purpose, such a system can be changed if it happens to not serve that purpose. The assumption of natural property is that (land and mobile) property rights are a prerequisite for the existence of a just state rather than the result of the state. So-called intellectual property is always the product of a state, indeed intellectual property is always a monopoly of activity granted by the state (with the &quot;natural rights&quot; argument being aimed to claim natural property rights are more than that).<p>Now, a purely formal, economic definition only judges the structure of a market in question. So it simply gives what difference between what a competitive market would charge for a good and what a non-competitive market actually charges. Since &quot;intellectual property&quot; is a monopoly granted by the state, the degree of rent they allow is most easily calculated. If anything, the trickier thing is calculating how much rent simpler property rights involve.",1426792706

In my opinion, nothing is more important for the success of a company than the psychological foundations of the executive team and investors. They set the incentive structures, and their subordinates do their best to carry them out.<p>In most companies, the incentive structure is to get paid as much as possible by playing office politics.

You are only performing the operation a countable number of times, and at each point you only add a finite number of points, so having an uncountable set pop out at the end seems unlikely.<p>A bonehead way to formalize this:<p>The first step outputs {0}, the second, {0, 1/2}, the third {0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4}, etc.<p>We drop them all into one big set A. A has countably many elements and they all have a finite size:\nA = {{0}, {1/2}, ... }<p>If B is the union of A, it has to have every point that could ever be output by the process. B is the result of &quot;running the process to infinity.&quot; B is obviously countable since it&#x27;s the union of countably many finite sets.<p>If you can think of a way to define running the process to infinity and -including- the limit points, I&#x27;d be interested, but the most natural interpretation to me is that the process produces a set that doesn&#x27;t include the limit points at all.",1426792445

In 2015 the world supply of 12 inch Macbooks increased suddenly and unexpectedly.  Nobody saw it coming.  The world simply has a great new product in it starting in 2015 that it didn&#x27;t have in 2014 or 2013.  On HN there were 1269 comments:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9172373"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9172373</a><p>One thousand, two hundred, sixty-nine!  The current front-page has 6-12 comments on most stories, and tops out at 59 for a popular OpenSSL security advisory people care about and are discussing, to up to 141 for a large piece of news about Tesla direct sales being allowed in NJ.  (A big issue because people feel strongly about this.)<p>1269 comments on the 12 inch macbook.  Clearly people feel strongly about the sudden discovery of 12 inch Macbook deposits worldwide!  It&#x27;s a totally new thing, amazing.<p>The top comment at that link states that this is a beautiful machine.  Another comment says &quot;The overall design of the new MacBook is revolutionary.&quot;<p>This is a spontaneous revolution that happened worldwide in 2015.  Now let&#x27;s turn to rents.  As another poster said in the present thread[1],<p>&quot;A graph of world economic growth since the invention of fire shows anything but diminishing returns however.  If rent-seeking behaviour is increasing, it&#x27;s because the pie is - at least on a global level - growing at an accelerating rate.&quot;<p>The amount of value this machine has for users is way more than the incremental increase in what was available between 1982 and 1983, for example, at the same number of inflation-adjusted dollars.<p>But that other poster continues in the same comment (still [1], in this thread):<p>&quot;Elites always have and always will seek to take disproportionate shares of that wealth because they can.&quot;<p>Apple is an elite market-maker.  Although there is a spontaneous increase in 2015 in the availability of the highly desirable 12-inch Macbook, in fact Apple is not giving them away at cost.  Or even within 5% of cost.  It has positioned itself as a rentier sitting on its laurels and enjoying the profits of the worldwide spontaneous existence of a large deposit of totally new 12 inch Macbooks.  It is taking a <i>disproportionate share</i> of the wealth, the actual, true, value that has just spontaneously sprung into existence this year without any work from Apple.<p>Out of nowhere, you have a trackpad that responds to a force-push.<p>Out of nowhere, you have a machine that weighs just a hair over 2 pounds, a full pound lighter than the previous 13-inch macbook air and 16% lighter than the previous, impossibly small 11-inch Macbook air.  But with a full-size 12 inch retina display, and lasting 9 hours on a charge.<p>People want it.  I want it.  But Apple is hoarding this spontaneous innovation and creation.  Truly, no clearer example could possibly be found of &quot;Elites have and will always take disproportionate share of wealth&quot;, than Apple, which has secured a one hundred percent monopoly on a spontaneous natural resource that everyone could enjoy.<p>This is rent in action.  It has led to a smart phone in every single person&#x27;s pocket when they did it with the iPhone in 2007.  It has led to a proliferation of tablet PC&#x27;s that changed the face of mobile computing the world over, when they did it with the iPad.<p>And it makes my blood boil to see them do it with the 12 inch Macbook.  It&#x27;s just bald-faced theft of a disproportionate share of the world&#x27;s wealth.  They&#x27;re even blatant about it, with this graph:<p><a href=""http://www.patentlyapple.com/.a/6a0120a5580826970c01b8d0e769c0970c-800wi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyapple.com/.a/6a0120a5580826970c01b8d0e769...</a><p>How can they get away with this?

Combine that with the power of money in politics and gerrymandering and there is no way to fathom competition at the federal level.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, the UK has a similar sort of system, but the vote share of the major two parties has been consistently declining for fifty years. After WWII, almost everybody voted Labour or Conservative, now their combined share is about 65%. Soon, FPTP is going to start delivering some extremely odd results.",1426791683

52246,comment,52131,52131,0,0,mxh,,,"Multi-core's most immediate application won't be to algorithmic parallelization, which is a ball-breaker of a problem even w/o awkward theoretical results.  It will be to multitasking, VMs, etc. - scenarios where the utility of extra cores is pretty easy to see.<p>Those scenarios make the most immediate sense inside the data center.  I think part of the push towards SaaS and web-based applications will come from the fact that Moore's law will begin to apply disproportionately to hardware used to serve those solutions.  Soon, the same CPU might be able to run either one desktop or 50 virtual servers, making servers cheap relative to desktops.

It's turning a luxury into a commodity: good design.<p>It'll also make it easier to automate the construction process.<p>I was talking to an apartment developer at Ignite Boston who said that the Chinese are about the trounce all construction companies in the US because they actually have process-ized and optimized their methods. This is what allows them to build manufacturing cities so quickly.<p>As the industry gets globalized, US companies will experience what the ""big 3"" automakers felt with the Japanese.<p>The winner in a post-processized construction market will be the good designers.",1189277593

We do it all the time in our code.  It's merely syntax.<p>""All subroutine parameters are passed via @_, resulting in an imperative-style parsing of variables at the beginning of every sub.""<p>Likewise, pass an array ref, and you don't fiddle with parsing @_.  TMTOWTDI.<p>(Note that I'm not suggesting passing array refs for everyone or all subroutines...it's just a somewhat lispy way of thinking.  In OO development, a more ""imperative-style"" is appropriate, and we use that too.)<p>""A perl program is a file of perl statements, a lisp program is a lisp list of expressions.""<p>OK.  Wonderful.  Nonetheless, you have first-class functions in Perl.  Currying is possible (and not terribly ugly) in Perl.  Closures exist in Perl.<p>Macros do not, yet, exist in Perl 5.  But they exist in Perl 6.  That's the only significant gap I'm aware of (where ""significant"" means, ""a concept that cannot be replicated in the language without huge, long-winded, hacks"").  Syntax is arbitrary, and smart people can disagree on what good syntax looks like.  Power is a bit more tangible, and on the power continuum Perl holds up just fine.<p>""Perl has contexts.""<p>So?  Merely syntax.<p>""Also, Lisp reserves almost no characters. I can use square-bracket as a symbol name if I want.""<p>Again, so?<p>I'm talking about power, you're talking about implementation and syntax preferences.  You may feel that the beauty of Lisp is in the details, and that's wonderful.  I think Lisp is nifty, too.  But, there is also beauty in speed of development, and nothing is faster to develop than already written code.  Perl has the largest collection of free pre-written functionality of any modern language in CPAN.  It also happens that for my problem domain (system administration automation) Perl is effectively already a nearly ideal DSL.<p>For me, built-in grep and map and file tests and operations and regular expressions and taint mode and efficient hash tables and native Unicode and cheap enough concurrency and lots and lots of libraries are all killer features and Perl has all of them.  Sure, Lisp has a better map, by some definition of better, and I can pull in a regex library and probably a POSIX file library.  Erlang has better concurrency by all definitions.  Other languages are strong in other areas.  But nothing has them all...except Perl.<p>The nice thing is that we can both use our favorite languages for anything we want.  I will never come over to your house and force you to write (or read!) Perl code.  I promise.<p>I do think folks are missing out on some interesting ideas by closing their eyes and going ""neener neener neener neener"" with fingers in their ears every time someone mentions Perl, but that's no business of mine.",1189277592

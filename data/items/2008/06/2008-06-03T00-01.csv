207449,comment,207125,207125,0,0,tx,,,"Matt, you're confusing IP with copyrights. I've dealt with IP lawyers in the past, and those two terms mean very different things. Copyright law is actually a very murky water and certain kind of fish (lawyers) feel pretty comfortable swimming in there. Early YouTube investors clearly knew what's coming and they're prepared, they've get their fishies ready.<p>But those are boring technicalities. What matters is the fundamental question if one can proclaim things like music, literature and images as his property. Technically I can repeat one of your sentences and you can accuse me of stealing.<p>That's all huge bullshit in my opinion. A song or a movie by itself shouldn't be copyrightable simply because it's not fair: it takes a lot of money to enforce such laws, this is why there are only a few privileged ""customers"" of this system. I can copy and distribute your blog posts all I want and there is nothing you'll (likely) do about it. This ""copyright club"" doesn't treat outsiders nicely, this is why Google (clearly and outsider) has been bit so often by those assholes, even something as awesome as their ""Street View"" is facing idiotic copyright complaints.<p>And, personally, I believe they will all fail and technology will overtake. We will not be paying for songs and movies, we'll be paying for comfortable theaters with nice sound and live concert performances. And someone with a law degree will have to find a real job.",1212452760

Everything else is a mess.<p>Gentoo feels like someone sat down to a Debian or CentOS system, used it for a while, and said, ""You know, I really like it when I have to compile stuff from scratch, and make all of my own decisions about options and stuff and what tools to use, even though I have no idea what the difference is between various init systems, FTP servers, versions of Apache, configuration tools, etc.  I don't like how easy and quick installing software from apt-get or yum is, or how it all seems to Just Work when it's done.  I know, I'll borrow some ideas from FreeBSD's far more complicated to use and error-prone package management tools, and make a whole new Linux distribution that requires significantly more time and effort to use!  It'll be awesome!""  And a billion and one nerds with too much time on their hands saw it, loved it, and climbed right on board.<p>I'm sure I'll be voted down for this, as Gentoo has rabid fans, but I'm always stunned by how effectively the community markets Gentoo to new Linux users, and what an astonishingly bad experience it provides to those new users.  Encouraging learning is wonderful, but foisting a seriously challenging learning experience on to users while calling it an ""easy to use"" Linux distribution is doing them, and Linux in general, a grave disservice.

The difference nowadays is that consumers are becoming more educated. There was a time when an eight bit computer, a cruddy spreadsheet and a floppy drive compressed the tedium of an accountant from 38 hours per week to two hours per week. When that was the case, you could become part of a network effect or leverage an existing monopoly to sell bad knock-offs. It didn't matter if it crashed once per week because you'd still be four times more productive than doing the task manually.<p>Nowadays, expectations are higher, choices are wider and value lies elsewhere. Many people on this forum will remember when computer hardware and consumables were only available from specialist suppliers. That isn't the case anymore. Nor is it a de facto monopoly. Anyone in any major city can walk into a retailer and walk out with a computer that doesn't run Windows. Furthermore, anyone's nephew can install OpenOffice. People are now discovering that they can pay <i>less</i> and gain a productivity advantage. Having control of your data is a fringe benefit which they rarely consider.<p>Microsoft now has to work extremely hard and an increasing number are disatisfied. Unfortunately, too many consumers remain grateful for minimal productivity gains. Unfortunately, too many consumers take vendor shenanegans at face value. Fortunately, an increasing number of consumers have become wary of encumbants with a long history of market abuse.",1212451550

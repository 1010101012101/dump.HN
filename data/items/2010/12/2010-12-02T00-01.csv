They will just have very different 'single' uses for them.<p>Let's start with the iPod. Everyone uses it to listen to stuff. My brother listens to rap music, almost exclusively. My niece listens to whatever boy band is en vogue today. Very different genres of music. I love audiobooks on mine. Along with music. I have an aunt that has church sermons on hers.<p>Move to computers. I have not used a word processor in months. I spend a helluva lot of time in spreadsheets though. My niece, with her school reports, is the opposite. My nephew is almost exlusively a gamer on his computer.<p>Even the web. Most people have a dozen or so sites that account for 90% (made up stat) of their browsing time. It is a different dozen for all users though.<p>So yes, the vast majority of users will use their devices for only a handful of purposes.

1960496,comment,1958728,1960014,0,0,ryanelkins,,,"I agree. I think the adoption of the term ""gamification"" has caused a rift because really, this isn't about making things in to games or creating fun - it's about creating motivation. I think a big part of the backlash against ""gamification"" is this misdirection implied in the term. The feedback and reward mechanisms used are things that were honed in games - the idea is to take the ideas behind motivational and reward systems from games and move them into things that specifically aren't games - not to make these non-games into games.<p>I say this as a founder of a ""gamification"" or ""game mechanics"" 3rd party service provider. Unfortunately, the term is now lodged in our vernacular, I'm afraid.",1291251501

1960493,comment,1959782,1960423,0,0,jmillikin,,,"Say you've got a package webbrowser, which depends on libhttp<p>The Haskell package versioning policy < <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy</a> > says that your package metadata should specify a minimum and maximum bound on which version of libhttp you support; this way, if a new version of libhttp is released that is backwards-incompatible, they can bump the version and every dependent package will still build correctly.<p>Say the author of libhttp realizes he really needs to add another parameter to a function. That might break dependents, so it's backwards-incompatible. So he bumps the version from 2.3 to 2.4.<p>Like a good package author, your browser's dependencies look like this:<p><pre><code>    name: webbrowser
    version: 1.0

    build-depends:
      libhttp >= 2.3 && < 2.4
</code></pre>
Now you can be notified of the change via < <a href=""http://packdeps.haskellers.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packdeps.haskellers.com/</a> >, download his new package, test it, and verify it works. You didn't use that function, so the change doesn't apply to you. You can change your metadata to:<p><pre><code>    build-depends:
      libhttp >= 2.3 && < 2.5
</code></pre>
Except now there's a problem. Hackage doesn't support modifying already-uploaded packages; there's no way you can say ""webbrowser-1.0 supports 2.3 and 2.4"", because it already has a record for webbrowser-1.0. So you have to bump <i>your</i> version:<p><pre><code>    version: 1.0.0.1
</code></pre>
And re-upload.<p>And your choice is 1) do this for <i>every</i> package and <i>every</i> dependency, or 2) ignore the versioning policy, hope no dependency changes break your packages.<p>It sucks.<p>The general feeling I get from core Haskell developers is that they work in finance, medical, or other fields where every dependency has to undergo a four-month certification process before it can be used. So they don't care about this, because they just never see it.<p>But for somebody who just wants to publish his stuff online and let others use it, it's a <i>goddamn nightmare</i>.<p>The other day, the developer of the 'text' package bumped his version to 0.11. As far as I can tell, it doesn't actually <i>have</i> any significant changes. All he did was fix an obscure edge condition when a particular function is passed invalid input. Everything that could build against 0.10, will build against 0.11.<p>Since I followed the package versioning policy, most of my packages < <a href=""http://packdeps.haskellers.com/feed/?needle=John+Millikin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packdeps.haskellers.com/feed/?needle=John+Millikin</a> > are set to refuse his new version. It's not too bad now, but sooner or later a user will upgrade their 'text' and then try to install one of my packages and then they will email me asking me why I am so mean and restrictive.<p>Which means sometime in the next week or to, I need to sit down for a few hours and recompile all my stuff, then bump the versions, then <i>commit</i> and <i>tag</i> and <i>sign</i> and <i>push</i> and <i>sdist</i> and <i>upload</i>. And somewhere in that hour I'm going to be thinking about just removing the bounds check, and letting my users deal with whatever hell befalls them if in three years there <i>is</i> a real breaking change somewhere.",1291251449

If someone picks up that many flights, it means they do most of their flights for business (very few people fly for pleasure that far), which means they're buying much higher-priced tickets than people who are traveling for pleasure, and are the ones whose presence makes a flight turn a profit.<p>An example: if you're Super-Elite on Air Canada (95 flights or 100K miles per year) you have guaranteed flight availability up to six hours before departure. What does that mean? If you want to fly on a flight that's fully sold out - any flight - and call AC more than six hours before take-off, they will kick someone (or two people, as you can bring your companion too) off the plane so that you can get on. You will also get different call-center numbers, access to more rewards flights, more upgrade certificates than you can possibly use, and free upgrades when you choose not to use a certificate.<p>Legacy carriers, for the most part, do treat their frequent/loyal customers quite well.

Or check out this, which of all the things I've read isn't just a ""tee hee"" and actually resembles a real scandal:<p><i>In what is widely being seen as a dangerous blurring of the line between traditional diplomacy and intelligence work, the State Department has asked its diplomats to obtain ""credit card and frequent-flier numbers, work schedules and other personal information of foreign dignitaries,"" according to the New York Times' reporting on multiple cables dating back to 2008.</i><p>Gasp... blurring the line between diplomats and spies!  Of course, for hundreds, possibly thousands of years, the most common cover for intelligence agents has been diplomacy, so this isn't exactly news.  Embassies are nests of spies, yes, I have read a couple of John Le Carre novels.<p>The amount of <i>non</i>-news surrounding this ""event"" is just stunning.

I am not sure how the economics would work, but in order for it to be a good service with good support it would have to be commercial - not an open source project.<p>The only issue with that is that if there is one company, it makes it easier for major governments to try and get their hands on it. So for WikiLeaks case, it might not be completely helpful, but imagine the many other cases where popular/large sites are hit by constant DDOSs. I think there could be significant use there.

1960339,comment,1960161,1960161,0,0,grellas,,,"Federal judges have <i>enormous</i> power in a courtroom. Usually, they are very bright, very decisive, and pretty domineering. They also have lifetime tenure, subject to removal only on grounds of impeachment. Federal courts also use the single-assignment system (as opposed to what is known as a master calendar system) by which they will have a given case assigned to them from pre-trial all the way through to trial, meaning that a judge typically has lived with a given case through the process and knows it well.<p>Having litigated before such judges in quite a few settings (though not criminal), and having clerked for one back in the day, I can say with great assurance that, if the judge starts the trial by saying to you as a prosecutor, in effect, ""what the hell are we doing here,"" you know your case is in pretty serious trouble. When the judge goes on for a half hour straight berating you, it is doubly so. This does not mean that a determined prosecutor can't push a case forward but it will be a real uphill fight.<p>The items that offended the judge in particular: both the prosecution's witnesses had dirty hands relating to the central issue in the case (both having themselves committed crimes); the government's own manual had stipulated for the past decade that a crime of this type could only be a crime if the defendant acted with a willful intent to violate the law (<i>mens rea</i>) and the prosecutor waltzes in with proposed jury instructions (i.e., jury instructions that he is asking the judge to adopt as the court's own and use in instructing the jury in this case) that say that such an intent is <i>not</i> needed for the jury to find the defendant guilty.<p>Therefore, a case that reeks and a total lack of integrity in the government's position. And the judge says, in effect, ""what are you trying to pull in <i>my</i> court, Mr. Prosecutor."" Not a happy position for the prosecutor here, though I think this one deserves to squirm a little for doing what he did.",1291248456

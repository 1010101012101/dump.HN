1540304,comment,1539208,1539843,0,0,thetrumanshow,,,"""only a really, really bad developer would write that""<p>Let me challenge that and modify it just a bit, and we'll be in agreement: ""only a really, really bad developer would write that and actually think that it was a good, elegant implementation.""<p>Set aside this specific case, and we can look at the more general state of things...<p>See, there are other contexts where there are different priorities. I have worked in environments where a large if-block was preferred to an elegant solution. This typically happens if you are extending a big enterprise app,  have lots of junior developers on a team, or expecting to hand code off to a developer of questionable skills. Thus the business, and everyone in the decision tree, would be happy with the former implementation. If you happen to get TOO fancy, you might even get tagged as someone who writes unmaintainable, obfuscated code that only you can understand. Seen it! Gotta love politics in the office, eh?<p>I've also worked in an environment where there was social pressure to write really slick code. It probably wasn't the same level of pressure that startups seem to apply to themselves, but you could be sure to raise eyebrows (and heckles) in code reviews if you used something like the former 'cute' example. Architectural controls reigned those in, and people learned quickly.<p>In the end, I would say that you can't look at one friggin' function definition and proclaim someone to be a 'bad developer'. Maybe they built the conditional logic from the wording in a functional spec on a late Friday afternoon when they were zoned out and they intended to refactor the code later.",1279857507

Of course most people do best what they practice most, but one of the reasons phonetic input (Hanyu pinyin on the mainland, still BO PO MO FO mostly in Taiwan) is the predominant way of entering Hanzi computer data all over the Chinese-speaking world is that other methods were tried (since the 1980s, repeatedly) and found wanting.

This reminds me of the days in the 1980s when I had to translate handwritten manuscripts by magazine reporters in Chinese into English.

I meant to say as far as ease of transcribing spoken word onto paper, alphabet system is fundamentally easier, because you only have to remember 25-45 (approximately) number of characters. While in hieroglyphics, the number is much much larger.",1279854560

It is incredibly performant and stable in the most brutal environments.</i><p>I hate that line, you know what most of these companies have in common? They where started by guys with only a few years in the field and a vision. Some of them not the best developers in the world, just guys with a great idea for a product and a passion. The other thing they have in common, is that they have spent millions if not more on rolling their own solutions to compensate for a technology decision they made a long time ago in a garage.<p>This is the way it works, the new guys come in, they say well company X uses this, they build something on it because X is using it and they hit growing pains at a certain point.<p>Twitter is experiencing those growing pains now, fortunately they seem to be throwing out the bad and trying new things. A good deal of companies become dogmatic about their choice and given their success just throw money at it to build compensating workarounds.<p>MySQL was not chosen by those companies because of its merits, it was chosen because those companies started in a garage, and the technical selection was ""what are the other guys using in their garage"".",1279854348

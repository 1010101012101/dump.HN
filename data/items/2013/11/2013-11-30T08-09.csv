But the OP just says &#x27;upgrade often&#x27; which might mean anything and as such reminds me too much of iDiots [1], which is imo not what your upgrade strategy should be like (i.e. upgrading for the sake of upgrading).<p>Over the years I tried different upgrade schemes, and it seems 2 or 3 years works best for us. Over the course of that timespan there is an overall performance gain large enough to notice and worth money. If you go with less, say 1 year, the gain is much smaller, and you essentially pay for something that&#x27;s the same but just looks newer. Also depending on the country you live in, there&#x27;s a certain amount of time you can use hardware as an actual cost on your tax form. As such keeping it much longer than that time means loss, keeping it much shorter as well.<p>The psychological aspect (which we all know since childhood already and basically is set in our genese: new = interesting) does do something, of course, but has in my experience no long-term effect whatsoever apart from it costing money.

We could rightfully question the moral and ethical choices made by people willing to compromise their good judgement this way.<p>Yes, I tend to think in some cases it takes two to tango.  The guy is a slimeball who deserves financial consequences and jail time.  If the pictures were taken with her consent, she is at fault for not showing good judgement.  It was stupid and sometimes you pay for doing dumb things.<p>What she experienced was extreme and it should be criminal.  All I am saying is laws only protect you AFTER a crime was committed, not before.  The only way to protect yourself from this kind of crime is to behave in such a way that it is impossible to find yourself in that predicament, ever.<p>Another way to put it is: Killing is a crime with many laws and case law covering it.  This is not going to protect you if you walk into a dark alley in a seedy neighborhood and get killed.  Yes, the murderer is likely to go to jail if caught and convicted.  What got you killed was your decision to enter that alley in the first place.  You can&#x27;t live life thinking there are no criminals around you. Passing laws does little to change this.<p>If you are a woman reading this please remember:  if you are in a relationship with someone who wants to take nude or compromising pictures or video of you, run away from that man as quickly as you can.  He does not respect or protect you.  He does not look after your best interests.  He is an asshole.  If you allow it be prepared for these pictures to end-up anywhere at all.  Do not do it.  It could come back and ruin your life.  And please, don&#x27;t drink or do drugs to such an extent that you lose the ability to exercise good judgement.<p>Got to wonder about the girls in those girls gone wild videos.  How many of them will look back at what they did and think it was a good idea.",1385799253

The society without any government is possible in theory. It&#x27;s possible that in the distant future, human civilization will evolve to some kind of government-free organization.<p>However, you are claiming that it is possible today. \nLet&#x27;s say we completely remove all people from California,  restore it to its wild prehistoric state, and declare it a government-free zone. Anyone can move there and do whatever they like. No laws, no infrastructure, no social services, just wild nature. The blank slate. \nLet&#x27;s say a lot of all kinds of people from all over the world will move there and will want to start a new life.

10635916,comment,10631670,10635721,0,0,akiselev,,,"This is an interesting question that leads down a rabbit hole without a satisfying conclusion. If you think about it, evolution is a process with but one singular purpose: it is the ultimate arbiter, based on the laws of physics, of what objects exist and for how long. Thus one can argue that the function of everything is survival and propagation, from basic subatomic particles to rocks to living organisms to societies and civilizations to entire planets and stars.   Unless you assume that there are an infinite number of universes representing an infinite number of variations on the laws of physics, evolution (of anything) is random but not unguided. It&#x27;s a process thats less like a coin flip and far more like card counting in a black jack game: the next card may be random but its possibilities are very much bounded by the shuffling of the deck and the cards drawn so far.<p>To put it another way: without a universe there is no possibility for evolution (of anything) so naturally the function and survivability of an object is entirely dependent on the universe it exists in, and thus is &quot;guided&quot; somehow.<p>Edit: I use very humanizing language but the process of evolution has no external agency and this <i>cannot be emphasized enough.</i> Our language just gravitates toward describing natural selection as if it&#x27;s guided by a god, and not something as unrelatable as the ultimate laws of the universe.",1448600204

10635866,comment,10631670,10635721,0,0,derefr,,,"One succinct way to describe/pattern-match life is &quot;a process that lowers its own internal entropy, by consuming negentropy sources and emitting waste entropy.&quot; Which is <i>sort of</i> to say &quot;a process for bringing order out of chaos&quot;, but with the much more particular implication of <i>repairing</i> any internal insult that may occur to return to equilibrium. In short: life is that which maintains itself.<p>With that in mind—and <i>ignoring</i> the fact that things that cause successful reproduction take precedence (so &quot;suicide by mating&quot; is okay)—most everything in a living being has the &quot;function&quot;—at least, in an adaptive environment—of working to lower that living being&#x27;s internal entropy over some time-scale.<p>And everything that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> helping in that function—every part of the system that isn&#x27;t serving the system—is itself exactly the entropy that a living being, as a system, is trying to either excrete, wall off, bypass, or xenometabolize.<p>A completely benign bacterium trying to &quot;keep to itself&quot; in a host is, definitionally, still a parasite: its own self-maintenance <i>increases</i> the entropy of its environment, i.e. the host. And most every kind of host (other than the most primitive of marine microflora) has defenses for parasites, even of the most benign variety, precisely because &quot;keeping to oneself&quot; is still a net negative on the host. A body will only <i>tolerate</i> that which offers some form of symbiosis to it—things which aid the body in the goal of maintaining itself, giving back more than they cost to keep around.<p>(Obviously, I don&#x27;t mean to suggest a body will figure out how harmful a given bacterium is and decide how much to react to it. But rather, evolution will selectively adapt the host species to defend itself against anything that&#x27;s a net negative—while not putting nearly as much pressure to create defenses for things that are symbiotic.)<p>This applies to things besides parasites, too: &quot;vestigial features&quot; usually aren&#x27;t, but are rather usually still of some minimal benefit: chickens and penguins can&#x27;t fly, but flapping their wings still assists them in fleeing from predators. A feature that is truly no longer of <i>any</i> benefit to the species costs more to build and more to maintain than it&#x27;s &quot;worth&quot;, and so, if the relevant genome isn&#x27;t horribly spaghetti-linked, the feature genes will simply become methylated and turned off after a few generations. It&#x27;s quite accurate to say that any feature, any organ, any chemical in a body is there for a reason—or at least there for a function.",1448598942

10635855,comment,10634241,10635329,0,0,dcosson,,,"As I understand it, the process you describe is true of glucose but actually not fructose. Glucose gets absorbed into your blood, causes your pancreas to start releasing more insulin into the blood, which causes basically all the cells in your body to start absorbing glucose.<p>Fructose on the other hand can only be processed by your liver, so all the fructose you eat just kind of queues up for your liver to process it. It doesn&#x27;t cause you to release insulin so it has a low glycemic index. Your liver can convert fructose to glycogen and then to glucose to feed your cells if you don&#x27;t eat any carbs or glucose. But if you already have more than enough carbs/glucose, your liver instead converts the fructose to fat and stores it. This can lead to fatty liver and somewhat interestingly can also lead to insulin resistance which then makes you worse at processing glucose. Alcohol also gets processed exclusively in your liver and can cause fatty liver, so it is true that juice and beer can do a similar kind of damage.<p>Anyway, on the bigger point I 100% agree that juice is bad for you. It&#x27;s sad to see it so often touted as healthy.<p>EDIT: One thing I do wonder about, people always point to fiber as a reason why fruit is ok but fruit juice isn&#x27;t. It seems like it would be a lot easier to get people to start taking fiber supplements than to stop eating sugar, so why don&#x27;t we ever hear that advice?",1448598550

It&#x27;s building a model, just like we build models in physics or chemistry. The function of free electrons in an atom is to let many atoms stick together.

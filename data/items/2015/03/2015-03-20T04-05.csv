Say a bunch of restaurants are given star ratings by Yelp. If Google adds those ratings to its search listings then users don&#x27;t need to go to Yelp. Google gets a double benefit: Yelp&#x27;s content enhances the Google brand, and it stops them going to external sites. Yelp suffers a double loss: It loses unique content <i>and</i> loses traffic.<p>Google&#x27;s Knowledge Graph is where Google scrapes facts that other sites have compiled, most notably from Wikipedia, and presents it as its own data. This devalues all the sites that have compiled the facts, but greatly enhances Google.<p>When Google acts as a content site in its own right it inevitably comes into competition with the sites it ranks on the search engine, hence the (inevitable) anti-competitive behavior seen in the report.",1426827215

9236288,comment,9235251,9236042,0,0,philwelch,,,"I think the problem is actually exactly the opposite. People are horribly afraid of dying and incredibly uncomfortable discussing it. No one accepts death as part of life and everyone wastes a lot of time and money treating terminal illnesses without actually recovering very many QALY&#x27;s from the effort. People invent religions that posit some sort of afterlife so they can comfort themselves with the belief that they are immortal, and this is such a powerful impulse that even the supposedly non-religious, like de Grey, recreate this belief in the guise of science fiction.<p>“Don’t look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.<p>&quot;So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.”<p>Excerpt From: Marcus Aurelius & Gregory Hays. “Meditations.”",1426827140

9236283,comment,9232468,9236223,0,0,the_af,,,"In my opinion, there is a reason for that. Consider the example above, slightly changed:<p><pre><code>    public foo(Bar bar) {

        bar = qux(bar);

It is hard to spot the second reuse of variable <i>bar</i>. This can make code harder to understand; it&#x27;s a lot easier to just look at the point of definition of a variable and assume it never changes. At least, that is why I tend to use <i>final</i> when writing Java, and <i>val</i> when writing Scala.<p>Of course, usually when adding <i>final</i> to messy Java code I&#x27;m trying to understand, this ends up telling me that the whole piece of code was fragile, hard to understand and in dire need of a refactoring.

In a few generations, your phone will be little more than a terminal that connects to your personal virtual machine hosted on Apple/AWS/Google servers. This VM will run the respective company&#x27;s OS as well as its native apps. These apps will be unrecognizably more powerful than the ones currently on your phone, and your phone itself will be significantly lighter and more efficient (and, yes, probably wearable).<p>Google will continue to make money from ads delivered into this virtual space and it will also have more leverage to regulate 3rd party apps, giving it access to the space within the apps as well. Oh, and also all these virtual spaces will have private and public modes.<p>The biggest problem really is screen area. The only reason Google can&#x27;t exploit Android to its fullest potential is that phone screens just aren&#x27;t large enough to dedicate a sufficient screen area to advertisement (it&#x27;s a funny paradox: the phone as a real-life implement is limited to a form factor that precludes advertising space, which by its nature is always limited to &#x27;sub-prime real-estate&#x27;).

Any and all business can be considered monopolistic under antitrust law. Rulings are ex post facto. No business can know whether they have committed a crime or not, and will never know, until government decides to bring a case.<p>It is vain, however, to call simply for clearer statutory definitions of monopolistic practice. For the vagueness of the law results from the impossibility of laying down a cogent definition of monopoly on the market. Hence the chaotic shift of the government from one unjustifiable criterion of monopoly to another: size of firm, &quot;closeness&quot; of substitutes, charging a price &quot;too high&quot; or &quot;too low&quot; or the same as a competitor, merging that &quot;substantially lessens competition,&quot; etc.",1426825721

Erlang processes are then OS processes.<p>If your operating system is modern it lets you launch more processes than you have CPUs.<p>Also if one process crashes it doesn&#x27;t affect others.  This is pretty cool and useful. Anyone remember how much fun it was to run Windows 3.1 or Windows 95? Your game crashes and your word processor got screwed as well as a side effect. That is pretty primitive. We got better tools than that (Linux, Windows, etc). So this takes you a long way as far as the analogy works. Erlang processes have the same properties.<p>The only difference is that while you can probably have hundreds or maybe thousands OS processes on a large system, you can have many hundreds of thousands or even millions of Erlang processes. They are really lightweight (a couple of KB of memory only when they start up). The VM is a really awesome piece of engineering because it makes it all possible while also preserving isolated heaps (memory).",1426824299

Three cities built on the communist central planning principles of the post-war American suburb reflect, each in its own way, the oppression and alienation that motorcar-oriented planning imposes on humans. [0]<p>There is an alternative to suburban hell. The traditional city humans have loved for thousands of years is still possible. [1] There are even great accessible, affordable examples in Burma and Brazil. In places like North Korea and the USA, the destruction of traditional free ways of life has been more complete.<p>Though if you belong to the powerful and monied elite you might be able to afford to live in the few remaining neighborhoods in Pyongyang or San Francisco where traditional city design from decades ago is grandfathered in.<p>[0] <a href=""http://kunstler.com/books/the-geography-of-nowhere/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kunstler.com/books/the-geography-of-nowhere/</a>

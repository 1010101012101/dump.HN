4317906,comment,4315247,4315247,1,0,calbear81,,,"Almost all advertising systems/platforms today self-optimize when you are bidding against other advertisers vying for limited ad space.  It doesn't matter how you bid because at the end of the day there is an expected revenue per impression (or per thousand like an RPM) that is used to determine how much exposure you get.<p>For example:<p>CPC - You bid $1 per click to a sign up page for more information on your product. You get a conversion rate of 10% so after spending $10, you get one sign up and the CPA cost of that lead was $10.<p>CPA - You bid $5 per lead on the same system and observe the same conversion metrics. Now assuming the clickthrough rate was the same on that ad network, they only made $5 after the same number of impressions shown vs. the CPC model.  The effective CPC they made from sending over 10 clicks was $.50 instead of a dollar.<p>The ad platform will eventually optimize itself to give you a lower share of impressions if you bid the $5 CPA because it can normalize expected revenue/returns regardless of bidding models.  This is why with a lot of CPA deals, they require a test period to suss out the economic viability of your bid before they will commit to delivering a large amount of impressions on a CPA model on your behalf.",1343750387

If that's what you were paying, it's either that you had a poor quality score (hence high opportunity cost to show your ad according to Google) or it was a category that was competitive and had the economics to justify a $3+ CPC (simple economics).<p>2) Google has extensive bot traffic and fraud prevention to ensure ad clicks are not coming from fake people.  You tend to find much lower quality clicks when you opt into the content network but from the search network, I've never seen much fake activity (looking at logs/analytics, etc.).<p>3) It doesn't even matter what is being charged by Google, unless an advertiser is completely naive, they should be paying the cost that makes sense for their business.  I don't care if I pay $25 per click if I can make that back overall. Similarly, even if a portion of the clicks are fraudulent or bots, you should be adjusting your bids downward to reflect that.",1343749707

That's the reason for the existence of the LGPL, for example, which is recommended to be used in cases where the quasi-ultimatum of the GPL wouldn't be a successful strategy:<p><i>Using the ordinary GPL is not advantageous for every library. There are reasons that can make it better to use the Lesser GPL in certain cases. The most common case is when a free library's features are readily available for proprietary software through other alternative libraries. In that case, the library cannot give free software any particular advantage, so it is better to use the Lesser GPL for that library.</i><p><i>This is why we used the Lesser GPL for the GNU C library.

4317779,comment,4316685,4316751,4,0,JoshTriplett,,,"RMS and the FSF take a fairly narrow view of what they push for freedom on: they only care about code.  In my opinion, this stems from two issues.<p>First, I think that as people who write code, RMS and the FSF don't immediately see value in things other than code, and in particular don't see the value in supporting a community of developers around something other than code.  If you don't know how to produce something, you might not see the value in making it open, because you personally don't have the ability to contribute to it.  Many non-programmers don't immediately see the value in Free Software / Open Source Software, because they don't personally have the ability to contribute to it.<p>Second, the FSF has produced a large number of works of opinion, and they have rather specific thoughts about what they want done with those opinions, which for some reason they don't see as inconsistent with their views on software.  Note that all of the essays on gnu.org/philosophy/ have a license that allows redistribution but not modification; in many different places, they've expressed the opinion that works of opinion need not have free licenses, because changing such works would change the opinions expressed.<p>Personally, this seems entirely wrong to me.  If I take a copy of CSS3 and modify it, it no longer matches the CSS3 standard.  However, I could still usefully use it for other purposes, such as talking about the implications of different CSS models, or making a proposal for what I'd like to see in CSS.  And if for some reason I attempted to describe my modified version as CSS3 (or CSS3.1), that would make it no different than any other random bit of factual inaccuracy or buggy code on the Internet.

This of course is much more compact.<p>However it's not bad to have the current format to be exactly like the AOF, and the client protocol itself, so everything is the same currently... and is future/backward compatible without issues.

A well kept or restored grand piano from that era costs > $20,000 and can be one of the best deals out there for a good instrument. But any low end piano even one that's only 15-20 years old is destined for the dumpster before long.<p>There are two problems that cause this:<p>1. Lack of craftsmanship in the original instrument.<p>2. The expense and lack of skilled labor to restore and regulate pianos.<p>It's just too expensive and time consuming to have a skilled technician work on a low-quality piano, and because they are not made well in the first place, they just won't stay well-regulated for long.<p>Because of this, even a relatively new and good looking piano doesn't make a great instrument once it gets past a certain point.<p>This is a common problem in music schools. Most of the pianos are in poor condition and the technicians can't keep up with keeping them in good shape, and the good pianos are generally locked up and only the piano majors have access to them.<p>Only high end pianos are worth putting any time and money into, and because of that they actually make a good investment, while the value of low end pianos just drops off a cliff and they end up in a dumpster because they aren't even worth moving and repairing.",1343748980

I don't know how to read music.<p>A year ago, we were offered an upright Kimball built in 1970 by my newly acquired in-laws.  My father in law is a portly fellow and insisted we move it ourselves, but I instead paid exactly 300 dollars to have it moved the 14 miles from Exeter to Lee.<p>We let it adjust to the humidity in our house for a half a year, and then we paid exactly 175 dollars to have it tuned.  As subjective as this is, the man who tuned it said ""it was a D and now it is a B"".  He said that the Kimballs are a very cheap piano with a cheap sound, and tried to sell me a grand piano for 5000 dollars used.  It would have required I vacate my home office to the basement.<p>He had other pianos for sale, and some were as affordable (but as cheap) as the 300 dollars I paid for a free piano.<p>It's immensely pleasurable having a piano next to where I program.  I don't know what I am doing, but I suspect this is a lot of the allure - I sit there and poke, and figure out my programming challenge of the day while my fingers are occupied.  We all know full well how the frontal lobe needs to be engaged for the ""coprocessor"" to have a chance at resolving our issues for us.<p>The piano is about 4 feet wide and barely 2 feet from the wall.

Also, the class system lacked any semblance of balance with regards to level-ups; the only stat that was permanently raised when leveling up was HP, meaning that it was <i>always</i> best to level-up as whatever class had the best HP growths.  Furthermore, HP growths at level-up were based on a percentage of your existing HP, so if a character spent the first half of the game leveling as a low-HP class, their HP penalty would haunt them for the entire game.<p>I can't directly disagree with your statement that they ""actually put quite a bit of work into it,"" because they did produce new 3D assets, which is a non-trivial task, and the localization had to be done from scratch since it was the first time Final Fantasy III had ever been released outside Japan.

It should be dead simple to use and run, should be social and should be easily extendable for devs.<p>This is our first step towards that goal, it's a super simple, handmade server that runs our social ""operating system"", basically an awesome NAS, combined with a pretty cool groupchat, combined with filesharing capabilities. Perfect for small companies and dev shops.<p>Runs on: Ruby on Rails for authorization/authentication/CRUD, nodejs for all systemy things, a great amount of JS for what is being done in the browser and a fair amount of ruby and other glue code.<p>ps. if you want to have one be sure to enter hackernews into the message field at the end and you get 20% off - just whipped up some code to handle that (paypal should show the correct amount)<p>pps. we're looking for a great designer to bring our work to the next level UI/UX wise - contact me at ali@protonet.info if you're interested or know anyone who could be",1343746842

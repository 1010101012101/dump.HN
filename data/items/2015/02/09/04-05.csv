Make an array of height values initialized to zero<p>2. Run a tick() function that applies a spring force between neighboring values, then updates  their position/velocity<p>3. Perturb the middle value by a large amount<p>Not exactly real fluid mechanics but convincing enough.

I don&#x27;t like MySQL. I prefer PostgreSQL. And I have had a few rough times optimizing some queries in PostgreSQL, whereas I&#x27;ve had fewer such bad times with MySQL, despite using it more often. It&#x27;s anecdata. Take it for what it&#x27;s worth.<p>Time sinks in MySQL have come more from its crappy defaults, from its bizarre error handling (or lack thereof) in bulk imports, and most recently, a regression caused by a null pointer in the warning routine.<p>If I were working on my own project, I&#x27;d probably go with PostgreSQL and figure out the replication story. But I&#x27;m not. I do use PostrgeSQL on my personal projects.<p>(If there was one feature I&#x27;d add to PostgreSQL, it would be some means of temporarily and selectively disabling referential integrity. Not deferring it, not removing and readding foreign keys, just disabling. The app I work on does regular 10k-1M+ row bulk inserts, usually into a new table every time (10s of thousands of tables), but sometimes appending to an already 100M+ row table.

9019683,comment,9018798,9018798,0,0,rpcope1,,,"I think I dislike this blog post for many reasons, if nothing else because this guy&#x27;s understanding of the history of physics seems a little off. Einstein discovered the photoelectric effect in 1905, which did in some ways continue the experiments that would pave the way for modern quantum theory, but was really more known for special and general relativity, which still are being reconciled with quantum theory. To cast Einstein as someone who &quot;couldn&#x27;t adapt&quot; to the consequences of his earlier works or who was &quot;cast into obscurity&quot; after the 1930&#x27;s seems ignorant at best. While the Copenhagen interpretation seems to be the prevailing view in academia now, to belittle Einstein as almost a luddite in the face of the quantum revolution seems to under estimate how strange and questionable &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; was at the time, especially in the face of thought experiments such as the EPR paradox.<p>I also find the comparison of the quantum revolution in physics to the flash in the pan shiny apps that seem to come and go every couple of years also very questionable. To compare Facebook &quot;as a platform&quot; to the gravity of quantum mechanics seems rather insulting to the Physicists of the early 20th century.",1423454779

Even if you have the voice recognition setting turned off, the one on the remote still works by pressing the button.<p>The non-remote one does use a trigger word (&quot;hi tv&quot; by default) and it definitely does that processing locally (I know because i disconnected my TV from the internet and tried it). Basic commands (&quot;channel up&quot; etc) also worked. I don&#x27;t know what else to try to figure out when it goes out to the internet. I&#x27;d also add that the camera/microphone have a very visible hardware off (which I keep off, because life is too much like 1984 already).<p>Again, this is a 2013 model.",1423454754

9019679,comment,9017109,9019077,0,0,o2sd98,,,"Inflation is extremely harmful in the long term. Deflation is harmful in the short term. When you get a deflationary spiral, the shock to the economic system is sharp and sudden, and causes political/social unrest, economic upheaval, capital flight and sometimes horrendous wars.<p>Inflation on the other hand, in the long term, guarantees bifurcation of rich and poor (wealth disparity). The reason for this is fairly simple. The poor spend between 100 and 110 percent of their disposable income, and they spend it on consumption. The rich, on the other hand, invest at least 10 percent of their disposable income in some kind of asset, either fixed assets or financial assets. Assets can then be used as collateral against loans which are used to purchase more assets. Inflation erodes the real value of the loan i.e. the nominal principal of the loan does not inflate, but it&#x27;s real value deflates with inflation. Thus, inflation is a virtuous circle of asset ownership, which gives access to credit, which both increases assets owned, and whose liability decreases with inflation.<p>To put it another way, never ending inflation is a transfer mechanism of wealth from the poor to the rich. Once the poor realise this, they demand a political solution. The political solution inevitably involves increasing taxes on the middle class (the rich don&#x27;t pay taxes), to pay for social welfare programs (i.e. free money). In this way, inflation not only transfers wealth from the poor to the rich, it also indirectly destroys the middle class by crushing them with a punitive tax burden to placate the poor.",1423454598

When I were a lad, we did 15 hours every day gettin' coal down't mine. Ay, the youth o'today wouldn't know an 'ard days work if it bluddy well hit em in't face!",1200311633

I also keep the architecture in my head and the approach I have chosen to solve the problem. This works fine as long as I am not interrupted.<p>I cannot recommend trying to hold too much in your head at once. I has a bad effect on your creativity. Free your mind instead to have all necessary resources available to find the best solution for the current problem.<p>It is also an achievement to break down large chunks of work into small parts and solve only the small parts.<p>In this perspective it is absolutely useless to keep code in the head. It is written in the editor right in front of your eyes anyway.",1200311450

The other nine you can find on Reddit pretty quick.<p>Would it be possible to have some kind of category system or way of tagging/filtering stories to hone in on the relevant ones?<p>Thanks!",1200310699
98126,comment,97829,97829,0,0,jemptymethod,,,"I think this ""2-3 hours of real work per day"" stuff is a myth.  Or maybe this depends on a definition of ""real work"" that only entails ""heads-down"" ""in-the-zone"" coding.  Still I think it's too low.  I'm 44 and just a month and a half ago I had to intensely focus 9-10 hours a day to meet a very aggressive deadline (PG you are so wrong about us older coders ;)  It was exhilarating and while I wouldn't want to keep that up for months on end, I think 5-6 hours heads-down is definitely do-able.  What about the other 2-3 hours to come to an 8 hour day?  Well, there's analysis, documentation, email, etc.  Some people like to do this sort of thing first thing, but then is when I focus best.  Indeed by mid to late afternoon my brain is craving television, but I force myself to at least think about problems, even if I'm not solving them through code.  And it usually pays off, with a solution through code the next morning.  Anyway that's my experience.",1200310641

If you ask them to remember randomly placed chess pieces they fail just like the average person.",1200309817

Oh sure, companies might get billed four times as much (though in my experience it has 1.5 to 2.5 times as much: I've seen invoices sitting on my boss's desk, and once even the consulting company mistakenly sent the invoice to _my_ address).  Contractors probably get paid 1.25 times as much on average: the rest goes into some suit's undeserving pocket.",1200309532

336572,comment,334992,336444,0,0,igorhvr,,,"> I'm skeptical of this approach.<p>I can say it worked for me - I do not live like this, currently, but I remember fondly the feeling of waking up every day <i>overflowing</i> energy.<p>Try looking at this article - <a href=""http://www.supermemo.com/articles/sleep.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supermemo.com/articles/sleep.htm</a> - specifically look for ""free running sleep"".<p>> I've had very poor results with eating whenever I feel like it, and continuing until my body tells me to stop.<p>Poor comparison - I would guess what you ate could not be really considered food. That's were maybe the problem lies. Try to eat only healthy food - no compromises, no sugar, no junk at all - it is unlikely you will have bad results, even if you eat until your body tells you to stop.<p>> I can't say for certain, but I suspect they didn't have unlimited access to sleep either.<p>I reject the premise of your question - that it would be better if we did what our ancestors did - but I will just point out that not having artificial light (or an alarm clock) means that on average they likely slept much more than we do today.",1224355906
336570,comment,336536,336536,0,0,sidsavara,,,"There are a couple thing I wonder about:<p>1) Is sample size large enough to draw conclusions? They have people at bus stops, rail stop, people from the north. from London, etc but only 409 total?  And not everyone agreed to have their hands swabbed, so is it possible that the ""dirtier"" hands from London just turned down the swabbing?<p>And these are people who may also have just come off the rail or bus from elsewhere. If they all touched some common thing on the way out of the vehicle, they could be otherwise clean people who just got swabbed after picking up pathogens.<p>Still, half the people is really high.  They should redo the experiment and see if they reach the same conclusions.",1224355491

Starting the flow of communication starts me, personally, on the right foot, and gives the addressee more time to respond.<p>I most always have a cell phone on me. I like people and have no problem ignoring a call if need be. And as for not answering unknown numbers, give me a break. People are shy and often don't like leaving voicemail.",1224354666
336561,comment,336193,336193,0,0,jaytee_clone,,,"I don't think you can truely learn to be a self-starters.  Being a self-starter myself, I have friends who just don't have the drive to do it themselves, even after knowing/seeing that it's the only way to get things done.\nThus I'm convinced that this drive is mostly genetic. Plus, isn't the definition of a self-starter someone who accomplishes things on his own without prior instruction? Then being a self-starter is independent of the amount of instructions. If anything I'd throw my kids in public school to make them better self-starters, because self-starters have to learn to keep that drive going even when the mainstream population are followers.<p>That is not to say you can't learn the trades of being a self-starters, such as discipline, progress logging, mini-goal management, lauch-then-iterate, etc. But that comes with experience. I won't even attempt to teach these things to kids under 12.",1224354581

336550,comment,336500,336546,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"It took days of forum diving to get Ubuntu up and running on my desktop. My wireless networking still doesn't work after following a handful of 20-step installation guides, compiling a few kernel modules, editing a few configuration files and the like. Eventually I gave up and strung a 100 ft. Cat 5 cable to the house router. If I weren't already so determined to use it, I would have given up and spent $99 on an XP disk a long time ago.<p>That said, Ubuntu works great on my Lenovo laptop, not that you would know that from the gargantuan and labyrinthine hardware compatibility lists.<p>Linux is hard.

I have lots of friends who use Linux; many of them are not programmers/hackers. Quite often my non-technical friends mention they are thinking of trying Linux (I advise them to go with Ubuntu).<p>So while many, perhaps even most Linux users are hackers, many are just ""normal"" people using it to get a job done.",1224353033

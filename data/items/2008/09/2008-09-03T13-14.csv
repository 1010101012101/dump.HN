Although I must admit I worry about what this means for projects such as Firefox, I do think that it will ultimately be good for the web.<p>Hopefully some equilibrium can be established between the Google and Mozilla camps, but only time will tell if the market can actually support multiple FOSS browsers.<p>In any case, I am optimistic about what a giant such as Google can bring to the table as competition to the likes of AIR and Silverlight.",1220449884

So, if you stack the line of scrimmage for a blitz there should be several people wide open on either side of you that you can throw. Also, this is high school where players are much slower.

JITing code of these languages surely is possible (compare e.g. with psyco, exceptions might be eval'ed statements and the like...), however, all of these languages take the approach of a simple but fast compiler and having an interpreter as an execution engine (where more optimizations are easily possible), hence the ideas are not directly applicable (as far as python is concerned: their explicit goal is to have the utmost simplicity in their compiler/interpreter)<p>also, while the JITing part of the v8 surely is nice by itself, IMHO the real runtime performance seems to come from the inlining by what they call ""fast property access"" -- the papers cited are a very good reference; indepth details can be found via scholar.google.com, though not explicitly mentioned, i figure that PICS, polymorphic inlince caches, are relevant too...<p>besides that i find the source code very interesting, it seems that it's just a very small codebase (with ""ugly"" c++ coding standards--given my subjective taste of course; i liked ellemtel guidelines best...); actually, i found myself looking for the ""rest"" until it became obvious thats all...",1220448922

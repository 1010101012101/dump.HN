I don&#x27;t know what the answer to all of this is - I like free products as much as the next guy - but it seems like a messed up situation. If the NSA were stopped from collecting our data, that would only prevent one party from doing so.

Just don&#x27;t grant special privileges to people based on their net-worth.<p>Nor is a competence test complex: I already outlined a possible regime. Just reuse any college degree in a related field, or any existing related professional certification (CPA/Series7/Bar). More generally, simply saying that &quot;whatever test applies to the rich, will also apply to the poor&quot; will tend to work itself out. Regulators will figure out some protective test that the rich can tolerate, and that&#x27;s good enough for the poor as well.<p>People are wealthier and more educated than ever before. More information about others&#x27; experiences is available at little cost. More people have incremental experience with similar instruments (such as public companies).<p>But most importantly, anyone who&#x27;s stayed &#x27;middle-class&#x27; has <i>already</i> resisted thousands of kinds of <i>legal</i> scams, some promoted by the government (like lotteries and home-ownership-at-all-costs) that could easily relieve them of all their money. &quot;Massive culling of the fortunes of the middle class at once and causing social unrest&quot; is a paranoid, fancifully unrealistic scenario. Some people would dabble in private-investing like they have with many other financially risky activities, and over time they&#x27;d either receive positive reinforcement for sustainable actions, or negative reinforcement for recklessness. Investing in the same sorts of deals as millionaires is not an unprecedented and magically addictive activity that the poor can&#x27;t resist.",1386816969

Germany started thinking about becoming Germany not that long afterwards, and did so, incidentally in France, in the 19th century.<p>Some people suggest that one of the reasons Napoleon was able to do so well militarily in the earlier years was this &quot;Levée en masse&quot; - most other countries at the time being a little hesitant to arm and train the peasantry, for fear they might demand rights.   Civilization says that it&#x27;s the Republic, not Nationalism that is the prerequisite for conscription, but eh.<p>On racism, yeah, what you are calling  Tribalistic derogation  -  when it is based on inherited characteristics and actually ends in discrimination, functionally sounds a lot like racism, even if it happened before the term was coined.<p>How did that work in, say, the 16th century?

However, they will be directly competing with consoles for space under the television.<p>As for solving your problem with hardware confusion, they could have manufacturers ship Steam Machines with some kind of rating system. Remember how Windows had those performance ratings for memory, processor, etc? They could do something very similar. You look at a Steam Machine, it says processor 5.7, memory 4.5, graphics, 5.1. Then you look in the Steam game library and see a certain game recommends graphics 4.5 or greater. Or this indie title plays great on anything 3.4 or higher. You use those numbers to guide your purchase.<p>Changing hardware will come to their advantage though. Xbox and Playstation will ramp up over the next few years, and we&#x27;ll see some improvements and major titles heading their way. However, what&#x27;s happening 5-6 years from now? Xbox and Playstation are dated, Steam OS has the bugs worked out, and Steam Machines are available with the latest advances in hardware. Where are you going to buy Call of Duty now, for your 6 year old console, or pickup a Steam Machine that can run it twice as fast, at Ultra HD resolution? That&#x27;s going to be a big plus for Steam, and if people are buying in 5 or 6 years from now, they&#x27;re less likely to jump on the next console launch, since they already have powerful hardware in their living room.<p>Another huge plus for Steam in the living room is Oculus Rift. If it&#x27;s released below $300, and exclusive to the PC and Steam Machines, they have a unique experience the consoles can&#x27;t offer.<p>Nothing is short term, I think Steam Machines will make a crawl the first few years, but I think they&#x27;re going to be pushing to replace consoles, and I think they might succeed. Cheap games, big sales, Oculus Rift, low cost or high performance hardware to choose from, and eventually an open store available for anyone to publish towards.<p>Edit: Oh, one other huge advantage. They&#x27;re backed by every hardware manufacturer they get involved. Dell is going to be dropping flyers in every mailbox around the world, with a couple of pages showing off their Steam Machine line-up. Dell wants money, and if Steam Machines succeed, they get rich as well. PC sales are down, they&#x27;d love another piece of hardware to sell. Get every other hardware company doing the same, and that&#x27;s a lot of free marketing.",1386814966

They&#x27;re not better enough to justify continuing to use a physical layout designed around 130 year old mechanical constraints.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m not saying people shouldn&#x27;t ditch QWERTY. They should. But that alone isn&#x27;t enough to just declare the battle won and go home.<p>(While the keyboard.io prototypes are labeled in QWERTY, the firmware speaks Dvorak and Colemak as well. As of last weekend, it also speaks Workman and a variant of the Maltron layout.)",1386814158

Strategy to me is what to measure, although there is some technical strategy on how to measure and display the data so it isn&#x27;t overwhelming and useless.<p>First, measure most everything at the day, week, month and yearly level, then do week over week, month over month and year over year comparisons. Usually this means we store the most granular level and then rollup from there.<p>What to measure depends on what you are doing, but IMO these are some general things you should always measure: signups, cancels, time on site, time from signup to first use, A/B tests of course on features, pricing etc.  This is in addition to the normal reliability, server metrics etc.   I recently setup our sites to start tracking peoples first visit until signup, of course this isn&#x27;t foolproof as it relies on a cookie, but I think it will help us over time.<p>The key to the analytics/metrics is you want to be able to cross section them and be able to look at when you add a new feature, or remove something etc.<p>Frankly, besides storing normal metrics, we store every API call, the time it takes, who made it, which machines were involved etc.  This lets us basically look at everything that happens.  From that I can get signups, cancellations, engagement statistics and a whole host of other things, this solves most of the business questions and almost all operational concerns like machines being whacked.<p>Not saying my ideas are 100% right or even correct in all circumstances, but thought I&#x27;d at least share.",1386814092

Water vapor is a limited feedback: if you double CO2 concentration, the additional water vapor will increase temperatures further, but only enough to induce a fraction of the original amount of increased water vapor to be sucked into the atmosphere. If this weren&#x27;t the case, small deviations in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere would cause even greater deviations, leading to runaway global warming until other, negative feedbacks grow large enough to counteract it; in other words, we must be in a stable equilibrium, as an unstable equilibrium would have already collapsed into a nearby stable one.<p>Methane clathrate guns aren&#x27;t the same: the idea there is that we&#x27;ve not historically explored the relevant parameter landscape (oceanic acidity + temperatures). People hypothesize that, if we&#x27;re not careful, we can stumble into a saddle point where a small delta propels us away from our current equilibrium and toward one with much higher mean surface temperature.<p>All of this is to say that water vapor feedbacks are well established, while a methane clathrate gun is just a speculative hypothesis.",1386813825

They followed a strict curriculum and &quot;deep conversations&quot; were a very rare occurrence. I was actually only taught by a full professor in 2 classes.\nThe majority of the classes I took were required general education fulfillers, again taught by graduate students, and not subjects I was interested in (read: homework grind).\nThere were tons and tons of facilities, athletics, teams, etc. I participated in a lot of teams and loved them, but I probably only took part in 1% of what the college as a whole offered.\nAt the college I went, the average professor makes $91,000 a year. The average administrator salary was $286,000.<p>I agree with Dan that college provides enormous value, but It also comes with enormous waste. When people talk about the outrageous cost of higher education, it is because so little of the tuition money goes towards the actual education, and the few activities a student participates in, and a huge amount goes towards giant administrative fees, unnecessary facility fees, research employees who do not benefit undergraduate students, etc.\nIs college extremely valuable? Of course. Is the already high and increasing price justified? I don&#x27;t think so at all. Are MOOCs the answer? Not with the experience and engagement level they currently have.\nI see college as not worth the cost due to problems of bureaucracy and financial models. MOOCs have a much better model of precision education -- you get to learn what you want to learn, and don&#x27;t have to support the stuff you don&#x27;t use. Though they are certainly grappling with huge problems of engagement, and the experience is terribly incomplete due to the lack of physical peers and extra-curricular activities.",1386813675

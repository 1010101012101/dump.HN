And of course,  the future trajectory may be quite different.<p>The movie industry,  for one thing,  is intelligent about pricing.  In particular, if you want to see a movie you've got a choices that range between a 3D theatre ticket,  $40 collectors editions, usually several Blu-Ray and DVD editions with different features, $5 bargain disks as well as movie channels, Vudu, Netflix, Redbox and other things.<p>Now,  in the long term it's an interesting question if ""TV"" is the same medium if you watch it going by on a set or if you watch it prerecorded on your own schedule.  There are certainly forms of ""TV"" like cable news and the weather channel that will dry up and blow away in the digital transition.",1330113582

3630733,comment,3629855,3629855,6,0,Jun8,,,"The title compares <i>all</i> the money given out by Kickstarter (including non-art projects) to NEA's budget, which <i>as of now</i> is not a fair comparison. However, I think this is a technicality, since at the rate KS is growing, the comparison will be valid very soon.<p>The second apples and oranges point is stronger though: Look at the types of projects that NEA funds, e.g. translation projects in 2011 (<a href=""http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/12grants/LitTranslation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/12grants/LitTranslation.htm...</a>): although the grants are tiny (~$10K) I don't think these are types of things that would have shined in the KS environment. So NEA is doing this as a public service, funding people who wouldn't have been funded otherwise. This is important. I remember Tarkovsky's lamenting the fact that his film <i>The Mirror</i> was not understood by the people so he had difficulty getting his other projects funded by Goskino (from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky#Film_career_in_the_Soviet_Union"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky#Film_career_in...</a>: ""From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature."") <i>That's</i> why the state has to be in the business of funding arts, to protect artists from the ""tyranny of mass taste"" (unfortunately, in Russia this worked backwards).<p>Now, after having said all that, let us once again emphasize the fresh approach KS brought to arts funding. I bet if/when they thought about KS before, the NEA people (most likely they haven't heard about KS, as these are not exactly cutting edge Internet technology people) they chuckled about the naivete of its approach, thinking it a fad (forget about NEA, I thought like this myself!). After millions of dollars of arts funding, they'll probably take the crowd sourcing approach more seriously. Patron-based art funding is hundreds of years old, the difference here is the number of patrons backing each project.",1330113496

May Alice legitimately be constrained from\n(or sanctioned for) expressing herself in this language?<p>2.  If a communication by Alice in this language \nhas been audio-recorded, under what condition \nmay she legitimately be compelled to translate \nthe recording?<p>3.  If the communication of item #2 has been \nrendered -- or even originally produced --\nin a faithful phonetic written form on a \nsingle paper copy, under what condition may \nAlice legitimately be compelled to translate it?<p>4.  If the single copy of #3 is instead digital,\nproduced in a manner such that nothing about \nits location, file-name, etc. imply anything \nabout the content of the communication, then \nunder what condition may Alice legitimately be \ncompelled to translate it?<p>5.  Now imagine another person, Carol, \nan ""idiot savante"", with idioglossic capability \nwhich superficially seems equivalent to Alice's.\nHowever, Carol's case is different, in that she \nhas the mental ability to perform the most \nadvanced and secure key-generation, encryption,\nand decryption without artificial aids.\nCarol's talent is so profound, that her \nencrypted-from-english speech -- and her \ncomprehension of any received communication which \nhas been thus encrypted -- occurs in real-time,\nand is indistinguishable from the naturalistic \ncommunication of a speaker of some unknown \nlanguage (e.g. Alice).<p>Are the answers to items #1-through-#4 any \ndifferent in Carol's case?<p>6.  Suppose that Ted purchases a new, blank, \nnever-formatted hard-drive, formats it,\ncreates a top-level directory named ""Porn"",\nand three subordinate directories named\n""Adults"",""Teens"", and ""Even Younger"",\nand in the last creates a subordinate directory \nnamed ""Screamed So Loud, I Had To Wear Hearing \nProtection"".  Into this directory he creates --\neiher copied or ""de novo"" --\na file named ""I Got This From Alice.mpg.pgp""\nand one named ""I Got This From Carol.mpg.pgp"".\nTed then purchases a new laptop computer, \nand replaces its single hard-drive with \nthe one containing those files.<p>Ted then proceeds quickly to a nearby place,\nwhere he is detained and the computer examined,\nand the the presence of the files is discerned \nby the examining authority.  Forensic \nexamination of the contents is fruitless.\nIANAL, but I believe that it can reqasonably \nbe said that Ted has committed no illegal act \nin arriving at this moment.<p>What can legitimately be compelled of any of \nthe three named parties?<p>7.  Ted is suspected of having child-porn on the \ndisk, and is arrested.  From the moment of his \narrival at the place where is was originally \ndetained,until the moment when a court orders \nTed to render the files intelligible, Ted has \ncommunicated <i>nothing</i> to anyone except the \nbare minimum which is legally required \n(name, etc.).<p>The ""government"" has expended enormous effort \nand expense in this entire matter. At this point \nTed complies with the court's order.  (IANAL, \nbut I believe that the exact manner in which he \ndoes this is irrelevant to the coming question.)<p>The contents of the files are shown to be \nnothing but the most scatalogical, vile, \nhorrific, vituperative, and scurrilous written \ncharacterizations of all of the individuals -- \nby name -- involved in Ted's detention, arrest, \nprosecution and trial, including any judge(s) involved.<p>From the perspective of knowing <i>nothing</i> of \nTed's intentions or actions before the \nexamination of his computer -- and nothing after \nexcept what was apparent to all involved \nwithout his cooperation --\ncan Ted reasonably be said to have violated any \nlaws?

And this translates to real inconvenience for me--I am forced to use Python when I would be better off with something else.<p>So the issue is not that I'm not willing to learn--I am! I even know Python fairly well (I do use it both at work and in classes, after all). And I am familiar with plenty of other languages, some worse but several better. So it <i>is</i> going to annoy me when somebody--yet again--presents Python as the best language you absolutely have to learn.<p>If you already know some similar languages, learning Python next is <i>not</i> your best option.

3630729,comment,3629570,3630194,5,0,antirez,,,"Well it's not really HINCRBY, it increments a field of a JSON object that is otherwise not supported by Redis natively. It was just an example, but it is not a strange one, because there are many users with JSON objects, and similarly there are many users with specific needs: Do this if there is that in the key, add this element only if the list is < N elements, and so forth. With Lua scripting you can model all this without back-and-forth without the client and server, in other words, with 1/100 of the latency (or less).<p>Given that we'll implement new commands only when they are ""fundamental"" operatons. For instance there is some plan to implement list splicing. When this happens it's worth to write it in C for max performances, so I think we'll unlikely write parts of Redis in Lua itself. Scripting systems is something I love (see Emacs for instance) but IMHO Redis is the instance of system where this does not work: space and time are too important for Redis.",1330113476

On our website, you'll see a demo or two (admittedly out of date) of how our platform generally works: Write your games once, using HTML5 and Javascript, and they'll run anywhere with essentially no code modification: Browser, mobile, tablet. There's two primary reasons it's a lot faster to work with our tech: First, for the reason I mentioned above (write-once, run anywhere). Second, writing at a higher level of abstraction (JavaScript vs. Objective-C and Java) makes iteration much faster.

Before, most people could get away with writing the entirety of their app as a single Rails or Django app.<p>I think the shift first started with the ascendancy of native mobile apps. Now, developers had to seriously start considering their HTTP APIs as first-class citizens and not nice-to-haves. Once that happened, it's not a big leap to realize that treating your web application as somehow different from any of your native clients is a bit, well, insane. You can either choose to write a server that is a mix of JSON API and rendered HTML, with conditionals all about trying to figure out the right thing to render, or you can pull all of that logic out into a stand-alone JavaScript application, with better responsiveness to boot.<p>I think this approach is a winner. The server guys can focus on building a kick-ass server, and the front-end guys can build an awesome UI without having to muck about in the server bits.<p>One thing that still blows my mind is how <i>hard</i> it still is to get data from the server to the client. Everyone is writing custom code specific to their app. As the article says:<p><i>There's no  reason for us to all separately think about these problems and solve them in a million different ways every time we're confronted with them.  Aside from the years of wasted time this involves, we've also got a bunch of non-standard and sub-standard APIs to interact with, so all the client code needs to be custom as well and nothing is reusable.</i><p>I think this is a huge problem, and Yehuda and I are doing our part to try to solve it. Our Ember Data framework (<a href=""http://github.com/emberjs/data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/emberjs/data</a>), by default, assumes certain things, such as the names of your routes and how associations should be loaded. We want to enable people to start building apps <i>right now</i> instead of writing hundreds of lines of JavaScript that are custom to their application, and do it in a sufficiently comprehensive way that you very rarely need to drop down ""to the metal."" For example, we handle things like mutating associations on the client-side even before a guid has been assigned to a record.<p>Personally, I'm excited for how this is going to all shake out. I think Rails will continue to be an important piece in the toolchain, but it will no longer be the primary one, and I can't wait to see how it evolves to fill that role.",1330112337

3630632,comment,3627389,3628237,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"I was working on WAN optimisers - ie something that would be sold to customers.  With WAN optimizers you would typically put one in a branch office and one at headquarters. The boxes would then compress traffic between them.  Typical compression ratios are 20x/95% - in other words your WAN link can now transfer about 20 times as much traffic.  Additionally some traffic would be modified to do read ahead and write behind to provide latency improvements.  An example of that was a user in Malaysia opening a Word document in San Jose, CA that was a 75kb file.  Without a WAN optimiser it would take almost 3 minutes while with one it would take 5 seconds.<p>The problem with SSL traffic is that it is encrypted and doesn't repeat even for identical underlying data, and hence can't be compressed, nor can it be modified.  This significantly hurts performance.  To work well the SSL would need to be stripped off, the traffic compressed/read ahead etc, sent over the WAN and then SSL put back on.  (The communication between the WAN optimisers was itself within IPSec or SSL.)  SSL is designed so that you can't pull shenanigans like this, unless you have the private key of the servers, or resign the traffic with a different CA that can generate the needed certificates on the fly and are ""trusted"" by the user.<p>Many internal corporate services have moved to SSL and branch office users need to access them.

Isolate is basically just a mini-Bundler with a different (arguably simpler) storage location, but the storage location is really not where the complaints about Bundler are coming from.<p>Rewriting things just to shed complexity or ""bloat"" will often just put you in a position where your library just can't do things it will need to do, and then you end up rewriting those things and adding back the complexity. It's the circle of life. Lack of SCM support in Isolate is a good example-- I'm pretty confident that Bundler's support of git is heavily used and taken for granted, but if you were to rewrite or use a simpler dependency manager, you're throwing this out.<p>This point feeds back into the larger issue of Rails vs. Node, I think. Rails ended up with all the complexity it has now because it was [mostly] necessary-- not all of it was, but much of it was. The idea that you're somehow liberating yourself by shedding complexity is often just the short-sighted pleasure of running faster test suites.

If you then don't read the manual and leave the car on a parking lot for <i>months</i>, then yes, you can ruin the battery.<p>So let's compare it to other early adopter technology. It took decades before motherboards didn't occasionally die during a BIOS update. For decades stereo equipment (and other expensive electronics) had a little slider on the back of the power supply labeled ""110v - 220v"". It wasn't always in the right position when you bought the device. If you forgot to switch it to the correct setting the device breaks, simple as that. Expensive cameras that you couldn't clean on the inside -- take them to the beach once and they're ruined forever. Cars with breaks that would fade so quickly that driving down a mountain became tantamount to suicide. Or how about power tools? They don't come with any manual and if you use them in the wrong condition you risk severe injury. Forget to turn off the stove before you leave for holiday? Your <i>house</i> might burn down.<p>So let's not lose perspective here.

The comments about being close to svn are pretty lame. While I get the point; subtle differences really won't matter after the first week. And getting over the mental difference that comes with distributed version control is a lot more to take in than a couple letter changes in commands.<p>The two things I most like about git are how -- by default -- you can choose line-by-line what gets commited. Where as the default in hg is to commit all changes. This actually changes how I find myself coding and my comfort with the repo. I know you can do something similar in hg, but it's a bit of a nuisance.<p>The other standout is how simple branching is in git.",1330111089

It had Media Center Edition which featured a new interface and WMC (along with DVR support). Tablet PC edition included touch screen software.

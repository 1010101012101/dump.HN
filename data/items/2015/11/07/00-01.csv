In sort, he&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s not his problem STFU and deal with it yourself. These comments are idiotic because any sort of security person knows that you can&#x27;t build a fortress on shifting and rotting foundations. You can pile as many sandboxes and intrusion detection systems you want, but they can all be bypassed if the kernel is weak.<p>So, to summarize, he knows he has a clusterfuck in his hands due to decades of \ndevelopment with 0 security mindset and he&#x27;s simply not willing to own up to it.

In 2004 I was in a Florida house built in 1988 which structurally resembled a concrete bunker outfitted with heavy duty crank windows. This was required construction at the time. A hurricane showed up mid August with 140 mph (225 kph) winds and two things in particular were impressive: how well the structure survived the hurricane essentially unscathed (other than damage to it&#x27;s pool cage screening) and witnessing how well palm trees folded their foliage to weather the onslaught. Apparently after 1988 they had lightened up on the building codes and cheap 2X4 frame construction was allowed for two story dense pack condos in the surrounding area. These did not fare so well. In one case a large pine tree was snapped at the base and hurled through the side of a frame condo complex like a battering ram, demolishing the whole structure. The complex had been evacuated before the hurricane struck so apparently there were no casualties. The moral of this story is that if you mandate good construction then that&#x27;s what you get. Leave loopholes for cheap construction and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll get (and it won&#x27;t suffer the rigors of time very well).",1446855485

Take the Turing test: the important part isn&#x27;t <i>the test</i>, it&#x27;s the high-level idea. You can get the high level idea without reading Turing&#x27;s original formulation, and that&#x27;s all that matters.<p>If you <i>do</i> read his original description, you&#x27;ll get bogged down in details like <i>running the test in an ESP-proof room</i>. At the end, you&#x27;ll either be <i>more</i> confused or, at best, not come away with a better understanding of the concepts themselves. Having read the article myself, I don&#x27;t recommend <i>except</i> out of historical curiosity. It&#x27;s not the best option to expand your understanding of CS or the philosophy of CS.<p>The same goes for a bunch of other foundational writing. We could take a topic I&#x27;m deeply familiar with: functional programming. It&#x27;s fair to say that much of it goes back to Backus, to his Turing-award speech with the catchy title &quot;Can Programming be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?&quot;. The title is worth it, the content isn&#x27;t. It was brilliant, of course, but it was just the beginning—one limited in arbitrary ways. You&#x27;re better off learning functional programming as it is now than getting into Backus&#x27;s FP (what he named his language) because that&#x27;s a less clear and, crucially, <i>less complete</i> presentation of the important ideas. The language didn&#x27;t even have named variables back then, it was like always writing in point-free style!<p>Again: it&#x27;s fine to read this from a <i>historical</i> perspective, but it&#x27;s not the best way to <i>learn functional programming</i> and you could be a perfectly capable, insightful functional programmer without having read it. Honestly, it feels like the call to read specific works like this is just signalling that you have the &quot;right&quot; background and education to work in a field, which is not where we want to be.<p>This is pretty consistent. Coming up with brilliant theories and insights is a different skill from polishing and completing them which is a different skill from presenting them well. And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with benefiting from the last part of this pipeline and skipping over earlier, &quot;historically relevant&quot; works especially in fields like CS and math.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that you shouldn&#x27;t learn the <i>concepts</i>, which you probably should. But there&#x27;s a big difference between &quot;having read Shannon&quot; and &quot;understanding information theory&quot;, and only one of those matters.",1446854553

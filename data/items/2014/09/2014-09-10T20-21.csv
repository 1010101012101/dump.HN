8299138,comment,8298155,8299077,3,0,slykat,,,"I don&#x27;t understand this perspective that much. Have you seen how road traffic works internationally, specifically Europe? There are many examples where significant bike traffic can safely share the road with cars. The Netherlands is one of the best examples here.<p>The issue is that:\n1) Road design - many/most cities do not have adequate road engineering to deal with bikes\n2) Driver training - Road drivers in the US aren&#x27;t trained to deal with non-car traffic\n3) Weak Bike traffic law enforcement - I don&#x27;t think that bike negligence is a key cause of accidents but I do agree that police enforcement of traffic laws on cyclists is lax.<p>So I disagree with the notion that bike traffic needs to have  a separate roadway from urban traffic. I think there are plenty of good examples where a sharing system works.",1410382784

Letting them work (a lot) and just after that letting them go is wrong. Is using them.</i><p>You&#x27;re on very shaky moral ground, and I don&#x27;t find it persuasive.  I don&#x27;t understand the moral obligation to inform as soon as the decision is made.  Employment is a 2 way street.  By this logic, employees are &quot;using&quot; their employers if they continue working while hunting for a new job.  I don&#x27;t buy that moral logic.<p>Moreover, morale is important for both employer and employee.  You don&#x27;t want to keep a disgruntled employee around to sap morale.  A significant blow to morale can sink the entire enterprise, multiplying the number of layoffs.<p>> <i>A simple way to assess that you&#x27;re up to no good is to see how the employees treat and refer to you after you let them go.</i><p>Entirely too simple.  An entirely legitimate difference of opinion can result in a disgruntled employee.  Employees can have wildly inaccurate estimates of their own value and productivity.  Losing your job almost always feels unfair.  Even the most amicable of splits can still result in latent bitterness.<p>So if a former employee does go on a rampage, it&#x27;s unreasonable to conclude that his employer was &quot;up to no good&quot;.",1410382663

There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and shopping centres to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.&quot;",1410382240

I can share a few guidelines that\nmay prove useful to the author or anyone else having similar trouble.<p>1) Profile. This does not mean gather a few charts from a primitive profiling\ntool that simply tells you which functions have the most time spent in them. You\nneed a real profiling tool that gives you detailed analysis of where your time\nis going. You need CPU stacks, time blocked, GC stacks -- everything you can get\nyour hands on. Your profile needs to tell you where, what, and how much you&#x27;re\nallocating. It needs to tell you what kind of allocations you are doing and how\nlong they are living.<p>2) Once you have your information, you need to figure out what you can do to\nimprove your performance. To do this, you need to know the characteristics of\nyour program and all the platforms it runs on. Is your code being JITed? How\nlong does your program spend in the JIT? Can you mitigate this by doing AOT\ncompilation, optimization profiles, or producing more JIT-friendly code? For GC,\nwhat kind of GC are you running on? Is in conservative -- do you have to worry\nabout memory leaks? Is it stop-the-world -- do you have to worry about pauses?\nIs it generational -- does the behavior change at inflection points? Do you have\nto adapt your allocations to the sections of your program&#x27;s run time? Does\nallocation in one portion affect allocations in another portion, e.g. will your\nallocations produce extra memory fragmentation when running on a non-moving GC?<p>3) You need to own your code and its performance. If you&#x27;re allocating in a hot\nloop and the GC can&#x27;t keep up, you need to rewrite that section to not allocate.\nIf you&#x27;re fragmenting the heap in non-critical paths, you need to stop\nallocating there, as well. If you&#x27;re constantly recreating re-usable ephemeral\nobjects, you need to look at object pooling. If you need to refactor sections\nof your code to avoid allocations and stop-the-world collections, <i>you need to do\nthat.</i> Blaming the GC will not make your application faster. If you need to\nbreak out a debugger and jump into the GC to see what&#x27;s taking so much time,\nthat&#x27;s what you need to do.<p>4) After you&#x27;ve optimized, re-evaluate. Are there actionable items you can hand\nto the GC devs? Can you point out general points where GC strategy has a known\nbad result and a known better implementation? File these on the GC. Maybe you&#x27;ll\nbe able to delete some optimizations in future versions. :)<p>The first version of Roslyn was 30x slower than the old C#  compiler written in C++. We&#x27;re now within 2x on 10-year-old hardware and beating it on newer. Perf optimization works -- but not all programming is a stroll through a park. :)",1410382232

Consider a (normal finite) list vs an infinite lazy list.<p>The standard pattern for working with data is to break it into smaller pieces, using pattern matching, till you hit a base case. In Scheme (hopefully close enough to CL you can read it; and not using pattern matching, but whateva) you write stuff like<p><pre><code>   (define (foldr f zero lst)\n     (cond lst\n       [(null? lst) zero]\n       [else (f (car lst) (foldr f zero (cdr lst)))]))\n</code></pre>\nWe break lst into smaller pieces till we hit the base case of the empty list. Classic stuff and everyone knows it.<p>Now what about codata? You can&#x27;t break down infinite data till you hit a base case, because there is no base case. It&#x27;s infinite! So you apply the Fundamental Theorem of Pretending You Understand Category Theory, and prepend co- to all technical terms in the description for data.<p>So if data is processed using pattern matching and recursion, then codata is processed using copattern matching and corecursion.<p>By a strange quirk of fate this actually makes sense. You can read more about corecursion (aka coinduction) on your local Internet, and I guess copatterns, as described in the post, are the next piece of the puzzle.<p>There is a slight analogy with setf but it doesn&#x27;t go very far.<p>HTH.",1410381669
8298998,comment,8297184,8297184,1,0,novalis78,,,"I think at this point it is pretty clear that the dramatic population decline in Europe (started late 20th century but has accelerated since the 60s) is not something that can be solved by money nor does it seem to have to do with life style choices (the first and second world war did not do much to change the overall trend[1]).<p>One fascinating book I read a couple of years ago compared Western European nations with each other vs the &quot;European counterparts that settled America&quot;, i.e. the Caucasians in North America. It&#x27;s interesting that in this particular comparison America (main difference: less social welfare, more individualism, more religion) still has the <i>highest</i> of all ethnic Caucasian birthrates approx. 2.4 [2]<p>One economist&#x27;s work that is very interesting to follow on this topic is Gunnar Heinsohn[3] who publishes his findings in intriguing essays usually backed by a lot of statistics and numbers.<p>But back to the article: the whole topic raises a couple of important fundamental questions: \nWhat do you mean by &quot;Germany&#x27;s&quot; birth rate plummeting? The population overall, of course, has been steady for the most part and was recently admitted publicly by the ministry of federal statistics (a few years back) [4] Germany itself will be a majority Muslim country by 2050. So the population itself will probably not change or not much, it will rather turn into a different cultural entity, one with a small and shrinking &quot;original&quot; ethnic group (similar to the Japanese, for instance) but being replaced by a (mainly) Turkish/Middle Eastern cultural group that will incorporate their own beliefs and traditions into the aging German society and probably eventually dominate it (it is, after all, just a number&#x27;s game).\nIt&#x27;s also not really a workforce problem as the article alluded - some here have already pointed out increases in productivity and automation that might offset these issues. The whole notion of population decline is inherently a cultural/ethnic question IMHO - even if a desire to shrink the population to improve the quality of life is your goal and immigrant birth rates fall over time: the fact of the matter remains this that you might be looking at a new &quot;Voelkerwanderung&quot; and all that comes with it.<p>Personal anecdote: I used to work for an IT company in Germany about 10 years ago - I had roughly 40 co-workers in an age-range of 20 to 40 (I was 25 at that time). I was the only one with 2 kids - nobody else had kids! Zero. My colleges had dogs, cars, expensive vacations and lived for the most part in those parts of town that shielded them nicely from the mass immigration taking place in what they called &quot;(immigrant) ghettos&quot;. The life style benefits were non-negotiable for most of them but left not much for kids either (taxation is tough if you have to fund healthcare and mass immigration :-). The girls were brought up to loathe the idea of being a mother (and all the single mothers at the edge of society were an effective warning sign). So they were all headed for their careers, making it near impossible to have their first child before the age of 30-35. Not much time left after that. The climate in the bigger German cities that attract all those young and bright Germans looking for work is quite detrimental to raising children as well: very often our experience was that kids were seen as nuisance (in the US we had quite the opposite experience which might be one reason for the difference in birth rates - the US provides (in many emotional daily interactions) a way more supportive place to raise children than Western Europe).<p>At this point, sadly, it seems to me that population growth is linked to (a lack of) education and / or religious indoctrination. It does not seem to make much of a difference when some European countries pump millions into their social projects to support families (Sweden, France) or when they do not (Germany, Britain) - the birth rate decline is almost the same for all of these countries (again, I am talking native population, not immigrants) [5].<p>Conclusion: Religion might be one(?) way that natural selection ensures a population&#x27;s continued growth - I like to be proven wrong, but I can&#x27;t think of a nation where the growth rate is high and Atheism and Enlightenment reigns the day. A positive outcome would be a gently declining population overall on planet Earth that becomes supported by automation and a growing population on Mars while leaving violent fanaticism in the past...<p>---\n[1] <a href=""http://www.trykkefrihed.dk/interview-a-continent-of-losers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trykkefrihed.dk/interview-a-continent-of-losers.h...</a> (could not find a better one, but there are numerous essays describing his theory of &quot;youth bulge&quot; on the web\n[2] <a href=""http://www.pop.org/content/fertility-decline-in-western-europe-1727"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pop.org/content/fertility-decline-in-western-euro...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Heinsohn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Heinsohn</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/german-population-plunge-irreversible-federal-stats-office-admits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/german-population-plunge-ir...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/07/MDII-graphics-webready-90.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/07/MDII-graphics-webready...</a>",1410381667

They see themselves as a Windows company, not a software/services company, even still, despite Nadella&#x27;s proclamation (which wasn&#x27;t sufficiently different from Ballmer&#x27;s when he took over). They have fallen into the trap where they see everything only as an opportunity to push the Windows brand, instead of products. They fail to see that the primary purpose for a company is to make money, NOT to simply chain the company to a specific product or brand. They&#x27;re always looking for ways to shoehorn &quot;Windows&quot; (where the definition of that varies from the OS product to just the brand name) into new products, which leads them to make bad products the market doesn&#x27;t want. Even Nadella demonstrates this by insisting everything must run on the same Windows kernel. XBox consumer don&#x27;t care, even the slightest, about the OS kernel in the unit. Nor do smartphone purchasers. Nor, fundamentally, do most computer users. All they care about is what can they DO with the product. Will it play my games/run my apps/run my programs? will there be a constant stream of fresh new content and experiences for it? If the answer is no, there is no amount of &quot;Windows&quot; they can add to save it. The XBox brand grew from nothing, with no visible link to Windows in its first form (although yes, it was based on Win2k) and the 360 was a completely unique OS, and was a huge success (aside from the hardware failure issues). This alone should have been proof that Microsoft doesn&#x27;t need everything to be Windows, but no, they simply planned on how to make the XBox One into a Windows box.<p>Windows (and DOS) built Microsoft, but Windows will also kill Microsoft if they don&#x27;t start looking at products instead of &quot;Windows&quot; of opportunity.",1410381636

The initiatives for such things tend to be concentrated in city downtown areas where there are many riders. Once you are out in the boonies, there tends to be nothing.  Often a piece of highway is the only realistic way to get somewhere, whether by car or bike.  It&#x27;s either that, or cut through a bush, corn field, or swim a body of water.<p>As we get away from the downtown areas, we still find bike trails, but more oriented toward recreation. They are localized into small areas and veer off useless places such as parks on the assumption that you aren&#x27;t going to work, but on a picnic (if you were going to work, you would obviously drive). The trails do not form a complete system to get from A to B; even if you use them as much as possible, you have to use regular roads to get from one trail network to another. Some bike trails are also simply not built for speed; you cannot just get on these trails and pedal all out at 30 mp/h.",1410381427

A person who is able to function constructively in society might have tendencies, habits, leanings, personality traits, or whatever word you want to use to describe the differences between people. But if they are functioning and not in distress, by definition they do not have a disorder.<p>That does not stop people from using disorder names as shorthand. &quot;OMG I&#x27;m so OCD about checking that my back door is locked!&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m pretty Aspberger at parties.&quot; Etc. But it&#x27;s important to remember that these are a casual shorthand, not actual diagnoses. People with actual Obsessive Compulsive Disorder do not laugh about it; they are in deep distress about it.<p>So: while we can talk about psychopathic tendencies, or use &quot;psychopath&quot; as a shorthand, people who operate normally or successfully over a long term in business are likely not afflicted with a psychopathic disorder. They might be ruthless, they might be hard headed, they might have lower empathy than average. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they need to weeded out, excluded, treated, etc.<p>The hard question is: at what point is not a normal and adaptive difference in personality, vs. a disorder that must be weeded out?

But all of engineering is about tradeoffs, so presumably there would have been some way to make traffic even better if they didn&#x27;t have to consider the fate of bicyclists at all. The authors seem to be portraying this as if it&#x27;s something of a free lunch (although obviously reengineering the road has some monetary cost), but it&#x27;s not. If they had spent that same money on an engineering effort directed solely at automobile traffic, they could have done better by drivers (again, presumably).<p>Of course, if they had actually drawn a lot of people to use bikes instead of cars thus reducing traffic, then it could be argued that engineering for bicyclists advantages drivers directly, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have happened.<p>1: The Seen is the result of the engineering effort that they undertook. The Unseen is the result of an alternative engineering effort with different goals.",1410380843

I didn&#x27;t ask them to get on the road with me, but I&#x27;ll sure as hell be held responsible for their decision if something happens.<p>If there were only cyclists on the road, the worst accident would be a few broken bones.  You chose to bring a potentially lethal device onto the roads, of <i>course</i> it&#x27;s your responsibility.  If I juggle chainsaws in a crowded plaza, I don&#x27;t get to blame the guy who bumped into me for flinging chainsaws into people.<p>> More importantly, as a tax payer, I&#x27;ve helped fund literally dozens of miles of really nice dedicated paved and marked bike only trails, complete with parking and overpasses, tunnels and signals at busy intersections. There is literally no excuse for them to play &quot;Tour de France&quot; on the same road I&#x27;m trying to get to work on.<p>Try it.  You might be surprised that these bike lanes have dead ends or obstacles or just astonishingly crappy terrain.<p>And don&#x27;t give me the &quot;taxpayer&quot; line, an <i>astronomical</i> amount of cash is spent on roadways and expressways over and above any gas taxes or fees.

Each time a pool is filled up it will do a GC cycle and only if there&#x27;s still no room for new object it will allocate a new pool. That means number of GC cycles in this situation is proportional to number of objects you allocate, while each GC cycle time is proportional to the managed heap size. It leads to quadratic complexity and awful slowness. If runtime allocated pools not of fixed size but adapted their size to the allocation rate, this scenario could be significantly faster.&quot;",1410380173

They shouldn&#x27;t be sharing the road with cars.<p>While I understand the sentiment you need to understand that cyclists are put in a pretty awkward legal situation themselves.  They exist in a no-mans-land between pedestrians and vehicles.<p>Sidewalks are often too narrow, too close to blind corners, etc for safety.  They&#x27;re often VERY bumpy.  At 2mph a sidewalk is fine, but at 15mph it tries to shake your bicycle apart.  Pedestrians don&#x27;t expect cyclists on the sidewalk and that can make for horrific collisions.<p>In the street cyclists get no respect.  Cars cut cyclists off making right turns regularly.  &quot;Dooring&quot; is a very real phenomena that can put people in the hospital.  Cyclists regularly get killed by cars and the drivers suffer no real consequences.<p>Here&#x27;s a NYT article on precisely this subject: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to-kill-cyclists.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to...</a><p>> pure safety concerns for the biker (who I as the automobile driver am responsible for in the case of an accident)<p>As you can see from the NYT article that&#x27;s often not true at all.  The police tend to look at cyclists the way you do, and many times don&#x27;t find fault with drivers even if cyclists are KILLED much less injured or have their bikes destroyed.<p>> generally shitty entitled attitude lots of bike riders seem to have (probably earned from dealing with irritated drivers like me)<p>A lot of the shitty attitude has to do with a constant fear of death.  Further cyclists are definitely treated as second class citizens on the road, despite being required to obey all traffic laws however ill-suited they are for pedal powered vehicles.<p>But if the law applies evenly to cars and bikes then cyclists have every right their three feet of roadway and possibly the WHOLE lane (depending on how wide the shoulder is and the lanes are) without fearing for their lives.  But often that&#x27;s not the case.  It makes &quot;sharing the road&quot; a very adversarial experience and worse is that cyclists can&#x27;t see who&#x27;s about to run them over, honk at them, swerve far closer than legal, throw something, etc because the cars are usually going faster than the cyclist.<p>The idea that bike riders have shitty attitudes and drivers do not is a non-starter.  The problem -- as you&#x27;ve stated -- is best solved by making dedicated room for cyclists rather than expecting everyone to just magically get along in situation which rewards neither for doing so.",1410380076

The fact that the city also added bike lanes at the same time does not mean that the bike lanes caused the speeding-up of car traffic (correlation != causation, and all that)...<p>Read from the source article that the OP references (and then glosses over):<p><a href=""http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2014/09/when-adding-bike-lanes-actually-reduces-traffic-delays/379623/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2014/09/when-adding-bike-la...</a><p>> <i>So what happened here to overcome the traditional idea that bike lanes lead to car delay? No doubt many factors were involved, but a DOT spokesperson tells CityLab that the steady traffic flow was largely the result of adding left-turn pockets. In the old street configurations, cars turned left from a general traffic lane; in the new one, they merged into a left-turn slot beside the protected bike lane (below, an example from 8th and 23rd). This design has two key advantages: first, traffic doesn&#x27;t have to slow down until the left turn is complete, and second, drivers have an easier time seeing bike riders coming up beside them.</i>",1410379733

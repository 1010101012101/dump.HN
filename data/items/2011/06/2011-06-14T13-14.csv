It is an iPhone app with a service attached to it (the editorial service) and I think it is important to say this because we are not selling an app in isolation.<p>Not really sure about what you mean when you say: 
""audio programmes from independent DIY audio makers"" sounds like sophisticated something.<p>Did you find this sentence confusing or do you think it sounds unnecessarily sophisticated? The intention is to give potential listeners an understanding that the content comes from independent makers as well as larger more well known broadcasters.",1308059748

See the disambiguation page on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-weight_process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-weight_process</a>. How very poor of whoever started misusing an existing concurrency term to refer to something else - as if discussing these matters isn't already difficult enough.<p>Could someone familiar with Erlang please clarify:<p>""To understand why this is misleading, we need to go over some background information. Erlang popularized the concept of lightweight processes (Actors) and provides a runtime that beautifully abstracts the concurrency details away from the programmer. You can spawn as many Erlang processes as you need and focus on the code that functionally declares their communication. Behind the scenes, the VM launches enough kernel threads to match your system (usually one per CPU) ""<p>In common Unix tools like 'ps' and 'top' the term 'Lightweight Process' is used as a synonym for OS thread, eg, the LWP column in 'ps -eLf' shows the thread ID.<p>In this article, LWPs seem to be different from threads? Is this correct?  If they're not threads, what are they?",1308059729

Maybe it is a fluke or maybe the timing could be off next time. I don't believe there is a a force that gives us a right to exist, a magical mechanism that makes us pull out ourselves out of any trouble. We have to do it ourselves.

2652934,comment,2652032,2652032,4,0,api,,,"This guy is ignoring the twin elephants in the living room: the unbelievably massive amount of energy that we obtain from fossil fuels, and the reliance on the modern financial system on continuous growth simply to maintain the status quo.<p>These are linked issues.<p>All fossil fuels will peak this century. It's not politics... it's physics. No amount of wishful thinking will change that. Actually, I suspect they will all peak before 2050. Many knowledgeable people think oil has already peaked.<p>Peaking doesn't mean running out, it means exponentially declining EROEI (energy return on energy invested). There's plenty of oil left, but when it takes a barrel of oil to get a barrel of oil we are out of oil.<p>Nothing except maybe nuclear has the muscle <i>right now</i> to fill the gap for electricity generation. Just try to sell that now, post-Fukushima. Nothing except biofuel can presently fill the gap for transportation, and it is dubious that biofuels can scale to those levels.<p>Does this mean apocalypse? I'm actually not a ""doomer"" per se. But consider this: as we pass peak on all fossil fuels, the vast majority of our surplus energy and labor will have to go to simply treading water and maintaining our standard of living in the face of rapidly declining energy availability. There's also going to be a lot of demand destruction: people buying less, traveling less, using less.<p>All that does spell doom for our financial system. Even a short interruption in growth results in financial catastrophe, since without continuous growth you get a wave of debt defaults.<p>It could be a very chaotic century.<p>Edit: but on the upside, there's going to be a ton of entrepreneurial opportunities around saving energy, making energy, and storing energy. Personally I think IT isn't where it's at... if I wanted to get back into entrepreneurship now (and I might in the future) I'd get into something energy-related.",1308059525

Instead of limiting sizes of political donations, just make it impossible to track who gave 'em. Oh sure, you can still <i>tell</i> your favourite politician ""Hey, I just gave you ten thousand dollars"" but they can't possibly check.<p>Closing a few obvious loopholes: you should only be able to donate in certain nice round numbers ($10, $20, $50, $100, ... $10,000, $20,000) to avoid situations where you can tell a politician ""Hey, the $15433.33 donation is from me"" and have them confirm it. And it should be fuzzy in time, too -- politicians shouldn't know <i>when</i> a donation came in with resolution greater than a week or so.<p>It's great, because people are still free to support their favourite politicians as much as they like, but with greatly decreased possibility for corruption.<p>Politicians will, of course, hate it, so it'll never happen.",1308059274

The idea was to put (then) current GCSE students through the old O-levels in a 1950s boarding school environment. It was of course (like any ""reality"" show) done up for TV but there were some interesting tidbits, which were news to me (as an expat):<p>- Grade inflation is rampant, so much so that they had to invent a grade above an A (the A<asterisk>) because too many people were getting As.<p>In the US I <i>believe</i> this to also be a problem but it's hidden behind scaling of results. At least I see so many people who have 3.8+ college GPAs (which, as I understand it, basically means 80% As and 20% Bs) that I have to wonder where all the C students are.<p>In Australia--at least when I went through the education system some 15+ years ago--it was nothing like that.<p>- Students who were getting 11 GCSE As couldn't pass 4 O-levels. Granted the curriculum structure is different (eg it once relied on more memorization) but still...<p>- Current education philosophy in the UK seems to emphasize creative expression, which to me sounds like the educational equivalent of moral relativism in that there is no wrong or right. The idea is to simply make students express themselves. Nevermind actually knowing anything or being able to critically formulate or deconstruct an argument.<p>- Students who were getting As in GCSE French couldn't even conjugate the verb ""avoir"" (to have). If you've never studied a language this means coming up with the French equivalent of I have / we have / you have / he/she/it has / they have (j'ai / nous avons / tu as / vous avez / il/elle a / ils/elles ont). This is as basic as it gets.<p>In case you were wondering why there was 6 for French and 5 for English, the second person singular in English (thou hast) has fallen into disuse.<p>From what I remember the exams were largely take-home translations, which in the Internet age typically meant getting someone French to do them.<p>- Maths was incredibly weak.<p>But the UK seems to have a similar problem to what Australia does now: a government who has treated the number of students in university as some kind of target.

North Dakota,</i> took place in 1992 -- before the internet era even began. Yet another instance of the government not keeping up with this whole ""internet"" thing and changing laws to reflect that reality.",1308058759

2652801,comment,2652032,2652032,1,0,Zakharov,,,"I think Lomborg's got a good argument in favor of a conclusion he leaves unstated (and may, in fact, not favor) - that some portion of the money governments would spend on sustainability should instead be spent on finding a proactive solution to climate change, e.g. extracting large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere.<p>Doing nothing and hoping someone independently solves the problem strikes me as an unacceptable risk; there is little market incentive at the moment to reduce environmental damage. A carbon-trading scheme would create such an incentive, but would no doubt create its own inefficiencies. Markets are great at dealing with resource shortages, for example whale oil, but quite bad at dealing with negative externalities, e.g. air pollution. It took government intervention to clean up London (I think? I don't have any sources on this).<p>Spending money on proactive solutions encourages economic growth instead of discouraging it, and can lead to future benefits as ""green technology"" leads to new advances. On the other hand, it's somewhat risky as most avenues of inquiry will lead to dead ends, and any geo-engineering technology that becomes widely adopted could have nasty side-effects.",1308057164

They have no qualms about stating that A-Level syllabuses are being dumbed down. Oxford and Cambridge maintain lists of A-level subjects that they do not recognise. Most of their prospective intake comes from independent, grammar and wealthier comprehensive schools with the resources and confidence to guide students towards the right qualifications (increasingly something other than A-levels) and coach them through application and interview.<p>Most other universities are engaged in a mad rush to the bottom, competing to fill the maximum number of places at the maximum fee at minimum cost. Their main appeal is to working and lower-middle class students who may not be confident in their ability to get a place at university, who are unlikely to have received any useful guidance in their application and who are foolish enough to believe that ""a degree is a degree"". Standards at secondary level are falling, as are contact hours at most universities. With a strong financial incentive to maximise intake, the results are obvious and inevitable.<p>The reputation of these universities is plummeting amongst employers, who are seeing increasing numbers of graduates and even postgraduates without basic skills in reading and writing. This is not hyperbole - I regularly deal with correspondence from recent graduates and often have to make follow-up phone calls because their written English incomprehensible.<p>Crisis is too mild a word for the current state of HE.",1308056879

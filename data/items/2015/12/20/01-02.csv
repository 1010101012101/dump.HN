10765718,comment,10762409,10765631,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"The authors in their paper propose a different approach to citing articles, which is to cite the article name instead of the author. This criticism, while humorous, is off-base from what&#x27;s actually being proposed.<p>This is not an example that the authors gave, but you might write something like &quot;On the Origin of Species (1859)&quot; instead.<p>This joke also misses the point in that a follow-up anonymous article would not, to match the author&#x27;s intent, reference the authorship of previous work. The whole point is for each article to stand on its own, so referencing yourself pseudonymously as the author of a previous article does not achieve the goal.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be &quot;that guy&quot; who takes the humor too seriously, but I worry from the comments so far that people will conflate the humor and the actual proposal. The overall aim and proposal of the article is to find a way for papers to be judged individually on their own merits, rather than on the merits of their author, the author&#x27;s institution, the author&#x27;s nationality, or the paper it was published in. This is a worthwhile goal even if we cannot see a serious means by which to achieve it.<p>To be fair to the jokes, while reading the article I was unsure if it was satire. I&#x27;m still not completely sure. I believe the authors are sincere in their belief in anonymity as promoting merit, but I remain unsure whether they think their proposal is realistic, and whether or not they are making some kind of meta-point about the state of scientific review by observing how far away the current review process is from one that would be (as best as we can make it) unbiased. That is to say, upon reading the paper, the idea of implementing their anonymity proposal seems ridiculous - and this realization may be partly the point of the paper, to get the reader to realize how many different points in the editorial process depend on the author&#x27;s identity rather than the material&#x27;s merit. It does not strike me as satire, because the work takes itself seriously, but it may seem like satire because of how large the gap is from where we are to a meritorious review system.<p>&quot;Ha! It would be ridiculous for work to be reviewed, published, and promoted purely on its own merit, rather than based on the legacy of the author.&quot;<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s hard to say how well a fully anonymous system would work. Human biases often serve a useful cognitive function in allowing some filtering operation to be performed more efficiently, albeit with less accuracy. A random lunatic who claims to have invented a perpetual motion machine is likely to be wrong. It&#x27;s possible that devoting equal review time to all claims and all papers would lower the sum value of scientific output. If the volume of scientific material is too great to comprehensively review, from any given observer&#x27;s standpoint, then a system that relies on identity as a heuristic and is slightly less meritorious may be strictly better than an anonymous system that is slightly more meritorious, for example. Society might have a different goal for the output of the scientific process, which is to maximize the discovery/promotion/publication of useful scientific output - and that is a different goal than judging individual work fairly.",1450576498

10765715,comment,10762409,10765557,0,0,dalke,,,"The paper isn&#x27;t suggesting &#x27;Anonymous et al. (2002, Nature)&#x27; style links. In fact, it addressed that concern directly:<p>> It is suggested that, if using parenthetical referencing,  we are not referring to the author(s) any more but to a few title-keywords of the article and do not refer to the journals name. Those title-keywords can replace the authors’ names completely. They can be chosen by the author(s). Taking the APA citation style as an example, citing Nosek and Bar-Anan (2012) could look like this: &quot;...how to change scientific communication (e.g. Opening Scientific Communication, 2012)&quot;. The full reference should then be placed in the reference section together with other bibliographies starting with the letter O. The latter can be applied to the Vancouver citation system, too.<p>I happen to think it&#x27;s not a useful solution, because 1) &#x27;chosen by the author&#x27; is a free-text field open to all sorts of ways to hack the system, 2) names are easier to transliterate than titles are to translate, and 3) citations are often not made because of the main topic of the paper but can include also minor points which are later found to be more important. Using the author&#x27;s name is a more neutral link in that case.<p>(For example, I&#x27;ve seen a paper cited because there&#x27;s a one line comment about the software used to make an image in the publication. That software became popular, but there was no publication about the software itself, so people cited that first paper instead.)",1450576277

The areas where animals graze in China are not densely populated, and not much of that meat is exported east to densely populated areas, at least when compared to pork (China&#x27;s most popular meat) and chicken (China&#x27;s second most popular meat); grazing animals are mostly limited to Muslim niche foods (well, not niche if you are Muslim!). Grazing animals have not had much effect on China&#x27;s population density (and if you think about it, the huge amount of land required to graze animals necessarily limits population density).<p>Jiangsu, a Chinese province of 79 million people, has twice the density of Japan, a country of 125 million.

10765712,comment,10765005,10765005,0,0,r2dnb,,,"Interesting, I used to give the same kind of coding exercise to candidates but was leaving them alone in the room for 60 minutes and popped-in every 20min to ask them if everything was fine.<p>I also kindly insisted on the fact that they should feel free to come see me if they had any question. The reason is part of the exercise was to assess their ability to avoid wasting their time by being blocked on something and ask for clarification.<p>On the one hand I like this pair interview approach because it allows you to check the communication and social skills of a candidate. On the other hand I don&#x27;t like it because you lose tons of valuable information.<p>You lose information on the autonomy of the candidate, on his creativity, on his coding habits, and more. You create a group effect (we&#x27;re not the same in groups that when we are alone). And to me, while team work is important, the interview is about gauging the individual contribution that the candidate will make to the team and in an artificial environment it is done more accurately by allowing time to assess his individual work skills.<p>I also knew that in the particular company I worked for, we didn&#x27;t do pair programming and we most of the time had to work alone on several mini-projects. So it made even more sense to assess how they would perform under their future work conditions.<p>I prefer my approach because you can get the same insight into their thinking patterns by reviewing their solution with them point by point afterwards, but you also get plenty of other information by doing so. I never focus on the syntax but ask questions on the strategy and the choices made. The code could even not compile I wouldn&#x27;t care, the only point of the exercise is to have material for a discussion.<p>The one important thing to hire good developers is to always have a coding project of 1 hour or so relevant to the role in the interview process. This revealed the bad developers instantly, and the frightening thing is that all of them had otherwise performed very well during interviews.<p>Thanks for sharing though, I didn&#x27;t know about this practice and it is always refreshing to know what other people do. While I don&#x27;t think I will implement this approach for the reasons mentioned above, having a broader perspective can only benefit the mind.",1450576040

The &quot;reporting&quot; database was my idea and my attempt to actually be able to do sometime &quot;cool&quot; there.<p>The java software devs, even though they all had 15+ years experience, really had no clue what a database was other than a thing to put data in. App environment configs, customer configs, binary images,... you name it and it was stuck in the main database. The schema was designed by a sysadmin that left shortly after the company (a start up) actually started getting real customers. Messing with the schema was basically off limits. No one saw an issue with it.<p>Everyone thought the schema was brilliant because that sysadmin thought it would be a cool idea to replace indexes with partitions (DB2 9.7 at the time had a brand new &quot;partition by range&quot; feature). He wrote giant bash scripts to partition many tables by timestamps on either a 15 minute, one hour, or one day interval AND by groups of account IDs (or any other ID that might be in the row). His logic was that even though all queries will do a full table scan.. but hey these are all really tiny tables now! Management and the senior devs thought it was a brilliant idea. It didn&#x27;t work so well in the end, and ultimately indexes were just added randomly all over the place. But the partitions remained and the scripts would run every hour... but sometimes they&#x27;d fail to add partitions because of locks. Which ultimately left no where for certain data to go (based on timestamps) and the app would go down.  This went on for years...<p>But the other issue, as time rolled on, when the schema did need to be changed, it was done the quickest and dirtiest way possible. One patch I saw go through added a &quot;username&quot; column to several tables to track what user made a change to a row, but it was varchar instead of a FK... completely de-normalizing the schema. No one knew or understood the data on the dev team.<p>I tried best as I could to do analytics, but the DB2 DBA&#x27;s were always on my case for &quot;accessing&quot; &quot;their&quot; database. I managed to get buy in from my manager to start standing up postgres databases for reporting. We tried Mysql at first but its supported SQL syntax was too butchered for anything other than simple queries.<p>The idea was to have a carbon copy of the OLTP schema in postgres and populate it with Pentaho or some other BI tools/scripts. Once that was mostly working we were going to build a data warehouse schema with stuff in the proper formats so we could just query without having to transform. Sadly after a few months my manager moved me off of the project and put a rather new contractor over the project who knew nothing about data architecture, or linux (he constantly complained about the command line and would say things like &quot;I stopped using DOS years ago&quot;), or even postgres. I was moved to simply help with some vmware upgrades which was boring. They then opened a &quot;jr DBA&quot; position and filled that with someone straight out of college to handle standing up the postgres instances.<p>And with that, I left.... and eventually most of the rest of the team too.<p>PS, they are looking for a BI guy...",1450575396

She may very well be a megalomaniac, but these assertions should at least have vague anecdotes (&quot;A former employee recalls a 2008 incident in which Holmes fired a senior engineer in a Reply-All email after he replied that he didn&#x27;t think the machine could be finished on deadline.&quot;). The judgment of what is simply pointing out a problem is sometimes context dependent. And nothing else in the story mentions other proof that would affirm that Holmes is a power-freak when it comes to being the CEO. Yes, there are plenty of anecdotes of her being headstrong in negotiations and attempting projects and deals that went nowhere, but that&#x27;s a different thing than being a vindictive charlatan among her own employees. The NYT sat down with her for a 2.5 hour interview and could have at least confronted her with this and given her a chance to deny it. In contrast, the WSJ, who couldn&#x27;t score an interview, had actual anecdotes [0] (the hearsay of one of Theranos&#x27;s chief engineers, who had claimed the technology was a fraud before committing suicide, and emails about fudging the FDA tests).<p>The parts about her pre-Theranos life were similar to the New Yorker&#x27;s story from last year [1]...it sounds like she was the real deal in terms of being a passionate engineering student. It makes me wonder if she had spent at least a couple more years beefing up not just her engineering experience, but life experience, that some of the poor CEO decisions she&#x27;s made would have been mitigated.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-bloo...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler</a>",1450575193

She often spoke as though the company’s technology already existed, they said, rather than as if it were still in development.</i><p>Funny how that works. I&#x27;m just getting into the book <i>Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction</i> by Tetlock and Gardner and came across this passage:<p><i>Galen is an extreme example but he is the sort of figure who pops up repeatedly in the history of medicine. They are men (always men) of strong convinction and profound trust in their own judgement. They embrace treaments, develop bold theories for why they work, denounce rivals as quacks and charlatans, and spread their insights with evangelical passion.</i><p>So even if Theranos is a complete flop, Holmes may still prove a groundbreaker in her hubris. Tetlock and Gardner sum up the problem by quoting Richard Feynman:<p><i>What medicine lacked was doubt. &quot;Doubt is not a fearful thing,&quot; Feynman observed, &quot;but a thing of very great value.&quot; It&#x27;s what propels science forward.</i><p>Less so, I guess, visionary entrepreneurs.",1450575166

Young fertile women have clearer skin.  So that&#x27;s the goal.  To get there women want to ether cover over blemishes (the painted woman image of the op) or basically peal off a layer of skin to expose the more youthful skin underneath (the &quot;natural&quot; look popular today).<p>a) Anything that peals of skin chemically, rather then abrasively, is going to be toxic.  The high PH of the ammonia dissolves fats and oils ... ie living tissue.  Google &quot;chemical peel&quot; for today&#x27;s version.  But dissolving skin is a very localized injury without long term side effects.  You can wreck your face, but ammonia isn&#x27;t going to give you cancer.<p>b) The painting-over approach requires something that can sit on the skin for a period of time without either dripping or being absorbed into the skin.  You need something that can block light when spread in a very thin layer.  And it needs to be shelf-stable.  So you are looking for metal  compounds, the heavier the better.  If you want white, that&#x27;s lead or zinc oxide.  Lead is cheaper.   Its toxicity, its general eagerness to play havoc with all biological reactions, keeps it from rotting away in the jar.

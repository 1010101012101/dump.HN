677524,comment,677439,677469,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Because it has a bunch of buttons that are irrelevant, which basically add too much unnecessary visual ""noise"" to the page.<p>Between the slideshow and the video, I would suggest going with simple screenshots of the control panel and a short summary of what the service is. Then have a separate longer page that explains features in a bit more length, and also have detailed description available in the Documentation section. Currently, the page simply has ""too many characters"".<p>Also the color scheme should not be white on dark. This is purely a perception thing. You are pitching clarity, reliability and simplicity - the color for these is white.<p>Also the page looks a bit sloppy layout-wise. The ""exactly"" from "".. showing exactly what .."" actually sits on top of the slideshow.<p>The ""NOW"" part from ""Try out monitoring <i>NOW</i>"" sounds tacky. Also the dark-on-gray is not a very good color choice for an action button. It's gotta be bright and it should look visually pleasant.<p>The ""WIGS"" is effectively another source of the noise that detracts from your primary service. I would consider renaming it into something a bit more human-friendly or taking it out completely. The same goes for ""security videos of the academy"" link at the bottom. Why the heck would I care about some academy.<p>All in all, the site needs to be simplified and streamlined to focus on just one thing - your primary service. The service itself appears to be valuable, but (a) it's going to be a tough sell (as its value is in detecting abnormal conditions, i.e. its value is not tangible under normal conditions) (b) make damn sure it respects robots.txt, because otherwise with a one-minute polling interval you will be blacklisted in no time.",1246165126

677522,comment,677409,677437,0,0,Scriptor,,,"I also feel that biology requires a different mindset from those who would rather go into physics or engineering. Back in high school I would always excel in biology while one of my friends would excel in physics. On the other hand, it took much more work to also do well in the other's field.<p>Although some complain that biology is more about rote memorization, I've found that that works only if you want to pass the test. Understanding something like gene->protein is much more interesting when you try to understand the context and reasons for everything. It's hard to explain, but I get the impression that biology requires a stronger understanding of how large systems work, while physics requires a strong ability to manipulate and refactor situations to solve problems.",1246164887

Suppose pack A is full of extreme non-depressives and B is depressive. Highlander style, only one male in A will survive while B can maintain a back-up stock in case accident befalls the alpha.<p>That said I don't see why the gene expression couldn't be:<p>if (alpha) {
   act like alpha

   act depressed

677512,comment,676056,677234,0,0,grandalf,,,"Interesting question.  Keep in mind that for most of human history it was challenging to just <i>get enough calories</i>, so the question of figuring out the optimal diet is a fairly recent development.<p>And, per the line you mention, the established view at the time was that the cure for worldwide malnutrition, etc, was to figure out better ways of producing protein.  This was actually what TCC was trying to do initially in his research before he discovered that animal protein causes health problems.<p>Notice that today everything is marketed as a health food.  I was watching TV earlier and saw a commercial for ""Sunny D"" that essentially sells it (yucky orange flavored sugar water) as a health food :)<p>One note:  The first bit of the book is a bit sensational, but stick with it -- the claims are all nicely substantiated.",1246164088

I used to have a debit card only, but it's a bit scary: whoever steals your debit card number (or the card itself) has direct access to all money you have in your checking account.  If they steal your credit card number on the other hand, then (a) they can only get up to your limit (which I keep low) and (b) you can challenge the bill and not pay and you are protected by law in some way.

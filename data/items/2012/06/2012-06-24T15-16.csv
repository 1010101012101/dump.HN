It's a toy, that could maybe have a game built around it.<p>Stuff that might make it interesting off the top of my head:<p>- moving things for the 2D guy to avoid/collect
- moving things for the 3D viewpoint to avoid/collect
- switches for 2D to throw that remove obstructions for 3D, and vice-versa
- sometimes you having to move 2D and 3D at the same time<p>The biggest thing for me that I can't think of a workaround for offhand is the constant breaking of flow. The video shows you doing like 3 seconds of platforming followed by a context shift into 3 seconds of FPSing.<p>Hopefully the students behind this have thought of all of these things and many more.

A company doesn't have to be horrendously expensive to set up, and can even be dirt cheap in some jurisdictions like the UK. If the idea fails, so long as the company isn't otherwise insolvent it can be reused or even kept dormant for the price of a decent lunch, ready for the next idea.<p>The thing that bothers me about this pre-incorporation experimentation phase is liability. This advice would lead to a window of personal liability in the beginning for the founders. Although I'm not used to the same level of litigation risk American entrepreneurs face, incorporation in any jurisdiction can (in most cases) serve as a really cheap form of legal liability insurance.<p>I also wonder (and this will be highly dependent on the jurisdiction) whether the founders will be liable for their pre-incorporation actions. For example, if they write software that infringes on someone's patent, would incorporating later ease their personal liability for the time before the business was incorporated and IP rights were transferred to the company?",1340553328

Honestly this is barely changed from the default android UI. You repackaged the widgets so they're on their own page which you could already do. You added a shortcut screen which can hold both widgets and apps and contacts which is the same as any regular Android screen and you put the apps on one page like the launcher. Changing the way the lock screen looks with swiping is cool but that's not all that special.

That's what QE is all about: from the perspective of the private sector, QE is equivalent to the government creating money out of thin air to pay back the debt. This is only obfuscated a bit by the fact that treasury and central bank have separate balances.<p><i>Why borrow when you can print?</i><p>My guess is a combination of (a) most people are afraid of change (case in point: you), (b) the people owning treasury bonds effectively get a hidden subsidy via the interest paid by government, and (c) the problem is framed in such a way that most people never even question the existing institutional arrangement - and when they do, they tend to do it in terribly uninformed ways.<p><i>No such thing as risk-free debt.</i><p>Please explain under which conditions the US government would become unable to fulfill the promises implied by its debt.",1340551560

The system does not want to give full access to the site with a lot more potential harm, so if a customer visits one of these automatically classified sites and sees it is restricted, they can submit a classification at which point an employee will verify the classification and unlock the full site. Sometimes the restrictions are bizarre, such as allowing the HTML content to be viewed, but not the CSS. This process takes up to 24 hrs. From what I've seen, these automated classifiers are not always friendly to hostnames tacked onto a domain name (e.g., fsf.org/donate would probably be better than donate.fsf.org). They also routinely prevent visiting new domain names thrown up in Show HN posts until the URL is submitted for classification and gets whitelisted.",1340550393

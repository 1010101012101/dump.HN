I would weigh myself in at the same time - in the morning, before taking in any food or drink, but after taking care of the bodily needs.
I never had the need to count the calories, so I have absolutely no idea what my calorie intake was while losing weight compared to normal diet.

You don't need a 10/1Mbps connection to send highly-compressed voice, and even as 4G is rolled out, the networks are not going to decommission their 3G equipment.  (Consider GSM, where you have HSDPA/UMTS, EDGE, and GSM all as the ""same network"".  WiMax will supplement CDMA, not replace it.  And I assume the idea is to move bulk bandwidth from CDMA to WiMax so that the CDMA network has more call capacity.)",1273554360

People move onto the new yearly release quickly to get updated rosters. I don't think a $10 fee is going to improve that situation at all. It will likely make it worse. The people who do spend $10 are going to be very disappointed to find out few people are playing a -1 or -2 year old sports game online anymore.

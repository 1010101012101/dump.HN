78848,comment,78588,78643,0,0,ajju,,,"The only thing India is a leader at right now is developing outsourced software and services. I agree we need to see more finished products coming out of there. One of the reasons this doesn't happen is (I think) you can't develop a product while sitting thousands of miles away from your customers. You need a local market for whom you make the product and then if it's good you can export it. The local market in India for most types of software is still small (but growing).",1194897366

Here's the C&P'd response I left on his blog:<p>Thorough writeup, Tom.<p>I'm curious as to where you got all your data, though.<p>Steve and I were indeed the only two people using the site when we started it (aside from a few friends we begged) but we were submitting&voting under multiple usernames only for a couple weeks. Once we got a link from a PG essay, we started seeing some traffic -- people who did a much better job than we ever could at finding interesting content.<p>Your ""80% for many months"" figure is incorrect. If you could provide the source, I'd be happy to contact them to correct this inaccuracy.<p>Otherwise, you've got a pretty spot on piece. Thanks for writing it.",1194897217

Just in the last week there have been two articles on news.yc about how ""experts"" in every field are much more likely to be people who get average scores on various intelligence metrics like IQ but worked harder and longer on the same problems.<p>If you would like a more authoritative source that backs up this claim with extensive research take a look at the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise.",1194896667

The fact is, everything can be changed once a term sheet is signed, so negotiating on the finer points of it may be overkill.</i><p>This reminds me of <a href=""http://www.negativland.com/albini.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.negativland.com/albini.html</a>  :<p>""These A & R guys are not allowed to write contracts. What they do is present the band with a letter of intent, or ""deal memo,"" which loosely states some terms, and affirms that the band will sign with the label once a contract has been agreed on. The spookiest thing about this harmless sounding little memo, is that it is, for all legal purposes, a binding document. That is, once the band signs it, they are under obligation to conclude a deal with the label. If the label presents them with a contract that the band don't want to sign, all the label has to do is wait. There are a hundred other bands willing to sign the exact same contract, so the label is in a position of strength. These letters never have any terms of expiration, so the band remain bound by the deal memo until a contract is signed, no matter how long that takes. The band cannot sign to another laborer or even put out its own material unless they are released from their agreement, which never happens. Make no mistake about it: once a band has signed a letter of intent, they will either eventually sign a contract that suits the label or they will be destroyed.""\n",1194896601

So any niche that can be, will be filled by a meme before our biology changes.<p>You are right this wouldn't reverse pre-existing stuff. But what pre-existing things were there? Reflexes? Check. Face recognition hardware? Check. High level human interpretations of touch? No.<p>You say memes are a top layer. That's what I said originally! And I made an analogy you have not answered: Ruby is a top layer, on top of an assembly language, and C. And the fact is, if you switch to a platform with a different assembly language, Ruby stays the same. The lower layers aren't important once you abstract them away.<p>You say we have a ""primate brain"" but aren't clear on what this means. We have a brain with <i>universal</i> creativity. No (other) primates have that. It's a different kind of thing.",1194896242

I dont know how they can expect to build their own Linux platform to compete with Andriod... I hope they embrace the open handset alliance rather than try to define their own standard.<p>",1194895440

Some folks are comfortable with the idea of certain traits being hard-wired by evolution and/or God (depending on the person).  Others seem threatened by the idea of an existence over which they do not exercise full control -- as if to ask ""what meaning can be derived from such limited opportunity for self-actualization?""<p>I'm in the first camp.  Sometimes I have some anxiety over my existence, but (as a Christian) it usually revolves around questioning whether or not I am living the right kind of life.<p>One thing I do know is that worrying does nothing to help the situation.

I have known this about me for sometime. I had this thing about people. What ever you admit, you admit it because you are proud of it. Like for eg. I am always busy - yeah, you are proud of being busy. Or to bring the point out, one of my friends admitted to me that he suddenly realised that he was arrogant ( a BBM himself ), subconsciously he is proud of being arrogant.<p>My simple question: Does it have to be like this ? I mean, being Brilliant and a failure. C'mon guys, failure sucks. Big time. If you don't feel that, you don't have a problem. But if you do, consider this. Lets turn this inside itself in the true spirit of Lisp. Being BBMs we can come up with brilliant solutions to 'cope up with brilliance' while avoiding failure. Can't we ? Stop being proud. That's the point where it Starts. Post any coping mechanisms you have discovered over the years as reply to this thread. Thanx.""",1194894009

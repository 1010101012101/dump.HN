Paul's essays really struck a chord with me.. especially 'Why nerds are unpopular'.<p>I've been programming since a young age and I used to love making little 3D graphic demo's in QBasic.

It's an opportunity for them to see how you think.  They're hiring you to solve problems - and the easiest way for them to gauge problem solving ability is to ask you to solve problems.<p>""Would you want to work with the guy who builds a water-displacement scale/barge, taxis a 747 to the docks, and then weights the jumbo jet using that, instead of simply calling Boeing in the first place?""<p>Umm, just because you CAN solve these brainteasers doesn't mean you don't know how to call Boeing!

162715,comment,162680,162690,0,0,smalter,,,"yes, the cult of paul graham reminds me of people who worship ayn rand. her writing gives people a sense of power, that they can transform the world with their will & determination. paul graham's writings/personal story empower in the same way. although, like rand, it's unclear whether the characters in their stories have real world referents or portray a world closer to (an empowering) fantasy than reality.<p>(this post makes no judgment as to the normative value, good or bad, of creating empowering fantasies if that be the case.)",1208134027

Hands up if you got accepted to YCombinator without applying.<p>As in the open source world, Paul Graham's influence is in proportion to what he gives away. He spends time packaging his ideas into forms that others can benefit from, and he asks for nothing in return. Call it open source business planning.<p>There are other people that give away ideas, too, and they all have influence disproportionate to their personal success, think Joel Spolsky, ESR, et al. However, none of them have the passion to help their fellow man succeed that Paul Graham has, so they all tend to be treated as second-tier gurus.<p>PG cannot be compared to other ""success coaches"" either, because he does not seek personal gain for his ideas, only return on his investments. You get the feeling that he does not have ulterior motives in his writings.",1208132328

The mobile acquisitions really have yet to pan out. I wouldn't be surprised if this is more or less the story with GC. Google is desperately trying to become a mobile player, but it's unfamiliar territory and probably a money loser at the moment. It's like they're acquiring these companies with shotgun style without really planning out their future integration.",1208132109
162690,comment,162680,162680,0,0,mixmax,,,"Even though the question (imho) is a bit awkward it is interesting. And since there is clearly a following around PG it is a valid question to ask.<p>I think the reason is that he resonates well with a large group of people (hackers) that are smart and able, but are often very introvert. They often don't get the credit they deserve, are bored with the typical business and corporate stuff that they find simple and shallow, and don't understand why they don't get to where they want to be, and why the world is as it is if you are intelligent and introvert. Paul Graham is extremely good at putting these feelings into his essays and giving hackers a hope that they are something special, and that maybe it's not them that are doing it all wrong but the world.<p>I read a comment here some time ago that stuck: A guy felt disilusioned at the world and typed the word ""why"" into google (true hacker style I might add) and PG's essay ""Why nerds are unpopular"" came up in the search results. This essay, and many like it, give meaning to a lot of people that find youtube, myspace, and Fox news to be below their intellect and don't understand why nobody in this world seem to be able to think for themselves and have their own opinions.<p>That's why.",1208132085

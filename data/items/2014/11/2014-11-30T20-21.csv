George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, and the commercial interests of Larry Silverstein, the developer with a controlling stake at the site, among other forces pressing for a mid-20th-century complex of glass towers surrounding a plaza. Stripped of prospective cultural institutions, as well as of street life and housing, the plan soon turned into something akin to an old-school office park, destined to die at night — the last thing a young generation of New Yorkers wanted. In retrospect, had 1 World Trade been built last, after the site was coaxed back to life (and yes, many added years later), a very different project might have evolved.<p>So you and the author of the article are talking past each other: you&#x27;re saying the building is a fine, elegant solution that fulfills the requirements stated, and the author is saying it&#x27;s an ill-suited building because the initial requirements were bad in the first place.",1417381073

Starbucks --> broaden your horizons and explore the world of &quot;grind your own.&quot;
Eating out more than once a week --> eating out once a week, and preparing healthy meals the rest. Sometimes having your friends over for dinner. 
Gym membership --> enjoy looking for new kettlebell and bodyweight exercises that you can do at home. Go for walks with your wife in the evenings, or incorporate walking/exercise into your weekly date.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that overseas travel is one area where I still overspend, so this would fall into the &quot;sacrifice&quot; category if I were to cut back. Even so, the skills in frugality that you learn while working your day job are useful on overseas trips. Haggling while jostling with old ladies at a wet market (in a language you don&#x27;t understand) in order to buy ingredients for breakfast and a packed lunch is an experience that many travelers will miss out on.<p>(full disclosure: last holiday was a &quot;relax by the hotel pool/private beach&quot; affair.

8678032,comment,8677483,8677743,0,0,krapp,,,"Hacker News is already loaded with features designed to engineer good behavior - the reply rate slows down in deep threads in order to discourage flamewars. The text in text posts is dimmed to discourage &#x27;blogging&#x27;. The moderators will change titles and tweak the weights if they feel a popular post is too controversial. There&#x27;s a moderation queue which lets high-karma users preapprove comments in certain controversial threads, and threads with more comments than votes get auto-flagged. Slowbanning and hellbanning are designed, respectively, to annoy users into leaving and render their pariticipation irrelevant. You can downvote and flag - and downvoting even comes with a handy visual censor, making the easiest form of engagement with a downvoted user to downvote them further (and the most difficult to actually read their comments.) And I even think downvoting by high-karma users counts more. And yet, trolls exist here as anywhere.<p>Heck, lobste.rs goes even further. It&#x27;s an invite-only community, and like the mafia, if anyone you vouch for turns out to be no good, they get whacked, and you get whacked. And yet you can find downvoted and low-quality comments there as well.<p>I think that putting friction in front of new users tends to do more harm than good. Although I have seen a number of forums which moderate a new users&#x27; first five or so comments, even then, it doesn&#x27;t keep trolls out altogether, it just delays the inevitable. Proactive solutions tend to fail more than reactive ones. Don&#x27;t feed the trolls, downvote bad behavior, flag bad threads, upvote good threads, good behavior and engage with other users in a civil and productive manner.<p>>I suspect more than 50% of mundane comments would disappear.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with &#x27;mundane&#x27; comments per se.

And it&#x27;s actually worse than that - the reported inflation in the US (CPI) vastly underestimates realistic costs of living. I would assume that&#x27;s true in Germany and the rest of the world as well.<p>Officially, it is 1.7%. However, that includes hedonistic adjustments (you can buy a TV now for $70 that is equivalent to a $2000 TV from 30 years ago; therefore, $70 today is worth $2000 of 30 years ago; weighted by the relative part of your expenses that go towards buying TVs), &quot;owner equivalent rent&quot;, which is a speculation by a sampling of home owners about how much rent they would have paid to live in their own house (are they over estimating? underestimating?), some measures ignore food and energy costs (who needs either?) and other shenanigans that make the numbers easy to manipulate on one hand, and impossible to reproduce on the other.<p>Unless the majority of your expenses are technology related and unchanging (you still happy with your Apple ][ performance, right?), the CPI is probably closer to 5% per year for a while now.

I figure if there&#x27;s something really important that&#x27;s happening, it will show up in my newsfeed on Facebook.<p>But I definitely try to avoid routine.  My family is always trying to get me to settle into one -- a predictable pattern that&#x27;s followed every day -- but I&#x27;m actively trying to avoid doing that.  I recall reading once that having a (boring) daily routine is the quickest way to make your life fly by.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s true or not, but I&#x27;ve found that it seems pretty accurate for myself.<p>In addition to not having a routine, I try hard to stay open-minded.  I&#x27;ve noticed that as most people become older, they become very opposed to anything that doesn&#x27;t fit the worldview they&#x27;ve developed over the decades.  It&#x27;s almost disturbing to them on a psychological level if you challenge some strongly held notion about the way the world/reality works (and I&#x27;ve mainly quit trying.

like it.  For the problems described in the OP, I&#x27;m
not encountering those!<p>I want to write relatively simple code, thus, want
to avoid tricky features of the software tools I
use, and so far have been successful.  But this
desire means that I don&#x27;t have deep experience with
tricky aspects of OOP.  So, YMMV.<p>So far mostly my code looks just like it would have
before OOP; I&#x27;ve created only a few OOP <i>classes</i>;
and all of those are simple.  I write a lot of
functions but not many classes.<p>Some things I do like:<p>(1) Can have an array of classes and, then, can sort
the array with whatever class <i>properties</i> want to
use as the sorting keys.<p>(2) Can <i>serialize</i> an instance of a class to a byte
array, send the byte array via TCP/IP, and
deserialize the result.<p>Well, the OP notes some of the dangers of
<i>inheritance</i>.  I agree and saw the danger right away
and, thus, in the code I write try not to use
inheritance and so far have been fully successful.<p>But, I can think of situations where inheritance
could be useful and keep the work better organized
than not using inheritance.<p>But, I&#x27;d say:  The main issue is just having humans
understand the code, and for that, using inheritance
or not, the main solution is just to document what
is going on.<p>Or, if the way around using inheritance is just
having multiple copies of the same source code, then
just document this fact so that when want to change
one of the copies, likely change all the others,
also.  And, of course, generally should know all the
places in the <i>code base</i> where that code, or some
modification of it, is being used.  Can solve such
an issue with just documentation.<p>Or we don&#x27;t want to look to programming language
syntax and features to solve all problems of
<i>meaning</i> in that software, meaning better
communicated with documentation.<p>Gee, so far this is a <i>polymorphic</i> post since I
didn&#x27;t way what OOP language I&#x27;m using!  So, I&#x27;m
writing in Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic .NET with their
.NET Framework, ASP.NET (for Web pages), and ADO.NET
(for using SQL Server).  That Microsoft software is
awash in classes, and that <i>architecture</i> seems to
be working well.<p>Yes, that Microsoft code is awash in inheritance,
but mostly I just ignore that fact and regard it as
more just documentation than actual software.  I get
by mostly ignoring inheritance because I don&#x27;t use
it directly in my code.<p>In my project, the hard technical work was the
applied math; it turns out, given the math, the
corresponding code is simple.",1417379964

8677986,comment,8676872,8677728,0,0,vardump,,,"Sure high performance generic JITs are not simple.<p>NOTE: Following is meant for dynamically dispatched lightweight methods, like those that just read (or compare) or store (or modify) some simple field value or do other simple operations where dispatch and call frame setup costs dominate. In inner loops which are executed enough many times that the codegen overhead is less.<p>The rationale is that branches are very expensive on modern CPUs, especially indirect subroutine (= method or function) calls. Consistently 14-20 clock cycles lost in addition to whatever time call frame setup takes, pushing and popping registers from stack. If inner loop cost is otherwise just a cycle or two and the dispatched method is trivial, it&#x27;s easy to see how branch mispredict and call setup costs can dominate. In some cases some unrolling and prefetching could be done in addition.<p>In this case I envision routines that fuse (inline) dynamically dispatched (function pointer, message passing, pattern recognition) method inside a loop. A compiler could generate the rules and runtime system can do the actual composition. The method would then be dynamically inlined within the loop. No call, no function pointer call (=vtable), no full pattern recognition, no message dispatch, etc. Just fused, inlined code.<p>Pattern match can&#x27;t be completely resolved early? Just generate code inside the loop that does the rest of the work with tests and branches. Try the most likely case always first (may require some profiling). Same with other dynamic dispatch.<p>Many cases, but known exponential distribution of probabilities? Inline some most likely cases, dynamically dispatch the rest. Like before, most likely first and some profiling may be required.<p>This way very expensive (data dependent) indirect function call is avoided. Call frame setup and teardown is avoided. The savings can be an order of magnitude for short dispatched methods.<p>Definitely no complete virtual machine needed.<p>Note: Edited multiple times.",1417379696

The reason a single bond keeps you from losing your principal is because it has a declining duration, whereas bond funds generally have a fixed duration (more or less) since maturing bonds in the portfolio are usually reinvested into bonds of the same time to maturity.<p>You can simulate the behavior of a single bond by rolling your investments into shorter and shorter duration bond funds over time. The reason you would do this is if you have a known date for when you are going to need the principal. (This is the same justification you would use for buying an individual bond.) By controlling the duration via reinvestment into bond funds, you are diversifying away a majority of of the default risk (<i>the</i> major risk of owning bonds) while still being able to ensure your bonds are worth at least as much as your principal on a fixed date determined at the beginning of the investment.<p>As an aside, concern about the market price of a bond is usually a good example of focusing on the wrong thing. If a bond&#x27;s price has declined because of increased default risk, this is obviously bad. But if a bond&#x27;s price has declined because of increased interest rates, this means you will be able to re-invest the coupon at a larger yield, so depending on your investment goals (such as having a robust inflation adjusted income stream for retirement) this may not be strictly a bad thing.<p><a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Individual_bonds_vs_a_bond_fund"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Individual_bonds_vs_a_bond_fu...</a>",1417377955

Matter and energy are the same thing-- Einstein put that together with E=MC2;  Space and time are the same thing. Einstein put those two together also with his theory of General Relativity and gravitation. Now whatever you look at you see it in the past  (the light that carries the information has to reflect from an objects surface to your eye and that takes time.) You can&#x27;t see anything when it happens. If you look at it from the point of view from Einstein&#x27;s equations, the separation between you and what you see is always zero. You see things away from you in space by a trick of seeing backwards in time. You see the sun 8.5 light mins away by seeing it 8.5 light minutes ago.  This what Indian philosophy calls Maya or illusion and maintains that space and time are mental concepts. Dobson terms Einstein&#x27;s equations as the &quot;Equations of Maya or Illusion&quot; <a href=""http://www.mystacki.com/#!/binder/41/john-dobson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mystacki.com/#!/binder/41/john-dobson</a>",1417377903

It&#x27;s always on the verge of being superseded by this, or disrupted by that, or supplanted by something else, but it never really happens, and IRC continues to chug along, doing what it does best, independent of any one company or hot new technology.  It may not always be the most beautiful thing out there, but it is rugged.<p>IRC was one of the first things that got me excited about the Internet - I was studying Italian at the university, and realized that I could actually communicate, <i>in real time</i> with people on the other side of the planet, <i>for free</i>, back in 1993.  I was utterly amazed by this.  At first, I figured the people in the chat room (#italia) were BS&#x27;ing me and must just be Italians that lived in the US or something.  A few years later, I managed to meet several of them in person when I moved to Italy for the first time.<p>Today, among others, I hang out on #startups on Freenode.  It&#x27;s not a very &quot;serious&quot; channel like some of the programming language ones are, but it&#x27;s fun and interesting sometimes.",1417377899

Like, in iOS or gtk or QT or whatever, there are stock widgets (buttons, sliders, text boxes), but you can also add your own widgets, like a date picker. A date picker would be modeled completely differently from those other widgets, and so it needs a completely different data structure.

This is an important problem because complex organisms appear to be created by some &quot;random&quot; process that organises what appear to be self similar cells.<p>A lot of recent work has been done to experiment Turings ideas on &quot;reaction-diffusion&quot; processes describing morphogenesis in biology and other natural systems to see if a) they can be reproduced in the lab and b) mathematically model them.

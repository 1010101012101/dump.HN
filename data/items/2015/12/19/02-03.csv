They&#x27;re already aggressively doing that in the classic stealth way, with currency debasement. The problem is, that approach is going to take decades, which ensures a non-stop erosion over that time. It would be drastically better to do it all at once, and to then get on with rebuilding while they have a larger working population. And while they&#x27;re at it, reform the government that got them there to begin with so it doesn&#x27;t happen again. There&#x27;s no scenario where they can ever pay back their national debt, and payments on it are consuming a very large portion of their budget. If they take the long road, it&#x27;s going to be a really bad 20 years at least, as their current problems are going to get far worse.",1450493333

Amazon reduced the need for warehousing but seemed to have become totally dependent on other companies for logistics. For long time they benefited from tax breaks and users willingness to wait few days for packages to get delivered. With price matching offered by several other retail stores, and Amazon thinking of starting their own retail stores, it makes sense to invest in their own logistics as well. I guess they would like to differentiate themselves in the long run as a ship-to-door retail company with excellent customer experience.",1450493129

These are icons that are part of a shared language, so it&#x27;s safe to say that using them will be instantly recognizable, despite the fact most people don&#x27;t use floppy disks or landlines anymore.<p>If a company decides to use a new icon that&#x27;s not easily recognized, it&#x27;s like trying to introduce new language; it has to be done smoothly, otherwise most users will not understand what it means. This is not a problem unique to icons; it&#x27;s a problem across languages.<p>If I had a new command-line tool that, instead of `./cmtool --verbose`, I implemented `./cmtool --consult` or `./cmtool --magicify`, you&#x27;d have to `man cmtool` in order to understand what the commands mean. This is because &#x27;--verbose&#x27; is a flag that&#x27;s common oft-used enough to be understood, generally, what it means, while &#x27;magicify&#x27; or &#x27;consult&#x27; are ambiguous and rarely used. This confusion has nothing to do with the nature that the UI is text-based (vs. icon-based), and everything to do with the fact that user interfaces, like a language, involves shared conventions.",1450492418

That said, not everyone develops depression following a major life stress - people have different levels of &quot;endogenous&quot; stress resilience/susceptibility. &quot;Endogenous&quot; stress resilience can be modulated, however, by &quot;exogenous&quot; interventions. For example, resilience can be increased by behavioral stress inoculation or even exercise, and it can be decreased by things like sleep deprivation or illness. It can also be partially inherited (i.e., if someone&#x27;s parents were &quot;exogenously&quot; stressed, the offspring can inherit lower levels of stress resilience through &quot;endogenous&quot; epigenetic changes) (2).<p>And though 80% of initial depressive episodes may be <i>triggered</i> by stress, this tight correlation between stress and depression does not persist as strongly after the first depressive episode. Essentially, once someone has been depressed a first time, they are then &quot;endogenously&quot; more susceptible to subsequent episodes of depression.<p>So, is it exogenous or endogenous? Long story short, in most cases, it&#x27;s both. Even if it doesn&#x27;t start as both, it becomes both. And both &quot;exogenous&quot; and &quot;endogenous&quot; contributing factors interact in an on-going dynamic process.<p>1. <a href=""http://hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu/pubs/05stressand.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu/pubs/05stressand.pdf</a>\n2. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26410355"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26410355</a>",1450492407

Its not particularly important. Its really just pointing out that monad is a very general abstraction - it wont tell you anything you don&#x27;t already know about Lists.<p>On the other side, lists as kind of trivial examples of monads - they didnt really help me understand monads either.<p>Its like saying 1 is a real number - true, but it wont help you understand real numbers.<p>2. Why should i use monads?<p>A: I like to think of monads as things you can use in a for-comprehension (or the do notation in Haskell). If you can imagine writing something like<p><pre><code>  for {x <- thing; y<-thing} x + y\n</code></pre>\nfor &quot;thing&quot;, then &quot;thing&quot; might be a monad (assuming all the math laws work out - sometimes they don&#x27;t). In scala, for-comprehensions are literally de-sugared into maps/flatMaps/filters so for comprehension without filter <=> monad.<p>3. But a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors?<p>A: There is deep category theory and math behind this stuff. It can be useful to talk about it, but when you are starting out its overkill. Don&#x27;t worry about &quot;getting&quot; the really abstract crap at first, just skim right over. Programming in monads is a lot easier than the theory, and the theory can be learned after getting your hands dirty. Using monads is mostly just for-comprehensions.<p>ps:<p>&quot;monoid&quot; = there is a zero, and an add operation. like integers with +, or integers with *).<p>&quot;functor&quot; = thing that has a map() operation.<p>&quot;endo&quot; = self<p>&quot;category&quot; = kind of like a set. its a container.<p>So a monad has a &quot;zero&quot; or default monad, a way to add monads, and a map operation that returns another monad.<p>e.g List -> zero = Nil, add = append, map = the &quot;normal&quot; map with f applied to each element<p>Future -> zero = empty Future, add = do future2 after future1, map = make a future with the f applied to value",1450492346

UX means usability, UI is the more aesthetic side of the exercise, though of course there is considerable overlap.<p>Part of the issue - at least from my corner of the industry in mobile app dev - is that a lot of good UI designers have renamed themselves UX designers - because UX designers are in greater demand - but are poorly qualified to actually assess and design for usability.<p>There are also more and more designers crossing over from other design disciplines - graphics designers and print designers are often transitioning to UX design and the results are not always good. To some degree they can bring fresh ideas to the table, but often it results in a lot of designs that aren&#x27;t competent at a usability level.<p>> <i>&quot;If a significant portion of your user-base is computer illiterate, which will often be the default, it does well to UI to the lowest common denominator.&quot;</i><p>I agree with the gist of what you&#x27;re saying - but I think there needs to be a bit more nuance here.<p>We&#x27;re no longer in the 90s, the userbase for most websites and apps largely <i>are not</i> computer illiterate. They are in fact quite technically savvy overall - the issue isn&#x27;t that your users are technologically ignorant, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re not skilled in <i>your software</i>.<p>If you look at the modern smartphone user they have a <i>lot</i> of learned expectations and behaviors and they know full well how everything works. The issue comes only when you try to break the established knowledge and do your own thing - which is exactly what the blog post here is about, icons that aren&#x27;t universally established and have vague meaning to non-experts (and even some experts).<p>One of the hardest things as frontend people is retaining the first-time-user mindset. You use your own software day in and day out and become experts at it, and your designs and considerations start swimming around that - you are more inclined to build power-user features and implement power-user shortcuts, and you gradually lose the ability to assess your own product from the perspective of a new (or even old, but irregular) user.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that people are technologically illiterate, but that they are not specialists in a very particular expert-user UI you may have designed.<p>This is made worse when designers start openly egging competitors&#x27; UIs, so now not only are you pursuing a confusingly non-standard UI, but this non-standardness starts becoming a meme in your specific niche.<p>The distinction is important IMO - with the exception of a few demographics (retirees?) it&#x27;s actually pretty safe now to expect a reasonable amount of tech savvy from your users, but you have to recognize what <i>you</i> think is universal trained user behavior vs. actually widespread user behavior.",1450491548

You generate a synthetic spectrum starting from a histogram of zero crossing intervals that has been &quot;smeared&quot; back into a continuous signal with Gaussian peaks by applying a kernel density estimate. The result can then be passed through the HPS to find the fundamental.

If the straight simply becomes an arc of a circle, the lateral centrifugal force (see xkcd) goes instantaneously from 0 to maximum. One might think an Euler spiral, whose rate of turn increases linearly, would fix this; but now, although the lateral force increases linearly, the onset of change in force is instantaneous, and is felt as a jolt by passengers. Apparently it is possible to create turns giving a smooth ride, but requires sophisticated dynamic models that are presently beyond me.<p>I started making a game with very smoothly transitioning banked turns, but it&#x27;s a lot more complex than I thought! (Other games use tilting-like mechanisms, such as suspension, and the natural averaging over the four contact points of a car, but that&#x27;s not applicable to what I want to do).  If anyone has some pointers, I&#x27;d love to hear them!<p>P.S. Re trains: Of course, another problem is that banked turns are &quot;static&quot;, the same for all trains regardless of velocity; whereas the &quot;dynamic&quot; tilting can adjust to current velocity, on-the-fly (in addition to smoothing out transitions). The rail camber/cant can remain suited to the typical velocity of non-tilting trains using the same track.",1450490654

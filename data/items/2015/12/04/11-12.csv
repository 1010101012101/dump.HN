It&#x27;s a cheap and convenient way to manipulate women into feeling safe regardless of whether they are or are not.<p>Obviously my mood affiliation differs from Atwood, but can anyone tell me if I&#x27;m missing any important point in his article?<p>And if I&#x27;m not mistaken, this argument seems to apply equally well to banning Telegram, pornoscanning people getting on airplanes, and similar things.

10675812,comment,10668687,10675480,0,0,david-given,,,"C is notoriously painful to parse with a parser generator because it&#x27;s not context free --- consider this statement:<p><pre><code>    foo * bar;\n</code></pre>\nIt can&#x27;t be parsed until you know whether foo is a type or a variable --- indeed, depending on the implementation, it can&#x27;t even be tokenised correctly. So you need hooks from the symbol table back into the tokeniser/parser. I&#x27;m not at all surprised that the author&#x27;s using a hand-written parser, as it reduces the problem space considerably.<p>(There&#x27;s a really good article which I&#x27;ve been trying to find which goes into details about all the weird parsing edge cases due to the rules about exactly when a word goes into the symbol table which I&#x27;ve been completely unable to find...)",1449230367

I guess tptacek meant that Signal might have less control over you than Telegram, but that&#x27;s a different issue from what I was thinking of.<p>Both Telegram, Signal¹ rely on a central server to which all users connect.  If that server goes up in flames then nothing will work for anyone.  Or if those who run it turn out to be evil or otherwise doing bad things then there is nowhere you can go without losing all your contacts.<p>But in a system that has multiple servers that talk to each other, like email and Jabber/XMPP, you have a choice in who provides the server while still being able to talk to everyone on the network.  So then it is at least possible to switch to another server or provider and still be able to reach your contacts.  It is also possible to run your own server, or convince your more technical friend to run one for you.  This model is called a federated client-server model.<p>A true serverless peer-to-peer system would in theory be even better, but in practice it is much harder to build and maintain, especially on mobile where devices may lose coverage at any time.  So for example Skype (before Microsoft bought them) would promote some clients to &quot;super nodes&quot; which other clients would use to communicate ... kinda like having servers but with less control over who they are.<p>(Note, I work on XMPP software so I&#x27;m kinda biased)<p>¹ There appears to exist server software but it is unsupported and might not be useful for more than talking to yourself.",1449229394

Since the behaviour of the Universe depends on its contents (i.e. we can gain information about the contents by observing the overall entity), this coarse-grained simulation is forced to sub-divide into smaller regions. The simulation keeps subdividing (some regions more than others) until it reaches a level where some hard-coded criterion is reached that further subdivision will have no effect on the outcome. For example, if an entire planet is getting swallowed by a star, it is not useful to simulate each atom of the planet; just treat the whole thing as one entity.<p>Unfortunately, the simulation has to spend a lot of resources simulating part of the Milky Way galaxy, because it contains a chaotic mechanism of &quot;life&quot;, which may cause an observable effect on the Universe as a whole, e.g. by seeding galaxies with star-engulfing, self-replicating megastructures. In the region around Earth, the simulation was forced to sub-divide to a level we might call &quot;classical mechanics&quot;, in order to calculate outcomes with enough precision.<p>Unfortunately, during the 20th Century, more subdivision has become necessary, as &quot;life&quot; has begun performing &quot;experiments&quot; with a precision beyond that of the &quot;classical mechanics&quot; level. These experiments act as amplifiers, turning very small effects (such as the discrete nature of space) into large ones (such as the publication of scientific papers, development of technology, colonisation of intergalactic space, etc.).<p>It turns out that the Universe is written in Haskell, and a &quot;print&quot; statement caused a thunk to be forced ;)",1449228544

Charities are not good enough; you need to disconnect the incentives for writing the stories from how readers like them. News, after all, is about observable reality so it shouldn&#x27;t be affected by the moods of the society.<p>Yeah, BBC may be a step in the right direction. The grant-funding organization idea is interesting. Or maybe the reverse? Let&#x27;s make news just like a public agency - collecting data (stories) and releasing it as a public service, just like NOAA does with weather? But then again, we&#x27;d need a way to incentivize the reporters to dig into government/whoever-funds-this problems and make sure that such reports get published as well.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem, and alternative solutions won&#x27;t be perfect either, but the current situation of constant outrage-fueled brainwashing is taking a heavy toll on the ability of our society to reason, so IMO it&#x27;s worth considering a change.<p>BTW. I think that a regular change of such systems may not be a bad idea. The problem with media, or with justice, or democracy, or even with markets start when they&#x27;re getting <i>too</i> optimized, and thus start to deviate from the original purpose. So i.e. if you look at the arguments about <i>why</i> democracy is awesome and all, they all seem to make sense... if applied to the system from 100 years ago, back when it wasn&#x27;t so thoroughly gamed. We want our systems efficient, but not <i>too</i> efficient, because they&#x27;re not <i>perfectly</i> aligned with our shared values.",1449227768

I&#x27;ve experienced the justice system in both England and Scotland (they&#x27;re different!), from the Scottish perspective as a police officer and the English one as a member of a jury on two cases.<p>In both instances the lawyers who practice, especially in more serious cases, need &quot;a right of audience&quot; - that is they are either an English barrister/Scottish advocate or a solicitor who has undergone additional training. For a case like a murder trial both sides will have solicitors who appoint experienced counsel to actually make the argument in court. This is the key that the American system doesn&#x27;t have - those counsel almost always act for both defence and prosecution - they are not professional prosecutors or defenders. Some specialise in one direction or the other, but they avoid the tribalism and chasing of conviction rates. There is the equivalent of the DA, that is the senior state lawyers who rarely actually appear in court, but they come up through the tradition of the independent bar.<p>What that leads to is a prosecution and defence that both tend towards the interest of justice. Given that you end up with the professionals all striving to test the burden of proof, not grandstanding - which leads to a more harmonious jury experience. Many of my friends from university became lawyers, some of the brightest minds in the country practice at the criminal bar and conduct &quot;legal aid&quot; defences - i.e. act as public defenders. It is the equivalent of the defence attorney in the article&#x27;s case being a Harvard Law graduate.<p>No legal system is perfect, many are starved of funds, every one has had prominent scandals over the years. I would submit that the jury system is still a valuable check and balance and works remarkable well when combined with an independent, professional, bar which avoids perverse incentives.",1449227335

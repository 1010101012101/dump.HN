587712,comment,587640,587640,0,0,AndrewO,,,"This method has been the bane of my existence for going-on 5 years now.  YMMV, of course, but here's my experience:<p>Back in 2004, we were decided to denormalize a set of records containing year, quarter, and 15 or so data points going back to 1996.  Using this cross-tab method, we started out with 8 (years) * 4 (quarters/year) * 15 (data points) = 480 columns (a few more for non-denormalized data).  5 years later, we're up to the high 700s.  Needless to say, this pretty much blows out your standard MySQL admin tools.<p>Another pitfall is, you really have to make sure you data is pristine (of course you should be doing that anyway, but reality is usually far from ideal, especially if you're me in 2004), otherwise you end up with doubling of values or values included when they shouldn't be.  The generated queries are very very difficult to debug, again blowing out many admin tools and also text editors (unless you add pretty formatting in your query generator).<p>So what would I recommend instead?  There are multi-dimensional databases or ETL tools that will properly put your transactional data in an analytical style data warehouse.  Read Kimball's Data Warehouse Toolkit [1] (ignore the kinda ratty paper quality—the content is good).  The key thing is to denormalize down to a star schema, but keep your facts and dimensions separate (things you'll learn in DWT).<p>There's an Java based OLAP server called Mondrian [2] that also may be worth your time.  I ended up going with ActiveWarehouse and ActiveWarehouse-ETL [3], but I've felt some things a little more complicated than they needed to be (but that's another discussion—and I haven't kept up with their development lately, so it may have improved).<p>On a side note, recently I've started wondering if map-reduce style tools would make sense in this context, but I haven't explored using them that way yet, so I can't actually make a recommendation there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Complete-Dimensional/dp/0471200247/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241130825&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Complete-Dimens...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mondrian.pentaho.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mondrian.pentaho.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://activewarehouse.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://activewarehouse.rubyforge.org/</a>",1241131672

The belief that two people spending money and effort to keep at odds with one another is beneficial and furthers advancement more rapidly than collaboration seems broken. With all of that waste, I can't understand how anyone at the funding agency can say they are getting the most return on investment following this strategy. A more collaborative model would give them the dual benefit of not having all of this in-fighting waste, while at the same time benefiting from the super-linear growth in results by having two people bang heads together. I sense a sacred cow here.<p>As for how it can be done, what about allowing funding agencies to grant money to something akin to a research project trusts or foundations; something that spans multiple individuals and even multiple institutions, so the lines don't have to be drawn so sharply on who can participate and who can't. Something like the foundation model several OSS projects have adopted, perhaps.",1241131638

587709,comment,586953,587658,0,0,chadmalik,,,"Yes but simulating the brain will never be the same as the actual ""wetware"" in operation. To my understanding, the simplistic reason that hard AI has failed and always will - while it uses digital computation as a platform - is that its a HARDWARE deficiency.  I'm generalizing but AI people all seem to be algorithm gurus who feel that the next algorithmic breakthrough will be ""the one"" to create an AI.  I think what they miss is that the physical manifestation of brain and body are in fact required to be conscious.  Disembodied consciousness cannot exist since conscious beings (animals) have complex biological systems known as bodies that enable what we view as intelligence.<p>Yes, computers are infinitely better at rule-based computation than animals. No, they cannot pass simple tests of consciousness that a mouse can, and theres really no prospect of it happening because a better algorithm is created; fact is, animals and even insects don't think based on algorithms.  Algorithms are models of the real world, not the real thing.<p>Being conscious means using ones eyes/ears/mouth/nose/skin to feel, hear, smell, speak to interact with the world around you.  It means having agency and not just checking a set of pre-written rules in order to decide what to do next.  Its a biological system that enables that.",1241131557

587698,comment,587518,587668,0,0,drawkbox,,,"True but on the flipside just because someone is young doesn't mean they will provide more value.<p>One thing that is interesting about this article is that it was written just as the internet/web boom was happening.  It is important to note that a whole slew of industries and job tracks have been created since then.  It is also very important to note that software development really wasn't a field until the 70's.  So what we have is a young industry, thus younger people in it.<p>The age of someone that started development young in the early days of the web (mid-90s), let's say 1995, would be approx 32-33.  Anyone older than that had to come into web from pre-web industries, thus lacking in ability to change and learn to someone coming in clean.  But nowadays an industry really was born around the late 1990s that will get older and more skilled, as well as seeing young come in, at least in terms of web based development, game development and other recent web industries.<p>It would be like when radio started where people getting into it were young, as time went on it wasn't about age but skill and value.  Same will happen with software or web development.  Young will always be a key factor in software and web development but the position of the industry in time gives it a skew that appears ageism is more rampant.  This article was even more lodged into a time where hardly anyone knew the web would change the world and grow fields and industry as much as it did.  At this point the people that were going to go into marketing, radio, tv are now all going to the web.<p>So really, I agree it will be up to providing value and innovating but we will see the industry, especially the web industry, mature to where it isn't just the young running it.<p>I would say a prime is after someone went to school, and programmed for at least 8-10 years.  This is when programmers start becoming efficient and product developers.  The earliest that could happen for most people is late 20's early 30's.<p>Also, the best programmers are efficient and have a business and marketing edge.  If you have that you won't need to work as long because you will be creating the companies and providing the programming jobs to old and young, or rather just skilled workers in the newest industry that is transforming all other industries.",1241131154

But, the amount of uranium required is dramatically less, so far fewer humans would be needed for mining it.  The sheer volume of coal required is a big part of the problem, and the processing of coal produces other opportunities for people to get hurt or killed.  Uranium processing could also be dangerous...but again, the volume needed is much lower.<p>It's just a numbers game, really, when it comes to direct and indirect deaths and injuries, and we'd all love for there to be a completely safe, completely clean, completely free source of energy...but that's not an option.  We have to choose amongst the candidates we have available.  Nuclear wins in pretty much every category over coal.  And, since solar and wind power are not yet feasible for a majority of the US, moving to nuclear is the best option in many cases.  I'm not saying nuclear is perfect, but nuclear is certainly dramatically better than coal.",1241130682

I had the same stuff happening during my meditation but I didn't find it to be all that notable. Yes, after several days you begin to isolate tiny little sensations (like weak electric current) all over your body. It's really just that and nothing more though. I guess I question the value of that particular experience - is it really such a huge revelation that practicing a small task over and over makes you better at it, sometimes enabling you to do things you didn't think were possible?<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, I feel like people don't give enough credit to the experience of forcing yourself to keep a position in spite of searing pain. I am preparing to give birth soon and one of the exercises for pain management is to practice relaxed breathing while squeezing ice cubes in your hands. It's painful but also incredibly empowering to learn that pain can be overcome, and unlike meditating for days to achieve a few weird sensations, it's a practical skill.

1102756,story,,,16,29,yankeeracer73,"Ask HN: What should Microsoft do to get its mojo back?",,"The recent NYTimes article has generated plenty of discussion about Microsoft, most of it negative. But instead of focusing on what they've done wrong, I'm curious what people think they should do to gain back some of the relevance they've lost. And please, no ""Fire all the management"" comments. Here are a few ideas to start the conversation for better or worse:<p>1) Streamline the product line. Get out of the markets where you've just gotten in from being panicked. This largely means the content businesses and probably music. Stop being so fucking insecure about businesses where arch rivals are doing well and identify markets to get in to where you already have a natural advantage. This probably means other business markets vs. consumer. Bing seems to be doing pretty well but it should just be a hobby. Just going through your main nav on Microsoft.com shows you're spread WAY too thin. There's over 100 products on there.<p>2) Redo your website and come up with a consistent look and feel for everything. Your branding totally needs to change to give people a new vibe about the company. For the amount of money you spend on marketing, your website sucks. Fire whoever is in charge of it and start over using some boutique firms in New York or S.V.<p>3) If you can't outright cut projects/products, spin them off and give them their own identity. McDonalds owns Chipotle but you wouldn't know it from Chipotle stores, their focus on organic meat, etc. Given the polarization of your brand, this could work well in other areas.<p>4) Invest in some yCombinator/TechStars type incubators and create a more well known pipeline to the startup community.<p>5) You generated a ton of bad karma by keeping IE6 around for 8 or 9 years. Seems silly, but you lose a lot of cool points and generate a ton of frustration among the developer community you're trying to woo. Make sure future versions of IE rock, maybe even go to a webkit rendering engine instead of what you've got now.<p>6) Flatten the organization, introduce some perks not even Google has and publicize the hell out of them. Encourage more employees to blog and be open about the culture there and the good aspects of working there. Make Microsoft a cool place to work again.<p>7) Put up a pirate flag a la Apple in the eighties or some other rebel move for show. You need to look like you have an edge to put your competitors on notice that you're still the 800 lb gorilla in the room and you intend on kicking some ass once again.",1265345902
1102755,comment,1097723,1101825,0,0,apotheon,,,"> Well also Lisp macros are more comprehensive. Ruby can only make DSLs that look mostly like Ruby. In Lisp, you can literally drop in a new parser if you really want to.<p>Much better.<p>I haven't worked much (almost at all) with macros.  How easy/difficult would it be to create a Ruby-esque DSL in Common Lisp?  I'm just curious.<p>> This allows you to inject whole new programming paradigms into your code. If you need a special kind of OO, you can easily create it. This is actually incredibly-hard-borderline-impossible to do in Ruby.<p>Really?  I dunno, I've seen (for example) some really interesting functional paradigm idioms implemented in Ruby, such as a lazy evaluation module.<p>> Especially when you get into anaphora injection and complex closure manipualtion.<p>I admit I haven't done ""complex closure manipulation"" much anywhere.  I do use closures from time to time in my code, in a number of languages -- including Ruby.  I'm not entirely sure how ""complex closure manipulation"" would look, actually, so I have no basis for comparison in that regard.  I guess I'll just have to take your word for it.<p>> I had the same reaction this morning when a teenager asked me, ""Okay so I get pointers. I get what they are. But they don't see good for anything in the real world."" If you find this offensive or dismissive, I apologize.<p>I don't find it offensive or dismissive.  I understand your perspective.  I just don't think it helped anyone understand anything.  I'm sure it all looks a lot more natural to someone who has done a lot more CL and Scheme coding, but it really doesn't to someone who has pretty much never touched a CL or Scheme macro in his life (or even for me, who has touched them a little).  In fact, what Lisp macro experience I have is <i>mostly</i> limited to UCBLogo plus a light sprinkling of R6RS.<p>> I am simply saying that I think you and I are operating at entirely different levels of abstraction, and bridging that gap is difficult for me.<p>That's understandable.  To some extent for my benefit, and even more so for the other guy's, I decided to explain some of where the gap lies -- so that you might find it easier to bridge.  I hope.",1265345858

I know Django and I still strike out at getting Django projects pitched at $65/hr. But I think it has mostly to do with the economy.<p>Once you want to cross a certain threshold you need to have more structure in place as a business (with project rates and lots of time spent coddling clients and doing documentation), some really specialized and in-demand skills  or a long-running career with some impressive success behind you.<p>I've pulled in $100/hr+ in the past, but it was due to a complete package of project management, design and creative direction and oodles of documentation and meetings etc. Operating almost as a shop, not freelance<p>I don't know who all these folks are that claim they're getting $125/hr rates but I suspect they have more up their sleeve than just run of the mill web programming.

It seems this is the clincher that appears to absolutely terrify the publishing industry, but if it can't be done it reduces the value proposition for eBooks substantially.<p>Sure, there's still corner cases like it's much easier to store/carry/access/organise an eBook library than a paper book library, and delivery is intrinsically much faster, but I can't help thinking it's a huge fail on the part of the eBook market if they can't also push the massive production price per copy advantage they have.<p>Oh, and as an addition to that, region locking availability of eBooks is extremely frustrating as a consumer, but I assume that this is something the publishers are also forcing on Amazon? I bought Programming the Universe yesterday via Amazon, it initially wasn't available from Australia, but as I'm moving to Tallinn in a couple of days I just changed my address on amazon a little ahead of time and it immediately became available.

He would be the first to say that his predictions at a granular level are often wrong but that his methodology is a decent way of understanding how the world works and what might happen next.<p>Anyway, he states that the current war in Iraq (and perhaps Afghanistan) (against the ""Islamist Jihadists"" as he calls them, revealing more about his politics than is necessary) is not going to be a priority for the next 10-20 years. The primary purpose was to destabilize the region, not win the ""war on terror"", which certainly seems to have worked.<p>The next conflict, as he sees it, will be with Russia as it once again tries to gain greater access to the Atlantic, becoming another global power with access to both oceans.<p>I'm not well-informed enough to do more than repeat what I've read so far, but it is a thought-provoking thesis.

1102706,comment,1101659,1102459,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Zero, unless Amazon implements advances. The time inherent in writing a book is immense, some best selling authors only manage 1 entire book inside 3 years, whilst some are rather prolific with multiple titles inside a year. You're never going to attract anyone's attention, even paying high royalties, if you can't pay them for their time in advance.<p>The real issue is though that self-publishing means self-everything. Advertising, marketing, cover design, distribution; everything. You're turning a writer into a contractor, they either have to do everything themselves and take forever, or they have to sub-contract. As most writers are writers by choice it seems, quite frankly, moronic why <i>anyone</i> would think they'd want to be anything else. It took <i>years</i> for most authors to ever get published, so why would they ever accept a deal that meant they'd only spend 30% of their time doing what they wanted? They had that when they were doing a real job.<p>This isn't even concerning the major fact that all the talent is in the publishing industry already. Authors aren't going to be able to release the brilliantly edited books that are well marketed, distributed in multiple countries and often in multiple languages, with artistically designed covers. Doing all of those to a professional degree is as lucky as shooting yourself in the head and having no brain damage whatsoever despite a visible hole through your brain; I believe walking on water is more frequently reported.<p>Simply put a mass self-publishing route would inevitably end up with everything been done by the publishing industry, now retitled as the 'self-publishing' industry that takes an 85%-90% cut of your book sales. Only this way, you don't get an advance and you'll likely have to pay the 'self-publishing industry' thousands to get them to cover all the work in advance of any foreseen profits.<p>Essentially authors have the choice between the publishing industry where you can get paid anywhere between ~$5,000 and $2 million to write a book. Or you can choose 'self-publishing' where you'll likely have to pay a minimum of ~$50,000 to get quality editing, distribution, cover art and most costly of all marketing.<p>With $10,000 being an average advance in the industry for a first novel, who's going to pay $50,000 potentially for nothing? Especially considering that if you go with the industry, if your book doesn't sell a single copy they're out $90,000 plus the $10,000 they gave you and you are legally entitled to keep.<p>Right now the publishing houses don't buy out the first electronic publishing rights from the author or the electronic republishing rights. It's only going to be a matter of time before they do, which means authors advances will increase accordingly. If the publishing industry takes on the similar 70/30 to the author, then the advances could potentially increase dramatically if e-book sales really take off. However, again, after editing and marketing, this would likely be closer to 30/70 to the author.",1265343694

I don't know what your current strategy is, but hypothetically say you're primarily getting your work from Craigslist.  You're generally going to get mostly cheapskates that way.  If clients were coming to you because you were identifiably the best in the field and they felt We Are Willing To Pay For The Best, then they'd be offering rather substantially more.<p>2)  Its fine to describe yourself as a PHP/MySQL programmer when you're with friends like us.  Never talk like that in front of a client.  You aren't a PHP/MySQL programmer -- that is just the tool you use to <i>solve the problems that keep them from making stupid amounts of money</i>.  Code monkeys are cheap, people with strategic vision/soft skills/industry expertise/etc who also have the ability to knock together a DB when required are <i>expensive</i>.<p>3)  In service of #1 and #2: get a blog if you don't have one already.  Start solving the problems that people who have money have.  They'll soon start coming to you with their problems and offering you money.<p>4)  Some folks have already mentioned OSS contributions here, which is great if you want to brand yourself as The Man to do X.

1102689,comment,1101508,1101810,0,0,drags,,,"The tradition of unrestricted Senate debate has been a part of the Senate since the inception of the republic. In fact, prior to 1917, there was no mechanism for ending debate so long as any single senator desired to speak. And given that Congress used to meet much less frequently than it does at present, it was commonplace for bills to be ""filibustered"" simply because a single senator didn't like the bill, and other more pressing bills (read: supply bills) needed to be taken up before the end of the session. The idea of making someone speak in order to stop debate from ending was even more ludicrous than the idea of waiting out a filibuster (which in itself was ludicrous); it just wasn't even considered as a rational tactic. (For more on the circumstances of this, I would recommend reading Caro's excellent biography of Lyndon Johnson: specifically the third volume ""Master of the Senate,"" where he discusses in depth the South's effectiveness at stopping bills from coming to a vote circa 1957).<p>As for cloture, in its original incarnation (remember, this was only quite recently: 1917) it required 16 senators to file a petition for cloture, at which point 2/3 of those present and voting needed to vote in favor to lead to a vote. However, presiding officers consistently interpreted this Rule as NOT applying to ""motions to proceed to consideration of a bill,"" which are necessary by Senate Rule (from I don't know when, probably since Jefferson's Manual) for making a piece of legislation the main motion. As a result, if you didn't like a bill, you could still always just filibuster the motion to proceed until the late 50s/early 60s when this loophole was closed. Since there were 3-4 votes between the motion to proceed and the final vote on the issue, a group of 10-20 senators (say, the Southern bloc) refusing to allow a bill to come to the floor was more than enough to kil lit.<p>My point is this: the notion that the filibuster is a recently parliamentary invention ignores the 80-some-year period from 187X to 1957 when not a single bill related to racial injustice was passed into law at the federal level. To my knowledge, ""the South"" was never even in control of 1/3 + 1 of the seats in the Senate chamber, but they <i>still</i> managed to effectively use Senate Rules and precedents to restrict these bills from coming to a vote, and I can't think of a single congressional session during this period that was extended to try to outlast opponents of a bill. It just didn't happen.<p>Today, at least, you can a) get to cloture vote, since the motion to proceed loophole has been closed and b) stand a reasonable chance of succeeding at the cloture vote, since you only need to convince 3/5 of the Senate that something is worth voting on. If there is more technical filibustering right now (by which I suppose one means defeat of cloture motions), then at least there is a public denouement, rather than a policy of simply giving up when a handful of senators express opposition.<p>===<p>Also, two asides:\n1. Thurmond's 1957 filibuster only occurred because he wasn't backed by the rest of the Southern Caucus. They chose to allow the bill to come to a vote, presumably because they knew that Lyndon Johnson (majority leader) needed a civil rights bill in order to be a plausible presidential candidate, and they really really wanted a Southern president.<p>2. The idea that the Senate Rules are readopted every session has never really been accepted by the Senate. Nixon was the first presiding officer to rule as such in 1953 (it may have been 1955) as part of civil rights strategy, but it was overruled on that occasion and on most later occasions. In general, I would say that the prevailing sentiment among Senate parliamentarians is that the Senate is more of a continuous body, and I would expect a real struggle if a majority ever attempted to pass a new set of Senate Rules under the supposed ""normal parliamentary rules"" under which the Senate debates at the beginning of each session.",1265342997

No wonder Microsoft appear to have badly stagnated.<p>Microsoft have changed a lot since 1995. They moved into the mobile space with Windows CE and Windows Mobile. They moved onto the web starting with software like Internet Explorer, Outlook, IIS, Windows Live Messenger and moved onto websites such as MSN, Hotmail, Multimap, and, more recently, Bing. They moved into hardware and released the Xbox, Zune, Zune HD, Xbox and Xbox 360. They moved into online gaming with Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live, which have evolved into social networks and marketplaces for both these products. That's ignoring all the different major changes to Windows-related technologies, whether .NET, DirectX, Exchange, Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center, Windows Search, Windows Firewall, or Microsoft Security Essentials, which have all changed beyond recognition or outright didn't exist back in 1995. Hell, Microsoft have even made a standardised video codec called VC-1. There's probably others, but that's much more than ""nice fonts, widgets, and ... nice shadows here and there"".<p>Were these products innovative? Some definitely were (Xbox Live stands out), some weren't especially innovative but had advantages that caused them to compare favourably to their competitors to gain significant marketshare (Xbox, Internet Explorer, DirectX, .NET, Windows CE, Exchange, IIS), some weren't and have largely languished (GfwL, Windows Media Player, Bing). Besides, Microsoft's victories have traditionally not been through direct innovation as much as incremental product iteration which they generally do well.<p>Apple have grown at an unprecedented rate, and any company compared to them doesn't compare favourably, but that hardly means Microsoft have just sat there doing nothing.

Hence the likelihood of a bridge to nowhere or an army of trained workers in a useless field is high.<p>Certainly projects like the Hoover dam or interstate system have many positive externalities that last a long time - but it's not always easy to come up with these projects, and the labour involved is only a small percentage.<p>When you divert productive capacity of the economy to unproductive use (such as building an unnecessary bridge) then society as a whole pays because of the diversion of resources (including labour and capital).  The problem becomes more acute, because the 'shovel ready' projects are generally uneconomic ones - in many cases, if there was a positive return to be made from undertaking a certain activity, then the private sector will already have undertaken it.<p>I think the best use for the paid-unemployed is in things that are labour intensive and help with society.

It was spun off from Wendy’s in 2006 and became a publicly listed company that is now widely held by Canadian financial institutions, without one controlling shareholder (Quoting from The Star).<p>Reproducing relevant parts from an recent article from The Economist:<p>America’s corporate tax has two horrible flaws. The first is the tax rate, which at 35% is the highest among the 34 mostly rich-country members of the OECD. Yet it raises less revenue than the OECD average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to NASCAR race tracks. Last year these breaks cost $150 billion in forgone revenue, more than half of what America collected in total corporate taxes.<p>The second flaw is that America levies tax on a company’s income no matter where in the world it is earned. In contrast, every other large rich country taxes only income earned within its borders. Here, too, America’s system is absurdly ineffective at collecting money. Firms do not have to pay tax on foreign profits until they bring them back home. Not surprisingly, many do not: American multinationals have some $2 trillion sitting on their foreign units’ balance-sheets, and growing.<p>The real solution is to lower the corporate rate, eliminate tax breaks and move America from a worldwide system to a territorial one.",1409068229

As I understand it, you can also wind up paying higher processing costs generally, or even being kicked by your payment services and/or not accepted by other services in the future if your track record gets bad enough.<p>Then again, even my tiny little start-up manages to advertise an honest recurring subscription fee, tax-inclusive, with no other charges added on top later. In our entire time trading, I think we&#x27;ve had exactly one person complain that they didn&#x27;t realise it was a monthly fee when they signed up. I&#x27;m not sure how they managed to miss it -- we tell them right next to the price, in full size text, throughout the sign-up process. But even so, we just refunded their second payment and cancelled their ongoing subscription to avoid the argument, and that was the end of the matter. We never got as far as any sort of formal dispute/chargeback process via the customer&#x27;s card company.<p>So I guess I don&#x27;t have much sympathy if the kinds of big businesses mentioned in this article can&#x27;t figure it out and wind up suffering for it under these new laws.

So, foreign investment is required.<p>But, even with minimal resource taxation/royalties, Australia is becoming uncompetitive for many resource investments, with the AUD and commodity prices where they are.  Iron ore at its current price is now unprofitable, basically. As well all know, corporations require a certain ROE to do anything. Nobody is going to risk $10 billion for a possible 1% return. Massive LNG projects are getting shelved left and right.<p>There&#x27;s oil hidden all across Australia and her waters, too, but there is very little infrastructure in place such as pipelines to transport the product to terminals/refineries, like there is in the US. If Australia was to nationalize its oil industry, would its people be willing to shell out tens of billions of their own tax dollars to build this infrastructure? All speculatively, knowing that their type of oil production is not profitable at all if oil once again goes below $70 a barrel, which could happen overnight (see Sept-Nov 2008)?<p>While I could see some sectors of the resource industry being nationalized, broadly it&#x27;s just not sustainable. With costs where they are, there isn&#x27;t a ton of room for more royalties.<p>Best thing would be for policymakers to just move on from relying on mining and start focusing on educating the population and competing where it counts on the global stage.",1409067498

That is it.<p>The problem is that international mobility is crippled by bureaucratic immigration policies in addition to the classic cultural and language barriers. Thus, postulating that states should be more independent in their policies is <i>right</i>, but it needs to acknowledge that fundamentally it does not matter if it is states in a country or individual countries or something like city states or homesteading, all that is required is the ability for individuals to migrate where their ideologies and the states match.<p>And the modern world is often simultaneously the best and worst time for such mobility. In terms of real physical barriers, there are pretty much none - flight has advanced sufficiently it is not prohibitive in cost for many people in the world to realistically save up enough to fly anywhere else. Simultaneously, in the past it was much easier to just &quot;cross boarders&quot;, where the bureaucracy and monitoring of citizenship was much reduced.<p>Hopefully we progress to minimize or remove the latter, because it is the best outcome for everyone except those who want to prevent mobility to hold power over groups of people who would not stay if they had a choice.",1409067353

Not even the maintainer reviewed it.<p>I think this is a blatant counterexample actually.<p>The code _was_ reviewed. It passed the review. This just shows that security is hard and that reviews don&#x27;t always catch everything.<p>But the only reason that heartbleed ever came to light was that OpenSSL is open source. Had it not been, such a bug would have been much much more difficult to find. Yes, this is not instant, yes, it takes time and leaves people vulnerable in that time, but it did work out in the end.<p>If a similar bug were to exist in proprietary software, there&#x27;s a good chance it would never come to light at all. Save for the extremely dedicated intelligence agencies who may have the people and desire to exert the effort to find it. That&#x27;s who proprietary security software helps.<p>The Debian bug isn&#x27;t a terrible example, but it simply shows that distro-specific patches aren&#x27;t well reviewed, not projects in general. Most people who want to see OpenSSL code go to OpenSSL, not Debian.<p>Bugs happen, reviewers miss things or may not look in the right places. Open source does not mean secure by any means, it simply removes some requirements of trust of a sole entity and eases reviews.",1409066819

If it should not adequately define what happens in express contract language, then there are default rules that potentially govern what happens. <i>Those rules may or may not support your position</i>. I have bumped into cases where the default rules basically say that the contract assigns the IP rights to the customer regardless of non-payment, with the remedy for the developer simply being to sue for payment. I am not saying that such rules govern your case because it is not possible for anyone to really know your case absent a proper legal review by a knowledgeable lawyer. I am saying you may be making assumptions about your legal rights that may or may not be correct and you should not casually just assume that they are.<p>It goes without saying as well that you should be cautious about using pejorative language about the person who did this in public because of the obvious risk of setting yourself up for a defamation claim. Again, in the end you may be justified but why complicate your own claims by giving those who did whatever these people did free ammunition to fight you with.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to sound unsympathetic.

1281624,comment,1281510,1281510,0,0,fnid2,,,"This weekend one of my friends (IRL) asked me why I wasn't on Facebook.  She was shocked, as many who know me are, when I tell them I am not on facebook. They see me as a internet guru. How can an internet guru not be on facebook? What they don't know is that most Internet Gurus I know are also not on facebook.<p>The reason I am not on facebook is quite simple, I do not want to give facebook my private information, because I do not trust Facebook.  I do not trust Mark Z. I do not believe that they have individual users' best interests at heart.<p>What I do believe is that they are interested in getting more users, sharing more information, and making more money. None of these are in my best interest. In fact, as Facebook gets more users, the quality of facebook will continue to decline, as will their treatment of those users.<p>It takes a lot of money to operate 10,000 servers (or however many they have at this point). It takes a lot of ad revenue.  It takes a lot of people and investors. All of that means continued focus on the bottom line to ensure survival.<p>Facebook's only value is in the information people put into it and they will do what they need to do with that information to keep powering those tens of thousands of servers.",1271836738

1281609,comment,1280561,1280928,0,0,stse,,,"The thing is that it worked. I never seen any Wikileaks story get so much attention in the news or ""virally"" on the Internet. Here in Sweden it was a top story on all the major newspapers websites and on the evening news, but put into context. The second part with the hellfire missile, where they didn't provide much commentary, in comparison got a lot less attention. More people than usual do seem to have watched the full material and read the related reports etc. to get the full story.<p>I never really got upset about Wikileaks providing commentary, because I never had the illusion that they were going to be impartial. Don't be lazy, apply some critical thinking, listen to different sources. Leaks are in their nature untrustworthy. Even intelligence agencies with all their highly educated analysts get things wrong.<p>Finally if you stop supporting Wikileaks because you don't like that they provide commentary, editorialize, make propaganda or whatever your view are of it.

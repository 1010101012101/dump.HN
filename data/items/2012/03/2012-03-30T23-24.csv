Many people quoted fake prices and, of course, prices and availability change regularly.<p>Most of all, we'd rather not create a competitive relationship with the customer. The idea of the concept is to relieve you of all the time and stress related to flight search (especially on more complex itineraries). So asking you to first search yourself and post a price is somewhat contrary to our vision.<p>We may revert to this method in future, because we're constantly testing, but at this stage we think we have a reasonable balance between customer and expert.",1333151958

I've seen this assertion popping up a few times on HN this past week: it's conflating two similar but very different attacks in a dangerous way.<p>X-Frame-Options prevents a type of attack known as clickjacking. It is similar to a CSRF, but it involves creating an iframe to a page with a form and convincing the targeted user to submit it. It provides this protection at the browser level: if an HTTP response contains the X-Frame-Options header and the requesting page violates that directive, the response is not rendered.<p>It does <i>not</i> prevent a CSRF attack. It's impossible for it to do so: once the malicious request had made it to the server and the server has sent back a response, the attack is already complete. There's nothing the browser can do to prevent it at that point. If you use nothing but X-Frame-Options to try and prevent CSRF, you'll have a site completely vulnerable to CSRF.",1333151377

The fact that you say you don't know if you like CS is fairly alarming if you're choosing to study it and pursue a career related to it.<p>You're better off doing what you enjoy the most; you can find work related to pretty much any major if you look hard enough and you'll enjoy doing that work much more than you would anything else (especially something chosen for its earning potential or future usefulness). From a practical standpoint, if you do what gives you the most joy you'll naturally be more willing to put in the time necessary to become accomplished in your chosen field, making your chances at success and (more importantly) happiness far more likely.",1333150741

But no ""hacking"".<p>You will learn the hacking part by hanging out with the kids who like to code, grad students in the labs, by working on open source projects in your spare time, etc.  but one needs not be a CS major to participate in those.<p>If I had to start again, I would probably choose to study mathematics or philosophy. CS is a fascinating topic, but the way it is taught is antiquated, and it is one of the easiest topics to teach to oneself.<p>Of course, this is all based on my own personal experience, so it is a completely subjective opinion.",1333150673

3778642,comment,3776946,3778088,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The idea grew out of our Battlebot, one of our sponsors was Festo which makes pneumatic actuators. They had a new actuator which was a short throw 6"" diameter cylinder and offered us one for our 'bot. The idea was that if we mounted it into the front of our wedge, and then fired it when an opposing robot was on the front, it would knock them off. Doing the calculations (150 PSI, 4L expansion tank) showed that we could develop an initial thrust of 2,100lbs with a working distance of 2"". <i>That</i> calculation had the opposing 220 lb robot experiencing an acceleration of something like 1000 ft/sec^2 for .004 seconds. The end result was that we were in danger of tossing the opponent out of the 'battle box' by launching it over the top (in practice this wouldn't happen because the chance of firing the weapon under the exact center of mass was infinitesimally small) but it got us thinking about the hopper idea for the DARPA challenge (we already knew our robot could withstand the force of falling onto concrete from a height of 20').<p>Providing the gas pressure however is an issue. You can use solid CO2 recharge (drop in some dry ice, seal, and warm) but for the challenge it had to go a looooong way. And that would require a fuel, a generator, and a compressor. Weight went up, survivability went down, and some early tests on what was essentially a pogo stick pointed that it wasn't practical at those mass levels.<p>Gliding would have been an interesting choice. With something light like a parafoil wing even more so. If I dig up my notes I'll put up something on my web site about it.",1333150321

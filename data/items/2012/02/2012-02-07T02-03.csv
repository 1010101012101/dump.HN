No business owner is worried about getting bad reviews since they naturally believe their service/food/etc. is the best in the market so that isn't a factor either.<p>So, yes on a CPM basis this is a terrible deal, but on a CPM basis for a yelp user the economics might look much differently.",1328582875

I've been advertising on Yelp using their cost per click program for about a year now, and was paying about $3.50 per click up until a couple months ago.<p>I recently got a number of sales calls from reps that attempted to sell me on their new impressions program. They wanted me to pay them $600 for 1000 monthly impressions. I quickly ran the numbers and figured that even if I assumed a generous 5% click through rate, I would still be paying nearly 3.5 times more per click than I was with their PPC program. I would need to be getting a CTR of 17% just to break even, which is highly unlikely. And that's without considering the addition of an onerous 12 month contract, which I didn't have to sign under their PPC program.<p>Their impressions program does come with an added benefit though, which is the removal of competitors ads from your Yelp profile page. I'm sure this helps overall conversion rates somewhat, but there is no way it has enough impact to justify the massive increase in cost per click.<p>Ultimately though, my PPC ad impressions have gradually dropped off despite maintaining the same ad budget with Yelp. This is because they give display preference to business owners who have signed up for their impression-based program. I can only assume that means they have managed to con enough ignorant business owners into signing up.<p>I'm both vexed and pleased with this development. :)",1328581946

And actually, building a product in your free time isn't that rough; it's supporting it that will consume all of your free time.<p>Think about it, let's say you have a perfectly reasonable 40 hour work week. What would be a good extra amount to put into a side project/startup? 20 hours?<p>Now you're working 60 hours per week, just under an extra 3 hours per night. How long can you keep that up? How much time will that take away from your family?<p>Let's say you stick it through and launch. The questions and support emails roll in. How much of that will eat up your extra 20 hours per week to work on bugs and new features? And will your customers be ok with waiting the extra time while you slog away at your day job?<p>And what happens if that 40 hour/week job goes into crunch mode and goes up to 50 or maybe even more?<p>Doing this isn't necessarily hard in terms of difficulty, but it does take a LOT of time.",1328581824

When people see an ad on Yelp, they are generally looking for a place to eat right now.  They are trying to make a purchasing decision.  When they see an ad in a newspaper, it is generally incidental.  In addition, newspaper CPM is based on distribution, it's pretty likely that only a small percentage of those papers are read cover to cover, and only a small percentage of those readers look at any individual ad for more than a second.  The last time I looked at newspaper advertising, a 1/4 page for one day in a paper with a distribution of 40,000 was about $600.  If you are advertising a restaurant, I think you'd be better off giving the money to Yelp.",1328581609

Accessing these peripherals from the ARM is not recommended.</i><p>I can understand them not wanting you to access the GPU peripherals from the ARM processor, the GPU can handle out-of-order data access, but the ARM core cannot (although it sounds like you can get around it with some careful programming).<p>At this stage i'm happy we got anything out of them at all, limited as it may be. A datasheet for the GPU would be great though. But given the progress of Open Source drivers from the groups working with AMD and Nvidia (who are much more forthcoming than the embedded graphics vendors), I can't say I would prefer to wait 3 years for a functioning driver that can handle OpenGL ES 2.0 and accelerated video playback. You'll still need a binary blob in the meantime. And it's not feasible for them to just give away their driver source for free in the meantime, for the same reasons it was never feasible for nvidia or AMD to just open up their proprietary drivers.<p>I think in time the situation will improve, but you can't expect Raspberry Pi to reverse standard industry practices in a single leap and bound.

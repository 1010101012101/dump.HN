The way I did it was to start by gradually replacing the proprietary Windows applications I was using with FOSS equivalents that had good cross-platform support.<p>The next step was to install Ubuntu as a dual-boot onto my secondary computer and play around with it. I quickly determined that it was considerably <i>easier</i> to do most of the things I do on computers under Ubuntu than it was under Windows. Going back to my primary OS came to feel more and more like returning to prison after a weekend pass.<p>When it came time to replace my main PC, I bought a new box with no OS and installed Ubuntu as my primary system. Migrating my data was painless, since it was all stored in open formats by this time (moving my email was particularly nice - I just grabbed my Thunderbird profile and dragged it across to the new computer).<p>The final test was my wife, who is not that interested in technology and just wants the computer to work.

At a minimum, this means you have revenue to cover your running costs.  You can only say ""bootstrap with less than $10K"" if that 10K gives your business enough revenue to cover its running costs.  Yet this is what one of the founders has to say in another comment here on HN: <i>We will try first to build a community/traffic and then will look for revenues.</i><p>I guess it's not the founders' fault that the article was written this way.  But once they've spent a lot of time and money on actually building their community/traffic + the inevitable further development costs, and they start making some revenue, we'll know how much it cost them to bootstrap the business.<p>Some great tips for getting an MVP together though.",1277142709

1449443,comment,1448426,1448426,0,0,stoic,,,"I've got a few tidbits on the operations side of hosting that may be of interest. Since you've been around in the hosting biz a while, some or all of these things may be old hat to you. My experience is largely at mid- to large-size dedicated server hosts (1k-35k hosts), so this may not apply to your particular model, but hopefully it's useful in some way.<p>- Make sure your policies/procedures are clearly written and do not have any gaps or gray areas. Keep in mind that you will probably have to train a new hire from the ground up at some point, and the less hand-holding needed, the better. This goes for everything from operations to sales to billing.<p>- Automate EVERYTHING. Linode is a great example of how to do this correctly (although automating VPSes is a touch easier than bare-metal servers). Softlayer's web panel is pretty good, as well. The more your clients can do without opening a support ticket, the better.<p>- Monitoring is important. You should be notified of problems <i>instantly</i> so that they can be fixed very quickly, ideally before any clients notice a problem.<p>- Proprietary software/hardware for core offerings is generally a bad idea, unless you're hosting MS Exchange (and Openchange should eliminate that issue eventually). Keep in mind that you may have to migrate every bit of data someday in the future, and implement your stuff accordingly. This also ties into automation: proprietary stuff tends to be harder to write code for, harder to troubleshoot, and more expensive to maintain in the long run.<p>- Do not skimp on facilities, hardware, or network architecture. Always have hot spares to replace your live gear in case something gets fried (switches/routers, power supplies, hard drives, RAM, server chassis). This requires some investment, but telling clients ""we're waiting for a new powersupply shipment from Dell, you're down for X hours"" will make them spend X hours researching their next hosting company.<p>- If your organization is responsible for deploying hardware in datacenters, be absolutely sure that you are not overloading your power drops. If you can, get intelligent power strips that allow you to monitor load on each circuit. Know the maximum load for your hardware, in case everyone on a circuit gets slashdotted or similar.<p>- Do not roll out new services/datacenters/hardware without stress testing them first. Launching new stuff that doesn't quite work 100% (or will work with minor adjustments) will cause headaches for staff and clients alike.<p>- DO NOT LIE TO ANYONE, ABOUT ANYTHING, EVER. Transparency may be your policy, but integrity is pretty high on everyone's list, too. Admit mistakes, especially the embarrassing ones. Don't make promises you can't keep without breaking a sweat.<p>- When mistakes <i>are</i> made, take systematic steps to eliminate their causes, permanently. Examine procedural failure before human failure; the former generally leads to the latter.<p>That's just a few things I've gleaned from the last 6 years fixing broken servers... I may have left a few things out, but that should be a good start. Feel free to drop me a line sometime (email is in my profile) if you want to talk more about this kind of thing :)",1277141543

That the buyer was a financially endowed nerd already passionately motivated and inclined to what was, for that time, a solely hobbyist pursuit. Today, the price of computer hardware has plummeted, making a PC purchase within reach of nearly all. And the entry level barrier for youth to enter into the discipline of programming computing machines has never been lower.<p>* As stated, the cost of machines that 20+ years ago would preclude ownership for many kids, is now, in most all cases, a total non factor.<p>* In the good old days of BASIC PEEK and POKE, your only link to programming prowess was a geeky magazine article, or provided by a fellow nerd friend. There were a few books, but rare. No googling for help, no vast internet repostiory of tutorials and how-to guides that exist in 2006, however.<p>* The machines of yester-lore were no more than glorified calculators. In fact, the machines that sit on our desktop (and in our laps) have much more in common with old school mainframe computers than the early IBM/PC and Apple computers. Point is, running a comptuer today, in many ways requires a whole heap more of<p>* Apple Macs and Linux machines all come with all the programming tools a budding programmer could wish for. Even Windows machines, though less endowed, come packaged with C# programming environment.<p>* But all that really is needed to write programs and see the output of basic algorithms is a web browser and a text editor. Both of these come standard with any machine today.
There are still BASIC programs in textbooks? Brin is dismayed over his the internet choir's emphasis on his repeated references to BASIC, but there are at least 30+ mentions of BASIC in his article.<p>Yes, and the problem, according to Brin, isn't the textbook publishers who add program exercises in an archaic language that some computer science luminaries consider to be ""life corrupting"". it's Microsoft's fault for not maintaining lingua franca on its machines!<p>Not all of Brin's missive is misguided. I understand his sentiment, but he laments for an age that has come pass, and because of his own nostalgic remembrance, distorts reality. The computing landscape has indeed changed, but you don't have to run BASIC programs to gain an understanding of how a computer works. BASIC is no different than any of the newfangled scripting languages. Furthermore, the fundamental model of ""how a computer works"" is radically different today — the simplistic model Brin details is less instructive than the state of the computer circa 2006.<p>But while Brin bemoans the current status of programming tools for aspiring programmers, here is what is happening in the golden age of programming.<p>* Millions are busy creating home pages, scripting game macros, writing Microsoft Office VB scripts to access databases and perform Excel functions.<p>* Others are creating web applications or writing social networking applications such as MySpace.<p>* Millions are downloading and installing free and open source (F/OSS) software, including the various Linux and FreeBSD distributions. And by doing so, are receiving far greater instructive benefit by learning how a modern day computer works, encountering firsthand, the challenging experience of installing, configuring, maintaining and even scripting/programming in nearly all the layers of software and services that make up a contemporary computer system.
Even if Brin's claims have merit, the contention that its a ""problem for our nation and civilization"" is unbelievably far fetched. The discipline of computer programming differs from other fields of science — most programmers are, in large part, self taught, and gravitate to the field, based on their inkling and proficiency in being able to tell the computer what to do. Years ago, when the government went recruting programmers, they attempted over and over, to discover who would make a good programmer. Chess wizards, mathmeticians, bookkeepers, etc... were all once viewed as being optimal programmer candidates. But it was discovered that there was no common theme, and good to great programmers came from all walks of life, that a small segment of folks just had a knack for it. Even back when I went to school (I changed majors halfway through), it was expressed by professors that they viewed their job as weeding out those who won't cut it, who are pursuing the field for the money or because they think they'll dig it. And just examine the successful programmers — it's quite evident formal schooling and/or training is not necessary to ordain a great programmer. Therefore, even if all of the other points Brin contain some merit, that ""computing is not as easy"" without a ""lingua franca"", there are those that still will be drawn to the field. Incidentally, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are both college dropouts.",1277140611

1449393,comment,1448745,1448874,0,0,dkarl,,,"There isn't an easy place to find out how well various laptops are supported.  Years ago I decided to buy a laptop and did a lot of research to find one that worked well with Linux, and I found many people who claimed to have Linux working well on their laptops.  However, when I looked for detailed information and dug into write-ups people did, I found that there were always problems.  Suspend and hibernate didn't work right, usually, and various laptops had various other issues as well.  Config files had to be changed, firmware had to be patched, kernel patches from obscure places had to be applied, and surprisingly often there was a small kernel patch written by the author himself.  I would find these problems in reports of ""success"" stories, so I just assumed that everyone was struggling, and people who said they had no problems had crazy expertise and were just like the people who said the Linux desktop was totally awesome and fine in 1999.<p>As the situation of Linux on laptops has improved, however, it's been harder to find installation write-ups, which probably means that people who have no problems simply do not bother posting detailed accounts of the fact that they have no problems!  I mean, here's one, but how many people are meticulous enough to write a blog post about the fact that their laptop works, and then add the post to <a href=""http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/</a> so I can find it?<p><a href=""http://wernerroth.de/index.php/2009/12/18/kubuntu-910-runs-a-lenovo-thinkpad-sl500/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wernerroth.de/index.php/2009/12/18/kubuntu-910-runs-a...</a><p>So true success stories are mostly invisible, or at least outwardly look the same as the ""success"" stories where a guy applied six kernel patches and wrote a shell script that he runs manually whenever he needs to hibernate and claims, ""Hey, wow, my laptop works great now, and it was so easy!""<p>For a person like me, who doesn't want purchasing a laptop to turn into a major educational experience, it would be nice to have some way of knowing whether a specific laptop will work out of the box with major Linux distributions.",1277140315

19244,comment,19188,19188,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"When I was looking for a designer, I called many firms.  The end result - expect to pay 5k-10k for a small site (~10 pages).  This was outside my budget....<p>So then I tried craigslist.  I received a lot of interest, but found only one good candidate.  But this candidate found another contract before I could get back to them.  Craigslist is cool for simpler things like company logos, but didn't work for me on the web designer front.<p>So, I contacted a prof who taught a project course at a design school (university) in my area.  I asked this professor to ask his best student to contact me.  I looked over the student's portfolio and was really impressed.  This design student turned out very good work for a very reasonable price.

Nice machine, although perhaps not the most durable (I handle it fairly carefully, but it's already pretty scratched up after ~6 months). Thinking about upgrading to 3GB RAM (the max), as I run 2 WinXP VMs under Parallels (for IE 6 and 7) and that slows me down pretty bad currently.

19242,comment,19188,19188,0,0,zkinion,,,"An un-holy amount will charge out the ass.  Many have few clients, so their business model depends on charging each client alot, almost scamming them.<p>Web design is not rocket science.  With all the tools and stuff available to designers today, there is no reason the ""clothes"" of a site should ever go over a few ,000'.  <p>Don't pay 20-30k.  Leave that for big/unsophisticated companies.  <p>p.s.  A lot of designers do suck.  With developers, many can get the task done ""eventually"", but with designers, many can't get what you want... ever.  <p>",1178257018

I'm planning to get the 15"" 2.33GHz MacBook Pro,
w/ 160GB hard drive.
I don't know why they don't offer the 7200rpm hard
drives. Won't the 5400 be noticeable slow?",1178257001

19238,comment,17968,18192,0,0,vlad,,,"I heard a story about an author getting all her family and friends to buy all copies of a new book she wrote from an initial test run of all local stores.  By selling out so fast, the publisher ordered a lot of books nationwide and the book became popular partially due to the fact that it was available in every book store the second time around.  What do you think?",1178256461
19237,comment,19203,19236,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I should add, the key word was 'budget' - a 24"" iMac will probably serve you better (unless you need serious graphics card power or multiple hard drives).",1178256391
19236,comment,19203,19203,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I don't use a Mac as a primary machine (I test on them), but I do have a piece of advice - the Dell 24"" is possibly the best value monitor ever. If you're on a budget but still want some decent real estate, they're perfect. I run 2 of them, 1920x1200 on the left for general stuff and 1200x1920 on the right for code (I'm considering adding a third for notes). I find it impossible to do any serious development on a laptop these days.<p>A 23"" Cinema display is the other obvious choice - much sexier, but the specs are inferior and it costs significantly more.

There's a Halliburton case that fits it snugly on all sides; no rattling or anything.<p>People complain about the weight and size, but I never noticed a problem.  Of course, I'm a pretty big guy.",1178256231
19233,comment,19203,19203,0,0,randallsquared,,,"A PPC 17"" iMac.  My wife has a dual-G5 PowerMac.  Of course, you can't buy these models any more, but they've both been reliable.  <p>An important thing is that you should probably buy directly from Apple.  Every experience I've had buying from third parties resulted in Macs arriving with hardware problems.  Could have been a coincidence, I suppose.<p>",1178256091
19232,comment,19050,19223,0,0,busy_beaver,,,"Thanks, but I'm looking for instructions for going the other way. The Wikipedia article (at least the one I found) has good information for sending email <i>to</i> cell phones, but that information is all over the place. <p>What I need is a comprehensive, cross-carrier list for sending email <i>from</i> cell phones. I've found this information for a few carriers, but it's not complete by any means. For instance, it looks like Cingular (U.S.) and Rogers (Canada) use the same method as T-Mobile (U.S.), just using a different number (500 for T-Mobile, 121 for Cingular, and 0000000000 for Rogers).<p>I may have to devote a few days to digging out this information by hand from the carrier web sites. If I do, I'll add it to the Wikipedia article.<p>",1178255953

The 17"" was too large for me. <p>I also have a Dell 2407FPW which I highly recommend - it's  cheaper than the Apple equivalent, has a great picture and also has a built in flash memory reader.  And unlike most Dell products, the industrial design is pretty nice.",1178255186

You also definitely have to go for the 1GB ram upgrade.<p>At one point I was using a 13"" macbook,  but it was just too big.  Plus, I hated running non-intel native apps.

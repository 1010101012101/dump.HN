I went from like 200mg to 100mg without a problem and then from 100mg to 50mg with no problem then going down to 0 I got terrible headaches. I ended up doing the slow tapering like you&#x27;re supposed going to 25mg and waiting for a while then 0 but I still got negative side effects. Anyway, things slowly seemed to build up and eventually I was just as bad as before the medication so I had to go back up to 300mg over time.<p>(Just realized that different SSRIs have different treatment sizes so maybe it doesn&#x27;t compare)",1450144600

10735434,comment,10732861,10732861,0,0,rconti,,,"I just bought a 2016 Volkswagen that has laser cruise control and lane assist. I ordered the fully loaded package because the incremental cost was not large, and I figured I might as well have all the toys if I was going to the expense of buying a brand-new car.<p>I consider myself an enthusiast; I have a fair bit of time on the racetrack in lapping days and amateur races, sometimes I volunteer at car control clinics and teen instruction days. All of my cars have manual transmissions and I ride a motorcycle. I definitely did not expect to become dependent on any driving nannies.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that it&#x27;s absolutely astounding how fast you come to trust the automated systems. In my car, the laser cruise control will drive the car for you at virtually any speed. It does a great job of keeping up in traffic, has no issues with hills or going around bends, it&#x27;s always able to track the car in front of me perfectly. It uses the brakes to slow the car. I&#x27;ve got the manual transmission so it only slows the car down to about 15mph and then prompts me to take over and press the brake; if I had the automatic, it would come to a full stop in traffic and only require a tap of the accelerator to resume once traffic ahead started moving.<p>Even though I only have 700 miles on the car and have only used the laser cruise for perhaps 20 or 30 miles in total (mostly just playing with it), I find I still expect the system to brake the car once disengaged. For example, I&#x27;ll be coming up to a red light, lift off the throttle, start braking, and then think to myself &quot;huh, I wonder why the car didn&#x27;t start slowing down for me.&quot;<p>The lane assist feature will correct the steering once or twice if you start to come too close to the lane marker (within maybe 2 feet) but it&#x27;s very subtle and you barely feel it while your hands are on the wheel. After a correction or two (and maybe 10 seconds, I&#x27;m not sure exactly  how it decides), the system tells you &quot;hey, idiot, you&#x27;re supposed to be steering&quot;.  I have, on multiple occasions, been surprised that it &quot;allowed&quot; me to get as close as I was to adjacent cars, before realizing that it only is meant to keep me within my lane, it knows nothing about the vehicles around me. But something about the fact that it has lane assist (and, incidentally, ultrasonic parking sensors) fools me into thinking it knows more than it does. I&#x27;m not saying I was letting the car drive for me, I was fully in control, I was simply surprised that it didn&#x27;t override my judgement of how close is too close.<p>It&#x27;s a brave new world out there. It&#x27;s surprising how quickly you cede mental control, if not physical control, even to systems that have clearly defined limits and features that you don&#x27;t even intend on using, let alone relying on. I imagine things will get worse before they&#x27;ll get better. That said, humans are bad enough drivers that it might not get MUCH worse!",1450144089

I have zero knowledge of mountaineering other than that I used some mountaineering gear to do roofing work and the whole &#x27;sharp edge&#x27; and &#x27;rope jumped pulley&#x27; thing as well as the fact that there is no automatic shut-off should a line get caught (they hint in the article that the winches would keep running if a line gets caught) is troubling to me.

This doesn&#x27;t account for the ridiculousness that is open table and urban spoon. Often the owner has a salary position which is included in the labor cost. One place where profit can be increased is not throwing out food and portion control. The other way to increase profit is being paid cash. Nobody uses cash anymore. A 2% to 3% fee on all credit card transactions eats into that 7% profit, a lot. If Apple can make it profitable to charge 1% transaction fee or a per transaction fee like ATM transactions, they will do very well in the restaurant industry. Moreover, if their app integrated into the POS system and is used widely, they can step on opentable&#x27;s toes offering discounts and reservations.

10735292,comment,10734155,10734909,0,0,pc2g4d,,,"I went through this, too---I felt there were good reasons to get off my antidepressants, so I began tapering off of them at what I thought was a reasonable rate, something like 10% of the original dose per month (I was at 250mg so that was 25mg per month).<p>Things proceeded smoothly for a long time---getting down to 100mg I felt great. But the closer I got to zero the more sensitive I was to the dose changes, and things started to fall apart for me emotionally. I had terrible withdrawal effects, becoming severely depressed and even developing OCD-like symptoms that I had never experienced before. My anxiety was also through the roof. And so I concluded that I did, indeed, need the antidepressants, and I went back on them at nearly my original doses, and things seemed to go back to normal. (Which wasn&#x27;t great, but at least wasn&#x27;t hell either.)<p>But after learning more about other people&#x27;s successful attempts at antidepressant withdrawal I decided a few years later to try it again. I&#x27;m currently in the midst of that tapering process, taking things much more slowly. The important thing seems to be that as you approach a dose of zero your rate of tapering should also diminish. So going from 200mg down to 100mg I did it in 25mg/month increments. From 100mg to 50mg I did it in 10mg/month increments. And now going from 50mg to 25mg I&#x27;m doing it in 5mg/month increments. I&#x27;m right at the point where things fell apart last time, but so far things are going great.<p>The dose->blood serum concentration response curves for this medication are non-linear, suggesting that something other than constant incremental tapering is needed in order to keep the rate of change to brain chemistry constant. The rate of taper must be decreased as the dose comes down.<p>Of course, in theory you&#x27;d have to live infinitely long in order for such an approach to get you to zero. So at some low dose like 12.5mg or 6.25mg I&#x27;ll just have to cold-turkey it and drop down to zero.<p>I think people underestimate the degree to which their brain chemistry has adapted to the presence of the drugs. When they fail to do well emotionally when off the drugs, they blame it on their native brain chemistry being broken---it&#x27;s seen as proof that the original &quot;illness&quot; was real and the drugs were needed. But my belief now is that this is an artifact of the brain being given insufficient time to adapt to the absence of the drugs. Slow, slow tapering is the way to go.<p>Regarding antidepressants saving lives, I also believed that mine saved mine in my darkest hours. And perhaps they did, but I now consider that to be only due to the placebo effect. The physical symptoms such as dry mouth made it feel like the drugs were really doing something. But ultimately I think their power was only that which I gave them by believing they were a miracle cure.",1450141795

Basically that Google paid the exact amount stipulated in UK law and it that was too low it was up to the governments to change the law. I kind of agree - the situation is not good and should be fixed by the governments not the CEOs. After all the CEOs main duty is to serve the shareholder which they are doing in this case. The governments main duty should be to serve the people which they are being slack at.<p>I&#x27;ve got my own idea how to fix the situation. Could almost be done as a start up - feel free to use the idea - we need some sort of (ideally official) global accounting body that estimates how much profit each large international company makes globally and what percentage of their sales are in each country. So for Facebook that might be $4bn global profits, 42% US, 5% UK, SomeRandomTaxHaven 0.01% etc. Then all the politicians in any country have to do is say companies have to pay tax on the larger of either their local tax return or the international pro rata figure, so in this example the UK would tell Facebook to pay corporate tax on 4000*.05 = $200m or they&#x27;ll ban them.",1450141320

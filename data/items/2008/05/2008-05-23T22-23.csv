I like a skinny column of code next to something else -- either another skinny column of code (maximized gvim, one vertical split) or Firefox with some documentation/reference in it. Firefox and most IDEs seem to want the whole screen, especially on a 1280-px-wide or smaller display.<p>I can strip the stylesheets off of gratuitously spread-out web pages with Greasemonkey, but most IDEs seem to require enough screen real estate for, um, stuff, that a window with 80 columns of text still takes up more than half the screen.",1211583545

198479,comment,197182,198473,0,0,vlad,,,"I calculate $1678 after taxes, a savings of $421.  I thought the same thing as you and bought a MacBook for $999 but returned it because it was slower, dimmer, smaller, and more mirror-like than my glossy MacBook Pro while weighing the same and looking like a children's toy.<p>What ultimately caused me to return it was trying to run a 3D plugin of a scene in a drawing program.  It was unbelievably slow, while I remembered how well a Dell m1330 ran, which has the same integrated video chipset, Intel's X3100.  I researched that either Apple or Intel had crappy video drivers on the Mac for that chipset, which meant it was already behind the times out of the box, never mind in two years.<p>And with the discount, the MacBook Pro might even be sold for a profit after 3-6 months in the worst case scenario (since including taxes it's worth $2,100), but the same MacBook at either Student Developer or Student price would likely be sold for a loss.",1211583273

It's quite powerful and robust providing many commonly used modules that are found in most sites (user, CMS, media etc.)<p>It's open source and the developers are quite helpful on the mailing list. Documentation is fairly decent with many howto guides for newcomers. Being a web-developer for over 7 years I highly recommend it.",1211582809
198474,comment,198382,198424,0,0,xirium,,,"Locked telephones have set a bad precedent and some broadband ISPs are attempting to do the same thing with routers. In the UK, Sky, part of NewsCorp, supplies a badged NetGear DG834G or suchlike with patched firmware. However, it isn't obvious how to change the settings - or change the account details to make it work with other ADSL ISPs. It doesn't have default NetGear username/password of admin/password and uses admin/sky instead. Thankfully, the GPL2 source is available. However, I'm very concerned that in the future ISPs could offer enhanced or exclusive access through routers which are not trivial lock down or patch and which would be incompatible with other ISPs.",1211582745

E.g., the ability to record the camera at the same time as the screen, so you can have a picture-in-picture for the narrator at any point. Or, the ability to zoom and pan over the whole-screen recording at any point. It even knows at any given point where the frontmost window is, so you can select it after the fact during video editing.<p>All in all, a pretty impressive new approach to screencast editing.",1211581866

Where a traditional database query would issue one request and get back a thousand rows of eight columns in a pipelined stream, a (dumb, but entirely plausible) RPC architecture might end up iterating over a thousand <i>remote</i> objects, calling an accessor method for each field, and making thousands of synchronous round trips to the server to accomplish what the SQL query did in just one.",1211580053

It could just be a coincidence, but it feels like the chars should be shifted around so that the whole thing makes a zodiac sign. All the funky chars being the sign & the text being in the white background.<p>Lots of the characters are also upside down, mirrored or both. Superimposing a zodiac sign on it would give us 4 quadrants that could be used to flip the characters back to their correct orientation.<p>As for the deliberate misspelling...maybe. I don't buy it though. All the wrong words are misspelled. e.g. <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Zodiac_cipher.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Zodiac_ci...</a> He misspells paradise, but repeatedly uses the letters ""kill"".

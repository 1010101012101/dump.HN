10606430,comment,10598065,10606326,0,0,pbsd,,,"The shuffle question ties in with the overlap question. Let&#x27;s stick with the AES in counter mode example. AES is a block cipher, or in other words a keyed permutation. What this means is that each key (resp. seed) determines a distinct permutation that we use to generate the blocks AES_K(0), AES_K(1), etc. In effect, each seed will result in an entirely distinct and independent 2^128-block sequence, instead of simply the same sequence starting at a different place, which is usually the case for non-cryptographic generators. So 2^128 possible keys (or 2^256, if you go AES-256) times 2^128 output blocks per key is probably enough to cover all possible card shuffles.<p>I do believe that. RC4 is a good example, actually; the unexpected properties that make RC4 be considered completely broken for cryptography are considered irrelevant for simulations (I won&#x27;t swear by this, but I&#x27;ll bet that RC4 passes all of TestU01&#x27;s tests). The standards are just so much higher for cryptographic primitives. I&#x27;m sure unsexy generators can be suitable to this or that application. But due to the ad hoc nature of the statistical tests used, you can&#x27;t be sure that your generator is not oddly correlated with a concrete application. I&#x27;ve written a comment a few days ago---on a thread very similar to this one---about a real-world case of this happening [1].<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10549024"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10549024</a>",1448102815

Some people may truly misunderstand encryption, it is extremely unlikely that Clinton, McCain, the the directors of several TLAs actually believe they can re-bottle the encryption genie.<p>Stopping encryption is obviously not the goal.<p>They may want to put a leash on the power that Silicon Valley has been gaining over the last few decades. Asking for something impossible is a good way to set someone up to fail, especially when the you can tie it to various recent tragedies with the usual emotion-driven rhetoric.<p>Maybe the goal is just to scare people away from encryption by associating it with terrorists or the fear of arrest for aiding-and-abetting[1].<p>What about banking and other business uses of encryption? Nobody ever said the government was internally consistent; selective enforcement is a powerful tool. I&#x27;m sure those uses will continue to be ignored.<p>[1] the disgusting comments about hanging Snowden ( <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/260817-ex-cia-director-snowden-should-be-hanged-for-paris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/260817-ex-cia-di...</a> ) could be interpreted as a veiled threat to anyone that uses encryption",1448100843

It&#x27;s a detailed history of Copernicus, Brahe and in particular Kepler, but is also about how new models of knowledge gain traction. So it goes way beyond simplistic &#x27;lone genius&#x27; analyses but still celebrates the great achievements of individuals. A wonderful read.",1448100796

Do you actually think these two astronomers and other scientists just came up with their results? That&#x27;s not how science works.<p>Unfortunately many Western historians casually ignore or at best minimize the impact the Islamic scientific movement had on many fields such as philosophy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Instead they jump from the Greeks to the pre-Renaissance era. &quot;If Europe was in a state of academic decline, so was everyone else&quot;.

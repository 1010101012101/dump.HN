Evasiveness (""one of the leading X""), attempting to impress me with things I don't care about or am likely to consider negative (""a Fortune 500 company,"" ""one of the largest Visual Basic code bases in the industry""), signs of buzzword bingo or technical incompetence (""must have significant experience in PERL, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, ASP, C#, ColdFusion"", ""must have 10+ years of experience with Windows XP""), signs that the accounting department and glossy magazines are choosing technologies (any mention of ColdFusion or Dreamweaver).<p>Yeah, the latter list is much longer.  It's a lot easier to do things wrong than to do them right. <p>

11264,comment,11264,9770,0,0,cs,,,"From Eastern Europe ::: for us, the real life hackers with only 1% of your GDP, it is obvious to _USE_ a software or any IP product, service rather than paying for it. We have money only for cheap hardware (forget macbook), broadband, and maybe some for hosting. These trends represent the future: 4/5 of world population the chinese, indian, arabs, or latinos won't have more money to spend going online.<p>From this entire business scene only Google is able to get money from us. We are willing to pay only for Google Ads because they are cheap, straight, and delivers ROI next minute.<p>We go connected for nothing, we create for nothing and we get revenue by partnering Google.<p>Any other company who does not follow this business model is, or will be dead.
Nobody ever will pay for any tools to create an online business but we will share our revenue with who generates us profit.<p><p>

If any buyer, even Microsoft, offered the sort of environment I wanted to work in, plus enough money that I could walk away and not need to work another corporate IT job again if the environment changed, I'd sell.<p>And some of this is predicated on the experience of a good friend of mine, whose team mostly bootstrapped a very profitable company, then sold it to their largest corporate customer; suddenly they were getting guaranteed salaries, and they got to watch their project earn tens of millions in revenue, but the working environment was politically toxic and the company (now a wholly-owned subsidiary) was the football in constant turf wars, and (in retrospect, especially after seeing the first two years' income from the project) the price they asked was about 1/10 of what it should have been.<p>I can't alter the turf wars and political toxicity in certain corporations, but I can make sure I ask a price for my company that means I can stand up and walk away with no financial worries if they develop.

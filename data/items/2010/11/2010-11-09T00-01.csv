1884799,comment,1884052,1884466,0,0,redthrowaway,,,"I actually think software engineering has quite a bit in common with construction.  We both work off blueprints, we have certain regulations that our creations have to adhere to, and we acquire skills as we gain experience that allow us to shortcut the conceptual underpinnings of the work of creation.  A framer, for example, should have a rudimentary understanding of physics.  They should know why certain shapes are strong, and how much load a given frame can bear.  As they gain experience, however, they begin to recognize shortcuts.  A joist in one circumstance should be 6x8"", 10x14"" in another.  The knowledge of which implementation needs each size is not, however, rigorously determined or proven.  The framer knows from experience which is required.<p>The same is true of software engineers.  We gain, through experience, the knowledge as to what solutions are suitable for a particular problem.  In general, however, we don't arrive at this knowledge through rigorous proofs.  We arrive at it by empirical testing, and figuring out which solutions work best in a given scenario.  Just as the framer is generally unconcerned with the principles of architectural engineering for the business of building a house, so too is the software engineer <i>generally</i> unconcerned with the theoretical underpinnings of their code when it comes to building a product.  Certainly, if one is designing a new non-relational database language, or a new search algorithm, then you'd better have a very good grounding in theory.  When it comes time to implement them, however, we generally accept that they are theoretically correct and concern ourselves with making it work in the real world.  In the same way, a framer will generally accept that the architect knew what they were doing, and not concern themselves with the theoretical correctness of what they're building.",1289264110

1884791,comment,1884326,1884698,0,0,PixelRobot,,,"Well, you're more likely to know the sociable people with Asperger's than the antisocial ones, right? What you describe is not the case with all the people who have Asperger's. Some avoid social interaction because they know they don't understand the norms and prefer to avoid potential conflicts. You can't make a generalization there.<p>Shyness is all about anxiety about social interaction. Oversensitivity to social norms can cause it, yes, but also bad experiences or low self-esteem.<p>Introversion/Extroversion is about where you focus your mind. Introverted people are more focused on their own thoughts and mental processes, and extroverted people are more focused on interacting with the mental processes of other people. If something, introversion would imply caring less about social interaction and social norms, not oversensitivity. That doesn't mean introverted people don't care or follow social norms, or that they're not sociable. They just need more time with their own thoughts and feel less stimulated by petty social interaction like small talk. That doesn't mean introverted people are not sociable. Some introverts are very sociable and good at conversations, because they try to make their conversations interesting and stimulating. Some other are not interested in being sociable at all.",1289263920

I have realized that most people automatically think that just because something is in Cydia, it /definitely/ means that it was rejected from the App Store; like that's the only possible explanation. But it's not. I think that you have a great point that Apple should change the App Store and allow extensions, and tweaks, and everything else. Or, even better, make a /different/ app, like an Extensions app, where you could download Extensions. If it wasn't for extensions, Apple would probably not have advanced very far since 2007. Many of their ideas come from the jailbreak community; multitasking, homescreen wallpaper, 3rd party software itself! I'm sure they realize this, they just think that they have made a system and people should not be changing it. I think it would be a /major/ benefit to their company to allow extensions.

1884769,comment,1883608,1884262,0,0,spike021,,,"Unfortunately, there are several reasons why Apple would think to prohibit its users from installing system-level ""hacks"" (as they would call them) or plugin extensions.  The most ""important"" or foremost of which being that which will allow piracy.  I am not endorsing Apple's closed system model, but simply stating one of its reasons.  Deny it or not, such plugins can and will exist and as long as such are active, this will be a problem.  I know, piracy is a completely different subject, but it's a reasonable issue affecting Apple's decision IMHO.  I do have to say that the PRIMARY reason why I jailbroke was in order to add nonexistent functionality through add-ons.  Heck, it's the same reason why I ""hacked"" my PSP so many years ago.  I like having freedom to change certain settings, the kind of which that won't affect anybody else but me, and I am definitely taking the risk.  As long as Apple uses an App Store model, it's as you say saurik.  There will still be restrictions because Apple will be the middleman.

1884760,comment,1884062,1884062,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Buckminster Fuller predicted a future in which physical structures are increasingly replaced by <i>information</i> (with the implication that the information accomplishes the same task as the physical structure, but better).<p>I work as a government contractor doing engineering for the FAA.  Most of my senior peers, and our bosses are of the baby boomer generation.  (Strangely, the middle generation is entirely unrepresented here and we have only baby boomers or a few milennials, no one in between.)  They have a good handle on how digital logic gates and analog circuits work, but they don't quite seem to know the right way to think about software.  (Example, true story:  My boss came in the other day and asked how much variation there is in flashing rate of some lights we're controlling.  The programmer of the control unit was perplexed and said, ""The flashing is done entirely by software, so... there's no variation.""  My boss said, ""OK but what I mean is, how does the flashing rate vary <i>with temperature</i>?""  That's what I mean by them not really having a handle on how software differs from circuits.)<p>So, combine these two things:  physical things being replaced with information, and a generation of managers who don't really ""get"" software.  Now, you take these things that would have been aspects of the schedule as separate hardware pieces to be developed or other physical things, and chuck more and more of them over the fence into this nebulous category of ""the software"" and (in the minds of the schedule-making people) it's kind of like a black hole:  stuff disappears into and the radius doesn't increase, but it's also a massive heavy thing that's hard to think about.<p>So my argument is that not all of the difficulty with estimating the cost of software is the ""fault"" of the programmers or the nature of software.  You have to look at the fact that software is <i>doing more</i> but nonprogrammers don't know how to think about software and so throw it all into this sort of schedule black hole.",1289263166

It will seem almost shocking to many here on HN, but the traffic control industry is lagging behind drastically.<p>I believe the newer systems started going IP based just a few years ago, and (gasp) wireless networking of traffic lights is a <i></i>really<i></i> new thing. It has to do with the environment the system must handle and how ""tamper-proof"" it must be, which leads to hardware and software being waaayy behind the curve.<p>The main point though, is that it would be very reasonable to think that some hardware, especially if installed before the 90s, wouldn't have ""software"" to just ""turn off monitoring"". Even the newer boxes aren't completely controlled by software, they have physical circuitry that operates as a ""fall-back"" to make sure that things like two green lights on adjacent roads can't be green at the same time, even if the software was hacked, had a bug, etc.",1289262572

I had really bad vision with astigmatism, don't remember the exact numbers, but they told me my right eye would never be 20/20. I went with the Lasik / WaveFront / Intralase, figured these are my eyes I might as well not take any chances (I'm in California, imagine an earthquake during the procedure). Cost me about $4500. From research to procedure it took me about a year to finally decide to do it.<p>Took about 15 minutes for the whole procedure and my results were awesome. A few minor side effects: After the surgery on the way home my eyes began to burn a bit, like when you get hot sauce in your eye, but not unbearable. Only lasted for about 30 minutes then went away. Also for the first few months my eyes would take a little while to adjust to night time. At first I would see larger halos in the street lights. After a few minutes in the dark halos would get smaller. After 4 to 6 months I didn't have any issues adjusting to night time.<p>I'm very happy I had it done, it's really worth it.

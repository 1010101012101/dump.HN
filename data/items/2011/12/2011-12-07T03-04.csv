As would most guys.<p>Almost every guy in IT I've ever worked with gets emotional, angry, sarcastic, abrasive, abusive or annoyed when stupid and inconsiderate people (ie users, coworkers, bosses, jerks in general) waste their time or make them deal with unnecessary stupidity). I've never heard anyone suggest that those guys were menstral, or unsuited to working in IT because of it. Guys working on call after often short tempered, upset, frustrated and generally emotional from the lack of sleep after a lot of call outs - but when a girl goes through the same thing, guys in IT are often and consistently dicks about it, and act like they don't behave the exact same way.<p>Girls cop a huge amount of gender biased abuse in enterprise IT (in my experience and observation) and generally take it with at least as much grace as any guy takes user stupidity - and then has to put up with user stupidity as well.<p>I'd never have survived in IT with the shit the girls I know have had to put up with. I'd have found another career very early. When a woman with legit tech chops and a decent length career behind her in IT isn't a man hating bitch - I generally think she should get a lot of leeway for having a bit of a temper - not the kind of lynch mob response that showed up in a lot of the conversations about Rachel.",1323230393

My PayPal account was frozen for almost 2 months, back in 2002. I had about $1,200 in the account, and I could not get at any of it. It was a painful episode for me, as I was broke and had been planning to use some of the money to pay my rent. PayPal asked for a lot of documentation from me. They wanted me to prove my address, but as I rented and moved around a lot, it was difficult to do so. I had to get a friend to put me on the electricity bill over at their house (the friend's house) so I could get some paper documentation that PayPal would accept.

It could turn out to be not important at all except for isolated cases like this.  It could turn out to be important, but easy to simulate on a classical computer, and so amenable to study using today's tools.  It could turn out to be very important and ubiquitous, so much so that large scale simulation is intractable.  If that turns out to be true, then there is a strong case to be made for building quantum computers to attack this problem.  I think most scientists think the first or second option is most likely, but if the last opportunity occurs this will represent a major shift.",1323229912

3322331,comment,3321054,3321672,0,0,Jach,,,"The sentence you quoted is poorly phrased, but taken with its following sentence as a whole the meaning is still there.<p>""A school that has only profitability as it's goal will be outed as such in a free market, and will not be chosen by consumers that care more about their children's experience. Schools that provide the best long-term experience for the students will have the best profits, no shady practices required.""<p>The reason why the first sentence is poorly phrased is because the second sentence says in effect ""if a school <i>really</i> has profitability as a goal, it will naturally avoid shady practices because otherwise it will be destroyed."" It's a classic example of short-term vs. long-term decision-making, and in this case suggesting that long-term profitability requires that no shady practices are used for long and will beat out short-term profitability employing shady practices.<p>It's not a towering argument in favor of free market education, but I'm not sure that University of Phoenix is a counterexample. Do you have more information on this? My understanding was that their main evilness is taking advantage of the public non-free-market federal student loans business to get more students and money instead of lowering their prices, which is what some say would happen if you took the government out of the equation for public and private loan backing.<p>My own view is that education costs are tightly tied to the school brand first (which includes the most general brand of being able to say you're college-educated anywhere, which is very important for many jobs and shouldn't be (the knowledge yes, not the ""spent time at this location with these people"" part)), administrators next, then professors, and the actual knowledge somewhere further down near the bottom.

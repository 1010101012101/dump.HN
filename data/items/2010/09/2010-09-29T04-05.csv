However, the point of this diet isn't so you can pig out on candy bars and still stay in shape. You can easily eat over maintenance in one meal and end up gaining weight on the warrior diet.<p>The basic premise is to under eat for about 20 hours followed by 4 hours of over eating. You still need to watch what you eat during that 4 hour period, should be high protein, whole grains and veggies. You will go through about 2 weeks of hunger pains at first, but afterwards its great and should experience big gains in energy and focus.",1285733495

You&#x27;re getting interviews so you&#x27;re doing something right and looking in the right place. Obviously you can find jobs to interview for and sounds like your CV is fine.<p>So keep at it?<p>You just haven&#x27;t clicked with someone yet. Perhaps the questions you need to be asking is, &#x27;how do I blow people away at interview?&#x27;.<p>But to answer your question, if you didn&#x27;t know there&#x27;s a monthly &#x27;Ask HN: who&#x27;s hiring&#x27; thread:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9812245"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9812245</a><p>That&#x27;s a list of a thousand companies that hire software developers. Plus loads more on the older threads, there&#x27;s one every month.<p>If you&#x27;re having trouble finding more jobs to apply for, you could email all the ones near you with a brief covering letter (as the body of the email) and your CV and ask whether they have any entry level positions. Bonus points for including something in the covering letter that shows you&#x27;ve read a bit of what they do. If you&#x27;re having trouble figuring out who to email, you can phone the company and ask the secretary &#x27;that you&#x27;re looking for an entry level position and you were wondering who you would send your CV to&#x27;. They get questions like this all the time. Depending on who you are, that might be scary, but the quicker you get used to doing scary things, the more successful in life you will be.<p>The worst they can say is no.<p>In all seriousness, so many companies are constantly looking for developers but not constantly advertising. Like I went to a meetup last Thursday and a no-experience guy there got an interview from another one of the attendees, even though that&#x27;s not what he came for.<p>Also, to follow up on that, network, go to technical meetups, talk to <i>everyone</i> and introduce yourself. Drop in that you&#x27;re looking for your first job without sounding too needy, making it the focus of the conversation or doing the whole &#x27;I haven&#x27;t got a degree&#x27; thing. Also some meetups have job announcements at the end, you can ask to be included in them, if you do ask keep it positive and short.<p>Finally, though it sounds like your CV is fine, get a couple of articulate people to look over your CV, especially anyone you or your parents know who works in marketing (for the presentation), recruitment (because they know what works) or IT (for the relevant experience).",1441537109

He thinks that his &quot;way of thinking&quot; is superior to everyone else. He is convinced that he discovered <i>the truth</i> about reality. It&#x27;s all kind of bullshit he talks about, which I&#x27;d sum up as &quot;cognitive biases&quot; he fails to see (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), while blaming everyone else to be incapable of understand his world view.<p>Tthe older he gets, the less flexible he becomes in his thinking, and the more arrogant he becomes. He has a deeply flawed understanding of what science is and how it works and – like many esoterics – he&#x27;d abuse some scientific concepts to explain his world view, but reject other concepts if they don&#x27;t fit the world view. E. g. Quantum Theory as a wishy-washy explanation for &quot;supernatural phenomenons&quot;, if you know what I mean.<p>I know, it&#x27;s impossible to change someone, if he isn&#x27;t willing to do change himself.

It turns out to be irrelevant with ZeroMQ.<p>First, message rates with ZeroMQ are often hundreds of thousands per second. The architecture must be designed so that no buffers, anywhere, overflow. If they do, you have a problem, usually a slow subscriber. Throwing out older data doesn&#x27;t cure the problem. What ZeroMQ does is punish the slow subscriber by dropping so that the publisher doesn&#x27;t crash. It&#x27;s not recovery for the subscriber, it&#x27;s protection for the publisher (and thus for other subscribers).<p>Second, trying to delete old messages is complex and sometimes impossible (if they&#x27;re already in system buffers). The design of ZeroMQ&#x27;s internal pipes has one writer and one reader, without locks. For the writer to mess with the reader would slow down everything and introduce risk of bugs. Dropping new incoming data is the only way anyone has ever found to keep things running at full speed.<p>These design choices were often delicate and counter-intuitive, yet they have turned out to be mostly accurate.",1441535811

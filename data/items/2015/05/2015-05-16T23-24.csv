9558086,comment,9557503,9558048,0,0,tel,,,"To clarify coolsunglasses&#x27;s note that it is actually possible to hide side effects behind a pure interface (when they can be proven pure) here&#x27;s the &quot;counter&quot; example in the paper<p><pre><code>    import Control.Monad.ST 
    import Data.STRef

    data Counter s = Counter { get :: ST s a, inc :: ST s () }

    mkCounter :: STRef s Int -> Counter s
    mkCounter v = Counter (readSTRef v) (incRef v) where
      incRef ref = do
        i <- readSTRef v
        writeSTRef v (i + 1)
</code></pre>
A little noisier since we note that reading the ref is an impure action and we track a phantom `s` parameter around in order to convince Haskell that certain uses of counters are pure. Now<p><pre><code>    comp :: ST s Int
    comp = do
      v <- newSTRef 0
      let c = mkCounter v

      inc c
      inc c
      inc c
      get c
</code></pre>
This is technically a pure computation despite using an impure mechanism internally. We can get Haskell to prove this for us<p><pre><code>    pureComp :: Int
    pureComp = runST comp
</code></pre>
Here `runST :: (forall s . ST s a) -> a` completes the proof that if the `s` variables in a computation are completely undetermined then that computation must be pure.",1431820691

Because I can&#x27;t think of a way around this in a language with destructors, short of some sort of &quot;doesn&#x27;t throw&quot; effect (which Rust doesn&#x27;t currently have) or aborting on every exception.  Do you have any pointers?  Similarly, I don&#x27;t understand how your &quot;antitry&quot; solution would be efficient on pathological input--&quot;zero-cost&quot; exceptions are far from that when the exceptions actually happen (and can be made to happen by malicious users).  You also haven&#x27;t addressed how I&#x27;m supposed to know to use antitry in the first place, which is one of my biggest issues with unchecked exceptions--again, the only alternative I see is a &quot;throws&quot; effect.  All of these are language level concerns, not implementation-level ones.<p>> Exceptions are the flexible primitive, not Result<p>Catchable exceptions require coding transactionally if you want to use them everywhere and maintain strong exception safey.  There&#x27;s an enormous cost associated with that too; and worse, it can&#x27;t be checked by the compiler.<p>Again: I have actually benchmarked a lot of code that uses Result, explicitly checking to see if it was a performance issue.  It&#x27;s almost never a performance issue.  So performance-related arguments for why exceptions should be used everywhere are going to fall on deaf ears here.

They aren&#x27;t even connected directly by major streets. The bin Laden compound was a couple of side streets off the main road in that part of the city.<p>Unless Pakistan keeps track of who is living in private residences to a much greater extent than we do in the US, there is no reason to expect that they knew he was there solely based on the location.",1431817548

    Prelude> getLine >>= putStrLn
    blah
    blah

    Prelude> do a <- [1, 2]; b <- [4, 5]; if (even a) then (return b) else (return a)
    [1,1,4,5]

    Prelude> do a <- Just 1; b <- Just 1; if (even a) then (return b) else (return a)
    Just 1

    Prelude> do a <- Just 4; b <- Just 2; if (even a) then (return b) else (return a)
    Just 2

    Prelude> do a <- Nothing; b <- Just 2; if (even a) then (return b) else (return a)
    Nothing
    -- depending on a computation that may not have succeeded
</code></pre>
Then you could distinguish pure and impure code just from the types by assigning a type wherever effects need to be performed to get our effecty value.<p><pre><code>    Prelude> :t getLine
    getLine :: IO String

    Prelude> :t putStrLn
    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()

    Prelude> :t (>>=)
    (>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

    Prelude> :t (>>=) getLine
    (>>=) getLine :: (String -> IO b) -> IO b

    Prelude> :t (>>=) getLine putStrLn
    (>>=) getLine putStrLn :: IO ()
</code></pre>
Then we could make a syntax to wrap it all up and let you write code as if it was actually sequential, imperative instructions.<p><pre><code>    main = do
      putStrLn &quot;Enter your name please: &quot;
      name <- getLine
      putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name)
</code></pre>
Maybe we could make a programming language around this, maybe name it after a mathematician that contributed to the development of lambda calculus.",1431817463

8156471,comment,8154730,8156245,4,0,djokkataja,,,"You seem to think that the &quot;economy&quot; in its (mostly or completely) unregulated form is some kind of ideal. Why? Such an economy is dependent on rational actors and perfect information, neither of which are present in human society.<p>It seems more reasonable that each human in a group will try to maximize their own economic outcomes as well as to assist the other humans that they personally care about in maximizing their economic outcomes. In the modern world, it&#x27;s often expected that humans are able to extrapolate that the people that they don&#x27;t know are similarly worthwhile human beings. So while it&#x27;s generally considered acceptable to try to maximize things for themselves, doing so while knowingly making other humans worse off is seen as morally detestable.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that humans generally care much less about abstract ideals than they do about themselves, the people they care about, and their social standing. The &quot;economy&quot; as it exists in reality does in fact exist for the benefit of one class of persons: those persons who are willing to tolerate it and have the power to change it. When this real-life economy is no longer tolerated, it is changed, in ways like antitrust legislation, class action lawsuits against companies that participate in wage collusion schemes, and the French Revolution.",1407570764

8156451,comment,8155816,8155816,2,0,ggchappell,,,"Okay, this is a bit of a side issue, but a few details about the NumPy Quicksort are bothering me.<p>First, we&#x27;ve known since 1997 how to improve Quicksort&#x27;s worst case number of comparisons to O(n log n) for an n-item list. (Track the recursion depth and switch to Heap Sort on the current sublist if the depth exceeds 2 log_2(n); this is usually called &quot;Introsort&quot;.) This optimization is pretty well known. For a front-line library like NumPy to include a quadratic-worst-case sorting algorithm in 2014 is ridiculous.<p>Second (and rather less important), we can&#x27;t write Quicksort with constant extra space usage, since, when sorting a small sublist, we need to remember the pivots in the larger sublists we are in the middle of sorting. So Quicksort&#x27;s extra space usage is going to be at best O(log n) subscripts/pointers for an n-item list. However, the docs say 0 work space required. This would be correct if the sort were written in &quot;C&quot; and NumPy only counts Python objects in its space usage, but I can&#x27;t find anywhere this is stated.<p>Third (and perhaps <i>very</i> important), I don&#x27;t see anything in the docs about locality of reference or any other is-this-algorithm-friendly-to-modern-processor-architectures issues. There are good reasons Quicksort is largely being abandoned for standard-library sort implementations.",1407569848

Some have suggested that we &quot;just talk.&quot; We tried that.

Since then Amazon has made three separate offers to Hachette to take authors out of the middle. &quot;<p>And the solutions they then present are very admirable. However, it was still amazon that took the unilateral action to punish authors, and it was likely the backlash from that that motivated those three noble solutions. It&#x27;s a shame amazon had to poison the well with that move, because everything else points to Hachette being dumb and making bad decsions that hurt authors.<p>&quot;Hachette spent three months stonewalling and only grudgingly began to even acknowledge our concerns when we took action to reduce sales of their titles in our store.&quot;<p>Hachette stonewalled.

The pie is simply bigger.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not a justification to hurt authors.

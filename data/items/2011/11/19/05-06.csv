3254718,comment,3251407,3252791,1,0,lancewiggs,,,"Here are 3 reasons for gTLDs that come to mind. (I'm late to the scene, and there are plenty of pioneers around who can provide a better answer):<p>1: Without some sort of naming convention websites would be a string of numbers. This was what the one we ended up with, and we are all used to it now.<p>2: The TLDs provide the first port of call for looking up a url. Thus the .com DNS server needs to know al the .coms, but that is it. the 2LD servers likewise have to deal in their area only. That's a lot easier than storing and refreshing the entire authorized internet DNS lookup at all points. (I'm getting out of my depth here, but there is some pretty clever stuff going on these days)<p>3: As you say the TLDs provide basic 'segregation' and while .net and .com use cases seem to have merged, .gov, .mil and beyond that country ccTLDs such as .uk, .nz and .au are all performing important roles for now and for a long time going forward.<p>Meanwhile there are 7 billion people, and goodness knows how many businesses in the world, and many of them have similar names. Different TLDs and 2LDs give them a chance to coexist. \nYahoo and other giant corporations are a bit different as they are truly global and need to buy up all domains, but most companies are not interested in every last TLD.<p>The money made from the gTLD and 2LDs goes towards supporting the DNS system, which is what makes the internet work, SOPA notwithstanding.",1321682166

3254716,comment,3254367,3254432,2,0,cookiecaper,,,"The networks already want to cut Netflix out. That is what caused the whole fiasco this summer. Netflix can't just behave and hope that the networks keep throwing them bones -- that's just not how business works. It's important that they take aggressive moves to counteract this. If copyright law were a bit more reasonable, maybe this wouldn't be necessary.<p>And I think the thread they're picking up with AD is perfect -- just imagine all of those long-lost fan favorites like Firefly, AD, and now Community getting picked up and streamed on Netflix in a climate where the show's creators are at least theoretically given freedom from network meddling (not to mention the much more realistic ""ratings"" that would be possible like this). I may even pay for that, and I almost never watch TV and generally hate it, but if Netflix cultivated all of the great content that the mainstream networks regularly threw away, they'd definitely have a much brighter outlook.<p>The problem I see potentially arising out of this is the conflict of interest for cable companies as online streaming continues to override cable TV viewership. With Netflix picking up shows that had initially been considered by premium cable networks like HBO or Showtime, how much interest will Comcast have in keeping pricing for internet access out of the ridiculous ranges and varied pacakges of cable television?",1321682104

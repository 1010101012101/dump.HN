They bought houses who's value was 40-50% inflated and then had that value disappear, almost overnight.<p>If they can't pay for their houses, they can't afford said houses, no matter what said houses are worth or how said worth changes.<p>Mortgages aren't ""called"" when a house's value changes.  Mortgages aren't ""called"" when the lender goes bankrupt (someone else buys the mortgage).  The terms don't change when the house value changes.<p>They're losing their houses because they can't afford to pay for them.",1223917001
331209,comment,330987,330987,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"To those people wondering about the influence of politics on Krugman's prize:<p>(1) Krugman won the John Bates Clark Medal for economics in 1991.  This is a Prize given every two years to an American Economist under 40.  It's often considered harder to win than the economics Nobel, and is a significant predictor of who actually will win the Nobel.  Note that this was largely before Krugman got involved in politics, and past winners include Milton Friedman.  I doubt his politics helped him win this one.<p>(2) By most measures of citation impact, Krugman is one of the world's leading economists.  E.g., <a href=""http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.nbcites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.nbcites.html</a><p>Citations are, of course, an imperfect predictor of the significance of someone's work, this is just an additional data point.<p>I doubt his involvement in US politics had much impact on the prize.",1223916909

331182,comment,330981,331075,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Do I have to spell it out?<p>The observation is that sunscreen sales and melanoma rates are correlated. That's probably true, but it doesn't tell us anything about causation, one way or the other. Perhaps sunscreen is ineffective against melanoma. Or perhaps melanoma rates are rising because sunscreen use causes melanoma. Or perhaps sunscreen sales are rising <i>because</i> melanoma rates are rising. (As someone who has just watched a close relative die of metastatic melanoma, I assure you that the experience really inspires you to wear sunscreen and go to the dermatologist. Every time I get a pimple, I have to fight the desire to visit the emergency room.)<p>Perhaps sunscreen sales and melanoma rate would be completely unrelated, if they weren't both driven by an external cause. Perhaps they're both caused by population increases in the Sun Belt, or by other demographic changes.<p>Perhaps sunscreen is highly effective against melanoma, but there are still lots of older patients who got all their sun in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s before sunscreen was invented, and those patients are still getting melanoma at large rates. Or perhaps sunscreen is completely ineffective, but we won't know until the people who used it as kids reach their sixties. Or perhaps sunscreen <i>causes</i> melanoma... but it takes more than fifty years to do so.<p>Perhaps sunscreen causes autism! I guess that's what this article is trying to suggest.<p>As you can see, pulling hypotheses out of one's ass is easy to do, and it's fun for the whole family. It's also uninformative. <i>Scientific studies</i> would be informative. I'm sure there are lots and lots and lots of published studies which address hypotheses like these.

Really though, land is more expensive than ever before because there are more people than ever before.

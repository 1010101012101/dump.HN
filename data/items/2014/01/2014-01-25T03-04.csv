7119775,comment,7114913,7117979,3,0,Steuard,,,"First, an aside: the OP&#x27;s comment &quot;which has never been taken seriously&quot; about this topic is also entirely mistaken. Heck, I&#x27;ve heard that issue come up in serious conversation within the past year.<p>I&#x27;ve got to concur with the other people you&#x27;ve heard from: simultaneity in classical (Galilean) physics is the same for every observer, simultaneity in Special Relativity is different for observers moving with different velocities, and simultaneity in General Relativity often isn&#x27;t even globally well-defined for one observer at a time. That&#x27;s not too surprising given other features of GR. You&#x27;ve no doubt heard about &quot;gravitational lensing&quot;, where a large mass curves space so that &quot;straight&quot; light rays from the same distant object appear to come from two different directions. Now imagine the same thing happening to a &quot;line of simultaneity&quot;, and you&#x27;ll start to understand the issue.<p>I suspect that one concept that might satisfy a part of what you&#x27;re looking for as a &quot;generalization of simultaneity&quot; is a <i>Cauchy surface</i> or <i>Cauchy hypersurface</i>: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_surface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_surface</a>  This idea, essentially, is an arbitrary (possibly curved but everywhere spacelike) plane that divides time into &quot;future&quot; and &quot;past&quot;, and that can serve as an &quot;initial value surface&quot;. Have a look at that article for more information, and see if it&#x27;s something like what you&#x27;re looking for.<p>[Also: I don&#x27;t like the Copenhagen interpretation, either. I&#x27;ve become more of a &quot;many worlds&quot;/Everett person ever since a fantastic and highly mathematical quantum course in grad school, despite the somewhat uncomfortable philosophical issues with it.]",1390621977

7119770,comment,7114813,7114991,2,0,adrianwaj,,,"User and feature requests with an associated tip, and a way to follow-up that tip or request later, by either the sender or receiver.<p>So a user tips a dev for a project, and leaves a comment and/or feature request. Weeks later, the dev can see who has left the most tips, and/or when a person tips they can select from a bunch of feature requests or make a comment.<p>So expanding on a comment I left in another part of this thread, the site would be called &quot;follow up tip&quot; and users connect their soundcloud, youtube, github and other accounts. They leave a tip url on tracks, videos or projects: <a href=""http://followuptip.com/tipme/myusername"" rel=""nofollow"">http://followuptip.com/tipme/myusername</a><p>On that page, the site determines who the giver is (they&#x27;re signed in,) what the tip is about (the site connects the referring url to an underlying project or media.. or the user will manually select it from those imported upon signup (and updated/synced regularly)) and an address is generated on-the-fly, which is tracked for some payment (and can be auto-forwarded.)<p>On the other hand, a person may not tip at all to that address (it&#x27;s optional), but leave some message instead for a feature request or idea and then some bounty amount. The artist or developer then uses these requests to determine what to create/develop next, and they follow it up to all relevant tippers or requesters upon release/creation. &quot;I&#x27;ve just released that feature&quot; to which a tip can then be made against. Or, an artist (or video producer) can offer special release tracks first or the highest-quality downloads to their largest tippers who they message on a new track release. Or t-shirts or some exclusive merchandise can be provided for those who give over a certain amount.<p>The problem with blockchain addresses is there is no identity or username attached, and that&#x27;s one thing the reddit tipbot overcomes and has thus made it popular (it&#x27;s also publically visible too); and there&#x27;s no efficient way to do followup (which this idea aims to solve.) A tipper may be happy to tip again, as well as buy some product (ie become a customer,) or send some link to friends when released. (if these friends also make tips, then the send user can earn referral points)<p>Perhaps there could be a way to create a specific tip page with a certain yt, soundcloud, or github song/vid/project embedded that can be tweeted out or sent to people, and if a person wants to leave a tip, a blockchain address is generated on-the-fly for them. There could be browser plugin that generates a short-url for any page on aforementioned sites: a page with the song/vid/project already embedded for tipping.<p>Any tip received can have a commission taken by followuptip before depositing into site account or else forwarding.",1390621839

Speaking for myself, I certainly would; I never thought I&#x27;d see an e-mail signature worse than a paragraph of unenforceable legal disclaimer, but alas, I have.<p>One thing you&#x27;ve probably overlooked is that a significant majority of mail agents (a) discard HTML, making your carefully-formatted signature render in ways that you have not anticipated or dropping it altogether, and/or (b) do not thread and hide quotes the same way yours does. In addition, you&#x27;re now making me download and potentially display that signature every time you reply to me. On mobile, this can be a big deal in a deep thread where 70% of the data in a message could end up being your repeated signature.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that your workflow is top-posting and letting Gmail hide the repeated signature from you. That gets really unworkable, <i>really</i> quickly in any client that is not Gmail, particularly with a <i>huge</i> HTML signature that is repeated on every message. Since one of the primary topics of your publication is engineering types, you might find that this signature is doing you more harm than good with them.

Your signature basically says &quot;you are an inconvenience to me,&quot; by demonstrating that you&#x27;ve put a lot of thought into lowering the questions that you answer. I feel the same way about &quot;Before you e-mail me, please read this:&quot; and the other things overworked e-mailers ask me to do as a method of transferring work. I generally end up in a &quot;oh, you don&#x27;t want me to e-mail you? Okay!&quot; attitude when dealing with this sort of thing.<p>The signature lightly betrays that you do not generally value engaging with the people that e-mail you and turns me off to you, which might be hurting you with sources. We all hate e-mail, yet the best e-mail correspondents find ways to manage the workload without betraying that their conversational partner is an inconvenience to their life.

For example, to find a record in a 100 million record table with a unique key using sequential search would require on average a scan of 50 million records.  To access the same record when that key is indexed requires accessing/testing a maximum 23 or 24 entries in the index (2^23 is roughly 10M) and then direct access of the exact record needed in the table.  Indexes are used because they speed things up exponentially, even though it may be true that random access IO is much slower than sequential IO.<p>People, I suspect, also have much higher throughput when scanning sequentially compared to random access of items.  But imagine trying to find the single person in a copy of the Manhattan white pages (is there still such a thing?) with the name &#x27;Horace Greeley&#x27;.  Would you prefer to scan sequentially from the beginning (no use of an index) or make use of the fact that white page phone books are indexed by lastname, firstname?<p>Of course, because sequential scanning is so much faster than random access it will always be faster on tiny tables.  It will depend on the system and record size, but I&#x27;m guessing indexing will take over as faster method as table size grows beyond 5k records or so, give or take an order of magnitude. Not sure of exact numbers but you get the idea.  As number of records goes up from there the speed advantage of indexing over scanning grows at exponential rate.",1390619433

I add some salt.<p>Obviously, we wouldn&#x27;t call this &quot;cooking chicken&quot;, but I&#x27;m participating in the creation of my final meal.  We can add arbitrarily more, arbitrarily complex steps and ingredients.<p>It totally makes sense to say, &quot;this person is developing software&quot; or &quot;this person is cooking chicken&quot;.  What is rejected is the notion that eating the chicken means you&#x27;re not taking any role in shaping it except those roles explicitly given to you.<p>When I make boxed macaroni and cheese, I add nutmeg, and the result is way better.  It&#x27;s a good thing I have access to enough of the guts of the recipe to make that change (... or maybe it would be better if I ate less boxed macaroni and cheese, but I think you follow the metaphor).",1390618994

I&#x27;ve stayed a few summers in The Hamptons, Long Island---and humidity was a killer. I cannot imagine coping with 102 F / 94%.",1390618930

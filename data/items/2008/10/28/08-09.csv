We have one set of speakers we'd like to all play music through.<p>Ideally I imagine a box we can all copy mp3s to and then some sort of web interface for queueing selections?

346147,comment,345531,345726,0,0,jwilliams,,,"> if you can get 90% more performance up front with only 10% more effort, go for it.<p>Scale is only loosely related to performance.<p>You can have an application that performs pretty badly, but scales. This is much better than an application that performs well, but won't scale.<p>Performance tends to degrade slowly, while scale is usually a hard limit (you've reached ""n"" users? server crashes). Hitting an issue of scale is usually a fairly traumatic thing for a service.<p>I'd agree with the original comment that when you're starting you don't need fancy caching schemes, load balancers or replicated databases.<p>Equally you don't want to build something that is incompatible with these in the future. It's a terrible pain and is probably indicative of a bad design... As the other reply said quite well: <i>A good, simple design will allow you to move faster and scale better.</i>.<p>I'm a big fan of ""optimise last"", but I think this is often interpreted as ""put together badly and fix later""... It should really be ""quantify what you optimise"".",1225182008

346140,comment,345531,345652,0,0,drusenko,,,"keeping scaling in mind helps a lot, but the real problems you'll run into then are the ones you're not aware of... like a 32,000 directory limit on linux. as your application grows, you just get blindsided at random, and need to put out fires constantly.<p>and that's where experience with scaling comes in handy. if you don't have it, the next best thing you can do is to have a knowledgeable friend, read up on best practices, and deal with fires quickly.",1225181193

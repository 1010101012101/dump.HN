These days he's running the Long Now Foundation. My girlfriend and I are convinced he's a time traveller from the future.",1266681414

The good: I provide for my family of 5 by creating and maintaining web applications (an occupation non-existent at the time of my Univ. graduation); primarily because of the Internet I have a home office where, among other benefits, I have been set free from the unproductive, soulless cube-farm. Time would fail detailing other benefits such as enhancements in maps, search, discussion and in general increased access to knowledge.\nThe bad: too much trivial information; work is anytime, anywhere -- no hard boundaries; and temptation for attention sucking ( as the author stated ""this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth."") away offline life.<p>The ugly: pornography and perversion at a click; anonymous rage;<p>Like just about every area of life we need discipline and balance.",1266681226

1139055,comment,1137669,1138119,0,0,grellas,,,"With an agency, you need to consider the following:<p>1. As you note, they take a percentage of your billable rate, sometimes as high as 50%.<p>2. In most cases, you need to be a W-2 employee in relation to them and this means you get all of the drawbacks of being an employee without any of the benefits (agencies normally do not offer vacation time, health insurance, profit sharing, stock options, or other perks of employment).<p>3. You are regarded, in a sense, as an ""asset"" of the agency. In other words, the agency has a contract with the customer-company and that contract will prevent the company from hiring or contracting with you directly without paying the agency a ""non-circumvention"" fee. (I know - we have represented many such agencies over the years and protecting this area is always one of their foremost concerns). Thus, your future opportunities with the company you do work for are made dependent on the company's willingness to pay the agency, e.g., a fee equal to six month's of your services before they can do anything with you directly, making you far less marketable.<p>4. Though they classify you as an employee, some agencies insert a clause in your written contract stating that you get paid only when they get paid. This is plainly illegal if you are their employee but they do will sometimes do it anyway. In that case, or in the case where you are a contractor in relation to them, the effect of such a clause is to put the compensation for your services at collection risk. That is, the agency might decide to string you or stiff you even after they get paid on account of your work for the customer. None of this would happen, of course, if you were allowed to contract directly with the customer.<p>All this and more is pretty negative for the tech service provider and leaves him vulnerable to getting used and manipulated in various ways. Of course, agencies will vary and some are better than others but inherent problems remain even with the best of them. In a sense, the tax laws have made them a toll gate between you as a service provider and your true customer and there is no way of getting to your customer without paying a price of some kind, one that would not need to be paid but for the arbitrary quirk in tax laws.",1266679051

1139051,comment,1138269,1138910,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"No clue to be honest with you. WordPress is a fine platform to use for just blogging, publishing content, etc. There is big focus on it looking neat and clean. It is slow as all hell, but installing WP Supercache turns it into what I think of an cohesive, database backed, static site. It becomes a slow HTML editor that is a lot easier to use than the previous generation editors such as Dreamweaver et al.<p>When I say that the code inside of WP is awful, I mean that you should not look at it and you should not try to change it. Don't try to make WP into something it's not, like running custom applications on top of it, etc. When somebody tells you they want to integrate something with WordPress: run. However, I use it as a simple web publishing platform and it gets the job done.",1266678728

PHP code that I've seen from pre-PHP5 times does all sorts of funky things to get around the shortcomings of the language. I guess at that point what b2 had was considered pretty good. I think the most important thing that needs to happen with any software project is peer review. If a piece of code is even mildly important, it needs to be reviewed, modified and distilled until it is ready. That did not appear to happen with WP.",1266678222

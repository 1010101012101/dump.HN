Ask for a simpler feature. On the first day you may be given a feature to work on. As you look at the code you&#x27;ll get a sense of whether it&#x27;s doable in the first day versus two weeks. If its too big ask for lower hanging fruit. This shows you really care about adding value from day one.<p>2. If 1 doesn&#x27;t work ask someone to pair with you. It can be super awkward if you&#x27;re not used to it and you&#x27;ll probably have to fight some impostor syndrome but the ability to be humble and ask for help is something a lot of companies/team appreciate. Just try to limit the sessions to 30 minutes to no more than an hour. You don&#x27;t want your head to explode. This also provides value to a team member because it allows them to work through explaining the code as well as seeing the existing code from someone else&#x27;s eyes.<p>3. Communicate, communicate, communicate. 1 and 2 already imply this but when people are let go because they&#x27;re &quot;not the right fit&quot; its often because they didn&#x27;t build relationships with the rest of the team. Communicate what your confused about. Communicate what your excited about. If you&#x27;ve already been hired, then you should already be in an environment where people are receptive to you.<p>4. Ask a ton of questions. What tools are everyone using? How do they feel about TDD? How does this thing work? Through your questions the rest of the team may find bugs or things that need to be refactored.<p>5. Document everything you were confused about. If you were \nconfused about something in the code then most likely the next person coming onboard will be too.",1391777570

I will explain below.<p>> This is demonstrably false.<p>While I would not necessarily agree with the validity view you said, I don&#x27;t think it is demonstrably false.  Please <i>demonstrate</i> that it is false in a way <i>unbiased by your own cultural assumptions of autonomy.</i><p>> The fact that Russians support each other via a traditional heterosexual family unit does not in any way mean that someone who is gay should be discriminated against.<p>Define discriminated against.  Is a retire-with-the-kids culture where parents get to say no to spousal choices (but won&#x27;t if he&#x27;s made her pregnant) inherently discriminatory?<p>> The whole premise of your argument is that gays cannot retire with children, so they will be a burden upon the state.<p>No.  My point was that same-sex couples <i>can&#x27;t have equality</i> if only opposite-sex couples get a veto override (via &quot;accidental&quot; pregnancy) against parental objections.  If equality is the goal, one cannot tolerate a retire with the kids culture because parents have so much power over childrens&#x27; choice of marriage partners, and this is <i>inherently</i> greater with regard to same-sex couples.<p>I don&#x27;t think you read what I wrote very carefully.<p>As for the cultural validity piece, as I said, I would come back to it.  I don&#x27;t think it can be <i>demonstrated</i> to be false, because cultures function in different ways to the point where apples to apples comparisons are essentially impossible, and so any comparison comes from assumptions, passed on by culture, which determine the conclusion.  But at the same time there are certain problems that can&#x27;t be easily addressed by a position of pure cultural relativity.  In my view, these come in two forms:  inter-group disputes and breakdown of institutions.<p>The first includes things like intercontinental slave trade, Germany gassing Polish Jews, Japan&#x27;s brutal treatment of various occupied areas in WWII, colonial treatment of Africa and Asia, treatment of Native Americans by the US government, etc.  You can&#x27;t solve an intergroup dispute by assuming that both sides are valid actors, so what one is left with is a political resolution.<p>The second issue is the question of the breakdown of institutions.  If a practice is perfectly valid in a culture, then institutions should be perfect, but they aren&#x27;t anywhere.  I think that critique of cultural institutions from a context sympathetic to the culture is a worthwhile endeavor.",1391777018

In general I think it is easy to judge someone half a world away and it is very hard to get things right when looking across cultural barriers.  I am going to give my perspective here as an American living in Indonesia and married to a Chinese-Indonesian.<p>One of the key issues that nobody looks at when they talk about this is very distinctly a collective lifestyle choice:  retirement living and who retirees live with.  This is undoubtedly a collective lifestyle choice, and societies tend to fall in one of two groups: retire with the kids (the international norm) or retire with the spouse.<p>This has tremendous implications for views on reproduction and hence sexuality.  Not only is childlessness not a viable personal choice in retire-with-the-children cultures but same-sex couples <i>can never have equality</i> in such cultures.  Even if you revert the controversial laws in Russia, they would be replaced with very binding social pressures that are not easily resisted.<p>Part of the reason is that as soon as the norm is that people retire with the kids, and as soon as this expectation is set, then parents get (and find ways to make actionable) a legitimate interest in who their children marry.  This means that parents effectively have something nearly like a veto power over childrens&#x27; spousal choices but that veto can be overridden by &quot;accidental&quot; pregnancy.  This fact effectively dooms the notion of equal rights for same-sex couples in such cultures, and in the end one is, I think, forced either to recognize an equivalent to social security payments as a human right or concede that actual access to same-sex marriage is not one.<p>Russia is in the retire-with-the-kids category, and as a result they have a strong interest in maintaining a sort of traditional family structure that has all but disappeared in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, etc, namely the multi-generation household.  On the other hand, for cultures where the primary human contact in retirement is the spouse, then it is deeply unfair to deny people the choice of that relationship for whatever reason they want to spend that time with someone of the same sex (and the reason really is unimportant at that point).<p>As an American living in another retire-with-the-kids culture, I will say that such systems work and work out well for everyone, but that isn&#x27;t a reason to perpetuate gross unfairness in the US.<p>So I stand in the awkward place of saying that most Western countries probably should look at legalizing same-sex marriage, but that a gay rights movement really would be deeply socially disruptive in a really bad way in much of the world (including Russia).<p>Like it or not, if we ever succeeded in remaking the world in the American image, we&#x27;d destroy the planet.

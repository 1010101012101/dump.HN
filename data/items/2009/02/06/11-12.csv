You can also often find used office furniture dealers in your area via a Google search for the same.<p>For whiteboards you can also use a large piece of glass (mounted on a standing frame, or against a wall).<p>FYI, I bought a roll of ""whiteboard vinyl"" a few years back at another startup with the intention of covering the walls in a conference room with it to make huge whiteboard areas.  It sucked, don't waste your money.  If the walls are not glass-smooth all the little bumps come through and make it a bitch to write on or erase.",1233921443

It has to be possible to 'crack' this problem somehow.<p>The problems that I've seen listed so far enumerated are:<p>- class hierarchy\n- groupthink\n- feedback loops\n- old hands vs newcomers (aka the incrowd problem)<p>I'll go back through all the stuff that was said on this subject and see if I can dig up more. It's a very interesting problem, possibly one of the most interesting ones that I have seen in a long time, it is worthy of a serious study.",1233921118

Yet I've always wanted to eat nice things. That's what's so great about ads: they provide information about good stuff.",1233921010

But ultimately, when the Pontiff is ill he's going to go to a doctor, not rely on prayer alone, when a doctor is ill he's going to see a doctor, not pray at all (other than maybe that his collegue is sober during surgery).<p>One of the greatest tragedies of our time is happening right now in Africa, and if it was up to the Catholic church it would be a lot bigger than it is already. (HIV/AIDS spread because of a lack of / refusal to use condoms).<p>I honestly wished that these so called 'spiritual leaders' would recognize the limitations of their knowledge and act accordingly, they might even win back some of the respect they've lost.",1233920729

It's good cause Saas is tricky to explain to most non-tech people.",1233920727
469627,comment,469320,469592,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I'm not really sure what I believe here, but I'm going to make the argument of true believer in the powers of market forces. The purist objection here would be that you need to follow through; get out of the market's way further down the chain.<p>If you choose to reward achievement, you have to measure achievement. If achievement is measured by standardized testing, then people will game the metrics. However, if the market chooses the testing procedures, it will reward metrics which are harder to game. This would take several iterations (read: many years) to stabilize, but it should converge on some sort of solution.<p>I think the fundamental problem here is forcing the market to not become complacent. This sort of thing needs to be done like a genetic algorithm. Every state tries a different testing procedure and then tests cross-pollinate and evolve under the pressure of market forces. There would need to be some way to reward experimentation as well, so that we don't wind up with one homogenized solution that stops progressing; there would need to be ""random mutations"".",1233920652

469622,comment,469320,469592,0,0,patio11,,,"""Quality"", ""design"", and ""beauty"" are all very subjective things and the market regularly gives options incorporating all of them.  I see no reason why ""educational attainment"" would be any harder.  (Imagine a future in which two schools got into a Mac vs. PC war: ""Sure, you could go to Boring Prep.  And you'll learn to read and do calculus.  Yeah yeah, boring.  Come to Trendy Fashionable High, where we nurture your mind holistically... and also have mandatory gym class so you look like this svelte model.""  Seeing that ad would give me about as much joy as a staunch Boring Prep grad is capable of feeling in his shrunken, blackened heart.)<p>>>\nPupils below-but-close-to a grade increment are given more intensive teaching at the expense of those who will attain the relevant grade left to their own devices.\n>><p>I could think of worse outcomes than public schools discovering triage.  Academic triage, like medical triage, would probably result in more survivors.  I mean, we're certainly not effectively educating the highest risk students now: if making that explicit saves education for the average folks who share the same classrooms, well, that is a price I'm willing to pay.",1233920116

In the case of Requests, it is just a wrapper on the stdlib. There is nothing in Requests you can't do in the stdlib, ditto pretty much everything.<p>As far as lxml goes, there are a ton of XML parsing/query libraries out there. In lxml's case it is built on libxml2. I believe there is another library that is also build on libxml2, however lxml has better syntax for the most part. Should it be in the standard library? Probably not, it depends on a pretty heavy weight C library and most people don't really need it. When you do, you use it.<p>I have no idea what is going on with the simplejson business. I just use the json lib.<p>I don't see anything wrong with subprocess or the threading libraries. They do what they need to do. I use subprocess quite often, it works fine. It is way better than the actual legacy version (in the os library).",1319000290

3128785,comment,3128302,3128302,1,0,VuongN,,,"Background: I did a 100k+ users web app using cakePHP and was very happy with it (2 years ago).  Now a day, I use Django/Python as my main weapon of choice when I am thinking about complex web application.  For simpler sites/CMS, I'm actually giving wordpress a try.<p>My thoughts on your question: I am a developer first, so I tend to forget the most important part of the business-have one! If your product isn't launched, you don't have a business just yet.  Therefore, if using cakePHP can get your stuff out faster and with a simpler server setup, go for it.  If you're comfortable with both (Django & CakePHP), then choose Python.  It's easier to fix a painting when you make the first stroke.  It's that blank canvas that scares us all.  Go ahead, make the first stroke.  Do the prototype in PHP if you can do it faster.  Once the logic is written in one language, it doesn't take that long to redo it in another language.  At least that's how my experience had been.<p>Good luck and hope you resolve your disagreement soon.  There's no time to waste.",1319000126

3128690,comment,3128320,3128484,171,0,teej,,,"There's a lot of complexity here I'm going to attempt to simplify.  Apologies in advance if I glossed over any important details.<p>It all starts with what Malaria has evolved to do.  The lifecycle of malaria requires both a mosquito and a human.  It gets into a female mosquito, hangs out in her gut until she bites a human, jumps into the human and hangs out there for a while mucking about, and then jumps back to a different mosquito.<p>If malaria straight-up killed its host, it wouldn't transmit itself on to the next one.  This means malaria must be really good at two things: keeping its host walking around and going undetected for as long as possible.  It has lots of tricks it uses to stay under the radar.  This all makes sense because the longer it can stay in the host, the more likely it'll get picked up by something else.  Think of malaria like a spy that's infiltrated your population.  You know one of your civilians is killing the others, but you can't figure out who.<p>It's also important to know HOW vaccinations work.  There are four golden strategies used today:<p>- Put a dead bugger in the body.<p>- Put a neutered bugger in the body.<p>- Put the bugger's coat (a virus-like particle) in the body.<p>- Put the bugger's perfume (a protein marker) in the body.<p>All four of these strategies work the same way.  Your body recognizes an intruder and teaches itself how to eliminate the threat.<p>We've established that malaria is good at going undetected.  This renders the first two strategies ineffective.  Even if we did introduce dead/neutered malaria into the body, the body will still have a hard time finding it when real Malaria enters the system.<p>We can't use the third strategy because Malaria isn't a virus.  That leaves us with only one option: a perfume (subunit) vaccine.<p>A subunit vaccine is a vaccine where you take the perfume of a bugger and give it to the body saying ""Anything that smells like this, you should probably deal with"".  These are difficult vaccines to put together.   Proteins, like perfume, are a carefully constructed thing and are hard to perfectly replicate.  Plus, given their complex nature, the body can get confused and build ineffective defenses since it's only given a protein to work with.<p>On top of all this, the malaria bugger goes through three different stages of its life while in the human body.  If you target it late stage, you'll prevent further transmission but the human could still die.  You want to target it early stage, preventing transmission AND protecting the human from symptoms.  Unfortunately, your body only has 5 minutes from being bitten to to find the bugger and kick its ass before he effectively vanishes from sight.<p>So where does that leave us?  We have a spy entering our country.  We are already doing everything we can to destroy his transit before he enters our borders (spraying with DEET to kill mosquitos).  We need to catch him before he masquerades as a citizen, otherwise we will never find him.  So our only option is to look for signs of a spy and ruthlessly eliminate anything that fits the bill.<p>That's what RTS,S/AS01 does.  In the 80s we were able to produce a protein from the malaria sporozoite (the first stage inside the human body) to get a small level of immunity in humans.  The problem since then has been ramping up the immune response.  The body needs to act fast (within 5 minutes of being infected) and with extreme prejudice (wiping out the sporozoites) off of very little training (a single sporozoite protein).  Vetting this vaccination is also tricky, since it requires human field testing in Africa.<p>In other words, this vaccine is the culmination of 50 years of dedication, research, and hard work.  It's also a miracle of modern science.  Most importantly, it will save a LOT of human lives.",1318998307

In terms of food, art, language (is there a more contextual language?), and engineering, Japan very much has an island-nation use-limited-resources-and-achieve-great-things approach.<p>The website thing that you mentioned is true. .jp websites are TERRIBLE in UX. I wonder if there is some part of Japanese culture that wants to embrace complexity for it's own sake.<p>And, let's be honest, the US/EU/Everywhere-Else designs for phones weren't very good pre-iPhone either. It had the same complexity problems and close to the same UX ridiculousness that the Japanese phones had. Perhaps it's a human thing, to marvel at too much to comprehend and consider it a good thing.<p>That being said, if any company were to come up with an iPhone, I would think it would be a Japanese one. But Japan is very traditional and Apple is unique in that it disregards a lot of conventions. I think this might be to Japan's detriment. I don't feel that they've embraced the current approach to UX, they are still stuck in the ""complexity = more features = better"" days of the Web during the dot-com-boom days (aka ancient history).<p>I hope there are some Japanese entrepreneurs out there ready to shake things up, the cultural seeds are already there for beautiful and elegant products.",1318997092

2328627,comment,2327313,2327313,0,0,haberman,,,"I agree completely with the premise, which is that Parsing looks like a solved problem but really isn't.<p>One thing that should be a red flag is that lots of people still write parsers manually instead of using tools.  GCC migrated <i>from</i> a yacc/bison-based parser <i>to</i> a hand-written recursive descent parser.  I used to work in the same office as Bob Jervis who wrote Turbo C back in the day, and he said he never uses parser generators.  Clearly something is wrong if the tools that have all the weight of the theory and formalisms are losing to coding parsers by hand.<p>I disagree that because computers are so much faster we should use less-efficient parsing algorithms that can handle all grammars (like Earley, GLR, etc).  One reason I disagree is the ambiguity problem given in the article.  The very process of building parse tables for a more restricted language subset like LL, LR, etc. can tell you that a grammar is not ambiguous, which is hugely beneficial.  If you do not restrict yourself to such a subset, you never know whether your grammar has ambiguities or not.  To me, this would be like programming in a language that doesn't give you syntax errors when you make a mistake.  Sure, the syntax errors are annoying, but they are your only way of knowing you need to fix something!<p>(By the way, PEGs have the same issue -- by using prioritized choice, you never know when you're covering up an ambiguity.  An example of this is C's famous ""if/else"" ambiguity.  It's important to know that this ambiguity exists, because you have to tell your users about it.)<p>Instead of using our extra CPU power to parse with less efficient algorithms, I think we should use our extra CPU power to integrate parsing more deeply into our editors/IDEs.  With a fast parsing algorithm, you could parse as a programmer types, unlike the current syntax highlighting editors which use only rough pattern matching instead of having a real parse tree.  Imagine seeing syntax errors the moment you type them.  Imagine having your cursor inside a struct and having a little ""inspector"" pane off to the side that says ""sizeof(struct MyStruct) = 96"".  Imagine getting real, context-sensitive completion even for complex languages like C++.  <i>That's</i> what we should be spending CPU cycles on IMO.<p>The biggest thing that could be improved about parsing IMO is for grammars to be reusable.  There is no reason that people should have to roll their own parser for a common language.  There's no way you're going to get all the edge cases right unless you spend a LOT of time on it, but why should you have to do that?  IMO there should be a ""grammar library"" the same way that platforms like the JVM or .NET have a ""class library.""  You should be able to take a C++ parser off-the-shelf and use it in your program, thereby saving yourself literally man-years of work.<p>I've been working for a long time on a project that seeks to achieve this goal.  It's tabled right now because of my work on a protocol buffer implementation (the two will be related in a deep way; protocol buffers are an ideal way of specifying parse trees, which are the output of a parser), but I am extremely motivated to return to it.<p><a href=""http://www.reverberate.org/gazelle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reverberate.org/gazelle/</a>

2328602,comment,2326502,2327580,0,0,jerf,,,"""The 7 tones that make up a major scale are basically a cultural artifact of western music (which goes back to gregorian chant). Other cultures have more/fewer tones.""<p>It's difficult to draw the line between culture and biology, but that's probably too far to the ""cultural"" side. There is a basis for those, which is that if you start on the base tone of C and run around the circle of fifths you'll get the white keys first: C -> G -> D -> A -> E -> B -> F#, and you get F by going down from the base tone. The importance of the fifth itself comes from the fact that the first harmonic of the base tone is one octave up, and the next harmonic is very close to an octave and a fifth with equal temprement. This seems more than coincidence.<p>I also find this a better explanation for why so many cultures pick this up once they are exposed to it. (Which is not to say they give up all their old harmonies but this tuning+scale has certainly gone global.) I really have a hard time imagining the mechanics of the Western Global Harmonic Imperialist Conspiracy; it seems much more likely that it so happens that people we call Westerners found this local optima first and it spread because humans in general like it, and it belongs to all humanity, not ""the West"", just like ""perspective"" and mathematics.",1300211592

POST, PUT, DELETE always have side effects.<p>Except those are of course guidelines, the API implementor is free to entirely disregard them (much to the danger of everybody)<p>> For one thing, it makes your API actually simpler, since you don't actually need a list of 'methods' like rdio has, all you need to know is the representations and methods stay the same—which should be natural if you know HTTP.<p>Instead of a list of methods, you get a list of methods (which do <i>not</i> have to stay the same, by the way) and a tree of resources.

varying timer speeds of either 15.6ms or 10ms.  The reason for this variance is 
because FF3 uses the default windows timer mechanisms by default; which have a 15.6ms 
clock granularity.  However, these timers are influenced by the system-wide 
timeGetTime() API.  Flash, Quicktime, and Windows Media all set timeBeginPeriod(1), 
which changes the clock resolution to 1ms.  In this case, FF then applies a clamp to 
avoid sub-10ms timers.  This can be tested by starting with a blank system w/ only FF 
running, and using this tool: <a href=""http://ejohn.org/apps/timers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/apps/timers/</a>  Then load youtube (flash 
causes the beginTimePeriod to be called) in a background tab and run your test again.  
You'll see the clock speed drop from 15ms to 10ms.  So, as you can see, a web

Here are some frequent use cases where LaTeX blows a text processor out of the water.<p>* Bibliography. The median article length in our field is 30+ pages, with reference lists of 60+ not uncommon. Maintaining these in Word/OO is a nightmare, even with (non-free) bibliography software. RefTeX allows me to find and insert citations in a matter of three keystrokes, and whenever I reshuffle the reference list I'm 100% sure it's in order (i.e. everything I cite in the text is in the references and there are no uncited references)<p>* We don't use math, but we do use a lot of tree-like diagrams. Drawing these by hand is a chore; using logical markup to get trees which need zero to very little tuning saves enormous amounts of time and frustration.<p>* Floats and numbered examples. TeX floats are notoriously unreliable, but seriously, are Word's any better? And it gets worse with numbered examples (and pictures in numbered examples). For instance, a frequent feature of linguistics papers is an interlinear gloss: two or three lines of elements that have to line up with each other. These involve tables or tab stops in a word processor, and are notoriously fragile (e. g. if your sentence doesn't fit on one line, you get horrible issues with breaking lines).<p>All this is in addition to the common advantages like keeping track of numbering. These are all things that <i>can</i> be done with a word processor, but usually require significant amounts of time and self-discipline.<p>A lot of people in our department use LaTeX; most are not of the ""programming"" type, and are not deeply ""into"" LaTeX, interacting with the very basics and using some googling and copy-pasting.

The black keys are the ""in-between"" half steps that do not appear in the C-major scale.

Tuning matters most for old keyboard music, as in, pre-Beethoven.<p>The reason keys are important is because many instruments have different sound qualities for different notes. Keys close to E minor or G major allow guitarists to get that ""twangy"" open string sound. You can get a richer sound tuning up, or a thinner ""heavy metal"" sound tuning down. Keys close to B-flat allow brass players to use more basic tones on their instruments. All singers have certain sound qualities that are only available on certain notes. ""Every Breath You Take"", for example, would sound different even a semitone off, because Sting's transition from his creepy baritone to his high-pitched whine happens at a very specific part of his range, and the creepy quality of his voice contrasted with the high-pitched pleas for love is one of the most important qualities of the song.<p>But, yeah, temperament nowdays is almost irrelevant.",1300208912

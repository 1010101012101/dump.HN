This is caused by a high fixed cost associated with even interacting with a lawyer.

If you are born in Dec., you are the youngest.<p>What a really fascinating topic. I'm reading all this because I now have a 4 month old son (born in early November) and an older nephew born in early January of the same year. My nephew can walk now and my son just drools and hates tummy time - and they will be going to the same school and same grade! Eek.<p>I thought for sure my son would be at a disadvantage but I realized that both my sister and I were skipped 1 grade when we were 3 and 3.5 years old. (Side note: we did not attend a North American system.) We were always the youngest in class. She was physically the same as the other girls, but I was smaller, so I always lacked confidence growing up as I was always the smallest AND youngest. Thankfully in high school I hit a growth spurt and reached nearly 6 feet. Skinny, but still - I was tall.<p>Both my sister and I turned out just fine. We always had good marks and went to university. She even has more credentials. We are both extremely social, and she is very mature in the sense that she can negotiate and do business with people with far more experience than her. So no issues there.<p>All this to say, both of us were skipped grades and we turned out just fine, and we always tried to achieve more than others in our class, and we have more often than not. So if there are any parents out there with young children, don't worry so much about your child being the youngest in the class. Simply reassure them when they it looks like they lack self-confidence and they'll be fine. This is not scientific, nor can I really remember how I felt when I was 4 years old. Just wanted to give anyone else a point of view from a simple grade-skipper who gets bored easily :)",1331088404

His website HackThisSite is a sort of propaganda and training tool used to entice young black hats to join his cause.<p>You can find a list of his previous run-ins with the law on his wikiepdia page: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond</a> (My favorite is where he attacked a 70-year-old holocaust denier that was having dinner at a restaurant.... what productive direct action!)<p>He claims he steals his power, water and internet access and at times squats abandoned buildings and eats ""freegan"" so he isn't helping the capitalist system flourish. At the same time he kept a part-time computer programming job to make spare cash. So he can keep fighting the good fight against capitalism.<p>I think he may have still been on probation during the events of the Stratfor hack, so he may be royally fucked by the prosecution unless he too snitches - something he has repeatedly said is the worst thing any good hacktivist can do.<p>He's one of the longest-running jokes my online friends and I have. His rants against ""the system"" and hypocritical actions which seem to have little purpose serve to foster flame wars and is frequently banned when people get tired of his shit. He then comes back and threatens to ""curbstomp"" or ""shiv"" anyone who disliked or banned him. Basically, nobody but the LulzSec freaks like this guy.<p>Yet again the same people who try to get away with petty online crime get caught due to negligence, bragging and misplaced trust in other criminals. If only they'd learn that trusting a criminal is probably not a good idea they might not be arrested right now.<p>edit: In case anyone wants to verify this account (in a WikiLeaks-style full transparency way), here is a brief dump of a public chatroom on a public irc server of his comments.

3674008,comment,3673462,3673940,7,0,andolanra,,,"1. ""Nude Body Scanners"" is a common name for the backscatter machines, and is generally understood as such. I'm not sure if you're asserting that people are randomly upvoting this article on the off chance it contains naughty material, but quite a few peoplehere and elsewhereare heavily interested and involved in the TSA's use of these machines due to their isolated and cumulative effects on civil rights, so it shouldn't be surprising that it's at the top.<p>2. The TSA is not the only system keeping terrorists off planes. We don't have a ""double-blind survey"" where half the airports were protected by the TSA and the other half weren't, so we can't make any kind of sensible comparison. (A better metric would be, ""How many attempted terrorist attacks were directly <i>stopped</i> by the TSA during the airport security checks,"" and it's widely accepted that the answer is, ""None."")<p>3. These new backscatter machines were not put in place immediately in 2001. A great deal of the time you've mentioned involved elevated security on the part of the TSA, but not specifically through the measures being discussed here, which <i>decrease</i> the actual security of the planes by allowing people to bring items through that would have been caught by earlier measures (c.f. the article being discussed.) A case can be made that the TSA's post-9/11 response has been useless and possibly harmful, but this article is specifically making the point that the backscatter machines are problematic.<p>4. There have also been zero hijackings in <i>other</i> countries, as well, and those countries have different (and usually much less invasive and less expensive) security measures. If we provisionally accept that it <i>is</i> the TSA, and not the other agencies involved, that is preventing attacks, why does it necessarily follow that the <i>only way</i> to keep planes safe is the drastic measures taken by the TSA? (I can quite easily rid my house of mosquitos by burning it down, but that doesn't mean the <i>only</i> or <i>best</i> way to keep my house free of mosquitos is arson.)",1331087682

And then they took it way, way too far, to the point where whenever I see a ""new JQuery plugin to do X"" I just look the other way.<p>JQuery just gets in the way these days.<p>$(""#element"") is an anti-pattern.  That code should just return the DOM node, not some silly object with unknown attributes.  We're way past the point where you need to abstract the entire document object model, and I argue you should never have done that to begin with.",1331085760

A simpler argument against the scanners is that they <i>fundamentally</i> are less effective at detecting major threats than are metal detectors.  Thus whatever minimal security holes they close, they open up larger ones.  Moreover these are inherent in the technology so it isn't a question of just fixing a few things.<p>I am not entirely anti-AIT.  I think the machines can have a place, for those for whom there is some reasonable suspicion of wrong-doing, and following a metal detector.  But the way they are implemented poses severe privacy and security problems, as if someone decided you could solve security problems by buying fancy machines (an unfortunately common problem).<p>The problem is that as long as the federal government sets standards for airport security, this will be a problem.  It doesn't matter if it is the TSA or the NTSB making these decisions--- big corporations will pay lobbyists to get the message to them that their machines are better than the old stuff and therefore should be used in this way.  It matters even less if the TSA agents are doing the screening or not, except that with them monopolizing that market there are fewer voices against.",1331085699

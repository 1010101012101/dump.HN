Donating to NPR?<p>The point is that we're not necessarily talking about ""tips"" in the sense of ""additional personal gratuity on top of an existing purchase"". Very often, in this context, it involves making a donation towards efforts of someone you appreciate as, perhaps, the sole means of funding a project.<p>I agree that I probably wouldn't be so keen on a service that encourages tipping people during an existing transaction. For example, I likely wouldn't tip a tech support rep for a company I host through (well, unless they went above and beyond in an overwhelming way).<p>But I sure as hell think it's great to be able to pay a little to those who otherwise get absolutely nothing (other than a bit of respect).<p>Just as I might buy lunch at work for a coworker who saved me a lot of time out of their generosity, I'd like to periodically pay back those who make my life easier out of the kindness of their hearts.<p>For this purpose, I think TipJoy is one of the best alternatives I've seen for online ""appreciation"" donations.

195491,comment,188489,188489,0,0,jimbob3450,,,"I find the idea of innocence to be interesting. In a child it seems to be a lack of awareness of the consequences of their own actions.<p>This is brilliantly illustrated by the TV show ""the Simpson's"" where the roles of Bart and Homer are reversed for the most part. Bart generally understands the consequences of his actions whereas Homer doesn't have a clue. Homer is the innocent in this case.<p>I find this definition of ""child-like"" innocence pretty robust, it seems to fit with most of my experiences. Knowlege is what destroys this form of innocence, not evil, so it explains a lot of the lies that we tell. Adults vicariously enjoy the hope of their children and fear that telling them the ""truth"" will spoil the vision.<p>With my kids (I have 5 kids and 2 grandkids) I have tried to be as honest as possible but when you understand the ""truth"" to be very complex it becomes difficult to provide a simplified view that a child can fully understand (especially when you know you don't fully understand it either). A partially understood truth may be as misleading as an out-and-out lie but more difficult to unravel.<p>Another reason adults like to preserve the ""innocence"" of their children is that it reminds them of when they had hope and helps them relive or rediscover it.",1211329927

195488,comment,195085,195445,0,0,krschultz,,,"That is a ridiculously stupid argument. Cars & hard hats  you buy when you are 17-18+, i.e an adult. Education starts when you are 3. Are you going to penalize every kid whose parents decided buying a new car was more important than getting the better school? Sure some parents will make rational choices and send them off to great schools, but many will take the cheap route. At least right now the default, free, school is the one that MOST people go to. It is the exception to be paying to go elsewhere. If you find the fastest way to separate the classes in America, this is it. Next thing you will say is ""but there will be vouchers it will be all equal"", sure except that the bar before was $0 for public education out of my pocket vs 20,000 a year for private. Few would make that leap, except those with piles of money. So now everyone is making the leap, and you know what will be the differentiation? Not money, but skill. It will be competitive. Who will get into the best elementary schools? The kids whose parents push them, because who at that age makes decisions out side of their parents will. And then they will get further ahead than the school with the lower achieving kids, and so it begins. By high school you totally separate curriculum, one that is significantly more advanced than the other, and the kids have totally different chances of getting into college. Decisions at age 10 by their parents suddenly have impacted their life, sounds like a great improvement to me! If you don't think it happens, compare Wilmington Charter to the rest of Delaware, their acceptance rates to colleges, the racial makeup of the school, it is atrocious.",1211329506

195484,comment,195423,195423,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Both web frameworks will help you rapidly create a web site, so they are approximately equivalent (though not exactly, of course.) So also consider the language you'd be using. Look at Ruby and Python, and see which you prefer.<p>I personally prefer Python's syntax and style, Python has many more libraries and it's been around longer than Ruby, and I've noticed that among ""top"" tier coders they tend to prefer it over Ruby. (Not all, but most.) But Ruby has many strengths, and can do a few tricks that Python can't, to it's credit. Python apps tend to execute faster than Ruby apps. It appears to be easier to scale up Django/Python apps than Ruby/Rails apps, though a lot of the same techniques can be used for both since they're language/framework agnostic (using a clustered architecture with a scalable number of server nodes, caching aggressively, choosing good algorithms, etc.)<p>I was at the same decision point over a year ago, did both tutorials, and decided I needed to focus more on the languages to help break what might otherwise have been a tie. With either framework you'll be a lot better off than the typical ""web COBOL"" stack: Java + Servlet/JSP + XML.",1211329237

195479,comment,195423,195423,0,0,1gor,,,"You have two things to consider: Python vs. Ruby and Rails vs. Django.<p>Steve Yegge has made a good write-up on languages:  <a href=""http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/tour-de-babel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/tour-de-babel</a>. Steve is a top notch programmer with brains and eloquence.  He was one of the first hackers at Amazon. Now he works at Google, and Google has chosen Python and JavaScript as company languages. Which has pissed off Steve quite a bit, because he has firmly decided that Ruby is more powerful and rewarding than Python. But he's not allowed to program in Ruby at work.<p>So, Steve has engineered a kind of 'JavaScript on Rails' in order to fit into Google. All to avoid programming in Python. JavaScript is more powerful and elegant than Python, as he sees it.<p>This gives you two clues. One about Ruby and second about the Rails. To be brutally honest, Lisp is the most powerful and beautiful language to approach a programming problem. But List is not the most practical choice because of lack of libraries and dialect balkanisation. Ruby is considered to be an 'acceptable Lisp'. Almost as powerful and much more practical. And very very elegant. You may hear a lot about Ruby being slow. That is true, but that is also changing fast. Make your own research. You'll hear some interesting thoughts about what 'programmers' time' is worth vs. 'processor time' etc.<p>Finally, the frameworks. Rails has been mercilessly hyped, but the fact remains -- it is a framework for programmers. It has digested lots of 'theorizing' from Java and Smalltalk space. It tried to answer the question: ""What an ideal MVC framework would be?"" The answer turned out to be surprisingly good.<p>Django is a clever framework, but it has arisen from a particular website (Lawrence Journal-World) and it still has roots in website page design. Nothing wrong with that, but programmers talk less about Django (just check IBM tech articles), there is less programming 'meat' in there. There are also much lesser number of plugins and hacks for Django. You do not have the same amount of books and general enthusiasm about Django platform, comparing to Rails. Not by any objective measure.<p>Now let Python fanboys kill me, but I went through the same analysis a couple of years ago and I came firmly in favour of Ruby and later in favour of Rails. And I have not been disappointed a bit ever since.",1211329049

Python will help get rid of some bad habits you may have picked up from PHP (though Ruby might do this as well).

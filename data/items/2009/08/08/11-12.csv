Google does not intend to make money directly out of Android sales and just about all the applications users buy are proprietary. It's more or less the same as someone buying Oracle to run on Linux - the OS is open-source, but the application is not.",1249732321

If it succeeds at that, its future is going to be very bright.\nCydia will never be as popular and/or successful as the AppStore. But then again, it never was supposed to be. Cydia is supposed to be an open platform welcomming any kind of developer without restrictions and/or fees. The idea itself is meant for an outsider-position. Saurik is doing an awesome job at maintaining the Cydia store, but his much more important work consists in bringing *nix software to the iPhone platform. Cydia is only one of these advantages ;-)",1249729498

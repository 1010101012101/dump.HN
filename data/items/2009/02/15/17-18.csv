Metal core of the Earth is producing magnetic shield. All that is created due to collision of Earth with large object, which is comparable to Earth, and capturing it.<p>It is unlikely, that our Galaxy will contain too many systems created by two objects with comparable mass, because such systems are unstable.

482121,comment,482039,482088,0,0,tsuraan,,,"I think you must be looking at the total memory for the apps (including shared libraries, etc), because I ran OSX with 512MB for five years without much trouble.  I typically had mail, opera, and tons of terminals open, and there was still typically around 40MB of free memory.  Upgrading my laptop to 2GB did allow me to run safari and webkit and iTunes (now that's a hog) at the same time, which was definitely nicer, but I never really felt crippled by only having 512MB before that.",1234720652

482119,comment,482036,482036,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"This article really annoyed me.<p>Yes experiences can produce happiness in people who crave experiences but what of people who don't?<p>For what my opinion is worth here is the story behind Money and Happiness:  Money does buy happiness but only if you really think through what your end goal is.  So the guy who buys a bunch of stuff with his money and isn't happy didn't realize he was buying the stuff to get respect and that the stuff wouldn't actually get him that result.  So he ends up not happy.  But that doesn't mean he would be happy if he'd traveled Europe instead.<p>Happiness is an individual pursuit.  I'll give you an example from my own life (if I might be so bold as to hold myself up as a template for happiness)<p>I think I've done pretty well for a guy in his 20s (I have a few hundred thousand dollars to my name).  That money makes me very happy.  But you know what I buy with it?  Nothing.  Zip.  Nada.  What I wanted out of life was the freedom to do what I want.  I love to program and I wanted to spend my time trying to help the world.  That money allows me to take a job where I make way less than I could elsewhere and still be confident that I won't starve and that I can retire someday if I want to.<p>Not an experience, not a possession but it makes me very happy because I focused on what I wanted from my money and found a way to get that out of it.  That, to me, is how money buys happiness.  There's not hard set rule like ""spend on experiences"" it's just a matter of honestly asking yourself what you really want and then logically finding a way to go after it.",1234720608

482115,comment,482039,482061,0,0,tsuraan,,,"Screen real estate isn't reasonably measured in inches; resolution makes a ton more sense.  My laptop's display is 1600x900, which is plenty of room for three terminals side-by-side.  The screen itself is only 13.3"" though.  On the other hand, I know plenty of people with 20"" displays that run them at really low resolutions, such as 1024x768 or 1280x1024.<p>Why couldn't you use Spaces on a laptop?  My old powerbook G4 ran spaces just fine; I used 6 of them; one for email, one for a browser, and the rest for terminals.  I never had a problem with it.",1234720356
482114,comment,482039,482074,0,0,Jebdm,,,"I noticed that as well.  I run Ubuntu, which could be part of it (although that's not to say Ubuntu's not a little bloated as well).  Just to test this, I opened up every program that I could think of which I use on a regular basis:<p><pre><code>  - Firefox, with 20 tabs\n  - Skype\n  - Pidgin\n  - Three terminal windows, running Python, vim, and CherryPy\n  - Songbird\n  - GIMP with a photo loaded\n  - Two OpenOffice Writer files\n  - Geany (a text editor) with nine tabs\n  - Nautilus\n  - Three large PDFs (books) using Evince Document Viewer\n  - System Monitor (not much)\n</code></pre>\nAnd I'm only at 1.2 GB!  (No swap, out of 2 GB total.)  I rarely have all of these programs open at once, either.<p>While I agree with his point in general, it might be overall more effective to avoid relying on apps as bloated as Visual Studio.  Then, you can save some of the money on computer upgrades and avoid any negatives that might be associated with developing on a high-end computer.

The logical progression would be that Christianity would simply follow the lead of Judaism, i.e., Christianity is just for men.<p>Of course, that's a big-picture, long-range guess.

They use the 'disgust' of hearing that humans could be related to modern day apes, and thus is not so special.<p>As you said, religion would have to adapt, but that is an impact.  I'm more curious what path they would take.  As you said, they could deny them full privileges of being sentient...that is they are less than human.

482090,comment,482053,482053,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"While we are on the subject of philosophy, I find on something of a philosophical note, the interesting ways and manners in which truth can unveil itself. Of course ""unveiling"" has a distinct meaning in Heidegger, but I am using this more generally, just to mean how the ""deep truths of life"" come to us/emerge/unveil from unexpected sources. I am reminded, then, in this case of a 'Charmed' episode where Prue Halliwell (Shannen Doherty) is trying to save somebody from the Angel of Death. She ultimately is confronted by the Angel of Death who tells her that he is not good or evil, but simply inevitable. She has to let go of her hatred of Death and see him as simply part of the natural course of things. Thus death from the point of view of hairless apes like us or the point of view of galaxies or even the whole universe, is in fact neither good nor bad, it simply is. Fearing it does not make it not so. Thus, one way or another it must be accepted, it must be seen as an inevitable part of the ""rerum naturum"". I really think on this subject the only way to sort of deal with our own annihilation or the fear thereof is to say that as long as we are fearing it, we have not encountered it. To fear, we must be alive. Therefore we have not an object of fear to fear. What is it to fear without an object? Anxiety. Undirected fear is anxiety. It is the antithesis of rationality. As human beings we must seek to be rational. We must seek to free ourselves from irrational fear. It is not rational to fear that which by definition we can never experience. We cannot by definition ""experience"" annihilation. We cannot experience annihilation, anymore than we really ""experience"" falling asleep. One moment we are drifting off in bed. The next moment the alarm clock goes off. Death is the same thing, except without the alarm clock. Either way, there is no ""experience"", and therefore no object of fear. Death is not bad. Death is not good. Death is inevitable, as Prue Halliwell came to see. I take comfort in knowing though that as death is inevitable so is birth. And perhaps even out of the ashes of the current universe new big bangs could spring forth, as some theories hint at. And so life (and death) goes on, ad infinitum.<p>We are, as Gregory Corso wrote in one of his poems, 'Homer', ""alive, as always, forever ignorant of that death you'll never know.""<p>Fearing the inevitable which cannot be even experienced is just not rational. The only thing to do is enjoy our moment in the sun. We all die, but spending our time fearing this just means we are not ever really alive, and that is just sad. Myself, I will leave eternity to the multiverse, and enjoy my brief tenure as a gene-carrying robot for all it is worth! :-)",1234718478

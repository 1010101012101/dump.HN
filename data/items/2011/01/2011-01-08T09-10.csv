To me, a suit learning how to code and calling himself a hacker feels like a white guy going to his first sweat lodge and changing his name to running wolf. Congrats, now you've got a lifetime of coding, and hacking (two separate but related things) ahead of you. Enjoy the journey.<p>*Edit: More to the point, since I know YCombinator loves the word hacker... what I want is for you to treat it like the honorific it is. A gentleman doesn't call himself a gentleman. One does not call themself a sensei. I don't call myself Mister Zyphlar. Hacker is not in my twitter bio.

This is a type of subpoena that does not require a probable cause or judicial oversight (meaning that the FBI can issue them without court order) and the recipient is under a gag order prohibited from speaking about them.<p>In addition, Google seems to also abide to subpoenas issued by other countries, but does not clearly state under what conditions. E.g., is the German government only able to subpoena accounts of German citizens? Or of people who used Gmail in Germany? Or of any Gmail user if there is a probable connection to Germany? And under what conditions does Google adhere to the data retention laws in some European countries?<p>I acknowledge that there are cases where it is legitimate that government agencies get access to one's mails. But if this is possible without court orders I consider this largely undemocratic. As a consequence, I try to keep as much information as possible on my own server (with a fully encrypted filesystem).<p>So I:<p>- Currently use Google for searches, but I have set my browser to delete all cookies on shutdown. I have not Flash installed, so I'm not affected by ""Flash-cookies"". I also tried out duckduckgo as search engine, but in my opinion the search results are considerably worse than Google's.<p>- I have some domains using Google Apps that I've moved to Google in the past. But I'm currently in the process to also move the remaining domains (that only relay mails) back to my own server. However, I also acknowledge that this is somewhat futile given that 90% of people I communicate with use Gmail - meaning that all of my mails are stored on Gmail anyway.",1294479887

IANAL, but I'm pretty sure that's the same as being patented.<p>Specifically, we have a ""plurality"" of objects in a doubly-linked list because it's a list and we have a primary and auxiliary pointer that lets the computer go through all the items without resorting them.  In a doubly-linked list, the primary pointer points forwards, the auxiliary pointer points backwards and it lets a computer program go through the list without sorting.<p>Notably, there's <i>no</i> limitation I can see on claim #1 that forbids the auxiliary pointers from all going backwards and the field of invention might as well just say ""computers.""

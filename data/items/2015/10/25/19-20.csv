In high-school, I was interested in physics more than math and whenever I took interest in math it was because it would help me understand some specific aspect of the physics better.

And this number doesn&#x27;t factor in private VC-funded R&D spend which would probably bring the figure closer to 90%, if not higher.<p>Also interesting to note how the VC industry became the powerhouse it is today:<p><i>In 1978, the attractiveness of venture capital received a shot in the arm that transformed the industry from having lived on life-support for seven years to a robust institution. The 1978 Revenue Act reduced the capital gains rate from 49 1/2% to 28%. The flow of monies into venture capital funds jumped from $68 million to nearly $1 billon. Then in 1979, Congress passed the ERISA “Prudent Man” Rule that allowed pension funds to invest in venture capital. Again, venture capital benefited. By 1983, new commitments exceeded $5 billion.</i> [1]<p>Also interesting to note that the largest source of funding for VC firms is now pension funds, meaning that poor VC performance could affect the money that states set aside for retirement. [2] But equally important is to note that the average pension fund allocates less than 1% to VC funding, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal if VCs were to fail in a vacuum.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.historyofcomputercommunications.info/Book/7/7.10-ReturnVentureCapital.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.historyofcomputercommunications.info/Book/7/7.10-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-09-23/are-public-pensions-inflating-a-venture-capital-bubble"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-09-23/are-public-p...</a>",1445803132

However, the market may <i>surface</i> demand that was previously inert.<p>My favorite example is &quot;collectable computers&quot; since I lived this during the late 90&#x27;s and early naughts. A lot of people wished they had that old computer they learned on, or wanted desperately as a kid, but circumstances had kept them from it, and they had largely resigned themselves to never owning one. And then Ebay happened. And it created a market that allowed sellers from everywhere to put what ever crap they wanted to &quot;online&quot; to a wide variety of possible buyers. And suddenly, people had a way to actually service their desire for an old computer.<p>Altairs, IMSAI&#x27;s, PDP 8&#x27;s and PDP 11&#x27;s. Stuff that was &quot;worthless crap&quot; could find someone who would cherish it and pay for it. I found myself buying pallets of stuff from SRI&#x27;s &quot;junk&quot; sale for $50, only to sell the 10 HP calculators in a box on that pallet for $2,500 on EBay, old PDP parts to collectors for $300 - $500, and just playing with a really nice set up custom built instruments.<p>So did Ebay &quot;fuel&quot; the demand? It certainly felt like it from a non-economist point of view. It was the only thing different now than before. But no, the demand was out there and Ebay simply made the market for it.<p>The Ivory market is the same way, its constrained to legal sources but the demand exceeds those sources. If there was <i>no</i> market for ivory the demand would remain boxed up, with people who wished they could having something of ivory but won&#x27;t cross the line of legality to get it. That demand would go dormant. And many times it has been proposed to do just that, ban all ivory sale and transport. And that would hurt the poachers, but it also would hurt the folks who have &quot;legal&quot; ivory and could benefit from converting it into cash.

Easy-to-configure failover is the obvious one.  Index-organized tables are another (it doesn&#x27;t have non-index-organized tables, though :P).  It also uses direct I/O instead of going through the OS, so it can be considerably faster for some types of queries in InnoDB (I&#x27;ve seen over 2x better performance for something like raw insert).  It also has a pluggable storage engine (though Postgres sorta does too, in the sense of multiple backends, most of its functionality is closely tied to the default one).  InnoDB&#x27;s MVCC implementation is different from Postgres&#x27;s so it probably has advantages in some situations (though I don&#x27;t know what those might be).  It uses a thread per connection, rather than a process, and doesn&#x27;t have to allocate the majority of the per-session memory up front, so it can support more connections than Postgres by default (aka without using some third-party tool like pgbouncer to create a connection pool).<p>There&#x27;s probably more stuff?  However, Postgres has a ton of other features that weren&#x27;t mentioned in the article... I think the general response from MySQL developers on this topic is that in practice companies don&#x27;t want all the features Postgres has.

It occurred to me, reading the article, that Northern Californians may be unusually ill prepared to handle the changes that occurred in the State.  People often say to me &quot;well, you grew up here, so you aren&#x27;t as shocked by the prices&quot;, but it actually may be the opposite.  Someone who grew up outside SF sees moving here as a choice, a decision to accept the outrageously high real estate prices as the cost of living here.  But the truth is, the high prices in SF are just as much of a shock to people who grew up here.  Of course, this is a slight of hand, as it actually is just as much of a choice to stay here as it is to move here, but it is more jarring to have to leave your hometown due to a fairly sudden stratospheric rise in housing prices than it is to decide not to move to a place you&#x27;ve never lived (especially if it involves leaving family or lifelong friends behind).<p>Another factor is that the very low prices may have instilled a lack of materialism in California kids that left them, as I said, unusually unprepared for what was to follow.  When a school teacher, humanities professor, or social worker can afford a 3 bedroom house in palo alto with a nice sized backyard  In that sort of environment, their children will often grow up believing that it wasn&#x27;t really worth chasing the money, that in fact, you <i>shouldn</i>, that this would be to waste a gift.  Yes, you&#x27;ll still need an income, but why would you sacrifice a life where you enjoy your work and do good, if all that requires is that you live in a modest house in middle class Palo Alto or Noe Valley than a mansion in Pacific Heights or Hillsborough?  What none of these people were prepared for is the reality that living in &quot;middle class&quot; Palo Alto (long, long gone) or Noe Valley will be complete off limits, and that a house in the Excelsior may even be just out of reach.<p>One thing that did make me cringe was the old, tired trope that doctors and lawyers are priced out, and that &quot;only techies need apply&quot;.  Rank and file &quot;techies&quot; were an integral part of the old SF that Dan Duane says he misses - hell, programming was even discussed as path to find the serene focus in &quot;Zen and the article of motorcycle maintenance.&quot;  Programmers and other techies were types who had renounced the big salaries of corporate law or banking to do something more creative and interesting.  This view of tech was alive and well in the late 90s, and shows up in a lot of PG&#x27;s early essays.<p>C&#x27;mon, Dan, the median salary for lawyers and doctors is waaay higher than for your typical &quot;techie&quot;.",1445802039

Visual studio wasn&#x27;t what it is today and there was sooo much worthless cruft to wade through. DirectX was the &quot;new hotness&quot; and it was a sad place compared to OpenGL. But I met a young man who was succeeding brilliantly, and I saw a bit of myself in him. And I realized the only difference in how we approached the problem was the &quot;wonder&quot; we saw in how amazing this stuff was.<p>I remembered the palpable shock of excitement I got when I checked the orbital mechanics of a program (game really) I wrote in BASIC to dock with satellites matched up with the actual results. Here I was in high school doing the same calculations as someone in NASA, and that was huge for me. That sense of wonder and excitement drove me to explore everything I could about computers and technology. And then after I had been working for about 15 years I didn&#x27;t have it any more.

(mind you, this happened when I was 14 years old!)<p>I joined a Kung Fu academy, to try to lose the misterious weight I started gaining, I got stronger, and heavier (ie: I built up muscle, but didn&#x27;t get rid of the extra water and fat).<p>I was alright, but I moved to another city due to college reasons, so I needed a new sport, doctors (and physical education teachers) recommended cardio, and high-reps exercise.<p>Also I went to dieticians, that recommended whole grains and whatnot.<p>My weight kept rising, and I started to weaken, at the gym after some months I could lift less weight than when I started.<p>Then I learned how the body process nutrients, for example eating cholesterol don&#x27;t make it rise, the body disassemble it and stores the components, later if the body needs cholesterol it assembles it back, primarily out of carbohydrates.<p>So I theorized: if I dump carbohydrates, maybe things will get better.<p>I then asked the professional opinions, they all told me I was wrong, mad, whatever, and that I would fuck-up my heart, and that cabohidrates were necessary.<p>I still went ahead and started to eat at lunch only foliage vegetables (lettuce for example), carrots (because I like them a lot) and some source of protein (cheese, meat, sausage, whatever).<p>And at dinner I ate only a can of tuna.<p>My cholesterol suddenly dropped to high, but non-critical levels (it went from 280 to 195, with 200 being the &quot;critical&quot; level threshold, and I think 120 is the &quot;safe&quot; threshold), my triglycerides finally came back to what it was when I was 14, and my weight dropped from 130kg to 90kg (still too much though, I was supposed to weight 70kg).<p>Also I started to design my own exercise programs, and do heavy-lifting with free weights and low reps, and skip cardio completely for the most part (I was already reasonably active enough, I don&#x27;t own a car, so anywhere I needed to go I walked).<p>For the first time gym felt like something that wasn&#x27;t pointless, I finally started to get heavier weights over time, feel better, and get strong enough to do some day-to-day things better (Example: before this I could not grip safely in my hand a 2 liter coca-cola bottle safely if it was full, I would drop it, thus to pour drinks I used to put the bottle on the edge of the table, hold the top with one hand, the cup with another, and slowly tilt it, now I can just do like a normal person, and get the bottle with one hand in the middle and pour normally).<p>I am still too weak, and too overweight though, I finally started taking thyroid meds, and they helped a little, but not much, I am struggling to find a decent medic...<p>At least, I am not that old (I am 27), so I still have time to fix up my life, but is still a fucked up situation.",1445799640

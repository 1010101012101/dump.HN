Estimote Beacons with their adhesive layer were designed to be sticked to walls vertically. Thanks to their position and antenna orientation we are able to &quot;estimate&quot; position of the user inside the building. Indoor location is also power-consuming for beacons while they broadcast a bit more often, so we can do better math while analyzing data.\nStickers were designed for movable objects with much shorter range and a bit longer advertising intervals.",1411592378

If it&#x27;s unclear to other programmers, I think that&#x27;s only because gotos have fallen so far out of fashion that they look alien now. That&#x27;s really a shame, because there are cases for the elegant use of goto, and I think the retry() code above is one of them.<p>You argued earlier that there was no point in making this optimization in the first place, since it probably wasn&#x27;t contributing a significant delay in the application (which I disagree with on the grounds that we don&#x27;t know what retry() might be used for), but now you&#x27;re saying that it shouldn&#x27;t be done this way because the compiler might later do a better job of optimizing a standard loop.<p>As others have pointed out, there are some good reasons not to expect PHP&#x27;s bytecode runtime to match the optimizations of other software compilers. Without knowing in advance exactly how many times the function call embedded in retry() will be repeated -- which seems pretty unlikely -- there&#x27;s no good way for the compiler to unroll the loop more efficiently than has already been done here with the straightforward application of a goto.<p>Sure, in general, don&#x27;t be too clever. (Rather, &quot;don&#x27;t be cruel to future programmers&quot;.) I agree. But, I think there&#x27;s a far greater danger of programmers blindly following guidelines like &quot;don&#x27;t use goto&quot; without consideration.<p>So while there probably isn&#x27;t a good argument <i>for</i> writing this function this way, there also isn&#x27;t a good argument <i>against</i> it -- which is what makes all of the discussion around it so funny.",1411592006

8364058,comment,8363043,8363043,3,0,Someone1234,,,"As someone who moved from the UK to US under almost identical conditions, let me say this: If you have a job that offers health insurance 99% of the time you will be better off taking that health insurance rather than buying it directly from the exchanges.<p>Why? At least two reasons:<p>1. Employers are in a stronger negotiating position as insurance companies really fight for the business (it is for multiple people, so even if each one is less profitable the entire account will be more profitable with less overhead, so they WANT it).<p>2. The people buying directly from exchanges are higher risk/greater cost. They&#x27;re normally poorer, self employed (which includes a lot of people in physically demanding professions as well, who get injured often), and some are early retirees (pre-medicare age, but still &quot;older&quot;).<p>Plus the biggest reason is that almost all employers pay a % of your health insurance premium. If you go with the exchange you&#x27;re paying 100% (of a higher base) rather than 70% of a lower one. So unless your employer has simply terrible health insurance, it is almost never a better idea from a financial perspective to go private.<p>If you&#x27;re really paranoid about it, just take the employer health insurance, assuming they pay 30% and you pay 70% of the premium, take an equivalent amount out of your pay and save it (e.g. save 30% of the premium a month). Since that is what you would have been paying privately anyway (100%), now you&#x27;re just using the employer&#x27;s cut to save for a rainy day.<p>Personally if it was up to me employer provided health insurance should be banned in the US and everyone (aside from the US Military) should be required to go out and get private coverage (e.g. car insurance). That way the prices come down, competition goes up, and certain demographics (unemployed, self-employed, early retirees, etc) aren&#x27;t unfairly &quot;punished.&quot;<p>But I don&#x27;t see that happening any time soon (or ever) because employer provided health insurance is too heavily ingrained in US culture. Nobody even discussed destroying that link during the ObamaCare debates. So whatever...<p>For now, until things change, employer is the way to go.",1411591869

You don&#x27;t just say &quot;hey, screw Aqua I want to use something else.&quot; (You can run other WMs through X11, but only on top of Aqua) Darwin is a bit more BSD-like, but nobody actually uses Darwin without the rest of MacOS.<p>And seriously, systemd isn&#x27;t one single daemon either. It&#x27;s a collection of daemons running that communicate over a common protocol. It isn&#x27;t all-or-nothing, either. Only a few of the daemons are considered &quot;core&quot; and the rest are optional. And,  because they use a common documented  protocol, even the core components can be replaced. You don&#x27;t hear about alternatives because nobody has really written any, but it doesn&#x27;t in any way prevent you from doing it.<p>I think the legitimate concerns about systemd are things like losing portability of stuff like Gnome to BSD and systemd&#x27;s short history, but it isn&#x27;t one giant monolith executable or anything like people say.",1411591730

Even with OrderAhead and DoorDash, nearby restaurants get played out fast.<p>I first tried Gobble when I saw a trial card over at Zombie Runner on California Ave. Back then, Gobble delivered fully cooked dinners at 7pm on weekday nights. I used Gobble about 3 nights a week for a few months. Dinner went from something I had to figure out, to the highlight of my evening. We&#x27;d get to eat something new and delicious a few times a week without playing out local restaurants or the handful of dishes that we&#x27;d normally cook. Gobble actually improved my relationship with my girlfriend.<p>At the time, my primary complaint was that I had to reheat the food and eat out of a takeout container.<p>About a month ago, Gobble switched to delivering these meal kits. Having just met Ooshma in person, I (naturally) gave her a really hard time about this. Cooking takes too long and I have other things to do.<p>There were fewer choices than before, I needed to wash a pan (sometimes two, if pasta was involved), and I needed to actually get off my computer to help make dinner happen.<p>That was 15 meals ago.<p>I still think about the first Gobble dinner kit I made in back August. I actually woke up the next morning thinking about how good perfectly the fresh mozzarella balanced the spicy kick of the chili flakes.<p>Dinner-Kits Gobble is the best Gobble yet. Now I actually eat dinner like a real person. Sometimes dinner takes a little longer than 10 minutes to prepare, end to end, and sometimes it needs more than one pan, but it ends up tasting so good that I feel stupid complaining about either of those things.<p>Out of 15 meals, about 8 of them have been wish-there-were-more-leftovers-amazing about 5 of them were good enough order again, and a couple were just ok. All of them were worth way more than the $12 and ~10 minutes of effort.<p>I have never had a problem with Gobble that a message to Ooshma didn&#x27;t fix.<p>Yesterday I got an email from Gobble with 3 invites for 100% free boxes. I&#x27;ve got two left. I think you still need to sign up to use it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you can cancel immediately.

8363984,comment,8356489,8356489,1,0,tripzilch,,,"(1. why?) Well it does save cash :) I only consider it recreation when I have friends over. The main reason, however, because it&#x27;s <i>normal</i>. Probably a cultural thing (not judging!). In the Netherlands (or at least in my circles), it&#x27;d be considered &quot;weird&quot; if you eat out (or takeout) more than once or twice a week. It&#x27;s just considered normal that people cook, like doing laundry. Also means it&#x27;s not going to be fancy always, sometimes it&#x27;s just fuel and nutrients (some/any combo of vegetables, proteins and carbs). I also believe it&#x27;s more expensive to eat out than in the US, relative to cooking from basic ingredients (or maybe vegetables are cheaper, I dunno). I can make tasty dinner for about €5-7 (two portions). Getting something <i>healthy</i> readymade for you is at least €10 (one portion).<p>(2. planning) Remember that article a while back about &quot;people sized cities&quot; (or something like that)? In NL, if you live in a medium-size town, a supermarket is never farther away than a 5 minute bicycle ride. My closest one is less than 200m, the next (bigger) one is 700m. But I&#x27;m lucky :) There are people that do weekly shopping of course, usually either big families or people that live out in the country, where the nearest supermarket is a cardrive away (like in the US).\nBesides shopping-planning, if I cook for myself, I usually make at least two-three portions because it&#x27;s really the same amount of work as making one. Also you can&#x27;t buy many kinds of fresh ingredients in single-meal amounts. So I do need to plan ahead to be able to eat all that stuff before it goes bad. Sometimes that means having weird dinner-type things for breakfast. I hate throwing food away, but I try not to be too hard on myself if it means I ate healthy stuff, but messed up on the planning.<p>(3. what do I cook) Everything. My staple go-to meals, however are some kind of pasta-vegetable-salad (fusili pasta, cherry tomatoes, any kind of salad vegetables, cucumber, paprika, shallots, etc, any cheese, salami, bacon, eggs, olives etc whatever I have in the fridge + dressing from mayo+mustard+honey) and broccoli + fried tempeh or organic sausages. Also, brussel sprouts. These last two vegetables seem (for me) to cover most nutrients I&#x27;ve been missing when I feel I haven&#x27;t been eating healthy. At least I feel better immediately :)<p>I also love cooking weird and/or special stuff. I could write a whole series of posts on that. And I did, but the stories/pictures are spread over many different parts and ages of the Internet.<p>(4. diet) Not really. I did paleo/keto for a while, twice, it was fun, tasty and really interesting to find your body can go into a different &quot;mode&quot; (ketosis) for energy. However I found that my physical condition for running improved a great deal when I added more carbs to my diet. I probably did something wrong, cause many people seem to be able to do sports just fine on keto diets. Anyway, these days I just don&#x27;t eat a lot of carbs. I find I have to pay attention to eating <i>enough</i> (sorry I&#x27;m probably weird), both calorie-wise and nutrients (as I said, broccoli/sprouts).<p>(5. hacks and tips) I have zillions. Get a good knife. Learn how to use your microwave effectively (it cooks broccoli and many other things to perfection, if you know how--I&#x27;ll explain if asked). Dishwashing machine. Check out the kitchen-tools section in shops every now and then, see if there&#x27;s any tools that may make your particular way of cooking easier. If you don&#x27;t have bbq tongs, get them, even if you&#x27;re vegetarian. Fresh ginger keeps for a long time in the freezer. Get to know the chemistry behind cooking, preparing food, nutrition, etc. Watch Alton Brown&#x27;s series <i>Good Eats</i>, it&#x27;ll not only teach you loads of basic cooking techniques, but also the how & why behind these techniques, and even the chemistry/science of it. Plus it&#x27;s entertaining. Just pick some random episodes on topics you think are interesting. I guarantee you&#x27;ll learn something useful from every one of them.

There is a strict upper limit on neutron stars of about 1.4 solar masses. Beyond this, gravity is stronger than the repulsive core of the strong nuclear force, and the star should collapse. If the process described in this paper is what actually occurs, the star will shed mass due to Hawking radiation while collapsing. The end-state of that process must be either a neutron star (which can&#x27;t have more than 1.4 solar masses) or something else.

We no longer do things this way.<p>Publishing a page is running content from a CMS through a templating system. However, the time spent executing templates isn&#x27;t the only factor in the duration of the &quot;publish&quot;. The slides refer to a compilation step (which actually also included a preprocessor step), and includes delegating to a service to copy the resulting page to disk and ensure the write succeeds for all data centers. For data consistency and system monitoring, we essentially treat that entire process as an atomic action and wait for all parts to finish. Additionally, since &quot;publishing&quot; is a core process for us, we avoid doing massive publishes that might risk the systems involved in the successful publishing of current articles. So increasing the number of these for the sake of pushing code is considered too risky.

If you want to make a narrative feature it&#x27;s a great deal trickier. That&#x27;s why the most successful Kickstarter projects in this area have been tied to existing franchises, eg the <i>Veronica Mars</i> film.<p>But suppose you have an original concept that&#x27;s not a film version of a graphic novel and doesn&#x27;t have a built-in fanbase: that&#x27;s an awful lot harder to get interest for, and the methods you can use to get interest (eg sharing the script or key art or storyboards) can also limit your upside, ie the more you reveal to potential backers the less suspense you can create in the work itself.<p>It&#x27;s doable and crowdfunding is definitely going to become an increasingly important business model, but it&#x27;s still very far from an ideal approach. When I look at narrative projects on Kickstarter I can tell a lot just from the tagline, picture, and budget they&#x27;re seeking. And for 90% of people trying to do a feature the prognosis is negative - either the quality is going to be dreadful, or the producers clearly don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, or everyone in front of and behind the camera is going to be working for free (with a correspondingly higher risk of non-completion). Unfortunately, the most competent ones (in terms of demonstrable ability to deliver a marketable film) are <i>less</i> likely to get funded, because of the amount of money they need to raise.",1411589516

You feel that the creator owns all potential value immediately when the thing is created.\nI dont believe that this is true, the owner owns only that value which they are able to realize, if they are unable to realize the value they expected then that is not theft.<p>It is however copyright infringement to make and distribute copies.  I am not trying to defend piracy as a whole, i am simply saying a person downloading a piece of media is not committing theft; they are only taking part in copyright infringement, you are trying to make the argument that it is the same thing as theft.<p>>It&#x27;s not an assumption that there is demand for the product if people are willing to download it.<p>Correct.<p>>And, economics (as well as common sense) tells us that there is some price above zero that people are willing to pay for that which they demand. Isn&#x27;t that all we really need to know?<p>where did this come from? demand of an infinitely reproducible product does not necessitate &quot;some price above zero&quot; it can be exactly zero dollars that people are willing to pay.\nThere are any number of things at any given moment that I would like to have but would not pay for, if i were able to get those things for free, i would.<p>People will take free things they dont even want simply because they are free (free tshirts at sporting events), does that mean each of those tshirts represents a lost sale because all of those people clearly demanded a t shirt and would pay &quot;some price above zero&quot; for it?<p>> So, now, at what point along the continuum of one pirated copy to all pirated copies has the producer experienced an actual theft, and how is it the consumer&#x27;s choice to make that determination?<p>Theft is never experienced, that is my point.  There is a crime committed when the content is unlawfully distributed, that is copyright infringement.<p>>No thanks.

What&#x27;s so difficult to understand about compensating the producer of something you wish to consume?<p>Again you totally missed the point.  By your logic, which is that the producer of a good should be compensated for every procurement of the good by an end customer.<p>By selling something used, lets say an iPhone, you are stealing (by your definition) from Apple.  Not only are you stealing from them but you are directly profiting from that theft.  You have removed Apple from the sale of the good that they produced, denying them a potential sale.<p>Even if you GAVE your old iPhone to a friend, by your definition, this is theft since Apple was denied a potential sale.<p>I think it is clear that neither of those things is actually theft, nothing was stolen.",1411589049

A well-cooked chicken is a delight, but it&#x27;s a pretty narrow range. I found beef and fish to be much less scary meats as a novice since undercooking them is less of a risk.

We are just barely off all time highs in the S&P and Dow. Nasdaq is also killing it -- even after some pullback in high beta (volatility) stocks.<p>Your returns the last 2 years are <i>not</i> typical of an average year. A return approaching double digits over a long trendline is not beyond reach, but it would be a mistake to bank on a 12% return IMHO, and even more of one to suggest other people could expect the same.<p>There are tons of calculators where you can play with average returns over time, check one out.",1411588872

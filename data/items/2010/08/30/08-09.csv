1645707,comment,1645125,1645125,0,0,lsc,,,"eh, honestly, I think the publisher-hate is as much from non-authors than authors.<p>Now, of course, if you are an author, and you don't need what a publisher provides, by all means, go at it without a publisher.   Modern technology now means that many of the things that were the exclusive domain of the publishers are now available to even us little guys.<p>But, speaking as an author, I /do/ need what the publisher provides, therefore I went with a publisher rather than going it alone.  And this is common and valid as well.<p>Now, in my field, Technical books, very few authors expect to more than pay for the pizza consumed while writing.  Anyone remotely qualified to write a technical book can likely make a lot more money in less time consulting.<p>You write a technical book to educate people, and to give yourself credibility.  Really, trading away the bulk of the money in exchange for that credibility would be a good deal by itself;  the fact that the publisher also takes care of all the minutia of actually manufacturing the books and getting them out to the stores is just gravy.    Hell, in my case, the publisher talked me in to writing the book in the first place, and rode me until I actually finished it; something I almost certainly would not have done on my own.<p>I mean, to give you some idea, ""The book of Xen""  took me and a guy who is better than I am three years to write.  We've sold something like two thousand copies.  Even if we kept $30 a pop (about what amazon sells the thing for)  that's only $60,000;  maybe half a year's pay for one of the two people doing it (counting benefits, etc...)  Now, we wern't working three years full time, but it was more than 6 months full time, and this ate some of our best and most productive hours.<p>Now, of course, in reality, my friend and I split 15 percent of the wholesale price, which is something like half the cover price, so we earned considerably less than we would have if we could have moved that many books on our own and paid zero for printing.<p>Yeah, if you are Knuth, you move a lot more books than I can.  But, if you are Knuth, you can also make a lot more money doing other things.  Would you give Knuth a cut of equity to sit on your board?  I would.<p>So yeah;  money (at least money directly from book sales)  is not the reason why anyone writes a technical book, so it doesn't really matter that the publisher takes a cut.<p>The number one thing a publisher brings is:<p>Credibility.<p>Next time you are at a cocktail party, mention you are working on a book.  I guarantee, the first thing someone sizing you up will ask is ""do you have a publisher?""<p>I mean, there are many other useful things my publisher did for me, but the credibility is at the top of the list.  Even assuming near superhuman levels of perseverance, enough to hire and supervise a good editor, etc... I still couldn't gain that credibility by myself.<p>Figure out how to replace the credibility function of publishers, and you will have a reason for technical authors to publish indie.",1283158009

Youtube was synonymous with online 'canned' video, google with 'search'.<p>By parking it under the google brand they may have made a mistake. Another - possibly small - effect of that is that you have two steps before getting to a site, video.google.com, is less convenient than youtube.com, and much less easy to promote as a brand separate from the search portion of the site. Many people read 'video.google.com' the same way they promoted 'images.google.com', as a search engine for online videos (which it now has become, for the most part) instead of an easy way to share your videos with your buddies and the rest of the world.<p>I don't think it will be possible to quantify this effect, but I notice that microsoft named their search engine 'bing.com' after several tries of doing it as a subsidiary, and that google has not attempted to bring youtube.com under the google domain as the replacement for video.google.com (which still exists), it is now the 'search' arm of google for video, returning youtube.com mixed with other video results, just like what you'd expect.",1283157631

1645696,comment,1645520,1645520,0,0,jhuckestein,,,"Thanks for your feedback guys. This was our first shot. Next we need to figure out<p>- What kind of problems lend themselves well to our framework? Most MapReduce algorithms crunch huge loads of data. Our framework is more useful for long-running computations on freely available data<p>- How does the technical side look? I'm thinking node as stateless master servers, hypertable for storage, and RabbitMQ for flexible persistent job queues. The client runner has some bigger problems, like circumventing the same-origin policy (for pulling data e.g. from graph.facebook.com or twitter) and streaming in large data.<p>- What to do about confidentiality. All computations will by virtue of the framework be visible to the workers. That may not be ideal in some cases.<p>- How to handle worker failure and incorrect results. In our system, workers are unreliable, not trustworthy and slow. That is very different from other implementations ;)<p>That said, if anyone here runs a lot of MapReduce tasks or is generally interested in the subject, drop us a line at team@maprejuice.com or leave us your email address at <a href=""http://maprejuice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maprejuice.com</a>.

(And for all the same reasons.)<p>So, I predicted this response. In fact, I even said,<p>> <i>There is a counter-argument that this also leads to better living conditions for the poor, and it's true, but that doesn't resolve the much greater economic divide between the various socio-economic classes.</i><p>I've been waiting almost all day for someone to come along and say, ""but the poor are so much better off!"" So, I apologize in advance ...<p>What do you think of slavery? I have a somewhat unconventional view of it. I think it was a necessary component of human progress for a long time, until technology could gradually supplant it. I don't think it was inherently evil (except of course in abusive conditions, which it usually was).<p>What was truly awful about slavery was that there was usually no way for a slave to have any chance at all of improving their class. There were exceptions, sure, but as a rule, once a slave, always a slave. <i>That</i> is where slavery is really bad, IMO.<p>Similarly, as the class divide becomes progressively wider in modern society, there are more and more people who will find it impossible to markedly improve their socio-economic status. As a rule of thumb, if you're homeless in the U.S. today, you're not likely to be sending your kids to college 20 years from now.<p>Part of the reason that I'm so passionate about the problem of poverty is because I've lived a small bit of it. I've made the transition from being quite poor to being -- at the moment -- less poor, and with a chance of being in pretty good shape in a few years. It takes a long time, and it takes vast amounts of energy. And, I had good luck on my side: I got to play with computers when I was very young, so I have useful skills.<p>While I gratefully concede that a poor person today has much better chances of being able to eat cooked food and enjoy the basic comforts of cheap entertainment and toys, I do <i>not</i> agree that having really really poor people and really really rich people is an indicator of a healthy society. Rockefeller, Carnegie, Gates, and others have chosen to do good things with their amassed fortunes, but I'd still rather see larger numbers of people attending secondary schools and learning trades -- things which are much harder to do when they're extremely poor.",1283156009

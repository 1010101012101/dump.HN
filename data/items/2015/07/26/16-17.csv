9951528,comment,9951143,9951401,0,0,xamuel,,,"But the OP title is misleading, this isn&#x27;t function overloading at all.  It&#x27;s macro overloading.  Subtle but important difference.  For example, you can&#x27;t pass the OP&#x27;s &quot;add&quot; around as a function pointer.  You can&#x27;t declare its prototype in an outside file (leaving the linker to link it in) without putting its full definition in said outside file.  Etc.<p>It also gives, IMO, better error messages than C++.  If we take OP&#x27;s code and change a and b from int to long, we get:<p><pre><code>    test.c:20:24: error: controlling expression type &#x27;long&#x27; not compatible with any generic association type\n    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, add(a, b)); // 3\n                       ^\n    test.c:16:28: note: expanded from macro &#x27;add&#x27;\n    #define add(a, b) _Generic(a, int: addi, char*: adds)(a, b)\n</code></pre>\nThis is better than the situation in C++ where it would say the function does not exist, and then go through every function with that name (possibly quite a lot) and say why each one doesn&#x27;t work.",1437929728
9951527,comment,9951283,9951417,0,0,mtviewdave,,,"The city of San Francisco did not give Lopez-Sanchez (the alleged murderer) sanctuary in the same way as described in the article.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement was free to detain Lopez-Sanchez at any time while he was in San Francisco, and then deport him.<p>What San Francisco did was refuse to comply with the ICE request to detain Lopez-Sanchez, because he didn&#x27;t have a violent record and because ICE did not get an arrest warrant. In situations like this, ICE apparently does not want to go through the process of getting a warrant, preferring instead to treat local law enforcement as an extension of federal immigration enforcement.<p>But in the U.S.&#x27;s federal system, it is not the responsibility of local law enforcement to simply do whatever the feds them to do. The responsibility of SFPD is to the people of San Francisco, not to ICE. Obviously in this case the result was horrific, but up to this point the policy was in place because the City believed it better served the needs of the people of San Francisco, and the people apparently agreed.<p>There&#x27;s obviously a good case to be made for local police departments to comply with ICE requests. On the other hand, I find it disturbing that ICE could simply order my local police department to detain me (a US citizen) without getting a warrant, just on their say-so. As someone with a strong respect for the U.S. federal system, I found your comparison to medieval sanctuary to be cheap and inflammatory.  Hence my earlier comment.",1437929725

Yes, 20 years ago you could build from balsa a sweet RC airplane that had tremendous range (and try to strap some home made explosives to it for nefarious purposes).  You could build an RC helicopter but you were going to have a hell of a time learning to fly it (and probably wreck your first few helis before you get the hang of it).<p>That required serious patience and skill on the model building front.  It required decent understanding of the radio, setting up the servos and trimming for flight, and to be honest the damn things (planes) are hard to fly at first.  (RC helicopters border on impossible!)  You also needed to find a field with room to practice take off and landing, etc.<p>Today I can buy a pre-built quad-copter that can fly for 15-20 minutes with no assembly required.  It&#x27;s stabilized and ridiculously easy to start flying.  I can practice for hours in private (in my living room, or back yard).  That same quad copter can be given an autonomous course to follow, becoming a &quot;fire and forget&quot; delivery vehicle which can be discretely launched far enough away from a target to be completely unobserved.<p>What if I load it up with as much anthrax as it can carry and set up a timed trigger to open the bag as it flies over a crowded festival, protest or some other gathering?  How many victims would result from the downwash at 30&#x27; above ground level?<p>I don&#x27;t think this can be solved with legislation to be honest (you won&#x27;t ever be able to stop a bad actor from getting the equipment, and bad actors will not register their gear).  I also don&#x27;t think this is a nightmare scenario - but I do think it&#x27;s a legitimate concern we should be talking about.",1437929614

Not mentioned in the post, but I would bet that in Microsoft-land, the release cycle is about two years so it gives a natural transition point.\nLet&#x27;s say that an engineer takes 4-6 months to ramp-up on a new team, that still gives 18 months of full productivity. I&#x27;m sure that engineers reach 80% of the learning curve was traversed at 12 months.<p>The fact that it takes them 3-4 days to decide the next round of teams seems very long, in spite the post&#x27;s insistence that it&#x27;s short.<p>I&#x27;m interested in environments where teams chose a much shorter cycles. I think shorter cycles would present a different set of challenges, like reducing ramp-up times and cycle decision times. It may also be easier, like reducing the risk of a single cycle decision.<p>I have heard reports from a company with ~50 engineers who had 2 week cycle times, which was basically their sprint time though releases would have much more frequently. They had the advantage of a mostly homogeneous language and development environment. There kept in up for more than two years, at which point the company pivoted, no longer had a homogeneous dev environment and were doing more greenfield and less support/optimization/incremental-improvement. All reports were great. People were always surprised how the team would even out the teams when put in a single room, where the teams and choices were clear to everyone.",1437929543

9951506,comment,9947816,9947816,0,0,atroyn,,,"Your story sounds a lot like mine, I&#x27;m just a little further down the road.<p>I graduated with a Bachelor&#x27;s in Computer Engineering (i.e. as a hardware guy) five years ago.<p>I spent my very early career trying stuff out. I did an internship as a software engineer, then  I started out as a graduate consultant doing no engineering at all, then I started my own company where I helped hack together the prototype, and most recently I&#x27;ve been working as a data engineer and web developer.<p>I learned a lot about the industry from many different point of view, but more importantly I learned a lot about myself. I figured out software in general and the web in particular isn&#x27;t for me - I need to get my hands dirty and I need to build physical products to feel satisfied.<p>So I&#x27;m going back to get my master&#x27;s from a hardware-focused CS program with a major research and interdisciplinary component where I can really get back to my undergrad &#x27;roots&#x27; with VHDL, SPICE and soldering iron, as well as learning a bunch of new stuff about embedded systems, robotics and machine vision. I haven&#x27;t been this excited about technology in a long time.<p>The upshot of all of this is that you don&#x27;t have to have it all figured out right now, and taking the time to really learn about something that interests you is extremely valuable. So is having depth in two very valuable technical skillsets. Time spent learning is never &#x27;wasted&#x27; and if you decide to come back to EE/ECE or go deep on embedded systems, you totally can - and you&#x27;ll probably kick ass at it because you&#x27;ll have experience and maturity others might not have.<p>Finally, from a market point of view, there&#x27;s a weird convergence going on, of which the proliferation of embedded systems is just the vanguard. Batteries are getting cheaper lighter and smaller, SDR is becoming more and more common, automation is becoming increasingly necessary, and machine-machine communication is going to need whole new infrastructures. It&#x27;s a good time to know what&#x27;s going on at the low level while knowing what software could/should do.",1437929286

One library I really wanted to try was using Browserify but I wanted to use brunch/bower because my workflow was already in brunch. Even with the brunch-browserify plugin this wasn&#x27;t possible. After wasting two days on it, I gave up and just used Browserify by itself. Another couple of hours it was actually working. This is typical. On another app, I use gulp. Another piece of garbage that claims that when you run a command &#x27;gulp watch&#x27; it will automatically rebuild your assets. It won&#x27;t.<p>These are only three small projects, each using a different build tool: browserify, gulp, and brunch + bower. None of them are compatible with each other and it&#x27;s unlikely they will ever work together in one project without hours or days of trial and error. If there was one monolithic (or not) dependency / build tool that actually worked, I&#x27;d much rather use that, <i></i>and it would be a much better approach than having a whole bunch of small crappy tools that don&#x27;t work together.<i></i><p>tl;dr: Not only is having multiple tools doing the same thing in this area not appealing, it just leads to developers wasting massive amounts of time and &quot;what the fucks?&quot; working with half a dozen tools that do the same thing and do it poorly.",1437927082

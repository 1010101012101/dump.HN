5540635,comment,5537894,5540363,3,0,tptacek,,,"Sure. What's the alternative? What did you think happened when law enforcement investigated serious computer crimes? If a financial institution has a key database popped and the Secret Service is called in to investigate, was it your expectation that the victim was required to carefully anonymize and blind all the data in that database? How could any criminal investigation work if that was the requirement? (Cliff's Notes: That's not the requirement).<p>The bill as written, even before the narrowing amendments, acknowledges the risk this subthread discusses. It does that by trying to define ""cyber threat information"", as information directly implicated in an attack. In the sponsor's notes on the bill on the House site, they explain that the definition of ""protected entity"" was changed specifically to prevent individual people from being considered as entities, so that person-specific data couldn't be handed over under CISPA authority.<p>The basic problem the bill addresses is this: large companies are under continuous attack. Let's stipulate that attacks come in two flavors: DDOS and targeted malware.<p>In both cases, there is clear utility in allowing companies to collaborate with other companies and with the government.<p>In the DDOS case, you want to share NetFlow information with your upstream ISPs and with DDOS trackers, because those are the organizations that generate black-hole and IP filtering rules, and they all work better if they have lots of different vantage points to work from. At the very least, you want to push sources back up to your immediate upstream providers so they can soak them up on their infrastructure rather than saturating your uplinks.<p>In the malware case, you want to share forensic information that would help identify (a) the vulnerability the malware exploits, (b) the C&C system the malware is using, (c) any evidence of the source of the malware, and (d) forensic information that would help investigators discern the intent of the malware.<p>In both cases, your company's general counsel is apt to inform you that the legal risk of sharing just that information is potentially unbounded, because nobody can predict exactly what claims could be made under ECPA, SCA, DPPA, HIPAA, FERPA, &c; nobody even knows what traces of information, overt or statistical, might be lurking in NetFlow.<p>So the situation we have today is that there is information sharing when attacks happen, but much of it is <i>sub rosa</i>, and you have to be in the right clubs to get access to the right sharing networks.<p>It does not make intuitive sense to me that electronic privacy should mean that basic low-level systems information incident to a real attack should incur unbounded legal risk when shared with other companies directly involved in mitigating those attacks.<p>You might disagree, and that's fine. But the notion that CISPA is actually intended to allow NSA to read your email is just not supported by the language of the bill, by any advocacy for the bill, or by any of the bill's amendments, and the problem the bill is addressing is a real problem (I have some limited professional exposure to it).",1365796326

5540626,comment,5537414,5538155,2,0,drostie,,,"Thanks for this question! The answer is complicated. :D<p>Let me tell you first why it does <i>not</i> help! In order to build a rainbow table, we must be able to build a lookup table (since they're just compressed lookup tables). But a lookup table is basically a brute force attack on a certain category of passwords! So, if your password would fall to a modern rainbow table, it can be brute-forced by modern computational clusters. Salting does not change that. <i>Intrinsically</i> the password is no more secure than it was before. (To make it more secure, use bcrypt, scrypt, or pbkdf2. Seriously, even PHP has pbkdf2 nowadays, you have no excuse[1].)<p>Now let me mitigate that naysaying a bit. If you salt every password with a random 12-character base64 string, you do indeed prevent building a lookup table for the database. And that's actually not bad. Security is best measured not in bits or in operations, but in <i>dollars</i>. If the value of the information is much smaller than the cost to crack it, you'll defeat a rational attacker.<p>Rainbow tables can be built in a highly parallel way, with attackers pooling their resources and attacking multiple systems. So it will generally <i>cost</i> more to brute-force a password than it will to break it with a rainbow table: the rainbow table lookup can be done with one CPU; but brute forcing may require a botnet or lots of GPUs.<p>[1] Okay, there is one excuse: you might want to be able to do password administration from phpMyAdmin using <i>only</i> built-in MySQL functions. If you are stuck in this particular case the REPEAT() and SHA1 commands can have a similar effect:<p><pre><code>    create function pw(salt char(12), password varchar(255)) returns char(40) \n        return sha1(repeat(concat(salt, sha1(password)), 100000));\n</code></pre>\nbut if you're not in this case, use something better.",1365796238

I blame the people speculating on it like crazy without any idea what the fundamental value actually is (and to be fair it's impossible to know until it stabilizes and the bitcoin economy becomes established.)<p>But this is only temporary, a necessary evil when a currency is starting out.<p>However it is arguably a good thing though, because all the attention and people buying it hoping it will increase in value, is exposing a lot of people to it that otherwise wouldn't have been. It's helping it grow much faster.<p>>To replace our entire dollar base money with Bitcoins would require that each Bitcoin be valued at more than $370,000.<p>I'm confused by what he means by this. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Even if there was only one bitcoin in the economy it could still be used perfectly fine as a currency.<p>>In contrast, a good monetary control system would fix the value of the currency unit (in terms of gold or something else real) and then adjust the size of the monetary base on a moment-by-moment basis in order to maintain this value in the markets.<p>This doesn't really make too much sense either. It takes a long time for arbitrary changes in the currency supply to have any effect. And all they can do is print more money, which makes everyone else's money worth less and therefore makes them worse off.<p>One interesting thing I've been thinking about is that since it's digital currency inflation and deflation can be corrected for a little. People could have their sites change prices based on the current inflation or deflation rate (if they really care about it so much.) This was harder to do with real world price tags. It's not a solution of course but it might help a lot. Usually the criticism of changes in a currencies value is that prices don't adjust fast enough to deal with it. But with the internet information is transmitted and changes can be made instantly.<p>>No modern economy could survive the constant, grinding deflation that having a fixed monetary base would eventually produce.<p>So this is more controversial, but I don't see why not. A currency that actually increases in value rather than decreases would have a huge advantage over everything else. Because if you had a choice what would you store your money in? It also insures that bitcoins can never artificially be devalued by any central organization. Sure new bitcoins can be mined, but that's heavily limited and a necessary evil to distribute the first bitcoins fairly.<p>As for them being collectibles that may be true for some people, but they have a few very good advantages to them that can't be beat by other currencies and that insures they will always have a use as a currency with some people. Mainly that they are anonymous and don't have transaction fees. I have seen a lot of interesting uses for them that would be unfeasible in real world currencies.

DMC4 begins with the series' half-demon protagonist crashing into a church and assassinating the pope.

The only way to play GTA subversively is to actually attempt to follow the law except when instructed not to (something Pippin Barr tried in [1]).<p>[1 pg. 200] <a href=""http://www.pippinbarr.com/academic/Pippin_Barr_PhD_Thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pippinbarr.com/academic/Pippin_Barr_PhD_Thesis.pd...</a>",1365794472

It seems a common sentiment that 3D printers are somehow just an industrial thing, or otherwise only good for hobbyists. I disagree.<p>I've used several different models of 3D printers, from the cheapest, to home brewed, to industrial grade, and even the fancy UV cured resin ones. Honestly they really are great for a number of purposes:<p>1. Quickly getting a near-full fidelity part to hold in your hand. Whether you're engineering something or doing something around the house, there is no substitute for having the thing in your hand.<p>2. Fast ""create and forget"" replacements. Handle on your workbench broken/missing/shitty? Print one that fits, screw it on and forget about it. No driving to the hardware store, browsing around, paying, ""oops the screw holes are too far apart"" etc. How many times have you been making something out of wood at home and only gone to the hardware store to get a handle/hinge/pin?<p>3. Making 3D parts that would be a huge pain, or impossible, to machine by hand or via cnc. Really, anybody who has spent some time machining parts will tell you that there is more to making a decent part than just designing it and hopping on the mill. Do you have the right tooling? How are you going to hold it? Do I have enough material to hold? What speeds and feeds do I need to use? CNC machining adds an entire extra layer of CAD, and then you still have to worry about most of that stuff.<p>4. Making several different versions of something, because you aren't sure which one will fit best, look nicest or suck the least. It's pretty rare to see people machine (or even wood form) 5 parts that are identical except for the position of some groove. It just takes too much time, and it's boring.<p>Don't get me wrong, there's still tons of room for improvement for additive processes, and sometimes a mill or a table saw is a great tool for the job, but enough with this ""overbuzz"" business. No, you will not be printing out CPUs any time soon, but that doesn't make 3D printers all ""buzz"".<p>EDIT: Formatting.",1365794286

It sure sounds good, but it's not even close to reality.</i><p>To support your point a little bit, some video game scholars, like Espen Aarseth, don't buy into the idea what the representations provide any relevancy:<p>[1]: ""The ""royal"" theme of the traditional pieces is all but irrelevant to our understanding of chess. Likewise, the dimensions of Lara Croft's body, already analyzed to death by film theorists, are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently (see sidebar). When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it.""<p>While Aarseth has been quite extreme in his rejection of narrative, the main aspect of his argument is that gamers see the underlying constructs of the gameplay systems, and I think gamers choose whether to engage with the dressing that sits on top. Bioshock Infinite tells a story that you can listen to, but when you're playing you're not listening.<p>This explains the disconnect between players of GTA and observers. Those who observe and go ""YOU KILLED THAT PROSTITUTE TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND YOU DON'T EVEN CARE"" are viewing the game at the narrative level; whereas the gamers who do this are working at the mechanics level. It is a fallacy to then believe that those gamers are more susceptible to perform those actions they see at the narrative level in real life, as they were never there in the first place. The prostitutes aren't people, they're walking wallets. Bioshock tried to play with this idea with the Little Sisters, but I felt it ultimately failed, as the Little Sisters were sufficiently dehumanized that they looked a lot like walking health packs who would be put out of their misery.

They describe the millions that they make as payment for all the 'value' that they've given to everyone; But, as an ignorant, I can't see how those millions could have come from anywhere than other (less informed) peoples' pockets.</i><p>Trading is a legitimately socially useful business, but it's winner-take-all. Yes, they provide liquidity and, in doing so, capture <i>proportionately</i> small amounts of money that other principals don't care about. If you need to move $25 million, are you going to notice a difference of a few hundred dollars that an arbitrageur collects (by taking the other side of a bid he judged to be 0.37 cents high? No. You want your trade to go off. Principals would lose money to the bid-ask spread no matter who's in the market; arbitrageurs narrow it by competing against each other.<p>So why do traders make so much money? Because they're better or more useful than software engineers? No. Because they steal it? No, not that either. Software engineers are seen by the business as cost centers, even in 90+ percent of startups and even at Google (closed allocation).<p>For traders, it's a different story. If Bob is a little better than Mark, Bob will get 100% of the business and Mark will get nothing. At this point, to do arbitrage you need to be thinking about <i>micro</i>seconds. If Bob can execute in 75 mcs and Mark takes 100 mcs, then Bob is going to get all the trades. Trading shops <i>must</i> be meritocracies because they have no other option. If they can't hire good traders, then there's no reason to keep working.<p>Because trading is winner-take-all, trading houses put a <i>lot</i> of money back into compensation: 40 to 50 percent profit sharing (in a way that, outside of direct P&L roles, is subject to politically fucked-up performance just like everything else) is the norm. That'd be like a typical software company paying $250k-500k bonuses.<p>If we, as software engineers, want to make trading money (not the 5-10m outliers, but 250-1M, then we need to think about profit sharing-- <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a> -- instead of this startup equity that pays off in the distance future, and is subject to horrible terms).

The students would attend ungraded seminars at night on art and literature, and the faculty would consist of professionals the students would work with as well as traditional professors.</i>\n--<p>This is what we do in what we call ""Zoho University"" within our company. We hire students out of high school, and they go through a program that has a mix of classroom instruction focused on extensive programming exercises with a heavy dose of interaction with people building products.

I would rate my PhD as idle mathematical game playing. That would have been OK as a hobby, I just wish I had not gifted 4 years of life to its pursuit.

The hooks are all global in scope. It all works, but it is all over the place. Using Drupal makes me feel productive, but dirty.

It really depends on how you define electronic as well. If Chain Reaction is repetitive, Plus 8 less so, Warp less so, but even less are labels like Wax Trax! that had much more dynamic and traditional song structures from their artists (industrial). Do you consider them electronic? Subjective. Labels like Mo Wax delivered far less repetitive offerings than Warp artists, and just as compelling. Ghostly International takes takes us back to more traditional electronic offering if Mo Wax and Wax Trax! aren't 'electronic' enough for one's definition.<p>Really, there are just too many to name, even with the constraint of stripping out electronic music subjectively deemed 'repetitive'.<p>But I take your point though. Warp Records, especially at a particular time in electronic music's history, was one of those special and legendary labels that every genre seems to have one or two of. They were home to some of the most compelling and innovative artists of their generation, and rather than having just one or two, they were home to many. Might be the best electronic music label in history for strength of talent and how deep their roster went.<p>And I too have a lawn, but you don't need to get off it, -instead you can hang out on it and bring your vinyl.

There's a wider exposure to ideas, perhaps (because maybe you jump between internships instead of staying with one), but at its most basic level the proposed idea is training people to do jobs instead of trying to expand their thinking minds. Yes, there's lip service given to seminars, but it's evident in the quote (Traditional universities list the Nobel laureates ours would list the entrepreneurs, inventors, and executives) that academics are held in a certain amount of contempt.<p>Let me be clear: I don't think there's anything wrong with this vision. This approach would probably be a success. It may be needed. The problem is this: somehow we mutated universities into a place where everyone goes in order to get a job. I think we benefit from having more people being educated at a university level, but that benefit is not purely practical. I don't think the point of getting higher education is getting a job. I think it's an extension of the same reason we go to school: because an educated population drives knowledge further. Because when a large part of the population gets a Bachelors of some sort, they can reason better. And because when there are more people at that knowledge level, a larger part than before gets a Ph.D. And that helps society and humanity move forward faster.<p>There's a tension right now between the university as a place to expand your mind and learn for the sake of learning and the university as a place where you prepare for a job. I think it's a good idea to play with that tension and that balance, and see what balance leads to better results in what way. But I think there is absolutely a place for universities as they are today, and I think their existence is part of what has driven us forward at the frenetic pace that we have seen the last several decades.",1354290746
4853705,comment,4853208,4853208,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"Education intersects with two problem areas that have historically been correlated:<p>1. Knowledge sharing. Books no longer take three months of a person's time to copy, but <$0.01 of electricity. Video lectures are now freely available. This is awesome! But it's not the full picture when it comes to education. You also need frisbee games and poetry nights.<p>2. ""Social"". This includes credentialing, social networking, and creation of an environment (in college, a mostly parentally funded and artificial one) conducive to rapid learning.<p>The second of these is much harder, because people still believe that exclusivity is necessary to preserve quality (and, sadly, they are not entirely wrong). I've said before that there are two sub-problems in social. One is <i>documenting</i> existing relationships. That's lucrative but does little real good for the world. The second is to <i>expand</i> the social graph. That does a lot of good but it's also risky and rarely remunerative because some people (and the <i>vast</i> majority of the powerful) <i>like</i> exclusivity.

Another crack-pot thought - figure out how to decrease the speed of mutations that bacteria are subjected to. Something along the lines of biological or synthetic error correction on DNA.<p>At some point (have we crossed it?) human evolution has moved from physical 'fitness tests' to non-physical. When we get colder now we just design thicker clothes and warmer buildings, etc. Heart disease? more pills and surgeries. I've read people make an interesting case that corn is one of the most successful organisms as measured by adapting to fit because over time it became the corner stone of our entire diet as a species. And by that line of reasoning the genetic modification we do as humans on corn is part of corns continued adaptation. A little meta perhaps, but eventually I wonder how much control we'll have over the biology so that the mutations and modifications would seem artificial and human designed by today standards.",1354290515

Art-world folk are perhaps overeager to shoehorn games into their definition of ""art"" (which is naturally rather nebulous). Just because a piece of software has NES-era graphics and allows you to use the keyboard to move a sprite around does not, to my mind, instantly qualify it as a game.<p>By a similar token, a box containing a blank white board and a single six-sided die does not instantly attain the status of a board game. And even though it is, perhaps, art--and fully something I'd expect to see in a board game exhibit in a museum of modern art--I wouldn't begrudge board game enthusiasts (of which I know <i>many</i>) if they grumbled at how such a ""useless"" exhibit was soaking up attention that could have been devoted to a game that was more substantial, more influential, and more representative of what board games really are.<p>But at the end of the day we're still just disagreeing over the definition of ""art"", which is perhaps the least constructive argument that has ever taken place in the history of humanity. :)",1354290483

4853496,comment,4852611,4852888,5,0,unconed,,,"I'm a proto-geek who kind of taught himself to be more artistic. Let me share a few tips:<p>- Learning to draw is not actually so much about drawing, but learning how to see. Light is complicated and humans like to abstract, especially geeks, so when we look around, we rarely actually see what's there. When you look at e.g. a shiny teakettle, you need to see the specific reflections in the metal, rather than just parsing it into ""shiny bowl"". When you look at faces, you need to learn to spot the shadows and the curves from various angles, e.g. a face in profile vs a face head on. Even simple objects can be deceptive, e.g. put a box on a surface, and it will create a subtle border of shadow around its base due to indirect light bounces. I found drawing from photographs was best for learning this, as it's pre-flattened into 2D. Also, there is a reason that artists study the anatomy of skeletons and musculature to draw nudes.<p>- To make matters worse, our eyes and brains suffer from various optical illusions. This means that you should not strive something that is right, but something that looks right. For example, horizontally aligning an asymmetrical shape... sometimes it just looks more balanced slightly off-center. Or go into Inkscape and type the text ""XOXOXO"". Zoom in, and you can tell that 1) the X' diagonals don't meet at a central point and 2) the O sticks out a bit below and above the X. Both are there to 'fix' optical illusions. Also, because of the difference between left brain and right brain, often it helps to flip your image horizontally midway to see all the flaws.<p>- When it comes to design (rather than just art), the motto is ""it is perfect not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"". This can make it hard to see why a design is good. The best way I've found is to try and copy an existing design, but only by studying it once at the start. When you're done, you can compare with the original, and suddenly all the artists' specific choices will stand out. Doing this to CSS Zen Garden designs taught me web design.",1354288195

They are okay, but don't really have a whole lot of value because it is too easy to 'cram for the exam' - there are even services in many countries that help with this.  I wouldn't want to hire someone solely based on their certificates or badges - I'd want to see a portfolio of their work, hear from previous co-workers, and of course speak with the person to see about their skills in communicating and working with others.<p>And outside of some technical skills or rote knowledge, most skills can't be so easily measured by test questions.<p>A better argument for a 'new college' would highlight how right now a college degree doesn't really indicate what a person has learned, and the evidence points to not much actual learning happening in college (see Academically Adrift: <a href=""http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/18/study_finds_large_numbers_of_college_students_don_t_learn_much"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/18/study_finds_la...</a>).

For example in the tech sector, more companies are looking for graduates that have experience rather then just a CS degree. There are free resources to learn how to code like Codeacademy, Udacity, Coursera, Mozillas P2PU, Google Code University, and MIT Open Courseware. There are also more and more high-quality paid resources, both online and off, like General Assembly, Treehouse or Bloc, not to mention local continuing ed classes.

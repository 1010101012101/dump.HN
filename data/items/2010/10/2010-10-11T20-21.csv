Log Monitoring and Management: Not sure what they mean by this; surely it's something more complex than logrotate. Maybe rsyslog or something?<p>2. Continuous Vulnerability Monitoring: So, they follow the usual script sites & mailing lists.<p>3. Managed Anti-Virus Protection: I hope they aren't running on a Windows platform, and if they aren't, I'm not aware of very many current in-the-wild viruses for the various Linux distros.<p>4. 1 Gigabit Networking Infrastructure (Public and Private): Heh.<p>5. Two-Factor Authentication: I see this a bit, and it's usually mis-used. Unless they require you to physically submit a fingerprint, DNA sample, retinal image, or some other such thing, then it's not two-factor authentication.<p>6. Application and Database Server Isolation: They're running the application and the SQL instances on different servers, but if the application server gets compromised, then so does the SQL server, since the application needs automated credentials for the SQL server.<p>7. Managed SSL Service: Once a year they make sure your certificate is up-to-date.<p>8. Business Associate Agreement Friendly: What?<p>9. Managed Redundant Firewall Protection: Not sure what they mean by this. Either your firewall works, or it doesn't. Layering them doesn't do squat. If they mean that they have a hot spare ready to go in case of an outage, then that's a little better -- but still not that helpful if the app server or db server falls over for any reason.<p>10. Managed Redundant Web Application Protection (Port 80/443): What?<p>11. Managed Redundant DoS/DDoS Mitigation: This is nice, at least, since it requires a bit of infrastructure to do it right -- assuming that they can stand up to a multi-terabit-per-second hit, since that's what the botnets are packing these days.<p>12. Managed and Monitored Intrusion Detection: So, run-of-the-mill IDS + Nagios + remote logging.<p>13. Managed Proactive Operating System Security Patches: This is a lie unless they're personally writing and submitting patches. The most ""proactive"" you're likely to get otherwise is running a nightly update.<p>14. Managed Weekly Full Backups + Daily Differentials (Encrypted): I want to take just a moment here and toot our own horn: we do weekly fulls + daily differentials for our <i>regular</i> web hosting customers, for a heck of a lot less than $845 a month. They aren't currently encrypted, but that wouldn't be all that challenging to add on.<p>15: Highly Secure Data Center Environment: You can probably get the same ""highly secure data center environment"" from Rackspace, Hurricane Electric, or any of a number of other really big hosting providers.<p>16: VPN/SSL Provided for Server Management (RDP/SSH/FTP/SQL): Nice, but again, really not that hard to set up, especially for a turn-key environment.<p>TL;DR: I'm really surprised both at what qualifies as ""HIPAA compliant hosting"" as well as at the price charged for it.

Show me some data that there isn't a lag between wages and prices.  As far as I know, typically the way that people get their wages to keep up with inflation is by shifting jobs horizontally or vertically.  All evidence shows that that's not working so well.  In the 50s a family could survive on one salary working a 40-50 hour work week.  We're increasingly seeing families requiring two breadearners pulling 50-80 hour weeks.<p>I think my argument is sound.  All I'm saying is that the blanket statement that inflation is beneficial to poor people is flat out wrong.  Consider also that poor people aren't getting fixed rate mortgages (more like variable rate ones - which are worse) and aren't investing in stocks or bonds which at least have a chance of beating inflation (if you play it right and get out before crashes).

1781104,comment,1780348,1780348,0,0,ntalbott,,,"Full disclosure: I run Spreedly, an earlier to market but much less funded competitor to Chargify.<p>Here's the dirty little secret that Spreedly discovered about 18 months ago, and that I'm sure Chargify - like Recurly before them - has now found out for themselves: there are plenty of people who want to start subscription businesses, and out of those, the <i>vast</i> majority will not succeed and will actually end up costing more than they ever bring in. That leaves businesses in this space two options: either focus on successful startups and actively filter out the ""losers"" (by charging a minimum of $99/month, for instance), or minimize costs for ""low probability"" businesses - and they're all low probability early on! - and use ""cheap to try things out"" as a star search for the few businesses that will end up getting big.<p>Note that Chargify paired this price increase announcement with two other significant announcements that have largely been overshadowed by the hullabaloo: PCI Level 1 compliance, and 24/7 phone support. This pairing is not coincidence - I'm pretty confident that the pricing change is very firmly tied internally to these two new ""features"". PCI Level 1 compliance is a hefty upfront cost <i>plus</i> a large ongoing price tag. Good 24/7 phone support is crazy expensive to provide, and means that free customers would eat their lunch since so much of the support needs for one of these businesses is on the front end.<p>The <i></i>ridiculously huge<i></i> mistake I think Chargify made here was something I thought was just a given these days: they should've unilaterally grandfathered all of their existing clients, and quietly given the grandfathered plan to anyone who was already integrating but not yet launched as well. When Spreedly made our last pricing change - from percent of transaction fee to flat per transaction fee - it was a price drop for most of our customers. But not all: anyone with super low prices would've ended up paying us more, so we explicitly made it the minimum of $0.20 or 2% of the transaction. There's just no excuse for ticking off existing customers - it makes you look like a cell phone company. Even if you absolutely have to raise prices across the board, I think three months of warning is the absolute minimum amount of time to give a customer base before you hit them with the increase.<p>So, that's my $0.02 - hope it helps folks understand why I think this is happening. Questions, feedback, etc., welcome.<p>P.S. I think in some areas Chargify's definitely ahead of Spreedly Subscriptions in terms of functionality - all of that extra capital definitely shows in the end product. But that's because we've been focused on ""what's next"" after you figure out the naive business model doesn't work in this space. I said above that there are two options. That's a lie - we're working on a third option. If there are any angels reading this that would like to invest in a team that's been thinking deeply about this space since before Chargify and Recurly were a twinkle in their founder's eye, drop me a line.",1286828748

Many people just went from 0 to $1200 per year.<p>I'm guessing the cost of supporting the formerly free (0-50 customers) tier is close to zero from a technical/infrastructure perspective, but relatively high from a support/feedback perpective.<p>People in the free tier will either grow or go out of business. For those that grow, your cost is the same - you'll have the same questions whether you charge them day 1 or day 100.<p>So the real issue is the cost of support for those who signup for the free tier and either flake out or go out of business.<p>In my opinion, the rate of customer growth you'll get from having a free tier is worth the extra support cost. With no barrier in place, people will try Chargify, see that it's a high quality product, and if they have a viable business, will use it. That was our experience.<p>With a barrier in place ($100/month from day 1), they'll do a lot of research and probably try the cheaper options before trying Chargify.<p>For our particular case, I'm quite happy with Chargify as a product, but quite unhappy about the way the pricing was handled. With the former pricing tier we had the luxury of growing in cost as we grew in revenue. With the new pricing structure we have an immediate unexpected cost.<p>Now we have to go and investigate the other recurring payment options, which bums me out entirely, since I was hoping we were well past that.<p>You should, at the very least, grandfather the old users into the old plan. In my opinion you should keep the free tier around, but find ways to reduce your support costs. For my business, we treat support questions as the leading indicator for where we need to make the product more intuitive. We invest in improving the product, thereby also reducing costs.<p>Of course that's just my opinion.",1286828459

The Axiom of Choice sounds quite innocuous: If you have a bunch of sets, you can construct a new set by picking one element out of each of them.<p>Turns out you can reason your way from that to ""I can make any solid 3d object into any other solid 3d object just by cutting and rearranging the parts"".  (Banach-Tarski is often explained as the ability to turn one sphere into two, which is true, but the full implication is more along the lines of being able to rearrange a pea into the earth.)  This is just one of many scary dragons that lurk in set theory.<p>Historically speaking, Banach-Tarski is <i>why</i> the Axiom of Choice is controversial.  The other (I forget, nine?) axioms in ZFC, garner a tepid response--along the lines of, ""Hooray, someone axiomatized set theory.""  But AC remained controversial for a long, long time.  I cannot find the quote, but there was a mathematician who refused to accept the Axiom of Choice, and when asked about it, commented, ""It is because I do not believe one and one make three.""  He was referencing Banach-Tarski.<p>That is the dilemma that has faced mathematicians historically: either reject something so innocuous as the Axiom of Choice or embrace something so nonsensical as the Banach-Tarski paradox.  ""Controversial"" is putting it lightly; that's a hard decision.  One still sees textbooks that flag all theorems depending on the axiom of choice, so you can reject them if you want to.  I would say the field as a whole has come to embrace AC and accept Banach-Tarski; one of my professors one commented, ""If we need the axiom of choice in this proof, we'll use it; why do mathematics with one arm tied behind your back?""  I think this reflects the common attitude. But it wasn't an easy choice.<p>And that's the joke.  If the guy didn't want one pumpkin to equal two, he should have gone the other way and rejected AC.  It is not unfair to characterize Banach-Tarski as the sorry consequence of something mathematicians really wanted to do -- collateral damage, the lesser evil.  One could regret it.",1286828256

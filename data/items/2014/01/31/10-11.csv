You have to make sure they don&#x27;t totally suck - but the important place to optimise is the common case.<p>...<p>It turns out there is a way you can gain almost all of the benefits you&#x27;re looking for - which is delayed MODSEQ allocation.  Newly delivered messages can be created with no MODSEQ.  When you sync with another either client or server, you allocate a MODSEQ higher than than any which the other end has seen.<p>Which means you only pay an extra cost if a JMAP peer or client connects at both ends during the link downtime.",1391165352

This notion of the elite nature of the British Empire serves no purpose other than to polarize the people of that tiny nation against all others .. and this is terribly shocking.<p>The British people will <i>never</i> be truly safe for as long as they continue to deny their own empires criminal behaviour.

7156117,comment,7153272,7154061,2,0,lgeek,,,"Well, you&#x27;ll find the glorious smartphone screens are sold as replacement screens for smartphones.<p>But of course, smartphones tend to have an LCD controller on the SoC, so you just get a raw LCD parallel interface. That means the LCD has a tiny connector with dozens of wires. Hobbyists are often enough scared of soldering SMD parts, they won&#x27;t try to solder that .4mm pitch connector.<p>Then you realise that even for 800x600 @ 60Hz you need a pixel clock of around 36 MHz, so you probably need a hardware controller, you can&#x27;t really get away with DMA and/or bit banging. Since you have an external controller, you can&#x27;t do any of the memory efficient drawing like Nintendo NES or sifteo[0], so you&#x27;ll need external buffer memory, probably at least 2 MB to fit two (16 bit colour) frames for double buffering.<p>As the resolution grows, pixel clock frequency and memory size requirements grow quite quickly. Soon enough you get limited by the bandwidth between your MCU and controller, by limitations of parallel interfaces and have to switch to LVDS and so on.<p>Most of these issues become much less relevant if a (even small) company wants to design, manufacture and sell something like this. But I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a demand. For most projects a small screen (with a controller chip and available for cheap because it was designed and manufactured at scale for older phones) works well enough (and you can get away with using a wimpy 8 bit MCU). If you need a larger screen, it&#x27;s probably cheaper to get a low cost single board computer and a computer monitor. Economies of scale and all that.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/12/05/how-we-built-a-super-nintendo-out-of-a-wireless-keyboard-sifteo-sifteo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/12/05/how-we-built-a-supe...</a>",1391164830

In short, we love our bare metal and you are not going to be able to rip it out of our cold dead hands. It is stable, fast and cost efficient.<p>Now for the long winded:<p>1. We do have a decent amount of spares but not a ton. Our contracts require replacement parts within hours to a day. Some items like F5 gear we have two and no spare. They just replace their gear in hours.<p>2. Each data center has 24/7 support that can do some minor tasks.<p>3. Yes, Networking is a pain and you need the right people to do it. It is not cheap either! Luckily our VP of Tech Ops is a networking guru.You mess up networking and you are hosed. Our first networking guy wasn&#x27;t exactly Tops! So, we know first hand.<p>Having said all of that, for us there are economies of scale. It is the case if we want to test different machines, databases or any other combination at scale it could cost us several hundred thousand dollars just to run the tests. Yep, we have dropped over 100k for testing at scale. Its simply not sustainable and an irresponsible way to spend investors cash.  Also, when you add in multiple environments for dev, test, staging and integration you can quickly see we consume a lot of boxes. So, many in fact, a lot of colocation/cloud services will not work with us unless we plop down large amounts of cash. Let&#x27;s also factor in AWS wants large up front spend for reserved instances. Thus, if you need the capital to get the amount of compute you need to run your business it is not very hard just to call Dell, Cisco, Nimbix, Equinix or any other vendor and negotiate our own deals.

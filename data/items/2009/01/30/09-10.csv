We were with the group of pickup artists detailed in the book, watching them work; one of the pickup artists went up to a girl and asked her, ""do you want to go and get weird?""<p>My friend Sean Parker, who was with us, exclaimed with satisfaction, ""I love that!  'Do you want to go and get weird' ... What a perfect way to describe the situation!""  And it was true -- it was an utterly honest, accurate description; and it took a certain type of utterly honest, semi-crazy person to say it.<p>I remember going  to a party in New York with Martin Schaedel a few months ago, wherein he went up to a girl, said hi to her by her first name, and then asked her why she wasn't wearing her engagement ring or accompanied by her fianc√©e.  When the red-faced, astonished girl asked how he had known all of this, Martin deadpanned and said, ""well, I ran a background check on you last week.""  Needless to say, I burst out laughing.  Here, my friends, was a guy who liked to get weird.<p>In our industry, as in most industries, we constantly celebrate the in-your-face, out-in-public superstars and pundits.  We fail to celebrate people such as Martin.  They aren't looking for massive fame or acceptance; rather, they just want to do interesting stuff and live an interesting life.  They are the true hackers -- hacking not only through code and business, but through the very way they lead their lives.<p>This is what I enjoyed the most about Martin, and what I hope this community should take away from his ever-too-short existence -- that you can do it all in an entirely different way.  In fact, you can live such an insanely global, social, real-time existence that even those who meet you in person question whether you are really the person who is standing before them (mainly because they are so caught up in the standard model that they can't imagine such an enormously successful deviation).  It really saddens me to know that he is gone; the full story of this amazing guy and his amazingly improbable life will forever be incomplete, told only in bits and pieces.<p>Hack your life.",1233309387

457923,comment,457860,457860,0,0,lunchbox,,,"The best thing to happen to photography since the digital camera? Come on. The ""cool"" factor of Photosynth is undeniable, but the author doesn't address what Photosynth can actually be useful for once the novelty wears off (in my case, about 3 minutes in). A few points:<p>- Creating decent Synths is a PITA. You need either a huge number of photos or extreme care in making them evenly spaced and overlapping; otherwise your Synth will end up fragmented and will not render right. I was very disappointed with the results when I tried making a Synth of my bedroom and surroundings.<p>- We already have advanced video and photo technology, which obviates many conceivable uses of Photosynth. For example, 360 degree cameras (as found in Google Maps Street View) provide a <i>much</i> better user experience for providing virtual tours of physical locations. Or, simpler yet, just hold up a video camera and film the location, panning into and out of areas of interest.<p>Photosynth must have <i>some</i> practical future uses for Microsoft to be investing in it (unless this is just for publicity); I'm just disappointed the article didn't address what these might be. Maybe they're just reusing the same technology they use to patch together different satellite images for Live Maps.",1233308743

Relatively few public companies pay a dividend, and basically none of the other companies face shareholder lawsuits about the absence of a dividend.<p>Relatively few public companies are in Citi's situation.  I wasn't saying all public companies have to a pay a dividend or face a lawsuit.  Supposing Citi is practically insolvent, it would be irresponsible (legally/fiduciarily, not morally) to shareholders not to try and launder out as a much money as possible.  Once it is paid to shareholders as a dividend, creditors can't go after it.",1233308583

Furthermore, they're supposed to be unique per record.""<p>There are no rules you know :/\nFor something like this, where you're just trying to make a log of IPs unreadable by the government/hackers/whatever, I'd still say a hash is the best bet.<p>Your point about may as well encrypt is a valid one, but may result in higher complexity/cpu usage/mem usage/storage, for not much added security. It depends just how secure you want to be.<p>I think we've flogged this one to death though :)",1233308525

457916,comment,456300,457883,0,0,sho,,,"Digg? No need to get insulting.<p>Anyway, you're wrong about almost everything. You misunderstand what a hash function is. It is not an encryption algorithm. Both the hash and the salt are <i>supposed</i> to be known to the attacker. And by the way, salts are supposed to be <i>unique per record</i>.<p>An ideal hash function is supposed to be an irreversible, unfakeable process regardless of the attacker's knowledge of all components going in. That knowledge is assumed! My whole point is that while this is a very useful tool, it doesn't work for data sets small enough to brute force. This is elementary.<p>Your response, cobbling together some kind of poor man's encryption by padding out the plaintext before hashing with a secret salt, is ridiculous. If you have a secret key then just ENCRYPT!<p>Geeze man, GP was a bit rude, but if you're this stubborn about something you're obviously wrong about, maybe you <i>should</i> keep far away from security ..",1233308140

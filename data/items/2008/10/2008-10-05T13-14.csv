Or you can count how many 'degrees of freedom' your code allows you to have, and be sure that you need to control each of those. C++ affords too much freedom for developer.<p>The trend meanwhile is towards reducing complexity at system/core level and focusing on application unique added value. Today, in large web applications, complex behavior is build using simple components. Those components are normally done in C, and then wrapped by some scripting language. C is not too flexible. The components are rock-solid as a result, they lack unexpected behaviour. Their code's 'degrees of freedom' are easier to control.<p>On top of that, there is trend towards frameworks in scripting languages which reduces 'degrees of freedom' at core/foundation level even further. Finally, there is this REST thing that wants to standardize API of a typical web app, offering us even larger blocks to code to work with. Again, all these trends have one objective - allowing to focus on unique application functionality, on interaction with other systems etc and hiding underlying complexity from the developer.<p>By using C++ you are likely to get complex behaviour in your code very early, at a very fundamental level. As you add functionality, the complexity/behaviour quirks will grow exponentially and you will fail.<p>I am convinced that Microsoft failure with Vista is mostly due to them using C++. They were simply defeated by mounting complexity, not by lack of engineering talent. Meanwhile, Unix success (Apple OS X included) is determined by relative 'dumbness' of underlying C language, Unix tradition of small single-purpose tools etc.",1223215062

Trust me this guy is an ace in the hole.  He like me is worried these guys have lied before and are doing it once again.<p>Were not asking for anything outrageous, we just want to know what is In the stock agreement.  When you're told sign here and well tell you by those that have lied multiple times, that is the problem",1223215051

324087,comment,323787,324064,0,0,mike,,,"I think you might be over-reacting to these provisions.  It's entirely normal that you sign over ownership of the code to the company in exchange for your equity.  That's in every form stock agreement.  Are you using an experienced startup lawyer?  It sounds like maybe you are not.  You don't need a big fancy law firm, but you do need a lawyer who is very familiar with startups and standard terms.  You should confirm that your lawyer has worked with many clients who have negotiated with startups.",1223214095

324083,comment,323787,323957,0,0,mike,,,"Not so clear cut.  You would need to be very careful if you tried to pull this.  Look at the facts he explained.  The investors are just coming in now, and the founders are saying that the stock agreement depends on the investors' lawyers.  That's actually pretty reasonable in a situation where you have a bunch of inexperienced founders getting money from experienced investors.  The investors might force the founders to agree to different terms in their own stock agreements as well.  It's not at all clear that the founders have breached anything yet.  If he was to take the code elsewhere, that act could actually be considered the breach.",1223213798

If this project is big enough that the founders would actually fight you, then you definitely should not assume that no written agreement equals no deal.  Unfortunately, the short answer is that it's complicated.",1223213245

One of my computers was called the Crapple (dual inherited from cripple and crap).<p>I've owned four Apple computers (ibook G3, ibook G4, imac G5, macbook), and despite skipping first revisions and treating my computers very well, every single one of them has had several minor defects and all my notebooks have broken completely within a 3 year time frame.<p>In my personal experience, Apple is a hardware bimbo - pretty but useless. I only come back for OS X, which is the nicest desktop 'nix. I wish apple were still apple <i>computers</i>, not apple media.<p>I'm waiting for the next mb/mbp's, but if anyone has tips for alternatives, I'd love to hear them.",1223212890

No specific details, just a simple hand written promise at this moment, with a specific 3 or 4 week deadline to make this formal. If they say no, you tell them that they are acting in bad faith, and that you are going to stop work immediately.<p>An agreement is an agreement - if you have emails or chat messages or so on, that's already a contract.<p>They have a choice - give you something handwritten now or they lose their developer at the point where they are about to close a deal, which is a really bad time. They will tell you that this is the wrong time to apply pressure, but for you, this is exactly the right time. This is when they are most vulnerable because the deal could fall through, so this is your best chance to get this through.<p>When they have investment, how useful do you think you will be? They will just get rid of you and hire someone new.",1223212548

9116942,comment,9112885,9112885,0,0,lisa_henderson,,,"I briefly worked with a startup that has built their whole system using Python (though they use things like ElasticSearch, so they also run the JVM). The programmers at this startup are very intelligent, and very thoughtful. There are 4 main programmers. Their background is a mix: some of them were initially scientists, some were computer science engineers. They are all in their late 20s and early 30s. The startup began in 2011.<p>Because they are so thoughtful and talented, whenever they see a flaw in a 3rd party library, they give up on that library, and they try to write their own.<p>So for instance:<p>They tried using Chef for configuration, but they didn&#x27;t like Ruby. Then they tried Ansible, but they found it immature. The tried Puppet, but didn&#x27;t like that it had a central daemon. So they started writing their build/config system, which they released as open source. Their system has some unusual ideas, a heavy reliance on bash, and an emphasis on supporting a polyglot system. However, this took a lot of time that could have been directed at the specific needs of the startup.<p>They decided they would need a system of dependency injection. In Python it is common to configure some variables at the level of the module, but they felt this lead to tight coupling. They did not like any existing system for dependency injection for Python, so they wrote their own. They released this as open source. Their DI system borrows a lot of ideas from Angular. It is clever and they have long debates about how to make it better. But this also took time that could have gone to the specific needs of the startup.<p>They needed a framework that would allow them to serve a website out over Nginx. They reviewed all of the existing Python web/application servers. They found flaws in all of them: Zope, Pylons, Flask, etc. They decided to build their own. They based their work on Flask but they added a lot of their own unique ideas. They released it as open source. It has been a big effort and it is still missing certain features. For instance, they started off assuming that all of the pages of their site would require a login. When they eventually had to add in some pages that did not require a login, they had to re-work the way they were handling security and authorization. All of this has taken time away from the specific needs of the startup. And, of course, their software may have security flaws which they have not yet discovered. Although it is open source, I don&#x27;t believe anyone else is using their software.<p>They decided they needed a way to enforce contracts on the structure of the documents moving through their system, and they wanted a system that could work almost exactly the same in Python and in Angular. So they built their own library for validating the structure of documents. They built out a whole vocabulary for the &quot;types&quot; in their system, using types which were generic enough that they could work in both Python and Javascript. It is an interesting system, but it takes at least 25% of the time of the most senior engineer. If they did not write their own system, he would have at least an extra 10 hours a week to put toward tasks that are specific to the needs of the startup.<p>They wanted to store JSON but they did not like any of the JSON document stores that were available in 2011/2012. They love PostGres. This was before PostGres had a JSON column type. So they decided they would store JSON in PostGres as a string in a TEXT column. They wrote a library that serializes and deserializes the string. They built this as a layer on top of SqlAlchemy. Their code is very clever: you can query the database with their ORM and you always get back objects, you never have to think about JSON as a string. In some ways, they have reinvented the idea of an &quot;object database&quot; that was popular in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s. These are clever ideas, though it took time away from the actual needs of the startup.<p>I could go on. They wrote their own cache system, their own system for transforming data structures, etc.<p>They are thoughtful. When adding a new feature to one of their libraries, they have respectful debates that sometimes last 2 or 3 or even 4 hours. They release everything as open source. They are trying to help the Python community. But it adds up to a huge tax on their time, and it takes them away from the needs of the startup. The founder/CEO is not technical, and I think they often wonder why things take so much time.<p>With startups, it is especially true that &quot;the perfect is the enemy of the good.&quot; Their perfectionist streak takes them away from the needs of the company. They pursue an ideal of absolute brilliance, though they often don&#x27;t have the time they need to make their libraries as good as what they dream of.<p>Having worked with them, I&#x27;ve gained a new respect for the idea that startups should, as much as possible, just use what libraries they can find. All libraries have their quirks, but it is an illusion to think it is cost effective to spend your time re-inventing what&#x27;s out there.",1425005940

But i think you should remember that policy is not formulated and followed to please citizens and academia.<p>There is a long game here. Consider the development and placement of nuclear weapons, specifically mobile systems, in the European Theater during the Cold War [sic]. The point was not MAD. USSR had a 5:1 ratio in terms of tanks. Not USSR v. USA; USSR v. NATO. People [read civilian critics] pay altogether too much attention to the big, scary strategic nukes. Tactical nukes are the real game changer in a conflict. TacNukes can be used for so much more than StratNukes. yet all i ever hear people talk about are the big ones.<p>What i am trying to say is that today&#x27;s losses might be tomorrows gains. The US may have wasted a couple hundred billion, 4000 drones [that word means more than what it is typically used for these days], and a fuck ton of civilians. But the US now has the most experienced army in the world in terms of urban conflict. China is big, India is growing, Russia is heavily armed... but which country has the most JG and NonCom officers with battle experience? Which country has built a private military apparatus in parallel with its State Military apparatus?<p>Again, this shit destroys me on the inside.

9116929,comment,9113976,9116063,0,0,a_c_s,,,"Net neutrality is the way things ran for most of the last 20 years. This is less of a change but a return to what worked well in the recent past. The reason we are even discussing this topic is that telecoms are moving away from net neutrality.<p>A) What happens if your ISP blocks all VOIP traffic unless you buy their phone service bundle? Or throttle all streaming video (which competes with their cable offerings)? In other markets these would be seen as an abuse of monopoly power (which, in many local markets, telecoms are). Given that, is indeed a government concern.<p>B) Any workaround is trivially blocked by the ISP.<p>C) It isn&#x27;t obvious to the consumer why a site is slow, especially if some competing sites do pay the extra fees ISPs are asking for. Again, local monopolies (and oligopolies) mean that telecoms don&#x27;t have much incentive to make their customers happier: at this point nobody is going to forgo internet service entirely.<p>As far as billion dollar enterprises are concerned, Google, Facebook, or Skype could have been squashed in their infancy. AOL search would be the best we ever got - or the only search engine that AOL users could access: there&#x27;s no incentive to improve when you&#x27;re the only option.",1425005714

9116913,comment,9113643,9115558,0,0,Throwaway90283,,,"I should clarify, I think they should be strictly following web standards, and by doing so, they help to force those sites not following standards to update their code, or die. I don&#x27;t want my browser using extra resources, and having extra features and menus to improve compatibility with someone&#x27;s sloppy, hacked together website from the 90s. I&#x27;d rather that site appear broken because it&#x27;s not following standards, and by doing so, it&#x27;s encouraged to update, or be replaced by someone else.<p>I believe this would allow for a smaller browser footprint, and we&#x27;d see better coded websites in the long run, instead of carrying them through.<p>For example, we get a new IE browser, that follows standards to the T. If your site doesn&#x27;t work in IE, it&#x27;s not because &quot;it&#x27;s IE, use a real browser&quot;, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t code your site properly. In the video they talk about how they would previously look at the top 10k websites and ensure compatibility, and now they&#x27;re looking at millions and billions. They shouldn&#x27;t look at anything. If Reddit doesn&#x27;t work in the new version of IE, because they&#x27;re not following standards, then so be it. Don&#x27;t look at methods of relaxing those standards and bending the rules to get Reddit working. Leave it broken, and let the users apply pressure to Reddit because the site isn&#x27;t working in IE. As I said above, they can&#x27;t laugh off IE anymore, because it&#x27;s not some dumb, outdated browser. Instead, it&#x27;s following standards, so Reddit is broken, not IE. It would be the gold standard... in standards. You check to make sure your site works in IE, because if it does, then you coded it right. If your site displays fine in Firefox and Chrome, you don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s coded properly, or if they just held your hand to make it display correctly.",1425005418

This is one area where copying breaks down: that can be a ton of data. BananaBread has a single, low-poly model that it uses for NPCs, and it presumably rarely (if ever?) needs to be re-copied.<p>* Large, seamless worlds. If you can transfer the entire world into a single static GL buffer, sure, copying isn&#x27;t a problem since it only happens once on boot. If you need to incrementally load and unload in chunks, you&#x27;re going to be paying that cost again and again.<p>* Multi-pass rendering. In fact, the proxying approach makes multi-pass rendering impossible, as noted in the blog post.<p>By all means, if your application already works single-threaded, or within the confines of the existing spec, you&#x27;re going to be fine. But memory copies aren&#x27;t free, and UI offloading is one of the biggest reasons to use shared memory.<p>Shared memory in Workers is nice — it doesn&#x27;t make anything worse, and it makes some things better! — but it&#x27;s a little disappointing that the main thread can&#x27;t access the shared memory buffers.

9116853,comment,9111866,9111866,0,0,bayesianhorse,,,"The point of using an ORM is not about avoiding the difficulty of SQL or the ease of switching databases.<p>ORMs are about code reusability.<p>First off, validation of input data is painful without ORMs. Converting data between SQL, your languages&#x27; type system and the user interface in a reusable way almost necessarily leads to an abstraction which looks like an ORM. Not doing so quickly leads to bugs and vulnerabilities. I can usually tell at a glance if Django ORM code leads to an injection vulnerability or not (Hint: Unless there is custom/raw SQL there is no vulnerability). Harder to do in pure SQL.<p>Secondly, queries can be modified and introspected in code. Hard to do with SQL query strings, easy to do with ORMs. With the Django ORM you can progressively filter a query using variables from your context, you can modify a base query to get you a count, an aggregate and a list of model instances, and you can introspect a query for the tables it will touch.<p>Thirdly, an ORM makes queries reusable by different sub systems of your framework. Again in Django, you can pass a Queryset (without evaluating it before it&#x27;s necessary) to the template system, to the input validation (django forms), to form widgets, the introspected admin, REST frameworks and so on.<p>Fourthly, ORMs help manage migrations. Migrating to and from different points of migrations can be hard to do in raw SQL or with your own tools. ORMs aren&#x27;t perfect at this, but SQLAlchemy and the Django ORM both have very good migration tools which save you a lot of time and a lot of frustration, with minimal headache now and then. Migrations are easily testable and easily repeatable.<p>I also believe that ORMs are more important to the framework than for the individual application. A framework can only survive and grow a strong community if it can satisfy a large base of users. For Django&#x27;s success it was necessary to support SQLite, Postgres, Mysql and Oracle, whereas single Django projects might thrive without ever changing to and from Postgres.",1425004229

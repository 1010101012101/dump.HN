All you'd have to do is point a DNS entry for m.ycombinator.com to:<p><a href=""http://yc.mobify.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yc.mobify.me</a><p>Hope you like it!<p>Team Mobify.Me",1234007357

The sense of entitlement of some people in this country is sickening.<p>""I want to ask you to re-finance my mortgage at the current value of my house at a 4.2% rate, like everyone in Congress is suggesting.""<p>Oh, come on.  That's ridiculous.  Basically, everyone that didn't go out and upgrade or buy a big house gets shafted because those that bought big houses would get bailed out to the tune of the current market value and at a rate way below market value for their loan?  That's just foolish and sends the wrong message.<p>I bought a house in the San Francisco Bay Area in the east bay for about 450k in 2001.  The house is still pretty well above water but I have that thing on a fixed rate loan at 5.5%.  I've managed to pay off a decent chunk of the house as well because I stayed conservative.  And because I decided to stay put and not upgrade even though money was cheap I would basically be told to piss off because I did the right thing.  No, no, no.<p>Luckily she has it wrong anyways.  The law being tossed around would only be for people in bankruptcy if I read it correctly but then again it changes every day.<p>I really hope none of what she is hoping for comes to pass.  And if, for some reason there was a relief bill passed, there should be some sort of payback clause in it where they government would be entitled to a portion of any ""profit"" on the house when values start to rise again and the person sells it.  Think of the way affordable housing works where the buyer can't sell it at ""market rate"" - they are only entitled to a certain amount of appreciation each year.  They can even add in credits for capital improvements so the owner still has incentive to maintain the house vs. letting it go into disrepair.",1234007025

471062,comment,470931,470931,0,0,katz,,,"It looks nice. Just my 2 cents (I am not a USA citizen so I don't know the exact conditions):<p>Marketing in small towns is going to be difficult. A lot of small towns lags behind more urban places in internet adoption. Their population are also generally older and less tech savvy than cities - so you should plan for this group (simple interfaces, etc...).<p>You also get small towns that are relatively near each other: if a person wants to buy something $200 + he will happily drive through to the next town. So if you implement a type of map and list nearby towns it may be good.<p>A lot of selling over here happens with small regional papers – a regional paper will cover one or two towns and will be filled with regional news (stuff like school performance, local politics, etc...).  Those papers also contain classified advertisements. If you can maybe link up with one or two of them to put those advertisements online – or provide a system in which they can put advertisements on your system (e.g. show on their website and redirect to yours when a user clicks on the add) it would be great.<p>Most of those papers are usually a one or two man operation without much of a website – you should check if you can get a system in which you supply a CMS type system with your advertisement system to them. You provide the website framework and advertisement system and they fill it with content & advertisements.",1234006265

If developing your product takes a couple of millions of dollars and it is truly innovative then it makes sense to take out a patent because the overhead is relatively low compared to the potential benefits.<p>For instance, the Dyson vacuum cleaner was protected by a patent and it helped them in going after Philips who shamelessly cloned it.",1234004431

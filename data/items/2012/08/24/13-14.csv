4427559,comment,4424330,4425095,1,0,douglasisshiny,,,"I am not advocating for defense contractors making swaths of money. But you stated that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have destroyed wealth. That's not really true. The housing bubble busting, for example, destroyed wealth, as many families' wealth was tied into the value of their home. No one actively lost money because of the wars. Yes, the money added greatly to the deficit and could have been used for infrastructure here. But you can't assume that that money would have simply been spent on items like efficient engine R&D.<p>As for productivity, let me be more clear, too. Productivity per worker (i.e., widgets made) are also at historical highs. Corporations are very lean.",1345816685
4427558,comment,4427031,4427031,7,0,jpallen,,,"Unit testing will also force to decouple your code in a similar way. In the first example it is impossible test individually test all the things the code should do without worrying about everything else that is going on (e.g. you need make sure all the elements exist on the page). By moving to an event trigger like you suggest, you can then test that each listener does the correct thing independently of the others. You can have a separate test for 'selector' and 'yet-another-selector' and they don't need to know about each other. As an added benefit you don't need to mock out your ajax call either. Instead you can just fire a ""DataModel:update"" event in the unit test.<p>I've only recently grokked this aspect of unit testing and I feel like it's made my code an order of magnitude better and more maintainable. Thinking first about how to write code in a decoupled manner also makes unit testing really easy. After having tried unsuccessfully for years to test my code it was a revelation when I that it was because my code was bad that it was hard to test, not that testing is itself hard.<p>Edit: I've tried to illustrate my thoughts more clearly with a copy-cat post to show the parallels between the two: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4427842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4427842</a>",1345816652

The state of Maternity leave in the U.S. is frankly appalling.  My wife (a nurse) is currently pregnant and her Maternity 'leave' is 8 weeks.  She is _required_ to burn all but one week of her vacation time as well as all her sick leave.  After that it's unpaid and if she were to stay on her employer's insurance we would have to pay for it out of pocket for the remaining duration of the leave.<p>Fortunately I have good insurance but this seems incredibly bizarre to me.

Unless you want humanity to eventually degenerate to beyond even the point where everyone is dependent on multiple surgeries simply to live past just being born, then this is something that needs to be though about, discussed, and rectified - no mater how difficult a subject.<p>Some of your questions appear to me to be purposely absurd in order to make the topic seem absurd. To answer your first question though, which is a reasonable one: It may not be a simple answer of some point is too defective, but the answer there must obviously be something other than the current idea that no level of defectiveness is too defective to be aided to breed more unfortunate burdened souls. My personal feeling is that the line has to be somewhere around being too defective to live without medical intervention beyond childhood or perhaps better is the point before one is otherwise able to have children and raise and support them to the age where they are self supportive.<p>Your pointing out that the issue is a complex one with no easy answer does not justify the continued destructive course that humanity is treading down.<p>Regardless of how hard an issue it is to solve, it must be recognized that the current setup of unlimited medical intervention to keep people alive and breeding, no mater how defective, in fact results in a degenerating gene pool, a downward spiral of suffering. This is the true reason why medicare costs keep increasing to the point now where it is the majority expenditure of any western nation (even in America, it is greater there than how much is spent on the military). Again you can see why the medical industrial complex is set on continuing this trend. If not for the limits of economics, this would eventually consume all resources of the world just to keep itself alive with medicine.<p>In some countries this has led to the talk of not providing medical intervention for some groups of people who need it to survive. Unfortunately the talk is always around not giving it to the old people in order to save money. While they may seem less important to save, it is actually the wrong group to withhold intervention from, as saving old people is not destructive to the gene pool. They need to start talking about withholding it from the opposite end of the age spectrum.",1345814671

Say Netscape has 80% of the market of 1M people, and IE4 is popular enough that NS's share dwindles to 30% as IE's rises to 70%. If we're still dealing with 1M total users, the market is zero-sum in that NS's losses are exactly MS's gains.<p>My contention is that IE4 was so good for its time that it grew the overall internet market; instead of 1M casual users, we have, say, 5M. If NS's marketshare fell from 80% of 1M to 30% of 5M, their user base actually went from 800K to 1.5M. IE4 killed them in share, but helped the overall market and Netscape in particular, by users and revenue.<p>To assert that it was a zero-sum game is to assert that the market was inelastic relative to the available browsers, which seems ridiculous.

This lookup isn't even of the URL you visited, but of the SHA-256 of it. This allows to verify if it was a known malware URL, but it is not possible to reverse it and obtain your URL if the hit was a false positive (due to the compression).<p>Firefox has some additional privacy protection here in that it will check a whole bunch of random entries from the local database whenever there is a hit, so even the party at the other end (Google) can't tell what malware URL, if any, you <i>actually</i> hit.<p>Google has added an additional, undocumented SafeBrowsing service to Chrome to check downloaded files, and that one does send the URL off to Google for scanning, but Mozilla has refused to implement this feature in Firefox until the privacy concerns can be addressed.<p>Note that, aside from being much better for privacy, using a local database is obviously of much higher performance than contacting a remote server for every URL.",1345814120

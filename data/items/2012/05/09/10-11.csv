It is the all-pervasive, highest priority plutocracy aspect that is causing the most damage to the US and its image.<p>When your prime concern is to treat your citizens as a tax fund and then on-top of that misappropriate those precious resources in mainly multi-decade long and continuous militaristic campaigns and development instead of socially cohesive and constructive policies that protect the long-term interests of your citizen base, then it is hardly surprisingly the amount of dissatisfaction caused, especially how citizenry itself is becoming globalised by communication and technology.<p>Of particular concern is:<p>* why banks are allowed free reign to cause so much damage without penalty or preventative regulation (e.g. now, subprime is starting all over again except in structured finance commmodity markets),<p>* why large corporates and high wealth individuals are so permitted to abuse accounting principles to avoid taxation even compared to the rest of the West (where do you think this tax revenue will now be sourced from?) and bypass social or environmental responsibilities,<p>* why political campaign funding is allowed to be so corruptingly privatised particularly at the non-federal level,<p>* why (highly funded) private lobbies, even of foreign governments, are permitted to be so powerful against the political system,<p>* why politicians are so protected in office even when they behave in ways that would be illegal in any other situation (e.g. <i>trading</i> based on inside information),<p>* the extreme lengths the ""multicultural experiment"" has been allowed to segregate and ghettoize their citizenry,<p>* the extreme punishment and lack of tolerance for even the most minor of crimes in the legal system, etc. etc.<p>Given the above, it is hardly surprising that US citizens are both turning to and incidentally discovering the many benefits of living elsewhere and dissociating themselves from their parent country's government.",1336561159

To me, it seems ridiculous that anybody would expect to get support by posting something to a random website.  Personally, I go to twitter.com about four times a year and type in the names of my products to do a quick vanity search about what people are saying about them.  I've never seen anything like a support request (or even a complete coherent thought) in there.  It just doesn't seem like something worth monitoring.<p>My product sites all have a contact page with an email address on it.  If you want to contact me, that's how you do it.<p>Amazon has forums with dedicated representatives monitoring them.  That's how you get in touch with them.

3947950,comment,3947103,3947608,8,0,Peaker,,,"Git actually doesn't track cherry-picks, at all, and that's been a huge problem for us.<p>Consider for example, having two branches: ""stable"", ""master"" which have already diverged. Fixes go into ""stable"" and are regularly merged into ""master"".<p>Now imagine someone writes a fix F, which must be applied immediately to both ""stable"" and ""master"" and can't wait for the regular merge effort.<p>So with git, you just cherry-pick F into ""stable"" and ""master"".<p>Now, someone who uses ""stable"" discovers a big flaw in F, and reverts it. They assume their work will be merged into ""master"" as usual.<p>Then, a merge from ""stable"" to ""master"" happens, and the merge sees that the ""stable"" branch has 0 changes w.r.t F (commit+revert), whereas it has the F change in ""master"". Git's merge algorithm will consider this a trivial case, and <i>do the wrong thing</i>. The merge result will have the broken F application in ""master"", and there will be <i>no conflict</i> or any indication of a problem! This has been a huge problem for us.<p>So the result of this is that git forces you to either ""merge"" upstream, or ""cherry-pick"", but you really should not mix these two modes.<p>If you only use ""merge"", then the guy who merges must intimately understand everyone's changes in all cases of conflict. If he doesn't, others must help him resolve the conflicts <i>on his working directory</i>. Then, the merge result is one monolithic commit that makes understanding changes very difficult.<p>If you only use ""cherry-pick"", then you lose tracking of which changes have already been merged upstream, and which haven't. You start relying on the grep of ""git log"", which is unreliable, and you have no reliable tools to automate this. ""git cherry"" is unreliable and has plenty of false negatives/positives. Then there are of course problems with patch dependency, where you have to figure it all out on your own.<p>In short, the snapshot model is <i>very</i> problematic here. None of these problems would occur in the darcs model. Unfortunately, darcs does not scale. Whether that's inherent or not, I don't know. But if it did, I know I'd definitely prefer to use darcs in a large collaborative effort than git.",1336560903

People had no option but to repair things.<p>> <i>Studies of retail pricing indicate that, after correcting for inflation, a good pair of workmans' trousers -- jeans, in other words -- would have cost the equivalent of roughly $400 in 2001 dollars in 1901.

Furthermore, a couple months ago, the dutch FTC put major telecom providers under review for making alleged cartel price agreements.<p>On a higher level, I am certainly for a free market, but don't dismiss government regulations purely because they can 'only hinder competition'. That is a very dogmatic statement as regulations aren't always 'bad'/hindering competition. No personal offense intended, but I always find the strength of belief in a purely free market for some people to be almost the same as how other people believe in religion, very idealistic and extreme. There are a lot of subtleties and nuances to free markets. Also, is pursuing a free market a goal in itself, or a means to an end in creating a 'good society'. In the latter case, other advantages of certain regulations should be considered as well.<p>Lastly, regarding the issue at hand, next to economical arguments, I think a large part of getting this regulation has comes from other motivations such as valuing equality and accessibility for all etc.",1336560707

3947875,comment,3945760,3945760,1,0,tikhonj,,,"I can't help thinking that almost everything he lists applies <i>more</i> to Scheme than Python. Scheme also has the advantage of being much simpler, smaller, more concise, more flexible and more elegant than Python. It actually does functional programming <i>well</i> rather than half-heartedly, and is rather nice for OOP as well.<p>Additionally, Scheme has one very important property that Python lacks--there is almost no magic. Even definitions and assignments (define and set! respectively) look like normal function calls. It also makes it clear that very little is fundamental to a language--with Java and Python things like classes and control structures are special and built into the language; with Scheme they do not differ superficially from normal functions. With Java I thought classes and objects were somehow the only way to do it; Scheme clearly showed me that they do not even have to be part of the core language.<p>Now, Scheme does have some complicated ideas like macros and continuations, but there is no reason to teach those to beginners--it's an eminently useful language as is, and <i>extremely</i> simple. The very first CS course I took in college used Scheme; we spent something like just <i>two</i> lectures on the language itself. Now that the professor retired they've changed the course over to Python; I think they're still learning the language half-way through the semester.<p>Scheme is also great because, being very simple, it is much easier to implement than Python. And once you have a basic Scheme implementation, you can modify it to see other potential languages. For example, in our intro CS course, we talked about writing a memoizing interpreter and even a lazy interpreter. It's hard to imagine a lazy Python! We even reused Scheme syntax (but not really semantics) to cover logic programming  la Prolog.<p>That course was one of the most enlightening semesters I have ever spent. I really think that Scheme is the perfect introductory didactic language.",1336559257

You just have to know what you are doing, know when to give up, know how to spot a lemon and start from the right end of the problem. That is the art.<p>The main trick is to start with the broken item, not an item that you paid full price for and broke...<p>i.e. I don't mean buying a $1000 item new and when it breaks spend $200 on fixing it.<p>I mean buying a $100 broken item to start with and spending $200 fixing it, resulting in not spending that extra $700 on the new item in the first place.<p>Despite the cost of repair in cash and time, the gain usually runs in favour of your own time, satisfaction and knowledge. It also makes you less of a slave to the credit facilities which when you consider interest, results in a lot of time spend earning to pay back.<p>I will repair anything and everything rather than buy new.<p>My latest win: Sony Bravia 26EX smart OLED TV. Paid 25GBP as it was completely dead and just out of warranty. 30 mins diagnostics with a Fluke multimeter (which cost me 10GBP that I repaired) pointed to duff PSU. 30 mins on the Tektronix scope (which cost me 30GBP that I repaired) pointed to a problem with a VRM.  Replaced VRM in PSU from Farnell order (12GBP incl delivery) - was a bit fiddly as it was an SMD component. Works fine now and the kids have a nice TV.<p>Also don't buy any old consumer junk. If you can't remove the battery it's not likely to want to be repaired (yes you Apple).",1336558002

This is just the nature of the beast, the Internet being mostly decentralized.<p>And btw, when it comes to net neutrality, I don't think it's such a good idea, because I'm a firm believer in a free market and government regulations only hinder competition.<p>Net neutrality may be a solution in the U.S. where monopolies are a bigger issue and where you don't have much choice in regards to your net provider depending on location, but in Europe the competition is pretty tough.<p>For instance people criticized the net neutrality proposal pushed by Google because it exempts mobile providers, however in my country there are 3 major carriers (plus a couple of smaller ones), each of them with mostly the same network coverage, each of them with 3G data plans, each of them operating on the same standards and compatible frequencies. Also under our law, you can always interrupt a contract, the only penalty being that you have to give back the subsidized amount for the remaining period (e.g. the price of the phone minus the initial price, divided by 24 and multiplied by the number of remaining months), but if you have a contract with no subsidy, there are no penalties involved. And since you can also move your number from one carrier to another, there is absolutely no lock-in effect, other than the bureaucracy involved. Also, for locked phones, the carrier must unlock it for free once the subsidy is paid.<p>The competition is pretty though, and the PrePay plans here would make you jealous ;-) And in my area I also have not less than 3 major broadband providers which are national, so the same arguments hold for landlines.<p>In this light, in the context of cut-throat competition, yet another government regulation simply does not make sense.",1336557797

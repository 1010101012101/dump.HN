697351,comment,697186,697186,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Daring Fireball is once again right on target. I do, however, still take issue with two points:<p>1) ""Is it feasible to use Chrome OS as your sole computer?"" This question is asked, but then the arguement proceeds as if this question was answered ""no"". However, in reality, I think that this question is a definite yes for the vast majority of home users... minus iPod support... not an insurmountable problem.<p>2) The entire ""An odd name"" section. Yes, I agree that significantly different things should have significantly different names. However, Chrome OS and the Chrome browser are NOT significantly different things. That's the beauty of this. Chrome OS is a straight forward extension of Chrome the browser. It's actually a huuuuge win for Google that people don't know what a browser or an OS is. They know that ""Google Chrome"" is something that you can get on a small laptop or something that you can get on windows or something that you can get on a Mac. Who cares? The point is that people will learn that some web sites work best ""Powered by Google"" or ""With Chrome"" or WHATEVER and they will ask ""how do I get get this program?"" and just because that question has two answers (an OS or a browser) doesn't mean they have to have two different names. You walk into a store and say ""Give me Chrome"". You can get a Chrome netbook or you can get Windows with Chrome OEM installed. The sales rep will explain, in a non-technical and probably highly-incorrect form, what Chrome is, and people will buy a Chrome OS netbook or an Windows laptop with Chrome OEM-installed, and be less confused.<p><i>Technical folks can overcome the naming confusion, but non-technical folks won't even know that the naming confusion exists.</i>",1247216137

See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=define:sorting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=define:sorting</a><p>This is similar to the confusion between ""and"" and ""or"" I've seen people have when using computers to do searches.  In plain English, ""and"" is often an expansion term, in that it often expands the result set rather than restricts it, similar to ""or"".<p><pre><code>  go through that file cabinet and find 
  all records for Alice and Bob.
</code></pre>
This actually means ""give me records matching Alice or Bob"", because the name/ownership/topic field is mutually exclusive (if a record is for Alice, it can't also be for Bob), and people intuitively understand that. So it expands to ""give me (records matching Alice) and (records matching Bob)"", not ""give me records that match Bob from the set of records that match Alice"".",1247214563

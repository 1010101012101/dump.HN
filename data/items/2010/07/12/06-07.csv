Just like us, their brains would have been evolved to deal with some primary physical stuff (like falling rocks, fire, etc). So programming will be as complex to them as it is to us.<p>The complexities would have to be abstracted away, and if they were space travelling, the abstractions have to be reliable. So probably, by the time we meet them, they have some type of black-box elementary code particulars for many different functions that everyone needs to join together to produce machines.<p>Probably, they would have developed some type of inform interface method, where you can specify what you want in and out and the appropriate atomic block gets delivered to you. They would have some type of global repository that harnesses the power of many different individuals working on problems to avoid any form of repetition.<p>Currently, we interface with code through typing. This is inefficient for us, and we don't know how they will coummicate. However, for them to be capable of abstract though, they will need to create pictures in their mind. It does not seem farfetched to assume that they have much faster interfacing methods that work directly on pictures they visualise. This allows them join the atomic blocks much quicker.<p>In effect, they will try to eliminate the manual work entirely, and only do the specifications part of things (tell it what you want), and let the computer build the rest of the things.<p>On the other hand, perhaps they lack our sense of moral, and will work with biological computers, and not metal-based.",1278917505

1507039,comment,1506953,1506953,0,0,derefr,,,"Speaking as a sci-fi author, who thinks about this quite a bit: there will be more <i>kinds</i> of programming, but it'll all pretty much resemble what we already have. It will be faster and easier, and use (or ""waste"", depending on your perspective) lots more resources. It would be completely predicated on the technology, not in ""alien thinking""; if given a tutorial, humans could easily program the alien computers the same way the aliens could, after struggling with concepts that are about equivalently difficult to recursion or pointer arithmetic.<p>The kind of programs we know today (encoding static text segments using a tower of abstractions and compilers) would still continue to exist. What we today call ""programming"" as a whole, will be what aliens call ""embedded programming""—the kind you do under severe resource-constraints, where every gate must be secure, reliable, and could be hit with hard radiation at any time. We'd easily be able to understand these programs, given an appropriate disassembler. They would likely be written mostly by constraint-solving AIs, however, not tediously by aliens, who have better things to do. Aliens would, however, check them over out of paranoia/""defense-in-depth."" They would be intensely parallel: imagine how NASA shuttle software works, with several independently-contracted codebases on independent hardware voting on each decision—but multiply the scales a millionfold.<p>Most programs, however, would not be ""embedded""; they could expect to rely on a ""silly"" amount of resources. They would be inscrutable, mostly JIT-genetically-evolved from small ""goal scripts"" (which themselves would still, indeed, resemble human source code—clear and exact communication of rules and intent within a business domain survives no matter the language used.) They would rely on a ""universal library"" of ""common sense"", both in process knowledge (algorithms, protocols) and semantic knowledge (datatypes, fixtures, ""facts"" in the RDF sense) that would allow programmers to actually write ""Do What I Mean"" programs as well as could ever be achieved.<p>There would only be a single ""programming language"", for the same reason that we, today, have a Unicode character encoding. All programs would be <i>internally</i> stored in something resembling S-expressions (just a binary-encoded tree), and represented, textually or graphically (or audially or kinesthetically or experientially or somatically or telepathically...) through a bijective transformation. Every identifier in a program would be a universally-unique resource-locating ID (i.e. something that is both a UUID and a URL) allowing for importing of live code from external (network) libraries, cross-program optimization and symbolic unification, global API versioning, and removal of all ""name clashes.""<p>Also, a bonus sociological perspective: there would be living software—like with carbon-based life, we would classify software into ""plants"" (natural resources that we care about mostly as an enabler), ""animals"" (feeling but unthinking goal-directed objects that we think should have some, but not all, the rights of sentients) and ""people"" (which would have just the same rights bio-people do.) ""Animal"" software would have control systems that mimic (or simply <i>are</i>) emotions; an alien Roomba would indeed be considered a pet. But in the converse view, the aliens would consider genetically programming carbon-based plants and animals to have symbiotic functions, just as we currently live in symbiosis with robots and machines. They might all be ultra-vegans, for the simple reason that any combination of flavor, texture, and nutritional content could be turned into the fruit of a plant (a symbiotic arrangement), and so would abhor the non-symbiosis with which we consume our own environment.",1278916416

Public education is all about obedience and stifles creativity, teaches children that they should follow orders rather than set their own objectives, passes off clearly incorrect propaganda as history, and neglects important life skills like personal finance and goal-setting in favor of learning archaic and useless facts. A main function of public education is the role of baby-sitting and instilling obedience and loyalty to the current government. Cutting this system returns the responsibility of educating children to the people who care the most and have the least conflicting interests with the children - their parents.",1278915565

Its software technology, therefore, must be similarly antique. Obviously nothing like it exists on earth - though those of us who remember VMS might be deceived...<p>...Since Earth code is fifty years old, and Martian code is fifty million years old, Martian code has been evolving into a big ball of mud for a million times longer than Earth software. (And two million times longer than Windows...)<p>...There is only one thing to do with it: obliterate the trunk, fire the developers, and hire a whole new fscking army of Martian code-monkeys to rewrite the entire fscking thing.<p>This is such an obvious and essential response to the big ball of mud pattern that, despite the fact that we know nothing about Mars, we can deduce that it must have happened on Mars. Probably several times. Probably several hundred. For each of these attempts but the last, of course, the result was either (a) abject failure, (b) another big ball of mud, or (c) both.<p>But the last, by definition, succeeded. This is the crucial inference we can draw about Mars: since the Martians had 50 million years to try, in the end they must have succeeded. The result: Martian code, as we know it today.

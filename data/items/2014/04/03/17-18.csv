Get an SSD and a bit more ram and Eclipse is very fast - even startup is very quick for me. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to buy an SSD than it is to spend hours looking for another solution when the current one works fine. I don&#x27;t have any pauses anymore.",1396547962

Like you said, proactive status updates, even if it&#x27;s about delays, put customer minds at ease. \nThe status tracker could also drive traffic to other informative parts of the site. For instance, you&#x27;re mattresses are American made. If you source materials from a specific place, outlining where a customer&#x27;s mattress is coming from could be cool. If you source from multiple American companies and manufacture in multiple locations, a customer could track where their mattress is coming from.

If you are in a circumstance where you want to divide to solve an equation, you <i>must</i> check to make sure you&#x27;re not dividing by zero (and write a special case for any circumstance in which you might otherwise have divided by zero.)<p>> &quot;Solve for f(x) in the following equation (x + 2) * f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4, where x = -2.&quot;<p>The way you&#x27;ve written it, f(x) is undefined for x=-2.  Any value I select for f(2) makes that expression true.  Try it -- if f(2)=813, 0 * 813 = 4-8+4.  That solution works.<p>You might prefer to define f(2)=0 because it makes f(x) continuous.  But you have to <i>define</i> that value separately; you can&#x27;t <i>solve</i> for it from the equation, because dividing by (x+2) is not a valid operation for x=-2.  You could, alternatively, choose to define f(2)=7 or f(2)=-318 or any other value.  Because you&#x27;ve written an equation that allows it.<p>That&#x27;s the thing about mathematics.  It&#x27;s very carefully defined and very precise.  Your inclination is to try to simplify first, but you&#x27;re simplifying in a way that is <i>not valid</i> for x=-2 and thereby accidentally making an incorrect statement (that f(2) &quot;should&quot; be zero.)  If you simplify properly, you&#x27;ll see what ubercow said is true -- the solution is f(x)=x+2 except at x=-2, where f(-2) can be any number and therefore you have a continuum of possible solutions.",1396547302

I have worked with  a few local developers I would call mature professionals: If I was starting a startup, I know where I&#x27;d call. But I only know their skillset through having worked with them over the years. How can someone that doesn&#x27;t have a network find them?<p>A few you can find in user groups and meetups. But that gets you one very specific brand of mature developers. Many in my list wouldn&#x27;t go to one of those: They are often just sausagefests, with 25 to 35 year old males trying to impress others about how good they are. That and recruiters who tend to not know anything. Same thing by going with speakers in conferences: You get a few people, but those are probably not going to make your company their number one priority. It&#x27;s more likely that you are an excuse to make money between other engagements.<p>An ad in a recruiting site? The really good ones don&#x27;t get jobs like that: They mention a friend they are unhappy in their workplace, and they quickly get recruited. I got my last job like that, without even an interview. So and so says you are great and would mesh very well here, so have an offer.<p>Pestering recruiters? You can talk to those, but they can&#x27;t tell the good from the bad. Also, the mature professional can&#x27;t tell if your newfangled startup is good or bad. Will you want insane hours? Do you have a crazy idea, like mandating that all code is organized in tiny web services 100 lines of Clojure or less? Unless they are unhappy in their existing position, you have to find them and prove to them that you are  a worthy employment option. And they might not even buy into your pitch. No, They might think that a web of tiny services doesn&#x27;t really fix all the world&#x27;s problems, or they might not want to do boring business analytics.<p>So, more than the scarcity of professionals, the real problem is that you can&#x27;t even contact them.",1396547251

For example, if you create an ANAME record with “Europe”\n  as the GTD region, then only resolving name servers in Europe would be used\n  to create the A records for this new record type. This ensures that your\n  traffic continues to be routed regionally as planned with your worldwide\n  infrastructure. Use of ANAME records are fully compatible with GTD service\n  and optimize use of a CDN provider. This provides the complete power\n  and flexibility that enterprise companies require from their networks today.</code></pre>",1396546923

7524502,comment,7522517,7523813,3,0,chc,,,"The picture you seem to be drawing of ghettos doesn&#x27;t much resemble American ghettos as I know them.<p>American ghettos are not places where unemployed people have all their needs provided for them and live in carefree leisure. Ghettos are places where society&#x27;s traditional support structures have failed and, in order to stay afloat, a significant portion of the populace has turned to jobs so heinous and net-negative to society that they would be repellent in any other context. They&#x27;re some of the first victims of the &quot;bad jobs&quot; that Stross warned in the OP that people would be forced to take in the face of poor employment prospects. Ghettos are a prime example of the harm that comes from our dependence on conditional money to live.<p>As a counterexample, retirement communities are generally much nicer than ghettos — even though gainful employment in those communities is even lower than in ghettos. This is because the people in retirement communities aren&#x27;t desperate. They don&#x27;t have infinite money, but they generally don&#x27;t need to worry too much about money. So what do these people do when they are relieved of the need to work for a living? Oh, they work on personal projects and put an increased emphasis on family, friends and community.<p>I do think you&#x27;re bringing up an important point. Most people haven&#x27;t considered the social implications well enough, and there is a somewhat unsupported assumption that it would go smoothly. But I don&#x27;t think ghettos are all the relevant, because financial independence is very much not the big problem there. And I also think you&#x27;re glossing over the point that the employment crisis Stross mentions in the OP will cause major societal changes whether or not we institute a basic income — I just think the changes will look a lot more like a ghetto and less like a retirement community if we <i>don&#x27;t</i> have something like a basic income in place.",1396546415

Think of detecting outliers on a square wave, or a pinched sine wave, or any &quot;non-pure&quot; tone, really... Non-gaussian noise/interference is also way more common than you would be lead to believe :). Onset detection is a complex problem, but an easy to understand solution is a tunable lag-lead moving average filter.<p>One small window calculates the moving average, while a larger window also calculates the moving average. For &quot;noise&quot; or typical data, the averages should be similar given that both windows encompass more than a few cycles of the signal. When the small window average is > than the large window average by some margin, an event has just occurred. The two windows should then get to about the same average for the event duration (in this case, there is not really much duration). Once the small window average is < the large window average by some margin, then the signal event is over. There are better approaches from music information retrieval which use phase information as well...<p>The hard part is tuning the &quot;above and below&quot; thresholds and two window sizes from the signal you wish to catch - this approach is used as a simple alternative to wavelets for earthquake detection.<p>Great illustration, and if this technique works for your data that is awesome!

That&#x27;s why he went to SAC for a quick sanity check.<p><i>But as he talked to Wall Street investors, he came to realize that they were dealing with the same problem. He had a good friend who traded stocks at a big-time hedge fund in Stamford, Conn., called SAC Capital, which was famous (and soon to be infamous) for being one step ahead of the U.S. stock market. If anyone was going to know something about the market that Katsuyama didn’t know, he figured, it would be someone there. One spring morning, he took the train up to Stamford and spent the day watching his friend trade. Right away he saw that, even though his friend was using software supplied to him by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and the other big firms, he was experiencing exactly the same problem as RBC: He would hit a button to buy or sell a stock, and the market would move away from him. “When I see this guy trading, and he was getting screwed — I now see that it isn’t just me. My frustration is the market’s frustration. And I was like, ‘Whoa, this is serious.’ ”</i><p>This dispels (according to the story) the notion that it was a firm specific or SW specific issue.  Of course you could assume this is fabricated (for convenience). But the next step is harder to fabricate:<p><i>He hired Rob Park, a gifted technologist, to explain to him what actually happened inside all these new Wall Street black boxes, and together they set out to assemble a team to investigate the U.S. stock market. Once he had a team in place, Katsuyama persuaded his superiors at RBC to conduct what amounted to a series of experiments. For the next several months, he and his people would trade stocks not to make money but to test theories. RBC agreed to let his team lose up to $10,000 a day to figure out why the market in any given stock vanished the moment RBC tried to trade in it. Katsuyama asked Park to come up with some theories.</i><p>This could easily be verified independent of Katsuyama (eg, by talking to either the other principals and/or 3rd parties as RBC management). What is important, however, it it is orthogonal to anecdote. And by putting capital at risk and testing ex-ante theories, not only are they getting on firmer epistemic grounds, but they are leaving paper trails internally and externally.<p><i>As they worked through the order types, the Puzzle Masters created a taxonomy of predatory behavior in the stock market. Broadly speaking, it appeared as if there were three activities that led to a vast amount of grotesquely unfair trading.</i><p>Of course you could object to this as &quot;fabrication&quot;. But there is evidence that they tested SW products to defeat these various strategies. These products were later bought and then spun out and backed by third party customers & investors.<p>Again, this could all be fabricated. But you would need elaborate conspiracy theories to explain the lack of due dilligence by the investors (not to mention Lewis).",1396545176

It&#x27;s important for me that she has a very safe and welcoming environment to get excited about coding - since this will be her introduction to it. I feel like having 15-16 year old boys in the program would be very distracting and counterproductive for her.<p>All completely reasonable points, and your choices also seem reasonable. But let me ask when, if ever, your sister will be able to leave that sequestered environment and enter the real world. Isn&#x27;t it our goal to take down these barriers and achieve gender equality?<p>Gender equality doesn&#x27;t mean two colonies, one of men and another of women. It means one society composed of men and women. Or am I wrong about that?<p>> I mostly go to the women who code meetups because I can learn in a safe space that I personally enjoy.<p>Yes, understood. That&#x27;s why men go to meetings where only men are present -- same reasoning, same outcome.<p>> In meetups where there are only women, we get to actually learn and support each other, and it&#x27;s great. I want the same environment for my sister to learn in.<p>I know a secret that I&#x27;m going to reveal to you -- that works for men too. But it has the unfortunate side effect of making men intolerant of the presence of women. Do you want that outcome for women?<p>I ask this in all sincerity, without judgment or rancor -- do you want a society in which men and women pay attention only to their own instincts and needs, and make no effort to construct a society composed of both men and women?",1396544747

If arbitrageurs cannot profit by breaking your trade up into two trades with themselves as middleman, it doesn&#x27;t matter how fast they are.<p>Aside from that, any system where trades can occur faster than information can enter your eyeball, process in the brain, and shoot down your arm to click a mouse button is one that unfairly disadvantages the unaugmented human participant.",1396544467

For many things, I&#x27;m a fan.<p>However, SQL query construction and result munging is painful.<p>Consider a UI search screen that has eight potential search parameters that requires a one to many join for the results. The query construction, under something like JDBC, can end up with hundreds of lines of tedious code, like (and this is a condensed example!):<p><pre><code>    String query = &quot;SELECT a.*, b.* from table1 a inner join table2 b on a.fk_id = b.id where&quot; // shorthand\n    List whereClauses = []\n    if (params.region) { whereClauses.add(getRegionWhereClause(params.region)) } //hope this doesn&#x27;t require another join!)\n    if (params.country) { whereClauses.add(getCountryWhereClause(params.country)) }\n    ...\n    if (params.lastParam) { whereClauses.add(getLastParamWhereClause(params.lastParam))} \n    query += whereClauses.join (&quot; AND &quot;)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nEach of the params methods are going to have a few lines of code.<p><pre><code>    def getRegionWhereClause(regionCodeList) { &quot;a.region IN&quot; } //Hope you never want to change the table alias here!\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/obfuscation/smart-logic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/obfuscation/s...</a> shows why using an ISNULL/NVL hackaround for static queries is the wrong answer.<p>Then you&#x27;re going to return a list of rows that looks like\n    | a.1 | a.2 | b.1  | b.2  |\n    | a.1 | a.2 | b.1&#x27; | b.2&#x27; |<p>Where you really want:\n    | a.1 | a.2 | [[b.1 | b.2] | [b.1&#x27; | b.2&#x27;]]<p>So you have to go through and munge it. (Can you use something like CONCAT as a hack and groupby? Sure, but that introduces other problems.)<p>Having a way to pass in optional parameters to a where clause for the DB to strip out (while staying performant) and being able to return a 1 to many as an array would solve many problems, but it doesn&#x27;t fit the paradigm of SQL.",1396544414

Marijuana is legal at the state level but not federally.  These merchants have a hard time using the banking and credit card systems and transacting in BTC would help them do e-commerce.<p>The second is very low denomination transactions (like 10c).  It may become profitable for compensate people at scale for doing some very small amount of work.  Like giving someone who finds a typo some small amount of compensation.  Credit cards are very poor for this.<p>As for replacing CC, that is a tall order.  They are expensive and inefficient, but accepting credit cards does increase top line revenue if a merchant accepts them.  If a payment method is going to get adoption it needs to grow revenue (vs. reduce cost) for a merchant if the merchant accepts it.",1396544403

I seem to have some kind of horribly mistaken impression that I'm doing a good job when the code is more readable, more modular, more functional, and more <i>succinct</i>, all at the same time.  I guess you must know something I don't.",1201514352
105454,comment,105444,105444,0,0,Leon,,,"A lot of the big users of social media seem to view it as some type of game - who can get the most karma, votes, diggs, etc.  That's not to say they are the most wanted users, but usually the most prolific.<p>The best users of social media have always looked like the ones who are just showing something 'cool' that they have done or understand that involvement in the social platform can bring great benefits back in the form of an active community.<p>At least that's what my guess is.",1201514289
105452,comment,105444,105444,0,0,rms,,,"It's a positive type of social interaction that is different than real world interactions. For me, it's a way of feeling more connected to a culture that does not exist in Pittsburgh.<p>I contribute to news.yc because I find it more entertaining than TV or video games. I should really pick up Rock Band though, that could get me to quit news.yc for a couple days.",1201514138

The better YC topics and discussions have a Socratic feel I don't generally encounter in other places.",1201513930

And if they are not, have them take some math classes or teach them about project management :)",1201513152

Sure, lots of startups don't have advisory boards, but what's the harm in having stock-holding advisors?",1201512614

Is it the feeling of charity, or something more personal, or do these users (who submit and filter content) expect others to return the favor?",1201512344

Essentially I've been given small amounts of company stock just for my PR value + occasionally helping the company out.   In the one case where I really help a company out I was a paid consultant and not an 'advisor'.",1201512139

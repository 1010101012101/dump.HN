2520903,comment,2516940,2518576,1,0,geebee,,,"Thanks for your reply...<p>I'm kind of following you - unfortunately, I don't know ruby well enough to understand what you mean when you say class declarations are loaded as constants at run time, but I'll definitely look into it.<p>I think there's a third purpose to DI that you didn't mention.  The container does instantiate an object and inject it (""wire it"") into another object, but the real benefit is that you can externally configure which object to swap in.  That last part might matter less in a language that doesn't have to be compiled but it can still be valuable if you have a lot of different implementations that need to be swapped in/out in different deployments.<p>The method you described for person - testing a conditional - do you mean you'd create a method with a conditional, and choose which implementation to use based on that conditional?  I've done this, and it certainly works, but it isn't really a placement for DI (this sounds more like a factory method, though again I don't think that those really exist to the same extent in ruby since duck typing is much more flexible than static typing).  My problem with this approach (if I understand it right, which I'm not sure I do) is that this would lead to a very long series of conditionals to load the right class.  In rails, I'd probably be looking to pull them out into a yaml file (something like the applicationContext file in Spring).",1304689853

2520832,comment,2516913,2518666,1,0,anatoly,,,"> This is a pretty big stretch. The Russian language defines 3 tiers of familiarity/address: a nickname for family/friends, a full first name for acquaintances of the same age, and a full first + patronymic name for everyone else. (This is similar to a French person being offended by an overly familiar ""Tu"" when a ""Vous"" is appropriate). Moreover, it is not uncommon anywhere to use a nickname in correspondence with friends and colleagues and a full name in more formal situations.<p>Perelman signed his _papers_ ""Grisha Perelman"". That's about as formal an occasion for a mathematician as it gets. The paper is the claim for posterity. It's what the next generations of mathematicians will read. It's not impossible to imagine a mathematician who'd sign his mathematical papers as ""Bob Green"", but then be strongly offended by being so identified in the media, but it's very, very unlikely.<p>Also, ""Grisha"" is no more a nickname than ""Bob"" or ""Bill"" (that is, they all can be considered nicknames, but aren't usually what we mean by a nickname in its more common sense). They're familiar forms. It's not unheard of for a Russian scientist to adopt their familiar form as the preferential first name, even in formal situations, in English-language cultures. E.g. Misha Verbitsky, Sasha Razborov... you can easily google many more examples.<p>Obviously I disagree with you about the first link grasping at straws. In particular, mekhmat vs matmekh alone is damning. This difference between the names of the two most prestigious math departments in Moscow vs St. Petersburg is legendary. It's next to impossible for an alumnus of mekhmat to refer to his alma mater as matmekh or vice versa.<p>> Apparently, the Israeli paper was able to find the interviewer... not particularly surprising given that he had moved to Israel in the 90's.<p>They didn't find him in the sense that they weren't able to contact him, as they explain; I didn't mean to claim that the name or the person were nonexistent.",1304687887

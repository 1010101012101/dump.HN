3144651,comment,3144391,3144391,13,0,k33n,,,"Sounds like you shouldn't be using Rails if this is your philosophy. I'm of the school of thought that if you're going to use a framework when building an app, then you should lean on it for just about any task that it will let you. Especially if you're using a well-maintained and widely used framework like Rails. There are multiple benefits to this approach. For one thing, it makes it easier to onboard new team members. There are tons of people who are Rails experts, and are very familiar with its paradigms and features. People like this can very quickly get up to speed with just about any Rails project. A large team can also communicate and work much more efficiently if they are all using the same code structure/helpers/etc. If you're a one man show, it might work just fine for you to build specialized gems for all of your ""application"" (though the line you've drawn between application and framework seems pretty vague) though there is going to be a fundamental lack of structure to your entire project. It'll make sense to you for a little while until it gets so big that even you don't understand it. It's going to be difficult to perceive test coverage, and in practice, all those little gems are going to vary pretty wildly in structure.<p>You'd be better off just using Sinatra and including ActiveRecord, and whatever other Rails libraries you want to use.",1319327217

Removal of territorial borders as the basis for what constitutes a ""State"" and allowing a free market in decentralized legal systems to arise, under controlled conditions that provide rules and means for these budding governments to interact and cooperate with each other within a larger scope of law, is the only way any stable form of anarchism could ever occur.<p>tl;dr As an AnCap, I support a federalized breed of constitional clan politics, NOT Rent-A-Cops and Kangaroo Courts.",1319327158

While there's no doubt that he'll do many things differently, you can pretty much guarantee it's not going to be anything on the order of the massive purges Apple experienced in the late 90s. Apple in 1997 was mortibund; almost nobody thought Jobs had a serious chance at turning it around.<p>Schmidt successfully did for Page and Brin what John Sculley was supposed to do for Jobs; provide guidance for an inexperienced founder until they can assume the chief executive role.<p>And while I agree with much of what you wrote, I take exception to the idea that, outside of search, Google 'doesn't do anything particularly well'. They have a range of excellent and successful products, most of them well integrated into their core business.

Since earning an anomalously high income is -- obviously -- itself anomalous, it stands to reason that a high percentage of the highest incomes were due to one-shot gains, whether from cashing in on options in a company after an IPO or a vesting, making a huge trade in the market that pans out impossibly well, or simply making the deal of a lifetime in a business arrangement.<p>Any disagreements? Other possible explanations? This is pretty interesting macroeconomic data, so I'd love to hear more thoughts.",1319325500

One dinner with Goldman people in Moscow and voila!?! The article provides a decent biographical sketch but the author is left to speculate on all the whys. I wonder whether he asked tough questions and was simply rebuffed or whether YM provided access but laid strict ground rules.

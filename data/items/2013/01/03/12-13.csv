5002120,comment,5002006,5002113,30,0,FooBarWidget,,,"> The author wastes a lot of breath refuting claims that this is a huge Ruby bug<p>Get your facts right first. It's not a Ruby bug. It's a Rails bug. Ruby != Rails.<p>Many words are used to explain how it works. That is not a refute, nowhere did I claim the bug does not exist. But the requirement for specific circumstances is a fact.<p>The Python pickle example is not only totally irrelevant, it is also not a security vulnerability. Pickle does exactly what it is supposed to do. You weren't supposed to unpickle arbitrary untrusted data in the first place. If you require a safer alternative, use JSON or something, but don't expect as many features as pickle provides.<p>In the end, whether this is a ""bug"" or a ""huge bug"" is left as an opinion. The article provides hard facts, and a little bit of commentary. Fact is, we've written a ton of Rails apps that all use find_by_* quite extensively but none turned out to be vulnerable because the case where 'foo' is a symbol hash is rare. Whether you think this is an excuse or not, I'll let you decide.",1357217899

The government is nothing but an employee of the collective and - ideally - everyone agrees with its goals at least so much that they pay the taxes thought to be necessary to accomplish them.<p>Background: I'm Swiss and this is more or less how the relationship between government and people works here. Besides the people's right to take down / create any law collectively, the tax system also works in a way that tax evasions are not regarded as illegal the same way you do. People are obligated to 'list their stuff' every year - if it turns out they 'forgot' something, it is simply paid later - only some minor monetary punishment involved, never jailtime. It only becomes a crime if someone forges documents - which is hardly ever done. The banking secrecy plays a big role in this - it's basically the Swiss government saying 'we will never directly look into your books and trust the informations you give us'. It's the behavior of a subordinate who trusts that he's fairly compensated by his employer.<p>Interestingly, Swiss tax moral is said to be very high, despite this lax system.",1357216832

5002043,comment,5001308,5001893,1,0,vidarh,,,"Yes, sounds similar. On the Amiga, all screens can have a backdrop window + floating windows. The backdrop is <i>usually</i> provided by the app that opens the screen, but not always. On public screens you'd usually only use floating windows, but there's no real reason why you couldn't ut backdrop windows there too. No tiling support, though.<p>I was actually planning on installing dwm or another tiling window manager until I had Ubuntu 12.04 installed on my new laptop and decided it was nice enough that I'd try it for a while, and I've stayed with it because enough of the apps I use on it handles very well to strip various chrome when maximized, and most of them are nicely integrated with the new global menu bar.<p>I do use alt-F11 or equivalent for many apps sometimes, but I find it's poorly tuneable for too many apps. E.g. sometimes I want <i>some</i> chrome, like tabs or location bar for a browser visible but nothing else, but the full screen modes for many apps are more ""presentation modes"" (Chrome on OS-X at least interestingly separates ""full screen"" and ""presentation mode"" - few apps do that)<p>It's definitively a way of working that came about due to small screens  or low resolutions (the default Workbench screen on the Amiga was 640x256 for PAL and 640x200 for NTSC... 640x512 or 640x400 if you could stand the flicker of an interlaced display...), and that makes more difference on small screens, but these days I tend to use it for larger screens too.<p>Though on larger screens I do sometimes think I'd like a tiling WM again (I used to use Ion way back), so I might just give it a shot. I wonder if any of the tiling WMs would integrate ok with Dash and the global menu bar in Ubuntu, as I actually really like those parts, though...

However I don't think gerrymandering is the cause of the problems you mention - partisanship, corruption, and party power. When there are problems, it's easy to pick some popular target to take the blame. The root of the problem is the primary system, which is only attended by the most partisan. An open primary reduces significantly all of these factors. Parties must attempt to carefully support two candidates, and lose control of who can run and vote in the nominating process. Special interests can be weakened since introducing a primary challenger no longer means the candidate loses the general. Partisanship is caused by the candidates appealing to the base, who tend to vote strongly in primaries. If it's possible to come in second in the primary with the support of more moderate voters, then still win the election, more moderates will win overall.<p>Fixing gerrymandering alone will not solve these issues, and has the potential to make policy erratic and electoral choices too stark. Reasonable districting along with open primaries could go a long way toward ameliorating these issues.<p>Interesting discussion.",1357216245

I found the miles usage for road signs in London odd, as well as the usage for pounds for vegetables in Canada.<p>Road distances & speeds : kilometres\nFood measurements are always grams/kilograms & mls and litres ... except for steak & there are some hold hovers like soft drinks which are often in 330ml/600/680ml, 1.25litre, 2 litre. Milk is always litres and not just a straight conversion from ounces to litres, so always 1/2/4 litres. In addition, I think supermarkets are required to list food prices with a price/unit, e.g. $2/kg so that you can easily compare prices between brands/varieties.<p>Hardware supplies are in metres or dual listed.<p>Weight is always done in kilograms although older people occasionally will use stones / pounds (which usually requires clarification). Haven't heard them in quite a while.<p>Engine power is measured in terms of kilowatts. For some odd reason we have an odd unit for fuel efficiency of litres/100km. Not sure who picked this. E.g. 8.5 L /100km.<p>TVs are sometimes dual although mostly I'll see them in terms of centimetres although computer monitors are still in inches, probably due to the US.<p>I think when purchasing land it's a bit of mix as you can buy land in hectares as well as acres. There's also squares which I gather is 10ft by 10ft (which is odd and everyone I know silently guesses is around 9.something metres^2).<p>Not much into sports but pretty sure they use metres there too for Australian Football.",1357214786

I believe they had something like 2 months of available cash. And their stock was in the single digits. He shut a lot of things down; if you weren't making money (ATG, Newton, and the consumer products) you were gone. He also cut off charity and left it to Cook to re-implement it.<p>This is why I believe Apple are holding onto so much cash. Far easier to ask banks for million dollar loans when you have billions in savings rather than begging private equity who'll strip you to pieces.",1357214770

It's a bit confusing because it sets you up defaults for both day and week where week=7xDay, but it doesn't have to be that way.",1357214680

OWS (possibly not every instance) was doing this when they were removed by pepper spray and bulldozers. There was at least one incident where an individual was hospitalized after being hit in the head by a ballistic tear gas or smoke canister. He was not attended to by the police who injured him.

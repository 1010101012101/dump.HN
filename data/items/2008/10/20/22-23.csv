If all the circuitry was surrounded by tinfoil and the cable had better shielding, it'd probably cut the radiation a lot.  If anything, i'd bet its the cable that does all the radiating?

At $5-$10 each, well, it might be a dumb idea, I'm not sure.  Average customer gets me $10/month or so in revenue.<p>See, I was thinking that my target market (cheap Linux hobbyists and cheap micro-businesses)  might actually wear free shirts.    I would think the value of the schwag as advertising directly correlates to how much it is used in public by the recipient.<p>The thing is, as I'm self funded, the credit crunch doesn't mean anything, so long as I keep my consulting gigs.  I'm buying hardware right now like it was 1999.  This next month, after I get my new capacity up, I am going to need to spend some money on advertising.<p>I do ok for the relevant google searches, and my target market is very technical (yes, I could vastly expand my market by making it easier.   I'm working on it, but my core customer base is people like me-  people who don't click on ads.) so I don't think buying 'sponsored results' from google will make much difference.",1224542822
338409,comment,338309,338309,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"From my understanding (and the graphs don't disprove it, aside from the Doubleclick bounce), Google has been in ""slow hire"" mode for over a year.  The feeling I get from folks within is that GOOG got a bit bloated in the middle management tier, had gotten uncomfortably hierarchical, and they would not be hiring to replace a large number of positions (no layoffs...just fewer hires to fill ""holes"" left by people leaving).<p>I don't think the economy has a lot to do with it--Google still has tons of cash, revenues are strong, and growth is apparently still happening.  I think it's just that they grew too fast to hire as carefully or selectively as prudence requires, they recognized the problem, and took steps to correct it.  (I think some of the steps are probably counter-productive.  A lot of the early hires that built Google into what it is, wouldn't be able to get an interview with Google today, because they didn't go to the right schools or have a 4.0 GPA.)",1224542759

The right-hand side of the workstations diagram was mostly replaced by Windows NT - some exceptions in artsy professions which use macs (probably by a similar proportion to those that did before 1996). A combination of Windows and free unix have replaced the other side.<p>Apple's focus and new success has been at and among home users, and things like iTunes and iWork. If they had been focussed on what was once the 'workstation' area we'd have seen far more emphasis on their proven development technologies and collaborative workplace technologies. WebObjects has survived, but it was looking dubious for years. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that there was still more OpenStep deployed on traders' desks than OSX.",1224542677

I've been a lurker here for a while and thought I might chime in.<p>Feel free to have a look at the site. Right now it's sort of a rough prototype of the idea we've been playing with. What we wanted to do is create a network that allows people to promote their own ad network by combining all of their web spaces together. A new way to create a personal brand, promote a cause, or fund an event. It's a portable ad widget that works through fixed sponsorships.<p>I'd like to know what questions you guys might have, and what you think. Feel free to rip it apart and leave nasty comments too.

338387,comment,337717,337717,0,0,mkn,,,"The meta-point for me is that SQL is just broken, as are its many implementations. We'd never tolerate a scripting language that made you learn all the implementation details before you were effective with it. And yet we tolerate this from database engines and the languages we use to interact with them.<p>The opposite end of the spectrum is modern compilers. C/C++ compilers are generally so good that most attempts at nuanced optimization are just pointless; The compiler saw you coming and optimized your code behind your back before you got there. Why can't storage engines be like this? Why do you have to think not only about the type of your data, but how you want it implemented as well? Are there technical reasons why a db can't take generic data declarations ('string' instead of 'varchar(255)') and do the right thing with it when you populate your db? Or treat the use of a transaction as a hint that you'd like a storage engine that supports transactions?<p>I realize there comes a point where the db design has to be clamped down for production, but in the design stages there's a lot of optimization that a 'SQL compiler' could do behind your back. It currently seems like database product designers have taken the lazy way out and decided that optimization should live in the developers' heads rather than in the engine.<p>It just seems like SQL is this awful holdover from the days of COBOL and that we seriously need a modern product that let's us think about our programming problems rather than SQL's hangups. Am I missing something really basic, here?<p>Let me emphasize that, afaik, ronaldbradford knows his stuff, and I'm glad for him if he can make a living off of his MySQL knowledge. I just wish that that knowledge was embedded in the products themselves.",1224541168

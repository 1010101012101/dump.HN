Does this illustrate why this could be a channel to disrupt the spirit of open source software?<p>Imagine Github does implement this. Now you have a bunch of coders who want to work on ""open source"" projects for money, hoping to get backers as if they did a Kickstarter project. Or maybe it could start an OSS Github ""gold rush.""<p>Now that we have a bunch of money-hungry developers, it'd be pretty easy to de-rail or commandeer projects simply by donating a large portion of money. Now imagine a non OSS competitor starts contributing. Multiple things can happen:<p>1) Any innovation or development of features could be easily copied and incorporated into competitive projects for sale.<p>2) A developer gets ""hooked"" on that donation money and starts favoring the large donors' requests over others.<p>3) These requests could sabotage the quality or the focus of the project.<p>4) The donor could pull funding at this point and collapse development and support of the project.<p>Full blown conspiracies aside, the whole point of OSS was to open up development for everyone to grow and learn, and to remove software development from the corruptible influence of money.<p>I think others on this thread had a great idea, make it a ""tip"", and make it anonymous. We would still have to limit ""tips"" because anyone can make a huge tip and then e-mail a ""ransom"" letter to the developers to do stuff if they want to continue getting large tips. The previous ordered list applies here.<p>Again, I'm going to an extreme and likely this sort of abuse wouldn't be rampant in a system like that. But involving money at all directly into the process sounds like it could do more harm than good.<p>If you want to take donations, you can do a Kickstarter to get up and running and then take some sort of ""beer"" or micropayment service on your website.

1) It is better to avoid problems then hit them / solve them.  Understanding where other people have failed is very valuable. Of course there is diminishing returns to this type of information and of course you are not going to avoid every potential problem. The point is to avoid the common pitfalls that many new enterprises tend to make.  If your MO is run fast into next problem -> solve problem -> run fast into next problem, your startup is probably going to fail.<p>2) Sometimes you haven't even framed the problem yet. Maybe you are still exploring the idea space, trying to figure out what is valuable or not.  Getting broad exposure to other ideas and technologies may help you crystalize what your venture is going to focus on.  And of course there is diminishing returns here too, usual analysis paralysis warnings, etc.  But a little bit of exposure every day to subjects you are not familiar with may just spark that creative bolt.",1342097361

4234222,comment,4234117,4234117,17,0,Smerity,,,"The introduction of list comprehensions is nice and should replace numerous functions. For example, I'm not sure why they're adding the array_column function into PHP 5.5 at the same time as list comprehensions as:<p><pre><code>  $names = array_column($users, 'name');
  // is the same as
  $names = [foreach ($users as $user) yield $user['name']];
</code></pre>
The only possible reason would be due to a significant speed difference, but I'd suggest improving the efficiency of the list comprehension system (even if just for common cases) than adding more functions.<p>As opposed to the introduction of list comprehensions, I can't say I like the solution for parameter skipping though... I disagree with the author -- many optional arguments is not a problem, but only if keyword arguments or a similar style are used. Consider the example they give:<p><pre><code>  // This create query function in PHP
  create_query(""deleted=0"", ""name"", default, default, false);
  // could be represented like this with keyword arguments
  create_query(""deleted=0"", ""name"", escape_arguments=false)
</code></pre>
I tend to find keyword arguments serve the purpose of self documentation as well -- I still have no clue what the false flag would be for the PHP create_query statement.<p>Keyword arguments and many optional arguments can allow for beautiful and flexible functions, such as the Python Requests library[1].<p><pre><code>  r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/xyz')
  # or we could add a few more complications
  # -- no ""defaults"" in sight and also self documenting
  r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/xyz',
    auth=('user', 'pass'), timeout=0.5, allow_redirects=True)

4234220,comment,4233505,4233505,5,0,drostie,,,"One key way in which the article is right on-the-money, so to speak, is to highlight the ridiculous frenzy that we go into to save disproportionately small amounts of money.<p>Our audience here is mostly programmers. Programmers should all know the golden rule of optimization: <i>profile it first</i>. Don't take it on intuition or faith that ""this is what was slowing me down"" unless you've measured it. The same principle applies in personal finance. Group together your expenses into some key logical categories -- ""groceries"", ""tech"", ""rent"", ""retirement"", ""health"", ""nights out"", and whatever else makes sense to you. Then add them up, do the maths. Know what you're spending and how it compares, and how the categories make up your monthly budget.<p>Frugality is generally quite good, but just like code, it's quite possible to overoptimize it into a time-sink.<p>Also, it's key that you see both the high-cost single-time expenses and the low-cost-but-everyday expenses and you get an idea for how they compare. Depending on how often you visit Starbucks, it might be a very good or very insignificant change to brew your own coffee at home; go on and measure it.<p>The single most surprising thing that I discovered about this process was that, even though I feel like I give money to beggars in the street ""often"" (i.e. whenever I see them and they ask) and give ""a lot"" (i.e. much more than is normally typical), the amount that I give actually works out to almost nothing on a monthly basis. Like, I'm poor and right now I have no proper employment (they don't pay you to do a Master's degree) and yet I can still afford to be generous to the people who are down on their luck, and it's just nothing when you compare it to the amount I'd save if I stopped drinking cola. I've got no income, but I'd still easily spend  50 on food to throw a party for my friends, so long as it happens only about once a month, twice max.",1342097309

The thing you miss, though, is that there are all sorts of devices with which I can log in.<p>I have ssh on my cellphone which is on my person at all times, and while doing anything involved is difficult, I can usually verify that there is a problem and it's nature, and if it's easy, I can deal with it then.   But that satisfies the 'respond in five minutes' or whatever.  I responded, I can tell people involved what's up and how long it's going to take me to get more info.<p>The next step up is my laptop, which usually stays in the car.  I jog to the laptop, boot it up, use the cellular modem dongle thing, and it's about as good as being at home, most places.  I have a cheap inverter in the car if my batteries are low.<p>If I'm willing to take a social hit, I can also call someone else and say ""Hey, I'm drunk to the point where I can't handle root, or I'm 20 minutes out and my laptop took a shit.  X paged me.  can you deal with it?""  and repeat until someone says yes.  I look like a fool in front of my co-workers, but eh, the problem gets solved, and everyone does this every now and again.<p>(This is the big problem with being a sole founder.    You can't just call up a random consultant; you need to know the system to be able to fix it.  It's really nice to be able to call two or three people that know the system well enough to help you out in these times.  In this case, I think even someone that doesn't have a lot of experience but is willing to be trained, and that you can afford to pay often enough that your system is fresh in their mind, is better than just calling someone really good that doesn't know the system when the system is hoarked.)<p>So yeah, I can go to movies.   I might need to walk out of the movie, but I can go.  Restaurants are easy;  I don't even have to leave; I just whip out my laptop and fix what needs to be fixed.   dancing?  same deal.  Yeah, I look like a dork or an asshole if I get paged and I whip out the laptop in the middle of a social engagement, but honestly?  I'm not sure that really changes anything.<p>Really, anywhere I can take my laptop that has cell reception and power, I can go.   I mean, I know I might get interrupted, but I probably won't be.<p>The hard part is really the mental state.   You really want to make sure you go to bed before you are exhausted, because problems that take five minutes when you are fresh can take, well, much longer when you are not.  Alcohol too;  I find that the DMV limits are reasonable, and if I stay under those I can handle myself (on a computer;  I'm a little more conservative when it comes to driving, as I'm a pretty shitty driver to begin with.)    Sleep, really, is the problem I struggle with, but I have a hard time keeping a schedule anyhow.<p>(Oh, also, the 20 years is clearly a lie.  I'm what, 31?  something like that. and I think I got my first pager at 17, so considerably less than 20 years.

4234204,comment,4232044,4233714,4,0,saalweachter,,,"I'm actually looking forward to that.<p>I read a lot of golden and silver age science fiction.  One of the things I love about the oldies isn't that they're necessarily better than modern science fiction, it's that they're <i>short</i>.  <i>Creatures of Light and Darkness</i>, a fantastic book, is 192 pages.  It's a stand-alone story which spans thousands of years, the better part of the universe, and builds such wonderful characters.  And the author gets you from here to there in 192 pages.<p>Nowadays, you can't introduce a plot and two characters in 200 pages.  400, 500, 600 pages are the norm.  Some of it is style.  Sometimes you need 600 pages to tell a story.  But a portion of it is that authors are told, by their publishing companies, they need to target a certain size to get their books published, because a book needs to have a certain heft or it will never leave the shelf.  And it's a damn shame, because some of these 600 page monstrosities could have been a fantastic 200 page book.<p>Broadcast television also imposes certain constraints upon the show.  Some shows work well with this format, for instance, if the show is episodic in nature.  If the show is trying to tell a particular story, it works less well.<p>One thing that can go wrong is that not all stories that get turned into a TV show require 18 hours of video to tell.  A lot of filler is added, episodic episodes which get dropped into the middle of the story arc to drag things out.  If the show's producers and writers are good, they can use these filler episodes to flesh out the characters and the world.  But they aren't always good enough.<p>A second thing that can go wrong is that you don't always know when to end your story.  A show may get renewed for two or three or four seasons, and if you finished telling the story in the first season, you now have to come up with a completely new story for season two, or reveal that by a fiendish twist your story wasn't actually finished in the season finale like you thought it was.  This isn't always as ... <i>satisfying</i> as it could be.  Other times, you have to keep putting off finishing the story at the end of each season, which turns entire seasons into filler.  This carries the additional risk that you may get canceled in season three and never finish the story you started in season one.<p>I'm generally looking forward to the death of big media producers, because I think the quality of entertainment will go up once people are freed from the constraint of telling all of their stories in twenty to twenty-four 22 or 44 minute episodes.",1342096992

  $myString = sprintf('Total: %.2f', $myFloat); 

  ObjC:
  NSString *myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""Total: %.2f"", myFloat];

Maybe this is the reason these characters don't score too highly in overall frequency? I have no answer for the high frequency of '/'.",1342095037

However, it doesn't seem to have changed much since the last time it hit Hacker News [0].<p>There are websites that have chosen Persona as an authentication method. We now need to see the following two pieces implemented:<p>- It needs to be implemented in the browser's GUI, like in this old screenshot [1]. People will be able to see the usability and security benefits of having a standardised way to log in that's built-in into the browser. Could we at least have a Firefox extension or a nightly build of Firefox that does this?<p>- At least one email provider needs to be a Persona ""ID provider"", which would eliminate the need to create a Persona password and to click on a link in an email. My guess is that getting Gmail to support this would be slow work, why not try persuading smaller email providers like Fastmail to be the first to openly support Persona?<p>Fortunately, Persona does work even without these two pieces, using fall-back servers and a shim. But most of the benefits of Persona are only valid once the browser and the email provider deliberately support it.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2764824"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2764824</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://i50.tinypic.com/2ptyv80.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i50.tinypic.com/2ptyv80.jpg</a>",1342094713

I dislike to depend on others, I&#x27;m selfish in my own way, but I dislike it when people are struggling because they don&#x27;t have enough money to live. Just because they were born less lucky than I, or because something terrible happened to them, or because they made mistakes. I would find it hard to enjoy what I earned in the middle of a shanty town.<p>So I don&#x27;t moan and complain too much when I have to pay my taxes.

No, you can&#x27;t do functional programming in any language. In Java it&#x27;s more than just lack of syntactic sugar. Java&#x27;s type system actively fights against functional programming. This is a bit like saying that you can do OOP in any language. Yes, you can have GObject in C. Yes, for Java there have been attempts like www.functionaljava.org ; but it sucks so badly that almost nobody does it, unless they are forced to do it.<p>In fact I challenge the author of this article to show me a piece of FP code that he wrote in Java by himself.<p>> <i>What about all the wonderful things in the standard library? Yep, filter and map and fold operations on collections out of the box is nice. That the SDK uses Option instead of null is an improvement. These things are nice, but I generally get what I’m looking for by adding some libraries to core Java.</i><p>I do know Java&#x27;s ecosystem and he must be speaking about Guava, as there&#x27;s no other stable library for Java that has persistent data-structures. And Guava kind of sucks, so if you&#x27;re looking for persistent data-structures, might as well implement them yourself, it&#x27;s fun and it might open your eyes to what functional programming is ;-)<p>Speaking of Guava&#x27;s Option, lets talk about how Guava&#x27;s Option is not a Monad, or for those that don&#x27;t know what that is, basically a context that implements map and flatMap with certain properties. Scala&#x27;s Option also implements filter and fold, etc... which in regards to the purpose of a Monad, in the words of Erik Meijer, <i>is to guide you through the happy path</i>. Now that&#x27;s a little closer to functional programming and speaking of Erik Meijer, people might be interested in what he thinks about Scala: <a href=""https://twitter.com/headinthebox/status/438355100310831104"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/headinthebox/status/438355100310831104</a><p>On the bad things he lists:<p>> <i>Compile Time</i><p>Scala&#x27;s type-system is much more static, leaving much less room for accidental bugs. Scala&#x27;s compiler does things that in other languages you&#x27;d need to run specialized tools to get the same results or to write more tests. A single sentence or paragraph can&#x27;t do it justice, but the big compile times are perfectly justified and this is coming from a developer that prior to Scala preferred dynamic languages with instant edit/reload cycles.<p>Besides, these times have been dropping as the core Scala devs have been making improvements, with another batch of optimizations coming in Scala 2.11. And incremental compilation in general works great. And I&#x27;m a developer, I have a good dev machine - if you don&#x27;t have an SSD and at least 8 GB of RAM, then you&#x27;ve got no excuse.<p>> <i>The IDEs</i><p>I&#x27;ve been using IntelliJ IDEA since a year ago and for people reading the rant exposed by the article - IntelliJ IDEA 13 for Scala is everything you&#x27;d expect an IDE to be and more. I never had problems with renaming things. I never had problems with finding all usages of a type. IntelliJ IDEA 13 works flawlessly for viewing the inheritance hierarchy and I&#x27;m doing the Cake Pattern which is freakishly heavy on the traits ;-) Other languages only dream about such awesome IDE support.<p>> <i>Overuse of Operator Overloading</i><p>He complains about SBT, but I thought we were talking about the language and the standard library. Pity that he doesn&#x27;t exemplify an instance in which &quot;+&quot; is overused.<p>> <i>Implicit</i><p>He mentions implicit parameters, but exemplifies with implicit conversions. Implicit conversions are in fact considered experimental and starting with Scala 2.10 the compiler will issue warnings in case you&#x27;re using them without allowing &quot;language.implicitConversions&quot;, being replaced with extension methods by means of implicit classes.<p>Yet, he doesn&#x27;t mention Type Classes, the main use-case for implicit parameters. IMHO, I can&#x27;t stand languages that do not have this form of ad-hoc polymorphism.<p>> <i>How much of your time, as a software developer, do you spend doing stuff that is language agnostic?</i><p>That&#x27;s setting up a straw-man. The problem we as software developers are trying to solve when picking new languages is one of gaining access to abstractions that are otherwise very difficult to express and use. Implement something like Iteratees in Java, a higher-level abstraction for safe asynchronous stream processing with back-pressure built in and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.",1395683452
7459888,comment,7458722,7459430,23,0,masklinn,,,"> I thought Erlang was already fast?<p>Erlang has a pretty good runtime, is fast at IO and is excellent at concurrency and reliability[-2]. Erlang itself is a &quot;fairly slow&quot; language: for imperative, CPU-bound and non-distributable[-1] workload you&#x27;ll probably be closer to Python than to C.<p>However, note that this does not make Erlang faster, it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; an LLVM-based backend for HiPE.<p>HiPE (High Performance Erlang) is a >15 years old native compiler for Erlang (integrated to the standard distribution), but with Erlang being what it is (a dynamically typed functional language) it&#x27;s best used as a form of &quot;manual JIT&quot; by profiling, extracting and compiling small subsets of the application: indiscriminately used on everything it will just generate boatloads of slow and useless &quot;native&quot; code which is just a deoptimization over standard BEAM (it will likely run at the same speed but eat more memory).<p>Part of HiPE&#x27;s pipeline is the generation of native code itself, and the goal of this project (ultimately) is to replace existing hand-rolled codegen with LLVM (and benefit from its optimizations), thus simplifying maintenance by moving codegen to a third-party project. Most of HiPE (integration with the VM and generation of HiPE&#x27;s own IR before codegen) remains, and according to [0] ErLLVM is slightly <i>slower</i> than existing HiPE backends at the moment.<p>If you want more info on ErLLVM, [0] has a bunch. For HiPE, [1] is the easy mode and [2] is hard mode<p>[-2] reliability is the original goal of Erlang, and contrary to most languages Erlang reached concurrency and distribution with reliability — rather than performances — in mind: it comes from telcos, where things have to keep running and a single machine means your stuff is down when (not if) the machine dies or crashes<p>[-1] Erlang&#x27;s VM is fully multithreaded, by default.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/519/erllvm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/519/erllv...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/didip/high-performance-erlang"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/didip/high-performance-erlang</a> [Comic Sans warning]<p>[2] <a href=""http://user.it.uu.se/~pergu/papers/erlang03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://user.it.uu.se/~pergu/papers/erlang03.pdf</a> &quot;All you wanted to know about the HiPE compiler&quot;",1395683451

We are for example able to search all cities from Geonames (> 3M) on a old iPhone 3GS in less than 50ms (including prefix search & typo tolerance) with only 1KB or RAM and a flash disk.

7459493,comment,7457754,7457754,2,0,impassebreaker,,,"Interesting.  A couple of observations, from grappling with some of the same issues for our negotiation site.<p>Definitely agree that you wouldn&#x27;t want to share the seller&#x27;s bottom line in the event of a match.  This would lead to built-in buyer&#x27;s remorse.  I gather this may have been for initial proof of concept, not long-term functionality.  But you also need to think about the impact of masking the algorithm (see below) so it can&#x27;t be reverse engineered (on the flip-side) and consider what information can and should be given about the process.<p>Agree with one of the comments below that slowing down the result may make for better user experience.  This was (surprising) feedback we received for impassebreaker.com -- people felt &quot;let down&quot; when the match was revealed too fast.  There&#x27;s a game component here, and a big splash may be important.  Then again, it does seem a bit deceptive to show a progress bar when the result is already calculated.<p>Subjective observation, but based on a decent amount of feedback.  Users need to trust that the process is fair.  Trust is hard.  If you place the bottom line in context -- e.g., show your user what the comparative price is on other sites -- would that context make the bargaining process smoother and build more trust?  Might it also make the site stickier?  If your provide the comparison shopping data, then people won&#x27;t need to leave the site to do comparison shopping.  That may or may not make you more appealing to sellers, so perhaps it&#x27;s not on point.  As it stands, the process seems arbitrary -- I totally understand that this is an early sketch, but if/as you build it, I&#x27;d keep this in mind.  I can&#x27;t remember the cites, but I believe there&#x27;s some research out there that suggests that people are more inclined to trust computers in a negotiation than other people.  So you have a potential advantage if you make the playing field seem a bit more level.  At the end of the day, what you may be building is a trust machine.  Maybe it&#x27;s different, but that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve thought of our platform.<p>Negotiation style is culture and language dependent.  The verbal dynamic that works in the Suk won&#x27;t necessarily work in Omaha.  One isn&#x27;t better than the other, of course.  But if the goal is closing sales, you need to keep context and language in mind, and at a very granular level.  Words and how they are presented are key.  Maybe that&#x27;s part of what the system learns.<p>Best of luck.  There&#x27;s some potential here, long term, for something very cool.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see where you take this.",1395681135

And it makes sense, if you pay a smaller premium each month, you&#x27;ll have to pay a great share of the costs when the they do occur.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think this will work out in the long run.  It&#x27;s one thing to ask a patient to pay 50% of a $300/month prescription (even though that&#x27;s too much for many patients), but it&#x27;s another to ask for 50% of a $10,000/month prescription (not uncommon for cancer).<p>The ACA did put a total cap on patient-cost sharing at $6,350 per individual or $12,700 per family [1].  This is a good thing since many plans prior had no limit on out of pocket costs.  However, $6,350 is still a lot to ask lower income patients to pay.<p>One interesting outcome of this is that most drug companies are stepping up and offer patient assistance with these costs.  For example, you might get a debit card that pays anything over $20, which makes it much more affordable.  The funny part is that insurance companies typically <i>hate</i> patient co-pay cards since they defeat the purpose of co-payments (drugs the insurance company don&#x27;t want you to use are more expensive).  However, for the really expensive drugs, insurance companies are not complaining at all.  In the end, it just results in a discount by the manufacturer, in a roundabout way.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-maximum-limit/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-maximum-li...</a>",1395681121

And then a week without any prescriptions and dangerously high intraocular pressure trying to get the doctor to prescribe something cheaper when they themselves don&#x27;t know how much anything costs and will just throw the whole medicine cabinet at you in hopes that something sticks.

I even keep running into _pharmacy techs_ that ask me with a priceless facial expression if I really, really, really want the specific asthma inhalers and quantity that I&#x27;m picking up because they keep experiencing sticker shock - &quot;I can ask the pharmacist and your doctor to get you a different one&quot; naw, they&#x27;re all expensive, they were always expensive, and nothing will change it.

The headline is link bait: Before the ACA she was paying entirely out of pocket, and now she isn&#x27;t but it&#x27;s still expensive.  I have very expensive insure and it only brings it down to $50/mo so $85/mo seems reasonable for a cheap plan.<p>Anyway, to back up what i just said, here&#x27;s the unabridged 2nd paragraph:\n&quot;Under the plan, her Celebrex would have cost $648 a month until she met her $1,500 prescription deductible, followed by an $85 monthly co-pay.&quot;<p>followed by the following in the 5th paragraph:\n&quot;Before the federal health law took effect, Mason paid slightly more for her monthly premium on a plan that didn&#x27;t cover her arthritis or pain medications and some routine doctor&#x27;s visits.&quot;<p>A lot of the other examples they have are &quot;patient was trying to get name brand drug rather than the available generic&quot;.

Rather than constantly digging through documentation I can see that, for example, some flatMap will give me a list of (Id, User) tuples, so then I can call map( case(id, user) => user) ) (or just map(_._2)) and pull out the user objects to get my list of users from my list of tuples. This lets me focus on the business logic and not spend all my brain power tracking types.  I don&#x27;t think I would have survived my first foray into building complicated composite ResultSet parsers in anorm without the IDE.<p>I&#x27;m sure that as I gain more experience and all the functions become second nature I&#x27;ll be able to track it in a text editor but for now I love my IDE.",1395680546

That may not be true, but your alternative hypothesis isn&#x27;t actually an alternative. At least not as I understand it.<p>That said, I do think controlling for follower counts would be informative. It would help tell you if there&#x27;s actually something else at play (e.g. once you control for follower count, there&#x27;s no more correlation). I suspect it could also tell you the # of hashtags is even more important than currently shown because it also helps build your base of followers, by reaching more new visitors.<p>E.g. If increased hashtags increase my number of favorites, they also increase my number of followers by some percentage. Then each successive post has a larger direct reach of followers, in addition to the new visitor reach from hashtag discovery. A single hashtag could actually have a compounding value.",1395680461

Through this, it is able to make smart decisions about how to update the real DOM in the most conservative manner possible.<p>> Because it only touches the parts of the DOM it needs to, you can write your templates in the way that makes the most sense for your app, without having to worry about the performance headaches of constantly trashing the DOM or the code headache of wiring up a plethora of view objects.<p>Huh, the solution he described is basically the technique I use in Mithril[1], except that Mithril templates don&#x27;t need the extra HTML parsing step because they pretty much <i>are</i> the AST.<p>My bare-bones approach received some criticism here last week for not being &quot;pretty&quot; (for the &quot;HTML is pretty&quot; definition of &quot;pretty&quot;), but it allows better debuggability[2], and opens the doors for some interesting FP techniques, among other things.<p>Templating seems to be a hot button these days, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that it&#x27;s such a complex topic. Discussions about performance like this article are great, but it&#x27;s hard for non-framework devs to keep all the other facets of template design in their heads when trying to evaluate the bazillion choices in the market.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/issues/16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/issues/16</a>",1395680410

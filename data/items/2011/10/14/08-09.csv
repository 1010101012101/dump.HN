And they don't understand how it works, and how it is in other ways broken (they can't login to wp-admin anymore, but hey... it's OK, they can copy the Wordpress database from staging).<p>This has also taken them 2 weeks to achieve.<p>When asked why they didn't just change the routing rules, add Varnish and configure Wordpress to know what domain it's on (so they don't have to rewrite anything), they simply shrugged and explained that it's working now.<p>PS: If anyone wants a technical co-founder in London, or an Architect/CTO level person who can hire good people and build good teams. Please speak to me. I'm not sure I can take the madness of working for other people much longer.",1318582749

3110505,comment,3109283,3110454,1,0,todsul,,,"Yes, we previously used template caching because it was built into Symfony1 (an MVC PHP framework). Symfony2 now leaves caching to the HTTP Standard, plus integrates Akamai's ESI. Symfony specifically recommends Varnish for live projects.<p>Memcache certainly has its place, but for me, Varnish is a plug-n-play solution that doesn't require code changes. Even with ESI, if you've already set HTTP Cache, you just need to set s-maxage per component. That's it. Then of course there's all the Varnish load balancing features that I haven't used.<p>If my site didn't use logins, I'd definitely just go for Nginx + fastcgi_cache. People argue that Apache can do the same with the right tuning. But there's something to be said for a 5 minute VPS build by a complete novice that can serve 20,000 requests per second using about 10 lines of config code.<p>I think this all becomes much more complicated for seriously large websites. That's where memcache/redis et al. join the party, potentially with Varnish.",1318582656

Some people want Kramer's vision of building your own pizza, both for fun and to get exactly the pizza you want. Most people would rather have pizza driven to their house after a 1 minute phone call, and if they lose some freedom over the exact topping placement and the kind of crust used, they're quite fine with that.<p>Yeah, this was a really boneheaded platform decision, and I'll be very frustrated if Apple doesn't fix it.

And the idea that I can theoretically crack open the source to my app (the Venn intersection of those with the time, ability, and willingness to do so are a speck, by the way) doesn't help me after the cache is already cleared while I'm sitting on the plane.<p>I don't care whether something is defective by design, or defective by lack of design: I care that it's defective, period.<p>The day that technology vendors start engaging in things like free speech suppression or non-consensual privacy invasion is the day I'm willing to think of computing as being a political issue.

If it sucks enough, people will stop buying it, and/or the vendor will make it suck it less.

But why can't there be something like an ""analog digital"" watch? A watch that is stylish and has the ""I could make one of those"" thing going for it while still being as effectively readable as a digital one.<p>The idea I tried to describe in the post (though poorly it seems) is this: Don't make the hands of the watch move but move the dial below. This way your eyes won't have to do searching because they always know where to look for the hand. Now if you have separate dials for hour and minute you will have exactly two places to look at - and those will never change position - like with a digital watch.",1318580064

3110426,comment,3108563,3108956,11,0,dextorious,,,"> This general problem is a symptom of a major issue regarding the use of software that does not respect the freedom of its users.<p>Developers are not users. I don't particularly want my mobile phone to respect the ""freedom of its developers"". I <i>do</i> want to be sure that no app I install at a whim hogs the disk down, installs spyware or f*ks the phone when I'm in need to make an important call. If I wanted ""developer freedom"" I'd choose OpenMoko. Strangely, millions of us did not.<p>> Every non-apple developer and user is required to bend to the will of the programmers who develop the proprietary iOS.<p>He's only ""required"" so if he chooses to use iOS. And if he chooses to use iOS, it's because the platform attracted him, and one thing that attracts a lot of people to it it's the ""it just works"" and ""you don't have to manage it"".<p>> Any negative choices or limitations imposed by Apple Inc. are virtually uncircumventable.<p>Yeah. Except if you jailbreak.<p>> On the other hand, if users and developers in a community are free to view, modify and share the source code of the operating system and programs they are using, then that creates a dynamic where software cannot remain defective by design, something which cannot be said about Apple's hardware or software.<p>Yes. Then you get the mighty OpenMoko. Not defective by design. Yay!<p>> If we were talking about free (as in speech) software, users would have control of their data, and their choice of how to manage it; not some distant programmers working for a corporation's bottom line.<p>Yes, for a brief time in college I'd quote RMS too.

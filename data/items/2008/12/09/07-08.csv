391091,comment,390980,390980,0,0,larryfreeman,,,"I think that the article is a bit naive.  While the growth of ad revenues is undoubtedly decreasing and most likely spending will greatly dip as the ""panic"" continues, this doesn't mean that a web businesses cannot be successful on ad revenue.<p>Newspapers succeeded during the Great Depression as did radio and other ad-based businesses.<p>But this time, newspapers are going out of business because people are getting their news from the web (the classic Innovator's Dilemma pattern).  Indeed, with the recession, people will have even more time to surf the web so web traffic and the importance of the web will continue to increase.<p>Where the eyeballs are, ads must go especially during a downturn.  In the next 2-3 years, especially after we move away from ""panic"" and back to recovery, it seems to me, web ad spending will start growing again.<p>I should also mention that I currently work at an start up that depends on web-based ad sales.  I've had opportunities to move somewhere else but my gut feeling is that a lean business with a high quality product is the place to be right now, even if it depends on ad sales for its profitability.",1228808097

Everyone seems to be booked with other projects, which I fully understand. That is why I came here.<p>I've been on Hacker News for a very long time now just acting as a sponge and absorbing as much information as possible. I love the community here on Hacker News, they make everyone feel welcomed and a part of the community in some way. But I have a problem and that is why I am laying it out before the community I trust and need.<p>So basically this is the description we came up with:<p>We'd like someone who knows the web and its entirety to help us bring our exciting new product to market. Being proficient in PHP / MySQL / Javascript / CSS is essential. Design skillz is a big plus. Really we're looking for  anyone that is interested and that can help in any way possible.<p>We're also going to be working with many API's, so whatever that requires as well.<p>Thank you so much.<p>Please email jeff@ampley.com",1228807583

Good Luck!<p>They've been in trouble for quite a while thanks to Craigslist and the web in general.

I didn&#x27;t notice any change after just a month, it took a year; I&#x27;m taking a break at the moment to see if any symptoms resurface. The original article for this thread mentioned that the mouse model the researchers are building indicates that successive generations of mice with weaker biomes did not improve after starting on a heavier-fiber diet (though long-term, who knows if it might start improving). Might there be a possibility that biome damage has a similar pathology, and reconstitution via probiotics takes an especially long time? Nobody knows at this point.<p>GB is not exactly cheap if you are on a student budget, so in the interest of full disclosure and crufty, messy, crowd sourcing pseudo-science, I&#x27;ll offer some caveats of what else I was trying at the same time that might have also yielded my results. I tried two other brands of probiotic before settling on GB: Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s and Bio-K+. Six months on Bio-K+ followed by two months on Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s. At the same time, I went to a 20 mg / day maximum net carbohydrate, high-fat, moderate protein diet. I used testing strips to verify that I actually went into ketosis, and cycled to a 100 mg net carbohydrate day once 1-2 months to break weight loss plateaus. So before you &quot;follow in my footsteps&quot; and commit to a year of GB, be aware I had confounding factors that might also explain what happened to me (the ketogenic diet is the next candidate for a cause, but I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone being able to eat spicy foods again by starting that diet).<p>If I had the time and access, I&#x27;d pay to try bacteriotherapy using donor material from an athletic donor who likes spicy food. I suspect bacteriotherapy is good for more than just CDI.<p>The GB guys are super helpful and friendly, and you go month-to-month. I found suspending or cancelling super easy and hassle-free. So if you are curious to partake in your own N=1 experiment on gut microbiome reconstitution for just a month (though they themselves say don&#x27;t count on any changes before within months), I encourage you to try it out and share your results.",1447361983

Once I have a test suite I think is robust, I&#x27;ll go through the code again with a coverage tool, which will usually identify error paths I didn&#x27;t exercise and keep me honest. For examples, a code refactor might have introduced new error cases which weren&#x27;t needed in the old code, and some code - like cleanup handling around ^C handling - is not worth fully automating; code coverage will help spot where manual tests are needed.<p>But I really wanted to comment about one of the comments described in this essay:<p>> One respondent seemed to conclude that the team who had 95% coverage [vs. 45%] clearly didn’t understand TDD and therefore they’d look in that program for defects.<p>The original TDD proponents were very enthusiastic that TDD would lead to high coverage.

Amanita contains about 600 varieties (wiki lists 500ish). Of those 500, for my region only, I would need to learn how to identify about 30 varieties. A reasonably feasible amount! But wait... we can trim that number down some more. Ignoring the ones where edibility is unknown, that leaves <i>only 10 or so</i> to identify. Anyone who cared enough could likely easily learn to tell them apart.

That it&#x27;s not possible to separate a long-term 400k-year temperature variation trend from short term temperature variations due to unusual/novel forcing conditions?<p>The thing your hot summer day analysis is missing is a clear physical explanation that explains why the trend you are observing is occurring, and why it is going to keep occurring until 24:00.

Let&#x27;s ignore the fact that this isn&#x27;t necessarily a great idea, and assume someone has gone ahead and done it. We can predict with reasonable confidence what the primary consequences of this intervention will be: less light from the sun hits the planet, planet&#x27;s mean temperature lowers a bit.

They are currently trading in the $2.70 range.  From a company perspective, they killed it by IPO-ing -- they took $700m worth of cash, most of which I believe they still have (as of a few months ago they still had ~$1bn in cash equivalents).<p>Zynga: IPOed at $10/share, raising roughly $1bn.  They are currently trading at $2.48.  Same basic story as above.  Their current market cap is just about double what they raised in cash at their IPO.<p>So from two perspectives, these companies did exceedingly well:  their investors and founders likely cashed out most of their chips at IPO, so they made a killing, and the company received a tremendous amount of cash for their coffers.  Sure, Groupon and Zynga booted their CEOs, but they don&#x27;t care much, and I&#x27;m sure whoever they got to replace them is handsomely compensated (regardless of how well they do).<p>So who gets screwed?  Employees, who don&#x27;t get to sell their shares until the company has tanked, and whichever investors are stuck holding the bag after IPO.  But after the IPO, there&#x27;s not much of an incentive for these early people to care about that;  if they get canned, who cares, they&#x27;ll cash out their $100m worth of compensation and go work at some other company down the street.",1447359341

NASA managers recorded this result as demonstrating that the O-rings had a &quot;safety factor&quot; of 3.

To paraphrase Feynman&#x27;s example, if engineers built a bridge that could bear 3,000 pounds without any damage, even though it was never expected to bear more than 1,000 pounds in practice, the safety factor would be 3.

10555704,comment,10553837,10553837,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"I&#x27;ve interviewed for a number of these types of jobs in the last year or so. The pay is just too poor to even think about it. One large university with a super well-funded and growing medical school in a huge mega-city was looking to hire someone with 5+ years of deep experience in both Python and C/C++, as well as some familiarity or past education in statistics and machine learning, to be the software development lead for a set of research groups. They weren&#x27;t willing to go above $90k/year.<p>In another case, I interviewed with a school of public health at an Ivy university. It was in a medium-to-large city on the east coast, where the cost of living was certainly higher than national average, but not insanely high. Even still, they were looking to pay in the range of $75k for someone with significant years of experience in the scientific Python stack.<p>Not only does this fail to compare even with start-ups that aren&#x27;t located in major tech hubs, but also when compared against salaries offered by established companies in the same cities, it&#x27;s almost a 2x pay jump (more in some cases), for the same skill set.<p>To boot, these lab/university environments tend to have many of the same political issues that any other organization has. Sometimes they are <i>slightly</i> more generous with vacation time and work/life balance, but not always. But you are generally also working with a lot of research staff who see &quot;programming&quot; as a nuisance that gets in the way of their research, rather than seeing programming as the medium of expression of their research. So when you lobby for using good tools, good workflow practices, and try to teach people how to write reasonable software, you usually get a lot of pushback that people just don&#x27;t like doing it that way, and since you&#x27;re the super low-status programmer, your opinion generally doesn&#x27;t count for much, even if you can back it up with more substance.<p>You also carry some employment risk when projects are funded by grants. Even large, well-established, multi-year grants can be suddenly changed or reduced when there is significant political change in the funding organizations. And a lot of the universities, at least, are unwilling to hire these kinds of expensive programmers as permanent university employees.<p>You&#x27;d probably have a much better career if you instead went to work as a programming-literate business analyst in some part of the university&#x27;s fundraising / business departments.<p>In the end, these places can only afford developers with very little experience, or people who don&#x27;t understand the cost of living differential in the city they are moving to, or I guess are independently wealthy and just prefer to be a low-status programmer in one of these labs.<p>Edit: Another thing that struck me -- in a lot of these university research situations, the programming talent that they need to hire is genuinely just harder to find / harder to replace than even the research talent you would be working for.<p>Since there&#x27;s a huge surplus of Ph.D. and post-doc labor, you could staff the domain expert research side of things much more easily than the programmer side -- especially if you need someone who is truly full-stack to do things ranging from migrating legacy research data to a cloud platform all the way up to designing fancy UI demos with d3.<p>If you look at another set of industries where the lower-level contributors are much harder to employ than the manager -- professional team sports -- you see that the market dictates that the lower level experts (the actual players on a sports team) almost always command more salary than the coach. There can be exceptions, like Phil Jackson (but even he didn&#x27;t earn more than his best players) and there will be backup players who earn less. But the general idea seems to hold true.<p>This means that a lot of these scientific labs and universities will eventually have to face the market reality that the domain expert labor is just not worth as much as the software design labor. Or else they can just keep on compromising on the quality of the software and try to hold on to a worldview where scraping by with bottom-of-the-barrel software development is good enough. It might work for them for a while longer, but I doubt it will work for too long.",1447358628

The pain point again in my experience, is not any of the issues cited in that presentation, but rather that GC gets bound up in a wad eventually when you have large (>10k) numbers of threads in a JVM (and any reasonably complex application). This is because the object graph becomes highly interconnected through the Thread and associated TLS objects. YMMV of course. Definitely agree that the &quot;async is fast&quot; myth needs debunking, though.",1447358588

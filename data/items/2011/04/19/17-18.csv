This doesn't mean that I can't travel onsite and visit your office regularly, nor does it mean skype and phone don't work out here in the sticks :)<p>Telecommuting requires the entire team or ideally the entire company be set up to work like that - just having one guy out in a different state or country on his own doesn't work very well in most cases.

What I don't get is why more companies aren't structuring themselves to take advantage of remote workers.<p>If you have strong procedures in place to deal with remote/offsite workers (fulltime or not), you can more easily integrate short term labor when you need it - you'll have the shared workspaces, file transfers, documentation, version control, etc, already set up and ready to let new people in as needed.<p>This seems like this would be a competitive advantage that more companies should be looking at.

I would recommend:<p>- Have the user access the app/site when they notice they are having a migraine.  At that point ask a battery of questions to see if the ""triggers"" can be narrowed down.  I personally have three triggers.<p>- Once the user has confirmed a migraine, THEN you should ping the user to see how bad it is, what the current symptoms are, and if is ongoing.  I generally have migraines lasting for 3-5 hours with varying symptoms depending on what ""stage"" I'm in.

PHOTO: AFP<p>CAIRO: Hosni Mubarak was ordered detained for 15 days on Wednesday, winning the ruling army generals a respite from protests by quashing suspicions that they were shielding their former commander from investigation.<p>Mubarak, driven from presidential office on Feb 11 by mass demonstrations against his 30-year rule, was admitted to hospital on Tuesday suffering what state media called a heart crisis. Reports conflicted on the seriousness of his illness.<p>The public prosecutor had summoned and questioned Mubarak over the killing of protesters, embezzling of public funds and abuse of power. More than 380 protesters were killed in 18-days of demonstrations that led to Mubaraks downfall.<p>Former President Hosni Mubarak was detained for 15 days for investigation, state television reported. It said his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, have also been questioned as part of the probe and ordered detained.<p>In his first public comment since stepping down, broadcast on Al Arabiya on Sunday, Mubarak denied wrongdoing.<p>An army helicopter landed near Mubaraks hospital in Sharm el-Sheikh on Wednesday to take the former president to Cairo, Al Jazeera reported. One security source told Reuters that Mubarak could be moved to Cairo or the outskirts to assist the probe.<p>There was no official confirmation. Another security source earlier said Mubarak was expected to stay in Sharm el-Sheikh.<p>The official news agency also said it was not yet determined where Mubarak would be taken. It reported heavy security around the hospital in the Red Sea resort.<p>The source said Mubaraks sons were taken to a prison on the outskirts of Cairo, joining a list of ex-ministers and officials under investigation and held in the same jail.<p>Gamal, 47, Mubaraks younger son, held a top post in the ruling party. Many Egyptians believed he was being groomed for top office, although both father and son denied any such plan.<p>This is a serious step forward in holding the president accountable and ends any suspicion that the state and the military were in cahoots with Mubarak, said Hassan Nafaa, a political scientist and activist for reform.<p>We want our money<p>Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians protested on Friday in Cairos Tahrir Square over delays in trying Mubarak and criticised Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the army council head who was Mubaraks defence minister for 20 years.<p>The military council moved fast because of the pressure protesters have built up in Tahrir. In the past weeks there has been real criticism of Tantawi and the military council that they are slow and looking after Mubarak as their commander, said Shadi Ghazali Harb, from a pro-democracy youth movement.<p>He said plans for another protest on Friday were on hold to see how swiftly the army and prosecutor moved towards a trial.<p>Political analyst Fahmy Hueidi said: The army succumbed to people pressure to bring Mubarak and family to justice.<p>On Tuesday, soldiers broke up a five-day sit-in at Tahrir Square, the epicentre of Egypts uprising in January.<p>Protesters had vowed to keep up the pressure, although many ordinary Egyptians are tired of the protests that have hammered the economy and disrupted their lives.<p>There were conflicting reports about Mubaraks condition. A state television report said he was in intensive care after a heart crisis during questioning. Al Arabiya said he was fit enough to be questioned in hospital in Sharm el-Sheikh.<p>The timing of his health setback prompted skepticism among some protesters about the motives of the army, which has pushed for swift elections to hand over power. The army praised and thanked Mubarak when he left office, but protesters criticized him for ruling by emergency law and widening a rich-poor divide.<p>We want our money. We want the thief to be tried, chanted dozens of people near the hospital on Tuesday in the resort where Mubarak spent more and more time before leaving office.<p>Diplomats say there is no sign the military wants to hold on in government but say it may loom in the background as the nations self-appointed guardian.<p>Mubarak has suffered from health problems in recent years and went to Germany for gall bladder surgery in March 2010.<p>There were frequent rumours about his health as he aged, particularly after his last bout of surgery.<p>Mubarak vowed to die in Egypt when he addressed the countrys 80 million people shortly before he stepped down.<p>After Fridays demonstration, soldiers and police used tasers and batons to try to drive out the protesters after nightfall. Medical sources said 13 men were wounded by gunfire and two died. The army denied using live ammunition.<p>Angry protesters demanded the army hand power to civilians, but soldiers moved in on Tuesday to end the sit-in. Soldiers with rifles rounded up several young men and pushed them into vans. They gathered up barbed wire used by demonstrators to block the square and dismantled makeshift barriers.",1303234750

Take the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and DJIA since 2000.  Show portfolios on each made of 90+, <10, etc -- rebalanced annually and monthly.  Show the number of holdings per rebalance period.

It would have taken me days of hard study to understand what this undoubtedly clever people have done, even though I have a PhD in physics. From how excited they seem to be about their own work, I would guess its probably a very nice piece of theoretical physics. But a few things are clear, from their own words:<p>- They have not actually fabricated a solar cell, their most optimistic expectation based on this technology is 10% efficiency. With efficiencies bellow 14% you cant compete with other energy sources (you can not reach grid parity), even if your solar cells are so cheap that they are free. That is because the solar cell itself is only a fraction of the costs of solar energy. Think of land, maintenance, support structures, cabling, power electronics, and so on. That means that this concept, as it is, is useless for solar energy production, just like ""organic"" and other fashionable solar cell technologies.\n- The effects they are talking about happen when light has an intensity, in their own words ""as low as 10^7 W/cm2"" that is a hundred million times more intense than the light from the sun. You need a big, expensive laser to observe the effects they are talking about.\n- This is just one more case of people trying to spin their work as a revolution in solar energy, just because it is fashionable and it gives you publicity and funding for your research. They are probably fooling themselves in the first place, but that is no excuse. This type of thing is terribly detrimental for all of us, as it takes funding and attention from the solar cell technologies that actually work. This is a shame for the people involved, and for the University of Michigan.\n- If you want to make a bet on solar cells, bet for III-V concentrator solar cells. These are the most efficient ones, by far, (above 40%), and can be used under optical concentration (up to a thousand suns) making the cost of the cell itself almost irrelevant.",1303234571

2463272,comment,2459020,2459951,1,0,pstack,,,"The thing is, the signal on a social network like Facebook is not strong enough to overcome the noise and it would require that I spend precious time parsing through a significant amount of that noise just to reach the few rare bits of signal. I'm not concerned about myself over-sharing, because I have at least some reasonable sense of ""is anyone going to give a damn and will this be of any benefit to anyone whatsoever"". I'm more concerned with he deluge of other people's mundane daily lives. I don't need to be a receptacle of their stream of consciousness and I don't need the chore of parsing through it for anything useful.<p>I'm, frankly, a little offended that you are suggesting that snobbery is involved and that it has an element of ""well, your commentary doesn't my <i>my</i> needs the priority, so it is therefore of no interest to me"". That's hardly it, at all. It's more an issue of ""I don't need to be bombarded with every trivial thought and action of your entire daily life and I would not bombard you with the same"". News shock -- you are not that important and neither am I. And you don't need to post the constant stream of inanity to ""keep in touch"" -- assuming that you even need a third party utility to ""keep in touch"" (isn't that what email is for?).<p>For example, I finally logged into my Facebook account while posting this and here were the most recent updates that greeted me. Note that the age of every poster here is between 25 and 50. No, I'm not solving world hunger, but am I a snob for saying that all of the below is a complete waste of my time and that the only reason a person would post any of these things is that they either have keyboard-turrettes or are some degree of attention whore?<p>Do <i>I</i> have anything more significant to say with the same frequency of all these inane posts? Do I have anything truly earth shattering and mind-bending and enlightening that absolutely must be shared with a hundred people several times per day? No, I don't. So I don't post. I choose not to add to the noise that other people (presumably people that I am either close friends with or at least vaguely associated with) have to sift through. Interesting how that makes me a snob, rather than considerate.<p>* Someone posted a picture of their cat.<p>* Someone posted a picture of something really old in their freezer and asked if they should still eat it.<p>* Someone made a snarky comment about Obama.<p>* Several people posted links spamming projects they're doing (shows, events, etc).<p>* Someone posted their tarot reading (again).<p>* Someone said they should have been in bed an hour ago.<p>* Someone answered questions in some app about how tall they are.<p>* Someone said they saved a lot of money grocery shopping today.<p>* Someone liked Dial brand soap.<p>* Someone said the work day will never end.<p>* Someone said they ""love being a mommy"".<p>* Several people posted links to random stupid youtube videos.<p>* Several more stupid updates from apps (no matter how many you click ""hide"" on, there are always more).<p>* Someone said ""that dream was different!""<p>* Someone made some vague drama-infused comment about their relationship or a friendship or something (I couldn't tell which).<p>* Someone said they can't wait for Friday.<p>Another way of thinking of this. I call my mom maybe once a month and talk to her for half an hour or so. The woman who gave birth to me. The woman who raised me. The woman who sacrificed a lot in life to make sure that I was fortunate enough to become the person that I am today. I talk to her once a month-ish. Just long enough to catch up on the most important things and let her know she's important in our lives.<p>I would not want a running stream of every action and thought my own mom made. Why on <i>earth</i> would I want one every hour or two from every single friend or associate I have. People overshare. Too much and too frequently. And too trivially. Whatever happened to going out and having a drink and shooting the shit with your friends? That's fine, every now and then. Keeping in touch when something big is fine. I don't, however, need to hear from you every damn hour on every damn thing going on. And they don't need to hear that from me, either.<p>As I said, people absolutely adore talking about themselves. They are attention-whores. They want to broadcast as much inanity and/or drama as they possibly can to the largest audience they possibly can and it's usually a one-way-street (though even more so on Twitter). If they had even one second of consideration for the value of their contribution and the value of their ""friends"" time, they wouldn't post nearly as much of the crap that they do.<p>And it's not just your buddy. Or the guy at work. Or the ex-girlfriend. Or the random dude you met at a convention that friended you when you got back home. It's the tech celebs. It's the tech industry darlings. It's Scoble and Kevin Rose and everyone else. Trust me, I've considered following the twitter feeds of some of these people. After all, they stumble on to some cool things and have some interesting thoughts to offer. But even with these people, the level of noise is just incredible. So much so that I stopped following any of them ages ago and don't bother to follow anyone anymore, because I know that for every interesting 140 characters I get from them, I'll have to pour through many thousands of characters of trivial crap (or even meaningless crap, when it's just semi-inside stuff between them and someone else).<p>My time and attention isn't more valuable than anyone else's, but that doesn't mean that it should be wasted, either. It seems entirely reasonable to expect people to have at least a little bit of a filter on their output with respect for the dozens or hundreds or thousands of people that are going to be subjected to their signal (or more often, noise) before submitting.<p>And yes, I realize the hypocrisy of my statement after I just sat here and wrote about a thousand pages.

Unfortunately, we don't have any Starbucks, and I find the silence in libraries to be too loud for my taste.<p>I've found two ""eh"" coffee shops, but one's always crowded and has poor ventilation, and the other one cranks up the music as if to scare people into only buying take-away, while the coffee-grinder or blender makes it impossible to get anything done on the same floor.<p>I've actually considered doing a start-up coffee shop to address this very thing, but it's to big an undertaking at the moment. And I'd rather do it in a country that seems to respect that culture already, which renders the idea somewhat moot.",1303232686

The old telcos like Verizon, AT&T, etc see bandwidth as a limited resource that needs to be rationed.<p>Companies like Google in Kansas City sees bandwidth as being like a parking lot for a big box store, or a subway stop for a big-city department store -- a funnel to bring in customers.<p>I think the compromise lies in the middle -- you need a physical regulatory environment like Germany, where the actual conduits for public utilities are owned by the public. Then you have the companies compete on the value they bring to the table -- customer service, a better global network, price.",1303232648

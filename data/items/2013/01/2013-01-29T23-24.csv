Sure, there are more ""efficient"" data structures for use in functional styles now than there were in the past, but they all seem to treat memory as if it is free.

It's also keeping an eye out for reported vulnerabilities  and not all projects have dedicated security mailing lists. Not all projects even report this information via mailing lists.<p>I wish it were different. I understand where you're coming from. But the incentives are set up ass-backwards, and until companies start having serious liability for data breaches, protecting customer data simply isn't going to be a priority. In the meantime, encouraging them to set up their infrastructure in a way that requires even more ops effort when they're already struggling to keep up is going to have an adverse outcome.",1359501999

Back when I was in high school, I ran track.  My sister (in 8th grade at the time) was fast enough to have been 4th on the men's varsity team.  So people told her, wow, you're as good as a guy!  Did we value speed as a ""solely"" male attribute?  No, it was valued separately in its own classification (men and women race separately).  However, the fact that my sister was good enough to actually compete with the men (who are overall much faster than women), came across as a <i>compliment</i>.<p>I would go so far as to invoke ""isomorphic"" as the most apt term in describing the type of compliment involved in mine and scrapcode's scenarios.<p>> Taking attributes and ascribing them to gender is useless at best.<p>Useless at best?  I see this phrase a lot on the internet lately, and it must be a fad because it wasn't in popular usage a few years ago.<p>Men and women have different traits.  It is a completely, scientifically, <i>undeniable</i> fact.  Men <i>will</i> be better at certain skills, and women <i>will</i> be better at other skills.  The latest social trend cannot change that.<p>If a woman is good enough to play in the NFL, great for her, we'd all be glad to see that!  But that doesn't change the fact that the odds are ridiculously stacked against her being capable of doing such a thing.  Maybe start a separate women's NFL?  Alright, but since no one's done that, let's use common sense and say football is a man's sport.  What is an activity that's typically only associated with females only: ballet dancers.  Sure, there are male ballet dancers but until the ratio is close to 50/50, the term ""ballet dancer"" will continue to be associated with females, and for good reason.",1359501755

Instead, we spend our time liking pictures of cats on facebook, more resource-rich than ever, and that includes not only the golden billion but more remote locations too. Obviously, naive extrapolations don't work and haven't worked ever. Resource depletion is not a thing that is on immediate agenda. Of course, ""sooner or later"" our sun would explode or implode or whatever should happen to it and we'd better get off this planet by then. But given we're talking about timeframe much bigger than any experience of any civilization, we have no slightest idea what ""we"" would mean by then, if anything, so concerning about it seems useless now. While all these finiteness arguments are correct in principle, their practicality as for immediate agenda is not obvious, and rarely proven - usually it goes as ""resources are limited, population is growing, so we'll be out of resources eventually, so we better start making laws right now that do whatever my political persuasion instructs me to do"". It seems to me, the transition from theoretical limit to practical urgency needs to be proven first.<p>That doesn't mean simple efficiency of using resources - doing more with the same or less - shouldn't be on the agenda. On the contrary, this is the primary way of staying ahead of the game. But let's not panic and get into ""our golden age has passed, we're all screwed now"".

Oh god, she TOOK away jobs others should have had; it's not like she was given them, no no no, she <i>snatched</i> them with her decepta-claws, people were helpless against the might of photoshop. Instead of, say, people giving a fuck about who you know too much, and about what people supposedly did, more than they care (or even pay attention to) what people are saying or doing <i>this moment</i> causing those job mis-allocations, having caused them before that, and still being causing them. The in crowd is not the problem, faking membership is. It's a meritocracy, after all! You couldn't make this stuff up, really.<p>It's not like she became a brain surgeon or president under false pretenses, it was just some web crap, right? <i>Right?!</i> Just consider Bush and Mr. Hope & Change, and this quote, which is so depressingly accurate today as it probably was then: ""<i>We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office.</i>"" (Aesop) It's easy to bash a young girl who got caught, lost her job, is seeking counseling; that is the lowest hanging fruit there is. Sure, one doesn't exclude the other, and I'm not claiming anyone bashing her isn't also bashing other deception; but still, I call bollocks on this.<p>She got found out, she came clean, she basically only just started working on herself; what more do you want? Hopefully she'll find the strength (support is nice, inner strength is nicer) to open new doors for herself; she always missed out on being the same person on the inside as on the outside, so she has a lot of cool things to discover.. who wouldn't be happy for that? So to Mr. and Mrs. Snarky Pants I have to say something else Nietzsche said (about Christianity), something along the lines of something that crawls on the ground snatching at anything attempting to fly. It's just disgusting to flaunt Nietzsche to be petty and small-minded. That's some serious clown shit.<p>Remember the soul searching about Aaron asking for help on HN?

""You broke it, you own it"", ""I am not convinced until I really see anything, like, she has to contribute to open source and shit, and until then I'm going to be an ass"" -- yeah, right.

Interestingly, ursolic acid also increased brown fat, a tissue that shares developmental origins with skeletal muscle. Consistent with increased skeletal muscle and brown fat, ursolic acid increased energy expenditure, leading to reduced obesity, improved glucose tolerance and decreased hepatic steatosis.""<p>Patrick Arnold, the creator of ""The Clear"" and other designer steroids used by BALCO, currently produces an ursolic acid transdermal that many people claim to have been extremely effective for weight loss.",1359500512

If expectations are too high it's natural to be disappointed when growth is a trickle.  You want to compound users like you would an investment account.<p>I would service the piss out of every early user whether they explicitly ask for help or not.  If you have something to serve those early people and they are happy they will tell others over time and will become the initial customer support contact for the referrals.  Support demand won't necessarily be linear growth with user growth.<p>My preference is to bootstrap the core technology development as long as you can because you learn what you actually need as you go.  Not what you think you need.  Being very high hands-on with all early users will teach you how to build a passive customer service system or how to iterate your technology to fix common bottlenecks.<p>Once the core technology is in place and you've discovered a marketing niche that you can exploit at-scale, then, you consider taking money and investing it in user acquisition.<p>At the end of the day, it's all a speculation and you need to win some bets because you will lose plenty along the way.  ;)",1359500510

Thanks!<p>This brings out a point not explicitly mentioned in your original post. A key thing you get in college is access to people who know the topology of your field. It is a routine recommendation to start with TAPL. A map is invaluable in order to limit backtracking or dead ends.<p>In my field of reverse engineering, those who have produced the top public results are completely self taught. Advanced forms of reverse engineering require a large smattering of knowledge from many graduate level areas of Computer Science and Mathematics.  Autodidacticism of some form is the only option, whether it involves complete self-instruction or designing a custom curriculum in graduate school. The aforementioned authors have described the process of learning without a roadmap as extremely painful. If you don't <i>have</i> to subject yourself to it, I don't know why you would.",1359500484

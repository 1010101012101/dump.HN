(Often more than twice as quickly than working alone)<p>* One person is usually the driver (uses the keyboard) and the other the navigator. This means one person can keep in mind the overall picture of what they're building, all other parts of the codebase that need to be updated and so on, while the other person concentrates on the nitty gritty of implementing a specific method.<p>* You get distracted less easily (IRC, Twitter, HN, etc) when you're both working on something.<p>* You produce better quality code \n   - There's no temptation to cut corners when the other person is right there when you're writing it\n   - Your pair can help you stick to TDD properly\n   - Both people have insights into best way of writing things\n   - This means less time wasted refactoring later<p>This last point is why it is so much better than a code review process. Once the code is written there is a temptation to not have to go back and change it, especially for a major redesign that someone else spots. Changing things involves risk of introducing new bugs. There's also the risk of offending the person who wrote the code",1309459997

There might be paid apprenticeships that are priced out of the market by the minimum wage, but that's speculative.<p>The entire rest of your post is frankly nonsense--it's clear you've never actually learned anything about economics, because most economists concede that the minimum wage doesn't really do much to help anyone, and if anything, only increases unemployment.<p>History doesn't back you up on this--the 19th century was a materially poorer time in the sense that less wealth was being created to begin with. While large numbers of immigrants lived in poverty, they voluntarily chose to live in those conditions because it was the best opportunity they had. If there was a minimum wage above and beyond the value their labor could legitimately produce, they wouldn't have had that opportunity and they would have been materially even worse off. More to the point, there is <i>still</i> a permanent underclass of immigrants living in poverty and earning less than the minimum wage in this country. When the relevant wage and immigration laws are enforced on that population, the net effect is that they're forced to live in the impoverished countries they voluntarily chose to escape from.<p>As for the rest of us, our recourse is to legitimately generate more wealth than the cost of our wages and benefits so that we remain profitably employed.

While I can zip through chapters in Chris Pine's book, which teaches Ruby, I spend days working through each of the CS50 problem sets.<p>At the beginning, the biggest surprise was how hard it was. It sounds obvious, but programming is about thinking like a machine.

2715164,comment,2714270,2714970,13,0,dpark,,,"Artificially restricting themselves to only corporate and government users would be a terrible move.  They would still bear nearly 100% of their current costs, but have access to maybe 10 or 20% of their current market.  This is a recipe for disaster.  Being ""corp and govt only"" has no meaningful exclusivity.  It's not elite.  It's just bureaucratic.  No one lusts after overpriced government-contract devices.  And certainly very few people want to carry both a corporate and a personal phone.  Those who do will probably like the Blackberry less, as it becomes a symbol of inconvenience, and as it's constantly compared to their latest iOS/Android device<p>History has shown that general-use technology eventually wins over niche technology.  How many companies are running Alpha chips these days?  SGI workstations?  Sparc servers?  The niche players lost as the mainstream passed them by.  Intel processors ended up crushing the dedicated ""corporate"" processors, because the mainstream market could support larger R&D efforts and provided a volume that allowed a far superior price/performance ratio.  Ditto with nVidia.  This is a story that's played out the same way again and again.  The niche player loses unless it can deliver (and continue to deliver) significant value beyond what the mainstream players can provide.  No one cares if there's an ""elite"" status to owning a rack of Alpha processors when a rack of Pentium 3 chips can do the same job for a quarter of the price.<p>Also, Apple and Android are both making significant headway into the corporate environment, as employees tire of carrying two phones or being limited to a Blackberry device.  Even in companies where Blackberry is the only ""supported"" device, they often give employees access to Exchange on their personal devices.  If employees use their personal iPhones rather than receive a corp-provided Blackberry, that's a loss for RIM (and arguably a gain for the corporation, as they don't have to pick up the tab for another corp phone).",1309458375

The reputation for poor usability on the platform is I think driven more by designers treating it as a secondary platform than it is android being difficult to create good ui with. So many apps on the market feel like poorly thought through iPhone ports with explicit exit functionality, loss of state on exit/resume , soft buttons for things like search and back that exist as hard buttons, and glossy iPhone like interface that feels out of place.<p>The best bit of advice I thought was to actually get a device and spend time using it day to day before designing for it.

If you started at RIM in mid-late 90s as an Analyst, you would proress to Intermediate 6 months later, then Senior within another 8-12 months.  Within 2 years, you were a Supervisor/Team Lead and on and on it went.  Very few talented people wanted to live or commute to Waterloo during that time.  RIM hired who they could, gave away stock options, made employees wealthy and continued to promote them.As a result, the company is now top-heavy (VPs are almost numberless) primarily with people who had grown up in the system and have little external perspective.",1309457031

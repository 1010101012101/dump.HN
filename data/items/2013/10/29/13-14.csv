6634079,comment,6633413,6633758,1,0,bradleyland,,,"It might be. This is a compound attack. The attack makes a couple of assumptions that are dangerous for both iOS and Android:<p>1) The app communication is using HTTP.<p>2) The attacker has some means of executing a MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack.<p>The portion that appears to be unique to iOS (maybe it&#x27;s not), is the default cache policy for 301 redirects. Specifically, once the attacker has targeted some HTTP traffic, they use the MITM attack to redirect iOS to the attacker&#x27;s server instead of the intended one. The default cache policy on iOS makes this redirect more or less permanent. That&#x27;s bad because once you leave the compromised network, your phone will continue to talk to the attacker&#x27;s server instead of the intended one.<p>The reason this exploit is seeing such an apathetic response is because the cache poisoning is pretty lame in comparison to having executed a MITM scenario. Once you have MITM, you have complete control over the traffic a device receives. For HTTP communications, this is not specific to iOS devices.<p>The best mitigation for MITM attacks is to simply use HTTPS instead of HTTP. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not easy for iOS users to see whether an app is using secure back-end communications.",1383055087

It&#x27;s great because people who traditionally aren&#x27;t developers can get some JS snippet running to add something dynamic to a site, but at the same time if you are a developer who has spent time learning the language then you can do a lot more with it.<p>There are also alternatives to callback hell. I do take the method of naming functions instead of using a large number of anonymous functions. It helps significantly. If you prefer, you can easily use promises instead. That&#x27;s been another effective approach.<p>I&#x27;ve never written any Ruby and can&#x27;t speak to the comparison at all, but if it&#x27;s a language that makes it impossible to produce bad code when you don&#x27;t know the language and its idioms well then it&#x27;s something I need to be learning.",1383055045

The concept is not new, but basing the hiring decision on a week is at least somewhat novel.<p>I think the real hiring secret here is more around measuring a candidate&#x27;s interest in the company, and it seems a main hiring criteria is a willingness to show your dedication and &#x27;loyalty&#x27; to the company before being hired.  If the candidate wasn&#x27;t compensated, this is similar to a one week pledging for a fraternity or sorority, where the decision to hire/induct the applicant is verified by their willingness to participate in the process.<p>Would the company consider hiring anybody that was unable (work contract, family responsibility) or unwilling to go through this process?<p>Even though the company is paying candidates, taking a week of vacation time to audition is still a significant investment of time.  Most candidates in the industry are comfortable with the amount they earn, and many would sacrifice 2% of their salary for an extra week of vacation.<p>To prove this theory, as a recruiter I&#x27;ve had countless candidates try to negotiate lower salaries or benefits for additional PTO (or unpaid time off).  I have had exactly one candidate in my fifteen years that tried to negotiate a higher salary and less PTO.  The value of PTO is significant, and if industry pros are that hungry for cash then we should see more of them using their PTO to earn money (of course there are some who will).<p>In an ideal world, every candidate would have the free time to be able to vet their employer in this way also.  Working for a company for a week should help prevent some &#x27;bait and switch&#x27; tactics.<p>If you truly want to test your candidates&#x27; dedication and belief in your company before hiring, this is a good method to weed out people who might only be 99% committed.  Of course, it eliminates some strong talent as well, and unfortunately I&#x27;d suspect that the talent it eliminates in most cases is senior level with families.",1383055026

This usually plays out in feature selection, but may involve radical changes in the classifier/model design. The secondary ones are more fun and can more easily be the basis of a PhD. The initial ones are usually swept under the rug when they&#x27;re brutal and boring, though fundamental changes also form great PhDs.<p>I think it&#x27;s fairly clear that the success of NLP almost entirely came down to a feature engineering change.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the ideal Data Scientist/Statistician position is. I think it varies based on many of the implicit needs that only statistics savvy businesses can pick between clearly. The role may require strong programming skills, the ability to build and iterate massive multilevel models of social data, a familiarity on-line classifiers, the ability to graph things nicely in R and D3, the ability to from scratch write a non-linear optimizer over a completely novel space, a familiarity with NLTK, or, finally and perhaps most commonly, the ability to pander bullshit about the benefits of machine learning.<p>I love the field and that&#x27;s why I tend to side with the statisticians who want to really figure out what&#x27;s needed to do an objectively good job drawing inference from data. Many in the new generation of statisticians are quite successfully crossing the cultural divide. A smaller cohort are brushing up at least their R coding skills to a suitable degree.

Libraries are a place where web workers make a lot of sense, because the payoff for the extra work is multiplied by everyone who uses it. And as time goes on and JS libraries do more and more heavy lifting, it makes sense that they would benefit from multi-threading.<p>But that same thing works against a library developer when it comes to browser compatibility. It means you have to write a fallback, and that&#x27;s particularly annoying when it comes to web workers.<p>The other problem as I see it is that the model of not sharing memory makes it a lot trickier to squeeze performance out. A lot of situations that would benefit from multi-threading are situations where you&#x27;re processing a big chunk of data. If you have to copy those big chunks of data in and out of your worker, you sacrifice a lot of the performance you&#x27;re working so hard to achieve.<p>Transferable objects will help a lot with that, but that&#x27;s very new, and it will be even longer before you can just take it as a given.",1383054299

6633919,comment,6633091,6633091,18,0,Robin_Message,,,"So, I&#x27;m trying to work out how this actually works, and thought I&#x27;d share my working (especially the reversed bit counter). No idea if my thinking out loud will help anyone else.<p>TL;DR: Because we count reversed, when the table shrinks (shrinking is done live, so the old table sticks around for a while) we will continue to iterate only from the position in the sequence where all of the masked bit combinations (those bits of the hash that are ignored in the smaller table) have already been explored. If we counted normally, then on a shrink we would end up skipping parts of the old table. Lines <a href=""https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/dict.c#L717-L721"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/dict.c#L7...</a> explain it perfectly, now I understand it.<p>Looking at the code, the increment works as follows:<p><pre><code>    counter |= ~mask;\n    counter = reverse(counter);\n    counter++;\n    counter = reverse(counter);\n</code></pre>\nThe mask is the size of the hash table, minus one, so it always looks something like 0b00001111.<p>So the first step sets all the unimportant high bits. This means that, after the reverse, all of the unimportant low bits are set, which means an increment will set all of the unimportant bits to zero, and increment the important part of the reversed counter.<p>So this could be rewritten as:<p><pre><code>    counter = reverse(counter);\n    counter += (1 << (32-log_size));\n    counter = reverse(counter);\n</code></pre>\nSometimes a collection is made up of two tables, one larger, one smaller. There is an extra loop in each iteration to go through all of the elements of the larger table that share a hash prefix with the counter.<p>Now, why the reversed counter? If the table stays the same size, it doesn&#x27;t matter what order you iterate. If the table grows, the prefix system still works, so that can&#x27;t be it. So, by process of elimination, it must be necessary for collections that shrink.<p>Say we have an 8 element collection, and have iterated 000 and 100, and next is 010.\nThen it starts shrinking to a 4 element collection. So next is 010 (which is interpreted as 10 in the new, smaller table, and 010 and 110 in the old table), then 01 (01, 001, 101), then 11 (11, 011, 111), then done.<p>Well, that worked (we visited all 8 places in the old table). Let&#x27;s try a non-reverse increment.<p>000, 001. Next is 010.<p>Switch to size 4, and then visit (10,010,110), (11,011,111),  done. We missed 100 and 101.<p>Okay, I&#x27;m happy. It sort of makes intuitive sense that if the shrink is what&#x27;s important, and the high end is lost during the shrink, then incrementing from the high end will work better because throwing away the high end will still cover the whole range, as long as you still look at every bit in the thrown away section. Whereas incrementing from the low end will result in gaps.<p>Go from size 256 to 4 to really show it:<p><pre><code>    0,128,64,192|2,1,3,0\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    0,1,2,3|0 (which examines only the top quarter of the old hash table)\n</code></pre>\nOr to put it another way, look at this sequence: size 8: 0,4,2,6,1,5,3,7. The bottom bit is set only after all of the possiblities with the bottom bit reset have been explored. So if remove some of the top bits, either the bottom bits will not be set, or every combination of top bits with those bottom bits set will already have been explored.",1383053830

6633903,comment,6596038,6601300,2,0,devrelm,,,"I disagree that MVC is not well documented, but perhaps I&#x27;ve just learned where the good documentation is (for MVC.)<p>That said, I have to agree that every time I&#x27;ve dived into PHP/RoR, there have been plenty of articles with well-drawn maps of the minefield (to borrow your analogy.)<p>> Oh, and just for fun every 5 years or so MS deprecates that particular mine field, lays a new one, and forces everyone to go play in the new minefield instead.<p>I know I started at the beginning with this new minefield (MVC came out less than a year before I started using it,) but I don&#x27;t see this happening as much, at least not with MS&#x27;s web offerings. The last version or two of MVC and EntityFramework have been OSS under Apache 2, so they can continue to be developed even if MS decides to go a separate route.<p>I understand that this is not the case for their desktop and mobile offerings, and that they have jerked their developers in that field around in different directions each time they come out with a new OS. I think that their web offerings are more stable. The only things that may change fundamentally are server components (IIS, SQL Server, MVC, EF, etc.), or the browser. If the browser changes, everyone&#x27;s screwed; and if the server components change, the developer can simply decide to stay on older versions (until licenses run out, which I&#x27;ll concede as one problem.)<p>And of course, all this flows back to documentation. PHP/Python/RoR have much better documentation because they&#x27;re all much more widely used. If more people used MVC, more people would write about it, and there would be more documentation for it.<p>The only remaining issue is a pretty big one: cost. Yes, there&#x27;s a VS Express Web Edition, but that has its own issues. So, you&#x27;re left with BizSpark as the next best option. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done. I have 2 more years left before I have to decide whether to start paying. So far it&#x27;s great, but I know that it&#x27;s going to come back and bite me in the ass unless I start something profitable before then.<p>And I believe that that&#x27;s the real reason that it&#x27;s not more widely used; or at least the original reason, with lack of documentation and other MS-hate being secondary to and/or consequences of it. In a community where people have 5 ideas fail before hitting something profitable, it&#x27;s hard to justify the extra cost of $1000 or more per developer, even if it&#x27;s actually free for the first few years. Why risk paying $1000+ per developer and an extra $100+ per server 3 years from now, when you can start with something free and have it still be free 3 years from now? That&#x27;s what it all boils down to.<p>I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m probably tossing in the towel on MVC soon. But it&#x27;s not because of poor documentation or fear of being forced to switch to a new API requiring a large rewrite on my part. It&#x27;s because 1) the IDE and servers are 5-10x more expensive than those for Python/Ruby/Node/PHP; and 2) everybody&#x27;s using Python/Ruby/Node/PHP, so finding work is tough. After all, what good is working on a side project to show off my MVC skills, if nobody will hire me for it anyway?",1383053681

No company would be bragging about a 66% hire rate on all candidates, as that would show you are probably not very selective at all (assuming the applicants represent the industry as a whole).<p>They don&#x27;t provide data as to how many interviews they do before the invite, or what percentage of candidates are invited to participate in trial week.  I&#x27;d imagine that, if this company is truly selective, the percentage of candidates invited to trial week is rather low - well below 50%, probably closer to 10%.<p>If they are hiring 66% of the candidates that make it through trial week, and only 5% of candidates are rejecting the opportunity for a trial week, then how much value does the trial week actually add?  One could argue that the cost of wasting an entire week with the 34% of candidates that you aren&#x27;t going to hire is substantial (while most here could argue that you could end up getting some great ideas on the process out of that candidate even if you don&#x27;t hire him/her).<p>And who is to say that the 34% wouldn&#x27;t have worked out in the long run?  They provide an anecdote about a candidate that didn&#x27;t handle interview pressure well but did great during trial week.  Couldn&#x27;t at least some percentage of the 34% that are rejected perhaps feel that same pressure in trial week, and could do well when the guise of an audition is no longer present?<p>But if you have a 66% positive rate on trial week, it seems the main purpose it serves is to just verify what you already know - that you want to hire this person.  But it also serves, perhaps, a more important purpose as well.<p>What I think is the true secret sauce here is the concept related to the willingness of candidates to participate in the process.  One of the hiring criteria is a clear interest in the company and a belief in the product.  If someone is willing to jump through this kind of hoop at the chance to work for this company, they are either very interested in the company or desperate for any job.  That 5% that reject the trial week can be deemed not a fit, due to their unwillingness to jump through this hoop.",1383053024

AppleCare sends me to Genius Bar to get it fixed. &quot;Genius&quot; reinstalls the OS and tells me it&#x27;s fixed. After disagreeing that this was a fix--when I started seeing the problem I tried clean reinstall--they run their memory test which doesn&#x27;t catch the issue, and tell me they won&#x27;t fix.<p>At this point I offer to pay out of pocket for a new logic board even though I am covered under AppleCare. 3 days after first calling Apple, I just want my machine working. They tell me they won&#x27;t even do that unless their iMemoryTester comes back with an error. So, they offer to mail it to a repair facility to see if they can figure out what&#x27;s wrong. So, I&#x27;m now into a process that they tell me will take an additional 5 days, and they may still elect to not fix the problem unless they can reproduce a problem that is intermittent in the OS and is reliably flagged by memtest86.<p>I used to believe that a laptop and AppleCare was a way to have a worry-free three-year cycle.

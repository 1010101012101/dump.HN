9456418,comment,9454670,9456188,0,0,muhbitplanes,,,"The NES has separate address spaces for the CPU and PPU. Part of each is mapped to internal memory and IO registers, with the rest available for the cartridge to do whatever it wants with. The PPU doesn&#x27;t care if you map RAM (&quot;CHR-RAM&quot;) or ROM (&quot;CHR-ROM&quot;) into its address space for holding graphics, it just reads whatever is there, so both are commonly used in games. The IO registers used to update tile and palette indices in the &quot;nametable&quot; can access any part of the PPU&#x27;s address space, so in a CHR-RAM cart, they would also be used to fill the CHR-RAM with graphics. In this case, you absolutely could use any compression scheme you want (within reason) to compress the graphics stored in PRG-ROM. Of course, with a CHR-ROM cart, you&#x27;d be limited to storing uncompressed tiles in the CHR-ROM.<p>NES games are interesting because there&#x27;s such a variety of hardware in the cartridges and techniques to make the most of it. There are games with huge PRG (CPU-visible) ROMs that stream data into CHR-RAM. There are games with huge CHR-ROMs and mapping hardware for granting fast, fine-grained access to more tile memory than would fit into the PPU&#x27;s address space. There are games that store level data in unused CHR-ROM, and even a few (IIRC) that store game variables in unused CHR-RAM! Programmers made the most of whatever hardware was cheaply available to them.",1430279753

The first time, I used a demo account at their Enterprise service level and compared it to our existing CDN (Akamai).  Our page load times increased across the board.  When I asked them about implementing the L7 customizations that we have in our Akamai setup, I was told that it would take custom development and that we would have to pay for it--stuff that we were able to implement at Akamai using their XML configuration.   Akamai is not an awesome company to work with and the XML configuration format is a nightmare but the service is fast and we didn&#x27;t need custom dev work to get it running.<p>The second time I tried Cloudflare was a few months ago for a personal project.  I run a moderately popular vBulletin forum in my spare time and I wanted to see if CF could speed up my site.  The results were similar--Cloudflare actually slowed things down.   I was at the free tier and perhaps I would have seen improvement at the $200/mo plan with Railgun but I wasn&#x27;t going to waste any more time to find out.<p>The nail in the coffin was when I discovered that they provided CDN services to ISIS propaganda sites and openly oppose any efforts to shut down the sites.

This means that you have flexibility to require a personal user&#x27;s ssh agent to be present for access to some things, or an identity file (optionally encrypted) stored on the server for less-sensitive things.  In the case of things that need to happen unattended, we use an in-the-clear identity file, which might seem a little counterintuitive since security-wise, it&#x27;s basically equivalent to just having the secret sitting there, but the indirection adds ease of rotating secrets along with revocability if we were to suspect we lost control of such a machine.  But for most of our secrets, we tie them to individual user&#x27;s identities which must be forwarded via an agent.  We consider this an acceptable constraint because deployment and app restarts are always driven by a human in our operations.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect system or a panacea, but it&#x27;s far better than having a bunch of passwords directly stored in config files, in my opinion.  We also have a wrapper tool that uses your SSH agent access to fetch secrets for the mysql suite of tools as needed, so nobody is ever tempted to create a personal .my.cnf on prod servers.  Anybody who actually has access to a given mysql password is still on the honor system not to fetch it and write it down somewhere, but removing the need to ever even see them eliminates the temptation to put it in a .my.cnf or in your clipboard, which eliminates a whole class of mistakes you can make in handling them.",1430279016

9456371,comment,9453381,9455662,0,0,NateDad,,,"The thing is, implicit interfaces give you so much freedom and make it so easy to keep your code decoupled, that the very rare times that you hit something like this Next() problem, you just work around it and accept it as a cost for all the other benefits it brings.<p>For the record, in Juju we have hundreds of interfaces and hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and AFAIK have never had this be a problem.<p>For the given Next problem, you can easily make a wrapper type that simply masks the underlying Next() method with its own implementation.<p><pre><code>    type MyType struct {}
    func (m *MyType) Next(i int) {
        // do base next stuff
    }

    type ForSql struct {
        *MyType
    }
    func (f ForSql) Next() bool {
        // do sql-next stuff
    }
</code></pre>
and then using this type is trivial in-code:<p><pre><code>    mt := &MyType{}
    doSomeSqlThing(ForSql{mt})
</code></pre>
Note that this new type retains all the methods of the original type, so it still implements all the interfaces it used to (unless they rely on the old Next signature).<p>Compare this to the benefits of implicit interfaces (decoupled code, easy composition, using third party code as your own interface type without needing a wrapper type)... hopefully it&#x27;s pretty obvious this is a large net positive.",1430278900

9456346,comment,9454558,9454558,0,0,jbdigriz,,,"After reading this article and some of the comments, its completely clear that Apple has undeniably triggered almost the exact same effects on some people as the most addictive drugs known to mankind. It&#x27;s almost mind boggling to consider but I would go a step further to say this is likely the same effect reflected in Apple&#x27;s recently announced profits - much like a drug kingpin entering the market with his highly addictive product would experience (ie. Crack cocaine in the 80s). It&#x27;s truly beyond anything I could imagine and honestly scares the shit out of me.<p>The problem in such scenarios is that reason and logic become completely irrelevant - the addict falls under the trance of the drug and short of keeping them physically separated from said chemical in order to let the body clear itself of its influence and effects, few have the will to come back from the depths - and the end result is almost always painfully tragic. It&#x27;s so tragic that society ends up going to the opposite extreme and attempts to ban nearly any mind altering chemical - that is how fearful the collective sentiment is and if the war on drugs is any precedent, it can last four decades and ultimately ruin even more lives than the drug itself.<p>I read this article and I really felt I had been directed towards a satirical article from the likes of The Onion or Clickhole. I am NOT trying to be overly emphatic or derogatory - it just seems like the first time a brand and their line of material products seems to have such a deep rooted hold on its customers. Sure, there are always fads which have a momentary grasp over their customers: Tickle me Elmo, Furbies, various pop artists, etc. But those always seemed to follow the same trajectory and never indicated any lasting effect. But this is clearly very different.<p>Think about this piece for a moment and the clearly Apple supportive writer and website. On one hand, he had the sensibility to write the article and even put the almost satirical title on it. That&#x27;s probably a good sign. Also good is the factual recounting of the brand&#x27;s position and justification of such. Reason seems to still have a far deeper rooted presence in this person&#x27;s being than the brand does. But in much the same way an addict or a victim of domestic abuse reacts upon the possibility of losing said target of addiction, it quickly devolves into justifications and ultimately acceptance of such a completely untenable prospective future. Though there is certainly some sarcasm in the few commentators here, it&#x27;s clear their sentiments and perceptions follow the same trajectory.<p>Again, I apologize and don&#x27;t mean to insult or belittle, my argument is my true and honest opinion. So I must ask - is it me? So disconcerting is this notion that I&#x27;m compelled to ask if perhaps I&#x27;M the crazy one. Because I read this article and see that a company has produced a product precisely to resemble a watch in every way and even includes such in the name but then makes a draconian move to deny third parties willing to do so the ability to distribute software producing A WATCH FACE for said watch (likely thousands with no desire to even make a profit). Is this real? Am I hallucinating??? I struggle to come up with any reasonable scenario where this is a move to prevent competition, which would also be highly disturbing but not in the least surprising, especially considering the brand in question. It&#x27;s simply some form of an arbitrary egomaniacal move which defies rational belief to those not completely consumed and ultimately entranced with any position held by some perceived &#x27;god&#x27; or &#x27;god-like&#x27; object (need to confirm I&#x27;m not the only one before fully backing this statement). But it&#x27;s bizarre and the potential is as unsettling as the actual result in front of me - the same as if Apple produced the Apple Cat and then immediately barred anyone from calling our treating it as a cat while simultaneously making it appear as a dog and requiring all customers assimilate and accept the same. And the response being, &quot;Yeah, I think it&#x27;s their right to do this - I mean, it&#x27;s not a REAL cat anyway, so why not call the Apple Cat a DOG..I mean it&#x27;s Apple afterall, right ;)&quot;. Yes - it&#x27;s Apple, the company who indirectly employs factories with such inhuman work schedules that they need to install nets to catch the numerous employees jumping from the roof to end their torture; Apple, who while hoarding tens of billions in stockpiled profits uses all its might to prevent potential extra costs by clearly colluding with and/or threatening competitors from &quot;poaching&quot; talent interested in reclaiming their souls and free thought by leaving - even for ex-employees years departed from their empire of misery. Holy hell, where am I and how did I get here?!?<p>There are a number of anecdotes describing the Microsoft antitrust investigations years ago. I recall one description of the completely defiant and confrontational tone of Mr. Gates during these times and his unflinchingly complete denial of any possibility of such a concept. There is some room for debate, but I can&#x27;t imagine a rational person would see such accusations as completely baseless, especially when presented with evidence of clear internal communications showing not only obvious actions to suppress competition, but purposeful intent and rhetoric to this regard. I remember thinking then that this was delusion personified - someone so desperately self identifying with his creation that to accept such condemnation would be to accept condemnation of himself. It happens and perhaps at some point, to all of us. But the normal progression ultimately leads to a snap back to reality (thankfully the case with Mr. Gates - at least as far as one can tell from his undeniable and profound generosity). And ultimately a nostalgic look back at how entranced one had been as almost unbelievable - from the comfort of rational thought. So here&#x27;s hoping the spell is broken and those held captive by their obsessive enchantment come back to reality because we really need you here.<p>Otherwise, if you&#x27;re out there, Morpheus - I desperately need a red pill",1430278345

The trial is usually implemented by having a &quot;lite&quot; version downloaded, with an IAP to unlock the real version.<p>Fair; I don&#x27;t think I articulated that well enough. My distinction between the two was a trial would allow me to test the app before paying one fee for unlocking everything whereas I always see IAP are being multiple items I have to pay for.

Likewise for what you mean by functions and so forth. Then you could say somethinhg like, &quot;Siri, double the value before you pass it to the function, then take what it returns and if it is greater than zero....&quot;<p>and it should be able to make some guesses as to which C++ block you meant.  (i.e. present you 4-8 variations or interactively ask you, &quot;Did you mean if the first value is greater than zero, or if the value the function returns is greater than zero?&quot; Then after all that your impromptu session is not saved, only the one you ended up selecting is.<p>It&#x27;s sort-of like Googling for code, but with the difference that the machine makes all sorts of different guesses, and you just pick the one you mean.

That's a good point.<p>I have no idea what Stage6 offered, but I find it hard to believe that they wouldn't be able to get (more) funding if they had passionate users and dramatic growth.<p>Making money is, of course, another can of worms.  I could start a business of sending everyone $100 (for free) and I'd see a lot of love and growth.  Maybe that's what Stage6 did?  If they can't make the argument that scale can get their total cost down enough that $2.50 CPM could support it, then they are ""buying love"", no?",1205085538

But if they live in a cold state they NEED heat, which will require natural gas, electricity, coal/wood stove, or solar power -- or some other type of fuel (i.e. hydrogen, nuclear, etc.)<p>Maybe because everybody is only thinking technology applications, it makes sense, but I think the focus on ""what people want"" is a little misleading.<p>Think of the products you use and consume daily, and you will see there is a certain quantity that you need but may not want or like, and a certain quantity that you want, but may not need or be able to afford.<p>Creating something people want, although great advice, is not the end-all and be-all of startup advice.<p>Ditto for never giving up.<p>Read this: <a href=""http://www.theintellectualviewpoint.com/reading/thecommondenominatorofsuccess-albertengray.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theintellectualviewpoint.com/reading/thecommonden...</a><p>Sometimes, it's not just never giving up, but it's also doing the RIGHT things.",1205084911

Somebody correct me if I'm mistaken but I've understood that's exactly what they do at Google. Due to their scaling, self-replicating, and dynamic architecture, they figured out that it's cheaper to just let the boxes fry and replace them rather than trying to maintain and service their gazillion servers. I don't know how many boxes they replace each day but I'd guess it's routine.",1205084898

Your goal is not to be better than someone, but to do good research. If you feel the need to take drugs and you're willing to take its risks, then by all means do. It's not cheating.<p>Now, requiring people to use substances that might be bad for them is not a good idea. People have to have the freedom to choose if they will take those substances or not. Neither should be mandatory. The reason for this is that we want people to be able to make their own decisions and do whatever pleases them the most; may it be using drugs or not.",1205083873
132566,comment,132538,132538,0,0,lisper,,,"From first principles, actively looking for such a person is IMO a major mistake.  You are essentially looking for someone to invest in your company, but to buy their shares with labor instead of cash.  So you need someone who is 1) financially able to make such an investment, 2) a savvy enough investor to be able to assess whether or not your company is worth investing in (or foolish enough to make the investment without due diligence) and 3) able (and willing) to program.  Such a mix of skills and financial means is very rare.<p>This is not to say that if you should happen to be lucky enough to find such a person that you should not hire them, but actively looking is not wise.  Division of labor is a very powerful tool and should not be discarded lightly.  You're much more likely to succeed if you get investors to invest and hackers to hack and not try to fram these two disparate skills into one brain.<p>IMHO, YMMV, etc.",1205083789

Bridging the gap between digital and analog is not a bad strategy if you can bring all the advantages of digital along with it.<p>2. Already their UI lets you queue up letters to send, schedule letters for particular days, save drafts, etc.<p>3. It could track more metadata in the digital world, i.e. all sorts of other mechanisms like custom fields/notes to help you track these against customer problem numbers or account numbers at a business. Automatically support using a Google Doc, etc.<p>4. I suppose an API to tie it into your own applications could be pretty nifty. Especially if they get to the point of allowing businesses to get more bulk mailing options that are much cheaper than $1 a letter.<p>5. As I mentioned earlier, add support for a community of user-generated content of greeting cards that can be voted/upvoted,<p>6. Add support for viral/political/consumerist letter templates that can be shared/embedded. Provide a link and let people pile onto a letter-writing campaign. It might look like astroturf, but could allow people to at least scribble an electronic signature.<p>Lots of potential here. Just need to follow through.

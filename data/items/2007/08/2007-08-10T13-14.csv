41240,comment,40993,41186,0,0,Goladus,,,"Personally I'd recommend ""deeper"" (if possible) and ""more relaxed"" before ""louder.""  At least, that is what you want for an English-speaking audience.  If you're loud but your voice is nasal or shrill then you may have the opposite effect.<p>A deep, relaxed, resonant voice conveys the assurance and confidence you're looking for.  People associate it with maturity, wisdom, and masculinity (Think Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones).  People associate a shallow, shrill, nasal voice with a whining child.  Most people can also recognize tension unconsciously.<p>The key to speaking with resonance is slow, relaxed, deep breathing (sort of like Yoga breathing).  This has the nice side effect of helping you stay relaxed.",1186754099

I refuse to keep up with 2+ social networking sites, its a waste of time!<p>If I could push/pull content thru one site, I'd be more likely to use social networking sites more.<p>2. Internet TV = <a href=""http://tvlinks.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tvlinks.co.uk</a> if the DVR missed a show or I  discover a new series mid-season.  I like amateur stuff like YouTube but usually get links to it from friends & other sources, never get content thru their portal.<p>3. I've accepted that online news is a moving target, and the best I can do is keep my feedlist short and relevant to what I'm currently interested in.  Social news sites are like bright burning stars that collapse under their own weight as they grow more massive.  I agree, Digg is dead, Reddit may be dying...  YC News is cool because its still small.",1186752492

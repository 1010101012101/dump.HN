4691904,comment,4690262,4690262,1,0,hboon,,,"Here's something I've been doing for the past 3 years ago since I've gone indie.<p>I have a text file which I keep open in vim, called ""wip"" which I have loose sections of content. Let's call them section 1, section 2 and section 3.<p>I list TODOs which I want to accomplish recently in section 3. When I start working on an item, I might expand on it and add additional sub-items, indented. I mark items I'm working on with a ""@"" and when they are finished, with a ""<i>"". Sometimes I'm on several items at the same time (too many is not a good sign), I will add a few @@@@ to the start of a line I'm </i>really* on, no biggie.<p>I mentally group my items into projects/types of activities like Project1, Project2. Each time I start working on Project1, I add a new line which says Project1 and the start time to section 2. When I stop working with Project1, I add the end time to that line.<p>Every morning, I run a little script which scans through section 2 in ""wip"" and extract out the time I spent on each project and inserts that at the bottom of section 2. I then copy section 2 and section 3 of ""wip"" into a new file giving yesterday's date as the filename. Then I go into ""wip"" and remove all the items marked with ""<i>"" as well as section 2 and then copy section 1 into section 3 as well. Section 3 contains things that I want to do daily, such as stretch myself in the morning or to manually check if a specific service is up (enough till I automate them or build a habit out of it).<p>A great side-effect  the files that are created everyday becomes my work log. I can run scripts to generate how much time I've spent on a specific project or how much time I've work in a given year.<p>My wip file looks like:<p>section 1 - template TODOs<p>section 2 - projects and their start-end time<p>section 3 - TODOs (each like might start with a @ or </i> and might be indented to various levels, seldom more than 2-3 levels). I don't keep the entire project here.",1351061883

4691893,comment,4691680,4691811,3,0,AngryParsley,,,"I agree. In addition to the concerns you brought up, I see other issues with Pike's proposal. If computers are infrastructure, I'm forced to deal with whatever computers others have. This is a problem, because most people don't use computers as much as me and aren't willing to spend as much on them. I'd rather carry a maxed-out 11"" Air everywhere than put up with my friends' and relatives' computers. (In fact, I do this.)<p>Pike doesn't address security either. Would you log into Gmail on a public computer? Would you enter your credit card info or visit your bank's website? I sure wouldn't. Phones from 20 years ago didn't have any storage or computational abilities, so these security concerns didn't exist for them.<p>While I'm a huge fan of cloud-based storage and synchronization, there are just too many issues with using untrusted computers everywhere I go.

Those are trivial to scale, in minor orders.  The micro cost is in the acquisition of <unique> bit sets. In your example, its not the cost to send or replicate the e-mail with a 2 mb attachment.  Its the cost to acquire, verify, etc the contetents of the 2mb file have any value. [1]<p>You can't create more <valuable> data per-se by making X copies of the same data (in the sense of it having value for marketing/analytics). that is just monetizing existing data. ie, The marginal cost to relicate a set, provided it was given to you for free...just assumes away a non-trivial part of the equation....getting the data.<p>At scales of 100m to a 1Billion...is not trivial or costless.  Lastly, if you only have one set of data (say 5m users of data), that is a finite supply. You could have 2 sets (10m users).  Thats not the same as having 2 copies of 1 set (of 5 million). A customer might pay per user for a lead, but wont pay twice for two copies of the same info. now, if somebody shows up with 100s million, it might impact supply/demand (depending on comparabilit/uniquenss). But those differences cannot be assumed away at zero cost, imho.  Hope this make more sense, was not trying to argue just for the sake of it.<p>________________<p>[1]  That scales with data entry, etc (if nothing else) at the origin (ie, this is a FB user cost == per user).

I think that's fundamentally wrong - while the new environment isn't really separate from existing Windows it's imo misleading to think of it as a ""thin upper layer"", because developing it involved making deeper changes & refactorings to every layer of the system (ARM support, window hardening, MoCOM, PLM, app model, async, etc.)<p>* see, not only does his ignorance lead taking jabs at MSFT that don't make sense, it leads to him missing out on potential avenues of attack that WOULD make sense - he could make fun of the ridiculous UI framework fragmentation problem Microsoft has, which is an area where Apple actually has its shit together and has for some time.",1351060329

The motherboard makers already have entire product lines of extremely niche products (see the x79 chipset) and sata disks / DDR memory are used in mobile devices, just at different form factors.  They still need wireless / usb controllers, maybe the cases get more expensive?<p>Point is, the two markets are very tightly coupled, and there is a diverse enough pc component market that consumer demand dropping doesn't phase it <i>too</i> much.

Both offer writeback and writethrough caching, but they differ in their policies for what kind of I/O skips the cache. Bcache tries to detect sequential I/O and send that straight to the backing disk, and organizes the I/Os sent to the SSD in a manner that tries to go easy on the SSD's wear leveling and garbage collection algorithms.

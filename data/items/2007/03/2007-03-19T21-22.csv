5067,comment,5025,5060,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"It's a good point about spending.  I live in Atlanta but have had clients in Los Angeles.  I almost opened an office for a former employer in LA, and my analysis showed that housing was my only big additional cost.  If I had arranged for rental housing through my employer it would have been cool.",1174339534

Nokia tried to make a software program that would let you find your friends, and they could only make it work on seven or eight of their OWN phones. Yahoo has search software that works on many models of phones, but they also have 100 hackers employed to work full time on just that. You won't have 100 people.<p>2) The cell phone carriers turn off parts of the bluetooth spectrum to prevent people from downloading their own ringtones. This also prevents people from using your software if it needs bluetooth.<p>3) Cell phone carriers will never partner with you. At least not on terms that allow you to make a profit.<p>4) Even if one cell phone carrier partners with you, the rest won't.<p>5) Any software that takes advantage of the phone feature will drain the battery very fast. If you need to ping the cell tower ever five minutes, that means you have to recharge the phone every two hours. Which essentially means the phone is now worthless for making calls.<p>6) Most people don't know how to load software onto their cellphone, even if they were willing to pay for it.<p>7) Even if you can get some people using your software on their phone, to everyone else it will just look like they are sending text messages. If no one can see others using your software then it isn't viral and it won't spread.<p>8) Cell phones don't fit into the pockets of girls pants. (This is actually a serious problems)<p>9) There have been hundreds of entrepreneurs who have gone into mobile, and they have all failed. I can name two dozen companies that have tried to do social networking over cell phones. It's clearly something people want, but none have been able to release a decent product for the reasons above.<p>10) The next generation of WiFi will make probably make your product obsolete in two years anyway.",1174339465

5060,comment,5025,5025,0,0,paul,,,"Cost of living is kind of misleading because it depends a lot on how you spend money. The biggest difference is housing, but other things, such as cars, are nearly the same. If you're ok living in a little apartment for now, then the difference isn't as big as it sounds. (so if you live cheaply, then you should actually be able to save more in one of the high cost/pay cities)<p>To me, the more important issues are quality of life and quality of work. There's no way that I'd want to live or work in Houston, even if the housing is really cheap.",1174338281

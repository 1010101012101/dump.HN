They just bought it though; wait a couple years and they may reconsider.<p>BTW, those of us who follow the financial news are laughing because Daimler (the previous owner) literally <i>paid</i> Cerberus to take Chrysler off its hands.  The purchase price was nominally $7.4B, but it was structured as an investment into Chrysler itself.  In other words, Cerberus ""bought"" Chrysler by putting cash into a business it now owns, effectively paying itself.  In addition to that, Daimler <i>paid</i> Cerberus $650M in cash.  Yes, that's the seller giving money to the buyer.<p>The reason for this is that Chrysler is currently worth less than nothing.  Daimler's earnings are up $1.5B since getting rid of it, and Cerberus took on Chrysler's $18B of pension obligations.  Cerberus probably figures that it can renegotiate with the UAW and default on Chrysler's pension plan, which'll help return it to profitability.  Daimler couldn't do this because its profitable Mercedes division was effectively subsidizing workers in Detroit, costing it bargaining power in any attempt to stiff the unions.",1191362392

My book on the web was getting 30,000 pageviews a day when it was first published...and these days it gets about 100,000 per month in its current wiki form four years later (about 1000 visitors per day and slowly climbing).  And it's not at all Web 2.0 or constantly new.  Our business website even gets 100k page views per month (similarly, 1000-1500 visitors per day), and we definitely don't consider that a triumph.<p>I'm not begrudging him success with Truemors.  I, unlike a lot of folks here, think very highly of Kawasaki.  I found his books inspiring and occasionally educational, and his Art of the Start presentation is awesome.  But I think it's too early to call it a success at 150k page views per month...the 250k users thing doesn't quite gibe with the 150k page views...that would mean that almost no one EVER comes back to Truemors after their first visit, which is a very bad thing.",1191359759

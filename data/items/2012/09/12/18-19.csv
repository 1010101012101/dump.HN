4512388,comment,4509959,4511357,2,0,knwang,,,">>  My point is that this is a Chinese national who lives in China and has actually worked at the plant. Regardless of journalistic pedigree, the writer is vastly more capable of writing an honest story from the Chinese perspective than a Western journalist or the OP.<p>I actually agree. What I wanted to point out is for the reader of the story to keep in mind that the writer is a white collar Shanghai journalist, and would inevitably come with his frame of references because of it. For a NYT journalist living in NY, I believe most Western readers will assume a liberal bias, and view the reporting through some lenses, but the sophistication towards China probably stops at the reporter being a ""Chinese Journalist"".<p>Sure, the writer is more qualified than you and me, but he didn't answer some critical questions - is this factory above or below average in Chinese manufacturing plants? Is Foxconn raising or lowering labor standards in the area? Is Foxconn providing better alternatives to local labor, who may have to make a living by going down a tunnel in a coal mine or planting rice under the sun? Is having the plant there better or worth than not having the plant there?",1347476394

But I feel that he's not appreciating the value of informal conversation enough.<p>First of all, depression is characterized by people who have distorted thinking about themselves and rationalizations for avoiding treatment. So that discussion is going to be necessary to have.<p>Secondly, it's reasonable to be skeptical about psychiatry and self-help books. The industry is saturated with snake oil. One has to rely on one's own judgment or one would be endlessly drowning in research. Judging books by their cover isn't just appropriate, it's mandatory.<p>Sometimes literally. One of the best-selling self-help books for CBT depicts a guy with a lobotomized smile floating in a dreamy cloudscape with the title ""Feeling Good"".[1] When it was prescribed to me I was <i>disgusted</i>. It looks like Stuart Smalley.[2]<p>But people who made the same mistake were corrected by others who had read research, or had personal knowledge. Which leads me to my last point: head-butting has its place. In the wild, animals who butt heads are doing so to determine which is the stronger, without actually engaging in wasteful combat. Similarly we are often arguing to probe which argument might be better, without fully testing it. It's enough, sometimes, to sense someone's confidence, to see a glimpse of the detail of their knowledge, even if they don't cite anything.<p>That heuristic is highly exploitable by people who have abnormal abilities to project confidence (aka, ""confidence men""). But it's all we've got in a world that none of us have time to fully investigate.<p>At the very least, in that discussion, I hope people learned they couldn't just dismiss CBT out of hand; intelligent and experienced people had decent arguments for it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0452281326"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://schlegelrock.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/stuart-smalley-on-snl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schlegelrock.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/stuart-sm...</a>",1347476180

QA is an <i>effort</i>, not a <i>role</i>.<p>The key part of continuous delivery is that the safest change to make to a stable system is the smallest change possible.<p>So instead of batching up lots and lots of stuff and throwing it over the wall to QA, you make one change, have humans and robots test it, and deploy that change. The mindset shifts from ""features per release"" to ""releases per feature"" so with truly friction-less automated deployments, you can release very small changes individually. You don't have to test <i>everything</i> in order to change <i>anything</i>.<p>As you may expect, multiple layers of test automation are necessary. Each change runs a gauntlet of different kinds of tests before release. A set of ""safe to run in production"" tests immediately after release. Rollbacks are trivial, but exceedingly rare.<p>Obviously, this only works in some contexts. If you're pressing things onto gold master DVDs and shipping them in boxes, the QA effort will be more traditional.",1347476163

4512360,comment,4502383,4508848,1,0,wam,,,"I hadn't seen that video, thank you! That's an excellent analysis.<p>On the subject of policing strategies, my feeling is that the relative newness of internet-distributed mobs (and less mobbish but still easily-formed groups) could be a significant factor in the rise in warrantless wiretapping that we're seeing in the U.S. The police recognize that this is a new problem, but they don't have precise strategies to deal with it, so they're left with an imprecise one, which is ubiquitous surveillance. If it's very hard to target individual contributors, you want to cast as wide a net as possible and then sort them out later. My hope would be that strategies for dealing with this will be refined with time and we'll be able to reign in the surveillance too, which has already done a lot of damage.<p>That's just a hypothesis and it might be refuted by actual cases where members of anonymous groups have been arrested. But the most recent overreaching in U.S. government surveillance does seem to roughly correlate with the increased ease of anonymous group formation.<p>Well, that or fear of terrorism. It strikes me that destructive 4chan campaigns are an inversion of ""terrorism"" as it's usually defined. With a terrorist cell you have a small group of people trying to intimidate a much larger group through extreme but limited acts. In an internet campaign like this one, you have a large group of people trying to intimidate one person through a collection of acts which might be fairly innocuous if it were only a single person doing one of them once. The large power imbalance is still there, but turned on its head.<p>In any case, better strategies to catch up with technology aren't going to solve the basic moral problem, which is how to assign appropriate culpability to individuals who each barely participate in a leaderless action that is massively destructive in aggregate.",1347476144

Others try to wave their hands around pricing and just use a ""pay it later"" approach, but we'd rather keep things simple.

4512220,comment,4511188,4511188,22,0,moistgorilla,,,"Thank you for posting this. I have been mildly depressed for the last 8 years. I thought that depression medications and therapy were bogus and I never considered getting help. Mental Illness is such a sensitive issue and there is this belief out there that if you take anti-depressants and do therapy you are being scammed and you are weak. I believed all of this until I had a major depressive episode. I would be sitting in the middle of a lecture and all of a sudden a pain began to grow in my forehead. It was the feeling of wanting to cry but not being able to and the pressure concentrating at a point in the middle of my head. This happened for hours 4 or 5 times a week. After the 4th time I contemplated ending my life I went to my school counselling\ncenter. The therapist I saw convinced me to start taking medication and to see her once a week. This was possibly the best decision I have ever made.  The medication gave me the boost I needed to actually be receptive to what the therapist was telling me and the therapist helped me change ways of thinking that got me into this mess.<p>An example: I used to tell my therapist that whenever I was in a social gathering I felt as if I was getting negative reactions from everyone and that I wasn't wanted. Keep in mind, these people invited me to be with them, I didn't tag on.<p>The main problem with this thought pattern was that you can't ""feel"" that you are getting a negative reaction. You believe you are getting a negative reaction. I logically understand that I'm not a psychic. I do not know what these people are thinking, yet I believe they don't like me, even though they are inviting me to hang out with them. That doesn't make sense does it.<p>This is just one example of many.<p>As for the medication, it worked wonders. I had to try out different types however. The first medication I tried was welbutrin. It worked at first, I actually though about happy things. Probably something most take for granted but it felt like night and day for me. After going up in dosage however it made me feel more like a machine. Then I switched to prozac and have been going strong since. Prozac is working much better for me. I feel normal. Not sad, not necessarily happy all the time, but I am not having extreme pain inducing headaches 5 times a week for hours on end.<p>One of the ways my therapist framed using medication to me was that if I wasn't depressed the medication wouldn't work first of all. It doesn't magically make you happy. Also, if you are actually depressed, you have extremely low amounts of certain chemicals in your brain that are necessary to properly function. So it's not like you don't have an actual ailment that requires treating.<p>Also, to those that claim that you can get better from depression by eating better, excersize and sleeping. It's very difficult to put in that sort of effort when you can't get out of bed.<p>To add: The main thing I want people to get out of this is that we need to remove this negative attitude towards getting treatment for things like depression. I imagine a ton of people that would have gotten help if they weren't afraid of being perceived as weak especially to themselves. Cognitive therapy wont work if you go into a session and expect nothing out of it and are completely uncooperative.",1347474836

This way is akin to the ""cheap printer and expensive ink"" paradigm, or the ""cheap airfare but you have to pay all the taxes and fees separately"" paradigm.

People who train themselves to see only the positive are happier than those that insist on truth. I decided that truth was more important to me than happiness, dropped the CBT, and stuck with the meds.<p>I think you may have gotten the wrong impression of CBT. The point isn't to delude and bombard yourself with constantly positive thoughts. In fact, that rarely works for us HN-types.<p>In fact, I'd posit that it's the opposite of self-delusion: It's about viewing plain facts <i>as well as</i> your emotional bias towards them, and the (maybe false or exaggerated?) conclusions that those biases lead you to.<p>It turns out that some of us have different cognitive biases such as badly weighted risk assessment, picking the worst possible conclusion etc. It doesn't help that these form a vicious cycle. Nor that these biased thoughts sometimes seem to happen automatically (rather than you consciously coming up with them) and appear to be plain facts, already assumed and taken as granted.<p>The point is, something that looks like a crisis to me may look mildly uncomfortable to someone else. The idea is to dig down and see why.<p>edit: Another point I forgot to make is, this arms you against future encounters.

My old T9 Symbian was <i>fantastic</i> for using one-handed with my thumb. I didn't have to look at the screen to type since the keypad had tactile feedback, and navigating up and down with the direction buttons to, say, delete a row from my grocery list while walking through the store was a breeze. I can type faster on a touch screen (especially when using two thumbs), but I can't do it blind nearly as well.<p>Nowdays I hold my phone in one hand, and use the other hand's index finger to manipulate the screen. It's vastly better than a physical thumb keypad for watching media, browsing the web, or viewing any other kind of information (all of which benefits from a larger screen, which is whyepecially as a guy with large-enough hands to do one-handed operation in a pinch even on a bigger screenI prefer 4.3"" screens over the 3.5"" of the iPhone). It's also vastly better than a physical keypad for most other forms of interaction. But one-handed thumb usage has always been my mode of last resort for a touch-screen phone.

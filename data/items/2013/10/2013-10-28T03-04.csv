This is pushed by a large number of excellent departments and groups like Microsoft Research and IBM (hell, even Disney) which churn out top tier research.<p>You cannot judge people on long lists of conferences.  The people you cited have enviable CVs but only three or four peer reviwed journal papers (prior to 2010) between them.  This is comparable to anyone in the EU.  What are the impact factors of those journals?  I have no idea and am unqualified to judge.  It depends entirely on your field and what the big places to publish are.  For me, an imaging PhD student, it usually starts with ICCV and CVPR (and of course SIGGRAPH), however the actual citations come from journals, not the conference papers.<p>I have been chastised by my supervisor for citing proceedings before - a lot of people don&#x27;t consider them peer reviewed and that makes a big difference.<p>I know people who got papers in Nature or Science during their PhD posts.  In astrophysics, people regularly get four-five peer-reviwed papers over the course of a PhD because it&#x27;s a publication-heavy area.  A single Nature or Phys Rev citation is worth a lot more than five conferences you attended.  I probably won&#x27;t publish more than a couple of papers in my field, but I&#x27;m not expected to as some of it is commercially sensitive (though I may get a patent out of it instead - and more importantly, a job!).<p>At the end of the day, does it matter?  Very few PhD students are genuinely top tier.  Most of us are happy making a dent in our little niche and will probably get comfortable jobs afterwards.  Unfortunately things inevitably become a slanging match :(",1382932656

It&#x27;s people spending more because they have more money through inflation that increases profits. Not prices themselves getting higher, that&#x27;s just the affect. In any case what does it matter since you have more money, but money is worth that much less. The total wealth is the same.<p>>rising wages help borrowers repay debts.<p>Right but it&#x27;s a zero-sum game. The borrower benefits but the lender loses. Also only works once. If lenders know there is a chance of inflation they will proportionally raise their interest rate they are willing to lend at to make up for the risk.<p>Inflation is just a tax on the entire economy as everyone that owns money loses some of the value of their money. In the case of printing money, all that value goes to whatever group receives the printed money.",1382932542

6624935,comment,6624701,6624701,45,0,enoch_r,,,"Absolutely no discussion of inflation is complete without recognition of the fact that inflation and inflation expectations are at <i>historically low levels</i>[1] right now. Economists aren&#x27;t arguing that we should inflate our way out of debt--they are arguing that we should return to the historical norm. Of course, it&#x27;s possible that these economists are secretly just pushing inflation as the &quot;hidden tax&quot; we&#x27;re all up in arms about. But I find this unlikely. I find it far easier to believe that most economists actually believe that moderate inflation is <i>good for the economy</i>.<p>Why do economists believe this? Prices are sticky, and some prices are stickier than others. Prices for labor are especially sticky, which means that when growth expectations fall, it&#x27;s very difficult to decrease wages, which in turn makes it difficult for supply and demand of labor to balance. In the Cliff Note version, inflation helps because people are willing to take <i>real pay cuts</i> when they&#x27;re disguised as a <i>nominal pay increase</i>. There&#x27;s a vicious cycle during a recession, where falling output causes the price level to fall, which in turn causes more imbalance in the labor market.<p>It&#x27;s important to recognize that the standard argument for inflation has literally nothing to do with &quot;the government printing money to pay for things.&quot; Does the US government make money from seignorage? Yes, it does. Is it a significant source of income? No, not in the context of US government spending or revenue--it&#x27;s roughly $30 billion dollars a year. Are these crazy inflationary economists suggesting policies that would increase seignorage to a significant level? No, they&#x27;re not.<p>Finally, most of these arguments are disputed by the so-called &quot;Austrian school&quot; of economics. It&#x27;s important to recognize that this school is much, much, much more popular with laymen than with professional economists. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the school&#x27;s arguments are wrong, but it does raise questions about why the school&#x27;s arguments which seem so utterly convincing to so many people, don&#x27;t manage to gain many converts among people who research the subject professionally. Once again, I don&#x27;t find &quot;conspiracy&quot; a particularly good argument.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/inflation_expectations/archive.cfm?dyear=2013&dmonth=9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/inflation_expectat...</a>",1382930765

But, at a societal level, so what?  As long as the expected payoff (appropriately discounted) is large enough, that&#x27;s what matters.<p>That is my objection to FD3SA&#x27;s comment that &quot;Science has never payed off as a logical financial investment.&quot;\nand my objection to FD3SA&#x27;s comparision to art.<p>Just because science&#x27;s financial payoff is long term does not mean it isn&#x27;t a good investment.  To confuse the two issues is illogical, in an important way - which is what I&#x27;m trying to object to in FD3SA&#x27;s comment.<p>I&#x27;d accept the argument that it is difficult to <i>capture privately</i> the return from fundamental science.  That might be a reason why much science has been government funded.  But, again, that&#x27;s a different issue.<p>Governments should continue putting money into science because it is a good investment - it has a high expected return, over the long term.\nAnd, in fairness, substantial public money, globally, is still invested on this basis.<p>>In the current economy we favour short term gain hence why science is in decline.<p>How our economy is managed in the short term is a different issue from whether the long term expected return of science is positive.<p>Maybe you mean that the way our economy is currently managed, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for private actors to do science.  But that&#x27;s a totally separate issue from whether the societal return is positive.  Almost regardless of how the economy is structured in the present, if science has a high enough long term return, its still a good investment, at a societal level.<p>Someone could argue that funding art has not produced meaningful financial gain - if they were very &#x27;practically oriented&#x27; (for want of a better term) - but the same argument would not apply to science which has produced huge returns.<p>Even today, there is a massive delta between the funding science and arts gets - find me the arts&#x27; equivalent of NASA or CERN - because the long term return of science is recognised.",1382930624

Entertainment is already very expensive because people are willing to pay for it. It is made more expensive because of cable companies forcing you to bundle and pay for content you will not watch. It is not necessarily just ads that are subsidizing the content, but also other people who are paying for this content they are not viewing. I don&#x27;t think ads are going to disappear any time soon, but I think that a lot of shows in the TV industry wouldn&#x27;t make it without ads (and probably shouldn&#x27;t make it anyways with so few people watching them).",1382929289

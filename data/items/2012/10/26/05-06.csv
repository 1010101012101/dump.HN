PFUser would be a prime candidate for subclassing but that really doesn't work without a lot of shim'ing.<p>I don't like the lack of client side persistence.  There is caching with PFQuery but it's caching the json response from the server.  For example, let's say I have a message board with 1000 messages.  If the user posts a message, I can't simply add the new post and have it cached, I would have to query and pull down all 1001 messages.<p>Now, I've written all the boilerplate around the parse SDK to do all of this, but it was kind of hacky.  So now I'm ripping it all out and just using the REST API with my own custom digs.  Much smoother.  I'm slowly moving it over to it's own static lib at:  <a href=""https://github.com/jawngee/CloudObject"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jawngee/CloudObject</a><p>Don't get me wrong though, their SDK is definitely usable, but after a certain point it becomes a little cumbersome.",1351231147

4701005,comment,4699971,4700873,1,0,krapp,,,"I suppose you're right to a degree when it comes to supermarket doors and some car locks, the idea that things should be so connected is certainly already present, and there's no reason to expect it not to saturate wherever it can. But there would remain real value to the low tech approach for a number of reasons. Physical locks are less expensive than networked locks would be. Networked locks would be subject to the vulnerabilities that come with being connected to the internet and being run by software, whereas physical locks wouldn't. I think Bruce Schneier said 'complexity is the enemy of security' (if not I'm sure I'll be corrected) and the analog stupidity of physical locks is what makes them useful. Although granted, physical locks can be hacked too, and are, I'd submit that the networked variety would likely be no less vulnerable to physical attack, and still more vulnerable to attacks over the network (so, implicitly, less secure.)<p>A ubiquitous system for locks that somehow can identify you by proximity, can also be used to track your movements and whereabouts. Networked locks could be theoretically controlled from a remote location, leaving someone else to act as, essentially, the systems administrator for your physical access privileges. This is what they do in prisons. Applying the concept of separating someone from direct control over their physical access-space to a large scale, and it looks a bit ominous - at least if this assumes these network locks are also commonplace on cars, houses, hotel rooms, hospital rooms, etc. This is not even considering what happens when power goes out, or the network goes down. Physical locks still work without electrical power, and the tumblers only care about the piece of metal that's currently jammed into the slot and whether it moves the pins properly... principle of least privilege.<p>I can see this sort of thing becoming somewhat more commonplace but I also see its spread as self-limiting. E-books aren't going to replace physical books, the internet isn't going to replace television, which hasn't replaced radio, which hasn't replaced theatre. In each case, the newer version of the technology does provide their own advantages and enhancements of the medium but not to the degree that the older, less complex version no longer has relevance. The future is never going to be that evenly distributed, this I believe. In a hundred years, some people might be genetically engineered posthuman cyborgs linked to a quantum hivemind, but someone, somewhere, will be living in village of mud and stone. People will still use physical locks because there's no real reason for most people not to. They could theoretically still work in a hundred years.

DRM and DMCA are more likely to be mistaken for sporting goods manufacturers, record labels, or any number of things other than being known for what they are. The community that this is relevant to is still a minority - a shrinking one - but a minority nonetheless. And while it is a reason and logically minded community by nature, legal protection acts typically have an emotional component from those lobbying for their creation, because it has to do with their security. And income security lobbyists in particular tend to disregard anything but black numbers or red numbers until forced to do otherwise. Right or wrong, it seems the higher the income, the squeakier the wheel. I think it's a Ben Franklin quote: ""If you forego freedom in favor of security, you will eventually lose both."" If there's a solution down the road, I hope someone finds it before someone else takes it to heart that irrationality doesn't respond to rationality - but fear - and does something to hurt what chance there is at more digital freedom for the rest of us.

(I thought <i>I</i> was the last one.)<p>First is the lack of standardization.  Asterisks traditionally meant boldface, I thought, but in some of these systems they mean italics.  Some use underscores for italics, while others use slashes.  And those are just the common conventions; the less frequently used ones tend to be even less standardized.<p>Second is the fact that the more conventions these languages implement, the more likely I am to emit one unintentionally, and then have to figure out how to escape the input so it's treated literally, if the language even supports that. (Note for instance the long-standing Lisp convention of putting asterisks around special variable names.)<p>Thirdly, the syntax rules of these languages are often ill-specified and incorrectly implemented, making it difficult to tell at times how to get the effect I want.<p>EDITED to add: if you're wondering what I would suggest as an alternative to Markdown-style markup, this is an example of the kind of thing I prefer: <a href=""http://nbsp.io/development/doccy-a-mid-weight-markup-language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nbsp.io/development/doccy-a-mid-weight-markup-languag...</a><p>The syntax is uniform, but much easier to type than bare HTML.",1351228555

7722674,comment,7721601,7721601,67,0,grellas,,,"Disappointing as this result is for those who want IP law to adapt more cleanly to developer realities, and much as I loved Judge Alsup&#x27;s decision in the lower court (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4051761"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4051761</a>), this is certainly not some badly reasoned decision by this particular 3-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit.<p>What the panel essentially did was continue to apply Ninth Circuit law as it has existed since the 1989 <i>Johnson Controls</i> case holding that the sequence, structure, and organization (so-called &quot;SSO&quot;) of a computer program may be entitled to copyright protection depending on the facts of a case. Judge Alsup had not disregarded this precedent but had found what in my view were superb ways of treating APIs in particular in a special way that rendered the copying of their SSO non-infringing - to wit, acknowledging that developing an API was even highly creative, a structure of this type, functioning as a method for compatibility only, should not in itself be protected by copyright but should be protected, if at all, only if it rose to the level of warranting patent protection. How he got there was somewhat complex given that this is a complex area of law. But that is where he had landed. The result, as a matter of policy, was very clean for developers: it gave the courts a workable roadmap for moving the copyright analysis into conformity with the modern digital age on the critical area of APIs and inter-operability without the need of having Congress address the issues.<p>This panel did the exact opposite. It held that, when it comes to the subject matter of copyright, if a form of expression meets the threshold of being &quot;original,&quot; that is enough to make it copyrightable no matter what its function. If the developer of an API had to make creative choices in deciding how to set up the SSO of the API (and almost certainly he will), then the API is protectible and any attempt to copy the same SSO is infringing on its face, subject only to fair use and similar defenses. In so holding, this panel vigorously reasserted the <i>Johnson Controls</i> precedent that has hung over SSO analysis in the Ninth Circuit for many years - meaning, in the case of APIs, it is for a jury to determine case-by-case whether any particular SSO is protectible by copyright. The panel here by no means disregarded the concerns and issues raised by Google (and highlighted in Judge Alsup&#x27;s decision) but it relegated them to being a potential defense under fair use analysis for acts that are otherwise presumptively infringing. The result: stronger IP protection for APIs and a wealth of uncertainty created for developers in trying to work with inter-operability issues in our modern age.<p>This case sparked intense interest and drew upon many top lawyers on both sides to argue the issues. It is by no means some hack result. Indeed, it could be argued to be far more in line with Ninth Circuit precedents than Judge Alsup&#x27;s decision. It can be appealed further, possibly to the full Ninth Circuit complement of judges and possibly to the Supreme Court, and who knows whether it will be upheld or not.<p>But the really sad thing is the missed opportunity. This was a chance to bring clarity and order to an otherwise muddled area of law and this panel, rightly or not, chose to go back to the muddle. Should it ultimately be upheld, the only real solution in light of this is for Congress to amend the Copyright Act to do a carve-out for APIs to enable them to get special handling under the law to facilitate inter-operability.",1399661860

The merger doctrine basically says that an expression is not copyrightable if the expression is inextricably merged with the idea.<p>So I&#x27;m imagining a bunch of Java classes loaded into memory. They&#x27;re objects, and they have methods, and those methods refer to methods in other objects. Creating this state of memory is functional, and definitely not protect-able. Now, the interface declarations, then, are just a description of this state of memory. A method has a particular name or a particular set of parameters but those are just a description of the functionality, and there is no other way to precisely describe that state of affairs. The closest analogue I can think of to an API is a phone book, and the names and addresses in a phone book are not copyrightable, although higher-level structure might be.<p>I think the court got stuck on the verbatim copying and that prevented them from seeing things this way.",1399659136
7722410,comment,7721096,7722277,2,0,tetha,,,"We are currently refactoring a bunch of stuff at work, and by now we can largely manage dependencies between various subsystems with the type system - without the type checking being too intrusive. Basically this means: If I have the current application and I add a new subsystem because I need it, and I don&#x27;t have all the requirements of this system in place already, I get an error at compile time telling me to fix this. This makes it very hard to do certain classes of mistakes.<p>The interesting thing is that a sufficiently powerful type system with strong type inference eventually converges with dynamic typing in ease of use, but it offers the option to do rather complex reasoning about the code at compile time, again, preventing certain classes of errors.<p>Beyond the classes of errors being prevented, I feel like a mature, strongly typed architecture offers a certain amount of guidance in implementing new solutions. If you start implementing certain interfaces in our more mature codebases, you get a number of situations you need to handle - since the interface forces you to implement certain methods. You can&#x27;t forget these situations, again, preventing mistakes or recreating the same bugs.<p>Note that both situations assume a certain level of maturity in a solution. Initially, a type system can be somewhat annoying while you work out the kinks, I&#x27;m perfectly fine to admit this. This requirement also implies what I feel - in small, hacky scripts, static type systems tend to be annoying to some degree. But in large, complex systems, I don&#x27;t want to miss them.",1399659136

But many times, bookmarks have a life, some could be temporary (e.g. craigslist apartment search link) which don&#x27;t mean much after a certain time period etc. So my idea is that we should have a bookmark service that is fluid and dynamic.<p>1) EXPIRATION DATE: A bookmark will have a expiration date/timestamp which is user configurable. Say be default 180 days. A week before this expiration, users gets a notification that unless they want to keep this bookmark, it will be deleted/archived. This way, your clutter of bookmarks that are no longer needed is auto managed.<p>2) CONTEXT: When I bookmark something and come back to it few weeks/month later, I forget the context of why I bookmarked it. Sure, many times you know why because you did it of course. But tell me how many times you have looked at a Bookmark and went &quot;Why did I bookmark this again&quot;. Context is important because lets say I came across a nice blog on &quot;How to Add Google Analytics on your website&quot;, I might want to bookmark because I am thinking about using it for a specific webpage for my startup. Alternatively, I could bookmark the same page to share with someone who is looking to learn google analytics. Stuff like that. Again, context also helps with #1 because if I am just apartment hunting, i won&#x27;t need those bookmarks after I find a place.<p>3) SYNCING: A bookmark should just not be locally available on my computer but synced with whichever device/system I am  using.<p>4) TAGGING: Tag and categorize bookmarks using an easy interface. I hate the folder structure offered by browsers today.<p>4) SIMILAR BOOKMARKS: A potential social feature where once I bookmark a page, based on the tag/category, it shows me other similar pages/bookmarks done by users. Don&#x27;t reveal any personal user info of course but it might be nice to see what others are bookmarking in similar categories.<p>May be some of this is overkill but these are my desired features for bookmarks.",1399659131

The main difference is not audio quality (the M50 probably has an edge here) but rather comfort and ear fatigue, with the Beats just being more comfortable.<p>I love my M50s but admit they do lead to sweaty-ear.<p>Examples:<p><a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/t/683959/new-beats-studios-2013-vs-audio-technica-ath-m50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.head-fi.org/t/683959/new-beats-studios-2013-vs-au...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/products/beats-studio-over-ear-headphone-black-new"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.head-fi.org/products/beats-studio-over-ear-headph...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/t/673273/new-2013-beats-studios"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.head-fi.org/t/673273/new-2013-beats-studios</a>\n<a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/t/675031/new-redesigned-2013-beats-by-dre-studio-v2-in-red-white-unboxing-newbeatsstudio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.head-fi.org/t/675031/new-redesigned-2013-beats-by...</a><p>The main legitimate complaint about Beats is not that they&#x27;re one of the two best sounding headphones under $300.  It&#x27;s that the market will bear that much of a price difference when the ATH M50 is $150.   But, people will pay a lot for a wide selection of colours and a bit more comfort.  And price can be seen as a feature.<p>In short - Beats sells decent quality for its class,  overpriced for what you get, but between comfort and colour selection, customers don&#x27;t seem to mind.  These guys will fit with Apple&#x27;s philosophy well.",1399659053

If you&#x27;re talking about planned obsolescence then Apple could be excused for being in the technology market; which changes rapidly.<p>I use Apple products (except for a phone, which is a Nexus 4) and I nearly always feel that their products are of a higher quality, this might be because of materials (rarely plastic) or it might be because their UI seems much more refined than other offerings, I always feel with Apple that they have obsessed over the details. If quality is perceived (perception, past-tense) – is it not quality? Or am I missing something? Quality can come from an assembly line too.",1399659053

7722336,comment,7720931,7722092,2,0,epaladin,,,"Agreed.\nThe MDR-7506 is a &quot;studio standard&quot; for reference/monitor headphones in pro audio and video. The frequency response is not &quot;enhanced&quot; at the low end like the Beats and many other modern headphones. I don&#x27;t think the curve is really flat- they always sound a little bright to me (thought in that hear-more-detail sort of naturally pleasant way), but they&#x27;re definitely more flat than the Beats. The 7506 is like $90. The V6 has the same drivers, but doesn&#x27;t have a gold plated plug (seriously). I got my V6s refurbed for $50. The closed earpads passively block external sound pretty well, and they&#x27;re relatively comfortable. They don&#x27;t come in green or pink, but they sound good, are still made with some metal parts for durability, and they&#x27;re way cheaper than Beats.\nSource: work in a couple different TV production studios, a friend that&#x27;s in the audio/acoustics industry, and a lot of reviews at B & H.",1399658525

7722334,comment,7721356,7721356,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"Doesn&#x27;t this come off a bit as overkill? Especially adding the comparison interfaces. In F# you&#x27;d do something like:<p><pre><code>  type TypeId = TypeId of int\n    with \n      static member Gold = TypeId 1 \n</code></pre>\nCustom is now just &quot;TypeId 123&quot;. Otherwise, TypeId.Gold. (This is assuming you don&#x27;t want to specify the cases directly as union cases).<p>You can also abstract this to a general phantom type like &quot;type Id<&#x27;a> = Id of int&quot;. Now functions can ask for an Id<&#x27;a> for arbitrary types. Sort of like a poor version of the units-of-measurement.<p>This article&#x27;s kind of boilerplate OO stuff seems like it&#x27;s out of control. Over the past week, I&#x27;ve been using open source clients in .NET to connect to social media services. And a common thread is to write oh-so-much code and provide tons of types just to get a simple job done.<p>One Twitter client lib requires <i>7</i> binaries.

But why is it obvious that this acquisition makes sense at that particular price? I&#x27;m not saying that it doesn&#x27;t make sense, only that you have to at the very least consider how much the company is worth to Apple, before you declare it a no-brainer acquisition. Would it still make sense at $4B? $6B? How much would be too much before this is “obviously” a bad deal?",1399658484

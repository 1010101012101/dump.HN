6808030,comment,6807524,6807819,2,0,lmm,,,"Most collection libraries (e.g. the Java one) work like this - you have List as an interface and can use LinkedList or ArrayList or so on. I particularly like scala&#x27;s approach to factory-like methods combined with this; Seq is an interface, as is List, with implementations like LinkedList. But you can do any of LinkedList(1, 2, 3), List(1, 2, 3), or Seq(1, 2, 3) - and get back a LinkedList, a List (which will be an implementation-selected implementation, possibly LinkedList), or a Seq (which again will be an implementation-selected implementation, possibly LinkedList).",1385560769

Right now the protocol seems to preclude group messaging.<p>Also, until TextSecure becomes very popular, it seems possible for an adversary to gather metadata of all TextSecure conversations via traffic analysis.  As a simple example, imagine there are only four people using TextSecure:  A, B, C, and D.  Let&#x27;s say A and B exchange several text messages within a few minutes.  Then C and D exchange messages a few minutes later.  Since A and B are talking to TextSecure&#x27;s servers at about the same time, it can be inferred that they&#x27;re texting eachother.  C and D can be similarly pegged.<p>Until TextSecure becomes so popular that many messages per second are being sent, it seems possible to collect metadata on all users who exchange text messages in realtime.  If both the sender and receiver have the TextSecure app open and are actively exchanging text messages, then they&#x27;ll probably be the only mobile users communicating with TextSecure&#x27;s servers within the same ~200ms interval.<p>This could be mitigated by generating cover traffic.  Each user could download some fake data from the servers every few seconds.  But this would drain battery life very quickly.<p>Are there any plans to defend against traffic analysis?<p>(I only bring this up because one of the goals of TextSecure is to obscure metadata from telcos, as stated in <a href=\"https://whispersystems.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://whispersystems.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/</a>)",1385560672

With parallelism slow single-threaded performance can still yield reasonable response-times if you can throw multiple cores at the problem.<p>But even if you have parallelism, a slow single-threaded GC would halt all of those threads, again affecting your response times.<p>I don&#x27;t know about V8, but mozilla&#x27;s JS is suffering from similar issues.

If I see a ccTLD, I <i>know</i> that it&#x27;s delegated to a country, and isn&#x27;t some phishing attempt at gTLD level. Since I&#x27;m familiar with the .uk space, if I see a .gov.uk, I <i>know</i> that it&#x27;s delegated to the UK Government, and that it isn&#x27;t some phishing attempt at .uk level.

People say that it&#x27;s full, so we need more space. But instead of growing down the hierarchy, where there&#x27;s unlimited space, they want to grow up, where there is just one namespace left.<p>But you can only grow up once.<p>If we didn&#x27;t have a .com, and we just let people register in the gTLD space directly, then where would we be now?<p>If we want to think commercially, &quot;like a startup&quot;, then companies should be able to register a .com and sell subdomains to third parties. They&#x27;ve certainly tried. Why can&#x27;t they achieve notable success? Because the .com space is diluted free-for-all space where a .com name cannot achieve the level of notability needed, just as what will happen to the gTLD space if ICANN continue on this path.<p>The rationale for adding arbitrary gTLDs is self-deprecating.

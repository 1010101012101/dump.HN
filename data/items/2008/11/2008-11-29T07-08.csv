379981,comment,379942,379942,0,0,apu,,,"If possible, I'd advise you to take more challenging and/or more interesting courses. I know there are probably several required courses that you cannot avoid (of which many are probably going to be worthless/boring), but for the ones where you can choose, pick ones that interest you. Often, more off-beat courses can be very rewarding -- for example courses in foreign cultures, various arts-related courses, etc.<p>Also, I'd use college as a means of finding talented people you might want to work with in the future. It's an ideal place to meet such people, and perhaps even start cooking something up together.<p>Finally, college is perhaps one of the last times when you'll have large chunks of time to do whatever you want (especially if you feel your classes are easy). Take advantage of this to explore your interests.",1227945225

379979,comment,379942,379942,0,0,vlad,,,"1) College students don't ask how old you are, but what year.  Take classes in the summer and winter to change that faster.<p>2) Since you do care about learning, but want to pick your own classes and also learn more efficiently, talk to your advisors.  They will let you take more fun, advanced classes in place of ones you are taking right now.<p>3) Realize that in the US, the same freedom students have to do virtually nothing and still stay in the program until graduation is the same freedom that allows a student to concentrate and complete their studies much sooner.  Rigorous schools around the world make sure students do the same amount of work, but such programs can sometimes limit students who want to go even faster or pick their own loads each semester depending on what they want to do outside of school.  Here, schools give you a wide variety of ways to take classes (on campus, online, winter, summer, transfer credit from other schools), majors, credit loads, class offerings, and just enough structure to keep students on a path.  However, the freedom to chart one's own path and speed is given to the student--so take advantage of it.<p>My other post for you:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=379988"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=379988</a>",1227944836

379973,comment,379936,379959,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Couldn't disagree more.  Here's my .02:<p>1. I don't think the existence of reputation causes a great deal of anxiety in our society.  In fact, until the advent of the Internet, this was largely how society functioned: you were known for what you had accomplished or failed to accomplish, for your associations, for your character or lack thereof.  This is still largely the way things are, and I don't think most people think about it very much at all.<p>2. Drawing a corollary between anxiety over damage to your reputation due to poor performance at a previous job and anxiety because too many people down-voted you on Hacker News and now your karma score is distributed is...well...ridiculous.  Hacker News isn't real life, and that little number by your username means pretty much nothing.<p>3. The proposed idea would not stop people from creating new accounts, fake accounts, etc.  In no way would this inhibit anonymity, which seems to be what you're suggesting.<p>4. I doubt if most people would resist the idea that if they build a reputation in one community, it would be transferable to another community.  People are lazy, and generally do not resist anything that makes life easier or more convenient for them.<p>Incidentally, I strongly doubt that any of the top 10 reasons why OpenID hasn't taken off are what you stated; people will give up just about anything for convenience sake.  OpenID hasn't taken off because most people just don't care enough to try and understand it.<p>Again, just my .02 :-)",1227944403

This seems odd since most of the videos are marketing related, and they are making it _harder_, not easier, to be marketed to.  It doesn't matter how good the quality of quicktime is (if it is better), it's not a video if I can't watch it.",1227944335

Mailing lists are just that -- mailing lists.  It's not a simple one-to-many delivery service like, say, sending a confirmation e-mail for account creation or sending out alerts to people who subscribe to some kind specific alert.<p>When companies say ""sign up for our mailing list"" it just means ""add your e-mail to a list so we can contact you,"" it's not an invitation to a discussion group.",1227943963

379965,comment,379232,379798,0,0,iigs,,,"Land isn't perfectly fungible -- in fact, one of the cornerstones of the tech startup world is that land near SF, CA or Boston, MA is worth many orders of magnitude more than land in eastern Iowa or western Texas for certain people.<p>There's very little value in preserving any particular acre of land in Iowa (0.8%) -- they're all essentially the same, and the one thing that land is good for is growing corn/soybeans. Likewise with TX, as far as I know it's roughly a gradient of drilling for oil in the west to ranch land in the east.<p>Unlike ranch land (generally uninteresting as park land) and farm land (crops would be destroyed by tourism), forest land (Washington state, and I assume a fair amount the mountainous portions of the other western states, as well) is a bit different in that the land can be used simultaneously as wood crop land and park space. On the east side of Seattle there are some large commercially owned forests that are legally obligated to provide public access for fishing, hunting, and mountain biking. You can achieve similar results with state ownership of the forest land and logging grants -- making the land valuable to hold as state (national) property.<p>I think the TX poverty issue could be attributed to the low-profit land not supporting much more than the people it takes to operate it. The overwhelming amount of said space probably overshadows the (moderately-)positive effects of the big cities.",1227943506
379964,comment,379942,379942,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Two things:<p>1. As someone else already stated, it doesn't sound like you have any concrete plans or alternatives, so dropping out might not be the best option.  When I was an undergrad, I was fascinated by the tales of so many extremely wealthy people who had dropped out of college and gotten rich through tech startups (Gates, Dell, Zuckerberg, etc, etc).  I wondered if there was some link between dropping out of school and success in technology. However, I was confusing correlation with causation, as these people weren't rich because they dropped out...they dropped out because they had started something that was growing so fiercely that it took up all their time.  If you don't have that something that pretty much forces you to drop out, don't do it.  If you feel like you're torn and you're not sure what to do, don't quit school.<p>2. I mean no offense at all here, but it sounds like your communication skills in English could be improved.  This may not seem like a huge deal, but learning to express yourself well through the written and spoken word will serve you well the rest of your life.  Others might disagree with me on this, and perhaps there are better ways to improve that area, but college <i>seems</i> like it would be a good environment to do so, though I have no firsthand experience in the matter.<p>Good luck no matter what you decide.",1227943501

379959,comment,379936,379936,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'm going to have to say no.  One of the largest sources of anxiety in our society is this belief that we have a dossier following us around.  And we do.  New jobs won't hire us without references from our old jobs.  We have to fill in empty spaces in some way.  Schools won't let us in unless we have a good record.<p>The internet allows some respite from that.  We can simply create an account and go on our merry way.  Screw up?  Start over!<p>Yes, it allows trolls to troll, but it also removes the anxiety of failure and dossiers.  It's (one reason) why OpenID hasn't caught on - most people would rather NOT authenticate beyond reasonable doubt that they are who they say they are on the internet across sites.  They don't want everything they've said to be traceable to them.<p>If this is an opt-in system built around a number of sites where you can share karma OpenID-style, you'll find people creating their own shell sites to boost their karma.  Good for nothing.  If it's a mandatory system in a few sites, you'll find users rebel.  We choose our communities because we want to be there and we recognize that when we go to another community, we need to work to gain a reputation there.",1227943206
379958,comment,379942,379942,0,0,charlesju,,,"I'm 1.5 weeks away from graduation and I know exactly how you are feeling. So perhaps I can provide some insight.<p>School has crammed a bunch of useless information down my throat that I will never use again in my life. It has tested me in a format that in no way shape or form reflects how well I can contribute to society (in that, if I had Google, which I do in real life, I can ace every test that I have ever taken). I've essentially picked up everything in school by reading a book since, like you, I go to a top 25 public University where the professors are all on tenure and don't give a rats ass about the students.<p>But in light of all that, I am still damn proud of my soon to be college degree. At the end of the day you have the rest of your life to be a slave to the ""man"", but you only really have these couple of years to live up your youth and enjoy the finer stages in life (ie. college frat parties).<p>So my suggestion is to look outside just college as a means to an end, but rather an end in and of itself.",1227943193

It's great that you're already well ahead academically, but try and enjoy college in other ways, be it through challenging yourself with non-hacker-related courses or meeting interesting non-hackers.

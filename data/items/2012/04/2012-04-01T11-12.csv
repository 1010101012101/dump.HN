It tells me whether they care about themselves, whether they have a good taste. Ultimately yes, in my experience, there's a correlation between ""spiffy clothing"" and ""trustworthiness"".<p>And I'm convinced that most people do the same, whether they admit it or not.",1333281440

I'd like that accepting a job as a politician involved full transparency.

3783438,comment,3783022,3783382,2,0,napoleoncomplex,,,"I agree in regards to a better software update process. I don't know how much the abstraction could be improved, since the diversity makes some things impossible to abstract. I should clarify I'm talking from a perspective of developing apps, not games (simple apps at that, as I started learning Android slightly more than half a year ago), so I haven't encountered the really difficult development issues that games developers stumble upon so often. What I have learned so far, however, has helped me plan out each project better. What in the beginning seemed an issue that will double the amount of work (and maybe even was so on the first project), ended up being solved with maybe 5 to 10% more effort and thought on the second project.<p>Yes, either way you look at it, it is more work, but with experience it has become more or less marginal for me. Although it could also be that once you accept something as unchangeable fact, you adapt expectations and it no longer represents a source of frustration :). Who knows!<p>Edit: Reading my post, I realised how ridiculous my claim of experience is based on working on Android for less than a year, especially without any other previous programming experience, but I hope it's still clear what I mean.",1333281347

3783436,comment,3783022,3783022,25,0,clumsysmurf,,,"Like the author, I have been writing Android software for a while (nov 2009). However, I completely disagree with his conclusion.<p>When I think ""fragmentation"", device sizes and configurations are the least of my worries, although the tooling around this area is very poor and needs improvement. The real fragmentation issues are things involving bugs which are hard to work around, like<p>* Froyo having a number of NIO bugs (ByteBuffer.AllocateDirect & selectors) (which were fixed later on)\n* Samsung GPS driver not filling in Location.getTime()\n* HTC Desire and others having broken Bluetooth stacks<p>Or advice from Google like:<p>""Apache HTTP client has fewer bugs on Eclair and Froyo. It is the best choice for these releases. For Gingerbread and better, HttpURLConnection is the best choice.""<p>I have always found Android and its tools to be extremely buggy. Then take into account you are going to have to maneuver around all of these bugs not for one version of the OS, but essentially every version put out for the past 2 years. Many bugs are from Apache Harmony, a huge pile of turd, which is defunct.<p>Also, fragmentation comes in other forms entirely, like the Kindle Fire, which does not pass CTS and does not have all of the android APIs (I see the possibility of Google subsidizing a low cost ASUS tablet as a move against this existential threat).<p>Additionally, the newly published design guidelines are for ICS and above, but most developers will target Froyo-ICS. Its quite a challenge making an app which follows these guidelines if you are also targeting pre-ICS devices. So even the guidelines are ""fragmented"".<p>I'm really looking closely at how Windows Phone does. Its becoming more difficult to write non-trivial apps for Android unless you can afford a bunch of phones to test on, or use one of the testing services like Perfecto.<p>But there is potentially a startup opportunity here. Perhaps someone could create a database that lets you drill down, by API, to see which phones have issues. It would be great if lint hooked into this database and gave me a list of phones to exclude in the market, if I didn't feel like working around them.",1333281302

It would require some harm to come to them and in that case it didn't matter is some app was involved or not.<p>The harm would matter and guess what, we already have laws for that. It doesn't matter whether you killed a guy with your car, a gun, a bow, an axe, a piece of wood or you computer. What you will be punished for is killing him.<p>And there is no blame here. Only consequences. If you share your information it may be used by third-parties for purposes that you don't much like. If you jump out of a 3th floor window, you may die. We don't have a problem with telling people that they shouldn't jump out of buildings.<p>Stating that there is likely to be some consequence for a particular action -- whether it is going down to the shady side of town, running in an old abandoned building or eating twenty pizzas a week -- doesn't mean blaming the people involved.

3783361,comment,3783204,3783298,1,0,tjoff,,,"Yes, I'm in Sweden and yes we have the FRA law. But there are huge differences between this and the FRA law. The FRA explicitly forbids FRA to intercept/process traffic that is meant to stay within the borders. Both laws are an insult to democracy but my take from this is that this is much worse and they have different intents.<p>Why is it better to have this thing legislated? The argument that it is better to have laws like this because otherwise they will just do it anyway (illegally) just blows my mind. There are many advantages to having stuff like this unlegislated, without support from the law they can't actively act on the data, something that is far better than having the FRA-law. Especially when the intent of the law isn't to act on it but rather to observe.<p>In other words that argument is of the lines that ""since they already have the information (which they illegally intercepted), why wouldn't we want to give them the legal right to intercept that information so that they act on it as well?"". How does that make any sense?<p>Even with a warrant the data collected by FRA wouldn't be legal to use in a court if both parties (sender and receiver of a message/whatever) was in Sweden (regardless of whether the traffic took a detour across the border or not (too/from gmails servers for instance)).",1333278634

3783354,comment,3783022,3783022,8,0,beggi,,,"> As of march 2012, 92% of devices are running Android 2.2 (Froyo) and higher. The<p>> Froyo feature set is a really good base line for most of the applications. I challenge<p>> you to find a new feature in higher versions that you really need to have in a general purpose app.<p>So, for ""general purpose apps"", whatever that is, Android 2.2 (which was launched 2 years ago) is\ngreat. 2 years is <i>ages</i> in computer land and this is a huge issue, even though the author likes to downplay\nthis because the 2 year old software works ""just fine"". Android is very fragmented and if you\nhave to develop for 2 year old software still today, that's a big proof.<p>> Developer tools<p>This whole section can be skipped when developing for iOS. Big deal, there are tools to\nhelp you develop for the chaos that is the Android flora. Just because the tools exist doesn't mean\nit's easy to support all these different devices.<p>> Developers can provide different graphics for different screen sizes<p>I don't have the exact number on the range of Android screen sizes, but there's much more\nwork to this than the author implies. Just because you can doesn't mean it's easy.<p>> There is an emulator and UI builder that can emulate any Android version, screen resolution<p>> and pixel density combo<p>The ARM emulator is really <i>really</i> slow. Maybe it's picked up speed with Android x86 but\nwhen I was developing for Android the emulator was almost unusable and basically everybody's\nadvice was to go out and buy an Android device. This will get pretty expensive pretty fast if\nyou need to emulate the range of Android devices.<p>> It doesn’t matter if you prefer a large vs a small screen, a hardware keyboard vs software<p>> input, a 1Ghz+ quadcore vs a 600Mhz single core, a device from an A brand vs a Chinese<p>> copy or maybe you just want the best available phone for you specific budget.<p>> There will be a device available for your needs. This is only possible due to the so called<p>> “fragmentation”.<p>IMHO, sure, some people prefer larger screen or a hardware keyboard. But the rest of this\nparagraph doesn't make sense. Who'd want a single core rather than quadcore? Who'd want a\nchinese knock off instead of a brand? This is both just a question of budget. So in reality,\nagain IMHO, I think the ""featureful"" difference between Android devices is much less then is purported\nin this post.<p>Just one more thing, I'm not knocking on Android as such - variety is good and Android has some\nfeatures over iOS and iOS has features over Android. But having developed a little bit\nfor both platforms, Android is definitely very fragmented and harder to develop for.",1333278404

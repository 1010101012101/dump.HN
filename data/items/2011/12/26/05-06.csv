3392310,comment,3392141,3392207,8,0,stephth,,,"My work involves designing interfaces and this discussion could help me understand this topic better; but like the author of the article, your post shows some intense frustration towards rollover-only elements, but none made it very evident to me as to why it's so frustrating and why it's so ""stupid"". We all experience things differently, and I'd love to picture a perspective where it's so frustrating.<p>Here's how I see it (and as you'll see, I'll be taking various assumptions. Please feel free to tell me I'm wrong (but make a case)):<p>We like to have everything at hand, but we also like (it's more like a need actually) to <i>focus</i>. Too many elements are a distraction. That's basically why we put things in boxes even if we don't intend to transport them anywhere: out of our sight. Our brains want/need to focus. That would be my answer to your question ""What is the affordance of invisibility?"".<p>The example of Google - if that really is a delete contact button, I don't use that app - I would agree is bad design, because its effort to find it outweights the benefits of having it hidden (partly because its placement is not apparently logical and that makes it extra hard to find).<p>In the first example in the article (github) however, I would tend to think that that specific solution is OK. The author of the article forgot to explain what that button does. A quick look at github, a rollover and a click (three actions) shows me that its function is it edits <i>the description of the repository</i>. How often do you edit the description of a repository? Not that often. Probably very rarely. And the more you use github, the smaller its usage gets proportionally to the rest of the app. The day you need it, you'll find it relatively quickly. Because you've experienced this practice for a while in other sites, and even more so because you've seen github act like that every now and then. Your brain is able to predict that if you don't see it, it might very well be rollover-only. The first logical place you try is the <i>within the repository dashboard, over the description of the repository</i>. Not too hard. I think in this case the benefits of <i>every time I read that page not having that element there and not having to neutralize it myself with my brain by ignoring it</i> vastly outshine the effort of <i>looking for it when I rarely need it</i>. It's a good deal. [1]<p>I would love to understand a little more about why this concept didn't work out for you.<p><i>edit: typos, formatting and deleted some unneeded parts</i><p>--<p>[1] The github element in the case of a touch interface is not great, I would agree, because it's harder to <i>predict</i> that by <i>touching</i> the white area of the description the button will show up. But it works (as in: you can still access it). And you have to cut interface designers some slack (or instead give us the strength we need): we're still trying to figure out what to do exactly with the current mess of having two very different types of clients (mouse and touch) accessing our web interfaces. After we figure out <i>if</i> we should unify, we need to figure out <i>how</i>. Killing rollover interactions might be a necessary casualty in that road (but that would make part of me sad, there are wonderful usages of rollover, see for example the custom sliders in here: <a href=""http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/</a>), either way I'd love to understand a little more, and I assumed that in this discussion we're focusing on rollover, not touch.",1324877993

If you expect managers to be ruthless about  shareholder value you'll wind up with managers who are ruthless about benefitting themselves.<p><i>The Enron problem is ... the predictable result of too strong of a share-centered view of the public corporation... Corporate law demands that managers simultaneously be selfless servants and selfish masters. On the one hand, it directs managers to be faithful agents, setting aside their own interests entirely in order to act only on behalf of their principals, the shares. On the other hand, in the service of this extreme altruism, they must ruthlessly exploit everyone around them, projecting on to the shares an extreme selfishness that takes no account of any interests but the shares themselves. Having maximally exploited their fellow human corporate participants, managers are then expected to selflessly hand over their gains...</i><p><i>Altruism and rationally self-interested exploitation are extreme and radically opposed positions, psychologically and politically. ... For managers, one easy resolution of these tensions is a simple, cynical selfishness in which managers see themselves as entitled, and perhaps even required, to exploit shareholders as ruthlessly as they understand the law to require them to exploit everyone else. ...</i><p><i>Internally, the share-centered paradigm is just as self-destructive. Corporations succeed because they are not markets and do not follow market norms of behavior. Rather, they operate under fiduciary norms as a matter of law and team norms as a matter of sociology. However, the share-centered paradigm of corporate law teaches managers to treat employees as outsiders and tools to corporate ends with no intrinsic value. Just as managers are unlikely to learn simultaneously to be selfish maximizers and selfless altruists, they are unlikely to be simultaneously cooperative team players and self-interested defectors. Thus, the share-centered view undermines the prerequisite to operating the firm in the interests of shareholders. ...</i><p><i>Managers constructing the firm as a tool to the end of share value maximization treat the people with whom they work as means, not ends. ...they learn as part of their ordinary life to break ordinary social solidarity. Learning to exploit ruthlessly is surprisingly difficult. ... But cynicism can be learned, and managers subjected to the powerful incentives of the share value maximization principle do eventually learn it. ... This training, however, surely creates cynics, not faithful agents. ... A manager whose lived experience is a pretense of selflessness (with respect to employees, customers and business partners) covering real disinterested exploitation (on behalf of shares) is unlikely to suddenly see himself as “in a position in which thought of self was to be renounced, however hard the abnegation” and voluntarily hand over these hard-won gains of competitive practice to his principal. If you can properly lie to your subordinates, why not lie to your superior as well? ... In the end, the cynicism of the share value maximization view must eat itself alive.</i><p>-- <a href=""http://slackwire.blogspot.com/2011/04/selfish-masters-selfless-servants.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slackwire.blogspot.com/2011/04/selfish-masters-selfle...</a>",1324876994

Ramanujan used the book to master all of 18th and 19th century mathematics. He set about to demonstrate each of the assertions of the book, using only his slate to do the calculations. He would jot down the formula to be proved, and then erase it with his elbow, and then continue to jot down some more formulas. In this way, he worked through the entire book.

It had some interesting anecdotes about betting on professional football in the early 1960s in the United States, which the author takes as an analogy to the current stock market. I searched back through the list of earlier Steve Denning articles on Forbes to try to find one previously posted to HN that I remember for its silliness and lack of connection with reality. On my part, I can't see I disagree a lot with the idea that publicly traded joint-stock companies do well to attend to the needs of customers, to build long-term value, but the author seems to embroider that claim with a lot of hysteria about the future of capitalism. Precisely because he can point to successful examples (Johnson and Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Apple), it seems to me that what he identifies as an idea that leads companies astray can be responded to as a market opportunity for other companies to achieve the goal of maximizing shareholder value (over the long term) by the instrumental means of attending to customer needs.

I assume they would be customers because they often work in conflict zones and unstable regions.<p>Another customer was affiliated with Apple. I suppose it'd be useful to keep tabs on things like the political situation in Thailand, where some suppliers might be located. If some major upheaval were possible, they'd want some warning, so they could start finding possible alternate suppliers.<p>While Stratfor's site is down, you might get an idea of what that sort of organization does by looking at the Jane's website, or the Economist Intelligence Unit's site.",1324875876

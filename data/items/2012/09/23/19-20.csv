The 2x2 block matrix decomposition corresponds to viewing a (2n)x(2n) matrix as a 2x2 matrix over the ring of nxn matrices. There isn't any notion of evaluation for a 2x2 matrix ring, but we might look for other natural ring homomorphisms. The determinant and trace seem like obvious candidates. Unfortunately, the determinant respects multiplication but not addition, and the trace respects addition but not multiplication.

4561807,comment,4560399,4560433,1,0,sedachv,,,"> As a simple thing, imagine an LLVM or Javascript virtual machine implemented in reconfigurable hardware and how much faster that would make it.<p>We don't have the benchmarking data, but I strongly suspect that these kinds of implementations will actually be significantly slower than what compilers are capable of doing on x86-64. This is almost certainly going to be true for stack-based VMs (stack operations are ridiculously slow compared to registers, and because the push/pop sequence done by instructions is implicit and linear you can't take advantage of any parallelization techniques like superscalar execution, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, and even pipelining is less effective).<p>Even for register-based ones the obvious things like type checking are actually extremely efficient on modern processors (I wrote an explanation on Quora: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-is-a-lisp-machine-and-what-is-so-great-about-them/answer/Patrick-Thomson/comment/574576"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-is-a-lisp-machine-and-what-is-so-g...</a>).<p>To get the same level of performance as modern CPUs you really need to take advantage of all the parallelization techniques I mentioned above. This is extremely difficult to design because you need to ensure all the permutations that are possible in valid instruction sequences produce the correct results in the presence of all the reordering/parallel execution going on. Modern CPUs actually have a lot of bugs that are found relating to this, but they only occur in very unusual code, and these bugs are fixed either by patching the microcode on the CPUs or by the OS, so you rarely encounter them. And this despite the amazingly thorough testing and huge amounts of formal verification that go into CPU designs.<p>I think FPGA-based designs will continue to be very algorithm specific for those reasons, even if we get FPGAs everywhere.",1348428901

Having understood the pros and cons of their design; they begin to code. This process generally works most of the time; but there are times when you go mid way and then change the design or might consider another alternative(like data-structures); this generally happens when you've missed some problem space to analyze earlier while planning. None-the-less; planning well ahead of time; before you begin coding helps get a good product and helps save a lot of time, money and effort.<p>Bad programmers on the other hand know about their Destination(goal) but do not know how to get there; they simply jump into coding hoping that they would someday get to their destination.

Preventive healthcare aided by the use of mobile health monitors that automatically track and log personal health metrics is another big opportunity and will likely be the biggest revolution in healthcare in over a century if it takes hold.<p>I am just a little surprised there is not more discussion around here on healthcare related startups.

4561747,comment,4560691,4561713,1,0,saurik,,,"That is not possible as written, because the ""defmacro"" is not executed to define the macro until after the outer let is already executing, which is after macro expansion of that form (and thereby its children), as it has already been read: so what I get for that is a really weird error that I'm passing too many arguments to ""foo"", as if it were a function (which it is not; albeit I'm not certain what it <i>is</i> ;P).<p>However, I can use the def-inline that I wrote in the edit to my earlier reply to demonstrate that if you reorganized this code in a way that was semantically equivalent but hoisted the macro, it would work the way you think it should: the definition of the thing from the let surrounding the macro-ish definition is used, not the one from the call site (or the global one in the namespace).<p><pre><code>    (defmacro def-inline [[name & args] code]\n        `(defmacro ~name ~(apply vector args)\n            ~code))\n\n    (def thing ""outer thing"")\n    (let [thing ""middle thing""]\n        (def-inline [foo prefix]\n            (str prefix thing)))\n    (let [thing ""inner thing""]\n        (prn (foo ""should say middle thing: "")))\n</code></pre>\n""should say middle thing: middle thing""<p>(edit:) Oh, that wasn't semantically equivalent, as the second let is not inside of the first. However, if I do that, I get the same behavior as I get in the other case (that it doesn't actually expand the macro at all and treats the form as a function call), as I'm obviously just defining the macro again inside of the same already-read form in which I'm using it.<p>(further:) Okay, and the reason why that is working is that the way I wrote def-inline inlined the code from def-inline into the macro itself. That is probably not what you wanted from def-inline: this is more like def-const (or def-static or something). I thereby tried doing this instead:<p><pre><code>    (let [thing ""middle thing""]\n        (defmacro foo [prefix]\n            `(str ~prefix thing)))\n    (let [thing ""inner thing""]\n        (prn (foo ""should say middle thing: "")))\n</code></pre>\nThis, in fact, does <i>not</i> return the ""correct"" string: instead, it fails to work at all, as the ""thing"" used inside of the macro is supposedly not defined (and worse, if I have a global def for ""thing"", I get that value). So, this is is a case where the macro is unable to use bindings that are local to the time when the macro definition is executed: it can only deal with global-ish names.<p>For the record, I think that is unrelated to what I normally think of with relation to hygiene: the macro is able to modify the code using it without accidental capture, but humorously it, itself, is unable to take advantage of symbols that have been bound locally around it. I totally accept that this is probably a flaw (I only say ""probably"" as I'm willing to believe someone from Clojure can convince me otherwise; it certainly <i>seems</i> like a flaw, though).<p>(more:) I am increasing the weight of that ""probably"", as I'm noting that the person calling this code has absolutely no way to refer to the thing that I have access to: there is no path no matter how complex or awesome that would let it refer to my ""middle thing"". I can inline it with ~, but then it isn't a binding anymore; however, that's <i>actually equivalent</i>, as Clojure does not have setf: ""thing"" is a constant, and so even if I had a function inside of this let closed over that thing, I couldn't modify its value.",1348427298

If you do want to derive it from something akin to a password.<p>More seriously, openssl -aes-256-cbc does not do any integrity protection; in fact, an attacker can more or less flip any bits of his choosing in the ciphertext to flip those same bits in the plaintext.

The explanation appears to be that these are sales from outside the US made on the Amazon.com website, but I fail to understand why that should affect my royalty rates. So Amazon's strange compartmentalization is at fault again. The net effect is that my actual royalty rate drops to about 64% of the sale price.

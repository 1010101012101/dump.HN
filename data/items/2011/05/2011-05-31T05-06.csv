My reason for this assumption is that in some cases (I think it depends on card provider), instead of typing in the password, you just type in 3 specified characters from it (e.g. ""please enter the 3rd, 5th and 6th characters""), certainly this is the case for my Visa debit cards from Barclays.<p>Is there any way they could verify a single character against a hash, or am I right in thinking it has to be stored plain text?<p>So many websites have annoyingly dumb password rules, just yesterday I was told that my ""use this on a bunch of sites I don't really care about"" password (which is long and contains upper/lower/numeric/special characters) couldn't be used because it had ""recurring letters"", i.e. the same letter was next to itself in one occasion.

2601540,comment,2601069,2601315,70,0,thaumaturgy,,,"That's outdated advice, unfortunately. You can't do this with most hard drives anymore. To use one of my most-loathed manufacturers as an example (and the worst offender when it comes to hard drive recoveries), Western Digital stores head calibration data in two places: in the system area on the platters, and in an eprom on the circuit board. Both sets of data are matched at the factory and have to stay matched.<p>You can replace the circuit board on a WD drive with a match from the exact same model, from the same factory, manufactured the same day (guessing by the serial number anyway), and the drive will still fail to give you your data back.<p>When the system area becomes unreadable or doesn't match the contents of the eprom on the controller board, WD drives will show up in BIOS with a generic model name and no other information about the drive. There's no easy way to coax them into cooperating.<p>If you're lucky, you have one of the WD models with an accessible eprom on the controller board, and you <i>might</i> be able to either desolder and swap it with the replacement board, or, if you have the appropriate equipment, use a special clothespin-like tool to latch on to the chip's pins, read its data out, and write that to the donor board. If you're unlucky, the eprom is integrated into another chip, and nothing short of some pretty expensive equipment will be able to handle it.<p>However, at this point, almost everyone that doesn't work at a professional data recovery lab is waaaay over their heads, and only making the recovery job harder (or impossible) for the lab.<p>Additionally, a lot of WD drives now have the head stack spindle mounted by a screw to the top cover; once you pull the top cover, you've lost the head calibration for the drive. Getting any data off the platters at all at that point requires a moderately expensive homebrew tool with several calipers that screws into the head stack spindle; you manually adjust calibration until data starts coming in reliably.<p>We no longer do physical data recoveries in our shop; about the end of last year these piece-of-crap drives started coming in, and none of the old tricks worked on them. We looked into the equipment (and subsequent training) required to do these sorts of recoveries, with an eye towards providing very-low-cost recoveries (since we have plenty of other revenue streams), and we simply can't afford the initial $15,000 outlay for it.<p>We've made it our mission this year to get effective data backups working for every single one of our clients.<p>TL;DR: swapping controller boards and other tricks no longer work. You really really really need to have backups.",1306821089
2601539,comment,2601323,2601323,9,0,jfruh,,,"The comments that ""Karin"" is leaving on her own status updates strike me (caveat: I am not a mental health professional, though my parents both are!) as fairly classic paranoid (like, actually diagnosably paranoid) talk.  Delusions of persecution via secret networks operating within complicated bureaucracies, interspersed with violent imagery, is pretty much what paranoids spend their time thinking about.  500 years ago they probably would have given you an elaborate description about all the different kinds of demons in hell; now it's all about the CIA and the Bilderberg Group or (in this case) international academia.<p>Anyway, long story short, my guess is that this isn't spam/CEO gaming at all, but a mentally ill human being.

2601415,comment,2601069,2601261,12,0,billforsternz,,,"My best ""open stuff up and make them do things it was not intended for"" war story is from 1988. I had just purchased a Mephisto 68000 dedicated chess computer for my own recreational enjoyment. The embedded dev lab where I worked won a new contract and the hardware dudes decided a 68000 was the way to go. Not content to wait weeks, maybe months for first hardware, I decided to get some early experience by hacking at my chess computer. Basically I opened it up, reverse engineered the keyboard scanning hardware (which was implemented with standard jellybean CMOS logic), and commandeered a couple of inputs and outputs for my own purposes. I hooked these up to the printer port of my PC.\<p>Then I worked out a simple serial bit twiddling scheme to exchange bytes a bit at a time and coded it up in C as a kind of software serial port. On the PC side I ended up with something that looked just like a simple terminal that happened to talk out the printer port. On the Mephisto side, I replaced the 64K byte EPROM with a 128K byte EPROM. I changed the cold boot vector to point at ""my"" 64K, which first checked to see if the printer port was hooked up. If it was hooked up, then the CPU stayed in ""my"" area and ran a monitor I had coded up for the occasion. If it wasn't hooked up it vectored back to the original boot code and the chess computer worked as well as it ever did. I layered a loader on top of everything and had the incredible satisfaction of running standard C sieve of Erasthonese (sp?) on my new 68K computer, (complete with 16K RAM).<p>Ah good times. Pretty hard to do stuff like this today when everything gets packaged into mega chips, not to mention the tiny scale of everything these days.",1306818592

Even IC's can be removed it just takes different tools (i.e. solder pot, hot air pen, hot plate, etc).<p>I assure you there is no difference between troubleshooting old tech and newer stuff its just different.  An IC is just that an ""integrated circuit"", meaning they just took what used to be an entire daughter board and made it on a silicon chip.  I would actually argue that it could be easier in some cases to find an issue on newer stuff since if a chip is failed you just replace it (if you can get it, which is the real problem).<p>It's just like he said in the article use the datasheets if you don't have a schematic typically they are just using some circuit that someone designed 20 years ago and put in the datasheet as an example.<p>I understand the labor cost involved in fixing an item but I would argue the long term cost of replacement/improper disposal (even recycling...have you seen the little kids with the campfires of circuit boards in india/africa that are trying to reclaim the valuable metals...that is the cost I am talking about).<p>As an electronics tech I can tell you that I have worked on many complex circuits in the field and in production and I have never had a problem with the complexity...but I have had many issues with finding ""one off"" IC's and schematics.<p>Things are not always about money...sometimes its best to fix things just to fix them (and hopefully learn something at the same time).<p>Also, consumer electronics are built to fail.

These are serious, and I don't want to dispute any of them. But I do want to point out a positive consequence.<p>Recently I needed to stay for two weeks in Princeton, New Jersey for a mathematics conference. I learned to my horror that the only hotel within walking distance of the university is uber-fancy, and costs like $200 a night. If it wasn't for services like AirBNB (I used Craigslist, but would use AirBNB now), I would have had to pay $2800 for accomodation, or rent a car which I would have otherwise had no use for. (Or perhaps there are other options of which I am ignorant.)<p>Pardon my cynicism, but this is what I believe the people living in Princeton want. They enjoy the small town ambiance, even if it is vaguely faked, and presumably through their city council they push strong zoning regulations which make it impossible to build hotels, and therefore impractical to visit on business.<p>(N.B. None of this is even remotely unique to Princeton, but that is the one experience I have personally had which sticks out.)<p>There is a flip side to this (if I bought a $500K house perhaps I would want strict zoning too), but I still hate it. With AirBNB, rentals cost what the market will bear. AirBNB is bringing good old-fashioned free market capitalism where, IMHO, it belongs. I hope they are a wild success.",1306818541

In Baton Rouge, there is a local chain of coffee houses called CC's that serve much better brew. The mom-and-pop shops do pretty well, too.",1187009461

Everyone has his or her own purpose for using facebook, and on that acccount I won't question anyones reason for using facebook.<p>The real question which most people fail to ask themselves is are those purposes for connecting enduring. Initially it will always seem so to most people, but what about next month or next year when you've graduated or left your job. Those purpose that existed before will no longer be there. Will people be constantly finding new purposes to stay connected when you no longer desire to go to party's or have a project to  complete. From that point of view its no different in the college era as much as in the...well how should i put this...real life era.<p>But thats the long term view of the utility of facebook which most people cannot see.",1187008681

That's one way to find out who's who.<p>My real problem with any form of digital communication (social networking, email, voicemail, text, etc.) is that NONE OF THEM ARE SUITABLE REPLACEMENTS FOR GENUINE HUMAN INTERACTION.  Is it any coincidence that the Facebook generation is also the Xanax generation?\n",1187008556

Life is built of selective information that we acqiure, and often we are better off from the things we don't know as much as the things we do know.<p>Do you really want to be informed about friends who get married, but don't invite you to there wedding because your not in there inner circle, but exist in there pesudo friendship circle acqiured in college and maintained only through the convience of facebook. Or do you want to constantly read about friends who achieve certain success while you have not, or maybe the other way around, your successful and happy, and there not. <p>Such information I believe is better left to passing chance encounters as we all move on in our own lives after college or a particular job when we used facebook to stay connected.<p>your point on staying connected in given stages of peoples life is well taken, but other then close family and friends do you really want to know all that goes on in peoples lives when you should be busy living your own.",1187007242

I suspect they said 'tier 3' and not '3 tier' (well for me its the only possibility that makes sense) which would mean a database with relaxed SLA requirements (probably 99.9% uptime, up to 1sec latency, things like that).

2498966,comment,2498334,2498924,4,0,leoc,,,"I didn't suggest that Mozilla has sole control over the HTML (etc.) standards. It's one of the five browser vendors who collectively have <i>de facto</i> control over the Web platform, and it's one of the four non-MS browser vendors who collectively have <i>de facto</i> control over ""open Web standards"". Thus, for instance, the reason that Google Native Client is not set fair to become an ""open Web standard"" is because three of the four non-MS vendors oppose it for reasons of self-interest. Similarly, it's going to have trouble getting real-world adoption because MS opposes it too, for basically the same reasons. You'll note how the desires or interests of other actors, like the non-browser-vendor W3C members or Web users and developers at large, play no role in the calculation.",1304110670

2498964,comment,2497360,2498463,2,0,vbtemp,,,"While I am not an expert on the shuttle flight software, these are some challenges in flight software in general: Consider the problem of orbital insertion around a moon of saturn, or around an inner planet, or an asteroid.  Not only does the guidance and control subsystem have to react (i.e., actuate the thrusters whose thrust can vary by orders of magnitude) within a razor-thin margin, but each scientific instrument has requirements as well, and introduces its own perturbations (e.g., extension of an antenna boom causing vibrations).  Plenty of PhDs, and PhD topics to be found in this and associated problems. ANother example, consider space network links.  You can't just use TCP (it's been tried, and it simply breaks down), you need to engineer a protocol -- in fact a whole new suite of protocols -- from the ground up that provides the same reliability but over much faultier links. Although TCP is simple in concept (just ACK/NACK till you got everything, right?), 30 years of its evolution shows that it is anything but.  Both of these problems necessarily involve some bending of the mind to solve, and I image there are related ones for the folks in the manned-space sector<p>EDIT: and among other things that I'd consider important to mention, there are significant robotics challenges, autonomous behavior and decision making (with associated problems in formal model verification), along with the general high degree of fault tolerance required in just about every software (and hardware) subsystem. I think many of the hardest problems in CS can be found in the spaceflight domain.",1304110588

It was open, and became increasingly popular, but, probably, <i>still:</i>  It exists to do what it wants to do.  I.e., it serves its own interests.<p>In that sense, pg has been quite -- perhaps incredibly -- accommodating.  The world came and ""spammed"" his cool, informative, high signal/noise site.<p>He's tweaked and beaten back the worst of the, erm, ""side effects"" of this.  I don't know him, but in my therefore somewhat uninformed impression, this is work he is willing to do, perhaps because it preserves the value he and parties he's concerned about find in the site.<p>But... He's not trying to sell you anything -- well, not anything about HN, per se.  So, if a bunch of UI and instructions don't drive his own needs and goals, you can forget about them.<p>If people don't track and respond to comments, well, that also means a lot of... ""defensive"" comments that don't get made and therefore don't have to be policed.  (I'm just... not even speculating, I'm making up one hypothetical result.)<p>I'm not writing this to defend the decisions, overly.  Rather, to explain a bit of my own perspective on HN and perhaps how it might help a reader of this comment better relate to the site.<p>Sometimes, too, I find myself more in favor of such apparent decisions after I've observed for a while.  When HN is not <i>too</i> accommodating, it may discourage some of those participants who make other sites increasingly into crapfests.",1304110361

Once a project has matured enough, some amount of code review, done incrementally, shouldn't be a burden. At that point, if you're typing out reams of code every day, you might be doing it wrong ( something code review could help catch [ e.g., ""Library X does this; you don't have to re-implement it"" ] ).  The point would <i>not</i> be to circle back after 100 hours of work to review, but rather every (say) 10.<p>I don't agree that source code is not meant to be examined ( but maybe we work in totally different fields ). I regularly read source code from my coworkers, and they regularly have to read mine. Often, the developer who wrote the code is not available for questions, or isn't with the company any longer. My own code might as well have been written by another developer if I look at it after about a year. All these issues could be mitigated or muted by another set of eyes, either by sharing the knowledge ( ""Why did Bob do this?"" might be answered by someone else who'd reviewed the code ) or by asking the questions initially ( ""Bob, why did you do it that way?"" Bob: ""Because of X -- I'll leave a comment in the source ).",1304109359

Look at who's leading the recovery - the companies reporting large profits without much increased sales, if any. I.e. increased productivity and efficiency, less waste. The waste in the business is still extremely large, yet much smaller than compare to heydays of 2005-7. Instead of being wasted, at least some part of these profits would get invested and thus would spread around in the  economy and help overall recovery.",1304107735

2498783,comment,2497360,2497360,64,0,anonLSD,,,"I offer some of the highlights of my personal experience with LSD, anonymously, due to the very unfortunate stigma. I'm very positive on its ability to unlock potential, trigger insights, expand perspective, and facilitate learning, even in spite of having experienced a few bad trips. Although the experience is deeply personal, I'll try to offer the most concrete accounts I can.<p>First, of all the hundreds of little insights, interesting trains of thought, and connections made between previously unrelated ideas, there is one revelation in particular that floats to the top of my mind. It's this: LSD confronts you, in an extremely visceral way, with the fact that the entire universe that you perceive and interact with, the whole world and everybody in it, is entirely in your own mind at all times. Sure, it's perfectly reasonable to believe that it's all derived from an objective, external world - but you've never interacted directly with that one, and in fact you can't.<p>Now, you might say that you already ""know"" this, philosophically. You can even do the smug, Internet know-it-all thing and say this is completely pedestrian, name-drop Descartes and a bunch of other philosophers, and hit me with a zinger about how this is about as deep as ""The Matrix"". But I'm not claiming that LSD leads you to the philosophical idea; I'm saying that it slaps you right in the face with it, viscerally. It doesn't tell you, so that you have to think about it in the abstract; it shows you, literally with your own eyes. It's the difference between knowing what the Grand Canyon looks like from pictures, and standing on the edge of it.<p>It is very common for people to describe the onset of their first trip in terms of waking up, for the first time, ever. I'd describe it this way, too. It feels like waking up for the first time, and realizing that you'd been dreaming your whole life. Of course, this is really just an analogy, and it's more than just a feeling. It's a sudden shift in your actual perceptual processes, which are largely chemical, and have now been altered. But by the mere fact of them being altered, you realize that the default way of perceiving is just that - just a default. It isn't more ""true"" or more ""real"" - it's a default, it's massively culturally constructed, and it's characterized by a certain amount of non-questioning of assumptions. What's a color? What's a country? What's a ""week""? What's a leader? What is solid? Which way is up? What's a job? Your brain starts trying to decompose every concept into basic principles, and you realize that for a lot of things in the human world, there are none. Just made-up, widespread beliefs that cause lots of people to act as-if, and in so doing, make them ""real"".  Again, there is a difference between merely realizing this philosophically, and being transported outside of the web of culturally-reinforced beliefs and observing it from the outside.<p>So there's a lot of shedding of constructed concepts. What's left when all that chaff blows away? Whatever it is, it a) seems a lot more real, and b) is obscured in normal consciousness. I'm not suggesting that it would be desirable to permanently lose the ability to think on the level of appointments, check-writing, stop-lights, prospectuses, and the rest of the ""mundane"". I am definitely suggesting that what is left of experience after all that is obliterated from consciousness is worth seeing. There are parallels here with Buddhism and enlightenment traditions. It's also extremely common for people to offer meditation as a substitute. It's perfectly fine if you don't want to do illegal drugs - hardly anyone will fault you. But don't fool yourself that you're getting the same effect. I've practiced meditation too, and while it does alter consciousness, there are many meaningfully different altered states - they are in no way equivalent or substitutable. (Think about it - if you can simulate an LSD trip by meditating, do you simulate a K trip by meditating differently? Can you meditate yourself to a heroin high by a different technique? LSD isn't just another interchangeable ""enlightened"" state - they're all specific in their sets of effects. I have no doubt that I too have missed out on plenty of profound experiences by not taking, doing, seeing, or achieving any number of things. It's a big world.)<p>Sadly, this is turning into a wall of text, and I could still go on for the rest of the day. So, I'm going to force myself to wrap up with just a few more short highlights:<p>* I learned OpenGL while tripping. The subjective experience was of the information slipping into my brain effortlessly. Normally, I have to read sentences and paragraphs multiple times for them to ""sink in"". That time, I just skimmed, and understood. The next day, sober, I wrote a couple of neat height-field/terrain programs in OpenGL. Of course we've all learned dozens of even more complicated topics without any drugs, so this anecdote is meaningless, right? All I'm talking about is what it <i>felt like</i> to learn it. It felt effortless by comparison to the way I normally learn. Placebo? Selective memory? Your other favorite bias? Might be interesting to know definitively - but I still had a really good time that night.<p>* I once won a game of Mastermind on the first turn, without making any other guesses. This seriously freaked out the other people at the table. I wasn't tripping at the time, but I was in a distinctly ""trippy"" mentality - so much so that I was having a mini-flashback by the end of the turn. What I had done was to realize that the room was a closed system, containing the information about the winning pattern, and that as part of that system, I might have access to the information via other channels. Basically, I just paid very close attention to the other person's body language as I fingered different colored pegs, and allowed him to inadvertently ""tell"" me the correct colors and order.<p>* I once did a drawing of a woman from the neck up, while tripping. When I started drawing her hair, I got lost. I was drawing hair for what seemed like hours. I was hiding dozens of other, nested, drawings inside the texture of the hair. It still looked more or less like hair, but if you really looked at it, it was teeming with a whole bunch of unrelated drawings. Sure, I could do the same thing now, but it had never before occurred to me to try that. There is something about tripping that is inherently amenable to that kind of recursive, fractal thinking.<p>In short, don't knock subjective experiences. The enjoyment of music is a subjective experience, is it not?",1304107642

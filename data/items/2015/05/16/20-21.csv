9557572,comment,9557122,9557512,0,0,DanAndersen,,,"I definitely think it would be possible. I find it interesting to think about eyesight in the same way -- even though an image is projected onto our retinas, there&#x27;s not a little homunculus looking at our retinas to see the image; it gets translated into electrical signals that our brain interprets. There seems to be a great amount of plasticity in the brain that lets us remap senses and view tools as extensions of our bodies.<p>There has been some prior work on using depth cameras for navigation for the visually impaired. For example, a smart cane can detect objects beyond its reach and give haptic feedback. Microsoft Research did some work with putting the Kinect on a helmet and giving audio cues for navigation (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/184208/VisionForTheBlind.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/184208/VisionForTheBlind....</a>). What I&#x27;m interested in is taking that sensory input and making it less immediate by giving it a memory -- letting it build up a picture of an environment rather than needing to point a device at something in order to know something about it.<p>One big issue is figuring out how to sonify depth information so it&#x27;s useful. One simple approach is to do a sort of sweep across each frame from left to right, letting each row of an image correspond to a certain pitch. I don&#x27;t think this is a good approach, as it seems very vision-oriented and is likely to sound just like noise. Maybe if someone was using it from birth, but for relatively fast training I doubt that approach. Other approaches do more interpretation -- Microsoft&#x27;s work detected faces, walls, and floors, giving each a distinct sound for greater recognition.",1431809574

9557568,comment,9556654,9556654,0,0,interesting_att,,,"A lot of people in this thread have moral qualms with slot machines. I know I did. However, I have since been heavily involved in the industry (not of my choosing), and have been able to better understand it. The slot industry is not the epitome of evil.<p>1) Slots can be fun- Most people think slots are bad because they are &quot;addicting&quot;. They conclude that these machines are addicting in large part because they themselves can&#x27;t wrap their heads why ANYONE would spend so much money on a game without some serious mental disorder. But that completely ignores the actual voices of the users (who slot designers actually talk to). Players actually enjoy the thrills of winning AND losing. We have to come to grips that what others consider fun is sometimes beyond our realm of imagination. And just because we don&#x27;t understand the thrill of their experience, doesn&#x27;t mean the machine is tricking them. I don&#x27;t see most people confused when their 75 year old grandmother doesn&#x27;t like Call of Duty.<p>2) Spending lots of money on slots isn&#x27;t necessarily a symptom of addiction- I have met so many people (Completely normal, wealthy people) who have a limit of spending $30/day on slots in their spare time. That is, they spend around 10k/year on slots. Anyone seeing 10k/year would think that this person was addicted, but they don&#x27;t measure his/her background. Slot players tend to be older, they tend to spend on little else (they don&#x27;t go out to bars!), tend to have a good amount of free time, and tend to have a good bit of savings. They - of all people- should be allowed to play slots if they so choose to. Obviously the money society spends on slots would be better used to feed some starving child or build some fancy new lifesaving technology. But that&#x27;s more of a critique of capitalism, not just slots.<p>3) Casinos don&#x27;t target gambling addicts- Of course slot makers do basic A/B testing of their games. But it&#x27;s not like casinos put ads outside of Gambling Addicts Anonymous meetings. They target people in general, and gambling addicts will always find a way too them. When do we start placing the responsibility on the end user?<p>4) Is the rate of problem gamblers (gamblers who spend a lot of money and can&#x27;t) who use slot machines higher than the rate of alcoholics? Shopping addicts? Drug addicts? Do you suggest banning alcohol because some people can&#x27;t handle it?<p>5) Casinos and slots are <i>heavily</i> regulated by what they can and cannot do. Moreover, taxes on casinos do go to fund problem gambling help, schools, and a lot of great other things.<p>In the end, unless you actually take an effort to learn how to enjoy slots, you won&#x27;t understand why people like it. And because of that, you will just vilify the industry. Eerily similar to the war on drugs.",1431809449

In our language there is no direct substitute for the question &quot;Are you happy?&quot; I can ask &quot;are you sick, hungry, lost, fast, slow, smart, bad, good, angry,etc..,&quot; but I have no easy straight way of asking &quot;Are you happy?&quot;<p>That is not to say people are happy, that is just to say the words/questions shape the culture.<p>On Material Deprivation<p>On the other hand I noticed the difference between my status and my friends. I had friends I would not bring to my home as a kid; these kids would spend on clothes what was our family&#x27;s monthly income. Material deprivation is entirely subjective nevertheless. I also had cousins, family friends, who found our home the best place to be during their holidays. They would usually live in more remotes part of the country or in the suburbs, not the main city.<p>On Material Deprivation<p>&quot;Appearance starts where performance ends.&quot; I notice the times one finds hope or purpose bigger than themselves (even if temporarily) they do not care so much about appearance. Take the average startup entrepreneur. They could live in a shack and be content if they were confident they had the next Facebook in hand. On the other hand they could land a job at Google for $250k yearly and be miserable because their goal was to build a unicorn. To this end whenever I worry about appearances, I know internally something is lacking. Something deeper. It happens on and off, I realize it.<p>&quot;Ignorance is really bliss&quot;<p>I have noticed something: philosophers and analytical minds seem unhappy, religious minds seem just accepting, and those who &quot;do not appear&quot; very intelligent are having a freaking good time in life.",1431809073

Even if we opened more residency positions, we&#x27;d still need more medical schools too, right? Because 412 doctors isn&#x27;t enough to make a dent in the status quo.<p>Well, for starters, some of that is self-selecting, in that the only people who feel they are competitive candidates for a residency even apply. Overall, there are about 15,000 more applicants than first-year residency positions as of last year - 40,394 total.<p>Also, that 412 number is looking at the people who didn&#x27;t <i>match</i>, which isn&#x27;t actually the same as saying how many were &quot;unaccepted&quot;. Residencies don&#x27;t work like undergraduate admissions. The residency matching is a complicated two-way process that separates by field, so the 412 aggregate number isn&#x27;t actually answering the same question. This is implied by the discussion of primary care residencies halfway down the article you link, but if you&#x27;re not already familiar with the process, you wouldn&#x27;t notice it.<p>Finally, that is only looking at students <i>in the United States</i> who did not match. Many residents in the US attended medical school outside the US. In fact, it&#x27;s very common for US students who don&#x27;t get into medical school in the US to go to medical schools in the Caribbean instead, and then come back to the US to do their residency so they can practice in their home country.<p>> I mean, we&#x27;ll need another 412 doctors just to account for population growth in a couple years.<p>The number of residency programs is increasing, so population growth isn&#x27;t the concern. The original topic of discussion was increasing the availability of doctors - in other words, increasing the number of residency programs by an order of magnitude, rather than incrementally, as has occurred almost every year since 1952.",1431806650

At present we see a pattern of young brash founders who are misogynistic and disrespectful getting their way. Per the persistence of the patterns this  kind of behavior is becoming normalized as being okay in society&#x27;s eyes, one way to stop this is to do anything we can to stigmatize the non-consensual peeing on women, the violation of people&#x27;s privacy, etc. It&#x27;s by saying it&#x27;s bad.

9557417,comment,9555295,9557203,0,0,ncallaway,,,"I would argue that wealth redistribution (which UBI absolutely is) is not a zero sum game.<p>First, let&#x27;s talk about utility. Utility of capital is non-linear. So, if we take $100 out of a millionaire&#x27;s pocket, and distribute it evenly to 10 people who each have $100. The millionaire&#x27;s ability to contribute to society has decreased by 10 units. The ten other members of society each had their ability to contribute to society increase by 2 units. We&#x27;ve generated a net-gain for society by redistributing wealth.<p>Second, we can look at the dollar value of the system. Yes, I would argue that even the dollar value of this redistribution is not a zero sum game. Obviously the basic transfer of wealth was zero sum. But it made our enonomy slightly more efficient by improving the capacity of the 10 citizens. Let&#x27;s say the economy grows $10 more than it would have without the redistribution. Suddenly, even in just dollar-value the redistribution was not zero-sum.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that UBI is a response to extreme income inequality, which can cause large ineffeciencies in a market. Automation obsoleting jobs only needs to lead to UBI <i>if that automation leads to rising income inequality</i>. If we find a way to work with technology that keeps income disparities at a reasonable and efficient value, then there&#x27;s no need for UBI. However, income inequality has reached to pretty significant heights and continues to grow.",1431806550

A new model is needed, and that new model would have all the relevant attributes. I can think of two ways to do this (using ActiveRecord-ish naming conventions).<p>One way would be to have an InvoiceRow to represent the presentational details of each row in an Invoice, like name and price, perhaps along with a reference to the actual model it came from, like product_id. The Product model could change, but the Invoice would still have all the InvoiceRows it needs to display and reason about that invoice without fear of mutation.<p>Another way would be to have a robust versioning system. So a Product might have only an id, and there could be many ProductVersions that hold all the real info (name, price, etc.) and reference the same Product via product_id. ProductVersions would of course be immutable. Then the Order model in the example would return product_version_id, and could therefore look up the actual name and price at the time the order was made.<p>For the narrow example from this article, I think the first example fits better and is much simpler.",1408489024

To add to this, I found the post perplexing considering that REST also has cache constraints as described at <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch...</a>. This makes some statements in the article strange. For example: &quot;Very rarely will a RESTful URL specify an Expires header . . .&quot; Leaving aside that Expires is not the only cache header http offers (see <a href=""http://odino.org/rest-better-http-cache/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://odino.org/rest-better-http-cache/</a> for others), the main problem with this statement is that it suddenly makes the system he is describing not-quite-RESTful. It raises the question are you really in a RESTful style if you throw your hands up and ignore the cache part of the style. I would say that ignoring cache is an assumption that Dziuba is making which partly results in the problem he describes, along with having incorrect domain modeling. Restore the cache piece to the system and it would be able to deal with the stale-price-problem just fine by noticing that the price is stale and requesting a fresh one.",1408488850

Walk up to someone calling themselves &quot;Roman&quot; in 1 AD and you could find yourself talking to a pagan born in modern Italy who spoke Latin. Walk up to someone calling themselves &quot;Roman&quot; 500 years later and you could be talking to a Christian born in modern Turkey who spoke Greek, which is a very very different person. But both of them would have insisted that they were &quot;Roman.&quot; (The idea of &quot;Byzantium&quot; itself as something distinct from the Roman Empire is a purely modern construction -- no Byzantine would have conceived of themselves as such.) So the idea of &quot;Romanness&quot; was socially constructed; it meant whatever people living in the empire at a particular time collectively decided it meant.<p>You can see a similar type of socially constructed identity by looking at &quot;whiteness&quot; in American culture. 150 years ago, a &quot;white American&quot; was strictly interpreted as a person of northern European (&quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;) descent. English, French, Germans and Scandinavians were &quot;white people&quot;; Spaniards, Italians, Irish, Poles, Russians and Jews were not. But fast-forward to today, and all those latter ethnicities are now commonly identified as &quot;white&quot; in American culture.<p>In other words, whiteness, like Romanness, is less a fixed identifier of a particular ethnic/religious/linguistic configuration and more a convenient way for people to divide the world into in-groups and out-groups, &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;",1408488474

I don&#x27;t recall there being one.<p>A draft has nothing at all to do with whether the invasion in 2003 was a legal use of armed force or not, under U.S. domestic law or international law. If that invasion was illegal without the draft, then it was also illegal with a draft. Being a conscript doesn&#x27;t make your participation in an otherwise illegal invasion magically legal.<p>But. Even if you disagree (as I do) with the justification for invading in Iraq in 2003, there are and were plenty of legitimate reasons for U.S. forces to be there to restore security after the U.S. fucked everything up.<p>In fact, the current government of Iraq and the Kurdish pesh merge invited the U.S. back in to conduct air strikes to beat back ISIS (who prominently came to power after the U.S. military left...), much to the acclaim of practically the entire world, including the U.N., including Pope Francis, including Iraqis themselves.

By my (limited) reckoning, even if they can get their design to work in theory, I think they&#x27;re grossly underestimating the materials requirements for the fusion reactor.<p>From what I recall, one of the big problems that any reactor project has is that the reaction has a tendency to destroy the reaction chamber.  Not just the heat, but the neutron radiation can completely screw up the reaction chamber walls, which then need replacing.  It&#x27;s one of the reasons the ITER project is so large, to make it relatively robust in the face of such destructive power.  I also remember reading a while back that the force from the electromagnets in the ITER project is sufficient to launch the entire reaction chamber off the ground, something like 5000 tons...<p>Having said that, I think it&#x27;s cool that they&#x27;re attempting it and I think that fusion projects have been grossly underfunded in the past.

Transfer logic to the client\n2. Put the client in charge with modifying the state\n3. Lack Behavioral APIs.<p><pre><code>  Too many people assume RESTful services are these simplistic services that return JSON objects, which are then modified by the client and PUT back on the server.  This isn&#x27;t the case.  When you request a resource (think object) from a RESTful service, it doesn&#x27;t just send you its state.  It sends you its state and metadata describing the interface in which you can interact with this resource.  If you we were talking about an HR database, requesting an employee object would not only return the employee&#x27;s data, it would also include relevant metadata on how to request vacation days.  That operation is not a PUT operation, it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;d POST a vacation-request message to a URL that would start some sort of workflow.\n\n  A RESTful architecture is very good at behaving like a network file system by default, but it can also support behavioral interfaces in a RESTful way when you need them using POST.  You may be familiar with the CQRS architecture, which explicitly separates commands from queries when designing APIs.  The idea is anything queries your system should *never* change its state, and anything that changes the state of a system should be sent as a one-way message.  If you&#x27;ve done CQRS correctly, it should be easy to log all messages that change your system&#x27;s state similar to a database transaction log.  A RESTful architecture makes the same demands and then some more.\n</code></pre>\n1.  If you&#x27;re implementing GET, don&#x27;t modify the state.\n2.  If you&#x27;re implementing PUT, it should modify the resource addressed at the URL and it should be idempotent.\n3.  If a resource implements POST, you get none of the above guarantees.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think REST prevents behavioral API&#x27;s so much as it demands that anything behavioral is POSTed as command-based message.",1408486302

It has nothing to do with forces needing anything. This was a free-for-all giveaway. It&#x27;s all political.<p>2) In defense of DoD, once you build this crap, it&#x27;s gotta go somewhere. Maybe some of these MRAPs could only be used for local parades. Local PDs do not need this junk, but the rest of the country doesn&#x27;t need it either. Better dumping it on Deputy Joe than letting it rot. As long as Joe doesn&#x27;t start getting delusions of terrorism.<p>3) A lot of the local rural counties where I live got M16s. I guess that seems useful. The M16 is a fine rifle, and if you could get every one of your cops a proven rifle it sure beats trying to get the poor local governments to pay for them. The cities are a different story: much better connected and with more resources (and ambition?) to screw as much out of the system as possible. The nearest city to me is getting all kinds of idiotic stuff. Do we really need 20 $4k night vision sniper scopes? Perhaps if the city were attacked by protesting vampires such a purchase would be useful. But I guess guys gotta play with their toys.<p>The distribution alone is not worth ranting about. The problem is what happens once all this junk is distributed. If you own a bear gun, you have a tendency to go out into the woods hunting bears. You also see evidence of bears where others do not. That&#x27;s the real problem.",1408485697

What does that tell a program to do? Cause instead of defining some sort of sensical behaviour (&quot;send a thousand years as never&quot;), you&#x27;ve got this odd scenario where never might be a year. Or maybe you send 2 years, and clients act improperly.<p>It seems that whoever wrote this spec wasn&#x27;t writing much software, and didn&#x27;t intent others to write software from the spec.",1408485675

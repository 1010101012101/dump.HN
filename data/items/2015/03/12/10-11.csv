Even algebraic approaches to these are formulated through discretization of a continuous model (which -- unsurprisingly -- you need calculus to study).<p>We <i>have</i> such a thing as databases, devices that can manipulate graphics and high-complexity economic models that are analyzed through linear algebra because Newton and Leibniz found the mathematical tools we need in order to model (continuous) change. We could mostly get along fine-ish without linear algebra, but the industrial revolution that spawned our society would be impossible without calculus, because without it you cannot design anything non-trivial that moves or runs on electricity.",1426157129

9189960,comment,9188920,9189141,0,0,lazyseq,,,"I build whole systems, and have had specialized jobs ranging from 3D game programming to Machine Learning to Rapid Web App Dev. I&#x27;ve observed many the opposite. I would agree that interfaces have lots of moving parts, but part of what you try to do there is to reduce the complexity because it often means you are passing on too much to the user. I suppose there&#x27;s a bit of Apple philossphy there.<p>Just cron jobs and REST APIs? Regarding cron jobs, we generally try to avoid them because communicating with them, getting good information, maintaining, and so on sucks. While I&#x27;ve written tons of cron jobs and still do, it&#x27;s probably 1% of what I&#x27;ve observed happening in the back-end and usually a sign of a duct-taped system. This excludes baked-in unix tools that are actually supposed to work that way of course, rather I am talking things directly involving apps I build. As for REST API, not everything needs to be or should be REST. It introduces all kinds of extra layers of auth, slowdown, caching issues, and so on. For some domains, REST is a bad idea. Of course we use it where it makes sense, but it&#x27;s not just some magic thing that is and should be used everywhere and anywhere to be representative of the bulk of back-end. Most REST services are built very quickly, it&#x27;s rather the logic behind them that takes a long time.<p>As for concrete things I&#x27;ve encountered that are actually complex and happen in traditionally the back-end, I&#x27;d say none of these are straight-forward:<p>1. Caching - As it goes, other than naming, this is one of the most difficult things in computer science and happens everywhere in a good application, front, back, let, right, data, service, whatever.<p>2. Machine Learning, Sentiment Analysis, Analytics, OLAP, etc. - People forget that a big part of building a system is getting information back out of it.<p>3. Orchestration - this is hugely complicated. So much so, Microsoft created a very complicated and misunderstood product for it (BizTalk). Doing orchestration is still something no one gets. It happens in millions of forms and related manifestations.<p>4. Deployment - Versioning, machine provisioning, cluster management, and so on are all very complicated. There are tons of these things that fall under what many people call Dev Ops now too as well. I have yet to see magic here in any app. I challenge you to deploy a running system that is accepting live data transactions, then seamlessly roll it back without data loss, down time, corruption, weird states, unforseen bugs, and so on. No one has done this in full which is why this area is becoming increasingly full of solutions and start-ups. Whether it&#x27;s Google App Engine, Azure, Heroku, your in-house AWS scripts, Chef, anything, I am telling you no one really does this 100% right. Supporting a real app is just as important as the app itself, and often the two have to communicate and be written in ways to make this work.<p>5. Streaming - Building streaming related back-ends is anything but simple and plug-and-play. No, I am not talking about streaming Tweets.<p>6. Data Migrations/Updates/Changes/Flow - Very important part of dev, and usually one of the top 5 time sinks. Complete nightmare and again products and libraries that help, but no magic bullets to be found here other than doing the work and putting in the time. As for simple cases, almost everyone deals with getting data in X form, transforming it to Y, and having it change form again after getting a reply from Z service. A huge part of people&#x27;s time is simply manipulating data structures, at any place in the system and a reason why I tend to favor Clojure for web apps that don&#x27;t need to be speed demons. As for migrations, ask someone to do one, then double or quadruple their estimate, sit back, and watch.<p>7. Authentication/Authorization - The world runs on more than just OAuth and Social Auth. Try dealing with people that have secure systems or many other systems that you need to communicate with, especially across network boundaries.<p>8. Legacy Integration - Happens all the time. Especially when you build a shiny new app very fast, then have to roll out v2 that actually scales. Beyond that, try any business that has been around 5+ years and actually makes money to see just how horrid this can be.<p>9. Data modeling - If the scenario of ABC person created XYZ app which now struggles to do Foo new thing without huge pains, you haven&#x27;t worked on apps long enough. Data modeling mistakes and limitations are one of the single biggest problems and time sinks. More obvious examples include simple facts like having to dupe or dump data into other places to consume it the ways people actually want. While your shiny normalized tables with a REST service might work well for returning a simple list of customers, as that list scales and you realize you now have a new place where you need 2 fields from here, 8 from there, and so on and it needs to happen in 100ms or less in total back to the user, then you are in for a treat.<p>10. Logging - in big systems, the code here can be non-trivial. Often this means more than writing to a log file, but rather providing visibility into parts of the system in real-time or close to it.<p>11. Scaling - Everyone thinks they are doing this right until they don&#x27;t do it right. This can involve anything from servers to message transport format to compression to memory management to clustering.<p>We could do this all day, but hopefully this makes a point.",1426157112

9189872,comment,9189096,9189824,0,0,peterfirefly,,,"On old Windows versions, you could get even more complicated backwards compatibility fun.<p>The 8086/8088 only had a 1MB address space that wrapped around: if you used a high enough segment value with a high enough offset, you would actually refer to the beginning of memory.<p>The 80286 had a much larger address space: a whole 16MB!  But when running in compatibility mode (where you could only refer to 1MB), the addresses no longer wrapped around.  The result was that you actually had an address space of 1MB+64KB (minus 16 bytes).  IBM wanted better compatibility than that so they found an unused AND gate in a TTL chip lying around somewhere and put the A20 signal from the CPU through that before it reached the bus.  You could then switch A20 off at will, thus getting better compatibility.  So how do you control that gate?  Well, the microcontroller on the motherboard that talks to the keyboard microcontroller has an extra pin that isn&#x27;t used for anything.  Let&#x27;s use that pin!  So you switch the A20 gate on/off by sending commands to the keyboard controller.<p>Fast forward some years.  We now have a decentish version of Windows that is basically running on top of DOS.  It has extensive compatibility with DOS in many ways: not only can it run (and multitask) DOS programs inside it, it can also use DOS device drivers and TSRs loaded before Windows.  It does this by merrily switching back and forth between so many different CPU modes that it makes you dizzy.  It needs to run with the A20 on, otherwise you would get a really funny address space where every other megabyte was inaccessible, which would be both clumsy and wasteful.  And device drivers and TSRs loaded into the 64KB right above the first megabyte would also need A20 on to run.  On the other hand, there might be other real mode code in the system that needs A20 to be off!  So Windows could switch it on and off while running.  It doesn&#x27;t quite involve the keyboard but it is close...  and sometimes a bad keyboard (with bad code in its microcontroller) would distract the microcontroller on the motherboard so much that the A20 switching was slow or even faulty.  In that case you could fix your machine by switching keyboard!",1426154633

Increasingly, liberal arts students are able to get by with no more than a &quot;math appreciation&quot; course and maybe what amounts to high school algebra.  The &quot;math appreciation&quot; course might actually touch on very neat topics for these students (mathematics of voting, etc.) so I&#x27;d say math curriculum has already been successfully reformed for them.<p>As for the average STEM student, in my experience, most freshmen wouldn&#x27;t be ready for linear algebra (unless by &quot;linear algebra&quot; you mean &quot;matrix arithmetic&quot;).  They have enough trouble understanding functions in Calculus I: linear algebra&#x27;s &quot;functions are basically matrix multiplication&quot; feature would NOT help.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is calculus has had much more impact on history/society than linear algebra.  The fundamental theorem of calculus is a legitimately earth-shattering breakthrough:  none of the theorems in linear algebra come anywhere near it in cultural importance.<p>Pragmatically, calculus is the most suitable mathematics for the type of testing-oriented, uniformizable/transferable pedagogy that a university really (in cold practical terms) must depend on for first-year students.  It would be extremely difficult to force the kind of uniformity onto linear algebra that would be necessary if you seriously want to have millions of transfer students moving around between thousands of universities every quarter, gossiping about which linear algebra teacher gives the easiest grades, etc.",1426154574

Behind Daktylos Media are the parents of three children. We&#x27;re a start up publishing house from Dresden, Germany.<p>We&#x27;ve produced our first book-app for children aged 9 years and older, who like to read. On the App Store there is plenty of games and books - we offer a very new kind of book-app which suggests to interact with the text. We call it &quot;Reading Quest&quot;.<p>The first Daktylos Reading Quest for iPad combines the story “Meta Morfoss” by Peter Hacks (1928–2003) with custom-made illustrations, animations and sounds. In this new app format, illustrations are animated by tapping keywords in the text. However, the interactive elements and child-friendly design do not distract from the text; instead they support the reading process and understanding. The app comprises three languages—German, English and Russian.<p>Highlights\n- Special book app format: Reading Quest\n- A classic of children’s literature\n- Illustrations are animated by tapping keywords in the text\n- Custom-made, hand-drawn illustrations\n- Catchy soundtrack \n- Comical sounds that make children laugh out loud\n- Integrated German, English and Russian versions\n- Child-friendly, unobtrusive design\n- No games that distract from reading\n- No “Read to me” function—motivation to independent reading<p>You find our innovative App by iTunes or Google Play with keyword META MORFOSS!<p>Enjoy!",1426154559

Personally, I come from a EU country where it is the law(Poland) so everything has to come with 2 years warranty, but living in the UK, it&#x27;s really hard to exercise the 2 year warranty given by the EU law. Basically it protects you from manufacturing defects within those 2 years, if you buy a laptop with a 1-year warranty and a hard drive dies after 1.5 years it&#x27;s still  up to you to prove that it died because of manufacturing defect, which in all likelihood you won&#x27;t be able to do.",1426154500

Having route folders labeled by their version number, then manually creating routes for each of these versioned folders.\n   e.g. routes/v1/authRoute & routes/v2/authRoute<p>2. Defining in the route which version each route specific function is for.\n   e.g. routes/auth & within auth v1: function() and v2: function<p>3. Programmatically generating the routes, based on the file structure of the routes folder\n   e.g. routes/v1/auth and routes/v1/1.0/auth would end up being /app/v1/auth and app/v1/1.0/auth<p>So really, l was wondering, how do companies from big to small actually managed this without requiring a lot of manual effort.",1426154429

Before concluding that this gig isn&#x27;t for you, at the very least, make sure you maintain your own standards of quality and responsibility to do the best you can do. Try to be flexible and work with them.  Sell them on your ideas as best as you can when you disagree with their always changing ones.  But if they disagree, I strongly advise to be flexible and don&#x27;t let the chaos shake you from your own high standards of professionalism to do the best you can.  I&#x27;m old school, but I feel you still owe that much to them since this is a contract you agreed to take on.  Who knows?

Attorney-client privilege.<p>I&#x27;m guessing most law firms use third party email servers, anti-virus, anti-spam and archive/audit systems which this would also apply to. It would also apply if you&#x27;re using Raportive, Xobni or the like (or integrated time-tracking, billing, crm, etc.).<p>-------------<p>2. By default, LinkedIn changes the content of your emails.<p>Irrelevant. Unless you read your emails in plain text every modern email client changes how email is displayed.<p>-------------<p>3. Intro breaks secure email.<p>Yes. Except iOS mail doesn&#x27;t support crypto signatures anyway.<p>-------------<p>4. LinkedIn got owned.<p>Yes. LinkedIn adds an extra point of vulnerability.<p>-------------<p>5. LinkedIn is storing your email communications.<p>Well metatdata but yes.<p>-------------<p>7. Its probably a gross violation of your companys security policy.<p>Yes. As is using Linkedin itself. Or Dropbox. Or Github. Or Evernote. Or Chrome. Or any enterprise software that uses the bottom up approach.<p>-------------<p>8. If I were the NSA<p>The NSA has access to your emails if they want them anyway. Email isn&#x27;t a secure protocol against a well funded adversary.<p>-------------<p>9. Its not what they say, but what they dont say<p>This looks like a semantic dispute, but it doesn&#x27;t look any more vague than say Google&#x27;s privacy policy. Companies in certain circumstances are legally required to provide access to information.<p>-------------<p>10. Too many secrets<p>These all seem to be questions that can either be answered by testing or ones that LinkedIn would probably be happy to disclose, but unlikely to be major issues to mainstream users.<p>-------------<p>So fundamentally it comes down to two points, granting Linkedin access to your email creates a new point of attack and Linkedin themselves might use your email in ways you find undesirable.<p>So it&#x27;s essentially a trade-off for the benefits you get from the app versus those risks. For a personal account which you use for private emails, personal banking, etc. the evaluation is obviously going to be very much different from say a salesperson&#x27;s work account which they use for managing communication with leads.<p>In the later case they may already be trusting LinkedIn with similar confidential information and already use multiple services (analytics, crm, etc.) that hook into their email so the additional relative risk might be smaller.<p>As people with technical expertise we shouldn&#x27;t use scare-mongering to push our personal viewpoints upon those with less expertise, but rather help people understand the security/benefit trade-offs that they&#x27;re making so they can decide for themselves whether to take those risks.<p>It&#x27;s important to treat the wider non-technical community with respect and as adults capable of making their own judgements and not as kids who need to be scared into safety.",1382654679

There are customer advantages:<p>1.  We could monitor drivers to make sure they do not take egregiously long routes.<p>2.  We could use the information to drive supply to the right place (for example, by telling drivers, &quot;Yes, we understand that hails are not as common in AREA, but our data indicates that when they do exist, they tend to be for rides 200% the length of the average ride).<p>3.  And there are all kinds of ways we could tune our service in response to highly detailed data about each ride.  (&quot;Avoid this road -- it&#x27;s a little shorter, but it&#x27;s massively slower!&quot;, or &quot;Driver X really knows part of city Y, let&#x27;s preferentially hail him there&quot;), though in my experience those kinds of things are hard to act on.<p>But you&#x27;re right, it is creepy, and we don&#x27;t want to be in the business of monitoring the movements of our passengers (or even our drivers, outside of in specific ways directly to do with providing a better service).  We particularly do not want to be in the position of being a good target to subpoena about the movements of a customer.<p>I think it&#x27;s possible to thread this needle, though there&#x27;s a fair amount of effort involved.

What will happen, I believe, is that over time, more and more people will gravitate to using Linux as they tire of the limited choice offered by Apple, Google and Microsoft. Hopefully, so many will that major software vendors will begin porting their stuff to Linux, at which time it will become more and more obvious for people to be using it. With Steam for Linux and SteamOS based on Linux, we&#x27;ve already seen some trickles of this in action.

We&#x27;re in the part of the technology/market growth curve where it&#x27;s easy, for some, to make a killing with comparatively little effort and innovation. The iPad mini is a perfect example, it&#x27;s mostly just iPad 2 guts with a smaller screen and battery, but they sold like crazy and made an even crazier amount of profit for Apple. And to some degree rightly so, they put a device in people&#x27;s hands that they wanted.<p>Nevertheless, when the rewards for laziness are so high what incentive is there to take on risk? There are negative incentives, in fact, because any amount of effort or resources spent pursuing something risky will likely come at the cost of working on something safer. If the safe and lazy thing is sure to bring in billions in profit then even if the risky things succeeds it might end up being a short-term loss due to opportunity cost.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that things like the iPad are the harbingers of the future. But at the same time it&#x27;s just as obvious that the iPad does not represent anywhere near the final evolution along those lines. It&#x27;s clear to me that consumer OSes will increasingly be like modern mobile OSes, with managed apps, streamlined UI, and even more streamlined administration. But the idea of there being such a gulf between a desktop with a keyboard and mouse on the one hand and a touch-only tablet on the other is mostly an accident of history. As well, the idea, from Windows 8, that there should be a single UI model that spans both portable (touch only) and stationary (keyboard and mouse) realms is ridiculous.<p>There should be a lot more innovation, a lot more development, and a lot more trial and error out in the market today. But until the market dynamics change we&#x27;ll likely be stuck with a lot of lazy designs for a while.",1382653531

6608321,comment,6606899,6606899,5,0,bstpierre,,,"IMO the aliases for git should be in ~/.gitconfig instead. I have a bunch of these, like:<p><pre><code>    [alias]
    br = branch
    co = checkout
    ci = commit -v
    sci = svn dcommit --interactive
    cp = cherry-pick
    l = log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
    l3 = log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit -n3
    lm = log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit master..
    rc = rebase --continue
    st = status -sb
    squash = !git rebase -i --autosquash $(git merge-base master HEAD)
</code></pre>
Also, I prefer to set aliases in my ~/.functions instead of in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc. I find that this makes it easier to move the .functions file from one machine to another, especially on a lab/test machine with a shared account where I shouldn&#x27;t be modifying things in the shared ~/.bashrc. To make this work, you can add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:<p><pre><code>    if [ -f ~/.functions ]; then . ~/.functions; fi
</code></pre>
This will source your .functions file if it exists when your .bashrc is run.<p>A tweak to the &quot;editbash&quot; suggested alias will make it so that you don&#x27;t have to reopen your terminal. My equivalent alias is &quot;vif&quot;, for &quot;vi .functions&quot;:<p><pre><code>    alias vif=&#x27;vi ~/.functions; . ~/.functions&#x27;
</code></pre>
Note that the second command (after the semicolon) sources the modified .functions file.<p>Lastly: brevity is king. I love &#x27;alias psgrep=&quot;ps aux | grep&quot;&#x27;, since I use it several times a day, but to &quot;level up your shell game&quot;, keep it short. My alias for this command is &quot;psg&quot;. The other alias that I use all the time is &quot;d&quot; -- &quot;alias d=&#x27;ls -lFh --color --group-directories -v&#x27;&quot;.",1382652162

One could say that the it switched from being about &quot;the year of the linux desktop&quot; to &quot;the year of the linux palmtop&quot;, and that already happened.<p>Of course, depending on your point of view, that may just be double speak to obscure original point, which to varying degrees it most certainly is.",1382652046
6608309,comment,6606920,6607618,4,0,acqq,,,"One possible explanation is that the compiler and linker don&#x27;t produce 100.00%  same output because they have somewhere uninitialized space which gets written to the disk. That&#x27;s why disassembly can still match 100.00%: the bytes that differ don&#x27;t contribute to any observable functionality. If you know C, you can imagine how it happens:<p>You have somewhere char buff[ 32 ] which you don&#x27;t set all to zeros, then you do strcpy( buff, &quot;something&quot; ) then you write all 32 bytes of buff to the file. What&#x27;s behind &quot;something&quot;? It can be different in every run.<p>Now look at the picture: <a href=""https://madiba.encs.concordia.ca/~x_decarn/truecrypt-binaries-analysis/img/tcsys64-un_hex.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://madiba.encs.concordia.ca/~x_decarn/truecrypt-binarie...</a><p>See the &quot;RSDS&quot;? It&#x27;s some initial value, just like c:\truec... that follows some bytes later. And what&#x27;s behind? Some small sequence of random bytes. I&#x27;ve just checked and confirmed that it appears in the &quot;.rdata&quot; (read only data) section of the executable.<p>Now the fact that this doesn&#x27;t happen on much more places also means that somebody in Microsoft obviously from time to time does fully clean the code, that is, somebody worries about such effects too, but it seems that from time to time some &quot;late&quot; fix then slips through, misbehaving.<p>Another explanation would be that there is something in the building code or script that produces some different values in the initialization area. That can be then observed by source inspection.<p>The third explanation would be some kind of &quot;unique id&quot; generated by the compiler or linker. Then this effect should be observed in all binaries even when the source is fully different (e.g. compile some program which generates Vogon poetry, observe the same effect). This hypothesis doesn&#x27;t match the observations, according to the pictures presented.<p>So I believe the highest possibility is the first assumption being true.",1382652036

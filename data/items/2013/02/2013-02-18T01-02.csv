I remember be really pressed hard to invest in some natural gas wells where each well was ""owned"" by the investors who were paid out fractionally based on the production, the more wells you were in to the more you got paid. Someone I know was getting $3000 - $5000 checks a month from this operation and I was quite curious. But given the scope of things and the kinds of returns they were promising I was amazed that such a deal would even be around by the time people got to me. So I asked for a picture of the gas works. Which was provided but didn't match where they said it was (go go Google Earth!) and once I tracked down where they said things were going on, it was near the edge of the live fire missile range which a) meant you couldn't go out there to take pictures, and b) the US Bureau of Land Management wasn't about to be writing gas leases on land you might get bombed on. Sure enough, a call into the local sheriff left no doubt. No wells, no drilling, anywhere. And he got another data point for his investigation (I wasn't the first person who called). About 9 months later the whole thing vanished. I mean literally everyone in charge just disappeared. Sad really.",1361152519

Sure, there are people who would prefer 20 hours and half (or less) salary, but they're in the vast minority, so that's not what companies build their workforces around.<p>This is probably mostly true, but I think there are more factors at highly competitive places (which a lot of us hackers are at).<p>I take a look at any of the top firms in law, finance, medicine, etc - where even entry-level staff pull 60+ hours a week.<p>From talking with various friends in these fields, no one actually wants to work such hours.. a lot would even take pay reductions if they could work less.

5237669,comment,5233138,5237507,2,0,genwin,,,"> Because spacetime is curved, and the curvature limits the size of a local inertial frame straddling the horizon.<p>True but irrelevant. The thought experiment needs only an arbitrarily small time interval as measured in X to make its case, so the size of X doesn't matter. That said, X can be arbitrarily large in principle, even light years across, just make the black hole as massive as needed. When X is light years across the escaping particles needn't exit X for years, yet the thought experiment is concluded in as little as a nanosecond.<p>> Because the particles that are escaping have to be moving to the right at very, very close to the speed of light, whereas the particles that are not escaping are not. This is not a contradiction.<p>The particles below the horizon can have a <i>higher</i> velocity in the outward direction than the escaping particles do. The velocities of the particles below the horizon is not specified in the diagram, and there's no limit to how close any of the particles' velocities can be to c, as measured in X. When all the particles above the horizon are escaping and all the particles below the horizon are let to have a velocity closer to c in the outward direction than the escaping particles have, GR still demands that the cloud splits, unlike what would be predicted for an inertial frame with the same velocities for particles specified. In an inertial frame under those conditions the particles with higher velocities would be moving closer to the other particles, not getting further away from them. There is a contradiction.<p>> Another way to see what's going on is to ask what a line of constant radius r looks like in Frame X.<p>I understand your example here. Nevertheless the cloud splits under conditions where it wouldn't split in an inertial frame in special relativity, in contradiction with the principle of equivalence. Unless that can be disproved it seems the blog raises a valid issue with GR.<p>> I haven't done any such thing.<p>You said ""you won't be pointing to the singularity in the center of the black hole there"". When you say that singularities have a location in time only you can't then refer to their location in space without contradicting yourself. The ""in the center of the black hole there"" references a place in space. You'd have to instead be careful to say something like ""you won't be pointing to the singularity that <i>you say</i> is in the center of the black hole there"".<p>> You say you have taken classes on this material; have you raised the issues you are raising here in class?<p>I first saw this blog yesterday.",1361152170

'synchronized' has no bearing here. If the request processing is purely CPU-bound with no async operations then only one request will be processed at any time, otherwise Node will happily process up to thousands of requests simultaneously. This is the ideal use case for Node. It should be trivial to log the amount of simultaneous requests being processed.<p>According to Heroku docs, Cedar routers do not do any queuing and just serve requests immediately to any random dyno. They are pretty clear on this in multiple places, specifically talking about concurrent requests in Node. They also mention a 'routing mesh', which suggests there are many routers doing their thing.

In addition, of course, there are other alternate Lua implementations which have their own set of tradeoffs.<p>Essentially, it's very nice to be able to switch Lua implementations depending on the circumstance.  With normal usage, LuaJIT is carefully designed to make this possible (indeed, easy: one need only change the library one links against, it's not even necessary to recompile one's app), but once you start using things like FFI, that ability is lost.<p>There's a port of LuaJIT's FFI interface to standard Lua, but it's also not portable, and because it will have very different performance characteristics than FFI in LuaJIT (which can ""compile out"" FFI accesses), it's not really a drop-in replacement for it, and I think not nearly as compelling.<p> The one that's bitten me in the past is that LuaJIT has a much smaller limit on addressable memory than standard Lua because of the particular design of its nan-encoded object representation.  There are some input files for my Lua-using app that will only work when I compile with standard Lua, because using LuaJIT will run out of memory; those are times when I'm very glad I didn't commit to a LuaJIT-only design...",1361151418

There was a dump which <i>may</i> have violated lock-up terms, fair disclosure, or insider trading rules. But I don't see a pump, just a reverse merger and liquidation by an investor. The classic pump and dump involves acquiring a position in an illiquid stock, spreading false information to get investors to bid up its price, selling out of the position at a profit, and leaving the market to figure out it overvalued the stock.<p>Also, you will not go to jail. You can be incredibly stupid, down to hiring a chimpanzee chairman who moonlights as a special advisor to the board to take your company public via a reverse merger (he read about it on StockTwits) who liquidates his investment on the day the lock-up ends, thereby hosing every other stockholder, and still be well within the law, which punishes fraud, not navet.<p>><i>Here were a few reasons why it didn't get covered: ...b) Too difficult to prove</i><p>The threshold for the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, et al to report purported fraud isn't astronomical.

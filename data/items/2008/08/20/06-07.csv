281269,comment,281111,281177,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"If potential startup succes is judged substantially by the quality of teams, and this is very much dependent on the quality of a team's interaction, empathy and collective intelligence, then having automated recommendations on potential cofounders would be valuable. Even YouNoodle could use its startup data to recommend people on the site it predicts would lead to a quality team and hence a probable quality startup.",1219215382

Full instructions at: <a href=""http://amazingstuffs.blogspot.com/2007/10/download-data-structures-video.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amazingstuffs.blogspot.com/2007/10/download-data-stru...</a>, but it doesn't bode well if you can't figure it out for yourself<p>* The math gets significantly less heavy after the first few lectures.  If you get lost, plow ahead and revisit the first few lectures after you've gotten further.<p>* Erik Demaine rocks.  He went straight to the top of my list of ""computer scientists I'd like to have a beer with sometime...""<p>*  I found the discussions of Red-Black Trees and the graph theory ""trilogy"" to be especially enjoyable, but that could just be me.",1219214918

What would you give as your credence that the coin came up tails then?",1219214844

It's not like I'm making up the fact that software startups have non-negotiable IP clauses.<p>You want a really fun non-negotiable clause? Come up with something ""patentable"", then quit. You can be forced to work on the patent application, a year later, at a rate set by your ex-employer. Happened to me.",1219214213

281255,comment,280601,280601,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I find the author's assumptions that every idea stems from one individual and must be (ineffectively) communicated to everyone else to be rather strange. I'm all about small teams, and I personally prefer to work alone, but to ignore the contributions that are offered by other members of the team is folly. The ""corruption [of ideas] at multiple points"" that he mentions could just as easily be interpreted as improvements on the idea.",1219213794

281252,comment,281046,281182,0,0,BrandonM,,,"It looked like xrange to me. Honestly, though, I can see why it's not in SBCL, because I don't actually find myself using xrange all that much. It's mostly stuff like:<p><pre><code>  for unused in xrange(500):\n    # perform some operation (500 times)\n</code></pre>\nIn Lisp, this is just:<p><pre><code>  (dotimes (unused 500) ; perform some operation... )</code></pre>",1219213254

Just look at all the really creative development stuff that's come out in the last coule of decades....<p>Linux....  16 year old Finnish kid with nothing to do during those long cold finnish winters.<p>MySql....  bunch of swedes with the same problem.<p>PHP... a few hackers with credentials I'm not familiar with but I don't think they came from academia....<p>Ruby...  Japanese kid obsessed with unix and C.<p>Rails... Danish kid going to a business school in denmark and hacking on the side......<p>True, the code that runs the internet was written by a bunch of UC Berkley grad students but that was back in the days when you had to be tied to some kind of entity like that in order to have access to the hardware that was needed to run your code.  Since the mid 90s this hardware has been very cheap and available to anyone with the passion to purchase and develop.<p>Many have and they have left traditional venues for new and creative functionality in the dust.",1219212532

(Since I don't charge for upgrades, literally the only use I have for it is reproducing bugs.  You won't find one written on my website anywhere.)<p>Back in the ""all software users are software enthusiasts"" days, all that stuff you learned about ""point upgrades"" and ""beta releases"" and whatnot actually made sense to people.  Your mother does not care about the difference between a .1 and .01 point release, and <i>never will</i>.  Make sure your website distributes the newest and best version, and make upgrading between not-the-newest-and-best-version and the-newest-and-best-version as automatic and painless as possible, to the limit of your business model's ability to do so.<p>Adjust as required if your product has to be compatible with other things.  (Not ordinarily a worry of mine in B2C land.)<p>(I really envy you web-only guys some days.

657842,comment,657663,657663,0,0,davidalln,,,"> Now they need a kind of apprenticeship: real tasks to work on, the freedom to experiment and to risk failure, but in an environment that models respect for commitment.<p>As someone who just got out of an AP Computer Science class, I could not agree with this statement more despite the fact that it was written over 15 years ago. While I had an excellent teacher and really enjoyed the class, I found that in the textbook and on the test that we were simply required to demonstrate that we knew the basic components of the Java API, not necessarily how to implement them. Even on the free response questions, the test writers held our hands through unrealistic problems that tested whether or not we knew what a HashMap was and if we knew how to iterate through it.<p>The GridWorld case study doesn't help either. In their failed attempt the create a more ""real world"" problem, they created more questions that could be answered on the ability to memorize what classes in the program do what and not on how well you understand programming concepts.<p>Sure, it makes sense for Google to ""test"" their job applicants with a programming problem, but I honestly doubt they ask ""The following program will throw a (blank) exception"".<p>Perhaps The College Board should structure their curriculum similar to their Studio Art curriculum, where students send in pieces of their portfolio to be judged and ""graded"". Students should be given a real world application to create or a difficult puzzle to solve that must be turned in at a certain date to be given a grade. Obviously there would be a bit more involved thinking in that process, but I really think that would provide a much more meaningful experience.<p>Any person can memorize a bunch of rules from an API, but a real ""5"" student can actually apply those rules and manipulate them to solve any problem thrown at him.",1245032748

You probably wouldn't tell your dad that stuff only because he likely wouldn't understand, but it would be at the front of your mind.<p>We're obsessed with the performance metric, big bets per hour for live players, big bets per 100 hands (BB/100) for online. Standard deviations, results ranges, levels of certainty. You obsess about that stuff or you end up broke. (Of course, you may do both.)<p>In fact if you read online poker forums, hands and win rates are rarely ever discussed with dollar values because they aren't very relevant. They're almost always given in terms of big bets, and most if not all online hand converters (which take a hand history from a poker site and print it out in an easy to read format for posting on forums) convert to that automatically.<p>The absolute dollar amounts are only useful for getting a very rough estimate of the level of competition given no other information.",1245032667

They are not metrics. Taking the story from the post, if my ""friends and family"" were asking me about the ""success"" of a poker bot, I'd still point to net profit as the best metric with which to define success (unless you're doing it for CS/math reasons).<p>It's a bit like if I'm a professional, <i>regular</i> poker player and family members ask me how I'm doing.

657825,comment,657262,657444,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Anyway, this seems an uncharacteristically juvenile HBR article. Of course businesses are not 100% efficient, they are run by humans after all. But firms which are more efficient then others have lower operating costs, better R&D, higher margins, more innovation, etc. - these are the competitive advantage that 'efficient' firms use to get the edge on competitors. That's not to say that each one doesn't do something to make you as an investor go crazy.<p>Cut him some slack, from his bio he looks like a pure academic who hasn't done business.

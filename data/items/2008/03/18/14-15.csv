139853,comment,139741,139795,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>I haven't been following the HTML5 effort</i><p>Neither has anyone. The HTML standard has been dormant for seven or eight years. That's nearly a lifetime ago. (Literally -- at Drupalcon we had a lecture on jQuery from a twelve-year-old.) The web standards folks are like the anti-DHH: Their development cycle is ""release late and infrequently"". We all fell asleep a long time ago, waiting for these guys to actually <i>release something we can use</i>.<p>Admittedly, the endless delay is not the standardistas' fault. The elephant in the room is that you can't really make progress in Web standards by refining the standards: They're not the bottleneck. The bottleneck is getting MS to conform to the standard, and you could interpret the last eight years as a long struggle to construct a critical mass of standards-compliant browsers and pages, such that MS has no choice but to take notice. It's been an epic battle, akin to Stallman's effort to construct a free operating system from scratch, so it took a while. But the battle seems to be getting won, thank god.<p>And I'm happy to read the occasional cheerful article, like this one, which assures me that the future is looking good, and that everyone is finally ready to join hands and sing. But then I have to go back to work, every day, and remind myself of how broken the standards are as I struggle to port designs to IE. The optimism wears off quickly. This damned broken browser apparently has an 80% market share, so I have no choice. It's like trying to change tires with your teeth, I have to do it <i>every single week</i>, and it makes me <i>royally pissed</i>.<p>And that's why I like Joel's article. No, he doesn't see things from the perspective of an optimistic member of the HTML5 team. He sees things from <i>my</i> perspective, from the outside, where the situation <i>sucks</i> and <i>has sucked for nearly a decade</i> and where an honest extrapolation predicts <i>further suckage</i> despite all the sunny promises. I'm not going to credit Microsoft and the HTML5 team with a solution to this problem until the solution has shipped and has significant marketshare, because I'm in pain, and help has been on the way for a very, very long time.",1205852072

Users want shiny new native applications for their iPhones, and they will get them with the SDK""<p>While people certainly wouldn't know or care about technical details, they will certainly know and care when they see a very large class of neat applications that are simply impossible for the iPhone right now.<p>I really despise the closed, control-freak nature of apple, which is exemplified by the iPhone. None of these limitations are technical in nature, but are purely business decisions made so that Apple remains as much in control as possible.<p>Everyone remember how last year's line was ""the web is the only SDK you need""? They had to be dragged kicking and screaming into providing this SDK, and they'll be dragged into opening it up as well.",1205851891

That's a good reason to have bipedal robots.<p>But on the other hand, if you get close, but not exactly with bipedal robots, people might get even more freaked out with the uncanny valley.",1205851791

Thank you all.<p>Secondly and maybe more importantly are the effects of the logo change on the site. Originally I had no logo on the web app, wanting to restrict the app to the bare essentials and ideally no images at all, also limiting the features / text concentrating on just one core concept. (This is a sort of design challenge I wanted to experiment with.)<p>Eventually I relented and added a few images inc a logo which was really cheap looking. After lots of complaints, we put a day into creating a new logo, then put up some roughs here for critique, then took on board much of the advice and added the new logo.<p>The app is scaling quite fast and enjoys decent organic traffic, however a high percentage would bounce straight off, looking at only the landing page. Since the new logo, the stats are very interesting, there is not one hit where they just look at one page and leave, all traffic now spending considerable more time on the site.<p>I guess this will appear to obvious to some but still it has surprised me and been an interesting eye opener as to the effects of eye candy.<p>New logo: http://www.myplaylist.biz<p>No more critiques pls.

An ebook launch like this will get the job done.<p>However, if you write a book that will blow people's minds and change a culture or an industry forever, you don't need the big launch. The name of your book will be whispered into the ears of others for a long time.

4478663,comment,4478498,4478498,0,0,antihero,,,"One thing I'd like to add/contradict. For system-wide Python packages, avoid pip, use your system package manager, else you will eventually end up with conflicts when something you install requires the library you have pip installed, and your package manager wants to install it. Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper with your system package manager! Then use virtualenv for any actual projects you are working on. If your repository version of virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper is outdated, use better repos/PPAs/AUR.<p>Basically, you should never ever find yourself typing <i>sudo pip</i>. If you refuse to use a virtualenv for some reason, use <i>pip --user</i>.<p>The other benefit of this approach is that your system package manager will keep your system packages up to date and the required versions for any software on your system.<p>Honestly, I think the best solution in the long term would be for pip, by default, to install to a user environment (installing in ~/.local using the --user flag) if it is run unprivileged and not in a virtualenv.",1346839022

A few days back i pulled all of my email to Thunderbird only to discover a few differences between g vs hot mail.<p>No pop account in hotmail, effectively every read message still appears unread in the online email client.
By default hotmail had an option checked to ""leaving only 14 days of email online"". All the rest was virtually deleted and therefore existed only on my computer.
There was an insane plugin to submit those all back to inbox without disturbing dates or subjects.
However, that only resulted in hotmail access being revoked after 150 or so emails since there is some sort of cap on pushing emails at once to your account.
The gmail contacts and email search resembles that of google as a search engine. No other comes near.<p>Still there is a lot of opportunity to improve this. PG wrote a list of top ten products in which search was first and email was second. Sparrow might have been a good effort. Let's see when it evolves further.",1346838943

I <i>literally</i> count as food insecure unless I attempt to defeat that conclusion by lying to the survey.  You don't have to worry too much about me, and if you knew my situation when I was a kid (and squarely within the <i>intention</i> of the definition, in those days), you could be excused for not worrying all that much.<p>I'm about to say something which is indelicate, but probably true.<p>Poor Somalis look like poor Chinese look like poor Brazilians look like poor peasants from the Middle Ages, because human physiology reacts to starvation in predictable ways.  Poor Americans do not resemble any of the above, because to the extent they have a problem with food, it is that they consume far too much of it.  You can measure the nutritional consumption of poor Americans.  We have.  It is statistically virtually indistinguishable from that of rich Americans.  Poor American kids?  Same story.<p>(Some people might phrase poor folks' food problems as ""too much of the wrong food"", but I think this conflates the problem with a moral judgment about food-as-values-signaling.  One of the reasons we stigmatize e.g. Coke over e.g. fresh squeezed orange juice is <i>precisely because</i> poor people drink Coke and rich people drink fresh squeezed orange juice.  Both would be better off with switching more of their beverage consumption to tap water.)<p>See generally :<p><a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1990/09/how-poor-are-americas-poor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1990/09/how-poor-ar...</a><p>or you can make anecdotal observations by going to any high-poverty region of America and, well, looking.",1346838648

But you'd also have to calculate the costs of shipping excess grain to the comparison of global grain prices, because it's a tad bit expensive to ship tons of grain around the world.<p>And then you'd also have to calculate the effects of a smaller market on the produce sellers of the world. I'm sure that farmers who export food to the US do so because the prices they get are better; otherwise, they'd be selling it locally. So, if they sold less to America, they wouldn't be making as much money, which wouldn't be feeding into their local economies. And that will hurt people as well.<p>It isn't as simple of a problem as what you're trying to make it. True, Americans - in general - should probably eat less. But the reason isn't to help global food prices. But, if you're talking about trying to feed under-nourished Americans,  that's a different argument.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to help lower global food prices, the first step would be to stop turning corn into ethanol fuel (ethanol for human consumption is fine).

This post annoyed me b/c I was just about to post about the advantages I see starting and running a business here :)<p>The author misses quite a few of the main things that I find great about being in Scotland, although I do agree with the general thrust.<p>Some thoughts about Scotland compared with the USA, having previously started and ran 3 companies there:<p>- wages are very cheap here compared to the USA or even the South (England), and the talent is good.<p>- It's easy to market to and service the USA (no huge timezone difference or language barrier and Americans like the Scottish accent).<p>- there are already some incredible tax advantages (low capital gains) for startups, and more being pushed by the current government.<p>- most funding seems to be done by angel syndicates in a public / private hybrid where both the gov and the angels share risk and reward.  I much prefer the syndicate model to individuals as you get more structure and less hassle.<p>- you don't need health insurance for employees, which removes a distraction and makes your job offer compete on a more level playing field when compared against a traditional large company<p>- the tech community like the author pointed out is really good, particularly for the size<p>- the quality of life here is AMAZING.  Can't fully describe the benefits in a comment.<p>- office space is currently very cheap<p>- great public transport<p>- easy to travel (for business and pleasure) to either EU or USA",1346836579

What we can be sure of is that there's no way to summarise the CSS standards compliance of a browser or to indicate concisely the browser level requirements of a website for a human. This I fear makes designing for the web a case of breaking down and designing for lots of individual UA that meet a list of hundreds of different point versions for different abilities instead of being able to simply design to a standard HTML5+CSS3 and readily see that the top X browsers will support (with some issues of course) the elements of those standards.<p>Instead of one current standard there are now hundreds of standards?!",1346836483

However casinos will kick you out (or most likely politely ask if you might want to play something else) if they believe you're counting cards effectively (they have no problem with people who count cards badly).  But this has no basis in law and isn't an accusation of cheating.

I don't yet know if there's a science of counter-machine-learning -- that is, creating examples that are hard for models to classify, analogously to making harder and harder CAPTCHAs. If government gets better at data science, what civil libertarians will need is not better encriptions, but different techniques designed to protect against <i>statistical</i> intrusions.<p>Likewise, I don't think better crypto is in any straightforward way a protection against biometrics or government bills to take down certain websites.<p>If he's saying ""we need more libertarians and people concerned about civil liberties,"" then he's right.  But I'm not even sure there are fewer than there used to be (look at the backlash to SOPA).  I just suspect think there was a time when people had more hope in purely technological fixes to government abuses.  I know some old-time crypto-anarchists, and they're largely disappointed with how things have turned out.  In the end, preventing the abuse of government power is a hard problem, and it looks less likely that a small set of tech breakthroughs will suddenly make civil liberties violations obsolete.",1335139104

3876590,comment,3875816,3876191,3,0,monopede,,,"You can build a library for doing Erlang-style programming, but there are lots of features that you can't reproduce.<p>(1) In C++ you may get hard crashes, so to get reliability you need to use high-overhead OS processes.  Erlang allows you to hundreds of thousands (yes, really) of processes because they are really lightweight (76 words + heap/stack).\nAlso, copying within the same address space has much lower overhead (no system call/context switch) and serialisation is much simpler.<p>(2) Because of immutable data you can do have nice fault tolerance as follows.  Imagine you have a request handler function that takes a state and a request.  However, the request is malformed or triggers a bug in the handler.  In a  language that doesn't enforce immutability you have to restart the handler process because the state may be in an inconsistent form.  In Erlang you would just discard the request (or send an error message) and handle the next request with the unmodified state.<p>(3) Pattern matching makes receiving a message very convenient.<p>I probably forgot a few things, but this gives you an idea.",1335138741

Remember to account for the time and materials making up fixtures.<p>I would price the labor at around $15-$30 per hour minimum. You aren't going to farm this out to an assembly shop (not enough volume) and there isn't enough money in it to hire employees and deal with that overhead, so you're down to finding a FOAF or a student who can solder and is reliable. Factor into that that the person must be supervised.<p>Next, this isn't just assembly that has to work; it has to look good, so the assembler needs the skill and attention to detail to provide that. That means either you get lucky or you have a lot of rework, or you watch him closely. Soldering is not enough: need to pay attention to the cut ends of those thick conductors. The component lead terminations must look good and the components themselves should be fairly regularly placed and not look sloppy. Remember, you're selling primarily on looks. Also, if this assembler isn't always available, you have to make enough inventory to handle orders that may come in until he can make more if you don't have the time to do it yourself.<p>Volumes are uncertain, but the parts are cheap, so let's assume he buys enough to make 100 units at a time. The selling price has to reflect the risk that all those parts won't be used. Buy higher inventory levels and your parts cost goes down, but risk of ""dead stock"" goes up.<p>Having a small electronics mfg business on the side, I live this on a daily basis. Luckily I don't sell to price sensitive hobbyists :-)<p>But in the end, the price I'd try to sell it for has nothing to do with how much it cost to build: it's cool looking.

I could go on about the various advantages this model provides, but as other posters have so eruditely pointed out, MPI provides the same abstract framework for dealing with the problems that actors are intended to solve.<p>I'm not a professional erlang developer, but I've based and written a new NoSQL database thats intended to store billions of records in Erlang, altogether clocking in at less than 1000 lines of code, and after this experience, I can safely say that I will never try to build distributed apps, save some niche cases, in another language (even Haskell).<p>Here's what stands out about Erlang to me, in contract to comparable options.<p>Firstly, HiPE and BEAM may be the most advanced virtual machine systems in the world. People working with JVM will claim this an exaggeration, but in terms of reliability and speed, my experience with HiPE is unmatched.<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, OTP.<p>Open Telephony Platform is the single best collected library for dealing with various problems that I have ever seen. The Generics (gen_server, gen_fsm, etc.) are a quick, fast and easy solution to problems and edge cases that would bog down even the best MPI developer. For example, dealing with internal state as a finite state machine is not new, but it's not nearly as popular as it should be, perhaps to this end it's apt to say that Erlang does for parallelism and distribution what Ruby on Rails did for web development -- It forces you to make intelligent decisions.<p>The systems responsible for controlling emergency services, global telecom infrastructure, many large MMOs, and countless other applications <i>are</i> Erlang. If you trust 911, you can trust Erlang.<p>I could go on, Hot code loading while old processes still depend on usable code? Built in failover? Function takeover? Automatic workload offloading?

Thank you.<p><i>In a later post, you mentioned mapping teeth with a toothbrush. That's not a trivial thing to do - without a fixed frame of reference it would not only be very complex mathematically, but also pretty unreliable.</i><p>Of course. That is why I'd incorporate a frame of reference into the design of the toothbrush. The point of the post was to quickly paint a picture of what ""the future"" could be like if I were given time and freedom to pursue these designs. I assumed that if anyone was interested in the details, then they'd simply ask me to provide them.<p>The toothbrush contains two technologies that enable it to build a map of the surfaces of the teeth you brush. #1: a three-axis gyroscope + accelerometer (e.g. same as an iPhone's). This gets me the rotation of the toothbrush relative to the direction of gravity. Now, of course, this would not be enough by itself; we also need some way of determining the position of the bristles within the mouth. This is accomplished with sensor #2: along the length of the toothbrush near the mouthpiece, there are dozens of tiny light sensors. The more the toothbrush is inserted into the mouth, the less light that reaches the light sensors. This gets you a reading of ""how deeply is the toothbrush into the mouth?"" which you can easily combine with ""what are the current angles of rotation?"" to conclude e.g. ""the bristles are therefore currently brushing the front surface of your bottom-left-rearmost molar.""<p>Light sensors are easy to work with, but probably not the most reliable way of doing this. I would look into using some kind of sonar sensor, possibly. Or you could do something as simple as ""detect which part of the toothbrush that your lips are currently touching""; that might work too.<p>The goal is straightforward: ""to determine an accurate-enough approximation of how deeply the toothbrush is currently inserted into the mouth"", because that can be combined with the rotation angles to give you a solid frame of reference.<p>I of course don't know which technique will prove to be the most pragmatic, since I haven't tested any them yet. =) This <i>is</i> a solvable problem, however.<p>I've got to run for now, so unfortunately I ran out of time to address your other [excellent] points.

Let's say, ""Don't throw the baby out with the bath water.""<p>I suspect it is a response to a future decision the author intuits large groups of computer laborers may make: that computers, in general, establish a unique, more intensely stressful baseline type for burnout cases. Usually the standard response (or rather ""therapy"") to burnout, even in the professional, occupational setting, in engineering and technical jobs involves doing something unrelated to that type of work. It is Feynman's point made official through the history of its adoption in business and corporate settings. But _physics_ isn't tossed out; a particular _institution of physics studies_ is tabled. This point is going to be made for _computer systems_ as well; perhaps the author is now asserting it. Web building will soon become a respectable science, wherein its general idiom becomes abstracta that support true, albeit horrifyingly misleading, statements like ""My Internet does not work"" or ""I read ten articles on the Internet today"" which people use in everyday conversation.<p>As Wittgenstein would say,<p>""I launched the ball!""\n""He recoiled at the thought.""\n""She exploded with joy.""\n""The Sun gave me a sun burn.""\n""My grandmother is a dinosaur.""\n""Astrology is not a true science.""\n""She turned at a right angle.""<p>Is there anything essential as a response to burnout that involves stepping away from the computer system? What does it truly mean for us if ""Internet"" becomes a household name? How are people thinking about it? What are their statements about it? Why does most advice seem to suggest ""stand up and go smell a flower, seek pleasure"". Is the Web not pleasuable? Seeking _it_? Working on _it_? -- It seems clear to me that the author is making a very simple point: whence come hedonism of the craft? -- To me, it sounds like: ""step out of the machine!"" I believe this is what motivates the couched ""freedom of will"" discussion (burnout is a ""wall""). Intuitions about Robert Nozick's Experience Machine are what are stake here.<p>Let's assume that ""go outside and smell a rose"" is the description of a machine. Our author, I suggest, argues that ""write code for pleasurable project"" is another description for a machine. What is assumed is that one can choose, regardless of practicality (that your project may be even less successful because of your choosing is irrelevant here, being compelled to make the decision does not necessitate that one should make it). What is at stake here, again, are intuitions about the machine, and namely what it affords at all. Choosing to take an experience of another sort involves concepts of continuity, roughly, I believe, Nozick's discovered intuitions of we have:<p>1. (Here I can only hope my analogy fits, but I believe it motivates, essentially, any apologetic position toward burnout:) ""we first want to do actions"" which gives any consequent desire for the experiences of those actions. In development and engineer jobs, technical jobs in general, we call this ""burnout""; experiences (stress) eventually overwhelms desire to work (want to perform those actions). The storehouse of experience (one's work history) becomes nothing more than the description of some machine (a set of experiences one has had). So, there is an imperative to reject that machine. My follow-up is: Why does this response to burnout logically resemble Nozick's discovered intuition/response of: ""Do not enter the machine""? -- ""Step out of the usual.""\n2. (Again:) Whether it is choosing to code a fun side-project or going out to build a doghouse, we are enjoying our freedom. What's not important here are practical considerations, the limits of one's autonomy cannot be defined only in terms what one perceives as one's own limits; one's autonomy is not established through the capacity of one's epistemtic assessment. Going with the flow because the current is strong only establishes the acceptance of a machine-like existence. So ""go fly a kite"" to assert one's freedom.\n3. (Again:) One's reality is limited to workflows and projects. ""Leave the machine.""<p>My general point here is that the structure of the argument: ""go do something different,"" to me, looks very similar to our intuitions as to why one would reject the machine.",1335136862

8639190,comment,8639038,8639128,0,0,mikeyouse,,,"I like the historical usage of <i>Chutzpah</i>, but it&#x27;s become less of an insult of late:<p><pre><code>    Leo Rosten in The Joys of Yiddish defines chutzpah as &quot;gall, 
    brazen nerve, effrontery, incredible &#x27;guts&#x27;, presumption plus
    arrogance such as no other word and no other language can do 
    justice to&quot;. In this sense, chutzpah expresses both strong 
    disapproval and condemnation.
</code></pre>
He Goes on:<p><pre><code>    In the same work, Rosten also defined the term as &quot;that quality
    enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, 
    throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an 
    orphan&quot;.   Chutzpah amounts to a total denial of personal
    responsibility, that renders others speechless and incredulous... 
    one cannot quite believe that another person totally lacks common
    human traits like remorse, regret, guilt, sympathy and insight.
    The implication is at least some degree of psychopathy in the 
    subject, as well as the awestruck amazement of the observer at 
    the display.

On OS X, I regularly use vim, TextMate, and BBEdit.<p>I find that TextMate looks the best. I simply enjoy typing code into TextMate more than I do in vim or BBEdit. Thus, when I&#x27;m doing a stretch of writing new code, or straightforward modification of existing code, I&#x27;ll probably do it in TextMate (although some days it just feels like it is a vim day or a BBEdit day).<p>If I need to make a lot of related changes, I&#x27;ll switch to vim, and use regular expressions or I&#x27;ll record a macro to repeatedly apply.<p>If I&#x27;m doing something like making some modification at all places that use a particular database table, I&#x27;ll probably go to BBEdit. I can do a search for that table and click &quot;find all&quot;, and it gives a separate window showing all the matches, with an editing section in the bottom part that shows whichever search result I click. This lets me easily see all the places where the table is referenced, and easily edit them, and go back and forth as needed. It works similarly with the results of a multi-file search, which makes it nice when I&#x27;m trying to understand crusty old legacy code.<p>If I start a work session in TextMate, and switch to vim to do something with macros, I&#x27;ll probably stay there and continue editing. When I exit the editor to test the code, then I&#x27;ll probably head back to TextMate. Same if I go to BBEdit for something--I&#x27;ll stay there until I need something that is better in vim.<p>I realize I&#x27;m not making full use of the capabilities of one or more of these editors. BBEdit can certainly do most of the things vim can do, and all of the things I use vim for, for instance, but I&#x27;m fine with simply popping into vim for those things.",1416530955

However, it remains downloadable by specifying its exact version, which is what allows the Restore workflow to continue working.<p>If you run into an exceptional situation where you think one of your packages must be deleted, this can be handled manually by the NuGet team. e.g. if there is a copyright infringement issue, or potentially harmful content, that could be a valid reason to delete it.&quot;<p>(Source: <a href=""http://docs.nuget.org/docs/Creating-Packages/Creating-and-Publishing-a-Package#Deleting_packages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.nuget.org/docs/Creating-Packages/Creating-and-Pu...</a>)",1416530486

Sure, we&#x27;re using a slightly different meaning of balance I suspect. In the case of Smash Brothers, and World of Warcraft, the &#x27;actors&#x27; each have different capabilities, some are offensive, some are defensive. In both of these cases the abilities can be &quot;enhanced&quot; by in game power ups.<p>Thus if you are playing actor &#x27;A&#x27;, and I am playing actor &#x27;B&#x27;, we state the game &#x27;balanced&#x27; if every offensive action that &#x27;A&#x27; has, has an equivalent defensive action on &#x27;B&#x27;s part, and vice versa. If an actor A has offensive capabilities that can overpower every other actors&#x27;s defensive capability, then that actor is referred to as being &#x27;over powered&#x27;.<p>What the original article discusses, and I certainly resonate with, is that there is a third balancing factor which is the environment and sometimes more subtle properties of an actor which are not specifically &#x27;offense&#x27; or &#x27;defense&#x27; related.<p>So to re contextualize that in terms of the argument you put forward, rock-paper-scissors is balanced at the actor level and the environment is irrelvant, so it plays the same way in all environments and is boring. If you add the environment, say underwater paper becomes mushy and can&#x27;t be cut by scissors, or in volcanic environments paper catches on fire and can&#x27;t wrap rocks, Etc, you create a more interesting game. One in which a strategy that works well in one environment, fails in another environment.<p>I realize that is a bit contrived, I was trying to stay with your use of r-p-s as the analogy which is imperfect to the task.<p>The short version is that widening the problem space from which you have to create a winning strategy makes it more interesting to me. That is done by spreading the notion of &#x27;balance&#x27; beyond just matching actor skills to include effects from the environment as well.",1416530269

It is named Pluronic ink, but they refer to it as &#x27;fugitive ink&#x27;.<p>This enables them to print a structure that incorporates this material, cool the whole thing down, and suck out the liquid.<p>They use this technique to lay down 3d channels in printed bio-materials, which they then infuse with endothelial cells to create blood vessels. Amazing!<p><i>The other ink dispensers would take their turn, laying down a lattice of collagen and fibroblasts that would solidify around the network of fugitive ink, encasing it in tan-colored living tissue. To drain the fugitive ink, Kolesky would place the tissue on a chilled stone cube; this would cause the ink to change from a gel to a liquid, after which he could then extract it with a small suction device. The end result would be a block of living tissue suffused with intricate vessels capable of carrying nutrients to the cells within.</i><p><i>The last step was to me the most remarkable. Once the vessels were empty, Kolesky would take a suspension of endothelial cells—the cells that line the insides of blood vessels—and inject it into the vessel network. The cells would settle in and multiply to line the insides of the channels, effectively turning the channels into blood vessels. And then the cells would spread—they would begin to branch off the existing vessels and form new ones. In effect, Lewis and her team have created an environment that the cells consider home—it is far more natural to them than a petri dish or the inorganic scaffolds that had previously played host to cultured tissues.</i>",1416530046

It&#x27;s not one&#x27;s perception of reality, it&#x27;s what is. Reality is also consistent, within it&#x27;s own rules.<p>We have ample evidence that cognition is created in the brain. We have ample evidence that our thoughts are the product of neuronal activity within our brains, and we are just really beginning to understand the mechanisms behind our quite amazing brain. There are many studies detailing experiments that have induced a wide range of feels in human brain using only physical means, including inducing the feeling of a spiritual experience.<p>We have ample evidence that chemicals, and brain structure affect that way we feel and what we like, love, hate and fear and that these are affect not just by our life&#x27;s experiences but the millions of years of our evolutionary heritage via genetics. Saying that science is useless in understanding human thought and motivation is much like saying that physics is completely worthless because it has not identified and categories every snowflake that has ever been. You don&#x27;t need the structure of of every snowflake to understand what conditions create them nor to predict when they may fall, and you don&#x27;t need to know everything about every thought to understand why people have thoughts and to understand the general principles behind their existence.<p>Why it&#x27;s true that our only window to reality is via our own consciousness and thus coloured by our own internal reality (which is not reality but our perception of it), we have found a system which can break through the fog of our minds and allow us to understand what reality(actual reality) is. This system is called science, and there has been no other system that even comes close to it&#x27;s effectiveness at determining the truth.<p>Coming back around to the topics you raised, &quot;love, justice, forgiveness, mercy, compassion, gratitude, contentment, etc&quot;, I will admit that science had has little to say about these concepts. That is because there is no one right answer for these things. They are non-deterministic, relative to the cultural and value system of the system the individual resides in and also the conditions in which such a culture exists. I will point out that the non-science based systems also fails us in regards to these topics, with little poking around one can find all sorts of different answers in regards to the above topics. Even looking at some other metric than consensus, non-science based methods to approach the above topics seem to do as much harm as good as the world is full of people who think they see the truth and insist that others see it the same way.<p>At least if we can understand why people feel the things they do, and the physical fundamentals behind them, we should be able to make more informed decisions and create more rational belief systems. Mysticism can not do this, science can. And perhaps one day will shed the vestiges of our collective evolutionary physiological heritage that served us well when we huddled in caves when danger and mystery did indeed surround everyday existence, but serve us much less in the modern. Surely one day it will be a positive step for us to look up at the starry night sky and not see outlines of mythological beings but the next stepping stone for humanity.",1416528792

I thought going into finance my salary would surpass ~200k after a few years, and as a developer, it would max out around that level. But, my salary now is about 100k (w/ 25k bonus) and I feel like I could be making way more as a developer right now...and I&#x27;m always thinking &quot;that could be me&quot; about my developer friends.<p>--Whatever I need to get done, I kludge away (usually in Python, R, or C/C++/C#) until it works; I have no concept of elegance in this context. Also, I&#x27;m usually the only one writing the programs--I&#x27;ve never worked in a collaborative development environment, since I mainly do research. I&#x27;m not sure how to get from this level to being a developer?<p>--I write programs to analyze data, which frequently involve machine learning/AI algorithms. Are companies looking for this in a web developer? Or should I try to tailor my skills more towards a data science position? Or is there a path you would recommend particularly for someone with this skill set?<p>--I want to stay in NYC<p>What I&#x27;m hoping to get out of asking this question on HN is some guidance to help me realize if I&#x27;m on the right track, or if I should completely change my life and go down an entirely different career path as a dev.

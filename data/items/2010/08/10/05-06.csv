1590590,comment,1590290,1590290,0,0,kalmar,,,"There can be something akin to meditation in walking, or ""taking a walk"".  An approach I've taken in the past is attempt to hear all the sounds.  Not to listen to, just hear.  Wherever you are, there are likely enough sounds for this.  If you catch yourself focusing on one sound, gently let it go back to the level of the rest.  If you find yourself not hearing sounds, gently let yourself hear them again.<p>I believe this is quite similar to bringing your mind back to the breath in sitting meditation in Vipassana and similar practices, though others may correct me.  The difference here is that it's perhaps somehow more obvious when your mind has strayed from its object.  In fact, there are forms of walking meditation in Vipassana and other practices.  These focus -- again, I believe -- much more on the walking: the walking and its sensations are the object.  Generally you would walk up and down a short stretch; this avoid the worry of a route, or how to return to the starting point.",1281419357

1590572,comment,1589345,1590418,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""And how can you compare beauty to potential to learn?""<p>There's a big difference between <i>potential</i> to learn and <i>actually</i> learning.  Yeah, everyone probably could, if they spent enough time at it, attain Ph.D levels of intellectual achievement.  But they won't.  At some point, they'll say ""This is stupid.  I have better things to do with my life,"" and go do those.<p>""Even in races the difference between the top world runner and his peers is not by much.""<p>There's not much difference between the top world runner <i>and his peers</i>.  There's a huge difference between the top world runner and you or me.  The people at the top of the field are <i>already</i> putting in as much effort as is humanly possible.  On top of that, they have talent.  There're lots more people who <i>also</i> put in as much effort as is humanly possible, but find they're still nowhere close to the top.  Usually, they get discouraged by this and choose a passion where their effort gives them a bit more reward.<p>""Genetically speaking we humans are pretty much identical.""<p>That all depends on how broadly you define ""identical"".  We share about 99.9% of our genes with other humans.  We share about 98% with chimpanzees.  Most people would say that there's a fairly large difference between a human and a chimpanzee.<p>In a broad sense, yeah, virtually everything alive is practically identical.  A human and an ebola virus are made of the same elemental building blocks, and the roughly million-fold difference in their size and complexity is peanuts compared to the breadth of the universe or the minisculeness of the Planck length.<p>But most of what makes us human is the ability to discriminate, the ability to look at details and pick out tiny differences.  So yeah, there's probably a few milliseconds separating the top two sprinters in the world.  But those few milliseconds might as well be an eternity for them.  The difference is probably irrelevant for a layperson, but it matters a lot for someone in the sport.<p>There's a distinction between ""everyone is equal"" and ""everyone is equal <i>at everything they do</i>"".  The former is a way of defining equality - I find it a pretty useful way, but I recognize that this says more about me than it does about the world.  The latter is just factually incorrect.",1281418815

The basic issue: Laying cable is expensive, but the marginal cost of fiber over bandwidth can be driven down in a variety of ways, and we have abundant fiber and rapid progress in photonics improving it at least as fast as Moore's law.<p>Wireless spectrum, by contrast, is horrifically expensive. These two companies own a lot of both, and would like to trade the uncertainty of the auction model for a set of agreed industrial targets.<p>Some parts are a joke, like the FCC having the authority to fine companies up to $2m after investigating bandwidth abuses on a case-by-case basis.

1590533,comment,1589823,1589823,0,0,city41,,,"I've never once used the dynamic keyword in a C# program, but I do ponder on it a lot. The new dynamic features in C# being able to provide a ""method_missing"" along with the emphasis on ""what it does"" over ""what it is"" is really intriguing to me. Can this be leveraged in any meaningful way in C#? Has anyone given it a real try yet? If so, should we even bother? Why not just stick with a language like Ruby then? It feels awkward to say the least to start doing this in a language like C#. Although most C# apps dive into reflection quite a bit to pull off similar functionality.<p>I am currently working on a Silverlight app using RIA Services. Here on the server side you have to have each CRUD method for each type you are surfacing. You can't do<p><pre><code>        public IQueryable<T> Get<T>() { }  \n  </code></pre>\nIt has to be<p><pre><code>        public IQueryable<Foo> GetFoos() { }\n        public IQueryable<Bar> GetBars() { }  \n  </code></pre>\nSame with all update, insert and delete methods. It drives me insane that I literally have several thousand lines of CRUD methods. Can some kind of dynamic solution jump in here and help? I doubt it, but I can dream. (Generics don't work here because RIA services can't support sending generic arguments across the wire).",1281417735

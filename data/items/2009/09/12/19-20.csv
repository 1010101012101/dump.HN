You had your working piece, which was supposed to be hard - it was stretching the abilities of what you could do as a violinist.  You had your polishing piece, which was your previous working piece where you were finessing all the fine points of technique and musicality.  You had review, which was all the other pieces you'd learned so far.  And you had your preps, which were little passages (4 measures or so) from your working piece that were so hard that you played them over and over again, way slowed down, until you got them right and could speed them up and incorporate them into your working piece.<p>I've tried to do something similar with my work so far - a working codebase that I'm just learning, a polishing codebase that I basically know my way around in, and various tweaks and bugfixes that I have to do for previous projects.  It's a bit harder in the corporate world though - while Google engineers are given a lot of freedom to pick their projects, they're still subject to the needs of the business, and sometimes a project will come up that's such a great opportunity for professional visibility that I'd want to take it even if it involves working hard on something I already know well and dropping the polishing of stuff I just learned.",1252785251

819316,comment,819131,819277,0,0,dasil003,,,"<i>Rasmus's point in the article is that as soon as you move away from simple apps under light load into real applications, it is no longer enough just to rely on Rails magic.</i><p>This seems backwards to me.  I consider PHP to be ideal for simple apps.  Rails comes with a certain amount of overhead (memory being the most important as far as cost is concerned), therefore I think it's only really useful for applications of a certain complexity.  What makes Rails useful are some basic architectural assumptions (MVC + a bunch of low level assumptions / web helpers) that are surprisingly applicable to a large chunk of web apps.  The magic is just some Ruby tricks to streamline things, but you don't ""rely on it"".  Where Rails tends to fall down are limitations of the Ruby runtimes, or applications where the web front-end is not a significant enough part of the problem to warrant the Rails approach.<p>PHP is similar in some ways--it includes many web-based assmptions, but it doesn't make any architectural assumptions, which means there is no way to benefit from common conventions (eg. knowing where to look for a certain file or class definition, what a variable or database table should be named, where is the default place to put certain types of logic, etc).  As such, PHP is better than any other raw language for web work, but it doesn't really allow you to easily utilize best practices that we've collectively learned over the last 15 years of web development.<p>That's not to say Rails is just plain better... to the contrary, I think PHP is a better <i>templating</i> language.  The difference is that with PHP you are better off moving to a real language for your back-end on any moderately complex application fairly quickly.  Rails, on the other hand, will let a significant portion of web apps (if not a majority) go quite far without any separate back-end.",1252784273

However, that's not my main point.<p>Ultimately, I think Twisted, due to the fact it does so much, is intimidating.  The documentation lacks succinct examples of how to implement the very basic things people want to implement.  The documentation to figure out how to make an app is buried under at least 3 clicks and even then isn't clear. The comments, when there are comments, in the examples don't truly explain the <i>why</i> of the actions just that they are there.<p>If twisted wants to be considered as a serious contender as foundation to develop web apps on, they need to take a look at how important very good documentation is to Django's success or how the simple, uncommented example at <a href=""http://www.tornadoweb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tornadoweb.org/</a> is more clear than the first bit of web example code at twisted: <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web/documentation/examples/silly-web.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web/documentation/examples...</a>.<p>I'm not knocking twisted, I'm trying to explain why when I went around evaluating what I would use in my projects, I did not choose Twisted.

But people who choose closed source projects tend to do so for their own set of reasons (mostly support and the fact that they don't have the time and/or skill to look through a languages source code to figure  out a bug themselves)<p>- Again, it's unreleased and you don't know what Microsoft will do with it.  At least for web development Microsoft makes free software available for using C# and VB.NET (called Visual Web Developer).  They could very well integrate F# into that.<p>- This is just opinion mixed in with conjecture (since again you're talking about an unreleased project with no real community yet)<p>- I've used Mono and found it very reliable so this is just misleading<p>Finally, you're quoting an article written by a guy trying to make the case to Microsoft developers.

Two possible approaches might be:<p>1. Use some sort of generative approach with hashing, salting, and a PRNG.  Advantage: minimal infrastructure.  Challenge: maximizing probability of a successful login, when the domains that don't like it might try to poison it.<p>2. Create some kind of P2P sharing for the logins.  Challenge: it should be as easy to install and use as the BugMeNot firefox plugin, or it will never catch on.<p>BugMeNot is practically useless now, since it seems to comply with all take-down requests.",1252782447

Not mentioned is the large memory footprint of a Rails process compared to a procedural PHP page.  It's the usual phenomenon of trading off development time and complexity for performance.  I'm sure if you wrote a web app in C, it would run even faster.<p>Rasmus's point in the article is that as soon as you move away from simple apps under light load into real applications, it is no longer enough just to rely on Rails magic.  You find yourself needing to understand the innards of what is a very complex environment, and dealing with an idiosyncratic development community that considers monkey-patching a neat programming techinique, and likes to publish its documentation in video format.<p>He doesn't seem to me to be saying 'don't use Rails'.

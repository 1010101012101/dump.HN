In these regions the compass points in the opposite direction, in or out of the core, compared to that of surrounding areas. It is the growth in area of such a reversed flux patch under the south Atlantic that is primarily responsible for the decay in the main dipolar field. This reverse patch is also responsible for the minimum in field strength called the South Atlantic Anomaly, centred over North-east Brazil. In this region energetic particles can approach Earth more closely, causing increased radiation risk to low Earth orbit satellites.</i><p><a href=""http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/reversals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/reversals.html</a>",1338263989

Outside of a synchronous or semi-synchronous (e.g. IRC) conversation, It's pretty hard to say anything worth saying in 140 characters. I hate twitter and I hate tl;dr as a meme. HN as a community tends to encourage longer posts for the same reason; they're more likely to be interesting.<p>It works better for sharing content, but I don't usually want to see all content that a particular person wants to share. Other mechanisms work better for getting a list of content to consume: RSS offers all the content from a particular source, and sites like HN and reddit show recent content that a particular community finds interesting.<p>The only thing I see twitter as <i>good</i> for is disseminating facts to a large audience when a non-internet-capable phone is the the only communication tool available. It has served that function a number of times during war, natural disasters and other breakdowns of civil infrastructure. Even so, I'd rather consume someone else's aggregation of the facts rather than track down which users to follow myself and unfollow them after the event is over.

4035883,comment,4035279,4035279,5,0,tzs,,,"Ah, I remember that time well. After graduating from Caltech in 1982, and then spending a month at a defense contractor (hired for an interesting project, project got cancelled before I started, and the alternative work they found for me sucked), I went to APh Technological Consulting, a Pasadena company consisting mostly of Caltech engineering graduates.<p>APh had done the electronics design, system software, development system, and early games for Mattel for the Mattel Intellivision. There were some amazing people there. Perhaps most memorable was Hal Finney, who later became well known as the second developer hired by PGP Corporation and as a cryptographic activist.<p>We were working on the next generation Intellivision when the crash happened (and I got laid off). APh was designing a new, much more powerful, GPU for the new system. For the prototype units we developed on the GPU consisted of a card cage with several hand wire wrapped circuit boards.<p>For everyone who was NOT Hal, this was a fairly typical occurrence:<p>1. work until very very late on your game, which is supposed to be shown at a closed demo at CES. Finally, you just have to go take sleep. Do so.<p>2. get back to work and you find a note from the hardware guys. They've rewired your GPU, adding or removing registers, changing graphics modes, sprite handling, and so on.<p>3. rewrite your code to deal with the hardware changes. Since all the code was in assembly language (for the annoying GI1620 processor), this was non-trivial and time consuming.<p>Somehow, Hal was immune to this. He could fix up his assembly code to cope with any change the hardware people made in just a few minutes.<p>Anyway, the article's point about poor quality third party games eroding consumer confidence is correct.<p>The first group of third party developers were fine. Activision was formed by former Atari developers. They knew the Atari system in and out, and could produce top quality games. Imagic was formed by Atari and Mattel people, and there were some former APh people there too. They understood the Intellivision and could produce top quality games.<p>The second generation of third party developers did not have that kind of knowledge. We saw independent Intellivison games that didn't take any advantage of the Intellivision system software--they just talked directly to the hardware. These games were almost all crap. The Intellivision firmware essentially consisted of a small game oriented operating system. It would let you do things like give it a sequence of images and a rate and it would animate a sprite with those images at that rate for you. You could give it a velocity and it would move that sprite for you. You could register event handlers that it would call when things collided, when controls were pressed, and so on.<p>It was that system software that let APh and Mattel write complex games like Baseball when limited to a 1k cartridge (actually, Baseball may have been a 2K cartridge) and something like 320 bytes of RAM. If you didn't take advantage of that system software and so had to do all that animation and event handling and hardware management code yourself you either had to restrict yourself to much simpler games, or you had to make a cartridge with bigger ROM and onboard RAM, which would greatly increase the price of your game.",1338263621

4035879,comment,4033866,4035801,1,0,creamyhorror,,,"Glad you asked. To us in Singapore, the South Koreans and Japanese actually look a tad excessive (what with their headbands and everything in that article). But it's more likely just a function of how they display their emphasis on school testing. We probably care as much about test results, but don't display it in the same way.<p>Test results matter when a majority of successful people got where they were because of their results. They did well in school and got good jobs (often in foreign MNCs); not many started their own businesses. Add to this the cultural motivation of wanting to keep up with the Joneses (being 'kiasu', in our lingo) and you have a strong incentive for parents to be all ""responsible"" for their kid by making sure she gets tutoring in whatever subjects she's weak in and she does additional practice outside of homework, often at a harder level than in school.<p>And of course, in the good schools, the ones that take in a higher-scoring crop of students, the teachers create harder test papers for their students to keep them motivated (we can't have everyone getting As now, can we?), and so parents go to tutoring companies with ""challenging"" or ""enriching"" programmes to make sure their kids keep up. The problems at this end of the pool get a bit ridiculous, and people end up complaining: <a href=""http://everythingalsocomplain.com/2011/09/10/primary-6-maths-exam-question-too-tough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everythingalsocomplain.com/2011/09/10/primary-6-maths...</a><p>The tide is turning slightly as new parents, freshly emerged from the competitive sea of schooling, take a less intense view of the importance of academic performance, and recognise that there are other paths that their kids can take in life that don't rely on test scores. We've opened specialist schools in arts, music, sports and design in recent years. But there's still a heavy economic pressure to do well and get good jobs in finance, medicine, law and so on, so I don't expect the culture of focus on education will weaken significantly in the near future.<p>I think the fundamentally different culture of American schools means that many Asian approaches will never transfer well; but there are still improvements that can be made, e.g. in the area of curriculum, in teacher training and ongoing development, etc. American schools are incredibly diverse in populations and practices; they have big weaknesses and big strengths. I think it would be good to have a unified tough-but-capable program for the struggling schools in poorer neighbourhoods, while letting strong/specialised schools do their thing. That would be something like the best of both worlds.",1338263597

4035872,comment,4034528,4035492,14,0,Cushman,,,"> Although I imagine we'll just start seeing a lot of silencers<p>I wouldn't bet on this. Suppressors are highly controlled Federally, and completely illegal to own in Illinois (and Iowa and Michigan and a number of other states as well). You may think that doesn't matter to criminals, but most illegal firearms are purchased legally at some point-- not gonna happen for suppressors. And they aren't mix-and-match; you need a threaded barrel for your gun specifically. (There's a nice little scene in Goodfellas about this problem.)<p>But let's say you get ahold of one. You've got a line with a crooked Class 3 dealer in Indiana (this is someone who is also allowed to sell machine guns and grenade launchers) and he decides he's gonna risk his life by selling to a gang banger. Fair enough. So you get home, you load up your 9mm, screw on your shiny new suppressor, and go outside to take a potshot at some asshole you got beef with. Two minutes later, a couple of squad cars show up, lights flashing.<p>What happened? Well, you got your suppressor, but you're still using your same old bog-standard black-market ammunition. The can turns the hearing-damaging bang of your gun into a merely very loud bang, but it does nothing about the supersonic crack your bullet makes. You were quieter, but far from <i>quiet</i>; a ShotSpotter that was close enough easily picked you out.<p>If your dealer was looking out for you, he would have mentioned this, and recommended you switch to a subsonic ammunition. If he was really looking out for you, he'd also mention that this ammunition has significantly reduced range and stopping power, and probably does not have enough operating pressure to reliably cycle your automatic-- meaning you need to cock your gun every other shot like Jack Bauer. Sounds pretty much ideal for your inner-city gang fight, right?<p>And lest we forget, when the fuzz finally catches up to you, whether with the ShotSpotter or with good-old-fashioned police work, you are not going to get slapped with possession and sent upstate. As soon as that suppressor gets entered into evidence, with its nicely filed-down serial number, they're going to make a phone call, and the ATF is going to come to town with some serious Federal prosecution heat. They will hang you up by your toes until you tell them who sold the thing to you, and then they will find that person and make them severely wish that they had not.<p>So... yeah. Don't bet on it.",1338263469

For them this is not only a game but a way of life. You cannot educate them. They will not listen. Anything you do will seem like an attempt to raise your prices. How do they react? They double their complaining. Trying to model their behaviour will drive you crazy.<p>One company that went through this is Pep Boys. They had an offer for a free oil change with any other service. Cheap people started taking their busted old cars to them. The cheap-o's would buy the lowest priced service that would give them the free oil change. Then come back to complain about unrelated problems. They would even go as far as suing Pep Boys for damages not related to the services performed. But small claims courts always sided with the poor abused customer. Cheap-o's actually made money on this. Go figure.
After years of this, Pep Boys finally saw the light and discontinued the practice. But it doesn't stop there. What did cheap-o's do? They complained to corporate HQ about the change.<p>Another point Sacha makes is that people who pay more ask for less support. Do you know why? Because they are your target customer. They ask for less support because they need the product, and trust you. They know that if something goes wrong you will be there to fix it. They show their trust in you by paying more. Its so simple. They also use your product as intended. And because your prodcut worked,  no complaints arised.<p>When people give you money they are not only buying the product, but they are placing their trust on you. Cheap-o's don't trust anybody. So they complain until they get their moneys worth (in the mind). Your target customer will be glad everything worked out, and will just be silently happy.<p>I'm going to copy and paste part of the conclusion to make a point.<p><i>No matter which strategy you choose, remember to consider the impact pricing will have on your customer base and your support costs. For example, a good strategy might be to start off with high prices, and then only lower them once youre ready to scale your support infrastructure.</i><p>I'm sorry Sacha, but you cannot start with high prices and then lower them. You start with fair prices and then raise them. If your support infrastructure requires higher costs, but your target customer cannot afford it, then the problem began when you chose to build your product. You need to figure out the costs of scaling before even starting. No need to be precise either, you can just make an estimate. Just make sure to err on the high side.<p>I would also say that pricing does not impact the customer base. It is the other way around. The customer base (or your average customer) is the key metric to set the price. Not your costs, but the customers.
Companies in the make-up industry know this. Most of the makeup out there is made by the same companies. The big difference is the customer they target. You can pick the same basic product from two different brands, and the prices will be very different. In some cases even downright insulting. What does a $200 lipstick have that a $10 one does not? A customer that will pay the price.<p>Sacha, good call on getting this point out in the open. This stuff needs to be discussed more by startups and hackers.",1338263116

4035845,comment,4035468,4035468,37,0,begriffs,,,"Reminds me of what Edsger Dijkstra wrote, ""Let me start with a well-established fact: by and large the programming community displays a very ambivalent attitude towards the problem of program correctness. A major part of the average programmer's activity is devoted to debugging, and from this observation we may conclude that the correctness of his programs or should we say: their patent incorrectness? is for him a matter of considerable concern. I claim that a programmer has only done a decent job when his program is flawless and not when his program is functioning properly only most of the time. But I have had plenty of opportunity to observe that this suggestion is repulsive to many professional programmers: they object to it violently! Apparently, many programmers derive the major part of their intellectual satisfaction and professional excitement from not quite understanding what they are doing. In this streamlined age, one of our most under-nourished psychological needs is the craving for Black Magic, and apparently the automatic computer can satisfy this need for the professional software engineers, who are secretly enthralled by the gigantic risks they take in their daring irresponsibility. They revel in the puzzles posed by the task of debugging. They defend by appealing to all sorts of supposed Laws of Nature the right of existence of their program bugs, because they are so attached to them: without the bugs, they feel, programming would no longer be what is used to be! (In the latter feeling I think if I may say so that they are quite correct.)"" -- From EWD288",1338262976

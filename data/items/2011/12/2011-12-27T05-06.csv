(X could be, for example, quicksort.)  Graphs, algorithms, and data structures are essential, but nobody is going to ask you ""implement a binary tree""; that is way too easy to study for.  (I'm guessing that discrete math questions are also common; but because of the position I was interviewing for, they replaced those with testing and refactoring questsions.  Which was good, because I was never good at discrete math.) I had not seen any of the questions they asked before, and two of them were interesting enough to keep me thinking about them for several days.  (I was disappointed to discover, while implementing my solution to one, how easy it is to brute-force problems involving English words.  There just aren't very many words.  But the idea is what counts, and brute-force is not going to get you hired :)<p>Since I've been hired by Google, people have pointed me at a lot of ""popular media"" articles or videos about Google, and not many have matched my experience, but then again, I haven't actually started work yet.<p>(The linked article also talks about Bank of America intervewing, which doesn't have a standardized process.  I know because I worked there and asked different questions, 100% chosen by me,  every time I interviewed someone.  So while one person at Bank of America may have asked ""What animal are you?"", that's not some sort of company policy.

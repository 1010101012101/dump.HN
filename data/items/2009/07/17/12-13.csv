All that effort was wasted as all of them ended up running on Postgres only. Unless you're absolutely sure that you're going to need support for multiple databases, my suggestion is that you use the technique from the end of the article: put all of your DB access code in separate classes so you can easily swap them with different ones should the need arise. Until then, save yourself some trouble and make your product work really well with one database engine.",1247835201

Empirically speaking, it seems almost (but not absolutely) impossible for humans.<p>People should learn economics like you learn physics [1].  You don't start out with string theory (fortunately).  You start with the Greeks, then move to Galileo, Euler, Newton, Laplace, Maxwell, Bohr, Einstein, Feynman, etc.<p>In macro economics, that might read: Bastiat, Locke, Smith, Mill, Malthus, Marx, Engels, Mussolini (who would typically be expunged, despite his continuing relevance, for obvious political reasons), Mises, Keynes, Hayek, Friedman, Rothbard.<p>[1] There are obvious differences, of course.  Economics has more forks and fewer merges in the tree of thought (which makes knowing the history all the more important).  And unlike physics, old, discredited theories get dug back up, polished, and repeated for a new generation (how many times do we have to endure CNN talking about how a hurricane will help the economy before people understand the broken window fallacy that Bastiat articulated in <i>1850</i>?).

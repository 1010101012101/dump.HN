2828229,comment,2825689,2826540,1,0,true_religion,,,"I doubt that <i>every</i> single customer has to be on their own VM. It's more likely that many people share the same VM, and only larger customers need their own VM.<p>Let's run some numbers though, using your assumptions:<p>500 VMs @ $179 per customer (business class licence) means a little over $1,000,000. At that point, you'd be right---it wouldn't scale.<p>However, this is a <i>business</i> and not an HR exercise. So you could easily hire less people, and have less reliability. For a business like Shopify, I imagine their best customers are those who pay the $99 plan, accept a transaction cost, and other limitations. These customers can be piled onto the same VM together, and probably don't have such a huge throughput that a few minutes of downtime means money lost.",1312117011
2828228,comment,2827882,2828157,1,0,_delirium,,,"For ""why not"", I suppose it depends on whether the factory has any downsides. Traditionally they have some pros and some cons: they bring jobs and tax revenue and a thriving ""stuff is happening"" feeling to the local economy, but they can also bring things like odors, air and water pollution, noise, increased truck traffic, and possibly requirements for new infrastructure (e.g. wider roads). That's why new factories can run into opposition in a way that new Google offices don't.<p>I agree they bring some needs for service as well, but even that might be non-local. In the story I can't seem to find, that was (correctly or not) a complaint of the local government, that of the people the factory <i>did</i> employ, many weren't even locally based, but Parisians who worked remotely for a third-party servicing firm, and drove out to the factory only when needed.",1312116972

It took quite a lot of work to get a PR2 to fold laundry (and some of the best robotics people in the world worked on this). The kinds of tasks I imagined Foxconn workers performed all require significant manual dexterity.<p>For an amazing use of robots in a factory environment, I would suggest a tour of BMW's Munich factory. They have a whole bunch of specialized robotic arms that do things like welding, lifting, painting, etc. Their factory still employs humans (albeit fewer humans). In BMW's case, their use of robotics makes sense. Foxconn, not so much.<p>Finally, there are some completely automated car factories. I thought Hyundai's US factory manufactured cars solely with robots. However, I believe they have a higher defect rate (partially due to this process).<p>Edit: Link to the PR2 laundry folding robot - <a href=""http://www.willowgarage.com/blog/2010/04/02/towels-uc-berkeley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.willowgarage.com/blog/2010/04/02/towels-uc-berkel...</a>",1312115250

2828188,comment,2827452,2827452,8,0,adamt,,,"My personal experience contradicts this - and as context to that statement I've raised about 10 rounds from EU, US and Asian investors.<p>Some of his points (e.g. about not being shopworn) have some validity, but that can be avoided/mitigated with the right positioning and the upsides outweigh it.<p>My advice would be:<p>* Make it really clear you're not raising money yet. Don't pitch, don't take any slides/laptop, just have coffee with them. Talk about your business in a straight-forward/relaxed manner. This often bypasses the VC's pitch-defences (they've had 10 businesses already that week talk about how spectacular they are, and how they are world-leaders in a billion dollar market).<p>* Position it that at some point in the future once you've hit your next milestones. Define those milestones as things you feel extremely confident (and not just as an optimistic entrepreneur) that you will hit.<p>* At the end of the meeting, if you think you like them, ask them - 'so would you be interested in hearing from us when we're ready with our round?' as a soft conditional-close. VC's never like to say no (they just show interest, then stall), so they'll give you a yes as it costs them little. Also be prepared to ask their advice and for intros and use the fact VC's talk to your advantage. Ask them if this deal is in their space, and if not, are there any VC's they'd recommend you spoke to. Second only to making money VC's like to look smart and networked. So if you're credible, they can often introduce you to other VCs, or even useful industry contacts.<p>* When you are then ready to raise, you have a warm prospect you can call on, and you gain credibility by hitting the milestones you talked about. It should be easy to position the partner you first spoke to into an internal champion, by letting him position it as a company he'd been tracking for a while, and that they are one of the first people you'd pitched to as a result.",1312115207

2828186,comment,2827533,2827916,4,0,xtracto,,,"You hit what I think is a critical point but with some anti-Microsoft bias.<p>My view is that Microsoft itself simplified the PC experience quite well for a set of users during the 80s and early 90s. With DOS and Windows 3.11.<p>During this time, a lot of people who were not ""computer experts"" at that time were able get things done with the computer. Even if it was ""painful"" to do something (all those commands in the command prompt), people would do it beacuse they will achieve some result.<p>Then the Monopoly became evident, and around the time of Windows 95 Microsoft realized they did not need to make things simple to users, but instead users had to <i>learn</i> how to use their tools. This is what you get right; Microsoft did not need to do <i>anything</i> between Windows 95 and Windows XP to get money. People <i>needed</i> to use Microsoft products because other people used them and if you dared to use Qpro, Apple products or anything else, then your workflow was not compatible with the general workflow of everybody else.<p>This is were Apple (I guess, Steve Jobs) got it right. They looked all the ""paper cuts"" [c.f. Canonical] that people thought were ""normal"" (remember the ""normal"" BSOD?) and focused on doing products where people did not have to go through all those issues. More importantly, they <i>learnt</i> how to do that. How to detect those ""paper cuts"" and how to fix them.<p>In the 20 years that Microsoft monopoly served them, they lost the ability to do that. They lost the ability to know how to make things <i>easier</i> for the users; I suppose all that got mixed within the convoluted bureaucracy within the company. You actually can see some of that in the way Bill's mail is treated: The concerned people do not ""get it"", what is wrong with Bill's scenario; they just open a ""ticket"" to fix the Media player problem... and surely a download of Media Player appeared on Microsoft's front webpage next Monday. But they did not attack the underlying problem.<p>I agree with you that with Windows 7 Microsoft is doing better. But as you, I also think that they still have not ""got"" the talent they lost a long time ago of being able to make things easier.<p>I always thought that it would have been better (from the point of view of technology progress) if  Microsoft had split in the 3 sub-companies when they were sued back in the day.

I don't know if this is a UK phenomenon, a western phenomenon, or just a thing that people do, but the majority of people <i>who choose to disclose to me</i> that they have a mental illness are self-diagnosed. CFS is one of those things (like ADHD and Asperger's) that is very appealing to people who have certain problems. I don't think this disease will be taken seriously until we actually have diagnostic criteria, proper names, proper understanding... Overall, acceptance of mental issues as real problems is definitely growing in this country.",1312114467

It sucks. A lot. I still think it's a mental illness. The difference between me and most people is that I don't think that makes it ""fake"" or ""not real"" in any sense at all, but I'm sure if you told your boss you were too tired to get out of bed because of a mental illness, you'd be laughed at. So what? The same could apply with major depression, less people would argue that depression doesn't exist.<p>People like you are holding us back, people using reasoning similar to yours are justifying this campaign of harrassment upon researchers that are just trying to find the <i>truth</i>. They're not trying to prove people with CFS are lazy, or making it up, or even that it's all in the head - they want what everyone who has the disease <i>should</i> want - to find out what it is.<p>An additional warning to anyone wanting to compare anecdotes: CFS is a ""diagnosis of exclusion"". This is a fancy way of saying that actually, we don't have a definition for this disease. It's entirely possible that multiple poorly-understood diseases with similar symptoms are leading to a single diagnosis (""CFS"") at present, which complicates any effort to share experiences.<p>On the front of these people sending in death threats... I know quite a few people that claim to have CFS. Some of them quite clearly do not have the same thing as me, were not diagnosed by doctors, and would resist quite violently any attempts to re-classify them. They enjoy having a label they can hide behind, I guess.<p>Lastly I want to say: This is a real thing, or at least, there are things we don't understand and this is the label that gets put on it. I don't know for sure what I had, I don't know if it was physical or mental, but it was real. I've encountered many people, including licensed doctors, that mock and denigrate people with this condition, and if you are one of those people I would implore you to rethink your position. We know very little about the connection between our physical and mental well-being, but at this point it's incredibly clear that there is a very strong link, and that mental issues can cause very real, physically observable and empirically testable problems.",1312114142
2828168,comment,2827349,2827554,2,0,vsync,,,"Your other objections are interesting and I want to research them further. But I wonder how this comment doesn't prove the editorial's point:<p>> It does delegitimise the extremely severe nature of the illness.<p>How does merely positing a psychosomatic origin for the syndrome ""delegitimise"" its ""extreme severity""?  Or is it you thinking that mental health is somehow less important than physical health, which doesn't even make sense considering the brain is an organ too?<p>> Psycho-social explanations of CFS seem to be nothing more than ""hysteria"" rebadged for more modern times. It's easier to say ""Well, maybe it's your fault!"" than to accept the hopelessness of not knowing what's going on.<p>Uh huh.  And it's easier to take the idea of mental health being relevant as a personal insult, like people are saying it's one's own fault, than to accept the hopelessness of not knowing there's a magical cure as soon as the doctors discover the sole physical cause.<p>Again, I really want to read further on research being done on CFS and other subjective and idiopathic syndromes.  It's interesting from a medical and social standpoint and I'm close with several people who suffer with such issues.  But I've also seen their blind spots related to the issue.  I'd like to hear more on the work that's disproven psychiatric origins of the syndrome, since while the editorial touched on Wessley it seemed more to be talking about the need to explore all possible causes and solutions of a problem affecting many.",1312114136

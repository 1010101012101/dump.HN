I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s better to have a known good state than it is to be kept up to date with the latest versions of libraries automatically. It&#x27;s not that hard to upgrade an existing library. I personally find it harder to find a library at all.<p>I keep a separate hard drive for project stuffs. It&#x27;s not just for source code or image files, I also install the software I use to work there. Tools, IDEs, libraries, content packs, documentation, anything necessary for work, goes on that hard drive.<p>That way, in the case of a full OS reinstall, I at least have the program installation directories as a TODO list.<p>Also, all of my code is in Github somewhere.

Math is used to construct models, and prove that certain results would be expected from a given model. That doesn&#x27;t mean the models work in the real world; all sciences use experiments to test models to see if they describe actual observations.<p>In this sense, you always need to be careful about replication, regardless of field. If you can&#x27;t show replication, then there is no guarantee that the model will always match observations, no matter how much math went into the construction of that model.<p>In Physics the main problem is isolating variables, and setting up appropriate conditions. The good thing about Physics is that once the environment is set up and the experiment is well designed, it is easy to re-run the experiment for more trials. With chemistry and biology, this is usually the case as long as you have clean reagents in a clean lab, but you are introducing more factors of what you have to control as the complexity of your system scales up.<p>It is hardest to replicate results involving humans, because with humans you have a lot of complexity, so you know you can never control all influencing factors. Usually in the social sciences, it is easier to hope these factors cancel out with a large, non-homogenous sample size. The problem as these experiments like SPE demonstrate is that it is hard to build an ideal sample and, if the ethics or practicality of your methods are questioned, rerun the experiment to replicate results.",1406130691

As a programmer, we write and iterate on code until it is ready to be published to the upstream repository. Our tooling has come about to help take our rough and ugly hacks and massage them into well written code we can be proud to push.<p>Also, banging out code is overrated.

Though I remember a particular nasty case from my childhood - a man in Oslo was committed with a diagnosis of paranoid delusions in 1971 after having been involved in a political struggle related to a school closure. His claims about violations of various laws in the process intended to close down the school were used as evidence of his supposed delusions. He was not released from the hospital until 1985. At which point he refused to leave the hospital, and camped outside it until near his death in 1996, while campaigning to have his diagnosis reversed.<p>The utterly bizarre situation was that he insisted that if the diagnosis stood, then he should be admitted, but the hospital refused - claiming he was too well to be admitted even voluntarily, while still insisting he still suffered from paranoid delusions.<p>In 1988 an investigation indicated that he was likely sane when admitted, though he may at some point later have suffered from mental problems caused or exacerbated by his forced hospitalisation.<p>In <i>1995</i> the relevant government department gave him a formal apology, admitting that the claims he first made in 1968, that was used as evidence of delusions in order to have him forcibly admitted, were in fact true... Nobody were willing to admit that the hospitalisation was politically motivated, but given the fact it&#x27;s hard to conclude otherwise.<p>It shows how insidious claims like these could be: Everything he did to fight his hospitalisation and diagnosis was used as additional evidence of his supposed insanity.<p>I like to think that cases like this doesn&#x27;t occur anymore..",1406129071

While I agree with the general notion that neuroscientists need to get better at using statistical methods and tools, I wonder if the author of the blog you linked (Zalocusky) maybe makes the problem out to be somewhat different than as it is described in the original review.<p>Specifically Zalocusky is trying to link the neuroscience results to an earlier article by Ioannidis [1]. Whereas article [0] makes the conclusion that neuroscience results are unreliable and hard to reproduce, Zalocusky is applying the older methods and results from [1] that this means neuroscience results are not only unreliable but also false, which is a stronger statement. To support this, Zalocusky adds in a couple of back-of-the-napkin calculations.<p>I think a bit more analysis and caution is necessary before making the leap from Ioannidis&#x27; 2013 claim about neuroscience research to Zalocusky&#x27;s stronger claim about neuroscience research.<p>Incidentally there was a lot of discussion about Ioannidis&#x27; 2005 paper, some which can be seen by Ioannidis&#x27; 2007 response to earlier criticism of the paper [2]. When evaluating claims about entire fields of research, it is important to be careful about how we interpret these claims.<p>edit: We need to be especially careful when using the word false.

They panicked about the lack of IDE support and refactoring tools.<p>&quot;IDE support is immature.&quot; Response: well, true, but you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> an IDE. Java makes IDEs mandatory because it&#x27;s a crappy, verbose language. Scala doesn&#x27;t. Clojure especially doesn&#x27;t. Haskell doesn&#x27;t (although convincing that company to move off the JVM would have been impossible).<p>&quot;Where are the refactoring tools?&quot; Response: when you have good static typing, the compiler is <i>far</i> better at enforcing refactoring safety than any tools on the market. (Java itself combines the worst of static and dynamic typing.)<p>People-- especially non-programming managers-- have become dependent on the trappings of productivity that they&#x27;ve forgotten what actual work looks like. Java culture is full of this nonsense.

What&#x27;s really going on is that execs and professional managers can&#x27;t evaluate the work in most specialties, so they&#x27;ve decided to pretend that specialties don&#x27;t exist. All types of programming get thrown together into &quot;it&#x27;s all code; just make the thingy work&quot; and what that means is that programmers get stuck cleaning up <i>any</i> kind of technical mess they have the bad fortune of having thrown to them. The result is that a good number of programmers (those who aren&#x27;t savvy enough to play the game and be selective in what work they do) end up learning a bunch of crappy, parochial, non-transferrable &quot;how we do things here&quot; details but (a) never get a coherent career or develop the ability to protect a specialty, and (b) are constantly learning &quot;new&quot; but ill-thought-out and incoherent things.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I used to think that this was a &quot;new&quot; problem, or a symptom of the industry getting worse.

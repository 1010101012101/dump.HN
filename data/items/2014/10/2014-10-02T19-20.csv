These days, we&#x27;re out of touch with Fire.<p>Which is why everyone should go camping, and be forced to start their own fire with only matches (no fire-starter).  I&#x27;d say with a couple sticks, but then they&#x27;d never go camping again.<p>Starting a fire, tending it, cooking over it, and sitting around it and telling stories/playing games is one of the best experiences one can have, it&#x27;s fun, frustrating, satisfying, and enlightening all at the same time (just put the phones away though).",1412279964

8402751,comment,8401047,8402577,2,0,Cshelton,,,"In rudimentary percussion, techniques similar to instructors like Paul Rennick, you actually do move your wrist twice for a double stroke. No matter the tempo. Staying very relaxed and letting rebound bring the stick back up so you can &quot;throw&quot; it back down is very crucial. But also, I can play articulate double strokes at a fast tempo on a pillow, but this requires your wrist to simulate the rebound with muscle, which is not recommend for long periods of playing. Unless you want very bad wrist problems later on. But every proper double stroke, even triple stroke is a wrist movement. The exception is what&#x27;s called a &quot;huc-a-dic&quot;, which is 3 bounces with each bounce being lower than the previous one. But each tap is still &#x27;placed&#x27; to a certain extent so when you play on a line with other people, you are all together perfectly.",1412279944

This is because we can assume more about the structure of a valid hash -- a lower target means more leading zeros which are assumed to be zero in the SAT-based algorithm.&quot;<p>This is actually pretty misleading. There might be fewer variables, but that&#x27;s irrelevant. Yes, there are actually fewer variables in the actual file you feed to the SAT solver because you can assume they are 0 and propagate that to the other constraints involving those variables. But think about it -- you&#x27;re only going to get rid of a couple of hundred variables at most, in a problem with ~250,000 variables. So you&#x27;re only really reducing the full search space by an incredibly small percentage.<p>In practice, the running time of the SAT solver increases exponentially with the number of zeros you assume in the hash, just like it does for a regular brute force trying all combinations of inputs.<p>The conclusion I draw from this is that not all variables contribute equally to the difficulty of a problem (for a SAT solver). This is actually why SAT solvers can be efficient for some problems in the first place, even for problems with hundreds of thousands of variables; the SAT solver (a smart brute force, as opposed to a naive brute force) is able to exploit the fact that many problems you feed to it are not intrinsically hard.",1412279141

Like Context.IO, they see the value of helping developers build apps that interact with email. Building a platform like Context.IO, that abstracts complex systems, involves more technical challenges and product-level decisions, than you can keep track of. So, it’s not a surprise that our two teams came to different conclusions and have built somewhat different solutions. InboxApp made a choice to cache 100% of the email data, hoping to solve potential availability issues, which is key for some use cases. As a result, developers on that platform need to cover the costs for storing that data, whether or not they need it. We&#x27;ve worked with and spoken to hundreds of developers over the last few years and learned that the vast majority don&#x27;t need that model and do not want to carry those costs. In the few cases where the dev needs a cache of every single message, many decide to store the data they need, instead of relying on a third party to store everything in their users’ mailbox.<p>If speed is the utmost concern and you are able to charge your users enough for your product to cover the cost of the platform while keeping your business afloat, then paying $5 a month per account might be cost-effective. However, if you prefer to use a header caching layer and you can engineer around caching the bodies, then using Context.IO for free is a better fit.<p>Just a couple quick points I should mention. Context.IO stores all of the message headers in our caching layer. Combined with our webhooks, applications are quickly notified of a change and can easily retrieve messages they care about.

The first 10 patients who have utilized this program include patients with memory loss associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), or subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). Nine of the 10 displayed subjective or objective improvement in cognition beginning within 3-6 months, with the one failure being a patient with very late stage AD. Six of the patients had had to discontinue working or were struggling with their jobs at the time of presentation, and all were able to return to work or continue working with improved performance. Improvements have been sustained, and at this time the longest patient follow-up is two and one-half years from initial treatment, with sustained and marked improvement. These results suggest that a larger, more extensive trial of this therapeutic program is warranted. The results also suggest that, at least early in the course, cognitive decline may be driven in large part by metabolic processes. Furthermore, given the failure of monotherapeutics in AD to date, the results raise the possibility that such a therapeutic system may be useful as a platform on which drugs that would fail as monotherapeutics may succeed as key components of a therapeutic system.",1412278590

Now the next logical question: Has the human race produced 464,000 hours of video content?<p>Let&#x27;s assume there are around 100 cable channels showing content in HD video 24/7 (with no overlap, there are more but a lot of duplication). That&#x27;s 2,400 hours of content a day, 876,000 hours a year or 101 years back-to-back worth of watchable content shown each year.<p>But realistically that will be at least 70% duplication (particularly looking at it over several years).

8402550,comment,8401162,8401162,0,0,hosh,,,"In the old stories and myths, Fire was the inspiration. The spark. The kindling. It&#x27;s flames lighting up the dark naturally attracts people to gather in, to look inward instead of outward into the shadows. Fire can&#x27;t travel far from it&#x27;s source of fuel, it must be carried like a torch. One of the first things you learn about Fire is that fire is meant to be shared.<p>Some of the older cultures have a fire tending tradition. For some, the &quot;fire starter&quot; was a sacred, and respected skill. In others, a boy or a girl was initiated into the tradition by given a fire to tend when they come of age (around 10 - 12). They tend to it all their lives, merge the fires when they get married. When their children becomes of age, they start a fire for the children from their own fire. When they die, that fire they have tended all their lives cremates their body for the final time.<p>Modern-day Fire rituals are not confined to the candle or the flame or turning on the TV. Running a torch around the world is an example.<p>These days, we&#x27;re out of touch with Fire. We typically control it in the form of gas fuel lines or electricity (lightning, in the old stories are considered a different form of fire). Your mom probably told you not to touch the stove, because it is hot and it will hurt. We have fire-safety drills. We have fireman who comes in to wipe out the fire, lauded as heroes. The typical story we have around Fire these days involve explosions, anger, and destruction. Lots of mad cackling.<p>The old stories of Fire, on the other hand, speak about inspiration, will and drive. Fire worked with the other elements: Earth to contain it and is itself the fuel and raw materials; Water to circulate and transport heat; Wind to stoke it up. Fire is to be respected, both the fire in the campfire and the fire within your belly.<p>When you lead people in your quest to make it big, change the world, or to get rich, is your inner fire that of anger, rage, suffering, and destruction? Is your &quot;disruption&quot; story another fancy way of saying attack and ill will? Is it another way of saying you&#x27;re going to take over the world and control it with power?<p>Or is your inner fire inspirational? Is it the clear, cleansing fire that burns the darkness you carry within? Is it the kind of fire that you&#x27;d share with friends?  Is your inner fire the warmth of your love and the light of your vision?",1412277752

And, actually, early versions of that were broken: there was a way to ask how much memory remains before trying the memory allocation request, with no way to know whether it succeeded.<p>Guess what? This was fixed in the ISO standard.<p>See here, the ISO function reference on modula2.org:<p><a href=""http://modula2.org/reference/isomodules/isomodule.php?file=STORAGE.DEF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modula2.org/reference/isomodules/isomodule.php?file=S...</a><p><pre><code>  PROCEDURE ALLOCATE (VAR addr: SYSTEM.ADDRESS; amount: CARDINAL);\n    (* Allocates storage for a variable of size amount and assigns the address of this\n       variable to addr. If there is insufficient unallocated storage to do this, the\n       value NIL is assigned to addr.\n    *)\n</code></pre>\nSo ISO Modula 2 has an allocator that pretty much exactly like malloc and free. (It&#x27;s worse: DEALLOCATE needs to know the size!)<p>If Pascal&#x27;s way was better, it would have survived into Modula-2.<p>Also, Modula-2 has I/O functions that you try first, and then check the result. Streams are called &quot;channels&quot;:<p><pre><code>  PROCEDURE ReadRestLine (cid: IOChan.ChanId; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR);\n    (* Removes any remaining characters from the input stream cid before the next line mark,\n       copying to s as many as can be accommodated as a string value. The read result is set\n       to the value allRight, outOfRange, endOfLine, or endOfInput.\n    *)\n</code></pre>\nMore like C, again.

There <i>will</i> be a new major version of PHP: so-called PHP 7 to avoid confusion with the defunct first attempt at a PHP 5 successor.[1] This new major version will contain a completely new engine[2] that is definitely not backwards-compatible with PHP 5 extensions (though it should be backwards-compatible with userland code). The new major version also opens the door for any userland-level breaking to the language; the first three of which are a change to integer semantics,[3] an AST,[4] and a uniform variable syntax.[5]<p>Instead, I&#x27;d characterize PHP 5.3-5.6 as more pragmatic than visionary: PHP 6&#x27;s major backwards-incompatible feature was going to be full Unicode support, and when that didn&#x27;t pan out, PHP 6 no longer had a raison d&#x27;être. Instead of holding onto a number of useful language features for a few more years until a new major backwards-incompatible change was developed (now the new parse engine), they backported them to PHP 5.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phpng"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phpng</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://wiki.php.net/rfc/integer_semantics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/integer_semantics</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://wiki.php.net/rfc/abstract_syntax_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/abstract_syntax_tree</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://wiki.php.net/rfc/uniform_variable_syntax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/uniform_variable_syntax</a>",1412276510

Creating a mesh network to serve a large website is overkill, cost-wise. So you do what you can, and then you implement things like continuous integration, monitoring, trending, alerting and escalation procedures to be ready for the eventual failure.<p>In my experience, relying on a service provider designed to increase reliability (let&#x27;s say Akamai) will smooth out the great majority of problems a live website might have with availability. One really reliable datacenter will keep the big problems at bay, leaving you to get good at iterating over common minor issues like maintenance and local performance issues.",1407783125

I’m not an adderall (or similar) user, but as a startup co-founder I can totally see the appeal of it that drives others—people much like myself—to it.<p>The first thing that stood out to me was the normalization of this in the San Francisco/Silicon Valley culture, which casually overlooks or ignores the risks involved. Not one person I know in tech who&#x27;s taken it recreationally has ever made mention of the risks, perhaps because they don&#x27;t think they experience any side-effects (or they&#x27;re not impeding enough for them to care).<p>Then, the pressure of being the &quot;10x&quot; performer is very real; hero programmer or startup co-founder, you&#x27;re weirdly expected by the tech environment—rarely by individuals, in fact—to be able to pull off amazing productivity and quality. Especially as a startup founder, this pressure—if you&#x27;re susceptible to it—can lead to a very pro-work, anti-social [activities] feeling, which is isolating and subtly demoralizing on an [inter-]personal level.<p>Lastly, the part in the piece about reasons people use to self-diagnose away any symptoms of ADHD and argue (again, to themselves) that they don&#x27;t have ADHD spoke to me in a very eye-opening manner. I&#x27;ve done <i>all</i> of those things, and have felt miserable over them. Now, my &#x27;symptoms&#x27; could still be caused by the stress of being a startup founder, but this piece set me on the course to explore and treat it as potentially a real condition I can get medication for. Or, find out it&#x27;s not that (for me), and have the comfort of knowing this is something I can reduce by reducing my stress. Either way, I&#x27;m immensely grateful for this piece.",1407783027

If you &quot;win&quot; the lottery you pay a fine of some sort.  It&#x27;s like speeding tickets in cars; they don&#x27;t ensure 100% compliance with the speed limit but a rough approximation by fining some people who don&#x27;t obey.<p>I agree with you that these are ways to change behavior and I would also agree that they&#x27;re fairly effective.  But I am not sure that they motivate people in non-economic methods.  I think they just shift the landscape of the economics.<p>I think one possible way to motivate people to do something without economics is to make it illegal but poorly enforced.  This will encourage contrarians to engage in it just out of spite.  I&#x27;ll agree that spite probably isn&#x27;t the best driver of change but it&#x27;s all I can come up with.  This is supposedly what Frederick II did in Prussia during the 1700s to encourage people to cultivate potatoes for the sake of diversifying the food supply.<p>The other way I&#x27;ve heard of motivating people to do things is basically to ask politely.  I saw a study somewhere (can&#x27;t find the link after 10min) that compliance with the law is inversely proportional to the amount of force.

Many 3d model interchange formats use the latter because it saves some bytes. All 3D APIs use the former.<p>But this example works exactly the same way on every 3d API out there. Having a single index per vertex (rather than separate indices into position, normal, texcoord arrays) simplifies the vertex pipeline a little bit.<p>Using a single index will also make more efficient caching of vertex data and post-transform caching (ie. output of vertex shaders are cached if possible). Separate indices would need more complicated cache addressing.<p>Of course, with modern OpenGL, you can do more complicated addressing of data in the vertex shader. This isn&#x27;t likely going to increase performance, though.<p>However, this is largely a non-issue. Modern 3d graphics simply isn&#x27;t limited by the number of vertices or triangles. Having to duplicate some data isn&#x27;t going to make a significant difference in practice.<p>Also, you can toggle the interpolation mode for varying variables (ie. fragment shader inputs) so you can use per-vertex normals and make them flat shaded if your whole model is going to be flat shaded.",1407782757

8164549,comment,8163934,8164275,7,0,mrb,,,"For starters, the incentives are just not there to destroy Bitcoin. Most governments are either positive or neutral toward Bitcoin. The ones that are hostile toward it would rather make it illegal to fight it with the law instead of with technical attacks. Financial corporations? The smart ones would realize they would benefit more from embracing Bitcoin than fighting it. And the non-smart ones don&#x27;t even realize how much of a threat Bitcoin may be to their business models.<p>But let&#x27;s just go with your assumption that some entity with big pockets decide to run a majority attack against Bitcoin miners. How much effort and money would it require?<p>1 year and 20 billion dollars; here is why:<p>The best 20-28nm mining ASICs require about 1 watt per Ghash/sec. The network is currently at 170,000,000 Ghash/sec so it would require at least 170 megawatt of ASICs, or a ~200 megawatt datacenter (with PUE = 1.15). The fastest TOP500 supercomputer facilities barely reach 20 megawatt. The biggest datacenters in the world are just about 100 megawatt. So the attacker would require two of the world&#x27;s most powerful datacenters (in terms of electricity and cooling) to attack Bitcoin. But it would take at least 1 year to plan, design, build, and deploy the hardware in two such facilities. And the Bitcoin network will continue to grow during this time. It has grown by 400x in the last year (400,000 to 170,000,000 Ghash/sec). By the lowest estimate, the network will grow <i>at least</i> by 10x in the next year (170,000,000 Ghash/sec to 1,700,000,000 Ghash/sec). So you need to plan to build not 2, but 20 world-class 100 megawatt datacenters by August 2015 to be ready to have a chance to majority-attack Bitcoin. Knowing that a 100 megawatt datacenter costs $1 billion [1], you need pockets with $20 billion in them. And if you under-estimate the growth of the Bitcoin network in the next 12 months, you will have failed and wasted $20 billion for nothing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.greendatacenternews.org/articles/share/416983/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greendatacenternews.org/articles/share/416983/</a>",1407782305

So it seems a bit disingenuous to treat a centimeter as a distinct unit when it&#x27;s really just 1 x 10^-2 meters.<p>The whole &quot;conversion factors&quot; thing seems like a superfluous gimmick.  Why would you start working with one unit, then spontaneously decide to start using a different unit in the same context?  But in the unusual circumstance where you <i>would</i> need to switch units, perhaps due to a shift in the scale you&#x27;re operating at, the metric system still prevents you from using a unit appropriate to the context, and limits you to only scaling a less appropriate unit up or down by a power of ten.<p>It really is just scientific notation re-implemented in a bizarre and arcane way.  With customary units, you can still represent quantities with scientific notation, and use inches, feet, miles, etc. as your base unit as the context demands, but you&#x27;ve still got a variety of base units to choose from, each more optimal than the others when operating its appropriate context.",1407782274

With a more formal description of each function call, including predicates for parameters, and possibly the context itself, they make things way easier for user land, where these could be mechanically translated into API bindings, and thus checked automatically. If all these checks are made on the user side, then they may add a simple toggle in the API to remove the checks on the driver side. Most users aren&#x27;t using the C API directly anyway, and people writing bindings would welcome specs which could be mechanically translated into their favorite language bindings.

Your friend may have contempt for this particular law, so in this case,  this profit is an assumption of risk.  Illegal activities tend to be quite profitable because they are higher risk.<p>Honestly, though, I doubt there&#x27;s all that much risk to this.  Maybe even less than renting out to a permanent tenant (who has powerful rights in SF).<p>Unfortunately, SF seems to be unusually good at passing restrictive laws with low enforcement, encouraging people to test the limits and profit, and making chumps of people who follow the rules.  I just paid over $8k for permits (hell, I paid a few hundred in permit fees to replace my windows and furnace with energy efficient ones).  In response, SF wouldn&#x27;t allow me to put a sink in my laundry room &quot;to make sure that I&#x27;m not putting in an illegal in-law&quot;.  Meanwhile, there are illegal in-laws left and right, all done with zero permits, and no apparent enforcement.  Here&#x27;s the thing, I don&#x27;t have contempt for the law.  I think that a structural engineer and licensed electrical work with required firewalls to prevent an inferno that starts in the illegal in-law from spreading next door are actually pretty good regulations.<p>It sounds like SF may soon allow legal airbnb with some restrictions, but like permits, this will probably be an option to register, pay money, and be regulated vs breaking the law in a nearly zero consequence environment.",1407780701

749171,comment,749155,749162,0,0,nader,,,"I'm positive about Cydia as well as there will be more and more frustrated users and developers turning to the store. Additionally big publications like CNN, Wired and lots of blogs are writing about it.<p>The question is really how long the store will last, or, how long jailbreakers can win against iPhone software updates. Unlikely but maybe Apple finds a way to keep them of doing so.<p>Yes, I think the Android market is interesting as more and more companies are distributing their phones with pre-installed Android, especially in China.",1249728934

This may be the first of her startups to post any revenue, but it's a huge step.<p>All the best of luck, and hopefully you'll be ""post-profit"" soon!",1249728902

749162,comment,749155,749155,0,0,jpcx01,,,"Hopefully Cydia will gain traction. I've bought a couple apps on it already and its been a positive experience.<p>It has the potential to be huge, however no VC firm will touch it since it also has the potential to be sued out of existence. I doubt it will have the resources to build things up enough where it can scale up and get a mainstream marketshare.<p>Android seems to be the only real alternative to Apple's appstore madness. I'll definitely be supporting that platform in the future. Getting an iPhone 3g last year was a really boneheaded move.",1249728308

749157,comment,748843,748985,0,0,jacquesm,,,"One of the major problems with HN is that is is an old, established community. That means that lots of stuff that is new to newcomers is old hat to the old hands here and they do not tire of telling people that.<p>In deference to the 'old hats', they do make this community in to what it is, a place where some pretty cool stuff gets posted and discussed at a fairly high level.<p>I personally see absolutely nothing wrong in people posting stuff that is new to them, for every 'poster' there must be 10's if not 100's of people to who it is news as well.<p>Just because you already know everything there is to know doesn't mean that that goes for everybody else too.<p>One way around this is to have a karma threshold for displaying submissions, that way the 'old hands' if they so choose could blind themselves to whatever the newcomers to on 'their' view of HN without any interference.<p>And it would stop people from taking 'revenge' on the submitter of this story the way it is being done right now, which I really think is not becoming of HN.<p>Have some room for each other please, and do not kick people for doing the same thing that you did yourself in the not so distant past.",1249727367

It's your theorising that suggest as a hypothesis that the lake's current volume is perturbing your measurement - which you then show to be consistent with the rest of your theoretical framework by experiment.<p>I wonder if the bounds are such that someone walking along the corridor will affect the measurement (""yo momma so fat she perturbs the expected measured mass of the Z-boson!""). What's the relative gravitational attraction of, say, Jupiter versus a nearby train.<p>A great insight.",1249725762

You might have a legal name, but they'd need to validate it somehow if contested. Up until now, Google has just been suspending names that didn't look ""real"" to them.<p>2. How do they validate this? Do they expect you to send a copy of an ID? What if you photoshop it? What is their data retention policy? Do they have procedures in place for handling sensitive data?<p>3. Most important, using a legal name does not somehow make the conversation more valid, or more useful. I have yet to see a strong argument that using a name on a government issued ID somehow makes your discourse better. There are countless arguments against this.<p>I've had to deal with this before. Here's an idea of what happens to you if you run afoul of this policy:

The key is that he cared about important things in the context of making and delivering a great product.<p>I've played at a number of Irish Traditional sessions around the country. In one town I lived, there was a very bad drummer who was there every week without fail. No one would say anything out of politeness. After about a half a year, I took it on myself to say something, not in a mean but in a matter of fact way. Her ego was bruised, but on doing that several other musicians immediately thanked me. It seems that everyone there prioritized politeness over the level of musicianship possible, even though they knew it compromised quality.<p>I think it's entirely possible to change one's priorities without being mean or childish, even to the extent of inverting socially accepted priority orderings. Not everyone is going to appreciate what you're doing, but if your heart is in the right place, and you are behaving constructively towards your craft, your customers may well appreciate you.<p>(As much as possible, leave out the childishness.)<p>EDIT: You can also invert this -- let emotional baggage leak into your ""concern for craft"" and your behavior will very much be counted against you.",1343076681

Your assumption that timing attacks are impossible because they are hard to trace seems optimistic, though.<p>This is specifically a security problem.  Saying ""I'll sweep it under the rug"" and considering it solved is historically a bad idea.<p>This chain of ""I'll just do X"", ""no, X isn't enough"", ""then I'll do Y"", ""no, Y isn't enough"", ""then I'll do Z"" are typical of these problems.<p>Unfortunately, each ""I'll just"" is code for ""I'm not going to think through this problem because I think it's easy.""  As with X and Y above, Z is likely to have serious problems.<p>Example problem with the queue approach: hacker puts in lots of password reset requests for his own domain(s) and sees that the queue workers have delays of 0.22 seconds between sending back responses to his domain, with gaps which add 0.37 seconds or 0.22 seconds, to within some error.  Inference: a wrong email takes slightly longer because it often has a retry, and the 0.22 second entries are other correct password reset requests to valid domains.<p>Now he can send back a stream of passwd requests to his domain interspersed with three or four requests to a given email address.  Now he knows if it's valid or not.  (""I'll just block his domain?"" ""He'll use a botnet, he is anyway"" ""I'll just rate-limit password resets!"" ""Good idea - now, do you really believe that that was the last hole in your swiss-cheese security?"")<p>Now you could fix this, too.  But see how we've gone through yet another ""I'll just?""  You can make sure to do the delay in lookup and email sending on each entry in the queue (by the way, you've slowed down all your queue workers and likely increased your hardware costs), but trying to not think about this and sweep it under the rug is really hard.<p>When patio11 says that timing attacks aren't trivial to fix, this is what he means.<p>Is the ""put it in a queue, add a delay to the queue"" method perfect?  That is, is ""I'll just do Z"" the answer?  No.  Having the queue sleep() is less load on other components, which an attacker can check for by pinging other services.  Having it busy-wait is a different load profile than receiving an email.  That's the microsecond-precision thing that patio11 mentions where an attacker can get another instance on the same Rackspace network and measure with a side-channel attack.<p>This is a really hard problem because there are an almost unlimited number of side channels here, and your OS doesn't try to keep information from leaking out on them.",1343076262

I totally disagree with this limitation. I do favor constructor injection and I am always using it with Java based configuration, I never use setter injection (maybe sometimes for optional dependencies). Why should it be a problem that you need an instance for satisfying a dependency? It's only a problem if you have circular dependencies, but then something is wrong with your design.<p>All the rest is flavor we could discuss about for hours without getting to an end, but Spring's Java based configuration definitely doesn't have a problem with constructor injection.<p>Regards,

You do have to develop a certain amount of callousness to pursue your vision. You don't have to scream and berate people, but when you're sending a design back for the tenth time, you're bound to start thinking ""Gosh, this designer is going to think I'm an asshole."" A lot of people will just accept something that's not exactly what they want just to avoid potential bad feelings from someone else.<p>The emotional aspect made it easy and natural for Steve to pursue the design until it was exactly what he wanted.

My experience is with the integration of low cost compute into the flows rather than manufacturing. However I find it striking how similar your argument sounds to the ones that IBM made early on about how PCs would 'never' threaten mainframes because they didn't have the IO capabilities or the printing capability. And while certain markets still use them (credit card processing for example), a lot of things they were used for succumbed to a new way of doing things because it was cheap.<p>I suspect that much of the challenge with CNC penetration is with the costs involved. But could easily be wrong.<p>Current injection molding <i>does</i> make thousands per hour and that's certainly achievable with thousands of 3D printers running in parallel, but the place where I think you will first see disruption will be in the 'short run' segments, where people would make 100,000 parts (minimum run) and only sell 10,000 units. Their price per unit was effectively 10x in that case. But they have no other way to get to 10,000 at the moment. In the compute space that is how the market disrupted, lower performance of the unit offset by the savings of not having to over provision for the compute capacity.

The structure should follow the business functionality, not an arbitrary abstraction that helps the developer talk to the computer. You may end up with 16000 lines of javascript, but if they're spread through 1000 modules that are each clearly related to specific business requirements and/or specific controls in the UI, then as a maintenance developer you'll be able to find the 16 lines you need to worry about for any given task quickly and easily, and then you'll be able to understand those lines once you get to them.",1343074173

There is no bar to attend most hackathons, no qualifying heats or even resume screening.<p>You also assume that lowering the bar inherently attracts less-qualified people than the marginal alternative participant.
That is not true unless the outcome you care about is whatever bar you are using to measure and people accurately self-assess (or universally apply).  
For example, there is a 1992 study that found that SAT scores were equally good at predicting success of women and men, but only within those groups.  Women performed as well during college courses as men with SAT scores 50 points higher (<a href=""http://her.hepg.org/content/1p1555011301r133/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://her.hepg.org/content/1p1555011301r133/</a>).  In such a case in order to maximize total academic performance, you would need to compensate for that systematic discrepancy and lower the SAT bar for women: what you are actually doing is normalizing the predicted-college-performance bar.  That would not maximize total admitted SAT scores, but might maximize the outcome the college actually cares about.",1343073885

In fact, you've increased the number of invariants because you've made it possible for the individual bits to be put together in many different ways, not just the one way that the tightly-coupled code allows. You started with N concerns, and now you have N^2 concerns. That's much worse.<p>It's much riskier too... when your code is decoupled, how can you possibly tell what effect a minor change will have? It's like programming with nothing but global variables. In the tightly-coupled version, you know exactly every single possible code path through your change, and you can ensure that the new behavior will be correct. You just can't do that in the decoupled version, at least not in anywhere close to the same amount of development time/effort.",1343073801

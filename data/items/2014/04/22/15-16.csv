Say that it&#x27;s a necessary side effect of making money with HFT. It&#x27;s an inherent design limitation. The word &quot;bug&quot; implies that it can be fixed, that you can theoretically do HFT at the same speed as you are now without any quote stuffing if only you had perfect code.<p>Let&#x27;s take a vaguely similar example of streaming audio. I worked on a near-realtime streaming audio product for a while so it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m familiar with. Latency and reliability trade off pretty directly. The product I worked on defaulted to a latency of two seconds. This made it pretty robust against network hiccups like wifi interference, but the substantial lag made it annoying or just plain unsuitable for some applications. It was possible to adjust the latency (although this was an advanced technique to the extent that we hid the setting pretty thoroughly) and you could get it down to a fraction of a second and still have the system work overall, but it would be <i>much</i> more prone to dropouts due to network problems.<p>Now, there are some things that could be done to improve this problem absolutely, like adding forward error correction to the protocol, but nothing is going to eliminate the tradeoff entirely. Because of that, I&#x27;d never describe it as a bug. If someone complained about the latency, I told them that it was an unfortunate but necessary consequence of ensuring reliability. The latency can be eliminated easily, but at the cost of less reliability.<p>Likewise here, quote stuffing is an unfortunate but necessary consequence of HFTs. It could be lessened or eliminated by making HFTs less HF, but you don&#x27;t want to do that, because you feel that the Hest possible F is more important. I call the writing weaselly because it portrays quote stuffing as completely unavoidable, but the real scenario is that quote stuffing is completely avoidable, it&#x27;s just that you prefer to make more money instead of stopping it.",1398182377

I&#x27;m just finishing my static site generator that comes with a built-in, drag and droppable CMS. I asked for some feedback a couple weeks ago in the &quot;Help Me Out&quot; posts and ended up making a proper intro video for it as well as releasing our documentation.<p>I&#x27;m taking the product to Kickstarter to drum up my first month of sales and keep the project completely bootstrapped.

Really impressed with firebase as a realtime data store.<p>I&#x27;m also happy to answer any questions about launching something like this on Kickstarter if anyone has any questions for their own projects. Outside of the funding, we mainly did it to have a rough idea of how much infrastructure to build for our first few months.<p>As to the domain, which I&#x27;m sure people will have questions about... we originally had some ideas for incorporating a bunch of webhooks into the CMS that would generate auto-deploys based upon actions from other services.

By a <i>wide</i> margin. Some random website I can give a unique email and password, so if they do bad things, the damage is limited. I wildcard all the smail at my domain to the same place, so if I see spam addressed to e.g. &quot;airbnb.domain@mydomain.net&#x27; I know who sold the address to spammers and have an easy regex to filter on, if necessary.<p>With google/etc, I wouldn&#x27;t have that kind of granularity.

Ironically the answer I got was not even related remotely to software in any way.<p>The thing he told me was that in all his experience, working with awesome people he found that &quot;working things on paper&quot;, gave massive clarity in most projects. Human minds are not great at visualizing large stacks, diagrams and lists. Hence writing down things, simplifies things. In fact when you write things down. Draw that diagram, talk to yourself and refine your ideas on paper in a couple of iterations. You largely solve that problem of reuse, variable naming, problem identification. Agreed that some things demand you play with code a little to proceed further. Yet, planning on paper solves most problems which programmers face today.<p>Agile fashion unfortunately glorified many bad practices.<p>The more I pondered over that though the more I realized, how many bad practices came into software development with this quick development-deployment methodology. In the days of the past while you worked out some documentation before you started a project, you often probed, visualized and solved problems on paper.

And yet I don&#x27;t think I fall into the negative stereotypes he mentions... I guess that explains my reaction (not to mention the self-quoting of tweets).<p>My biggest problem with software development as a profession is that people don&#x27;t think before they do it. I&#x27;ve found that a lot of people just hack away randomly with some code that approximates their idea of how it should work. It usually doesn&#x27;t work, so they just change things aimlessly until it appears to. I can definitely understand this mentality, I&#x27;ve been there--it happens to me when I&#x27;m programming beyond my understanding. But I try very hard to recognize when this happens, and stop to think more. There&#x27;s very little value in writing code that even the author doesn&#x27;t understand. Accumulate enough of this code, and you get the typical horribly-designed patchwork mess that nobody can read, debug, or change.<p>To me, the ability to solve problems that you&#x27;re not familiar with is paramount in importance for actual software engineering. If you&#x27;re just building some CRUDdy business app that does nothing remotely complicated, OK. But bubble sorts and link shorteners? Come on, that stuff is simple. Maybe you never need to implement those specific examples, but as a placeholder for general problem-solving skill, it&#x27;s a low bar.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s why the title refers to &quot;software developer&quot; rather than &quot;software engineer&quot;.

Generally, firms that are smart avoid moving their prices around &quot;too much&quot; since:<p>a.) You lose your spot in the queue. If I am near the front of the price/time queue buying at 100.01 and move to 100.00 and back up again, now I&#x27;m behind everyone else and will either lose opportunity or face more negative selection (I&#x27;ll only trade when someone wants to sell all the contracts bid at 100.01, whereas before I would get some trades where someone only wants to sell a few).<p>b.) Sending orders is more computationally expensive than doing nothing. If you send enough orders you will slow down your own system.<p>c.) Depending on market rules and behavior the messages you send may cause your gateway to queue up or block you from sending more messages which hurts you.<p>I don&#x27;t think quote flicker can provide any &quot;evil&quot; benefit to the person doing it. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to do it to slow down competitors, since most feeds are multicasted to everyone and you still have to process all the orders you send, both from the gateway and over the data feed. If you are faster at handling this situation than your competition then you are going to beat them anyway so what&#x27;s the benefit in slowing them down?<p>I do think it can be disruptive in the sense that it places extra load on the exchange and can annoy participants who have trouble taking prices on their screen. Some markets have quote/trade rules to encourage more efficient messaging which is their right and not a bad idea if the limits are set reasonably. Rules like this make more sense than a minimum resting time, which just penalizes makers at the expense of fast takers. Imagine I am putting quotes out in SPY, an S&P 500 ETF, but they need to rest for half a second. Someone sees the S&P 500 futures or the individual stocks move and then my quote becomes a free option to trade at an unfair price. In a market like this, market makers would be forced to put up wider prices to compensate for these losses.<p>A high quote/trade ratio in itself is not disruptive. A lot of the Nanex charts use thinly traded derivative products like ETFs as their whipping boy. The underlying value of these products will change whenever another stock or commodity changes, so market makers need to update their quotes quite rapidly to avoid trading at unfair prices, even if no trades have occurred in the product itself.",1398180667

As a citizen of where I live, I&#x27;m upset at them breaking the law--or, more specifically, condoning and aiding breaking the law[0]--and not only expecting not to have any consequences for that but going so far as to be furious when there are consequences.<p>The actions of UberX and Lyft in Seattle over the &quot;ridesharing&quot; debate have been demonstrative.  I&#x27;ll say upfront that the Seattle City Council&#x27;s idea to cap Transportation Network Company (TNC) drivers to 150 per TNC seems shortsighted, but I can understand why[1].  When Lyft and UberX didn&#x27;t get exactly what they wanted, they filed and paid for signature gathering to put the ordinance to a referendum; their right to do so under law.  However, that referendum suspends the ordinance that makes their business model legal.  Instead of ceasing, both companies doubled-down.  Why do they get to break the law in the name of &quot;disruption&quot; when most of the rest of us don&#x27;t?<p>0 - For-hire drivers have to meet certain requirements that Lyft and UberX drivers don&#x27;t meet.  Further, both companies actively solicit for people to violate the terms of their auto insurance.  Being canceled &quot;for cause&quot; by an auto insurer is an almost guaranteed way to see a person&#x27;s rates double with the next company.<p>1 - I can think of two reasons.  First, it&#x27;s because taxis are capped and, while that system is badly broken, it can&#x27;t just be yanked out from under the existing taxi system.  That leads to the second reason, which is the Council not wanting to have hundreds or thousands of cars trying to cruise the same areas while looking for passengers.",1398180009

People who can&#x27;t justify their own salaries in an open-allocation environment (noting that a typical engineer is worth 3-5x under closed allocation and 10-20x in open allocation) are those you shouldn&#x27;t be hiring anyway.<p>Often, brilliant, high-variance people are binary (or, at least, sporadic) in output, not because they have an attitude problem, but because they&#x27;re neurologically built that way. Environments that favor (or, even, demand) reliable mediocrity shut them down and lose the ability to hit the high notes.<p>The best way to work with such people is to give them an R&D environment where they direct their own work and career. They know what they&#x27;re doing, and they make more of a profit with the hits than they lose on the misses.

HFTs need to filter their own orders out of the orderbook they are trading on, or a feedback loop can begin.

About a month ago, My partner James and I launched a website called Sproutr that has some very big plans for making collaboration and exposure much easier when starting a business. We actually want to streamline the process starting right at the idea phase.<p>Inspired by communities like this and concepts like collaborative consumption and social physics, we have a dream for anyone to be able to simply post an idea, and enter a process that will help you grow your team, design a strategy and collaborate with a global community of entrepreneurs.<p>We built a beta that is currently focused around community discussions, the ability to search users by their skills and get in contact with them. We will soon begin building a system that will allow you to share your idea with the community, and Sproutr will suggest people in the community to ask for input as well as people who would be perfect to join your team (potentially around the world).<p>Up until this point user growth has not been a focus. Our core concern has been building a product that is both functional and valuable to the user. Sproutr has been live for just a short period of time and the results and feedback have both been great. We&#x27;re now at a point where we want to grow our user base by about 500-1000 in the next month. We want to accomplish this with two major constraints: - Zero-to-minimal marketing/advertising spend. - We want to remain on schedule with our product backlog. That means production cannot slow down, and there is only 2 of us right now.<p>I know there are entrepreneurs here who would have some good ideas/input/opinions on how to make this growth happen. If you could share your experience and wisdom below it would benefit us a ton.<p>If you want to take a look at the beta and maybe give us some input, the url is https://sproutr.co<p>Thanks for reading this, and please let us know if you have any good advice!",1398179175

Employment rights and social welfare in the UK is a joke compared to in Norway - the UK is &quot;US light&quot; in those respects.<p>Yet I felt I had much more freedom of choice in Norway: Becoming truly destitute in Norway is pretty much only possible if you refuse to apply for government support.<p>This, to me, meant I was free to make a lot of decisions without considering consequences that would put me at substantial risk in the UK, and much more so in the US. It is hard to describe the feeling. I&#x27;ve mentioned before, how I started my first company (an ISP) pretty much on a whim because we were dissatisfied with the available ISPs; we threw together a business plan, found an angel investor, found offices and moved into them (literally; three of us lived there for a while) in the span of a few months. During this time, <i>not once</i> did the potential consequences of failing enter my mind, for the simple reason that there&#x27;d pretty much not be any consequences: I&#x27;d be able to get government support if I needed it, and I&#x27;d &quot;just&quot; go back to my studies or find another job.<p>Not really needing to worry about healthcare, or housing, or whether or not you might starve, are important forms of freedom to me. I&#x27;d take that over a few percent lower taxes any day, and I&#x27;d argue that I get more freedom of choice from those benefits than what few percent more disposable income could buy me in other ways.<p>> About a third of his wages (and 20% of everything he buys) is used for the different types of government support.<p>If Francois makes enough to pay 1/3 of his wages in income taxes, he&#x27;s earning enough that he&#x27;d pay roughly 1/3 of his wages in taxes in many pats of the US too. Sure, if Francois went to live in Utah, he&#x27;d be better off, tax wise. If he were to go to California, on the other hand, the difference would be minimal.<p>VAT makes up very little of the typical tax burden. I&#x27;m in the UK, and 20% VAT translates to about 4% of my gross wage, because most of my income does not go to products that are taxed at the 20% bracket (for starters, I pay tax with some of them; then I pay my mortgage, and so on; and food is zero-rated).<p>Tax differences are not as great as people tend to think. My tax burden in Norway was about 1-2 percentage points higher than in the UK. A salary giving me the same purchasing power in Silicon Valley, would cut my tax bill by about the same as my added costs for healthcare insurance, and certainly wouldn&#x27;t cover my increased transport costs... I did the maths for this to excruciating detail because we were considering moving to the US at one point. There may be specific income levels where the differences are more pronounced due to differences in tax policies, and certainly some countries / states are more or less expensive (as I learned the other day: stay clear of Belgium... )",1398178907

This is to discourage taking a lot of time to create creative videos. Raw is key.",1398178822

I totally understand your point, and this is the idea behind VisualOps: you need to deal with complicated tools if you want to get total control (eg. Chef with OpsWorks), or you need to make some concessions if you want something easy (eg. PaaS platforms like Heroku).<p>With VisualOps, you have a total control of your instances software configuration, as well as the &quot;hardware&quot;/&quot;network&quot; specifications available by AWS.<p>>Complicated data format Even if someone hacked into our servers, took a copy of the data, stole our source code or laptop, they still cannot get your information.<p>I think there is a confusion there. What we meant is that the AWS credentials are store on specific servers, which are not accessible by the employees here. These credentials aren&#x27;t accessible using data stored on employees computers or internal git repos\nThanks for telling us, we will modify this sentence, and sorry for the confusion.",1398178815

I have no problem with them using ads to pay for content, but when subscriptions or similar become required to view content not purposely made annoying to view is another thing. Either present it properly or lock me out. Don&#x27;t go half way and make the experience annoying.<p>Annoying means I start playing with css and add ons to fix your site so I can view it if you even worth the time by then",1398178809

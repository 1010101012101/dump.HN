6548349,comment,6547089,6548093,4,0,VLM,,,"My son has medically diagnosed gluten sensitivity or whatever Celiac is officially called, and he loves the recent fad because there&#x27;s tons of junk food he can buy at the store, at least as long as the fad lasts.  He was diagnosed many years ago and back then, there were not many artificial GF products out there to buy...<p>It would be interesting to compare results over time, my son was diagnosed quite awhile ago and it was cheap and easy to go cold turkey WRT grains, whereas I think paradoxically it might be harder today for people recently (self?) diagnosed because there so many &quot;here&#x27;s a GF sorta-cookie-like object for a mere $6.95&quot; products in stores.  Or the GF pancake mix that tastes good even to me, but is about $10/box.  Its a lot cheaper, and arguably easier, to eat naturally GF products than artificially GF products, what I&#x27;m getting at is its a lot cheaper and easier to make a GF omelet for breakfast than to go thru what you need to do to make (or buy) GF french toast.  Its easier and cheaper to make your own taco meat seasoning than to try and buy a packaged envelope that doesn&#x27;t use wheat flour as a thickener, for example.",1381769981

Often, I think this mentality is more a matter of being mindful about how the work you&#x27;re doing is impacting your marketability and future prospects.  Also, I find this mentality to be a good way of motivating myself when I&#x27;m getting organized and grinding through projects - I take note of anything new I&#x27;m doing that might be relevant to other employers and note the value of being the kind of employee that can run through these things quickly.<p>Admittedly, it would be harder to have this mentality if you&#x27;re set on staying with a company for 5+ years, but even then, shouldn&#x27;t you be looking at other employers for salary negotiations?  Shouldn&#x27;t you be looking at potential advancement opportunities within your department/company?",1381769915

It seems that from the perspective of those\n   paying us, Beeminder is providing a ton of value and a \n   ton of motivation and the occasional cost of derailment \n   is a fair fee for Beeminders service...&quot;\n\n  &quot;in other words, Beeminder is putting itself on the map \n   for exactly one reason: it makes people more awesome.\n\n   But that can lead to the opposite complaint  that \n   Beeminders sting is so valuable as to be \n   self-defeating. In other words, its hard to be \n   motivated by the threat of having to pay Beeminder if \n   you feel that Beeminder has already earned that money!&quot;\n</code></pre>\n... Ok that only serves to scare me more.<p>This is a nasty psychological game beeminder is playing. So is GymPact. When people feel they have failed or they are at fault, a part of them wants to provide recompense for that failure. Beeminder and GymPact are not the first to fit this business model. Cable companies do it with wildly obtuse rules, ugly restriction, and massive overcharge fees, all with the line &quot;Well it was your fault, it&#x27;s written in the rules right here!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what I see to be the problem. Beeminder puts itself resolutely in place as the &#x27;go to&#x27; to seek punishment, striking where humans are at their weakest. Of course, rather than hail Marys, the punishment is money.<p>The fact is, because beeminder makes its money through my failure, it has a monetary insensitive to bring about that failure by any means, real or perceived. <a href=""http://darkpatterns.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darkpatterns.org/</a> exists for exactly this reason! On what grounds do I have to believe beeminder would be immune to such an influence? Because beeminder loves me and wants me to get better?<p>That is how I saw it, from the outside looking in. I liked the idea, I really did, but with beeminder standing to benefit from the pledge, rather than say, a charity of some kind, I could never trust them.",1381769876

Some researchers in industry are given fairly wide latitude in the topics that they are allowed to study.

For such researchers, their indirect value is the publications and resulting press that hopefully increases the brand of the corporation in a more general sense.<p>I think it&#x27;s a fair trade off to have to make if you&#x27;re considering industrial research.

He cannot do more than $4 of environmental damage and still stay in business.  Even if brats magically fell from the sky for free, he simply can&#x27;t do worse than stack up $4 worth of lead and old car tires and set them on fire or whatever other environmental degradation you can imagine.<p>The good organic farmers market meat costs more than $4/lb but less than $10 so the argument still holds.  In fact I&#x27;m about to take delivery of a quarter-cow from a local organic farmer, got my high efficiency freezer all defrosted and emptied and ready to fill with delicious organic local grass fed beef.<p>On the other hand, the guy who I just handed a $10 to for a pound of quinoa can stack of $10 worth of old car tires and set them on fire and dump $10 of antifreeze into the river or WTF.  He can afford to &quot;ruin the environment&quot; to the tune of $9.99 and still stay in business, unlike the brat guy above who would go almost instantly out of business if he spent $9 trashing the environment for every $4 incoming.<p>This is before I even get started on the supply side, where for the sake of argument lets say I have to kill one baby seals per $1 take home pay.  That means to earn the $10 for quinoa regardless of how &quot;pure&quot; his quinoa growing operation is, ten baby seals died, whereas to earn the $4 for brats, regardless of how &quot;pure&quot; his pig sty is, a mere four baby seals had to die.  I would argue that most people in the real world work at pretty ugly companies, ecologically speaking, so most of the enviro damage comes from earning the money rather than how its spent.  Another example is I burn about a gallon of gas per day that I drive to work, so even if I do the ultimate green thing and finance planting a rainforest or something, I&#x27;ve still ecologically destroyed a gallon of gas before I even crack open my wallet.<p>There are some interesting petroleum arguments also, in that a pound of &quot;meat&quot; from the organic farmer five miles away at the farmers market burned a heck of a lot less diesel / bunker fuel than a pound of quinoa from another hemisphere.  Although a small timer grew and sold a little native quinoa at the market which I bought, reality is that the vast majority of it is imported from another hemisphere at substantial cost.<p>I can buy locally grown organic beef, pork, and chicken.  Most people can&#x27;t buy locally grown quinoa.  Some people can, and American&#x27;s are literally starving them out of the local quinoa market, which is too bad.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a hard core environmentalist at heart for example I think people who dump industrial waste into rivers I hike by should be capital punished by being forced to drink what they dumped till they croak, its only fair since the poor bastards living downstream are already literally drinking it...  But feel good irrational non-analyzed environmentalism does more bad for the earth than good, and it turns out the reality is that everyone&#x27;s better off if I eat a quarter pound steak rather than a quarter pound of quinoa, under existing conditions.",1381767880

Again, you&#x27;d have to suffer losing over half your capital before you eventually came out on top.</i><p>You seem to be ignoring dividends.<p>The S&P 500 gave a total return of 11% nominal and 4.5% real from the high point in 1973 to the low point in 1992.  (Note: I only have monthly figures for the 1970s.)<p><pre><code>  SPXTR, Jan 31, 1973: 60.27\n  CPI-U, Jan 1973: 42.6\n\n  SPXTR, April 8, 1992: 457.16\n  CPI-U, April 1992: 139.5\n\n  Total nominal return: 457.16 / 60.27 = 7.59\n  Annual nominal return: 7.59 ^ (1/19) = 1.11\n\n  Total real return: 457.16 / 139.5 / 60.27 * 42.6 = 2.32\n  Annual real return = 2.32 ^ (1/19) = 1.045\n</code></pre>\nHistorically, dividends have accounted for over half the return, and thus you cannot simply ignore them.  This is why I use the S&P 500 Total Return Index (SPXTR) to calculate returns, not the S&P 500 Index (SPX).<p>Note: Taxes not included in the calculation.  Alternative investments, such as bonds and money market funds, would&#x27;ve been taxed as well.  You could&#x27;ve gotten tax-deferred compounding starting in 1975, when the Traditional IRA was created.<p>Data sources:<p>1. GlobalFinancialData.com for SPXTR, extended backwards.

There are already many alternatives already out there to WP. Most of them as light as this product is, there for already filling the gap for something bare bones. Yet, people make that personal choice to use WP, in their millions.<p>One big reason people would go for feature rich WP is future proofing. Would be a bit of a mare to use this, then discover you needed more features in the future and have to ditch it for WP, or similar. On top of that the massive user base gives rise to a massive amount of support knowledge. Always a comfort.<p>Finally, I have to say, if a hacker type in the web business wants something bare bones, what one earth is one doing with blogging software at all? Surely bare bones would be straight HTML with a sniff of CSS? Don&#x27;t even need a database, and let evil google do the searching. In is most basic form, blogs are just blocks of text linked up. Im pretty sure most people here could rattle up a serviceable blog site in less than a day. I know I could, and I&#x27;m crap.<p>You know, well done to the people who did the work and what not, but Im not seeing any massive positive reason to use it over WP. In fact, in some ways I see it as a risk. What if I want to expand in the future, and this simply cant have the same level of support information. Which is a shame.",1381766867

6547997,comment,6543892,6546612,1,0,mjn,,,"Denmark has several EU opt-outs in its accession treaty. Equal treatment of non-resident non-nationals for the purposes of property ownership is one of them, mostly because they were worried about Germans buying up all the summer homes (joining the Euro and joining the European military command are two others). I believe Malta has the same opt-out, and Finland had a temporary one that&#x27;s being phased out.<p>However the coops are where the residency catch-22 hits most often, and those are just structured with contract law. They have the typical owner-occupied-only rules that most coops worldwide have (some NYC coops are similar). When you buy a coop share you sign a contract agreeing that you, the share owner, are buying the coop share because you plan to reside there. You agree in the contract not to sublet it, and to sell your share if in the future you no longer reside there (usually with a 2-year grace period).<p>What&#x27;s different from the U.S. is that it&#x27;s fairly easy for the coop to enforce the owner-occupied requirement, because there is a central register of residence addresses. Every person resident in Denmark declares themselves legally resident at exactly one address. So the coop can trivially check if you have declared yourself resident at the coop or not. If you move out of the country, then to avoid Danish taxes you must declare yourself a nonresident, which removes you from the register, which the coop then sees. It also means that you can&#x27;t own shares in two coops, since you can&#x27;t register yourself at both. (Though in either case, some games can be played by spouses.)<p>The nonprofit housing associations are just regular landlords, who own large parts of the city and rent out, again with no-subletting contracts.",1381766622

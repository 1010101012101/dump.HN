3768045,comment,3767019,3767019,7,0,tokenadult,,,"Like a lot of people here, I have sporadically read Wikipedia for years. I came on board as a Wikipedia editor in May 2010 after meeting the project's co-founder and his family in person the year before. I've since seen some of those immediate family members on another lengthy occasion. My children regularly interact with that family in an online education community. Through a web of mutual friendships, I thought I had some sense of what the community norms would be like on Wikipedia before I started. Moreover, I began editing only after reading the several published books about Wikipedia available at that time (as disclosed on my Wikipedia user page), and came on board as someone who has actually had both academic journal editing positions and paid journalism editing positions before Wikipedia even existed.<p>Even at that, I get a lot of well sourced edits reverted by ideologically motivated drive-by I.P. editors as part of an ongoing process of edit-warring on articles that I happen to know sources for.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/...</a><p>For some controversial topics, no amount of good-faith editing by editors who actually know how to look up reliable sources and how to have civil discussions of controversial issues can overcome the flood of point-of-view pushers (both I.P. editors and registered editors who are sock puppets or meat puppets of previously banned editors) who want to drag down the project to below the level of a partisan blog. There simply isn't any incentive in today's atmosphere on Wikipedia for readers who actually know what encyclopedias look like and who have actually engaged in careful research on controversial topics to devote any of their time and effort to Wikipedia.<p>My number of edits per month has plummeted, and mostly I wikignome to clean up copyediting mistakes on miscellaneous articles written by young people or foreign nationals who didn't write grammatical English in the last revision of the article. The way to increase participation by productive, knowledgeable, literate editors is to drive away the ideologues and enforce some reasonable behavioral norms on article talk pages and user talk pages. I see no sign of that happening over at Wikipedia, and until I do, I will heartily support anyone's effort to build a competing resource, either limited to a specialized topic or a direct attempt to build a better quality general online encyclopedia.<p>I think the ""Lamest Edit Wars"" page in project space sums up much of what is amiss about Wikipedia.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars</a>",1332964498

3768042,comment,3765717,3767890,17,0,pndmnm,,,"Batista is not being downvoted because they're expressing a differing opinion.  They're being downvoted because they're not taking the time to fully consider the issues and engage in reasonable debate.<p>As an example, from their first post, they suggest that it's not legitimate to worry about this sort of problem because larger problems exist.  This form of argument is not only blindly hypocritical (that is, if the arguer believed it, they would not be engaging in the subdebate but rather be working to resolve the larger problem) but intrinsically ridiculous -- it supposes that it's not legitimate to discuss any issue while ""worse"" problems persist.  It's a self-defeating argument on a specialized forum like HN, and utilizing it indicates that someone isn't actually arguing the topic at hand (in a sense, it's a ""universal"" argument, and thus like nonfalsifiable theories, completely irrelevant).<p>They then literally compare their own downvoting to the Salem witch trials (the irony of which is beyond belief, and further calls into question their sincerity), and additionally claim that proportion of women in tech is ""not a serious issue in its manifestation or it's consequences at all"", and when pressed that many people disagree, compare people who care about workplace sexism to hypochondriacs in order to marginalize their beliefs (this is particularly poisonous and a clear indicator that they're not interested in the viewpoints of others).  They also fall into a really standard ""I'm just expressing my opinion"" backtrack, which is particularly ironic given that their initial complaint was that people were expressing their opinion on this topic rather than doing something more worthwhile.<p>Regardless of their viewpoint, they're not participating in reasonable intellectual discourse.  We're not obligated to argue with someone who's plainly not interested in having an actual argument, and the up/down-voting is working as it should in this instance (I'm certainly not saying it works as it should in all instances, but this is pretty clear).",1332964424

For example, a county with only 150 people in it might be the target of a group of libertarians.  800 libertarians may agree to move there to set up a libertarian government.  The point the book made was that <i>virtually uninhabited</i> is very different than <i>uninhabited</i>, and that there are still people there who have wishes, dreams and rights of their own.<p>So what you are describing is actually an act of force.  Overtaking Nauru for your own purposes is a unilateral destruction of someone's home.  Imagine for some odd reason the entire population of China decided to buy out and relocate to your city and turn it into a Chinese culture and economy.

And I think if you distilled all of these posts down to their essence, you'd have a really solid critique and we could build some lessons learned, and the next time someone gets burned by a bad implementation of s/Agile|XP|Scrum/ maybe the narrative will change a bit from ""Agile sucks"" to something more productive, something closer to ""there's that Agile execution thing again, and here's what I did about it.""<p>Everything OP says is true, Agile is misapplied, overmarketed and badly executed, and much suffering in the name of ""Agile"" has happened.<p>But we need to change the story now. This same cycle of ""sucks"" -> ""yeah but"" is generating more heat than light. Time to reset and redirect our expectations to something productive.<p>""In time there will be a new movement which paints Agile as broken, inefficient and bad and we’ll get a new brand.  That’s the kind of iterative development I’m looking forward to; a new target for our collective disdain ;)""<p>Here we've hit on something. On common refrain in anti-Agile screeds is ""Meet the new boss, same as the old boss."" And it's true, but instead of cynically setting us up for some other jaded iteration of Good Process Idea -> Marketing Scam/Bad Implementation -> Backlash, let's distill the lessons learned into something a little more focused and circumspect.<p>Let's not cycle through this again, please. Let's set Agile in its proper place, good stuff, bad stuff, the whole thing. And let's tell the right story that might help us stop looking to things like Agile as the One Best Way to do software and see it as the limited tool it is, dependent on many other concerns, such as quality of developer, product focus, political environment, etc. Agile was a great insight in its time, and I think the time is come for a large-scale retrospective by the community to state the lessons learned.<p>One iteration I would really like to see end is ""Agile Sucks"" -> ""But Not Really"".

For example six or seven years ago if you wrote something that was true but unsourced, or else the citation was formatted incorrectly, the text would generally be left up and a higher level editor would get around to hunting down the proper citation eventually. But today these kind of edits would get instantly reverted, even though they create value. The issue is that because so much of Wikipedia is already properly cited, adding new text that is correct but not properly cited temporarily lowers the overall quality of the encyclopedia even though it would ultimately create value if left up and fixed, so essentially what we have now is one of those game theory failures.<p>This really isn't that hard to figure out and all they'd have to do is slightly tweak the design to fix it, so I don't really see why they're having so much trouble on this one.",1332961531

You don't even <i>need</i> to be very good to succeed in such a scenario.<p>Cowboy programmers are those who extrapolate from that and believe that teams efforts can work the same way, and who think that process causes only inefficiencies rather than preventing much larger ones.<p>But for a team to work effectively, you need structure, you need process. Even if the team members are very good, they can get completely lost without process. If they are not completely antisocial, they will come up with some sort of process themselves, but it's not automatically going to be a very effective one (and that has nothing to do with their programming skills). The point of agile is to try and <i>minimize</i> process while still enabling teams to work effectively. And it has absolutely nothing to do with ""eschewing individual thought"". Quite exactly the opposite, really. But of course there's no concept that can can't be perverted into its opposite by a sufficiently point-haired idiot.",1332961400

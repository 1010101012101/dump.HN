174074,comment,173830,173938,0,0,soundsop,,,"<i>the fact that apple machines used to have a totally different architecture than PCs felt right, in a psychological way. it drew a clear line in the sand between Us and Them. now that apple machines are pretty much the same under the hood as PCs ... it's sad.</i><p>I'm a bit of an Apple fanboy myself, but I simply don't get this attitude. I want the best processor in my machines. I admit that I have an emotional attachment to my personal computers, but it somehow does not encompass the brand of processor (or hard drive, graphics chip, etc.).",1209170085
174073,comment,173830,173851,0,0,soundsop,,,"<i>Apple will probably start making their own chips for the iPhone and their new gadgets but I doubt they will do the same for the PC market.</i><p>Agreed. I am an electrical engineer (circuit designer) and Intel is a monster when it comes to fabricating processors (their fabs are super optimized for processors alone, unlike generic fabs). I don't think Apple could do much better costwise by designing and manufacturing their own processers rather than buying Intel (even factoring in Intel's profits). This assumes that AMD continues to exist as competition.<p>Everyone in the circuits industry is very interested in how Apple will use PA Semi's processors.",1209169847

174062,comment,173935,173964,0,0,Bluem00,,,"Here's an idea to reward high quality posts in a way robust to karma inflation: You could change the criteria for a follow/nofollow decision to use the time a link spends on the front page (e.g. the top 30). High scoring posts stay there for a while, while low scoring posts will drop off quickly.<p>A similar approach could be used to dynamically set the karma barrier, if you don't want to track the rank of individual posts.",1209168885

I think modern textbooks spend a lot of pages showing fluff. When I look at historical books, like Hardy's A Course on Pure Mathematics, I am amazed at how concise yet rigorous they are compared with today's textbooks.",1209168851

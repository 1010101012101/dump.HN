I know there are at least 2 or 3 other Plan 9 users on this site, and they help try to clear up some of the questions.<p>I've done quite a bit of poking around in Plan 9, but of course I don't know all of it. I've hacked in the kernel and worked on the 64-bit version as well, I've fooled with the compilers, and I've hacked on the window manager.<p>If anyone wants to ask questions about some aspect of Plan 9, I'll do my best to answer--and if I can't, I bet others can jump in and take over. It would be great to clear up some of the misconceptions, myths, and FUD!",1345226394
4397781,comment,4396931,4396931,5,0,wbizzle,,,"This article is incredibly misleading. First of all there is an inconsistency. The headline says they stored 700 terrabytes (4.4 petabytes). It then later says that they actually stored 700 kilobytes (Their book) and that they did made 70 billion copies (44 petabytes?). The main thing is that storing 700 kilobytes and then making 700 billion copies is considerably less useful than storing 70 billion terabytes outright. Aside from that though, this is awesome, and a huge step forward into promising and uncharted territory.",1345226356

4397776,comment,4395014,4395812,1,0,to3m,,,"You could use it to automatically get firmware and software updates. One likely way of doing it: use git to list out tags and branches, find most recent one with appropriate text in the name. Then check out the data from that revision, and use it. Maybe delete the local git stuff afterwards (since you don't need it any more). Or, better yet, archive the data from that revision.<p>You might not necessarily supply this solution as part of a product - but if you work somewhere that has a lot of devices to manage, you might want to do this kind of thing yourself, internally. And if you're going to then take it seriously, you'd want to keep previous revisions of all your stuff around, making it easy for you to roll back to previous versions. Files with history, and easy rolling back to previous revisions... git isn't the worst possible way of doing that.<p>(I've seen this sort of thing done with perforce, pretty much exactly as I describe, to deliver updates of internal tools and manage test builds of products. Daily builds of tools and products get checked in to perforce each day; most days, QA test that day's build results; if a a given day's build proves not to be a big pile of crap, they tag the corresponding revision. Then you can use perforce to find half-decent historical builds, and retrieve them. The place I saw this done at had a little tool that somebody had written to put a friendly GUI face on this process.)",1345226320

You can see this in extreme form on some forums like Kuroshin (remember that?) which have been abandoned to the trolls and are now overrun.<p>The problem with most systems to control quality is defining what is good, and what is not good. That's not a simple problem and I'm not convinced you'd ever be able to get a crowd to decide on it satisfactorily - there's a reason that mass-entertainment panders to the lowest common denominator, and a crowd's votes are likely to trend the same way and any automated system is subject to gaming and the ignorance of crowds as soon as you let a lot of people have input, however small. 
Another solution used by sites like reddit or stackoverflow is to segment the communities into small enough groups to be self-policing.<p>Another approach I wondered about recently was along the lines of 'A plan for Spam' - it'd be interesting to use the massive comment base of HN to build up some sort of corpus of good and bad comments and apply Bayesian filtering to comments. You could use this to:<p>Set an initial point score for comments based on their content<p>Weight comment votes from users who consistently scored highly<p>You would have to seed the corpus of course, and let it learn from trusted users' votes, but otherwise this sort of system would in theory continue to work as long as there were enough good comments being posted.",1345226263

As was stated in the original post, purchasing software is often done blindly and is a total gamble. Given that the brand of most software is worthless and the cost of production is nothing, where does the value of that software come from?<p>2) Granted, there are some arbitrary restriction on cars, but they are still a lot more open than software. You can easily alter them, fix them yourself, etc. None of that is remotely possible with commercially-distributed software. I can't just fork Tweetbot, add in support for Orkut, and redownload it to my phone.  However, if I want to install a better radio into my car I can. Software (especially on mobile) exists as an immutable ""black box"" that you have no access to other than the user interface, and that makes it less valuable.<p>3) No one is arguing that it is inherently wrong to charge for software. People refuse to pay not because they are principally opposed to it, but because the average price of an app in the app store is far below $.99, and thus $.99 seems like an inflated price.<p>4) It's true that apps like Photoshop are valuable, but it's apparent that their prices are absurdly inflated. Pixelmator can make an app with 90% of the functionality at a little over 2% of the price.  Is that 10% extra functionality really worth all those hundreds of dollars? For most, it isn't. The same can be said of apps. Sure, that $.99 app is cool, but this free one does 90% of what the paid one does. Is that 10% extra functionality really worth all those dozens of pennies?

You're not so much buying the individual drink as buying into Starbucks. You've made your evaluation, considered the options, and settled on a product for which you are going to shell out a pile of cash, using it for a long time (in $4 20oz increments). This vs. apps which, as you note, requires evaluation every time with a different experience for each $1. The ""coffee vs. app"" comparison would only be valid if every time you bought a drink you weren't quite sure what you were getting, knowing that there was high odds of chucking it on the first sip; you wouldn't be buying many of those either. The coffee analogy matches more the device you're running the app on: same device, used in small increments daily, with a little surface variation (the apps), for a very long time; this matching more that you're buying the Starbucks experience for $2 a day, and swapping out toppings/flavorings (apps) for another $1 or so.<p>BTW: the correct order is ""short black"".

4397565,comment,4393817,4393817,1,0,bicknergseng,,,"I'm having a hard time finding a part of this post that I agree with.  I understand and also think there is a problem making an apples to apples comparison of digital and real goods, but let me step through these arguments:<p>""Fact: Starbucks Coffee is a Trustable Experience""<p>So the argument here is that brand weight translates into actual value.  While this is true across the consumerist landscape, there now also exists these things called reviews.  They enable people with no knowledge of something to make a reasonable decision based on the experience of others.  For example, I would be willing to pay more at a well reviewed coffee shop than at a Starbucks.  For me, reviews always trump brand value.<p>""Fact: Your $1 App is a Total Gamble""
First problem: the logic that x was bad so y must be bad as well is flawed.  No one would have Starbucks, hate it, and hate Peet's Coffee by association.  Now, it would be reasonable to assume that someone could be turned off by Apps in general the same way someone could dislike coffee, but that makes this whole argument comparison anyway.  Second: you're making the same mistake arrogant people make when they write off buying a lotto ticket before a big drawing.  Yes, odds of winning might be low (staggeringly low in the lottery, much less so in buying an app), but the potential gain far outweighs it and the barrier to entry is also next to nothing.  You might buy a $1 app and have it be worthless, but it also might give you 30 hours of playtime or speed up your tasks by 10 min a day or something wonderful.  If it's worthless, you're out a dollar. I'll miss that single dollar... I could have travelled back in time to the 80s and bought a candy bar.<p>""Fact: Starbucks Has No Free Alternative""
Yes they do. Taste tests.  But this is harder to argue against, and deserves another debate altogether.  If someone provides a better service/app for free, by all means use it.  It works for open source, less so for people trying to turn a profit.  Expect a paid version to come along that trumps it.<p>""Fact: The Starbucks Craftsmanship Is On Full Display""
Seriously wtf.  ""The feeling says lots of work went into this magical liquid pick-me-up."" And apps grow on trees?  What an ignorant statement.  What do you consider the screenshots and YouTube videos of applications?  Whether you meant to or not, you have managed to say that you think it takes far more work to make the same cup of coffee your home coffee pot makes than it does to build an application.  ""How often have you heard people say I could have made that app, if only Id thought of it first. Or thats so simple, I cant believe its been so successful.""  I don't think I've heard anyone say ""I could have made that,"" it's far more likely to hear ""I thought of that first.""  To that I say, ""If you guys were the inventors of Facebook you'd have invented Facebook.""<p>Yes, perhaps there is a problem with comparing a cup of coffee with a $1 app.  But the problem is not that Starbucks is more valuable than some individual or that a single app developer is to blame for the quality of all software.  The problem is that we have allowed computer science to become a black box in our society.  It's far worse than even math's ""I don't need to know this because I'll never use it."" The only people who have any idea of the time and effort involved in software creation are the people who create software.  You call it ""showing craftsmanship,"" but I call it changing our damn society to stop trivializing things that take massive amounts of effort while glorifying the ones that take little. The solution is simple: make computer science a mainstay of primary and secondary education.  Reading, writing, arithmetic, and computers.<p>TL;DR: The trivialization of the effort involved with software development is the fault of society and not the fault of software developers.",1345224318

The vaccine isn't 100% effective, but a 99% effective vaccine will prevent the disease from spreading around enough that the 1% where it didn't take are still safe.  The unvaccinated, however, still create an infection risk for the 1% who weren't vaccinated successfully.<p>In the same way, the fake security systems will cause increases in the relevancy of the failure rate of real security systems.  Let's say that we have 100 criminals, 100 homes with 98% effective security systems, and 100 homes without.  Currently, the 100 criminals will rob the 100 unsecured homes, because they don't want to take the 98% failure risk.  Now, let's say that the people in the unsecured homes put in fake systems.  The 100 criminals now attack 50 secured homes and 50 pretend secured homes.  The security system stops 98% of the attacks on the secured homes, leaving one of those attacks as successful.  The fifty criminals who attacked the unsecured homes still get away with everything.  Thus, one person who bought a security system is attacked who wouldn't have been attacked if the fake systems weren't in play, so the people with the fake systems have added to the risk of people who own real systems.  However, we have also decreased the number of successful attacks, so I'm not sure that there's reasonable claim of moral wrong-doing in this scenario.<p>Now, my numbers are obviously fictional, but the fake systems will increase the number of successful attacks on real systems.

Before I became a professional writer (for a company, not actually writing books), I was an aspiring musician and, let me tell you, what he says is very accurate for this 'career'.<p>All the bands (or 'projects' as we liked to call them) I've ever been in (more than 10 in the last 15 or so years) thought we could have made it; 'making it' meaning having monetary success or 'living off of music'. All of us failed except one of my ex-band members.<p>The problem is, as the author suggests, it's not really about skill, though there is a level of skill needed to be successful. That level is very low, though, whereas in other professions that skill level might mean a 30, 40 or 50k salary difference.<p>As a child, I thought playing music was about skill, so I learned  classical guitar, and, according to my friends, I was the 'best guitar player they knew'. I always got compliments at shows and on my own albums. I was never even close to being found out by an A&R guy or signed to a record label. And guess what? There are a lot of people like me. 10 years ago I got really into jazz and that was my new circle or 'thing'. I came at music more from a jazz perspective because I knew theory and deconstructed tunes (in all styles) whereas rock musicians don't really like to do that and many of them can't. I remember going to the jazz festival and talking to musicians telling me how 'Yah, we're signed, but we don't even get a free copy of our album. We have to pay for it like everybody else'. These local musicians are successful because they live off their music, but many of them have modest earnings that pay the bills. They can't afford vacationing every year to somewhere fancy and most have beat-up cars, maybe a wife, and no more than one child, if that. They are very humble people.<p>(And yet, and yet) you have people that can hardly sing a note that are famous where their work is based on great post-production sound engineers. It's easy to be bitter about the music industry, but a lot of them aren't. I know I'm not and I listen to Justin Bieber without a problem (though my friends and family think it is very bizarre of me to).<p>The way you reach monetary/economic success as a musician is usually about non-music-related stuff you do, which is strange because in most professions, the way you become successful is by practicing your art and honing your skills.<p>My only friend (my ex-band mate) that is 'successful' tours the world and lives off music, but he barely breaks even, since they have to pay for studio costs, equipment costs, accommodation, car/transportation costs, roadies, etc. He loves it, but he says it is extremely difficult and gets depressed easily. This particular friend knows his limited skills so he goes more for showmanship and energy and getting people pumped - he plays garage rock. The funny (interesting) thing is his band was about to disband when all of a sudden the right A&R guy discovered them. It took probably 4 years of touring the country (Canada) and some parts of the States all on their own expense while having full-time jobs and doing it on their vacation time. Thousands of dollars. He was doing it while we were in a band together and with our band we burnt over 10k of our own money in only a year and a half.<p>Now when I hear him on the radio I love it. I'm so proud of him (and I can picture everyone laughing at me for being such a nerd). But there is a huge element of luck and he knows it. You work hard and don't expect to make it, yet you put yourself through it because you love your art, your music. And you do this for decades.",1345223427

They'll get to that size gradually, with a nice smooth revenue ramp, and without a financial model based on sales heads.

They also detailed what they were doing to make sure that their short-term spending was going to result in long-term returns.  Amazon's letters and SEC filings were focused almost completely on this message: That we're spending money now to make a LOT more money in the future.<p>Facebook, perhaps due to the competitive space that they're in, really haven't done anything like that.  Their filings have more of a ""Deer in the Headlights"" feeling than anything else, with mobile revenue being basically 0, and not adequately explaining the massive expense increases for Q2 2012.

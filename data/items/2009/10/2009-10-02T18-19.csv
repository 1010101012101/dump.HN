I don't think this is Ig Nobel worthy. I've seen much worse.<p>I think Ig Nobel is great and all, god knows a lot of research is far removed from practical applications. And given how important having a publication history is, we need something like this to keep pointing out when things get ridiculous. But I don't think this is all that ridiculous.<p>Plus besides the Ig Nobel, there's literally EVERY other media outlet, print, radio, TV AND Internet that's either making fun of science, criticizing it or completely and totally over hyping it which then leads to disappointment and suspicion. In short, it's all damaging.<p>And then frequently it gets to politics, and then we're fucked, when politics mixes with science, science always loses.<p>I am reminded of Palin and her mockery of fruit fly research. Apologies for bringing up politics on HN, but that really got under my skin. Thank god, someone quickly connected that research to autism. That should be like the 6 degrees from Kevin Bacon game, how quickly can you connect scientific research being criticized by a politician to something that might benefit that same politician or the things he/she supports.<p>Anyway, long rant to say, this isn't really Ig Nobel worthy.",1254509594

857717,comment,857323,857323,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I think part of the problem is that he was attempting to find sublets to fulfill his space needs. This is a pain because each period of stay has to be negotiated, which is time consuming... especially when you are moving around a lot.<p>What you really need to make this work is a provider of living spaces with set prices and set contracts for set durations. Think extended-stay hotels crossed with a fast food joint. You can walk into any McDonalds in the US and know what will be on the menu, and for roughly what price. Likewise, you need a place that you can walk into with various room options and set prices/terms. I guess you could call them franchise apartment complexes.<p>Well obviously the closest thing to what I'm describing is a hotel. The problem with hotels is that they are too expensive, and (often) don't offer kitchens or offices.<p>I'm going to pick $1500 for a reasonable Big City rent amount, which works out to $50 a night. Throw in furniture rental and a maid, and it's probably more like $70 a night. So really, if you could rent a studio apartment as if it were a hotel room for $70 a night, you'd be breaking even but gaining all that flexibility.<p>Of course, in most places rent is much cheaper, so in Kansas City, for instance, the place would need to be more like $30 a night to make sense.<p>I wonder if it's economically possible to offer various apartment size places on a per-night basis at those prices. Does the hotel industry just rampantly overcharge, or is this an economic pipe dream?<p>If you did away with daily maid service (only have maids clean between guests), and things like complimentary laundry service, maybe it would be feasible. Thoughts?<p>Of course, there are other issues, like carting around your wardrobe. Maybe we can have franchise closet/changing rooms too. It'd be like a PO Box for your clothes.",1254509485

These two lines of pseudocode are patented.  In reality, they usually are implemented in just about two lines.  There's nothing non-obvious about it; if you take 15 minutes and go test the only two possible median prediction methods, this one comes up as the best.<p>And yet it's patented.  And most video coding software patents are just like this one: stupid.<p>If you want even more ridiculous ones, just go look at motion search patents; they've basically patented everything under the sun.<p>Patents should be on implementations, not ideas.  <i>Algorithms are ideas, not implementations</i>.

That's what everyone does; if you don't have patents and someone sues you, you can't fight back.<p>Patents on pharmaceuticals do encourage innovation, because the one essential element is the chemical formula (to a lesser extent, the process to produce that chemical), which would easily be copied without protection.  A given software application consists of thousands of lines of code and thousands of algorithmic decision (often hundreds of thousands or millions); if you knew that someone was using an XOR in order to flip bits, it doesn't exactly let you copy their system.  My argument is that patents on software don't encourage innovation because they don't increase the protection that's already there, and the threat of other people's patents is constantly looming and stifles innovation.<p>Look, I'm a software engineer, and I know a lot of other engineers, so I'm not discounting my own or anyone's work or saying it's not valuable and that people shouldn't get paid for it.  What I'm saying is that patenting isn't a useful or appropriate mechanism of protection, that copyright combined with the inherent difficult of duplicating the thousands of features in someone else's application is barrier enough, and that patents actually <i>hurt</i> entrepreneurs and software companies and make it <i>harder</i> for engineers to get paid for their work.",1254508168

Lots of startups patent their software and the algorithms that give their companies a competitive advantage.<p>My argument is that software isn't a special case in the field of innovation.  If someone can patent a solar panel that extracts 10x more energy from the same area, then why shouldn't a company be allowed to patent a software algorithm that can compress data stored on disk to 10% of its original size?  Ultimately, math and science are behind both inventions.<p>I also do not agree that it is <i>pretty clear that software patents are a huge net negative</i>.  You'll have to provide evidence for that.  If you do that, you'll also have to show that patents for software are <i>more</i> negative than patents for mechanical devices or designs in all the other fields if you think software patents should be disallowed, but not patents in other fields.<p>The question is, why don't we disallow ALL patents?

Even in countries in Europe where the rate of homeownership is very low compared to the US, and renting is the dominant social norm even for families earning a good wage, people are still mostly immobile, with a decade in a particular property not at all uncommon.<p>Still, it would be nice for a while.",1254506924

Whenever someone tries to make such a broad patent it's almost always knocked down by the prior art clause (the example you gave would only work if no one had ever put a piece of wood over a puddle to get across before)<p>I personally favor the establishment of some kind of universal license fee that prevents patent holders from hoarding an innovation or charging ridiculous prices for others to use it.  That way those who created a concept still get their just due while not being able to prevent anyone from using their patents to innovate.",1254506564

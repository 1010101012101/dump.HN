If I see a $____ box, my first assumption is that typing &quot;0&quot; has the same effect as typing &quot;-1&quot; or &quot;aaaa&quot;: a validation error. It&#x27;s a very close sibling of the &quot;Sneak Into Basket&quot;[1] UI &quot;dark pattern&quot;.<p>These are the moves that turned me from a fan/advocate of elementary to a critic: not that their software was poor quality (the parts they had actually built were, for the most part, roughly as nice a UI as most other Ubuntu derivatives had in my opinion), but that their philosophy and attitude made them the kind of people I want to actively avoid promoting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://darkpatterns.org/sneak-into-basket/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darkpatterns.org/sneak-into-basket/</a>",1431431988

I have this --possibly flawed-- mental image of emotional impulse voting devoid of any effort to analyze what is being said.<p>For the benefit of those who didn&#x27;t take the time to think before down-voting my prior comment I&#x27;ll try to spell it out here.<p>A few facts:<p>- Good commercial cells deliver an efficiency in the 14% to 19% range.<p>- This efficiency assumes the cells are aimed at the sun<p>- Optimal winter angle for the Netherlands is approximately 76 degrees from horizontal<p>- Peak efficiency also assumes the cells are clean and have nothing obstructing or altering light from reaching it&#x27;s surface at the optimal angle<p>- In all cases you can Google my claims and verify their veracity<p>Option #1:<p>- Cover the solar panels with glass\n- Scuff-up the surface so people and bikes don&#x27;t slip and slide all over the place\n- As an alternative, apply a film to achieve the same effect\n- Mount them flat on the ground\n- Place trees around it\n- Have people, bikes and dogs walk on it<p>Analysis:<p>- The cost of encasing panels in concrete and glass modules and installing them is monumental<p>- The optimal angle for Amsterdam is approximately 76 degrees. Panels mounted flat simply throw away a significant amount of available energy.<p>- Solar cells laid flat will produce between 20% and 30% less when compared to optimally aimed cells.<p>- Glass will create problems based on how light enters.  You have reflection, diffraction and scattering as possibilities.  A percentage of the energy will never reach the cells.<p>- A non-slip surface will scatter and absorb a significant amount of energy.  Based on the images I&#x27;ve seen of these road modules I am going to guestimate that at best 70% of the light entering the road reaches the cells.  I base this on years of working with a wide range of optical diffusers.<p>- Dirt and particles on the cells can have huge efficiency effects.  From light scattering to simply blocking and absorption.  I&#x27;ll go ahead and guess that you can&#x27;t keep a roadway clean 100% of the time, therefore, you probably  pay a, say, 20% penalty on average for having dirt, leaves and dog shit on the road.  This is entirely a seat-of-the-pants number.  It could be 10% or 50%.  It isn&#x27;t going to be zero.<p>- Power generation is now utilization dependent.  With more people on the road more light is blocked and less power is generated.  I won&#x27;t put a number to this.  I will rather make a statement: If nobody uses the road, what&#x27;s the point of building one in the first place or building one that is so much more expensive than simply pouring plain concrete?<p>- Depending on angle, trees, buildings and even tall vehicles on the road will cast shadows on the panels.<p>A very rough calculation then says that, at best, our solar roadway will operate at 40% of peak efficiency.  If we factor in the constant need for cleaning this number could very well go down significantly.  For example, do we have a crew of a few people using gas powered leaf blowers cleaning the roadway a few times a day?<p>Option #2:  Build a light steel structure atop a conventional bike path.  Angle the panels for optimal efficiency at that latitude.  You might splurge and add active tracking.<p>Analysis:<p>- The cost of installation is significantly lower<p>- By mounting the panels at the optimal collection angle we ensure converting power as near to the efficiency peak for the panel in question<p>- Angled mounting also aids in reducing surface particulate contamination and makes cleaning potentially as simple as an automated water sprinkler system<p>- The entire system is far less costly and efficient<p>- The bike path gets &quot;free&quot; shade as a side effect<p>So, yeah, the entire idea is absolutely ridiculous if anyone bothers to do a little math.  Someone has got to be lining their pockets or whoever is leading this project is simply in denial.<p>Go ahead and downvote, but, if you do, please show your calculations and how you arrived at the idea that this concept actually makes sense to deploy at scale.

9530820,comment,9530306,9530306,0,0,embik,,,"Hello everyone, I&#x27;m a contributor to elementary (did some small coding and sitting around in their Slack). I&#x27;m not 100% sure I should post, but I&#x27;ve seen the HN community being very reasonable, so here we go. Please note I&#x27;m in no way official for elementary and I wasn&#x27;t involved with this blog post at all; I just would like to provide another perspective on the topics discussed here.<p>Yes, the blog post is/was terrible worded. That &quot;cheating&quot; thing ... Yeah. It was pretty bad. It&#x27;s a difficult topic to talk about money in FOSS (for obvious reasons) and the blog post did it really the wrong (still does for me, but that&#x27;s a very personal opinion). I&#x27;m also not really okay with the whole pay-before-download thing, but I&#x27;m really not the one entitled to make such decisions.<p>From my point of view, the whole idea was &quot;people should support things they like&quot;. I completely understand some do not like Pantheon and think it&#x27;s a OS X ripoff (I&#x27;ve seen people calling almost everything &quot;osx ripoff&quot;, but there are parallels between OS X and elementary, no doubt). Therefore, these don&#x27;t understand why they should pay for something they do not value. Totally understandable. But there are people who love elementary (even more than OS X, for that matter) and are using it on a daily basis. elementary matters to these people and there are two ways of supporting FOSS projects you are using: Contribute time (code) or money. There are better ways of shifting attention to this, of course. I don&#x27;t doubt that ...<p>What baffles me nonetheless is how people view &quot;us&quot; (the elementary devs) for single blog posts and a few design desicions (I&#x27;m not talking about the website stuff, more about desktop design) people disagree with. Well, I&#x27;m totally biased of course, but there really is no vibe of &quot;money grabing&quot; or &quot;entitlement&quot; around the team. Most of us are young guys from all over the world coding on elementary in their spare time. It&#x27;s a difficult thing to make money with a desktop-focused Linux distro and there is nobody really making money. Nobody&#x27;s in for the big bucks. It would be lovely to employ some of the devs full-time, but that&#x27;s simply not possible at the moment. elementary won&#x27;t be the next big thing people throw money at, and everyone&#x27;s aware of that fact.<p>Regarding &quot;give money back to Ubuntu / GNU / the kernel&quot;, which is a difficult topic as well ... I&#x27;m trying to get my words right. Let&#x27;s say, most of these things are in the lucky situation of corporate interest; Canonical is making their money via Ubuntu (server) support and server services (I frankly doubt they make a lot of money via the desktop), same applies to the kernel. The amounts of money elementary could provide to these projects / companies / whatever would show elementary&#x27;s good intentions, but it&#x27;d a drop in the bucket. Whenever possible, elementary tries to bring patches upstream to benefit everyone. As Pantheon is building heavily on top of the GNOME stack, some devs pushed bug fixes and features to GTK or Mutter. We have some guys from Xfce, GNOME and other FOSS projects around to talk about our stuff if we think they would be useful for others. elementary is a really small project with only a few constant contributors, but everyone is trying to give their best.<p>Hopefully I was able to describe my stance without coming off as entitled. If not, please forgive me.",1431428976

But once bloggers actually get hacked to death, you definitely do <i>know</i>, for sure.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would or should feel comfortable getting death threats via any medium.

Let me share my story here. I am at the same level of experience as you are 6 and half years into software.<p>I started in a big software service shop in India. Worked for amazing clients (I cannot name them here). Some of the technology that I have worked on - Java, Lisp (yep got paid for working in common lisp), C/C++, Hadoop, JavaScript, etc.  After working for 4 years I decided to move on. But I got Job in one of the news companies. Worked there for more that 1.5 years in (C# and Java). Now working in a banking product based company.<p>After all these years (not that much though), I have come to the conclusion that - you need to be a techie to survive software industry. I have defined growth as: learn a new language every 6 months. Do something extra like open source. I know, I may not get hefty pay packets like the managers in India but I have chosen this path. I am happy with that.<p>For you I believe you have identified your areas for improvement. You just need to think deep why the schedule failed? Find and read some books Mythical Man Month and Peopleware. Chances are that people have already been there and done that - so learn from them and try to adapt and apply in your case.<p>Moreover, <i>before you do anything else</i> just ask yourself what do you really want to be - a manager or a techie.

They don't do anything as a whole by definition. You have to consider their rhetoric in general and whether or not they accept actions taken by members of the group. If one guy says 'we hate Scientology' and the majority of people who identify with Anonymous agree with that guy in principle, guess what? The group has just made an implicit collective declaration. You can't identify as a member of a group and be an active participant in it and then claim no responsibility for the group's actions just because there's supposedly no leader or official stance on anything. You are an accomplice, or if you prefer, a willing participant by association. This wouldn't be the case if the entire idea of the group weren't that there is no central decision-making; you can distance yourself from a voice which no longer represents the majority, but you cannot distance yourself from that which cannot be identified unless you step outside of the ether entirely.<p>Which actions do you mean?

If you do SPDY on the backend server, you cause a lot of additional problems:<p>1) your backend servers should use their hardware for actually running the web application, not for encrypting responses.<p>2) usually, your backend servers only serve the dynamically generated content. SPDY's biggest advantage is that it would allow to handle multiple requests in one connection, but this really shines for static assets (images, stylesheets) which in turn are rarely served by the backend.<p>3) Even if you want to do SPDY on the backend, your frontend proxies still have to support it, because that's what the clients are talking to.<p>So as it stands now, having SPDY on the backend server (or even in your application like this project here) doesn't really give you any of SPDY's advantages unless you begin serving all of your site directly from your application servers, which we learned over the last years, just doesn't scale as well.",1325670005

I don't advocate piracy, but there is a stupid notion of ""lost profit"" when every pirated copy is assumed the copy not purchased. Sorry, but it does not work this way.
If someone thinks that the price is to high or simply does not have the money then in the piracy-free world that person would simply not purchase the product.
So, does this kind of person really harm the producer when he pirates in real world?
What if he shows the pirated movie to his friends and they like it so much that they go and buy a copy for themselves?

This is irrelevant to whether SOPA is a good solution to the alleged problem.  I perceive two separate debates: whether piracy is a ""problem"" and whether SOPA solves that ""problem.""<p>SOPA is simply an industry of middlemen asking a heavier hand to come down and reinforce a business model the market has allowed to decline.  Whether that is because customers demand better options and are not being satisfied or not is largely immaterial.  The so-called act of piracy is already illegal, and what is being asked for is not legal recourse for this (that already exists) but a course of action immune from repudiation and challenge.  It is a unilateral action without oversight or representation, and for this reason it is contrary to the foundation of the Constitution.  Typically, the more egregious offenses carry the stiffest penalties, but all allow for some sort of defense and reasonable trial.  If society has deemed that this is a more serious offense than previously evaluated, legislation increasing the penalty can be enacted, but legislation removing one's ability to defend oneself prior to punishment being enacted is unthinkable.<p>Private entities are being legislatively appointed to enforce public law, and this is unacceptable.  It is a conflict of interest, as the public has no means to remove from ""office"" those serving the public in this manner.  In all other aspects of public law, one has a vote somewhere in the chain to reconcile abuse of power.  We can not vote on a private company whose enforcement of the law becomes corrupt, save economically, and economically our vote is severely disadvantaged.",1325669142

Again, drugs is a great example because we have great costs as a society for law enforcement and prisons dedicated to making drugs illegal versus quite possibly less costs if at least some drugs were legal.<p>To tie this back to the issue, I think SOPA taxes the Google's, Facebook's, etc of the world in an attempt to deal with piracy, which will only increase our costs as citizens for those services and not really solve the problem.

None of the laws we have made something go away completely just by it being illegal.",1325667921

The mouth-watering grilled dishes that you had admired in restaurants and thought took ages to prepare, can now easily be cooked at your home without spending a lot of time struggling to ignite the wood chunks in charcoal barbecues. Thanks to the introduction of gas barbecues you can now enjoy distinctly flavoured grilled dishes without actually cooking them for half a day.",1325667895
3423363,story,,,6,3,mtayseer,"Ask HN: How to grow after 6 years of work?",,"I started my professional career more than 6 years ago. I started at a small company (less than
10 people). We were mainly a mobile development shop. I was known as 'polyglot guy' and 'Moving 
MSDN' working with the various technologies (C++, C#, Python, Java) on various platforms
(Symbian, Windows CE, Windows, Java ME).<p>Then the company met a lot of management and financial problems. The manager made a lot of mistakes
and later closed the company. This was very hard for me considering that I'm responsible for my 
mom & younger sisters after my father died. I worked there for 1.5 years.<p>Then I moved to another small company, working on ASP.net. I was able to learn it very fast & become 
productive with it, performing very well at the beginning & used my good points (learning fast & using 
various technologies well) but I met some problems when I was responsible for a whole project for 
the first time. We ran very late & the quality was very low. Adding to this that the company was
really bad when it comes to collecting their money, it was financially unstable. I had to leave
after 1.5 years, though I liked this company very much.<p>For the next 1.5 years I worked in 3 small companies, 6 months in each one. This was really a 
horrible period of my life. We were always overloaded with work, project scope was rapidly 
increasing with the same cost. We were working for 16 hours a day. We were treated badly. 
Everything I tried to do was not enough to save any company.<p>I didn't try to fight till the last possible moment. I had enough of small failing companies. I was
convinced that to create a successful software project I should focus on management, not the 
technical side<p>I went to work in a large software company, not as a senior programmer (as I used to be) but 
outsourced to another big company as a technical project manager. I accepted this position for 3 
reasons<p><pre><code>    1. It is financially stable
    2. To enhance my communication & management skills
    3. This was the only way to grow
</code></pre>
Contrary to my previous positions, I had manage many small interdependent tasks. I wasn't good
at doing this. I slipped the deadline most of the time. I have to ask everyone at each step multiple
times to do anything. All the time. I'm always blamed because I'm responsible. What makes me angry
is that it's late because of somebody else. The only parts that went well were the parts that I made 
myself, or any tool that I made to automate a manual process. I'm much slower than any other 
colleage in my team & the whole company, even people who are much younger than me<p>After sometime I knew that I'm not good at this. I asked my mother company to return to their HQ
and work on a more technical position, but they said there isn't a vacant place for me. Later I
asked for a communication skills many times, which I got finally.<p>I don't know how to grow in my career. I don't want to work on management, but I alsp want to feel 
that my work is valuable & affecting the company positively. Here in Egypt the only way to grow is to
go the management path.<p>I also want to work with Python. All the companies here either use C#, Java, C++ or PHP.",1325667886

However, there's a significant flaw in it, where he discusses how Obama was excused but Paul isn't:<p><i>Obama did it with Jeremiah Wright, openly grappling with the past toxic association, owning it, explaining it. Paul has not had the wherewithal or presence of mind to do that. Indeed, he has not even named the association, the first step to disowning it.</i><p>But this is false, he did address it <i>four years ago</i>. I've linked and quoted that statement below. [1]<p>Also, Sullivan goes on to say ""And unlike Obama with Wright, Paul got money from these newsletters.""<p>You'll have to make your own value judgments here, but I think Obama comes out worse. It's true that Paul profited. However, it seems clear to me that Obama's relationship with the real perpetrator (Wright, in his case) was far closer than Paul's. Obama chose Wright to baptize his daughters, and used Wright's ideas for the title of his book <i>The Audacity of Hope</i>. This make me believe that Obama had a close, respectful relationship with Wright, and that some of Wrights ideas molded Obama's own. None of these things can be said of Ron Paul with respect to those newsletters.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/08/idUS233377+08-Jan-2008+BW20080108"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/08/idUS233377+08-Jan-...</a><p>""The quotations in The New Republic article are not mine and do

Instead, give them some pointers on how they might solve it, but leave ownership of the solution with them. This is hard to do consistently, particularly when it would take you less time to do the work yourself, but the long-term effect is that you grow a team of self-sufficient people, who only bring you problems when they have tried hard to solve them themselves and genuinely need your help.

The best one could do is come up with a specific design and estimate the number of gates needed, and then one couldn't be sure exactly how suboptimal the design in question is, regarding gate count.
One of the most basic design choices is probably how much and which work to do using dedicated logic, and how much to do using general purpose logic and microcode.
One may get an idea of the order of magnitude of gates required by taking a minimal CPU core (say, the j1 core from <a href=""http://excamera.com/sphinx/fpga-j1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://excamera.com/sphinx/fpga-j1.html</a>), writing a minimal lisp interpreter on that core, and adding the gates needed to store the interpreter to the number of gates used for the core.

Companies needed recurring revenue to pay for increasingly complex development costs between major versions (well, and some were just greedy).

The ideas are just now congealing.<p>That's good news because it means the field is wide open -- there are going to be a lot of cool new developments. But it's also bad news because every book you get is going to be hit-and-miss: a few good ideas, a few ideas that sound wacky, and a lot of noise. Agile is like that. It's a collection of best practices around iterative and incremental technology development. That's why it drives some folks nuts: different people can give you different answers and in the end it's all about custom tailoring and results-oriented process. What we're seeing now is this agile/best-practices idea extended to the startup world. That's a good thing! There's really good stuff in there. But it's going to evolve over many years, and just like Agile in the end you're not going to end up with a recipe book as much as a place to start, a lot of good material to absorb, and some guiding principles. It'll probably be something like the learn-do-adapt process we see in Scrum (Obligatory plug: just blogged about this the other day and posted about it on HN. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3404085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3404085</a>)<p>So I like the Lean Startup idea.

Therefore, an hour spent reading about, say CoffeeScript in blogs is equivalent to an hour spent reading a CoffeeScript book, only the blogs are free, immediate, and more entertaining.<p>The last bit is the key. They reason that blog posts are more entertaining is the reason to read the book. They are all sizzle, with optional steak. A book has <i>structure</i>, as Avdi notes, and part of that structure is balance between crazy-fascinating things and fundamentals that are not that fascinating at first but necessary for deep learning.<p>In cliche terms, books contain information that is important but not urgent. Thanks to the social mechanics of blogs and social news sites and retweeting, the blog posts the filter through the firehose are all urgency. Some also contain important topics, but none contain the important but not urgent stuff that is necessary for a complete education. Any blog post or essay with important but not urgent information falls into people’s “read this later” bucket and never gets the upvotes to make the front page of Hacker News or anything else.<p>So, you will learn things in an hour on the web, and in an hour reading a book, but if your primary goal is a thorough education in something that is new to you, an hour in a good book will serve you better than an hour reading blog posts.<p>p.s. Alas, my own books at <a href=""http://leanpub.com/u/raganwald"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leanpub.com/u/raganwald</a> are simply collections of blog posts massaged into book format, and as such they are entertaining but do not provide the kind of structure and “important but not urgent” information Avdi and I are extolling here.

One of the best resources I found was (luckily) my own boss.  Find others in a similar (or higher) position and talk with them regularly, openly, and candidly about any challenges you're facing.<p>I wish I had better advice, but what you'll find is that being a good manager/team lead is at least as hard as your old job (and probably harder).  Continuing to do your old job alongside it, while probably a good idea for your own job satisfaction/sanity, will only make it harder.<p>Random bits of advice I find helpful:<p>* Your primary job is to shield your direct reports from management BS (false priorities, unrealistic deadlines, company drama); while this is less of a problem at a small startup, don't ignore it.  Your secondary job is to make your direct reports look good; promote what they're doing and make sure what they're doing is aligned with the company's goals.<p>* Schedule 1:1 meetings.  See Rands' advice on how to structure and run them, but basically keep them short, informal, and regular.  Start with a softball and use it as a time for your direct reports to warn you about any upcoming problems that may be bubbling.   Avoid the temptation for status reports, one larger team meeting instead, etc.  Sit down with each individual direct report and get to know them better.<p>* Set clear goals and priorities for everyone.<p>* Avoid the temptation to micro-manage.  You may eventually find you have an employee who has to be micromanaged, but most people hate it and will find it counter-productive.  While this sounds obvious, it's hard for someone who likely got to their new management position because they were the best at the job they're now managing.

There's a ton of bias and falacious thinking going on here.<p>Right off the bat, you wear your bias on your sleeve.<p>> So at the risk of letting my soul get sucked into the fanboi dark side, I bought the cheapest MacBook Pro and started working with it as my main machine.<p>So if you buy a Mac, there's some kind of inherent risk that you'll become a ""fanboi""?<p>> What’s so amazing about this story is that when people are confronted with a problem in an Apple product, in most cases they assume it’s the user’s fault.<p>I've done my time in the trenches of end-user support. There's a reason that most people capable of solving computer problems start with the user; because it's most frequently the user. This is true of Macs, PCs, phones, microwaves, VCRs, you name it. You always start by verifying that the user isn't doing something unexpected. That is a problem to be solved in and of itself, but it's not unique to Mac culture.<p>> I hear many people criticizing Android’s responsiveness etc, but no one criticizing iPhone 3GS’s horrible sluggishness since iOS 4.0.<p>I cannot think of a worse example. The 3GS was introduced in 2009. When people criticize Android's responsiveness, those complaints are levied against brand new devices.<p>Roee, I can tell you exactly why your brand new MacBook Pro was screaming like a jet fighter, and it's not your fault. OS X has a few background processes that can eat up your CPU cycles causing high load and therefore high fan speeds. The primary culprit is Spotlight. There are a set of Spotlight indexing processes (mds, I'm looking at you) that will push the CPU at 100% for extended periods.<p>IMO, Apple could do a few things to remedy this:<p>* Throttle the Spotlight indexing service (and other background-only services) based on CPU temperature. Apple controls the entire hardware/software stack, so they can consistently rely on this information. It sounds silly, but when I make large changes to my filesystem, I see the same issue, and it can be really annoying to listen to my MBP whir loudly on my desk. Other users find it downright concerning.<p>* Provide an ""Advanced Options"" button in the Spotlight preferences where we can use a slider control balance the speed of updates and CPU usage. This slider should start out somewhere lower than ""update Spotlight at all costs, even if the system load is at 3.99"".<p>* Update Activity Monitor to include a more user friendly view of what's using the most system resources by CPU, memory, and disk activity. The process list is great for geeks, but my mom has no idea what launchd, SystemUIServer or mds are. Disk activity has no transparency beyond ops per second and throughput. There is no user facing method of determining what application is making orders of magnitude more file system requests than anything else on the system.<p>If Apple did any of the above, they'd be doing 10x more than anyone else in the industry. Hell, Soluto is in the business of providing exactly this kind of information. Roee, how about you look in to providing these kinds of details through Soluto for Mac? I'd recommend you to everyone inside my network.",1325257745

Given your nature (I know from experience) it will be hard but you just have to trust in your people. Hire people that you believe are smarter than you, this will help in delegation because you will perceive their opinions higher than your own.

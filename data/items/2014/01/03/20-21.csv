My answer: nothing. SVMs are designed to handle high-dimensional data. I&#x27;m working on a research problem right now that involves supervised classification using SVMs. Along with finding sources on the Internet, I did my own experiments on the impact of dimensionality reduction prior to classification. Preprocessing the features using PCA/LDA did not significantly increase classification accuracy of the SVM.&quot;<p>I can see how that relates to currency detection.",1388782706

The CEO was verbally abusive over the phone and in writing such as in emails and text messages. The contract stated that she would get $X amount for Y hours of work per week. After enough abuse they gave the company the notice and asked to be paid the already late invoice for the previous month and the current invoice submitted a day or two prior and due in less than a week. Now the company has presented a termination contract with all the sorts of reprehensible clauses we are discussing here and they are stating that the consideration is that they won&#x27;t dispute the hours itemized on the last invoice. They refuse to pay the final invoice unless this person signs the termination contract. This isn&#x27;t worth seeing a lawyer about given the invoice amount.<p>Furthermore, the person in question was hired to do administrative work for the company, which is what they did initially, but ended up handling almost exclusively personal issues for the CEO for last few months, which quite frankly strikes me as malfeasance since the CEO was paying for personal assistance needs with company funds.

If the 40MB is just the initial bloom filter download, that&#x27;s not so bad. If 40MB is the daily diff, I&#x27;d be interested in seeing the calculation for that.",1388781166

There&#x27;s an unbelievable amount of bullshit in ketogenic diet circles about it - to the point an absurd reverse of well researched results. It&#x27;s one of the <i>very</i> well researched downsides of any low-carb, high protein diets. The trick is to eat low-carb <i>and</i> low-protein as high-protein diets simply aren&#x27;t good on kidneys. But then you&#x27;re basically just eating fats and that gets boring. It&#x27;s very hard to get dietary fats without one or the other though.<p><a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_die"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet</a><p><a href""http://site.matthewsfriends.org/uploads/File/StonesPolycitra1.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://site.matthewsfriends.org/uploads/File/StonesPolycitra...</a><p><a href""http://www.webmd.com/diet/high-protein-low-carbohydrate-diet"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.webmd.com/diet/high-protein-low-carbohydrate-diet...</a><p>&quot;By restricting carbohydrates drastically to a mere fraction of that found in the typical American diet, the body goes into a different metabolic state called ketosis, whereby it burns its own fat for fuel. Normally the body burns carbohydrates for fuel -- this is the main source of fuel for your brain, heart ,and many other organs. A person in ketosis is getting energy from ketones, little carbon fragments that are the fuel created by the breakdown of fat stores. When the body is in ketosis, you tend to feel less hungry, and thus you&#x27;re likely to eat less than you might otherwise. However, ketosis can also cause health problems, such as kidney failure (see below).&quot;<p>&quot;What Are the Risks Linked to High Protein, Low-Carb Diets?<p>High protein, low-carb diets can cause a number of health problems, including:<p>Kidney failure. Consuming too much protein puts a strain on the kidneys, which can make a person susceptible to kidney disease.\nHigh cholesterol . It is well known that high-protein diets (consisting of red meat, whole dairy products, and other high fat foods) are linked to high cholesterol. Studies have linked high cholesterol levels to an increased risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and cancer.\nOsteoporosis and kidney stones. High-protein diets have also been shown to cause people to excrete a large amount of calcium in their urine. Over a prolonged period of time, this can increase a person&#x27;s risk of osteoporosis and kidney stones. A diet that increases protein at the expense of a very restrictive intake of plant carbohydrates may be bad for bones, but not necessarily a high-protein intake alone.\nCancer. One of the reasons high-protein diets increase the risks of certain health problems is because of the avoidance of carbohydrate-containing foods and the vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants they contain. It is therefore important to obtain your protein from a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Not only are your needs for protein being met, but you are also helping to reduce your risk of developing cancer.\nUnhealthy metabolic state (ketosis). Low-carb diets can cause your body to go into a dangerous metabolic state called ketosis since your body burns fat instead of glucose for energy. During ketosis, the body forms substances known as ketones, which can cause organs to fail and result in gout, kidney stones, or kidney failure. Ketones can also dull a person&#x27;s appetite, cause nausea and bad breath. Ketosis can be prevented by eating at least 100 grams of carbohydrates a day.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s tons more. But I can&#x27;t be bothered right now.",1388780706

7007817,comment,7005374,7005374,41,0,grellas,,,"Non-disparagement clauses can be seen as a throwaway item, a suffocating burden, an essential protection, or a damned nuisance, each according to taste or context.<p>To begin with, lawyers tend to see these clauses as essential protections and they are sometimes right. But, right or wrong, they tend to insist upon them, especially in the employment context. This explains their prevalence but, of course, does not necessarily justify their use.<p>Just to illustrate the cases where they truly are an essential protection, you and a competitor have been fighting for years in court over ugly and untrue things that someone has said about you or your company - non-trivial things that have really hurt you. When it comes time to settle that case, a continuing non-disparagement obligation will be not only helpful but essential to the resolution. The same is true in many other legal fights. When emotions have run high, and parties have antipathy toward one another, it is good practice to help ensure the peace after their fight has been settled to require that they not speak badly of one another and to give a simple mechanism such as binding arbitration to help resolve any follow-on dispute over whether they have done so or not. In such cases, there are excellent reasons to bind parties contractually to restraints on their ability to speak where they would normally be free to do so.<p>The employment context gets trickier because the antecedent acrimony that characterizes a legal fight may well not be present at the time of a termination and the question then arises: why am I being artificially muzzled? And there is a point to this: why be barred from speaking <i>truthfully</i> about a former situation even if it might be negative? why be at risk of a harassing lawsuit over what it means that something &quot;may&quot; reflect &quot;negatively&quot; about someone? why, in an age of easy communication through social media, be made to feel you cannot even speak about something that may have been a major part of your life, perhaps for many years? What may be seen as a throwaway item by some can be felt to be suffocating by others, and all the more so because it is tacked onto a token severance that gives you very little in exchange.<p>That said, I would say that the overwhelming number of employers and employees alike see these simply as throwaway items. They figure no one will care about such clauses except the lawyers. And, in most cases, they are probably right. The question then becomes whether one should not sign as a matter of principle or whether to just sign and take the money. Most employees take the money.<p>Of course, employees can push back if they have leverage. No one is obligated by law to sign a separation agreement. If the terms aren&#x27;t right, and can be made right, then push back. Insist that the token severance be made more substantial. Or that non-disparagement, if it is to be included at all, be made mutual (it can be quite a head-ache for a large employer to keep control of its many people to ensure that none speak badly of you). Or insist that it be narrowed or clarified so as to reduce or eliminate vagueness about what may or may not be deemed disparaging. Or insist that it be coupled with other considerations that give you benefits apart from your normal final pay, etc. This sort of negotiation can make these clauses a big nuisance from the employer standpoint and may cause the employer simply to drop the clause. However, all of this assumes employee leverage, which doesn&#x27;t often exist in the routine case, and so, as noted above, most employees simply take the money, accept the restriction, and don&#x27;t bother to look back.<p>And so it all depends. For the author of this piece, this was a critical issue. For many others, it is not. Context is critical. And for all but trivial cases, do check with a good lawyer to understand the implications of what you are signing. If the risks are real, there is nothing worse that a harassing lawsuit from a former employer angry with you over some statement you made out of emotion. This is what gives these clauses a bad name and it is also what can make them dangerous. In such cases, be cautious about exposing yourself to such risks in exchange for some token severance. It is probably not worth it.",1388780174

Even if they receive an item in mint condition and then drop it or break it, all Paypal needs is proof it is broken and they will refund the buyer the money and the seller is SOL.<p>Where else does business work like that? I can&#x27;t buy a shirt and wear it for 30 days then ask for a refund when it rips. I can&#x27;t buy an Iphone and use it for 30 days then ask for a refund when I drop it. I can&#x27;t buy a car and use it for 30 days then ask for a refund when I crash it.",1388779208

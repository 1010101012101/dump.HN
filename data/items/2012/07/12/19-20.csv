You will need a Unix (OS X should work fine) machine with LLVM 3.1 installed (including its library headers in /usr/include/llvm-c).  Once you've got those prerequisites, the command ""ant build"" will build the library and leave you with two files: jllvm.jar and libjllvm.so.<p>Put those where your Java Native Interface linker/loader can find the .so and your JVM can find jllvm.jar and its classes, and you should be able to link to the library and use the classes.<p>The classes themselves mirror, as best I could do, those in the official LLVM C++ interface.  Method names and behavior should match the official ones.<p>I never actually stopped work on decac.  If you browse the Hg repo, you'll notice a branch called ""newsig"" where I've been working for the past year.  Around exactly a year ago, I noticed that decac could compile code examples, but could <i>not</i> link together different modules properly without crashing and lacked a region/effect system (and thus a way to properly handle memory allocation outside the stack).<p>Given those two problems were architectural, I rewrote the compiler around a ""new signature"" system for type, effect, and region signatures.  This means I have to update the language report quite a lot, but it also has yielded a cleaner language and <i>much</i> cleaner code inside the compiler.  Expressions are now described by one class rather than three, and there's a clean architecture for linking different modules together.",1342123066

Sure, sometimes you need to write a macro or script or something...but, I can count the lines of vim code I've written in my entire 20+ years of programming on my fingers and toes (if I count vimrc stuff, it'll require a few other people's fingers and toes, but it's still statistically zero compared the amount of code and docs I've written in that time).<p>I'll leave it to Bram Moollenaar figure out how to improve vim. He's added Python support to vim years ago. Is Python really insufficient for you? I've never needed it, but if I were making something big for vim, I'd probably look into it. But, again, I'd rather be working on the stuff I'm passionate about. Editing text is not a problem I'm excited about; if it's your bag, that's great. But, for the rest of us, it's just a form of procrastination to fiddle and futz around with new tools when the old ones are more than sufficient (and probably superior, on the whole, to new ones...sure, TextMate is super-badass and awesome; but it's missing tons of capabilities that vim and emacs have, and you'd probably be better off learning how to maximize your efficiency in those more powerful editors, than learning new tools which will come and go).",1342122585

This is at 2 AM Japan time but I am just putzing around on HN so I apologize to Ruriko, say that I'm going to make a five minute phone call, and call him from my cell phone in Japan.  He asks a typical pre-sales question, I answer it, and we're done in five minutes.<p>Fast forward to three hours later: phone rings.  Customer X, who now has my Japanese phone number, is calling with a new issue.  He has been using the software and thinks that grey text on a yellow button is difficult to read, and I should fix this for him.  He sent me an email but I didn't respond to it.  I tell him that I live in Japan, that it is 5 AM, and that I will ordinarily respond to emails within 24 hours.  He asks another question and I, somewhat testily, strongly suggest writing it in an email and end the conversation.<p>Next day, he calls back at 2 AM.  He wonders whether the software will also send SMSes.  I tell him that the first line of text on the front page is ""Appointment Reminder sends out customizable phone reminders, text message reminders (also called SMS reminders), and email reminders to your clients, so that they come in on time and you get paid."" and that he could have asked this question over email.  I then remind him that I am in Japan, that it is 2 AM in the morning, and that the service level for a $29 a month account is best-effort email.<p>Three days and six calls later I finally lose my patience and tell him something to the effect of: ""There is an actual cost involved in having our head engineer wake up at 5 AM to answer your phone calls, which -- by the way -- you have made more of in the last week than our entire customer base has ever.  If you need this level of service, you should purchase an SLA, which will cost you north of $5,000 a month, or I will assist you in finding a service provider more appropriate to your needs.""<p>Customer X takes the hint, then begins badgering me over email.  Despite having time zones and the 24 hour thing explained multiple times, he gets very upset when I don't respond to emails in 20 minutes.  My happiness level deteriorates over the week.<p>Finally, I tell Customer X that he is making economically non-viable use of customer support, and that if he needs this level of support, I will assist him in finding a provider appropriate to his needs.  I then explicitly, for the first time, mention that we can terminate accounts.  That's the only time in my life I have hinted at that threat.<p>This quiets him down.  Several weeks later he self-cancels and I take Ruriko out to dinner to celebrate.<p>But again, compared to the amount of drama I suffered when full-time employed, this is a funny story affecting 2% of my time, I've made a process improvement to avoid it in the future (I now do customer phone calls through a Twilio proxy so they don't get my Japanese cell number and, if someone is X-like again, I will cut them off earlier), and I'm currently enjoying my honeymoon in Hawaii 98% disconnected with no real worries.",1342122276
4236351,comment,4235525,4235525,7,0,xanadohnt,,,"Groupon needs to fail.  The faster the better.  Often the small business owners that are attracted to Groupon's service are not technologically savvy.  They become starry eyed with the promise of new customers, business (and - ultimately - money), and don't grasp what's at risk.  It's typical for a business owner to have a wholly negative experience with a Groupon sale.  ""Grouponers"" have a certain DNA.  And that DNA is at odds with what Groupon promises.  ""Attract new customers"" - NO, most only go to the merchant for that single, highly discounted, offering, never to return.  ""Attract collateral business"" - NO, studies show grouponers rarely purchase beyond the sale item.  ""Make lots of money during the sale because you'll get a guarantee number of X buyers"" - NO, Groupon keeps such a large percentage of the sale (50%) that most sales operate at a loss to the merchant.<p>But there are more systemic issues with Gropoun, merchant, and employee relationships.  Again, the DNA of a grouponer - being that of a deal thrift - often leads to a strained relationship between employees and grouponers.  No use in fostering good rapport with the customer; you'll never see 'em again.  Tips will be small (again, deal thrift), upselling is improbable, etc., all leading to employees often becoming resentful toward grouponers.

It's primarily useful when you need to change the screen resolution without affecting other applications.<p>You say that the feature was deleted from Quicktime, but that's not what happened.  Quicktime 7 and Quicktime X have different code bases.  Quicktime 7's fullscreen functionality predate the current fullscreen API, and so there's a chunk of code in the Quicktime 7 player itself to futz around with window levels, types, desktop modes, and animate the whole thing.  The Quicktime X application uses a different framework for video AND a different framework for the GUI, I doubt that you could bring much code from Quicktime 7 to Quicktime X.<p>Quicktime 7 used the old Quicktime library with Carbon.

It's a violation of metaphor: ""full screen mode"" is actually ""dedicated space mode,"" which isn't what multi-monitor users expect or want.<p>From personal experience, I suspect this feature is intended to make Spaces more accessible to novice users on laptops without external monitors, a common case.  I never got the hang of Spaces originally, but once I started using full-screen mode while portable, my laptop got immensely more useful.  For me, this was a gateway into the rest of Spaces, and now I maintain 3 desktop spaces and 1 full-screen app, and switch between them and Mission Control with trackpad gestures.  Heck, I might even start using Dashboard, since it's sitting right there.  (Ok, probably not.)

When you are entering text, you enter insert mode. When you are done, back to command mode. Once you have that mental model, you don't try to c-v(or c-shift-v or whatever) in command mode. Also, if you are willing to try vim, grab a vim build with clipboard support and copy-paste from within vim(=+p paste clipboard, =<i>p paste x selection, =+y{motion} copy to clipboard ... in command mode; or ctrl-r+ paste from clipboard, ctrl-r</i> paste from x selection in insert mode)<p>> I find the concepts of modes jarring, even antiquated.<p>The thing I like about vim is translating intent to vim commands - delete 10 lines and then move to the top of the file 10ddG, delete everything inside these parens and put me in insert mode cib etc. Without modes, these won't be as short and sweet. You will be left with long key combinations - the way emacs does it.<p>> Emacs is better in this regard but I find Emacs's need to consecutive key presses (or a key press followed by a command) to be longwinded.<p>Isn't that obvious? If you always want to be in insert mode, how else will the special instructions be entered?<p>> The advantage of either is they're easy to use over ssh+screen (or tmux) for resuming sessions.<p>And they are very good at editing text, and majority of programming languages, though might require some configuration.<p>> For statically typed languages (eg Java/C#), IDEs (quite rightly) rule supreme. Static code analysis, auto-completion, etc are just so much better than text-based editors.<p>I generally am able to find something for Vim which makes language specific stuff easy.<p>Clojure - <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501</a>\nJava - <a href=""http://eclim.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eclim.org/</a>\nGo - <a href=""https://github.com/nsf/gocode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nsf/gocode</a>\nC - <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302</a>\nPython - <a href=""http://rope.sourceforge.net/ropevim.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rope.sourceforge.net/ropevim.html</a><p>And a lot more...<p>> I tend to think the speed differences over not using the mouse are largely illusory.<p>Doesn't that depend on the task? What will be faster - ctrl-f on this page or clicking edit(or some menu)->find?<p>Also, for me, it is more about having my fingers on home row is the sweet spot and moving my fingers from my sweet spot is irritating.",1342119610

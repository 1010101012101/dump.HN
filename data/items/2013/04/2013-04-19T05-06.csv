I had the privilege of meeting customers over dinner with our salesperson. Those dinners were valuable for establishing trust for conference calls I occasionally do.<p>> Instead you should what...take a 9-5 so you can have a life outside of work, so you can work on your side project instead of working at a start up.<p>This is exactly what I'm doing.

News cameras may give you pictures of the amount of police officers at the scene, but they cannot get close enough to give you video of what's actually happening. The irony is that of those three sources of information (Web site, radio, news camera), the best source of ""real time"" information is the oldest. Yes, it's true that the scanner is being broadcast over the internet, but you could listen to the police scanner with amateur radio equipment decades ago.<p>EDIT: I find that it is much easier to listen to the police scanner than a news station, because the SNR ratio is much higher. When there is a break in the action, news reporters fill the air time with speculation or repeat the same old information. On the police scanner, when they have no new information, they are silent.<p>Having said that, I still find it cool to hear an officer ask the dispatcher (on the radio) to tell an overhead helicopter to point a searchlight at a certain location, and moments later see on television a helicopter flying overhead with its searchlight on.",1366350877

    Japanese consumers even want these services that
    we from the West can no longer imagine life without.
    Hulu and Sony are making good starts, but they 
    certainly have their work cut out for them in Japan.
    As far as I can tell, most people are pretty happy as
    long as they live within bicycle distance of a Tsutaya
     thats basically everyone in Tokyo, by the way  and
    its convenient, cheap access to rented media. Which,
    of course, can be copied and kept forever; a practice
    that Tsutaya has gone out of its way to encourage by 
    actually selling burnable discs and drives alongside its
    J-pop CDs. And for casual consumers, maybe it is a better
    solution. No DRM, no extortionate prices, and a sense of
    ownership. Thats the thing about Japan  for better or 
    worse, you can always count on the place to march to the 
    beat of a different drummer.
</code></pre>
Like I said: different.<p>It reminds me of how Japan kept (and keeps) using fax machines. It seems archaic, but fax machines are dramatically easier to use and far more reliable than any email system every devised.<p>Part of what is going on here is that all the digital solutions suck too much ass. It took Apple ten years from when they launched iTunes Store to make the legal digital music scene actually better than CDs (when they finally shitcanned all DRM and stopped sucking more than the process of driving to Best Buy). It took an Amazon to make digital books not suck balls.<p>Nobody has done that with movies and TV yet (other than the bootleg torrent scene, I mean). But I note the article mentions Hulu is doing well in Japan. Well, the suck-ass Hulu that they have in America wouldn't do well here -- they had to make Japanese Hulu significantly better (no ads, faster speeds, subtitles, etc). It's still not good enough that I can say walking down the street to Tsutaya is Doing It Wrong.<p>I'm not saying the Japanese are the masters of the Internet, either. It turns out that the reason all Japanese websites look like shit is because that's how the Japanese want 'em. I spoke to an engineer for Rakuten at the last HN Tokyo meetup -- turns out Rakuten actually <i>does</i> have some designers and they've A/B tested their current 450-blinking-mini-banners-per-6MB-page against some clean and modern designs. The horrific eyesores won. The people had spoken. And what they said was, well, different.",1366349576

The roll-out delays for what was originally a 100mbps fibre network that is now supposedly going to offer 1gbps speeds conveniently announced right around the time Quigley is about to be grilled in parliament over the delays and so close to an election it looks like Labor will be losing in a landslide.<p>While the prospect of 1gbps speeds sounds great as a developer, the very fact those speeds will only be affordable to businesses at a cost of what looks like could be close to the AUD $200 per month mark initially and no doubt rise with minuscule bandwidth provided for the cost. The reason current Internet offerings in Australia are so expensive is because of the small number of cables that connect us to the rest of the world and monopoly of our limited selection of ISP's, are they planning on laying more deep-sea cables to handle the increased load?<p>Will the high-speeds only apply to Australian content like Optus's fraudulent high-speed 100mbps addon pack promises for cable subscribers which only could promise close to those speeds for Australian content, not content from overseas.<p>On the outside this looks like a Godsend for Australia and while it undoubtedly is in some aspects as we saw with the rise of ADSL in the early 2000's, the project has been poorly managed from the start and this sounds like a stunt more-so than a reality based on what we've seen so far.<p>Having said that, I would be more than happy with 100mbps speeds compared to the 20mbps connection I currently have which costs me $75 per month through Optus Cable.

They should use that opportunity to extract as much value from companies while the situation lasts. When the shoe is on the other foot, that's exactly what the employers will be doing.

If there was a Matrix-like way to jack your users' brains in and explain the full scope of why they should be behaving a particular way in an understandable, absorbable way, I'm all for it.<p>But alas, we can't do brain-downloads. Yet.<p>But what about simply <i>informing</i> them without the messy explanations? Well, it turns out this <i>is</i> what we did in the infancy of consumer websites - and it never worked. ""You should message more users"" falls on deaf ears - even after many, many attempts to reframe the message in more compelling ways.<p>This occurs for many reasons, and differs depending on the exact message being conveyed. For dating sites one persistent trouble is getting your users to upload good photos of themselves. We <i>know</i> from an insane amount of data that people make online dating decisions in a highly visual way, and that anyone without a picture is basically shit out of luck - but yet you wouldn't believe how many users think that rule applies to everyone but themselves. Even explicitly throwing up big warnings about not uploading a photo only convinces a small chunk of users to do it - and in the end you'd resort to tactics like holding their search results hostage until a photo is uploaded. And it works. And it improves <i>their</i> experience dramatically because no one replies to someone who doesn't have a profile picture.<p>I can keep rambling and naming examples like these. There is no shortage here.<p>I don't think you'll find anyone who thinks that hiding your users' data behind a mouse click is the best thing in the world, but you will find many people who have actually been in the trenches, who have done it the ""right"" way, and in the end found that the ""wrong"" way is a necessary (and very minor) evil.<p>You've also made the assertion elsewhere in this thread that people who work on these products don't care about user satisfaction. This is pretty far off the mark - user satisfaction is one of those things that's pretty easy to measure... and the unfortunate truth is that, in most circumstances, the minor loss in satisfaction from having your message hidden behind a link is <i>more</i> than made up for by the overall improvement in experience.<p>It's a somewhat common stance from people who haven't worked in consumer web before to assume that these strategies are the result of arrogant people looking down and disrespecting their user base. The reality is that no one I know assigns any value judgment to any of these observations - but we <i>will</i> follow where the data leads us.",1366348873

Some reasons for this are:<p>1) Large companies typically dedicate more attention to code quality and review process to ensure all of the low-hanging gotchas are covered.<p>2) Larger companies, if not adherents of test-driven development, typically still rely on large suites of unit and integration tests, and continuous deployment, that follows from having all the tests in order.<p>3) Larger companies typically have processes to analyze failures in dev/staging/production, and resources to throw at mitigating those failures in the future.<p>With all that said, there's nothing to prevent small companies from instituting such practices as well, and it's typically the work of the first few senior engineers the startup hires.<p>When you interview with the companies, remember that interview is a 2-way street - you interview them as much as they interview you.

To what extent is that signaling high-status simply because it's a very rude thing to do? Is it implausible that a study might come out one day arguing that picking one's nose or scratching one's arse in front of someone is high-status body language for the reason that it is disrespectful to the other party therefore <i>must</i> signal a confidence in the asymmetry of power?<p>I know it's not quite the same, but certainly as a teacher if my students don't sit ""properly"" on their chairs then I'll make clear that is unacceptable. The older they get, the better they should know, and the harsher I'll be. I've even sent students out of the room for it.<p>In situations where my higher status isn't assumed, the ""calling out"", however, does not have to be verbal.

I can't remember a time when they haven't broken the pose and adjusted their position likewise. Sometimes it might take an uncomfortable moment of silence, but they <i>will</i> break it. Am I adopting higher-status body language than them and they are keeping up? Maybe, but I don't think so - I believe sitting neatly and smartly in response to their pose just makes them (an <i>adult</i>) feel rather silly and they adjust to nullify that feeling. I mean, if you were being interviewed for a job by someone sitting in one of these supposedly ""high-status"" but actually pretty damn rude positions, you wouldn't think the interview had even <i>begun</i> yet, would you?<p>Having read other replies in this thread, perhaps I'm wrong, and this means in monkey times (technical term) I'd be the male who beat up the other male for signaling challenging body language - and I doubt I would have lasted long given repeat trials. However, I don't think of it like that. It is simply a matter of respect and etiquette. <i>I'm</i> not the one lying back on my chair or exposing my crotch. ""Sit properly!""<p>My experience of social-norms is informed by growing up in middle class England and spending a long time living in Japan. I accept that in both cultures signaling deep understanding of what is polite is the higher-level currency of status. In other parts of the world, and for lower social strata, I appreciate it can be very different.<p>Additionally, in the picture I linked, the fact that the first guy is exposing his feet is probably actually more egregious to my sensibilities than his pose. If he were wearing a suit and smart shoes I think I would respect him more and consider the pose acceptable, I suppose in some way ""earned"". As it stands, there's just something very - and I realise I may be about to lose anyone on my side up to this point - ""punchable"" about his face...<p>A final point is that while I find myself in many situations where these displays are considered vulgar, to the point that they counter-signal by betraying a lack of etiquette-knowledge, they do seem to play an important role in the ""game"" of socialising. I instinctively <i>feel</i> like a ""douche"" laying my arm across an empty chair next to me or positioning my legs in a way that suggests what is between them is enormous, yet I'll do it anyway when the situation is right and I'll justify it the same way I would ""show off"" dancing or playing an instrument.

An open source project, a small app, something your parents can use, anything that you either enjoy, try to make it big, or just make the world a better place.""</i><p><i>Most big companies aren't like this</i>. In fact, I can count the number of such companies I know on a single hand and have a finger or two left over. Most startups aren't either, so more accurately <i>most software jobs aren't like this</i>.<p>The blog post seems to be a lament about the shitty quality of startup jobs, but really it's more accurately a lament about the shitty quality of software jobs <i>in general</i>.<p>He wants startups to have good compensation, good environments, and reasonable hours - but most big companies can't pull this off either. Big Corporate software jobs are <i>infamous</i> for low compensation, <i>infamous</i> for being middle-management-infested hellholes, and just as willing to bend hacker culture to its own ends.",1366347735

Life insurance payouts should be set by the <i>liabilities</i> left over when someone dies (i.e. children that still need to be raised).  A person with no dependents doesn't need life insurance (except for funeral expenses), but that doesn't mean orders of magnitude less should be spent to save their life.",1366347684

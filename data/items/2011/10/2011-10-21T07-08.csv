If you still disagree - let me reflect the question: list the fundamental, widely accepted contributions that Apple made to cutting-edge EE/CS research between 1990-2010. And compare that versus NASA, Microsoft, Intel, etc.<p>Apple is like that apocryphal hot girl in high school who got the nerds to do her homework. Due to her popularity - it's almost impossible to question her intelligence without bringing a world of hurt down upon yourself, yet despite her good grades and high social status, she isn't generating very many fundamentally new ideas on her own.",1319183764

3138873,comment,3137555,3137814,3,0,davidw,,,"Being in the Kindle conversion and formatting business, one of the advantages of having such a simple format was that self-published authors can create books that look just like those from major publishing houses.  There's only so much you can do to make something fancy with the current Kindle format.  With more capabilities, we'll likely see people try and do 'fancy' and end up with stuff that's actually not that great looking.<p>The wording of the text regarding 'older readers' is also a bit confusing.  Will material created for KF8 be 'automatically translated'?  Will the tools output two different formats?  I'm curious to see the details.<p>I guess I'll need to order a Fire though, in order to keep up...  I was a bit ambivalent, as I'm not wild about not having the Google stuff, and about the Android fork of an older version.<p>The good stuff: table support currently sucks, and the ability to do a bit more with the formatting will help with things like manuals or textbooks, that currently don't always work well on the Kindle.<p>I am worried, though, that for many people, it will be ""enough rope to hang themselves with"".",1319183621

The growth rate in 2008 was ~5%.<p>More importantly, it looks like it works the other way around. If you are devaluing your currency in half, your GDP in dollars (or whatever means of comparison you use) will be cut in half, not double. This is what your chart is showing. It will be a bigger number in the domestic currency, but then it doesn't mean anything because you are just changing the scale.<p>Anyway, we are arguing over details. The larger point is that the economic policy mandated by the IMF is still largely in place, and whenever the Brazilian government tried to increase government spending, a short growth burst was experienced with a very long bust.<p>Lula gave a 1001 speeches saying that ""they were breaking free from the IMF"", but in the end it is just political bullshit: interest rates are still high and it is the only instrument the Central Bank is able to use to keep inflation under control.

3138771,comment,3137854,3137854,8,0,Derbasti,,,"We are currently using Lua in an embedded system to define user interaction. The embedded application is a rather complex thing with a screen and a few hundred buttons, LEDs, encoders and faders, so user interaction can get messy. It all has to run on a single Blackfin processor.<p>Hence, there are serious memory constraints and processing power is very limited, too. But tell you what: Lua (no jit) does just fine.<p>User interaction is pretty complex. Most buttons have different functionality depending on context. Button presses can result in the screen content changing, LEDs changing, even motorized fader movements... More often than not, several dozens of hardware elements have to updated as a result of a single button press. Implementing all that in C++ would be a mayor pain.<p>We implemented a minimal framework in Lua that just barely looks like an object oriented system. It gets called with updates from the hardware (""Button A has been pressed"") and responds by sending similar messages back (""Move Fader X to position Y""). Wrapping all that in some kind of convenient object system only took about 100 lines of Lua code. Interfacing that with the codebase took about 200 lines of C++ code.<p>We also use Lua to do string processing and value conversion (""display element D wants to display value F, but represent it on a logarithmic scale and convert it to SI units""). Implementing this can be done in something like 20 lines of C++.<p>So, a call into the Lua code will take a couple hundred cycles (yes, we have to count cycles), sometimes even a couple dozen thousand cycles. But for user interaction, that is perfectly fine. Some well-optimized C code could probably do the same thing quite a bit faster, but that would take ages to write and debug. (Plus, the bottleneck is not the Lua code. Loading images from disk, or moving faders takes considerably longer)<p>So, we are really happy with Lua.<p>But where Lua really shines is in its adaptability. The Blackfin does not support double precision math natively but Lua uses double as its standard data type. Well, you only have to change one #define, and Lua uses float instead. The Blackfin does not have an MMU, so we have to do some memory management manually. Well, you only have to change this one function and Lua will be fine with that.",1319180690

Perhaps the most severe issue they report is with embedded or Live CD systems such as routers and diskless clients, for which the bootup state is predictable and the available supply of entropy from the environment may be limited. For a system with non-volatile memory, they recommend saving some state from the RNG at shutdown so that it can be included in the RNG state on the next reboot. In the case of a router for which network traffic represents the primary available source of entropy, they note that saving state across reboots &quot;would require potential attackers to either eavesdrop on all network traffic&quot; from when the router is first put into service, or obtain direct access to the router&#x27;s internal state. This issue, they note, is particularly critical in the case of a wireless router whose network traffic can be captured from a distance, and which may be using the RNG to generate keys for data encryption.</i><p>It shouldn&#x27;t be a religious but an engineering problem. If you manage keep some state between reboots and use it after the next reboot, you&#x27;re making it hard enough for anybody not having the physical access to that state. Then you can also use RdRand to mix it with the output of your stream based on your state, and with other sources of entropy if you have them. If RdRand turns out to be suspicious, you&#x27;re at least much better off than using only hard coded states.<p>Anybody knows if some kind of described state is used now?",1373795876

When you search on Google, they try everything possible to have you search while logged on and save your search history. All this is linked to:<p>your real name, location (Android)<p>maybe credit cards (Google Play, Adwords)<p>emails sent<p>videos watched<p>books read<p>sites visited (Google Analytics, sites visited that serve Adsense, Google hosted jQuery)<p>your private docs (G Drive, Documents)....<p>This is of course to make more money off you, they can charge more money to advertisers, and all this info is ready to be siphoned by Booz Allen and Hamilton employees and to be added to your file.<p>What do they get from DDG?

If he is assassinated, apparently all the documents will be publicly released.<p>Greenwald also mentioned that the totality of what Snowden controls is &quot;enough information to cause more damage to the US government in a minute alone than anyone else has ever had in the history of the United States.&quot; Let&#x27;s assume that&#x27;s not an entirely hyperbolic statement.<p>From the point of view of the Obama Administration, the real threat is not Snowden&#x27;s/Greenwald&#x27;s principled (even patriotic) drip of information, but that an enemy of the US might kill Snowden, and stage it to look like a US op, thus tripping the dead man&#x27;s switch. Snowden has, on his own, made himself a prime target for any sufficiently ambitious US antagonist.<p>And so the US wants Snowden back not only to prosecute him, but also to &quot;protect&quot; him. (Nothing like four years of solitary to keep you safe, comrade.)<p>Until and unless he is granted a pardon or some other form of immunity from prosecution, it seems that Snowden&#x27;s best interest is to stay in the strongest and most secure country he can find.

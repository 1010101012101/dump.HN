Can you explain the discontinuity?  Why is Apple great to work for as a peon, but terrible to work for as a CEO?  Why does extra money paid to a CEO definitely and absolutely result in a better CEO, but extra money paid for employees won't get them better employees?<p>Keep in mind the studies that show highly paid CEOs underperform low-paid ones when you answer.",1314449811

Nothing here was 'new' but rather the same things that have been said in near every other 'Year of desktop Linux!' articles. Replace the post date with any year going back to ~ 2006 and it wouldn't be out of place at all. Also, any writer that is suggesting primetime usage of a Linux distribution and then suggests to use WINE or a VM solution is out of his mind.<p>It's amusing how the writer referenced Ultimate in order to show the apparent high cost of Windows yet how many people actually need Ultimate? Also, his 'success' story in regards to his wife isn't too realistic or at least commonhow many people have a husband who is willing to look for DbxConv (A command app) and do all that work for her.<p>The site itself looks as if it's stuck a few years back. I'm a little disappointed Windows ME wasn't referenced and no use of 'm$'.",1314449600

2931345,comment,2931143,2931268,1,0,Retric,,,"The hard part about understanding this is modeling the position of each pendulum easily.  If you want something that cycles from 0 to 1 and back try: Absolute value of (x mod 2 + 1) note:drop the abs to see direction.  If they all cycle in 60 seconds it's easy to see that any cycle will start over.  At 1/2 the full cycle time they will split into left and right sides etc.  Now, work backward after the fastest ball does 4 cycles you can see something that looks nothing like a sine wave.<p>However, you now need to substitute that position as time into the pendulum equation.  At which point you see the sine wave behavior of sticking near the edges as the ball picks up momentum followed by a fast transverse through the center.  Still, it's not really a sine wave but it's fairly close.  To get a true sine wave all the pendulums would need to be the same length and the balls dropped the same distance but at slightly different times.  However, in the experiment they are close to the same length and distance fallen so it looks about right.",1314448866

Games currently have to pull all sorts of tricks to make the inter-user latency appear not to be present.  They've got good enough that generally you just don't notice.  I think the same thing will happen here, although I admit that nobody's demonstrated that they're capable of surmounting the technical challenge, and I doubt it's as simple as tweaking #defines in the network stack.",1314448751

The last time I used Java, it was done with Ant and Eclipse.  This time around, it appears that Maven is the idiomatic babe, and I've been trying to pick it up, to be current.<p>One of the selling points of Maven, apparently, is that it relies on idiomatic convention.  This means that basically it tries to read your mind and do a lot of magic behind the scenes. It dances with you, but you have to know the right dance steps.<p>Well, let me tell you, after 2 weeks of banging my head against Maven and its sadistic verbosity monster of repository managers, goals, plugins, IDE integrations, and layers of idioms, I'm done.  I've got products to ship, and if it means going back to Ant, then that's what I've got to do.  I cringe when I think of all the code I could have written in that same amount of time.<p>Let the Java-build experts laugh at my poor, ignorant schemes.",1314448451

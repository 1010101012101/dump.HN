Which would be fine with me, but those are the subject of the major traffic on TPB.<p>That's the part I find tremendously disingenuous. All this tall about art--there is a ton of great free or cheap art. Indie movies, music, etc. But people don't want that. They want the high budget entertainment products. Well, it's the copyright system that makes those products viable. Without copyright, you'd have lots of art, but not the kind the torrenters are interested in.",1356886788

At what cost?<p>You can not fight technology, you can not stop it. It is inevitable that information will become free.<p>Luckily, it is now easier than ever to enjoy cross-cultural content in digital form.<p>I am not advocating for a society where one doesn't get paid for the content they provide, but rather for a society where information is free.

2) Alt always used to be bound (it didn't pop up a textbox, it selected the menu), especially in Windows (it might have been different in Gnome, I can't remember now, but I think it wasn't).
3) There's a control panel with all the configuration elements, but yes, compizconfig is a maze, and I don't think it's even installed by default.
4) I find this extremely frustrating too, it's the same on OS X. You open two terminals, you only get one button.
5) Same as OS X again (I don't know why you say it doesn't work like the Mac, when it's exactly the same). Alt+tab switches apps, Alt+` switches windows, like in OS X. I hate it.
6) Yeah, I don't know why they can't bundle Chromium in a PPA by default.<p>Ultimately, we're an entirely different market from regular users. The average ""Linux on the desktop"" user doesn't care about readline shortcuts, or configuration, or pressing the alt key. They want all their programs in a dock, and all my family/friends whom I've switched to Ubuntu (to decrease my support time, and it worked fabulously) swear by it.",1356886546

I agree with @kator's comment that it's totally arbitrary. Maybe, but it's convenient!
Also I'm sharing it here to make myself feel like I'm obligated to someone. :)<p>The full doc would be boring to put here, so here is the tl;dr version:<p>1. Productivity
2. School
3. Fitness<p>Slightly longer version:<p>1. Productivity - primary goal: ""I will be productive and inspired all the time."" Practically, this means wasting less time, doing more personal coding projects, learning new skills, and other things.
My first task in this goal is to finish reading and start implementing GTD.

School (I am a master's degree student) - primary goal: ""I will finish all my course requirements and at least 70% of my thesis research and writing"". (The definition of 70% is ""feels like 70%"".)
Secondary goal: ""My school time will be much more relaxed and awesome than it is currently, and I'll leave more time for side projects, side work, and personal stuff.""<p>3. Fitness - primary goal: ""By the end of 2013 I will be stunningly sexy.""

Many more would do better to just take up a trade, go to a school for that. We'll need plumbers, electricians, and other service-oriented specialists for a long time to come.

4986125,comment,4985853,4985853,39,0,jpolitz,,,"The this keyword is confusing, it's good to see posts clarifying it.  However, while the rule in the post will be right in many cases, this list is incomplete, even for some common usages of this, and might lull folks into a false sense of security:<p>1. ""To the left of the dot"" should be ""to the left of the dot or bracket"".  E.g. o[""foo""]() also passes o as this.<p>2. When you pass callbacks to built-ins like forEach, you can supply a thisArg, and if you don't, this will be bound to undefined (<a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x15.4.4.18"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es5.github.com/#x15.4.4.18</a>).   (EDIT): Copying from cwmma below.  Some callbacks, like setInterval and setTimeout, pass the global object rather than undefined.  I suspect that DOM callbacks tend to use the global object and JS callbacks tend to use undefined, but that's not a blanket statement by any means.<p>3. This isn't purely JS, but when interacting with the DOM, this is also implicitly bound as a DOM element in event listeners.  E.g. document.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log(this); }) will print the document object when you click on the page.  This is quite relevant for any JS web development; if it makes it easier to conceptualize, imagine that the browser is calling a method with the DOM element to the left of the dot.<p>4. When the caller is strict mode code and the function is called without method-call syntax, undefined is passed as the this argument rather than the global object.  You should always use strict mode to avoid accidentally handing the global object around (in strict mode, the ""set to global"" option is skipped in <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x10.4.3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es5.github.com/#x10.4.3</a>).<p>5. When using this at the toplevel (which is allowed), it is bound to the global object even in strict mode (<a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x10.4.1.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es5.github.com/#x10.4.1.1</a>).<p>And a few more esoteric ones:<p>6. In addition to call and apply, Function.prototype.bind() can also change the this parameter of a function, and violate the ""left of the dot or bracket"" rule (<a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x15.3.4.5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es5.github.com/#x15.3.4.5</a>, see boundThis).<p>7. Inside a with() {} block (which you should never use, but we're trying to cover our bases here), this is bound to the object passed to with in the parentheses.<p>8. If a property is a getter or a setter, this is bound to the object to the left of the dot or bracket in the field access or assignment expression.  This actually matches the rule in the post except for the fact that the ""call time"" is implicit; there are no () in the expression o.x, but it may call a getter function for x that passes o as this (<a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x8.12.3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es5.github.com/#x8.12.3</a>).<p>(EDIT): One more doozy:<p>9. The dot and bracket operators implicitly convert primitives like numbers, strings, and booleans to objects, so it's not exactly what's to the left of the dot:<p><pre><code>    Number.prototype.identity = function() { return this; }
    var x = 5
    var x2 = x.identity()
    typeof x2 === 'object' (true!)
    typeof x2 === 'number' (false!)
</code></pre>
You can get the raw primitive if you make the function strict:<p><pre><code>    Number.prototype.identity2 = function() { ""use strict""; return this; }
    var x = 5;
    var maybe_five = x.identity2();
    typeof maybe_five === 'object' (false)
    typeof maybe_five === 'number' (true)

Currently, producers front the initial money (and thus carry the risks and rewards) of the movie. After it's made, I can then decide based on trailers and reviews whether I want to spend money on it. Instead, with the Kickstarter approach, I need to front the money based on some short trailer and description for a movie that may or may not be finished and which I have very little information on whether I'll like the end product. I've mentioned movies here, but it extends to music, TV shows etc. I like the idea of Kickstarter and crowd funding, but I'm a bit too risk averse to fund many things.",1356883202

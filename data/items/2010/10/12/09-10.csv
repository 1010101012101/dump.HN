It should look good, it should work and what text you've got should be readable.<p>But not all websites center around the written word, and user experience is not just reading text on a website.<p>Hint: Less text is better. So good Web Design is to avoid having the problem that 95% of your web design centers around typography or any other single metric.<p>It's the total package that matters and typography is but one (minor) element in there. If it isn't <i>just</i> the right font but it is readable you're already 90% there, the remaining 5% may or may not be important to you.<p>I know great sites that use 'courier' or some other minimalist approach and I know sites that suck that have been designed by the best in the industry, they look great but they're like super nice wrapping on a shitty present.<p>Strike the right balance, don't worry too much about any one factor, especially not typography. After all, the screens we have are direct descendants from the 8x6 dot matrix fonts of not that long ago, the availability of information is what drove this industry, not the availability of high resolution display for typographical purposes.<p>We don't call them graphics displays for nothing, pictures <i>still</i> paint a thousand words.",1286876209

I don't know about other countries but you can buy iTunes credit in every supermarket, petrol station and department store in Australia. That stuff matters. Compare it to the relatively high barrier of Google Checkout.<p>So yes iPhone users spend more but that's at least in part because Apple makes it easy to spend money in the iTunes ecosystem.<p>But iOS has one HUGE thing over Android when it comes to games: consistency of hardware. You cannot understate how important this is.<p>It's not simply a question of different resolutions but Android handsets have different chipsets, CPUs, amounts of memory, OpenGL support and so on.<p>Another massive advantage iOS has is... the iPod Touch. Lots of these have been sold? 100+ million? Lots of these are portable gaming consoles. This is something no other platform has. Parents don't often buy pre-teens phones but they will buy them iPods.<p>Windows Phone 7 <i>might</i> be able to replicate this ecosystem in time.

Jeff Jarvis called it 'revenge on the revenge of the nerds' and this absolutely is. The movie hasn't been released where I live yet, but I've read several interviews with him where he makes statements like this. It's complete nonsense. There is no us and them, no global jocks vs geeks battle being waged here.<p>If anything the cultural conflict is generational; media and communication is changing faster than some people can understand. And Sorkin is one of those that doesn't. He doesn't understand what facebook is for, why people like it, or what Zuckerberg wants. He claims that facebook is just the backdrop of the story he's telling - and movie maybe good as a movie, but it's a fictionalized account, by somebody who doesn't understand what backdrop was all about.<p>Disclaimer: I'm historically a fan of Sorkin's movies, and a vocal critic of Facebook's privacy policies.",1286875784

1782783,comment,1782660,1782660,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Facebook was born during a night of incredibly misogyny. The idea of comparing women to farm animals, and then to each other, based on their looks and then publicly ranking them. It was a revenge stunt, aimed first at the woman who'd most recently broke his heart (who should get some kind of medal for not breaking his head) and then at the entire female population of Harvard.<p>What a bunch of pretentious self important nonsense. Fact is, from age 12 to age 25 or so, both men <i>and</i> women are incredibly superficial and petty and immature in their relations to each other. There's probably a lot of reasons why, but I think one big reason is that young people spend these days spend very little time on things that actually really matter, thus aren't relating to each other on topics that actually matter. So both genders descend into social pettiness pretty quickly and easily in their younger years.<p>Young men and young women both act petty. But these days, it's very fashionable to point out all the sexism... on men's parts. Applause lights go on. ""Yes, fight that evil male sexism!"" It's like, okay, there's a bunch of 20 year olds drinking too much and jockeying for attention and being to mean to each other and then throwing up for all the liquor... neither men nor women at that age seem particularly enlightened to me, but people like to be very grave and serious about ""this horrible sexism among men today."" It's seems like feminism succeeded at all its objectives, but was doing so well that it just kept going. Nowdays any immature male behavior is portrayed as a sign of some deep cultural problems. Immature female behavior? What, no, that doesn't happen. What are you, a sexist or something?<p>Edit: Reply instead of downvoting.

I also wonder to what extent Wall-Mart's stores extend the Apple store? Who's not going to drive the extra dozen miles to the Apple Store? Or are iPads potentially an impulse buy by consumers going through the electronics section.",1286874511

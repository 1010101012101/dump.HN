All current meters are almost as small and mobile and are all perfectly safe and accurate. The only benefit of this is the added visualisation aspect from having the readings on a larger high resolution screen.

When I meet someone I can find out so much about them through Facebook, Twitter, etc. that there seems to be several drawbacks; one is lack of mystery and this goes against the modern 'Know <i>everything</i>' idea. Another is there is the reduced [or modified] learning/getting to know other peoplethe experience of it. There'so much more like inherent impatience in the design and behaviours of apps, people, expectations, etc. now. Someone will quote Thoreau soon, I imagine. ;)<p>I had a look at Strangers for Dinner, neat idea! During uni holidays I might give it a look. It's nice to see an Australian-based startup too!

A musical produced at the ideal level of Q (2.6) was two and a half times more likely to be a commercial success than a musical produced with a low Q (<1.4) or a high Q (>3.2).

4120176,comment,4118378,4118378,2,0,icodestuff,,,"Actually, it is about Mac vs. PC.<p>A bit of history:<p>The classic Mac OS Finder never had a tree view. Heck, for a couple System versions, the file system (MFS) didn't support more than one level of folder hierarchy, so it would have been completely pointless. With HFS in System 4 (IIRC), that changed. Still no tree view though, and I don't think it was until System 6 that there was a list view, and not til System 7 were there disclosure triangles so you could drill down. (fun fact - though on OS X, you can adjust a slider to change icon sizes, back in OS 9, there was also ""Small Icon View"", which used 16x16 icons instead of the traditional 32x32, and put the labels to the side, rather than underneath) Despite a few other miscellaneous additions to the Finder over the years (tab view, At Ease (not really the Finder, but it shipped with certain Mac lines)), for System 7 through OS 9, most folks' file systems weren't that deep or complex. Having a tree view would have been mostly unnecessary and very Windows-like, which was something to avoid back then. There was even some outcry in OS 8 when the system got menus where you didn't have to hold down the mouse button to keep them open.<p>Come at it from the other side, NeXTStep Workspace's primary view was column view. So naturally that was left in the OS X Finder along with icon and list views from classic Mac OS. If tree view has ever been discussed at Apple in the past 15 years (and I wouldn't be surprised if it hasn't), it was almost certainly rejected as a throwback to the old Windows Explorer ca. 1995. Anecdote: in 2008-ish, at WWDC, there was a feedback forum, and while I can't remember what prompted the question, I asked if there were going to be resize handles on all the corners. I actually got boos from the audience and a look of horror from most of the panel, and a straight up ""No. We're not doing that, probably ever. No way."" as an answer. (Years later, I couldn't help but smirk when Lion had resize handles on all corners and edges.) The point is, if something potentially useful has too many associations with Windows, it was (and still is, to some extent) taboo.",1339836412

Previously, the agency had deemed it too problematic for cyclists to carry their bikes up the stairs onto trains, and had allowed bike access only at the 60 heavy rail stations with upper-level, or raised platforms level with the train doors.

In my view when he says that there isn't a Moore's Law for software he is asking why haven't we abstracted software development to the level where we can double our productivity every few years or months.",1339833888

My email is terence (at) siganakis [dot] com if you would like to chat.<p>The R integration stuff is more for the data science crowd.  I feel it would be useful  to have a streamlined way of writing a query to return a subset of a large database and then be able to manipulate it in R as if it were a data frame / matrix.  I am interested in seeing how Julia plays out too.",1339833861

Even if it's not strictly stabler, the ISK reflect a certain amount of wealth that's retained in the virtual economy.<p>Taking another contrived example to make the point obvious, if Eve players basically controlled the equivalent of a trillion dollars, and they all decided to shift half of it to dollars (e.g. Because CCP has decided to print more ISKs), this would have a very real impact on the real economy.<p>Those are all contrived examples, so regulation shouldn't be based on them, but they show the question is worth considering.",1339833630

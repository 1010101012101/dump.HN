As a chess amateur and someone who has played many tournaments both live and online, I can say that online play quality is far superior simply because people can consult chess engines and books and move the pieces about without having to load all the permutations in one's mind.  <p>Just because Kasparov could have beaten Krush face to face easily doesn't mean Krush couldn't have put up an equally impressive battle if they were playing online.  <p>Therefore, the surprising resistance put up by the World Team could have been due to the format (online) rather than collective teamwork.

73602,comment,73519,73568,0,0,chaostheory,,,"I really doubt that considering:
 
1) even if Nintendo lowers the price of their console, they still profit from the sale of each one; both MS and Sony still lose money on every sale of their consoles<p>2) game development on Wii (and DS) is much cheaper than 360 or PS3. Not to mention sales are great on Wii. Ubisoft made a killing last holiday season on the Wii. Publishers like EA that put their bets on Sony and MS didn't post phenomenal sales and profit in the same quarter. Publishers are now shifting their focus on the Wii. Consequently the Wii will probably have the biggest library (something that made PS2 king).<p>3) based on current growth rates, the Wii is already dominating 360 and PS3; Nintendo already has the mindshare of normal people which normally don't play games<p>Nintendo has already eaten both MS and Sony's lunch (especially Sony's)<p>maybe in the next war MS will be able to dominate (they have improved afterall - except for the hardware problems)... but they won't in the current one",1193622412

73598,comment,73582,73588,0,0,henning,,,"I don't understand this reluctance to share an idea for a startup. It's ridiculous, because it seems to be predicated upon the assumptions that no one has thought of it, and if they did they would go off and immediately implement it. What arrogance. You could tell them every little detail of what you have and mind and, because language is so vague, they could think it was something entirely different.<p>If you tell me about your startup, your first goal, before you can make me a user or (even better) a paying user, is to get me to give a shit about it, which is a formidable task.",1193620942

Set up some feedback loops to control the sending rate but as long as the percentage of lost packets is below some threshold the receiving end can still unpack everything.

7773662,comment,7772753,7772753,4,0,towlesda,,,"My job tried that the first few years I worked there and it was a nightmare.  Yes, as a developer I knew the software better than anyone else and could provide quick and effective support, but it was detrimental to my coding.  For example I&#x27;d be in the middle of thinking through a process and get a phone call and the call would completely take me out of the mindset of the problem at hand, since I&#x27;d have to focus on the customer.  After that it would take many minutes of reading through code or looking at diagrams to get back into the mindset of the problem, what happens then if I get another call; the process starts over again.  In addition to the time spent on the phone, many calls can easily be an additional 15 minute time sink.<p>I wasn&#x27;t the only developer who felt this way and after enough complaints from almost every developer they changed the policy to have support and development separate (with the developers being available to help with support problems, but only after support attempts the problem first).  I don&#x27;t see any reason to ever disrupt development for a trivial problem, there are better hires for that.",1400605160

Because creating the pipes (the water, the subway, the electric, the networking) are all prohibitively expensive to try to compete in, require deep intervention of states (which rarely doesn&#x27;t result in market dilution) and are naturally a common good because unused bandwidth - in roads, in power line voltage, in pipe flow - are wasted potential, and duplicating the effort and having all the lost potential as a result can be, and <i>is</i> devastating to economies.",1400605158

Also Level 3 claims they can get the packets all the way to the cross connect between their network and the ISP&#x27;s and they have extra capacity at the cross connect, but the ISP&#x27;s refuse to upgrade their side of the cross connect (IE the part that turns them from a network provider to an Internet provider.)",1400605135
7773659,comment,7773036,7773436,1,0,talmand,,,"I would think there are few comparisons because in the long run the idea is not logical and few would agree to such an arrangement unless they were forced to. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but it&#x27;s not always a sound business model. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great when you can make it happen but it would be easy to disrupt by a competitor.<p>It would be the equivalent of a third-party delivery service charging the buyer a fee to deliver and the seller a fee to deliver the same purchased item with their delivery trucks.<p>Now, some may do that; but it would be easy for a competitor to see the consumer unfriendliness of such a practice to step up and say &quot;we only charge once per delivery!&quot;. That would likely be the end of the Double-Dipping Delivery Service because both the buyer and seller would be better off with this new service.<p>But that&#x27;s the key, many of these ISPs don&#x27;t have competition so they can try to enforce such a consumer unfriendly practice.<p>The question is whether am I paying to have bits delivered that I request or am I paying to have access to the Internet so that bits can be delivered to me if I request them? Based on the sales pitch and pricing from my ISP, it is clear to me I&#x27;m paying to have bits delivered.<p>If the ISPs will lower my pricing to be a connection and then charge companies to deliver bits to me, then that&#x27;s something different. There would have to be some financial agreement between me and that company as to how to cover that cost. That could either be a direct payment transaction or I have to watch ads to cover their costs.<p>Netflix could charge me $20 a month if my high-speed connection was $5 a month, or even free, since they charge Netflix a nominal fee to deliver bits to me.<p>As far as I know, no ISP has ever sold Internet connections that way. So for them to claim that both parties need to be charged for bits delivered is attempting to double charge on a bill of goods already sold. The argument is more like, &quot;Somebody already paid for it!&quot; and is quite valid.<p>Your magazine example fails because the ads conceivably subsidize the cost of delivering the magazine to me. Without the ads, my pricing for the magazine would be higher. To be accurate to the argument, the magazine would need to charge full price for ads and not subsidize the cost of getting the magazine to me at all, charging me full price as well.",1400605125

In each case, in American history (though I don&#x27;t know about water), the utility was privatized for _years_, became local monopolies, and used that monopolistic advantage to become one of the most major Washington lobbying industries of the time, often to the massive detriment to specific sections of the economy.  In each case it was only _after_ an alternative industry rose in lobbying prominence in washington (often, the next one on your list) that the previous utility lost their position as #1 lobbying firm in Washington, that their competitors were able to then force anti-trust lawsuits, and or get fair government regulation.<p>The railroads were monopolized until the late 1800s, the original American idea of a fat cat comes from railroad owners who made profits at the expense of midwestern farmers.  That was eventually regulated when oil became a major lobbying industry, whereupon oil and gas subsidies became the new norm and we regulated the railroads.  Electricity is a general complex area, but outside of domestic coal-based electricity production, my understanding is that the majority(?) of American electricity comes from nuclear power, which in turn is a regulated monopoly.  That industry is so locked that Northern America imports much of its electricity from nuclear plants in Canada, and Texas is actually on Mexico&#x27;s electricity grid.<p>I was somewhat hopeful that as Wallstreet rose to replace other industries as one of the top lobbying firms in America that they would end up pushing for net neutrality so as to commoditize their network costs, but instead they simply pushed for B2B fiber to be regulated completely differently (and more sanely) than consumer networks.<p>I don&#x27;t want to wait for something better than the internet to come around, before we get net neutrality back.",1400604732

The cable distribution giants like Time Warner Cable and Comcast are already making a 97 percent margin on their “almost comically profitable” Internet services, according to Craig Moffet, an analyst at the Wall Street firm Bernstein Research. As Levin points out, “If you are making that kind of margin, it’s hard to improve it.” And most Americans have no choice but to deal with their local cable company.<p>-- <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/510176/when-will-the-rest-of-us-get-google-fiber/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/510176/when-will-the-re...</a><p>If that&#x27;s accurate, I suspect that they could live without cable as we know it today and still make plenty of money. Working on finding out more numbers to see what the revenue breakdown is between cable and internet, though I wouldn&#x27;t mind if someone else chimed in.<p>EDIT: Found this [1] for Comcast. For 2012 and 2013 they&#x27;ve lost video customers, increased internet customers. Had growth in revenue for both categories, but a greater increase from internet (percentage and absolute).<p>So the way things are heading, cable leaving would cost them a lot. However, they can probably make up for it elsewhere, and, ultimately, should be planning on cable TV going the way of the dodo regardless of the nearterm revenues and profits. It&#x27;s not a viable longterm strategy, like SMS (while immensely profitable) for cell carriers, a good short term strategy but as content shifts to the generic data channels the specialized channels will fall into disuse.<p>[1] <a href=""http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/CMCSA/3182774232x0xS1193125-14-47522/1166691/filing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/CMCSA/3182774232x0xS1...</a><p>EDIT 2: Check out page 53 of the linked filing.<p>Video revenue for 2013 was $20.5 billion. Programming costs were $9.1 billion. So the net, ignoring any other costs, right there is $10.4 billion. If the ISP side of the house is actually making 97% margins like the claim in the Technology Review article, then it is making almost as much as the video side of the house. At the current growth rates it&#x27;ll surpass the video profit, but not revenue, sometime in the next few years. Their NBCUniversal acquisition may reduce their programming costs, I&#x27;m not sure of the legalities involved in that (their growth and acquisitions could put them afoul of anti-trust/monopoly laws and regulations).",1400604621

The traffic out through the link from LazyISP is generating more traffic in through the link than the pipe can handle.  LazyISP pretends that this is not their problem, that the Internet is somehow trying to shove its traffic through poor ol&#x27; LazyISP&#x27;s pipes.<p>The claim is analogous to traffic exiting a Autobahn-style limited-access highway and attempting to reach its destination faster by taking the narrow country backroads to get to the on-ramp of the next highway.  The only real reason for any traffic to route to LazyISP is if one of the endpoints is in there, and there is seldom a reason for that traffic to go anywhere but the shortest route between the end point and the nearest backbone highway access point.<p>The typical argument from LazyISP is so ridiculous on its face that it makes me furious every time I see it.  All of those guys present asymmetric upload and download speed to residential customers.  Every last one of them.  And they pretend that when all of their customers&#x27; asymmetric bandwidths are summed up, the total is somehow magically supposed to be symmetric.<p>Every business on the planet whose cash flow depends on pushing bits out to the Internet goes directly to the backbone with content delivery networks, or at least to an ISP that is serious about peering.  They are not going to an ISP with crappy interconnects.  There is no way in hell that any cul-de-sac on the network map like a last-mile ISP is <i>ever</i> going to push as many bits to the backbone network as it pulls from it, especially when they do nasty tricks like throttling, port blocking, and hidden metering.<p>The point is that a steaming pile like Time Warner does not have any internal content providers that any of its customers want to connect to, precisely because of its business practices.  If Time Warner cannot connect to the Internet, it has nothing to offer the customer through that precious last mile connection except television channels.  So they stop paying the $25-150 a month and try to make do with standing on a ridge waving semaphore flags at each other.  LazyISP needs Level 3 more than Level 3 needs them.<p>Therefore, when LazyISP tries to extort them, the correct response should be, &quot;Fuck you,&quot; as they flip the off switch.",1400604546

What does it translate to in more tangible terms? Refuse to go to school/seek a better job/invest in something more worth one&#x27;s time in wait for an unexpected propulsion to the top of a hill?<p>I agree that the hills are rather unstable and various unaccounted for factors can cause the searching algorithm to fail. Most often being that we fail to account for all the other dimensions which also have hills that somehow need attention. One dimension is profits and it is a very popular hill, but all of a sudden you hit a point and realize that there exists a hill in health, and relationship, and personal growth, etc.<p>What do we do as a response? Stop searching? I doubt it. It might be better to instead, accept the fact that our algorithm will never provide the perfect solution; that to optimize for one dimension (income, for example), we will have to sacrifice optimizations in other dimensions (relationships, leisure etc.) due to a finite resources and constraints outside our control, and in doing that, define priorities.<p>The priorities need not be final values, but mutable based on environmental conditions.

Wage growth is very modest for almost every category of STEM worker as well.&quot;<p>The demand for STEM work is dwarfed by the supply, so wages are stagnant and thus losing ground relative to the rapidly rising cost of living. STEM work has this in common with most other sectors of the economy.<p>The real kick in the head is that getting a STEM degree and STEM experience is significantly more demanding than other degrees.<p>The other kick in the head is all the Wall Street types claiming there&#x27;s a STEM shortage. There&#x27;s no shortage, they just want to be able to pay each worker even less, and need to maintain the illusion of a shortage in order to procure cheap foreign labor legally. If there were a real shortage, domestic STEM wages would be rising meteorically in order to incentivize people to re-train. There&#x27;s been no such rise.<p>This entire phenomenon kind of destroys the argument of the &quot;you&#x27;re unemployed, why didn&#x27;t you STEM&quot; folks.

Wikipedia probably has more of an ability to propagate inaccuracies by virtue of it generally being <i>better</i> in several ways!<p>There&#x27;s more to say about it than this, it would require some actual investigation and research and thinking. I think there&#x27;s plenty of interesting compare and contrast to be done along those lines beyond just saying &quot;Yeah, but errors in Britannica probably ended up accepted as fact too&quot;, although that&#x27;s probably true and a good start.

This is the net neutrality law we need: ISPs should be compelled to upgrade their backbone links as they become congested, to satisfy their customer&#x27;s demand. Congestion can be easily monitored and often these peerings are &quot;free&quot;. (Yes there is a non-zero cost to increase switch and router capacity and to have someone plug the cables in, but it&#x27;s not like Level3 is charging for the bits exchanged.)

7773282,comment,7773036,7773036,12,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Somebody has to pay the money to upgrade the equipment and bandwidth available at these exchange points.  The very reasonable argument in this article is that the ISPs should pay that cost, which seems reasonable given that their customers are demanding it.  It sounds like the ISPs are playing a game of chicken, trying to see if their peers like Level3 will throw money in to pay for the ISP to upgrade its equipment and bandwidth.  That&#x27;s certainly something the ISPs can try to do; on the other hand, what are their customers going to do, <i>not</i> use Netflix and YouTube?  If a pile of customers of one ISP start reporting that they&#x27;re all having a poor experience with high-bandwidth video, and there are a pile of well-publicized press releases blaming the ISP, customers will start complaining to the ISP, and they&#x27;ll have to upgrade their infrastructure eventually.  (And in areas where they have competition, there&#x27;s an incentive to upgrade before the competitors, to avoid losing customers; while there isn&#x27;t such competition in every locale, there are enough locales with more than one ISP choice to make those customers painful to lose.)<p>But what does any of that have to do with mandated peering requirements at the NSFnet exchanges?  Who would enforce that, and why, when any two major networks can set up peering at any number of meet-me rooms?  Requiring that an ISP peer as much traffic as is available or not peer any at all seems ridiculous; some ISPs will suck more than others, but that&#x27;s the problem of them and their customers, not a problem for the entire Internet.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;m surprised there aren&#x27;t more startups and VCs looking to bet that &quot;new ISP that doesn&#x27;t suck&quot; is a viable business model.  People are chomping at the bit for Google Fiber, which seems unlikely to grow to a national level without developing competitors.  This is a space with very few competitors, and there hasn&#x27;t been serious competition in that space since DSL stopped being a viable option.",1400601711

Google still does a better job seemingly &quot;understanding&quot; queries sometimes, so occasionally I go over there, but I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m only doing that about 5% of the time.<p>One of my favorite things about DDG is that I do not have to worry about &quot;search bubbles.&quot; I don&#x27;t have to worry that DDG is profiling me and de-prioritizing results it doesn&#x27;t &quot;think&quot; I would want to see. I know Google thinks search bubbles are a feature but I think they&#x27;re a bug. I don&#x27;t want some algorithm trying to reinforce cognitive biases for me so I don&#x27;t experience the shock of a dissenting opinion. I&#x27;ve observed a few times that DDG seems to do a better job finding really obscure things, and I&#x27;ve wondered if this might somehow be related to profiling algorithms or lack thereof.<p>I also find the level of data mining Google (and Facebook) engage in to be creepy, invasive, and to hold a high potential for abuse. I&#x27;m certainly open to alternatives whose business model does not revolve around that kind of intrusive personal profiling. I&#x27;m aware that DDG does have an ad-and-analytics business model, but they seem to be taking the high road with it.<p>Prediction: &quot;privacy is dead&quot; will in the future be regarded as an idea that greatly harmed several multi-billion-dollar companies.

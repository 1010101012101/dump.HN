The recession messed with a lot of energy and consumption so that the years from 2008-2012 or so are something of anomalies.<p>3. There have been significant rollbacks and cuts to getting datasets complete. It used to be we were only a year or two behind in lots of the published federal data. I&#x27;ve found it to be far more scattershot today, and sometimes just cross my fingers and hope they have managed to stay up to date. That said, the EIA has mostly managed to stay on top of their annual publications.<p>4. Natural gas prices bottomed out a couple years ago, and we&#x27;ll have a glut of it for a while, keeping prices much lower than they were in the early 2000s.<p>5. Coal plants are getting replaced with natural gas combined cycle because of the fuel costs, and also because of new regulations on the new MATS stuff (also in the link above).<p>6. &quot;Clean&quot; coal has mostly been a bust. Duke Indiana&#x27;s been trying to get their gasification plant to full capacity for a while, and cost ovverruns has resulted in them asking for rate increases. Also, carbon capture still isn&#x27;t up to snuff, and underground gasification never took off.",1401667178

Of course, each group needs to be able to understand the position of the other to be useful.  I&#x27;m worthless as a developer if I have no empathy towards for the customer (i.e. I shouldn&#x27;t say &quot;we&#x27;re not going to implement this feature that would be useful to customers because it&#x27;s too hard&quot;), and PMs are useless if they don&#x27;t understand the technical constraints of the existing code/infrastructure.<p>I&#x27;d say that PMs are less technical than developers, so developers can do the PM work if necessary (and should be thinking about it a little bit even if there are good PMs).<p>Project/Program Managers are different.  Their job is more focused on making sure all the moving parts of a &quot;project&quot; are coordinated.  When it&#x27;s a small start up there aren&#x27;t as many moving parts, so it&#x27;s not a useful role - but in bigger companies it&#x27;s useful to have someone coordinate between marketing, legal, finance, customer service, etc.  And they can make sure everything happens on time.<p>You run into problems when developers don&#x27;t care at all about customers, product managers have no sense of what&#x27;s technically possible or reasonable, and project managers get too hung up on the process and not the final result.

7831072,comment,7830950,7830950,6,0,CHY872,,,"Ok, so one thing that is bugging me: This is totally a software based problem. At the moment, if I have a big hard disk I&#x27;m almost certainly going to have some kind of big read error in at least a couple of sectors - which practically means that I&#x27;ll get some garbled bytes on some reads, and I hope that they&#x27;re in a cache file, or swap file, and not my registry, or programs, etc.<p>So here, they&#x27;re saying that if you have a RAID 5, and one disk fails, then when it has such an error, it&#x27;s suddenly game over for the entire array - the rest of the data on the drive must be copied to a new array, because the firmware says so. Apparently that&#x27;s why RAID 5 is a bad idea.<p>Surely the same argument can be applied to hard drives on their own? If Windows checksummed every file before using it, and forced copying every byte onto a new hard drive whenever an error was found, hard drives themselves would stop working as a meaningful method of storage in 2009. But it doesn&#x27;t, you (likely) get some garbled text, and it&#x27;s usually not a problem. File systems get corrupted etc etc (unless you use something like ZFS), and RAID 5 handling it in a particularly non-graceful way is just an implementation detail.<p>So really, this is just a problem with the controller firmwares forcing you to make a whole new array. It&#x27;s not a problem with RAID 5.<p>Or have I missed something?<p>I know that RAID 5&#x27;s not a good choice in this modern age (cloud, big SANs etc, SSDs etc), but surely the &#x27;a sector will be bad, and you will not be able to rebuild after a failure&#x27; problem would be easily fixed by the raid controller company if their clients complained enough?",1401664682

You can get rid of &#x27;PMs&#x27; but you can&#x27;t get rid of the need to set strategy / vision, understand the customer problem, identify solutions, collaborate with design and corral the rest of the organization (marketing, sales, support, operations) to bring it all together. If you don&#x27;t have a PM performing those functions, then a member of the engineering team needs to step up, or perhaps someone from the executive team. But then guess what... that person is doing the things that PMs do, so I guess you might start calling them a PM...? Or a &#x27;Product Editor&#x27;... or &#x27;Program Manager&#x27;. All just names for something pretty similar.<p>When organizations are small enough, the whole team performs those functions together. As you grow it makes sense to have someone double down and own those responsibilities. Though this doesn&#x27;t absolve engineers of the need to understand customers and help paint the product vision.<p>Perhaps the better question is &#x27;Where did all the non-technical-purely-business-MBA PMs go?&#x27;<p>The answer is that it is likely a disappearing breed. An MBA won&#x27;t teach you how to build great software or lead technology teams, so it&#x27;s foolish to believe that someone with such credentials would be a natural fit to come lead a software organization. Good PMs I&#x27;ve worked with can have a conversation about the technology stack as easily as they can debate a marketing strategy. Great PMs these days need to span the entire &#x27;company stack&#x27; if that makes sense.<p>Lastly, if you don&#x27;t know why a given role exists, then it&#x27;s probably because you haven&#x27;t worked with someone great in that role. There are a number of roles in tech companies I found less useful until I met someone who had mastered the craft - when I saw them in action, it became clear why the role existed and how they could perform a certain function infinitely better than I.<p>As a last thought, I worked at Intuit a while back and I&#x27;m not sure they are a &#x27;shining star&#x27; of PM training. They have done a good job of &#x27;marketing&#x27; themselves that way, and they are an example of a company that typically has &#x27;less technical&#x27; PMs in their organization. This is because Intuit is more of a &#x27;marketing / business&#x27; driven organization. This contrasts with Google who is known to favor promoting engineers into the PM role. Neither model is 100% - the ideal is probably somewhere in between.",1401664363

You&#x27;re still protecting the same 6 TB (at a small loss of efficiency), but eventually cost catches up (if 4 x 2TB isn&#x27;t immediately cheaper than 7 x 1TB it won&#x27;t take long till it is). This more than covers the reliability decrease of the higher capacity drives.",1401663629

Also every year storage costs continue to drop. Double parity, or eventually triple parity are cheaper than ever to implement.",1401663609

Ruby stores all of its data types using a single underlying C data type (called VALUE in the Ruby source), using the bottom two bits to identify special values that aren&#x27;t really pointers.  This is why Fixnum can only hold 31 or 63 bits instead of 32 or 64 (including sign), for example:<p><pre><code>    # Ruby irb on a 32-bit system\n    > (1<<30 - 1).class\n    => Fixnum\n    > (1<<30).class\n    => Bignum\n</code></pre>\nSee also:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer</a>",1401663602

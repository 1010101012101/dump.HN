This could be examined at length but the fact that chess was used as one of the weapons of Cold War and its long history (Go has become popular in the West only in late 20th century) all should be considered. Yet, there might be <i>some</i> truth to Nicholai's (aka Trevanian, aka Whitaker) observation. The antagonistic nature of chess is much easier to grasp than the cold, crystalline-like beauty of Go's patterns.<p>As to your comment "" I don't actually think humans really were bested by computers in chess"", which is shared by others on this thread: The observations that computers play ""ugly chess"", the ""thought"" process is different, etc. stem from an romantic idealization of how the grandmasters are raised and train nowadays. I would very much suggest that you read the NYer article I linked (an another commentor summarized).

While it's true that chess has an absurd amount of possible moves, combinations, and games, computers are showing us that chess strategy and theory are essentially meaningless in the face of brute calculational ability. From a poetic point of view, you could argue that computers are sucking the mysticism and romance out of the game. From a practical point of view, you could argue that computers are steadily making the game pointless for humans. Either way, it's a less exciting game now that it's been reduced.<p>Kasparov seems to be an optimist, for what it's worth, and in several of his disquisitions on this topic, he argues that a computer program will never ""solve"" chess the way a program solved checkers a few years ago. There are too many numbers to crunch. Furthermore, there are too many weaknesses in AI's ability to form strategies or think creatively. Unfortunately, this line of reasoning assumes that creativity is necessary for success in chess. It might be in a human-vs-human game, but in absolute terms, evidently it's not.",1305754989

As another commenter pointed out you did allude to the Android UI being more like a scalable interface you don't always have control over but sometimes we still have to use pixel perfect designs, even on the web. For using the standard UI elements it makes sense to fit in with a scalable design but I've thought at length about games and how that would work across different resolutions without being able to rely on using high and low res graphics. iOS gives me a lot of crutches to just know what systems I have to support and the shear variety of screens and systems gives me a lot of pause for the layout or number of versions I'll have to package up.<p>Honestly I should be researching this myself, I just got excited when the topic came up in your article and was sad to see that it didn't answer my every question I've been mulling over for some months now.

Back in 1986, scientists used electron microscopy to painstakingly map its roughly 6000 chemical synapses and its complete wiring diagram. Yet more than two decades later, there is still no working model of how this minimal nervous system functions.<p>Now scale that up to a human brain with its 100 billion or so neurons and a couple hundred trillion synapses. Tracing all those synapses one by one is close to impossible, and it is not even clear whether it would be particularly useful, because the brain is astoundingly plastic, and the connection strengths of synapses are in constant flux. Simulating such a gigantic neural network model in the hope of seeing consciousness emerge, with millions of parameters whose values are only vaguely known, will not happen in the foreseeable future.""",1305754362

Somehow, it kills the vibe to know that computers will always win.<p>Funny, humans still enjoy sports even though a human sprinter will never run as fast as a motorcycle.  Maybe it's because we've always been physically less capable than animals, maybe it hurts more to be bested intellectually.  Horses have always run faster than us, so we're primed to see the motorcycle as a tool rather than a challenge.  In sports, maybe we're better at celebrating human achievement without comparing it to something else.<p>Like most people, I don't actually think humans really were bested by computers in chess.  There is a huge difference, of course - the computers are winning by following a completely different ""thought"" process than a human.  It's an astoundingly impressive accomplishment to build a program that can beat chess masters, but because the way a human plays is so different, I think that I understand what the calculator analogy is getting at.  In some ways, the ""victory"" shows the severe limitations of computers - a human chess grandmaster, capable of holding and evaluating maybe a dozen positions, is capable of playing evenly with a computer that evaluates hundreds of millions of positions a second.  And in Go, that dozen or so positions combined with intuition, strategy, and other mental processes we consider almost subjective is so effective that a billions of positions a second computer can't even come close to winning.<p>If go eventually falls because computers are now capable of evaluating trillions of moves per second, but the approach is still essentially number crunching, well that's an impressive engineering feat, but ""human intelligence"" won't be any more defeated than it was the first time, with chess.<p>Now, if a computer can beat a human by evaluating <i>fewer</i> moves, ok, maybe then we've been bested.",1305754221

It's pretty standard practice to only ask for an email address to initiate a password reset. Google, for example, only asks for email address. Asking for additional information, like DOB, isn't really a security measure. It's more of an annoyance prevention measure, to make it slightly harder for random people to initiate password resets in your name.<p>The problem with what Sony was doing is that you could circumvent the verification that you had access to the email address you gave. The way it is supposed to work is that you initiate a password reset, and the site sends you a link that you have to follow to get to the form where the actual password reset takes place and you enter a new password.<p>The security comes not from knowing your email address and DOB, but rather from having to actually have access to the email.<p>The way Sony's site was working, when you initiated the reset request it was possible to figure out what the link was that sent in the email, and hence finish the reset process without having access to the email.

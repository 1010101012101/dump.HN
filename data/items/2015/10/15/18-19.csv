You have to use hacks even for this simple purpose.<p>- Building grids? Let&#x27;s have fun and pick the one you prefer : html tables, display table, floats, flexbox, css grids...<p>- About Tables: 15 years ago everybody switche to tabless layouts for the purpose of separating markup from presentation. A few years later we got access to the table display mode in CSS because, well, not a single one from the other solution worked well to build layout. Qo we got offered the option to emulate html tables in CSS.<p>- They added CSS animations. What animations have to do with styling and layout? Oh it&#x27;s to compensate the bad performances we got when animating things with JS.<p>Etc, etc, etc. CSS is just a complete mess.",1444934414

Rice is a terrible human being and a seasoned deceiver of the public.

She&#x27;s barely a part of the leadership and may have almost no say in what the company does. The ultimate decisions are probably still in the hands of the executive team. That&#x27;s why I was a customer until very recently.<p>All that said, I don&#x27;t understand how Rice is valuable enough to counterbalance the bad PR from the tech community. Tech-y people get small companies to adopt certain brands over others, and then those small companies grow into large companies.

Maybe lacking a few billionaires and some minor trickle down economic benefits, but by and large, regular people in US would still be as innovative, productive and successful as ever.<p>So if US had never bombed a number of countries or organized a number of coups or ended sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Russia tomorrow, the average American would hardly feel the difference or be any more threatened. But unfortunately political power in the US is not controlled by average citizens.",1444934006

At the time, we had a budget of 20K gzipped for the entire search results page.  I remember working on the visual redesign of 2010, where we had increased the page weight from 16K to 19K and there was much handwringing at the higher levels about how we were going to blow our <i>entire</i> latency budget on one change.<p>We did some crazy stuff to squeeze everything in.  We would literally count bytes on every change - one engineer wrote a tool that would run against your changelist demo server and output the difference in gzipped size of it.  We used &#x27;for(var i=0,e;e=arr[i++];) { ... }&#x27; as our default foreach loop because it was one character shorter than explicitly incrementing the loop counter.  All HTML tags that could be left unterminated were, and all attributes that could be unquoted were.  CSS classnames were manually named with 1-3 character abbreviations, with a dictionary elsewhere, to save on bytesize.  I ran an experiment to see if we could use JQuery on the SRP (everything was done in raw vanilla JS), and the results were that it <i>doubled</i> the byte size and latency of the SRP, so that was a complete non-starter.  At one point I had to do a CSS transition on an element that didn&#x27;t exist in the HTML, because it was too heavy and so we had to pull it over via AJAX, so I had to do all sorts of crazy contortions to predict the height and position of revealed elements before the code for them actually existed on the client.<p>A lot of these convolutions should&#x27;ve been done by compiler, and indeed, a lot were moved to one when we got an HTML-aware templating language.  But it gave me a real appreciation for how to write tight, efficient code under constraints - real engineering, not just slapping libraries together.<p>Alas, when I left the SRP was about 350K, which is atrocious.

We&#x27;re already ~5 years ahead of the curve. The failure scenarios are very safe (I&#x27;m using Tesla&#x27;s titanium plate armored pack as the example) compared to a Hydrogen storage failure. Could charging happen faster? Sure. But needing a ~5-10 minute turnaround on your vehicle&#x27;s fueling is an edge case; the vast majority of owners are going to charge at home overnight, at their workplace, or at Superchargers (or other non-Tesla high current charging stations).<p>Hydrogen is dead on arrival for mobility.",1444933642

And the argument I&#x27;m making is that they are NOT mutually exclusive. A lot of people seem to be taking the road of logic implying that taking conscious actions in increasing women&#x27;s participation in tech will not get engineering done. I am contesting the logic behind that.<p>>Regardless of whether or not gender studies departments are responsible for reducing female STEM majors, women prefer working with people rather than things<p>As someone else pointed out in the thread, the women participation in tech has actually gone down. Now, you can argue women have actually gotten MORE people friendlier, but then I&#x27;d go back to my original point: what was in tech that drove them away?<p>I&#x27;ll restate my general position once more: this is not a liberal wishy-washy &#x27;ooh lets make all equal&#x27; argument. Diversity in tech is diversity in thought process, diversity in approaches to solutions, more resistant to specific types of failures. Just like you wouldn&#x27;t want monoculture forests or crops, you don&#x27;t want mono-culture engineers. I&#x27;d go one step further: even IF hiring women costs you quite reasonably in terms of &#x27;efficiency&#x27; originally (measured by LOC&#x27;s I guess? How do y&#x27;all do that?), your returns will be much higher in terms of longer term gain.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll bite my words a bit. Above is necessary only if you want to (or want to pretend to) care about the long-term future of your company and environment for your employees.

It shifts in response to elite opinion, media coverage, how poll questions are asked, and no doubt other things. It is as much an effect as a cause of the forces that shift policy; only in dramatic cases does it become causal. Appealing to public opinion to predict that the status quo will persist is therefore a historical fallacy.<p>There&#x27;s an example of this in Boswell&#x27;s Life of Johnson. Here is Johnson, the great English Tory, arguing in 1769 that general warrants are a non-issue because the public doesn&#x27;t care:<p><i>[Johnson] would not admit the importance of the question concerning the legality of general warrants. &quot;Such a power (he observed) must be vested in every government to answer particular cases of necessity; and there can be no just complaint but when it is abused, for which those who administer government must be answerable. It is a matter of such indifference, a matter about which the people care so very little, that were a man to be sent over Britain to offer them an exemption for it at a halfpenny a piece, very few would purchase it.&quot; This was a specimen of that laxity of talking, which I had heard him fairly acknowledge; for surely, while the power of granting general warrants was supposed to be legal, and the apprehension of them hung over our heads, we did not possess that security of freedom, congenial to our happy constitution, and which, by the intrepid exertions of Mr. Wilkes [1], has been happily established.</i> [2]<p>It&#x27;s striking how modern Johnson&#x27;s arguments about general warrants—the mass surveillance issue of his time—sound now. He was probably correct about the public and could have cited polls had they existed. Yet that was far from dispositive: the American Revolution was imminent, and to Boswell, writing 20 years later, it is so obvious that Johnson was on the wrong side of history that he hastens to make clear that <i>he</i> (Boswell) wasn&#x27;t.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkes</a><p>2. <a href=""https://books.google.ca/books?id=qBFXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq=%22he+would+not+admit+the+importance%22+general+warrants&source=bl&ots=s3ZsrSfApC&sig=G8ueW1Vbu3k4vWZO-BWqsXOh_IE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAWoVChMIpfOhjYPFyAIVj5WICh19FA7V#v=onepage&q=%22he%20would%20not%20admit%20the%20importance%22%20general%20warrants&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.ca/books?id=qBFXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA255&lpg=P...</a><p>p.s.

With screen color, you have only one finish, and that&#x27;s whatever the user&#x27;s monitor happens to have. With paints and plastics the finish (how glossy the surface is, how metallic it is, coated or uncoated, inclusions like metal flake, etc) really messes things up.

It is also dangerous, since nontechnical users lose their private keys with startling frequency, and it&#x27;s difficult to explain to them that we&#x27;re completely unable to help them when this happens.<p>We do, however, totally know there is a small slice of technical users that want to treat Dropbox as an opaque &quot;backup service&quot;, and they&#x27;re willing to take on the risk of key management.  So we refer them to one of our partners that specializes in providing this layer on top of Dropbox.<p>Never say never, so we may decide to offer this type of account in the future--possibly to businesses.  We would have to alter or disable large swaths of collaboration features that require server-side representations/alterations of data. But, as I said, it&#x27;s a product feature under constant consideration.<p>2.<p>Once again, I have to emphasize, this is a personal take, not Dropbox&#x27;s take.<p>I sympathize with the tinfoil hat crowd, but I think most Dropbox employees find it a disappointing take on the company that has always strived to make the very best cloud storage product possible, on all platforms.<p>We are in a segment (cloud sync/collab, not backup) with some very, very large players.  Storage is not a loss leader to us.  It is not subsidized by a massive advertising network capitalizing on customer behavioral data.  Our customers are not what&#x27;s for sale--our storage services are.<p>If you or your business does not like our services--does not consider them fast, secure, etc--enough to pay for them--we don&#x27;t get revenue.<p>I very much doubt any of our competitors cares as much about your data staying private, available, usable, etc, as we do.  There is no other way for us to capture value from the market then make you all ridiculously pleased with Dropbox and Dropbox&#x27;s treatment of your data.<p>So I would ask you to imagine what the culture of a company looks like that is incentivized thusly.

So, you have to spend the time to talk to tech people since it&#x27;s late at night and the kids are asleep and you just don&#x27;t feel like getting on the phone to battle.<p>Got the usual excuses that service was being upgraded in the street, the line looked fine to them, it must be something on our end (that one&#x27;s always predictable). Annnd of course, a tech came out, twiddled and fiddled and discovered our signal was low. Weird that it just happened now and now when the second cable run was installed when we moved in.<p>Because my wife and I (sadly) work from home after hours, when you have no internet, you&#x27;re screwed. We weren&#x27;t watching tv anymore and when we did it was netflix or game of thrones or silicon valley - all watchable via hbo go. So, I switched to Sonic.net (the best isp in the bay area in my mind) and haven&#x27;t looked back.<p>Sure, we&#x27;re running over at&t fiber (sigh) and capped at 50 down/5 up (sigh), but it just works. We&#x27;re not running 50 one day, 80 another, 10 another and we&#x27;re paying about the same for internet as we were on Comcast.",1444932012

A common nazi excuse after WWII was that they were just obeying orders. That excuse seems to have been wildly disregarded.<p>Edit: Yes, I am very aware <i>both</i> parties should then be considered morally responsible.",1444932005

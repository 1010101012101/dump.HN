629435,comment,629393,629393,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Why aren't you charging for your proposal work? I'm dead serious.<p>There is little downside to doing this once you get over the shock of such a ""callous"" suggestion that the customer actually pay for your technical and skilled analysis of their particular problem.<p>First, anyone who won't pay for the problem analysis and recommendations will not pay for the end result of a project that results from a free proposal either. This is mainly because they probably aren't as invested in the solution as you (or even they) think they are.  The notion of ""scaring someone off"" is fantasy; better to do it in 5 seconds than after 20 hours of work. If a client is going to go forward with your project, they will pay for the expert advice. They do this already with their lawyers, accountants and other service providers.<p>Second, you do need to review your services. It is evident that if you are losing greater than 50% of your proposals, and yet other developers charge your prices, one of the following is occurring:<p>1. Your proposals suck. (ie you are not selling your services well enough)<p>2. You are targeting the wrong clients (easy to do if you are giving away your proposals)<p>3. You are possibly mis-matched for your target industries - size, etc.<p>Assuming you are competent, it is very likely that you are simply wasting too much of your time with prospects you haven't properly qualified.<p>The other thing you can do when you get the ""out of my range"" comment is to ask what is the range. At that point, you can provide a solution (again on fee) that addresses a subset of the problem, at a easier to swallow price. It also allows the option for them to use your services again in the future, which could actually net you more fees.",1243468183

Actually not subsidizing can be non-optimal in a wide range of situations, although in general intervention is questionable.<p>We'd have no tech industry at all in Asia if it weren't for HEAVY industry subsidization in early stages in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, followed by the wildly successful Chinese special export zones (which are, to some extent, just a loosening of laws, but also included economic stimulus). This same pattern has emerged worldwide in a number of other industries (Taiwanese Orchids and African textiles off the top of my head) that otherwise wouldn't have appeared at all.<p>If you'd like some better cites on this you could do worse than to start with the work of Dani Rodrik: <a href=""http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~drodrik/papers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~drodrik/papers.html</a>
The government doesn't have to pick winners in terms of single companies or technologies, but subsidizing whole sectors is often quite useful.<p><pre><code>  2) Increasing transparency of its laws</code></pre>
Totally agree here<p><pre><code>  3) Taxing negative externalities rather than positive ones 
  (so tax carbon instead of capital gains)
</code></pre>
Negative Externalities are often extremely difficult to value in the free market (the original Cap&Trade systems had wild swings in price until the market matured via gov't intervention), so that can be a sticking point. Not everything can be cleanly auctioned for value, whereas positive externalities in the form of profit are usually clearly valued.<p><pre><code>  4) Removing market distortions like 
  the immigration issue discussed in the article.</code></pre>
Agreed<p><pre><code>  1) Subsidizing some part of the industry which therefore
  damages the innovation that would out-compete it.</code></pre>
Which is why an approach is needed that doesn't pick winners, but is equally helpful to a wide range of (generally small) companies. This is particularly true if you can't get competing countries to stop subsidizing.<p>The 'second kind' of policies arise not necessarily from a desire to be 'world leading', but because lawmakers have a different criteria of what is positive than you do. Many things that are strictly profit increasing are not welfare increasing, whether for the better (Save AIG because they reinsure half of the damn country and insurance rates would soar), or for the worse (Save GM because unions are politically powerful and raise my chances of re-election).<p>I feel like many HN'ers (although not necessarily you) went out and took econ 101 and 102, decided it was mathematical proof for strict Randian libertarianism, and now deride <i>any</i> government. This simplified view isn't well supported even in economics, particularly since so many problems in real life fall into either collective action or non-rational behavior categories. </rant>",1243466301

I'm not saying I'm typical, I'm just saying that my personal experience is such that your point never would have occurred to me.<p>But even granting your point, you can still market against that experience without implying that you only schedule people for ERs.<p>Right now I imagine that this site gets most of its business from people who call the ER directly, and then the participating ER tells them about the site (I could be totally wrong about that, though).  Going forward, though, I would think that way that this is going to be used is that a user will know they need treatment, go to the site (find it via a search engine, whatever), look for the treatment facility that satisfies some mix of 'near', 'soon', and 'perceived ability to treat my problem', and put their name down.<p>If there's a marketing hump to get over, I would think it would be snagging people who are coming from a search engine or via some route other than having the ER send them there directly.

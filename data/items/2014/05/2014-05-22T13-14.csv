The API and the hardware were a delight.<p>I remember being frustrated that the only means of technical support was a terrible walled garden web forum. There was no email gateway, so one had to keep checking that site for answers. I would have much preferred mailing lists and a public website indexable by search engines.<p>The bigger frustration was that T-Mobile was the gatekeeper for app distribution. If you wanted to get an app to a phone, it had to be on the store, you had to get T-Mobile&#x27;s blessing, and they had no plans to support free apps. The carriers were very much still oriented around the ringtone economy and were terrified that you might put something on your phone without getting a cut of a fee.<p>People complain now about Apple and Google and the processes that impede app distribution, but the iOS and Android ecosystem is way better than what existed when the carriers were in charge.<p>I remember thinking that the Danger folks were very responsive and very sharp, but it didn&#x27;t matter because they were in the end beholden to T-Mobile and T-Mobile didn&#x27;t get it.

Why should I say the feature are cool and how the tech interesting? It&#x27;s not anymore. I had those conversations years ago.

7783788,comment,7783012,7783626,5,0,rayiner,,,"> Basically all public utilities in Zurich are city owned and operated. And while it may appear weird in other parts of the world, people here actually love their public utilities. This probably has to do with really high service quality being quite reasonably priced. But I digress.<p>Here in the states, our public utilities are more often than not of poor quality for the price. For example, I lived in Atlanta, GA for many years. Much of its sewer system dates to the rebuilding of the city after the Civil War. It&#x27;s in violation of federal environmental laws, and when it rains too much it overflows and dumps untreated sewage into the local river.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why municipal services are so bad in the states versus in parts of Europe. After all, there&#x27;s no private water/sewer company lobbying to blame for the water/sewer system in Atlanta (or Chicago or D.C. or the numerous U.S. cities with similar problems). I suspect it has to do with the locus of power vis-a-vis urban and suburban voters in the U.S. versus Europe. That is to say, most U.S. metro areas take the form of poorer central cities supported by wealthier suburbs, at least to a greater degree than I think is true in Europe.[1] Thus, there is less concentrated political will, as well as less money, to spent on infrastructure within cities.<p>Regardless of the reasons, I think many people in the U.S. are justifiably skeptical of public utilities. I personally would very much trust the city of Zurich to build my internet infrastructure. I wouldn&#x27;t so much trust Atlanta, or Wilmington, or Philadelphia, or Baltimore . . . maybe Chicago or New York City. I say this as someone who has lived or worked in these cities, and relied on the municipal infrastructure more than the vast majority of Americans (because I take public transit and don&#x27;t like to drive).<p>[1] For example: Atlanta has a core city only a little bit larger than Zurich proper (though only 1/3 as dense), but has a metro area 3x as large as the Zurich metro area. The vast majority of the wealthy voters in Atlanta live in the surrounding suburbs. Thus, funding for road construction to get these folks to and from work in the city takes priority over funding for services used by people who reside in the city.",1400766214

I am a male and I can&#x27;t see my involvement in the situation working out for me at all. Now you might say I&#x27;m wrong for putting my self-preservation above that on Kristen&#x27;s but this isn&#x27;t just about preventing physical harm to myself. In fact if I knew that I would only be cut (non-fatal) then I wouldn&#x27;t have this stance. Instead I am worried about the ramifications of &quot;attacking&quot; a women in public like this.<p>We have seen countless times in the media where someone coming to the aid of someone in danger (not in an attack situation) has been sued for helping (just google &quot;rescuer sued&quot;). So if trying to help someone alone can get you screwed just think about what can happen when there are two people involved. What assurances do I have that I won&#x27;t inadvertently hurt Kristen in the process and that she won&#x27;t decide to sue me? Or that the attacker in this situation won&#x27;t sue me for &quot;attacking her&quot; while trying to prevent her from stabbing Kristen (google &quot;attacker sues victim&quot;)? I&#x27;ll tell you: NONE. For all we know the attacker will sue Kristen for throwing hot coffee on her, this story isn&#x27;t over yet.<p>Let&#x27;s examine an example:<p>I intervene, I kick the attacker in the head to get her off Kristen. Let&#x27;s ignore for now the chance that a bystander only see&#x27;s me kick this women in the head and assumes it was unprovoked and then attacks me. Then Kristen gets up, shakily thanks me and the disappears into the crowd. I am left standing over the body of a women that I just physically assaulted. A bystander had pulled out their phone to film what was happening but only caught me kicking the women. If I leave the scene then there is a chance I will be hunted down and if I stay at the very least I am going to spend the rest of the day at the police station. The attacker stuffers brain damage from the kick and the family sues me for all I&#x27;m worth and I spend the rest of my life paying off the debt while waking up daily to the thought of &quot;No good deed...&quot;.<p>I understand this is a worst case outcome but there is no way in hell I am going to risk my life AND if I survive the remainder of my life over a $600 phone and the contents of her bag, it simply is not worth it. I&#x27;d cover those costs with my first meeting with an attorney. If the attacker was actually stabbing Kristen then it would be a different story but that&#x27;s not what happened. I&#x27;ve talked to people trained in various martial arts and the vast majority of them say that if they were mugged they would hand over their belongings.

I think that perhaps the easiest way to be extremely busy all the time is to not step back, take a breath, and think about a more efficient way to accomplish task X.<p>In a culture where status is attained through work, if you lack the creativity and skills to be a standout wizard who breezes through and builds cool shit that others think they could never do (translations: anyone on HN)  then perhaps &quot;busy&quot; is the other way to earn some semblance of status.",1400765080

Apple could not care less about web apps by-passing the app store in this regard.<p>For one, they initially offered web apps in place of a native API, and developers (and users) hated it.<p>Second, they had for the longest time (still do IIRC), the fastest and more complete web browser experience on mobile. Including extra JS hooks for things like the accelerometer and such. Strange coming from a company concerned about the web apps by-passing the app store.<p>Third, most iOS developers don&#x27;t pericularly want web apps. The App Store has half a billion of credit cards on the ready, and gives billions of dollars to developers each year. It will be extremely difficult to try to monetize some web based game for iOS users. Plus it offers far better performance (and possibilities for integration) than some Javascript/WebGL game.<p>Fourth, WebGL is not that great a deal on the desktop web yet (even most casual games prefer the canvas API or Flash still), so why would it be on the mobile web?<p>><i>If that was the only reason to not having feature parity with other OS&#x27;s, they&#x27;d have some something about it.. oh, you know. 2-3 years ago.</i><p>Well, those other OSes, namely Android, just enabled WebGL in their Chrome browser 9 months ago. And, oh you know, that in the beta version of the broswer.

According to this article (<a href=""https://medium.com/technology-musings/941d15ec96f0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/technology-musings/941d15ec96f0</a>) the drop happened in November of 2012.

Sometimes it gets it wrong, but generally if a site is being filtered down it&#x27;s because there are too many pages of the site in the index that are apparently not helpful to users.<p>I do think that the design has a lot to do with MetaFilter&#x27;s demise.

The question is who will be able to negotiate this transition in a transparent and positive way when politicians are already corrupted by them?<p>I in no way advocate violence, (except occasional lapses of thought on the hockey rink).  I just think that these events will occur:  If there are millions of people that the state believes are refuse, many will turn to crime to eat and as the social contract is broken, some of these people will tend towards violence against those who run (what were once democratic) countries. The oligarchs are a natural enemy to the &quot;refuse&quot; of society because they do have a large hand in their plight.  Consider: They generally advocate for trade pacts which lower the wages of low skill workers.  They extract high rents for education so many cannot better themselves.  They pay as little and hire as few as humanly possible.  The only aspect of their operations that they would have in a first world country are point where they receive customers&#x27; money.

Questions of trust and safety are natural for people to raise in a variety of everyday circumstances. For example, when people get on a plane or take medicine its natural for them to be concerned about the safety. In eBay&#x27;s case, eBay is a market place and a financial services company so it&#x27;s reasonable to ask for high standards and to question what their security practices are like.<p>One would also think that eBay would have a strong interest in developing trust between themselves and their customers, but there is little evidence of that recognition. Specifically, the going corporate standard for a major security breach among eBay&#x27;s corporate peers is (a) full and (b) immediate disclosure.<p>By (a) full, note, that eBay has come our with a very murky statement about exactly what happened. There is nothing more substantial than &quot;you should change your password but we don&#x27;t think there is any danger&quot;. Well, was there general database access? Did attackers had access to production servers? All of them? Is there any impartial 3rd party audit that stands behind eBays security statements? Further, as part of a full disclose, it&#x27;s good procedure to disclose how passwords were stored if they expect to establish trust. They have had 2 weeks at least to prepare their statements and they can&#x27;t do better than the useless &quot;passwords were encrypted&quot;?. There are really only two possibilities here: \n(1) passwords were combined with a random salt and then hashed or \n(2) they were morons. \nAnd right now given their public statement it looks like (2).<p>By (b) immediate, note, its not unreasonable to expect that a certain percentage of eBay&#x27;s users use the same username / password for both their eBay and their PayPal accounts. So for a couple of weeks now eBay has been aware of a potential financial danger to their customers and they have been sitting on the problem. Fail.<p>Security breaches happen to everyone. There is no faulting eBay there. The fault is with all aspects of their response. They have had a major security breach and they have not responded with a proportional disclosure.

It explains so much more about white-collar culture than I could ever get into here. At the time, that was <i>the</i> most stressful, painful, and socially demanding white-collar job in the country-- which is why people doing it, by the standards of the time, were paid extremely well.

Interestingly, I think this has caught me out in situations previously.  My observation was typing non-English characters would be too challenging on the keyboard I use, and as such provided an example where that may be evident.<p>Having glossed over the other (more important) problem as whether to use a URL shortener was excluded from my assessment (but interpreted as acceptance).  Contrary to that, I could decide to use this technique to shorten URLs on my own domain, where the issues I observed would still be valid.<p>However, I&#x27;ll throw a counter argument to support using URL shorteners just for the fun of it.  I may decide to use it when:<p>1. There is a service-level-agreement that the service is to be operational for a set period of time (usually tied to a paid-for service).\n2. It is akin to me using a phone number redirection service (I pay a top up for the redirection), and as such, have printed this number on business cards.\n3. It is akin to putting a Twitter, Facebook or Linked In URL - all services that are free, and as such, have risk associated.\n4. It is akin to providing a URL with a domain maintained by a third party country - for example, Libya controlling the .ly domain[1]\n5. It may allow me to change the target URL at any time, keeping the content up to date.\n6. It may allow me to monitor click through analytics.<p>But, assuming you only wanted to use it only for online purposes, then you have the following considerations:<p>1. Users don&#x27;t know the target of the URL and may reduce trust.  I know I&#x27;ve not clicked on shortened URLs of things I am unsure of the target page.\n2. What benefit does shortening actually provide?  If it&#x27;s visual real-estate, the link can still be long with a shortened label.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/08/bitly-libya"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/08/bitly-liby...</a>",1400763707

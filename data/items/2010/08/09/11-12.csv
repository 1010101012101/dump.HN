UPS and FedEx likely lose (traveling salesman problem is NP-complete). Any other business that hinges on solving hard problems might lose, though counterintuitively, some might win--firms that do a really good job at approximate solutions to NP problems (is ITA an example?) are extremely talented at doing something really hard, whereas if P = NP, it would be easier for any old firm to develop a perfect solution.<p>But considering the fact that we've all been operating under the assumption that P != NP, the losers don't lose much (if anything) and the winners don't win much (if anything). If P = NP was proven, it's possible but not guaranteed that bank robbers and whatever software firms can pivot fast enough to exploit P = NP get huge windfalls, internet retailers would be ruined, banks who didn't shut off their data links fast enough would be ruined, etc. This worst case scenario hinges on a proof that took the form of a proof by counterexample, which happened to neatly solve an NP-complete problem in <i>efficient</i> P time. In better case scenarios, where other proof forms were used or the P-time solution was a horrific factor like O(n^100,000), online retailers would still lose a little if only based on media hype about the discovery scaring grandmothers away.",1281353588

1587630,comment,1585085,1586954,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"Reversibility is dependent on the type and extent of the damage. If the damage is isolated to the muscle, then it probably is reversible to a certain extent. First, the muscles in spasm (constant state of tension) need to be massaged back to pliability, then you need to focus on stretching the muscles so they can better manage repetitive stress, and once the muscle is relatively healthy again you can begin strengthening it to withstand added tension and pressure and to heal itself better. As programmers, we're constantly abusing our arm muscles, and they will wear down over time. The trick is to minimize the abuse, and maximize your ability to regenerate, and hopefully you can get to a state where you heal more at night than you damage in the day.<p>Now, prolonged stress and inflammation (and certain physical abnormalities) can cause damage to the nerves themselves and nerves suck at healing. If you start having problems with sensation (feeling cold or numb), that's the result of nerves under attack. Prolonged attack equals irreversible damage.<p>As far as your notation about collagen gluing muscles, that sounds about right to me, and is sort of part of what I was saying earlier. Also, collagen is largely made up of water, and this is why it is so critical to keep yourself hydrated.<p>Also, muscles locked in static positions (I assume as a result of spasm) can begin to act as a single unit rather than individual muscles. When this happens, your body can actually try to sort of ""heal them together"" and the muscles can literally begin to bind to each other. Massage, particularly deep tissue massage, can help to break these bands apart so your muscles become independent again.<p>That's my understanding, anyway. I'm definitely no expert in this, and my knowledge largely comes from online research, and the book ""It's Not Carpal Tunnel.""",1281353004

Not only carbonic acid is formed, you conveniently forget to mention that it disseminates as a combination of dissolved CO2, HCO3, CO3 and the H2CO3 you mention. The CO3, carbonate, is essential in the formation of coral atolls. Without carbon dioxide sinking and forming CO3, coral could not form. The relative mixture of what results depends on a number of factors of which ocean temperature is the primary one. The Orr article, which is the original source on acidification leading to coral loss, reports on a theoretical computer model about what might happen in the future and is not based on any actual observational data that this has happened to coral in the past or is happening now. Coral losses in the 1998 season were due to el niño conditions and are not related to acidification. Regarding computer models of global climate and global ecosystem interdynamics it is telling that none so far have succeeded in predicting anything beyond random chance. Because of this, it is not reasonable to assume that the computer model simulations that have yet to be compared against real life are the first ones that will finally be correct.",1281351991

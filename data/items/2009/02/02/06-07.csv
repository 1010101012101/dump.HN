Rather, I included it in the hopes that people give it a look so that they can answer the question at hand: ""how do they make money?""<p>There are actually three ways to make money.  You can sell things, receive money for nothing (donations), or steal.  I would have to agree with you that selling goods, services, or ads makes money.  So, I wonder, what does AddThis.com sell, and to whom?  Or are they just hemorrhaging money on the servers needed to serve (and track) 20b impressions a month?",1233554756

Somebody help!",,"Hi,<p>I have a website ABC.com the thing is that www.ABC.com is working  while ABC.com is not.\nI set up domain forwarding for both to point to www.ABC.com but the browser says its an infinite loop. So, I setup a subdomain in ABC.example.com and pointed both ABC.com and www.ABC.com to ABC.example.com with the URL masked. Will there be any problems from SE point of view? Right now it seems to be working fine. Also I absolutely dont want my visitors to know that it is hosted in example.com As this is a custom domain issue I dont have .htaccess or 301 redirect permissions",1233554751

Those who clear that hurdle remain under constant threat of eviction unless they talk to everyone around them every ten minutes.

I must say here, since it has to  be said somewhere about Hugo, that I think the series of comments automatically evoked by this kind of statement, the ticker-tape remarks to do with anthropomorphism’ are beside the point. Our emotional life is shared with the animals; we flatter ourselves that human emotions  are so much more complicated than theirs.  Perhaps the only emotion not known to a cat or a dog is -romantic love. And even then, we  have to wonder. What is the emotional devotion of a dog for his master or mistress but something like that sort of love, all pining and yearning and ‘give me, give me’. What was Hugo’s love for Emily but that? As for our thoughts, our intellectual apparatus, our rationalisms and our logics and our deductions and so on, it can be said with absolute  certainty that dogs and cats and monkeys cannot  make a  rocket to fly to the moon or weave artificial dress materials out of the by-products of  petroleum, but as we sit in the ruins of this variety of intelligence, it is hard to give it much value: I suppose we are undervaluing it now as we over-valued it then.

While there were some advantages, upon further investigation it was not the right path forward for two important reasons. First, the Web is built on the principle of multiple independent, yet interoperable implementations of Web standards and we felt it was important to counter movement towards a monoculture on the Web. Second, given the engineering effort required, we found that we could deliver an interoperability focused engine to customers significantly faster if we started from our own engine (especially if unshackled from legacy compatibility concerns), rather than building up a new browser around an open-source engine. We will continue to look at open source and shared source models where it makes sense and look forward to sharing more details in coming posts.</i><p>This is a powerful paragraph from the article.

I figured I should do a TL;DR since those posts are even more epic in length than I realized, so I snagged some salient points:<p>1. You may look at your project and think, &quot;I&#x27;m never going to make it. I&#x27;ll never finish.&quot; Please, I urge you to set these thoughts aside and push through. Think about the analogy of building a wall. A wall is built one brick at a time. Watch a mason build a wall one day. You will observe that he or she lays one brick at a time.<p>This is how you have to view your project. Sure, it would be amazing to have an entire day, every day to devote to your project. However, the reality is that most of us simply do not have that luxury. So, strive to think of it as a mason: lay one brick at a time, and eventually the wall will be built. Every character that you type into Xcode, Visual Studio, etc. turns into a keyword, a variable name, etc... that subsequently turns into a line. Those lines build up, day by day, and before you know it, you have a program, and you look back and think, &quot;Wow, why did I ever think I could not finish?&quot;<p>2. You have to fight. This is paramount. I will say it again... you have to fight! What I mean here is fighting by engaging your Will. Engage your will to get up, to get moving. Engage your will to eat right, to exercise and go to bed on time so that you have the energy to get up and bring it.<p>3. You never know where your work will take you. Do not forget that, you have to dream it first in your mind before you can see it in your life. And to see it in your life, you must work. You may not be able to see things clearly now, but you never know what doors could open for you that you did not even know existed.<p>4.

YMMV.<p>1. Condition yourself to be sharply aware and mindful whenever you&#x27;re &quot;copying and pasting&quot;.  It&#x27;s a big code smell. Stop, think and ask if you can refactor sensibly into reusable functions, views, models etc.<p>2. Be ruthless with naming conventions.  If a table, function, API name doesn&#x27;t sound like what it is supposed to be doing or used for, change it before it&#x27;s too late.  You&#x27;ll be very sorry if you let this type of procrastination pass as it will confuse you later or worse may have cascading effect on poor naming conventions because one object was named incorrectly at the start.<p>3. If you find your own code difficult to enhance and modify the next time you visit it, spend the time immediately to refactor. Next time it&#x27;s easier to continue.  Avoiding this will result in two things:<p>3.1  You&#x27;ll subconsciously develop a strong aversion to visiting the piece of code again (often resulting in all sorts of compensating hacks.  Unhealthy holy cows can emerge.)<p>3.2  You&#x27;ll doom your successor for sure.<p>4.  Don&#x27;t write programs with no runtime configuration capabilities.<p>5.  Don&#x27;t write programs with more than 2 runtime configuration options.  If your program needs more than 2, ship - then add as enhancement.<p>6.  Condition yourself to always think of loading resources as late as possible and release as early as possible.  Make this an OCD type of habit.  It pays off.<p>7.  Finally, don&#x27;t be intimidated by the experts in the field.  Don&#x27;t ever strive to be better than or compare yourself competitively with anyone else.  The experience is for yourself. Your programs are your own works, and your curiosity, creativity and insight should drive your passion to improve daily.<p>(The last point applies to bodybuilding to, I suppose.)",1424978642

But there are very few people who <i>choose</i> Comcast from between multiple broadband providers. And then they shot themselves in the foot in the public discourse with their constant stream of customer abuse and terrible support stories.<p>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about this, but I should read up more on what parts of Title II are being applied to what parts of the network here.<p>In particular, does this have any effect on Comcast saying &quot;Netflix needs to pay us or we won&#x27;t install sufficient peering to meet our customers&#x27; demand for Netflix connections&quot;?<p>Having a second ISP choice where Netflix works properly would fix that pretty quickly, but I&#x27;m not clear on whether Title II does.

But, in the absence of Title II reclassification today, a future Commission could still have imposed a rate-setting regime. How? They could have reclassified broadband under Title II! In other words, reclassification under Title II today doesn&#x27;t allow future Commissions to do anything they couldn&#x27;t have done before, if they wanted to, because in either case, the the Commission has the power to take both steps simultaneously.<p>I guess you could argue that it makes it easier politically to impose rate setting in the future. But I&#x27;m not sure this holds any water if the very thing that worries most critics of Title II reclassification is rate setting.",1424977998

The commissioners and their staff then look over the comments they have received, draft an order that responds to the important points raised in the comments, vote on it, and then make it public as a binding rule. Perhaps this is counterintuitive to some, and maybe it&#x27;s not the best way to make rules.

Section 208<p>(a) Any person, any body politic or municipal organization, or State commission, complaining of anything done or omitted to be done by any common carrier subject to this Act, in contravention of the provisions thereof, may apply to said Commission by petition which shall briefly state the facts, whereupon a statement of the complaint thus made shall be forwarded by the Commission to such common carrier, who shall be called upon to satisfy the complaint or to answer the same in writing within a reasonable time to be specified by the Commission. If such common carrier within the time specified shall make reparation for the injury alleged to have been caused, the common carrier shall be relieved of liability to the complainant only for the particular violation of law thus complained of. If such carrier or carriers shall not satisfy the complaint within the time specified or there shall appear to be any reasonable ground for investigating said complaint, it shall be the duty of the Commission to investigate the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper. No complaint shall at any time be dismissed because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant.<p>This one is pretty great:<p>47 U.S.C. Section 251<p>(a) GENERAL DUTY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS.--Each\ntelecommunications carrier has the duty--\n(1) to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and\nequipment of other telecommunications carriers; and\n(2) not to install network features, functions, or capabilities that do\nnot comply with the guidelines and standards established pursuant to\nsection 255 or 256.<p>255 is with regard to the use of telephones by those with disabilities, so it will very likely undergo forbearance.<p>256 is fairly long, so I won&#x27;t reproduce it here.

The minority that realizes this will forever be prisoner to the irrational mob majority that act like tribesmen and incessantly demand group privileges.",1424977267

If ISPs start modifying speed and/or access to certain domains I can only see that as damaging for Google.

Because journalists are there, celebrities are there. And because celebrities are there, journalists are there. It&#x27;s a virtuous cycle.

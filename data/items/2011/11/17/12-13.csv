To fix it we would have to invent a device that can scan something the plumber has done and then recreate it on demand.<p>At that point, after years and years of studying to be the best plumber he can be, Joe Plumber goes out and does a job only to have some joker come up, scan his work and then provide his <i>own</i> plumbing service for 1/4th the price.  How is Joe Plumber to compete?  He could try dropping his prices to 1/4th but then the joker will just drop his again (since he has nothing invested he can do this).  At some point, no one would be stupid enough to invest in learning to be a plumber ever again.  Everyone would just get this magical copy device.  Of course, the problem is that when that finally happened we would be locked into whatever we had when the last plumber stopped producing.",1321534748
3247474,comment,3247373,3247446,10,0,dissident,,,"This isn't a replacement of existing DNS with some arbitrary JSON protocol, this is a P2P DNS called Namecoin which happens to use JSON. Arguably, the flexibility offered by JSON can allow for sophisticated technologies to emerge which can take advantage of this naming system.<p>It's clear from the very article of this submission that this is the case. For instance, the I2P fields are combined in a structure that best represents the resource on the I2P network. A different structure is necessary to represent a Tor or freenet resource identifier.<p>If Internet naming is going to be fragmented, I'd rather it not be wasted on Alternative DNS roots, which fall privy to the same fundamental problems as our current domain name system. A Namecoin system cannot be so easily censored.",1321534732

3247456,comment,3247154,3247154,3,0,johanjessen,,,"Good points. And the connector chaos is a thick thorn in the eye of Apple simplicity.<p>The thing is, design is always a question of compromise. In order to make something truly simple and minimal, you have to sacrifice some affordances. And in order to make something truly easy to use, you have to sacrifice minimalism (think of children's toys). It's a balancing act. If you get it right, people will love your products. If you tip just a little too much to the wrong side you fall, and you end up with Vista security prompts or Apple Keyboard USB extension nonsense.<p>JGC uses the example of the DVD-drive and the serial number as problem cases. But I'd argue that only the DVD-drive suffers. The serial number will not be relevant in 99,9% of daily computing for normal people. Non-hackers don't care about serial numbers. If something goes wrong they call Apple support (or do the Google routine). Of course it's a matter of focus. Do you want people to easily find the serial number, then by all means, make it easier to spot. Clearly Apple don't. The drawback is not just aesthetics but continuos reminding people that a serial number is important (which it isn't in normal use).<p>The DVD-drive, however, could be better. But think of your hard drives or SD-cards. None of my 5 USB hard drives have physical buttons to eject them. I still need to 'eject' it, which means I'll have to drag it to the bin! How's that for an affordance. It's a legacy UI behavior which is hopelessly misconstrued. Putting things in the bin DELETES them - that's the behavior we've taught generations of users. It's even worse than clicking ""Start"" to turn off your computer on Windows. If you have a HD full of pictures of your loved ones would you risk putting them in the bin if you didn't know any better...? Probably not.<p>Physical affordances have their place. Especially in a world of touch interfaces a button becomes a powerful switch (think the silent ringer on the iPhone). But they are like Tabasco sauces - add a little and it can make the dish, add a lot and it ruins it. It's a never-ending struggle.",1321534217

3247407,comment,3246259,3247337,5,0,thaumaturgy,,,"OK, but, why? Of all the reasons to disagree with someone -- or, in the case of most of this particular thread, hate them -- ""they haven't done something I've heard of"" seems like a pretty weak one.<p>If you found out that he had been behind some kind of huge success, would you agree with him more? Or, if you found out that he was born into money, would that make him more wrong? If he could fill a paper with things that he's done for people you've never heard of, would that make him more credible?<p>I could understand calling for someone's credentials if they were trying to argue from experience: ""I'm a manager and I can tell you that scheduling isn't a difficult problem."" ""Oh? What do you manage?"" ""...uhm, a yard cleanup business with my friend."" That would be a fair and useful criticism then.<p>But I didn't get that kind of a vibe from this rant. I just went back and re-read it. (Thanks for that...) Nowhere in this rant can I find anything that even smells like, ""Follow me because I <i>have been</i> successful."" The closest I can get to that is, ""Follow me because I <i>want to be</i> successful"", as in things like, ""I'm trying. I seem to be getting there. I want you guys to get there."" etc. etc.<p>Maybe it's somewhere else on his site? ""Command Flows to the Worthy"" sounds like a good candidate, but no, that one's just a short opinion piece and, again, doesn't make the claim that, ""I'm right because I'm successful.""<p>You specifically mention being ""better than"" 99% of the population. OK. Maybe you're referring to, ""99% of people you interact with in life are fucking jokers."" Well, I don't agree with that -- because I don't <i>want to</i> -- but is it objectively wrong? Given all the posts on HN about how hard it is to find good candidates and how many developers can't pass FizzBuzz and on and on and on, that air of superiority is certainly ubiquitous here. And, if HN represents the cream of the crop of developers and startups and stuff, like it collectively seems to think it does, then is that 99% statement actually wrong? And, even if it is, does it really make any sense to take it literally? Does taking it literally and then brow-beating the literal interpretation of it really change his overall point? I don't think so.<p>Or, maybe you're talking about the part where he says, ""You're all highly skilled, top 1% at your craft."" All the same questions apply there, too. Or, ""You're all highly intelligent, top 1% of the population."" That, actually, I wouldn't be surprised by. Top 1% in terms of intelligence -- assuming IQ as a reasonable measure -- isn't really all that difficult.<p>So, I just don't get why, in this particular case, it really makes a difference whether or not he's done anything yet. Even if this is worth anyone's time arguing about, which it isn't.<p>There's a truly awesome amount of meanness in this thread. I don't know why I clicked on the comments here in the first place; might've just been because there were a lot of them. But I've been really surprised at the viciousness here. There's often a mean comment or two in a thread, and half of the time, I'm the one making it. But, in this case, the sheer density and froth of the criticisms and psychoanalysis and everything else is just really breathtaking. And out of all of that, the ""Well, what's he done that makes him Mr. Big Shot?"" criticism just seems ... silliest, for lack of a better word.",1321532901

Seeing the great line-up of talks that were scheduled for the London event, CodeKen and Equal Experts decided to mount a rescue mission and went on securing the support of the majority of the speakers.<p>""We owe a large part of our success to our ability to leverage outstanding developers from our highly selective network of associates, said Thomas Granier, Managing Director of Equal Experts.  So, we jumped at the opportunity to support the developer community at large.<p>""Equal Experts were the perfect partner for the conference, Jon Dickinson from CodeKen adds.  Having a sponsor with such a highly skilled development capability meshed perfectly with the experienced speaker line up and the insightful audience.""<p>The event took place in Canary Wharf on the 14th and 15th November with about 100 delegates attending.<p>There were thought provoking talks including Jon Skeet talking about the benefits of coding in Evil, with help from Tony the Pony and his Evil hench-kitty.  Michael Barker from LMAX, and Martin Thompson, shattered many folklore assumptions about building high performance systems.  Julian Brown from Equal Experts gave insights on how to introduce NoSQL in the Enterprise.  Tom Wright used two developer guinea pigs to perform a live demonstration of sensory substitution software that helps visually impaired people to see.<p>The conference was so well received that CodeKen and Equal Experts are planning on running a similar event towards the end of 2012.<p>Ends<p>About Equal Experts<p>Since its inception in 2005, Equal Experts has been providing bespoke application development services to blue chip clients, including major investment banks and leading Telecom companies.

3247383,comment,3244229,3244229,1,0,jqueryin,,,"From reading through the various responses on this post, I believe one very feasible and worthwhile solution to asynchronous UIs is to maintain what has been referred to as a transaction log somewhere in the UI for the user to be able to see containing all requests and their subsequent status/response message when the proper event fires. This would assume that any actionable items would trigger immediate changes to your UI in favor of the ""success"" case. It would be up to you as to whether you'd like to revert that scenario in the scenario that a failure occurs in an event response.<p>This would remove the dreaded ""blocked UI"" scenario because everything appears to happen instantaneously, however there would be failsafes in place when something goes wrong (the infrequent scenario).<p>To me it seems more a matter of order reversal in how we handle AJAX calls (assuming you aren't using an async/evented system).<p>I can, however, think of downsides. Take, for instance, a scenario where you may have a nested tree of actionable items that may have prerequisites on the other's completion. You could chain the events, but you might end up with a queue unbeknownst to the end user. Worse, a failure might occur at the parent level which leads to failures for all subsequent calls.

During a recession it's more cost efficient: my leather shoes polish up a lot nicer than tennis shoes and last much longer. I have button-downs from 2001 that still look great. I also save a lot of time by receiving a lot better customer service when I'm eating out, shopping, or running errands. People respect a well dressed man, there's nothing superficial about it.<p>I'm not saying you can't wear a shirt when you're coding, but the moment you're representing your company and it's people — you should look (and therefore feel) very proud. Toss on a sport coat over the designer tee, it won't kill you to look nice. And not to mention, when you congregate a bunch of designer-tshirt-wearing coders in a room, are you really expressing individuality anymore? :)",1233256704

By allowing an unemployed programmer to continue paying his rent, you prevent him from using his skills for evil.

Don't get your hopes up.<p>These angel cartels work in phases -- you start with a big pool of hopefuls, then if they ""like"" you, they start to require that you give more presentations, and attend more parties and whatnot.  At each phase, the time investments get larger and larger, and ultimately, you have to put in a lot of effort for a relatively small amount of money.<p>Meanwhile, you'll find that you're competing with ""startups"" that aren't startups, or that are in completely different fields (some of the top-rated presentations at our sessions were for real-estate investors!)  Very few people get funded by these things, relative to the starting pool, and those that do get funded tend to be ""startups"" that have relatively conventional business models (like the aforementioned real-estate people).<p>My impression is that angel cartels are gathering places for modestly rich people who want to get their feet wet in angel investing.

963631,comment,963341,963341,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Any language that needs advocacy has already lost. Good languages are adopted by people because they solve problems better than other languages. It is a market place of sorts. As soon as you feel the need to advocate a language you are actually advocating what you use, instead of letting the language speak for itself.<p>The net effect of all this advocacy is possibly even negative, the more you try to ram a programming language down peoples throats the less inclined they are to give it a shot because they already have a negative experience before even trying it.<p>Languages with an open and welcoming, real-world problem solving oriented community tend to benefit from the people using it and talking about using it. Those that simply hawk a language as 'great' and keep on hammering on its strong points are missing the point here.<p>One of the reasons perl lost out not only to python but even to PHP is because it has a stigma attached to it of being (very) hard to maintain.<p>That may be more of a reflection on perl programmers than on perl though.",1259312286

If it was anyone else I would have overruled the choice, but it turns out he was right.<p>It's an unmitigated disaster of a language, as a whole, but if your needs are a ""scaffolding language"" that can script something together quickly and you're using a lot of regex, I have to admit, it's a great choice.",1259311634

I can certainly agree that Russian is a difficult language to acquire for native english speakers; far harder than Spanish.<p>I am curious, however: has anyone found nonobvious ways to make money with language skills (obvious meaning translator, etc)?  While some of these, esp eg Arabic or Russian, might be very interesting to learn, and it would probably be a great experience living in an Arabic speaking country, there are high costs -- the education and the time living in a country and not getting much done but language courses.  What are good ways of making this a financially sound thing to do, or will it always be solely a cultural experience?",1259311585

As opposed to a made-up page on a dating website that is just full of random claims, your users have a chance to show what they are about and what their recent life has been about. I think this is very valuable.<p>Just a few things. Your home page is now full of men. You might want to tweak your display to get 50% of each sex. Also, the central and right column display the same thing. You could have the most recent events in the middle and the newcomers on the right only, for example.<p>One last thing: Customize you link colors. I’m also not a big fan of your color scheme, but that might be just me. 
“How it works” and “FEATURED” are a bit hard to read because of low contrast. Look at the color schemes of match.com and plentyoffish.com: light blue, light green, and pink. It’s a good thing that you’re different, but there might be a common reason behind their similar choices.<p>Your “get started” and “how it works” buttons have text-decoration: underline on hover, you might want to remove that to match the top tabs that don’t.",1259311549
963618,comment,962732,963471,0,0,flipbrad,,,">>  the possibility of starting a spin-off company is a motivator to do great research<p>There's appallingly little rational justification for what you're saying, or historical evidence. Oxford, for example, has done nothing but slip down international rankings since diverting its focus from its international academic reputation towards commercialisation. 
The science of motivation, meanwhile, seems to operate on very different lines to the ones you assume in making that statement:
<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html</a><p>In my experience researchers are already motivated to do great research - the whole citation/impact scoring system they compete in already has plenty of external motivation to add to their internal one, and unlike financial external motivation you advocate, this system is fully geared towards producing quality research
Don't forget these are often quite selfless people, and they certainly don't often have the distractions of directing their work down low-risk, high commercial viability channels. They wear socks and sandals, not suits, and do PhDs, not MBAs - and their research is just fine, thanks very much. Better they stay motivated as they are, and not have to face onerous intellectual property blocks to going about their work, than the opposite you advocate as being more productive.",1259311542

963607,comment,962873,962873,0,0,mikhailfranco,,,"Static type systems are evolving rapidly and becoming so powerful they are close to merging with algebraic specifications (e.g. OBJ, CASL). They will (soon) have type/proof systems that will become the foundation for all future engineering of large reliable systems. Why would you make an application author write unit tests on the outside of a weak language, when you can verify from inside of a strong one ? Why would you even wrap a weak language with an incomplete informal poorly specified unit test generator, when you can verify it rigorously inside the type system of strong language ?<p>Along with convergence of languages and tools, there is also a recognition that isolation of side effects and composition of operations are the fundamental mechanisms for building large software systems from reusable components, and Category Theory is the formalism for describing composition. For example, in the Haskell community there is an ongoing exploration of the compositional properties of isolation primitives like Monads, Arrows, Applicative Functors and Comonads (yeah, Category Theory terminology is a barrier to progress). Haskell is not the final language, but it is the medium in which the correct path is being discovered. I would also say the move from Java to Scala is also a step in the right direction of more powerful type systems and a (more) functional approach.<p>On the Lisp side, there has always been a cacophony of variations, and people might have had high hopes for Arc, but the future is Clojure.<p>Interesting that the two most innovative recent languages, Scala and Clojure, have been built on the JVM.",1259310485

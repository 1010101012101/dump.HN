67089,comment,67051,67051,0,0,pg,,,"Though the <i>average</i> life expectancy in medieval Europe (which is what he seems to mean by ""in history"") was about 40, people didn't only expect to live to be 40. Everyone considered the natural human lifespan to be the canonical 3 score years and 10.  I.e. 70.  They knew there was a good chance some accident or disease would nab them before that, but they didn't feel as if they were in a rush because they only had half as much time.<p>It's also an urban legend that ""centuries ago"" women matured earlier and had children in their teens.  In the Amazon rainforest perhaps.  In Europe the average age of marriage for women has been in the mid twenties for many, many centuries.  Possibly back to pre-Roman times.  The worse things were economically, the later the age tended to be.",1192234785

The first definite occurrence was in 1880, when Exeter College, Oxford rowers took the College-colour ribbons from their straw boaters and wore them as neckties (knotted four-in-hand), and then went on to order a proper set of ties in the same colours, thus creating the first example of a college necktie.""<p>Ties are only out until you aren't allowed to wear one.",1192233789

So I feel like the author may have been burned and/or confused by inheritance, and following true nerd form has cast it aside completely.<p>Sometimes when you are using a framework, the productivity gained from inheritance cannot be ignored.  I suppose this depends on the language and framework design, to a limited extent.<p>That said, I try to compose rather than inherit when possible, as it provides a more opaque implementation.",1192233770

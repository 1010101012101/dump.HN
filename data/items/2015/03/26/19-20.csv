9272629,comment,9269221,9269221,0,0,SubuSS,,,"A ton of interesting comments - let me add my opinion in there too:<p>- Intelligence IMO is two fold. Speed of processing and domain knowledge. Clearly one with a lot of the former, gathers the latter faster though. Right now - The only thing I know about your co workers is that they outweigh you greatly in latter. Considering you were hired and assuming your confidence had some reasonable foundation, the only solution here is time.<p>- I try not to allow the attitude of others to define my experience somewhere. If it gets unbearable, I just leave - but in general, our field does seem to attract a varied set of folks instead of an uniformly &#x27;nice&#x27; group. I give some bandwidth for this.<p>- getting one of them assigned as your mentor by your manager and making your success an explicit winning condition for him is a good option. Get it done ASAP.<p>- there is a little bit of ramp up here. Even a rock star team is going to have a set of work items no one wants to do because they are &#x27;manual&#x27; or &#x27;easy&#x27; or &#x27;boring&#x27; and so on. Take these up first, ace them then progress towards the core.<p>- finally, no one is going to remember your interview as much as you do. That&#x27;s a red herring. I have done about 400-500 of them, I definitely don&#x27;t remember any promises. I hired based on the amazon fit + smarts. Rest usually gets lost in the mess.<p>Good luck!",1427399940

The top forums have very active marketplaces where people are already paying money for SEO services and software. The engineering behind the products is not generally good, and many products are snake-oil. You can differentiate yourself with a product backed by quality engineering, targeting a use-case that does not directly spam the web.<p>Think something like rank trackers. Tons of those exist, none are very good. The &quot;moral argument&quot; against rank trackers is basically nil, especially compared to the moral argument against blackhat SEO services. Therefore it makes sense to enter the SEO market with a product relatively benign, like a rank tracker, instead of something like a link spammer.<p>Go to the SEO forums.

I&#x27;m not sure how much of external factors are accounted for. The economists and financial journalists are quite excited about the whole QE and ZIRP effect. It&#x27;s been deemed an unprecedented experiment. Cheap money has flooded the market. If we look at each industry of itself, most of them are in the similar state. Housing has become very expensive, stocks are at all time high, executive compensation has increased, commercial real-estate is popping up everywhere and the wealth gap is broadening. So when someone looks at statup evaluations and see them getting higher and higher, an expectation of market correction is in order just as it would be with the stock market. Perhaps the inevitable will get delayed once Euro takes up on the QE.<p>P.S: I think when someone talks about bubble, it doesn&#x27;t imply that the current crop of startup ideas are bad. It just reflects inflation in the VC market.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9259224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9259224</a>",1427399574

9272566,comment,9268904,9270478,0,0,mbutterick,,,"This is Matthew Butterick. I wrote “Why Racket? Why Lisp?”<p>As I allude there, Paul Graham’s writings about Lisp (mostly in Hackers & Painters) helped persuade me to explore Lisp languages. (Those writings have also persuaded many others.)<p>In particular, Arc&#x27;s reliance on Racket persuaded me to take a serious look at Racket. So leaving aside quibbles about what “on top of” means — is Clojure not built “on top of” the JVM? Python “on top of” C? — Paul’s choice of Racket was influential in my choice too. (As it has been for many others.)<p>As for software being “built in [one’s] head,” that seems facially true of any software. The core thesis of “Beating the Averages” is that the tool you choose to get it out of your head and into the world matters. Having now had my own Lisp revelation, I not only buy Paul’s thesis, but I even think it could be strengthened: Lisp permits the implementation of a whole category of ideas that aren’t possible in other languages.<p>Moreover, Paul wrote that essay nearly 14 years ago. Since then, Lisps have gotten somewhat more popular (Clojure has led the pack). But as I say in the article, as a group, Lisps remain way behind the programming mainstream. So ultimately, my goal is not to evangelize for Racket and exclude other Lisps. I know Racket better because that’s what I use. But more people using all of them would be a great thing.",1427399358

A simple $20 operation will restore their eyesight, which is gigantic. Alternatively, there are millions of blind people who will never be able to see. We have alleviate their blindness with a guide dog, but it costs $20k to raise and train the dog and blind person. That&#x27;s a three order of magnitude difference in cost, and the 100x cheaper operation actually cures blindless, while the 100x more expensive option &#x27;merely&#x27; makes a blind life better.<p>In other words, one person donating $100 can be much more effective (curing 5 people of blindness) than 100 people donating $200 (giving 1 blind person a guide dog). This is the sort of thing the Give Well foundation tries to approach in a data-driven manner: what is the most effective way to give. This is an extreme example, but I think it&#x27;s a really important approach to charity.<p>2) Went to my mom&#x27;s birthday today instead.

The answer to &quot;how do I pay my users?&quot; is much much harder. I don&#x27;t know the practical answer for right now.<p>For the future, though, I think the answer will be blockchain currencies (think Bitcoin) and smart contract platform/currency hybrids (think Ethereum). These will let the internet route around county tax offices, kafkaesque licensing bureaus, and (probably, sadly) a lot of pro-worker labor legislation as well.<p>You /could/ do this right now: allow users who accrue credit on your platform to cash out either in USD (or your local currency, following your local laws and regulations) or in BTC.

Once burned, twice shy.<p>I guess my point is that being &quot;100% convinced that the property had the [feature] of interest&quot; based solely on a phone call is pretty risky when you&#x27;re talking about a purchase as large as a house and a feature as important (to him) as ability to get broadband internet.  I totally understand and sympathize with his plight (I was screwed in basically the way, actually, many years ago, though it was a rental rather than a purchase, and DSL rather than cable, and it did work out in the end in that case too).   And the degree to which he was jerked around by Comcast here is almost unreal.  I could feel my blood boiling when I read the story.   But in the end, I don&#x27;t think he is going to have any actual legal recourse.  He said this was his first home purchase; I imagine next time he will insist on seeing the connection in action next time, or getting that contingency clause in if not!<p>In any case, your analogy doesn&#x27;t really fit the situation.  The seller didn&#x27;t have cable, or, presumably, any fixed broadband internet service.  (That in itself is a bit of a red flag; I&#x27;d think most households who can get internet service at a reasonable price these days already have it.)  The situation you describe -- well, it&#x27;s hard to imagine it happening, because the seller would clearly have been legally obligated to disclose that the water was from a well and not municipal, and in any case the buyer would, one hopes, have hired a home inspector who would have noted this (and probably detected issues with the well as w... umm, in addition).  But it doesn&#x27;t sound like the seller hid the fact that there was no internet service <i>currently</i> at the house, which means there&#x27;s no liability there.<p>So this is more like buying a house with no running water at all, with the knowledge that this is the case, and then getting a verbal promise from the local water company that they&#x27;d be able to hook you up.  If you were to buy a house under conditions like this, I maintain that you probably would want a contingency clause on installation of the water.<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth our cable company (not Comcast, but another big one) had absolutely no problem starting the work (once they agreed to do it) for us before we were the owner or resident.  If they had, we would simply have made the contingency something like &quot;seller is obligated to have internet installed, for which the buyer will pay, prior to closing.&quot;",1427399263

9272489,comment,9268349,9270777,0,0,samch,,,"There&#x27;s a big difference between the types of research that big pharma and academia undertake.  To be very general about it, corporate R&D is a lower-risk endeavor.  They focus on getting reasonably-well-proven ideas to market.  For them, there is always a clear end game of passing the regulatory hurdles, ramping up manufacturing, and handling distribution and marketing efforts.<p>In academia, researchers don&#x27;t typically set out with an end game like that.  They see a set of problems, and they want to test hypotheses to see if they can find ways to solve those problems.  Again, in the most general sense, they aren&#x27;t think entrepreneurially about scaling their technology or clearing various FDA milestones.  They&#x27;ve done the hard part in terms of isolating the proteins or synthesizing compounds.  Maybe they&#x27;ve even run preliminary tests to prove efficacy in certain ways.  For our researchers, their next step isn&#x27;t to cash out.  They want to get more funding for their labs to hire more postdocs to investigate more hypotheses and get more work published.  No, they never complain when their piece of the pie trickles down to them from all of the royalty splits and cost recoveries.  Still, that&#x27;s not what they live for.  We have had a few researchers make the leap to the corporate world after their ideas have been proven, but that&#x27;s definitely an exception.<p>The important part here is that these inventors never know ahead of time if their ideas will ever pan out or get of of their lab.  It&#x27;s all a big risk.  They apply for grants, the government reviews those applications, they decide if the risk is worth it based on a number of factors, and if all works out the researcher gets a chance to prove out their ideas.  This early-stage, high-risk investigation is really rare in corporate R&D.  In fact, even after some of our technologies have received traction and attention, there is often still too much risk for big pharma to jump on board.  In recent years, we&#x27;ve had to get creative with funding sources and early-stage VCs to build startups around certain technologies we believe in just to get them to the point that a bigger partner is willing to jump in.",1427398628

Since then I&#x27;ve been as heavy as 225, which isn&#x27;t enough to make people think I&#x27;m fat, but is more than I want to be.<p>When I want to lose weight, I just eat much less--typically ~800 calories per day.

I like to feel satiated, and maybe that means something different to me than it does to you. But when I need to lose weight, I just ignore hunger. Not everyone is blessed with that kind of willpower.<p>When people ask me &quot;how can I do what you did and lose 40lbs in 2 months?&quot;, my answer is just like yours--quit eating so much.<p>However if they had the choice to feel as satiated for half the calories, I expect they&#x27;d lose weight. I don&#x27;t know why you imagine they&#x27;d eat twice as much--they have no idea how many calories are in the food, typically. They eat and drink as much as they want to each day without respect to any calories. Changing diet to an already-existing high-volume, low-calorie food is not nearly as good of a solution as modifying people&#x27;s existing diet.

Far from &quot;running the planet,&quot; Castalia, the society within which the Game thrives, rather pointedly <i>does not</i> concern itself with &quot;worldly&quot; matters, being singularly focused on the life of the mind.  The Game itself is a reflection of this attitude, consisting of symbols put together to represent cross-linking through various intellectual fields, such as music, mathematics, philosophy, and the sciences.[1]  It is the main character, Joseph Knecht, who has risen to become Magister Ludi (master of the Game), who sees Castalia&#x27;s detachment from the outside world as a danger and a potential threat to its existence, and who ultimately leaves his high post to become the tutor for the son of a friend of his from school who is a &quot;man of the world.&quot;  Knecht&#x27;s perspective comes from his rather unique background, not just his friendship with the outsider, but his studies of history (a very non-Castalian field of study) with a prominent historian during a &quot;tour of duty&quot; at a monastery.  It&#x27;s a very deep book, and one which you&#x27;ll probably find new insights in every time you read it.<p>On the subject of recommendations that bridge science fiction and philosophy, might I also suggest C.S. Lewis&#x27; <i>Space Trilogy</i> ( <i>Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, That Hideous Strength</i> )? It&#x27;s another work that works on several levels. <i>That Hideous Strength,</i> in particular, is almost entirely a fictional expression of the arguments Lewis presented in <i>The Abolition of Man.</i>  There&#x27;s also a fair amount of attention devoted to linguistics; the books&#x27; central character, Prof. Elwin Ransom, was based on J.R.R. Tolkien.  And yes, there&#x27;s a certain amount of Christian philosophy in there, but on a higher intellectual level than <i>The Chronicles of Narnia.</i> A bright 14-year-old would probably enjoy it.<p>[1] Joseph Knecht&#x27;s first annual ceremonial Game as Magister Ludi was based on the dimensions and structure of a traditional Chinese house, i.e., the principles of <i>feng shui</i> in Chinese philosophy. It was routinely cited thereafter as &quot;The Chinese House Game.&quot;",1427397754

(Though in many cases they just sell simple info products)<p>The difference with Fiverr is the client often gets a deliverable that they need right then and there like a design or a video etc. A high end consultant rarely delivers something like &quot;a new website design&quot; as a product package, they&#x27;ll instead deliver a powerpoint presentation about how to approach your new website.<p>A high quality custom website design can&#x27;t be just packaged up, it takes a lot of time and effort. There are nuances and requirements that change from client to client and different levels of value contributed. Charging a single flat fee for every website would be a disaster.

We should really add these types to the functions themselves. For example:<p><pre><code>    $dbl    = function(int $x) : int { return  2 * $x;        };\n    $neg    = function(int $x) : int { return -1 * $x;        };\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ve given types to the inputs and outputs, but the functions themselves still just have the type &#x27;Closure&#x27;; there&#x27;s no indication about what they accept or return. Functions are meant to abstract, but this implementation of type hinting forces us to go and read the implementation!<p>For example, if we&#x27;ve written the following and we want to add types (where I&#x27;ve put &quot;???&quot;), we need to look at the implementations of $dbl and $neg:<p><pre><code>    $dblneg = function(??? $x) : ??? { return $dbl($neg($x)); };\n</code></pre>\nWe could implement the same functions in a different way:<p><pre><code>    $mult = function(int $x) : Closure {\n              return function(int $y) : int use ($x) {\n                return $x * $y;\n              };\n            };\n    $dbl  = $mult(2);\n    $neg  = $mult(-1);\n</code></pre>\nNow if we want to add types to $dblneg, the implementations of $dbl and $neg don&#x27;t help; we have to dig even further and read the implementation of $mult.<p>All of this would go away if we could hint the <i>function</i> instead, eg.<p><pre><code>    $mult = function($x) : Closure(int, Closure(int, int)) {\n              return function($y) use ($x) : Closure(int, int) {\n                return $x + $y;\n              };\n            };\n    $dbl = $mult(2);\n    $neg = $mult(-1);\n</code></pre>\nHere I&#x27;ve used the &quot;: ???&quot; syntax to hint <i>the whole function</i> rather than just its return value, and I&#x27;ve written &quot;Closure(x, y)&quot; to mean a function type from argument type &quot;x&quot; to return type &quot;y&quot;. This means if we have a function, like $dbl, we can query its type in the usual way (`typeof $dbl`) and get the argument and return types without having to read any source.<p>Note that this <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> require generics/parametric-polymorphism, since all of the types I&#x27;ve used are concrete. However, adding that would be the next logical step ;)<p>Note that we can trivially extend this scheme to functions with multiple arguments, in all of the various, incompatible ways PHP lets us define them:<p><pre><code>    function add($x, $y) : Closure(int, int, int) {\n      return $x + $y;\n    }\n\n    $add = function($x, $y) : Closure(int, int, int) {\n      return $x + $y;\n    };\n\n    static function add($x, $y) : Closure(int, int, int) {\n      return $x + $y;\n    }\n\n    public function add($y) : Closure(int, int, int) {\n      $this + $y;\n    }\n\n    function add($x) : Closure(int, Closure(int, int)) {\n      return function($y) use ($x) : Closure(int, int) {\n        return $x + $y;\n      };\n    }\n\n    function add($args) : Closure(array(int, int), int) {\n      return $args[0] + $args[1];\n    }\n\n    $add = function($args) : Closure(array(int, int), int) {\n      return $args[0] + $args[1];\n    }\n\n    static function add($x) : Closure(int, Closure(int, int)) {\n      return function($y) use ($x) : Closure(int, int) {\n        return $x + $y;\n      };\n    }\n\n    function add() : Closure(int, int, int) {\n      return func_get_args()[0] + func_get_args()[1];\n    }\n\n    function add() : Closure(array(int, int), int) {\n      return func_get_args()[0][0] + func_get_args()[0][1];\n    }\n\n    // and so on\n</code></pre>\nThis seems to me like another case of PHP ignoring decades of programming language research and development and instead just &quot;doing it like <popular language from the 1970s> does it&quot;.

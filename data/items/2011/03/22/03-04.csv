This is an anonymous account, due to the subject matter.<p>My Ex lives away from me, with my children.  She has no formal education she can put to use, no job at the moment, has some knowledge of some random topics, and is eager to start generating some income.  She can obviously go to school for something... but, her goal is to work from home, so she can spend the days raising our kids, and the evenings generating income.  Her technical capabilities are minimal, but mine are great.<p>My only ideas at the moment are:<p>- Marketing.  Blogging/Creating a site about something she is passionate about.  Generating income on content via Affiliate Marketing or Search.<p>- Teaching.  Holding classes in the evening about a specialized topic.  She knows a few subjects in depth, and if she was to focus on them, I believe she'd be able to start teaching them.<p>That's all I have.  The reason I posted this on here is that I'm a hacker by trade.  I've been involved in a couple startups, and have the knowledge to design/build/deploy websites/applications quickly.  I can support my family with the income I currently have, however, she wants the piece of mind that she's generating her own income (even though I'm going to play a big role in getting her bootstrapped and teaching her everything I know).<p>Suggestions/Ideas welcome!",1300766173

The first week there he was really depressed about Michael Jackson's death.  I tried to cheer him up and he perked up for a couple of days in the second week.  Then in the third week I discovered he was actively looking for work elsewhere (and telling other devs about it).  I pulled him aside and told him to pull his head in.  He came right for a while but the next week he was down again.  He broke the build every second day, and nobody ever chastised him for it (there might have been some playful ribbing along the lines of 'you broke it, you bought it') but the one time I broke the build he lost his shit and started screaming at me, telling me (in front of managers) that I was incompetent.  He had epic mood swings, when he was up he could be the most charming guy in the world, when he was down he was evil up to and including physically attacking and bullying other devs (but never in front of the managers).<p>Naturally, the managers loved him, so I left.",1300766157

Now digital cameras are terrific, and so is the Internet for showing high resolution pictures.  So, high resolution pictures.  Lots of them.<p>(2) Measurements.  When I shopped for clothes for my wife for Christmas, she wondered how I was able to buy her clothes that fit.  Easy:  In secret I went to her clothes closet, picked out some of her clothes I knew fit her well, spread them on the bed, drew a sketch, took out a tape measure and MEASURED everything relevant.  At the store, I did the same.  At a store, e.g., Talbots when they still had nice clothes for women, a sales woman came and asked me if she could help and what size I was looking for,  I explained that in clothes, especially women's clothes, the stated sizes didn't mean anything and I would use a tape measure instead.<p>(3) Colors.  Colors should just be specified in 24 bit RGB, period.  Then at home given the RGB values, use some drawing program to put up a big patch of the relevant color and compare with such data for other items already have and the color pictures.  Then can do well on color.<p>(4) Terminology.  The rag trade needs to totall stuff it on their 'creative' names that are poorly defined to anyone and just meaningless to men.  So, to say that a polo shirt is a 'pique' is nonsense.  Instead, say ""knit"" and then describe, in clear, complete English sentences and close up photographs any more of interest.<p>I went shopping for blue jeans on-line at the site of one of the famous brands, saw about three dozen colors, each with some concocted color name -- maybe New England burgundy or some such -- and gave up.  I wanted just standard blue jeans, and the color names were meaningless and the photographs were far too small to see the colors.<p>One more, the rag trade has to understand that on color, about 25% of men are partially red-green color blind.<p>Last, the rag trade has to give up on expecting men to buy clothes like women do.  Men just ain't gonna do that.",1300763842

So, use some 'authority', say, 'designers' from Paris, Milan, NYC, etc. to specify the 'new look', fill the stores with such rags and little else, and try to get young women embarrassed to be see in anything else.  And have a 'new look' each 'season'.<p>Some of the seasonal changes have lost a lot of their punch, but there's another, related idea:  Young women are easily frustrated and dissatisfied.  This is an old point, e.g,, illustrated by the two sisters in the original Disney 'Cinderella'.  Thusly, frustrated, the women want a 'MAKEover' which consists (as in 'Cinderella') of just throwing 'out the old' and 'bringing in the new'.  So, lots of good clothes are just thrown out.  Huge waste.  Men don't like that or do that.<p>For men, now, for nearly anything, including business, shirts -- polo or sport.  Pants -- blue jeans.  Shoes -- nearly anything comfortable, but actually running shoes are only for more casual situations or athletic situations.<p>If an when a suit is needed, it's easy:  There are only three colors, black, navy, and dark gray.  A pattern is okay as long as can't see it more than 2 feet away.  Shoes -- black.<p>But the effort to get men to be 'fashion conscious' will never stop and, I hope, never succeed.",1300763017

The problem in the original model, of children as machined goods, is that children are participants in their own learning/building. With a car, you just weld here, screw here, paint this, hammer that. With a child, you show, you tell, you hand hold, you do all that, but in the end it's millions of years of evolution driving a self-organizing pattern recognition cognitive system that needs to do what it does best.

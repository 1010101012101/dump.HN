And even though it wasn’t entirely their fault that manufacturers screwed this up, it reflects badly on Microsoft.""<p>That, in and of itself, seems to be almost the single point of failure on Vista. OEMs selling Vista Capable computers that don't have nearly enough memory to run Vista DOES reflect very poorly on Microsoft, and its something, that although may remedy itself as processing power improves and becomes cheaper, may not be erased from a lot of people's mind for a while.<p>As a longtime Windows user (and Apple Fanboy opponent), I certainly am almost ready to make the jump.",1211957684

201844,story,,,20,34,theyoungceo,"Ask YC: Competitor flying under us...",,"DISCLAIMER: This is kinda long, but if you take the time to read it I will buy you a karma lollipop.<p>I remember distinctly reading one of PG's maxims: Never let anybody fly underneath you. And we never have.<p>We are a low cost provider of a hotly demanded product that appeals to public/overnment clients. These particular entities usually pay anywhere between $100K and $20M to have this type of system installed, and can pay ongoing fees anywhere from $500 a month to $500K a year, depending on the size of the organization being outfitted. Suffice it to say that there is a huge market for this product...many many of these organizations all dying to have the product. We have done well with well over $500K in revenue in <2 years, no funding, and a win in a big name startup contest that netted us $100K in cash and prizes out of 250 entrants we competed against.<p>There are about 6 competitors in the space now. 2 of them are the rolls royce variety -- they don't do any contracts under $1M, have several contracts over $30M, and are public companies or owned by public companies.....they do big government only where the big federal money is, no smaller fish. We aren't really big enough to compete with these fish right now which is fine...we're hot on their tail right now and are very close to taking business away from them.<p>Two of them are in the middle....been around for 4-5 years, dabble in both big government and small government, both products fairly lackluster and way overpriced. Nonetheless, they are much cheaper than the rolls royces, so they have a smattering of clients that went with them for lack of better option over the years. We have consistently kicked the crap out of them multiple times; neither has ever beat us since we entered the market. We are way beyond them in features and way under them in price, and their customers hate them and call us all the time to switch. Lets call them the Mercedes of the world. They are the least threatening of the bunch.<p>The last two are ""startups"" and I use the term loosely. One of these startups scored several ""prestigious"" contracts before we were around, with a reallllly limited product. They were a little less than the Mercedes variety in price, but IMHO distinctly inferior in features to the Mercedes offering, which was distinctly inferior compared to us. We have had no problem beating them, but occasionally they good a get looking over because they're cheap(er) than Mercedes, but still way more than us.<p>Now to the issue at hand: the last startup. In this case we have a cornered animal. One man show, has one really small client and is barely a larvae. We knew about him, but never expected to have to take him seriously, because other clients never did and the government rarely goes with early stage startups for anything. The product is really obviously homemade, has zero features other than what we consider the one, basic, bare minimum feature of the product space.<p>We are at least a third of the way to closing up a large string of smaller government agencies that are associated with each other....we have 3 of them and there are only a few more left. One of the entities in this group is different from all the others in that they draw their funding from an atypical source and are a really ramshackle operation. They are extremely price sensitive. Their folks really love our system, and are totally sold. One thing though: they draw their funding from another department that doesn't give a crap about features, track record, quality or anything, only price. This department also doesn't have to deal with consequences of an inferior system -- they are really just Mom and Dad writing a check for junior to go play with, and are limiting him severely in his allowance. We gave them our standard pricing (which has little margin) and they welched and said semi-finally they are going with the little guy. There are HUGE risks with this because he is remote to them and we are local, and this is an on-site support type of product. We are also universes away in features and they know and are not happy about it. They are aware and objecting to the funding folks, but the funding department just doesn't care. They seem to have come about 75% of the way to a decision to not go with us.<p>So the dilemma is this: I can meet their price with little margin, and it's not a big deal, we'll still make money on the up-front but we'll make a lot less than usual on ongoing (not a problem). However, considering how closely associated potential clients X Y and Z are to this client, who are also very close to closing a deal, they might enforce the lowest available pricing on us later in the game due to us giving in on this one and really screw us. I don't think our friend the competitor has a prayer at matching us on features to X Y and Z (who are better funded and more demanding), but considering we might give this client steeply discounted pricing to beat the little guy, they might require it from us. If we don't though, it might give Junior just enough cash flow and exposure to not die, which we sure don't want to happen.<p>So, what to do! Ask follow up questions and I will try to answer.",1211957507

For one, they gave OEMs too much leeway in deciding what they could or could not slap “Vista Capable” stickers on. And even though it wasn’t entirely their fault that manufacturers screwed this up, it reflects badly on Microsoft. It’s just like when a program crashes your PC. It might not have been Windows’s fault, but you get pissed at it for not preventing it, because that’s its job.</i><p>Microsoft told the OEMs exactly what they could stamp Vista capable.

201842,comment,201819,201819,0,0,randomhack,,,"Well there are more problems than pointed out in the blog. Many of the ""problems"" cited are actually just effects of the real problems. Corporates not upgrading and OEMs offering XP are not causes themselves.<p>One problem is that the UI changed quite a bit from XP but without any added value. Why rename My Documents to Documents? Just for the heck of it?  Why change the network connections dialog? For the first time in my life, I had to spend more time setting up a wireless connection in windows than Linux. Change in UI can be good but only if the changed UI offers something new. Just renaming things or moving options around without any reason is plainly annoying.<p>Second problem is bloat. Why is the OS eating up so much RAM. Isnt the OS meant to run applications on top? Or is the OS just meant to run(or in this case limp) itself somehow. Again I dont see what Vista is doing with all that RAM. Is it doing something useful which XP didnt do? Then go ahead and use the RAM. But if it isnt, then why is it eating RAM?<p>I havent faced much problem with hardware incompatibility thankfully and as pointed out thats an issue with any OS upgrade. UAC is annoying but can be useful.<p>edit : I feel the blog only raised strawmen and then beat them up but did not tackle with the real issues.",1211957323

Its easier than you think– just THINK GREEN.<p>Gasoline consumption in the US is the largest contributor to global warming and one of the largest expenses. Top Economists at Harvard University have determined that the best way to save on gas and cut down on pollution... is ignoring red lights! Only when the path is completely safe, of course, but the gas savings from avoiding unnecessary braking and reacceleration adds up to over $20 BILLION dollars a year!<p>Being smarter at stop lights and stop signs may only boost mpg gallon by a few mpg (think about it: cars get better mileage on the highway then in the city because of less stopping and starting), but the amount saved can really add up! Here's the math: America buys 150 billion gallons of gasoline each year, and with gas at $4 a gallon an estimated 22 BILLION DOLLARS can be saved by smarter driving, saving every driving American $100 EVERY YEAR. Not to mention the time saved!<p>Even better, if less gasoline is used the laws of supply and demand force the big oil companies to LOWER THEIR PRICES. So you will need to buy less gas, and will help make it cheaper!<p>Worried about getting a ticket? If you are not endangering anyone, police will give you a free pass if you remember to mention the Think Green program.<p>So what should you do? Avoid unecessary stopping and acceleration. If at an intersection where it is safe to go but you see red, THINK GREEN and go!\nBy each of us doing our part and acting efficiently, we can reduce pollution, save time, and save some serious money at the pump.<p>So next time you are coming up to an intersection: Think Green!",1211954550

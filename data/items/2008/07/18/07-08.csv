Then the community doesn't really ""grow"".  Sure you may get some niche communities that grow, such as people who all tend to upvote cat pictures, but the ""thinking person"" doesn't have to worry, b/c as long as there is a weak (or negative) correlation between cat pictures and your upvotes, the system will never recommend any to you.<p>Imagine rather than one massive community, an infinite number of beautifully overlapping ones.  I think the ideal system would consider votes for stories and comments, and show each person mostly content that had a high probability of being enjoyed.<p>The ""new"" tab might show things with less of a strict filter to prevent false negatives.<p>The research group that built Movielens has some papers on the web and the math isn't that tough.  With a properly design collaborative filtering system there simply will not be the digg/reddit degradation where the site gets so big and noisy and low quality.  Sure there may be stories that are hugely popular, but as long as the algorithm gets enough quality input (votes) on a variety of things, no user would get too many duds.<p>Ironically Reddit's redesign only increases noise by tending people away from the subreddit niche communities that had existed -- I would more likely click on a weak title if in a quality subreddit than if it's the #4 item on the screen.<p>At the rate it's going, news.yc will surely become the next reddit, and eventually the next Digg.  As others have pointed out, we'll all have probably moved on by then to the next site (or hopefully one that implements CF!).<p>It seems odd to me that nobody has implemented a site like this with CF... As with most of my posts, if anyone wants to collaborate to do an experimental site like this just let me know.  There are some cool ruby libraries out there and of course gsl.",1216367580
249534,comment,249493,249493,0,0,antiform,,,"Having done what you're thinking about doing, I could probably write pages on the pros and cons, but I'll boil it down to probably the most important reason:<p>It's hard to go at it alone.<p>I say that if you don't have a solid cofounder who has your back, an idea and implementation that you're willing to bet your career on, or an extraordinary opportunity that won't be there when you graduate, you should get your degree first and hack in your spare time until then. If you don't have connections, a job with your name on it, significant coding experience, a compelling product, or funding, you're going to have a hard time finding work or even in convincing people to work with you.<p>That said, programming jobs and startups are much more forgiving in the education category than just about any other job. If you've got the skills and have something to back it up, then you've definitely got a shot.<p>It's not impossible to succeed, but if you don't have a way to support yourself, it's that much harder. Just know what you're getting yourself into. While you will learn a lot if you drop out and do a start up, know the opportunity costs of what you are going to do.",1216367317

I'm thinking of a way for an app to ask the server if it can render a particular set of high level primitives, if the server responds that it can, the apps sends those instead.<p>That would allow existing apps and existing display servers, new apps and older display server, and old apps and newer display servers to work fine.<p>If both the app (at the toolkit level) and the display server are recent, however, remoting is massively sped up.",1216366633

You can always go back.<p>Then again, college is to a certain extent what you make of it. You have opportunities there that you're unlikely to get again. Another option you should consider is changing majors. Astronomy or Egyptology or something that's just <i>interesting</i> with little or no direct practical application.

249519,comment,249493,249493,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"Totally agree about the work. My theory on CS work was that as long as I was learning something on a computer it didn't matter if it was for class or not. That ended up being a good theory that's served me well.<p>When I was at Odeo we did a survey of the office to see who had degrees. I'm pretty sure it was just me and the other middle manager. That's pretty sad, since the fun part of a startup is either being the decider or the doer. Of course both of us went on to start companies, so maybe it doesn't really matter.<p>Yeah, that's what I want to say. It doesn't matter in a general sense. What does matter, and I've found this to be very true as a founder, is to do things your way. There's no one set of magic advice so you just have to figure out the things that work for you. If school doesn't work for you and startup success is more important than the college social life, then drop out and go for it. If you're more methodical (like me) then graduate, join a startup, learn some lessons, then found your own company.",1216364925

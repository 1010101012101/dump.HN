This way, you learn something new rather than patching legacy code. And if your architecture doesn’t allow this yet, you can take steps to improve it, and learn some devops skills in the process.<p>In a professional environment, we develop software not because it&#x27;s fun, but because it supports the business and/or because it is the business. The primary purpose is to make money and to pay our salary. Now, that doesn&#x27;t mean that coding can&#x27;t be exciting or that you&#x27;re not supposed to have fun. Not at all.

High-level nuclear waste from spent fuel rods has three components:<p>- U-238: less radioactive than uranium ore, makes up most of the waste. Only a problem because of all the other stuff that&#x27;s mixed in with it.<p>- Transuranics, mainly plutonium: radioactive for millennia. About 3% of the waste.<p>- Fission products: the broken-up atoms. The most troublesome are radioactive for decades. About 1% of the waste. Since they have fairly short half-lives, they&#x27;re the most radioactive.<p>So it&#x27;s the fission products which make lots of decay heat and have to be kept cool, but that heat production goes away fairly quickly. It&#x27;s the transuranics that have to be stored for millennia, but they don&#x27;t need cooling; since they have long half-lives they don&#x27;t generate much heat.<p>However, the U-238 and transuranics could be used as a fuel in more advanced reactors, either fast reactors or molten salt reactors. So actually we only need to store that waste until the more advanced reactors become available.<p>In the article Thiel advocates pursuing new reactor types, including those that can eliminate long-term waste. If we do that, we&#x27;ll end up with less long-term waste than we have right now.",1448808464

But I cannot say that I was ever bored programming.<p>My favorite story about this comes from my first job, in 2000. We were working in C++, and we were turning a program designed to run in one machine into a client-server system, because nobody made machines big enough to run what we needed. The plan to do that involved replacing the old function calls with code that serialized the data, sent it over a wire, deserialized it on the other side, and call the actual function. In essence, a small bit of smart code, surrounded by a lot of boilerplate, slightly different for each function. Months of boredom looming for a team of 5.<p>But I said: Why do all that serialization and deserialization manually? What If I can just read the headers for the function calls, and generate the code that would run it all? Way too hard, our dev lead said: It&#x27;ll take us longer to write a code generator that read C++ header files than the months of boredom. I disagreed, and asked for two weeks of my time to show it could be done, with less bugs than if we did it by hand. And then when functions changed, all that we needed to do was add a step to a make file, to regenerate the whole thing. Ultimately he decided it was OK to let me try. After all, nobody expected any real output from the guy right out of school, and failure might teach him to respect his elders.<p>But it was all done in two weeks, by one person right out of school, because building a lexical analyzer,a parser, and a simple generator is easy. Instead of a team bored for months, we had fun work for two weeks, and then on to better things, without that dev lead.<p>So if you are doing something long, and slow, and boring, always wonder: Is there a way to just eliminate that entire set of boring tasks? You&#x27;ll be surprised by how often, the answer is yes.",1448808299

10644685,comment,10644295,10644573,0,0,jerf,,,"I&#x27;d rate Elixir right now only as &quot;up-and-coming&quot;. It is not yet an acceptable second-tier choice. Even in an environment where Ruby or Python (or the several other similar second-tier languages) are accepted without a second thought (as opposed to an environment where only first-tiers like Java or C(#/++/) are acceptable), Elixir will still result in some questions being asked that you better have a good answer for.<p>This is not a criticism of the language, simply descriptive of its current position. Go, which is substantially larger at the moment from what I can see, is <i>just barely</i> cracking that boundary that I described, and probably still has a good year or two before it&#x27;s quite there.<p>Elixir is currently on a good trajectory, but I would definitely be concerned that trying to be a Ruby on top of the Erlang VM is going to make it a non-trivial challenge to get to the next level of usage, precisely because the Ruby space is covered, covered, and covered again with mature, existing languages. This is, again, not a promise from me it can&#x27;t succeed, indeed I wish it all the best, just a description of its challenges. It is growing rapidly in its little niche but it may have a serious challenge getting to the next level.<p>And, back on topic, when this came up on Reddit, I&#x27;d observe that Elixir is the <i>only</i> dynamically-typed &quot;up-and-coming&quot; language I can think of. Nim is statically-typed. Rust is static. Go is probably on the way out of &quot;up-and-coming&quot; but it&#x27;s static.<p>I also observe that all the dynamic languages are all adding static type support, even when the static type support is inevitably compromised by the dynamic portion of the language. In the meantime, I don&#x27;t see any static language trying to move in a dynamic direction... in fact, many of the static languages are moving to be <i>even more</i> static! The net flow of feature work right now is <i>strongly</i> in the static direction.",1448808280

If you are boring, going somewhere exciting merely results in an exciting place now including qty one boring person.  If you don&#x27;t like your job, being forced to participate in a hackathon will result in increasing the hatred of the job not loving it.  The diversity part especially was racist, all brits are the same, all greeks are the same, there is more to diversity.  Note how that section also neatly excludes all potential employees with social lives or family lives outside of coworkers due to the relatively intense level of required coworker socialization, yet categorized that very exclusion as diversity.  This is especially striking on a holiday weekend, I had a lot of fun this weekend without a single coworker being involved, not even a phone call, so far anyway.  It would suck from a stress standpoint never being able to get away from work, or having to give up holiday family time just to put food on the table.<p>An unmentioned advantage is there is some (ugh) synergy in the two separately described issues of elimination of giant monoliths and rotation of personnel.

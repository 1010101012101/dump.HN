6467404,comment,6466935,6467326,5,0,RougeFemme,,,"And if performance is the issue, why even mention cultural fit during the firing? Items 1,2 and 4 are perfectly justifiable reasons for firing without invoking the &quot;cultural fit&quot; clause. Why not simply stick with the observations of (non-)performance rather than offering your judgements of the cause(s) of the non-performance? I can understand <i>quitting</i> because of reason #3, but not being fired because of it, <i>unless</i> it leads to poor performance. So again, fire me for poor performance, not because you believe - rightly or wrongly - that I&#x27;m not as motivated by your goals as I used to be. As long as my performance does not taper off <i>one iota</i>, it should not matter to you. And yes, for some people, loss of passion for company goals would lead to decreased performance. But other people might have additional motivating factors that allow them to maintain enthusiasm and <i>continue</i> to perform at a high level. Why should that be a problem?<p>Yes, I recognize that my refusal to accept that we must all have the identical motivating factors is a prime example of why I would be a poor cultural fit with many start-ups.",1380506303

I know pages without links degrade quicker but this isn&#x27;t what happened here.

6467392,comment,6466771,6467263,3,0,brikis98,,,"Actually, in the case of Gretzky and Lemieux, I believe they did average ~10x more points (and other contributions) per season than the average player. Also, don&#x27;t forget that the NHL is just the best of the best; there are many hockey players that are &quot;pros&quot; but never make it to the NHL. When you factor them in, players like Gretzky may be several orders of magnitude better than average.<p>>> it blows my mind to think there&#x27;s a large number of people out there who in just a few hours could knock out everything I spent all of last week on.<p>First of all, as I wrote in the post, 10x programmers are rare. There isn&#x27;t a &quot;large number&quot; of them.<p>Second, it&#x27;s not about producing more lines of code per minute or per week. It&#x27;s about producing the maximum value (for lack of a better word) in a time period by making good decisions.<p>I&#x27;m not a 10x programmer and the results on my own work week are pretty obvious: when I look at it closely, I realize that I spend a lot of time dealing previous mistakes. I lose days because I made a solution that&#x27;s too tightly coupled and it&#x27;s hard to adapt the code to a new situation; I didn&#x27;t add enough tests and waste lots of time fixing regressions; I didn&#x27;t add enough documentation and can&#x27;t remember why I made certain decisions; I&#x27;ve created designs that don&#x27;t scale and need to be replaced entirely; and so on. Since it&#x27;s harder to read code than to write it[1] and since the cost of fixing defects increases dramatically later in the software process[2], these bad decisions eat up an enormous amount of time.<p>However, as I learn more, I&#x27;ve noticed that I spend a much higher proportion of my time solving the &quot;real&quot; business problem instead of dealing with previous mistakes. In other words, I&#x27;m becoming dramatically more productive than I used to be, not because I&#x27;m typing faster, but because I&#x27;m avoiding/reducing entire branches of work that used to eat up my time.<p>These sorts of effects multiply: for the 10x programmer, the gain in productivity can be huge and they will be able to get an order of magnitude more done than the average coder.<p>* [1] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>\n* [2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Economics</a>",1380505963

It could be a sign that the team and the position is not at the same level as a ditch-digger.  Because it is a creative position, relating to communication, and working with others, unable to work with others for whatever reason (language, culture, different approaches to solving problems personality) matters. Flipping burgers, digging ditches, picking apples, selling cars, culture fit amongst the group of workers matters but not in the same degree.<p>On the other side of the argument, places shoot themselves in the foot, because of this. Because ultimately what matters most if whether the person is a net benefit for the company. Maybe their personality or age or gender or religious beliefs, or sexual orientation doesn&#x27;t match the average there but ask yourself this, is that more important than the benefit for the whole company. Young start-ups get all gung-ho on culture fit and by that I mean they want to hire 20 year old something that dress, walk, talk and think just like themselves. Each one of them hasn&#x27;t asked themselves whether they can manage to work with someone of a different gender or different age because of the experience and perspectives they bring, they take the easy route and say &quot;well they are not like us, and we are awesome, so they don&#x27;t fit&quot;.<p>Anyway, two sides of the story.

I think To-Do lists work much better when you also have &quot;time buckets&quot; scheduled on your calendar. In other words, schedule time on your calendar in which you&#x27;ll be able to complete or at least partially work on specific tasks and then use that time appropriately.<p>For example, instead of scheduling &quot;write up a proposal for so-and-so&quot;, schedule &quot;work for so-and-so&quot; and then writing up a proposal could be one of several tasks needed for that project. Instead of scheduling &quot;vacuum the downstairs floor&quot;, schedule &quot;House cleaning&quot; and then that&#x27;s just one of several tasks you could do.<p>I find that when you schedule individual tasks, it gets crazy because some things take more time and other things less time and pretty soon your life has nothing to do with what you actually scheduled.

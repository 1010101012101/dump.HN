The difference is that Nissan was trying to hit a harder goal, selling to the everyday driver, selling a car most buyers could afford. Similar to the requirements of the Volt and other electrics.<p>The i3 is a special vehicle which has too many compromises to meet stupid laws in place by various governments, the worst being a requirement to qualify as an EV its range extender cannot provide more range than its batteries. The real eye opener from BMW is the i8. The i3 is more mass market than the S, its in the range of affordability of most car drivers.<p>The key difference in the markets between the S and the rest is, the S targeted consumers whose income levels usually results in large amounts of disposable income. Levels where having an extra car or two isn&#x27;t unusual.<p>So, until they deliver on their 35k 200 mile range car, I am not going to go as far as you did in claims they are changing the game, they simply went for a more sure market.",1375977579

I.e. &quot;We won&#x27;t arrest him but he has no permission to leave the transit zone. Good luck convincing him to fly home&quot;.<p>In the same vein, even if you agree that <i>all</i> of Snowden&#x27;s disclosures are in the public interest he still broke the law, and knew he broke it.<p>If I were to take it upon myself to have shot Ariel Castro, for instance, I would likely still be charged with murder or manslaughter, even if I had known he was kidnapping women.<p>But let&#x27;s say that Snowden should be completely pardoned for leaking PRISM. The U.S. government would still have grounds to charge him for leaking details about hacking in China, which certainly did not benefit the American public.<p>And that, at this point, is all we&#x27;re talking about. Charges to be sorted out, and if some of those stick, sentences to be determined by factoring in <i>mitigating circumstances</i>. That is hardly evidence of a government rampaging through the international scene, as that is all quite standard material for extradition negotiations. Things like grounding Bolivia&#x27;s jet are examples of roughshodding! But not this here.<p>But that&#x27;s the thing. This isn&#x27;t <i>strictly</i> about rule of law. This is about Putin using the club of anti-Americanism to improve his stature at home. If Putin <i>really cared</i> about &quot;human rights&quot; then why is Pussy Riot still in prison? Why is it illegal to mention the idea of homosexuality to those poor impressionable Russian youths?<p>It&#x27;s not about human rights. It&#x27;s about politics, just as much as Republicans used to beat the drum of the &quot;welfare queen&quot; to advance their own position.<p>Accordingly, American papers are not very happy to see America used as a convenient punching bag to advance Russian interests, even where they support Snowden&#x27;s overall point about surveillance, because they realize that the world <i>is not binary</i>.",1375977573

They expect a macroeconomic contraction.<p>That isn&#x27;t necessarily true.

6179692,comment,6179163,6179520,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I think the fundamental misunderstanding here is that &quot;record profits&quot; have anything to do with executive salaries. Salaries are a cost.</i><p>There&#x27;s an association and correlation, though. It&#x27;s easier for executives to ramp up their compensation if the company is profitable. So if an executive can do something short-sighted that improves profits in the short term, or even something degenerately risky that may turn a huge profit.<p>Principal and agent usually break (that is, their interests diverge) at the second moment (risk/variance). Everyone wants profit/expectancy (first moment). There&#x27;s no tension there; who doesn&#x27;t want to make money? Risk is a nother matter. Principal usually wants as little risk per unit upside as possible; agent typically wants <i>more</i> risk because upside leads to higher compensation but the difference between a small down year and a big one is minimal.<p>For example, a hedge fund manager collects 2% of assets managed and 20% of profits. (If profits are below zero, redemptions happen and that often kills the fund.) So a return of -30 and -10 have the same effect-- shit year, no bonus, everyone gets fired-- but the difference between +10 and +30 is huge. That&#x27;s why a lot of these firms take degenerate bets. Someone else eats most of their losses, but they get a lot if they win.<p>Executives work the same way. They push for huge initiatives that add risk to the business. Big wins makes them rich, little wins make them comfortable; the difference between little losses and big losses, for them, is zero. They have no reason not to take big risks with the company.<p>Large-scale cost-cutting is especially good from an executive perspective because the benefits are immediate but the problems it causes tend to show up in the long term, giving the executive time to flee if the results are bad.",1375977174

You see more and more young children wear helmets in the Netherlands when they start out learning to ride a bicycle.<p>I&#x27;ve been riding bikes in traffic for almost 30 years and never had a serious accident one-sided or not. For about 6 years I also did cycling racing and wearing a helmet was obligatory to participate in training and official KNWU races. And that&#x27;s a good thing for I did have a number of accidents while racing: falling in the bunch, not holding a bend, jumping from small sand cliffs, breaking equipment, and so on. However, these accidents only happen because while racing one takes risks one does not while riding a bike to work: the speed is significantly lower, they way one sits on a bike is different, the stakes (i.e., winning) are lower, the bikes themselves are a lot sturdier than those racing bikes, and so on.<p>I think many foreigners don&#x27;t really understand this difference between riding for  transportation and riding for sport or challenge.<p>To add: I&#x27;ve had many more accidents, serious and not, while walking.

If you haven&#x27;t got the financial discipline to save 100 a month then set up a direct debit to take it soon after payday or whatever. Any high street bank will be happy to do this.<p>re your [2] : Can you please provide info on this? I can&#x27;t easily find info on it. I found the following:<p>&quot;You pay Income Tax on your earnings before any pension contribution, but the pension provider claims tax back from the government at the basic rate of 20 per cent. In practice, this means that for every 80 you pay into your pension, you end up with 100 in your pension pot&quot; [1]<p>First in any investment strategy it is far better to pay off any debt first. Borrowing money while saving is absurd because the interest you incur on your debt is always higher than the interest you receive on savings. And borrowing while playing the stock market is even worse. Given the recent new of most people&#x27;s debt, I suspect reducing debt should be _most_ _peoples_ concern. This includes things like checking if your mortgage agreement allows you to pay off more than the minimum to finish the mortgage early.<p>After that, you can invest up to 11,520 a year in a tax free ISA (albeit only 5,760 in cash for unknown reasons). Unlike pension income, withdrawals from ISAs are not taxed, there is no age limit, you can withdraw as much as you like, and its always your legal property. That last point is a big plus.<p>My dad paid into a company pension for 30 years. Then they went bust, and it turned out the directors had raided the pension pot. Some diretors got suspended jail sentences but that doesn&#x27;t mean they had money to give Dad though.

6179521,comment,6179163,6179163,15,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> But it strikes me as horribly short-sighted for a company to simultaneously report record profits and fire loyal employees.<p>This is an incredibly naive conclusion, one that I would argue could only be reached without any critical analysis whatsoever.<p>For one, record profits can be ephemeral. Many companies thrive and dive based on the business cycle. As we saw in 2008, the dynamics of a company can change relatively quickly, so record profits today don&#x27;t guarantee record profits, or even a profit at all, tomorrow. Building a strong cash position and/or returning capital to investors in one form or another often prove crucial to a company&#x27;s long-term ability to survive and grow.<p>More importantly, it&#x27;s critical to recognize that a loyal employee isn&#x27;t necessarily a good employee, or a necessary employee. At large companies, particularly outside of technology, you can often find plenty of &quot;loyal&quot; employees: workers who have been on the job for more than a decade who would love nothing more than to stay in that job for decades to come. <i>Some</i> percentage of these employees, however, are better at doing what it takes to secure their jobs than they are contributing to the ongoing success of the company. Others, while dedicated and hard-working, may simply lack the skills required to contribute as the company evolves. Companies are not static; as they grow and market conditions change, it may be necessary to hire in some areas, and fire in others.<p>The author of this post might as well have used the title, &quot;In tough times, abandon tough decisions.&quot;",1375975886

They expect a macroeconomic contraction.<p>Remember: profits aren&#x27;t included in the salary number, as that&#x27;s a cost. So &quot;record profits&quot; aren&#x27;t going to executives - that would be salary or options. And they usually aren&#x27;t distributed as dividends. They go into the corporate bank account, namely the rainy day fund of the company. And the reason they are going into the rainy day fund of the company is that businesses in general expect many costs to come over the next few years, from the QE tapering to Obamacare.<p>Otherwise businesses would spend those &quot;record profits&quot; on hiring and expansion, or on salary increases to retain top talent, or on acquisitions. I think the fundamental misunderstanding here is that &quot;record profits&quot; have anything to do with executive salaries. Salaries are a cost.<p>Visual analogy: this is like reducing your marginal headcount and husbanding your corn with the expectation of a massive storm on the horizon.

My strategy is to fix obvious issues early (for example UI components) and then revisit in later betas and making final fixes at gold master. I don&#x27;t care if some beta users have issues because everyone has issues on a beta.

If one compares Scala to Scheme, sure, Scheme is ridiculously simple compared to Scala.<p>But if one compares Scala to languages which are actually used in the wild like Java, C#, PHP or C++; Scala&#x27;s footprint is just incredibly small.<p>All of the features you mentioned are available in languages like Java or C#, too. The difference is that in most cases the implementation is so poor and incoherent, that the feature is next to useless.<p>I guess one just &quot;sees&quot; more language features being used in Scala, because almost everything which ships in the language makes some sense, while in Java/C#/PHP/C++ you have tons of utterly useless &quot;features&quot; which don&#x27;t add any benefit, but still force people to learn them in case somebody else used them.<p>I have never seen &quot;On a sufficiently big project with one or more extra clever developers most probably every feature will be used&quot; happen in real life.
In my experience one of the strengths of Scala is the way one can use some advanced feature where it makes sense, without having it bleed through the whole code. Compare that with Java&#x27;s, C#&#x27;s &quot;Oh, you used some complicated Generic type over there? Guess what, we will make every user suffer from it throughout your whole code base!&quot;<p>In a sense, I prefer a language (Scala) which ships with 100 features where 90 of them make sense to a language which ships with 400 features where only 50 make sense, like C# (multiply &quot;feature&quot; count by 10 for C++).<p><pre><code>  > And I don&#x27;t need a compiler to catch errors that a unit test would also catch.

You&#x27;re gonna have to have a pretty authoritative enforcement of the use of a natural language to keep it from evolving at all.<p>If someone wants &quot;proper&quot; English, they also have the Oxford Dictionary.<p>> There are more ways of saying any particular thing in English than most if not all other languages, and while you may view this as a weakness, I rather appreciate being able to decide what sounds good on my own.<p>That might be great for an English connoisseur (hey, there&#x27;s another word for a potential spelling bee), but not so much for someone who is learning the language.

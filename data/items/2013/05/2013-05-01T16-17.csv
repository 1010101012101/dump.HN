5639112,comment,5638206,5638768,5,0,glenra,,,"> I still don't get the value of twitter<p>""Talk directly to semi-famous people"" is one of the chief value propositions.<p>Suppose you are a fan of some public figure - say, an actor or a politician who has more than thousands of fan - snd you want to ask that person a question or give them a compliment.<p>If they're on twitter, there is a pretty good chance you could get through and have that person actually <i>read</i> what you have to say. If you're sufficiently witty and relevant it might even turn into a conversation. There is no other medium for which your chance of getting through is that large, and part of the reason <i>why</i> this is true is due to that 140-character limit.<p>Consider the unread messages in your email inbox. Any single email you open <i>might</i> turn out to be a quick topical one-liner, carefully edited to make a single point clearly and say nothing extraneous...but it's much more likely to be rambling and poorly edited. In the worst case, it could take an hour to read and understand a single email. So sorting through email (or any other non-bounded message stream) is daunting and best delegated to somebody else if you get too much of it.<p>The fact that tweets have to be so short forces tweeters to think carefully about what they want to say and to make their point quickly. If the message is a compliment or comment, it has to be an <i>efficient</i> one. If it's a question, it's an <i>efficient</i> question - you don't have to skim past a page of introductions and compliments and caveats to find it. And if the text is ugly or pointless or hateful, you can ""block"" the sender after you see a mere 140 characters of what he has to say.<p>So that's one use case - talking directly to people who otherwise would be protected by a circle of PR flacks. You can currently do that more effectively on twitter than most other services.<p>Even when talking to non-famous people, the 140-character limit imposes discipline that can make conversations more fun and efficient, but it only makes sense if some critical mass of the sort of people you like to talk to and hear from are already on the service, so it might not make sense <i>for you</i> yet. That's essentially a bootstrapping problem.",1367427081

He has a good point about using a line for each and/or condition in the where clause and starting with either one (easier to remove).<p>But I don't think all queries should be written in several lines.  If a query is simple enough (e.g. no aggregation, group by, having and at maximum one where condition and few fields to select), it can be written in one line, like:<p>SELECT field FROM table WHERE value = @value<p>That's easy and straightforward to understand and readable (which was initially part of SQL's goals, although we can discuss at a later date how successful that was).  Complicated SQL queries - which are bound to happen - follow - in my style - a more straightforward approach:<p>There are new lines after <i>every</i> grouping (FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, SORT BY, HAVING, etc.) and indenting.  In fact, I prefer to indent my fields twice, because I consider FROM, WHERE, etc. to be subject to SELECT (even if part of an INSERT).  I also tend to avoid extra keywords such as 'OUTER' in 'LEFT OUTER JOIN' (there is no such thing as 'LEFT INNER JOIN').  And then I follow each JOIN statement (indented compared to the ground table in from) by the table name, a new line, an indent and the ON condition.  If another table relies on that table being joined, I indent it further to indicate that, so I can quickly look at my code to see what tables goes through which (which is useful if you have a lot of relationship tables).<p>Should be noted, however, I most commonly write towards Sybase at work, which tends to have no preference - style wise - on whether you write the keywords in upper case.  My co-workers do not, so I don't either.  But when I write my own projects against MySQL/MariaDB, I use upper case.  But I generally follow the same style.",1367426937

At the far end of the food counter, a group of men who had arrived earlier were pledging allegiance to the flag, with trays of food balanced in one hand, in order to be allowed to take seats at the table. Already at the tables, a group that had arrived still earlier was singing The Star-Spangled Banner in order that they might use the salt and pepper and ketchup there. The hubub began to subside slowly as Major  de Coverley paused in the doorway with a frown of puzzled disapproval, as though viewing something bizarre. He started forward in a straight line, and the wall of officers before him parted like the Red Sea. Glancing neither left nor right, he strode indomitably up to the steam counter and, in a clear, full-bodied voice that was gruff with age and resonant with ancient eminence and authority, said:<p>Gimme eat.<p>Instead of eat, Corporal Snark gave Major  de Coverley a loyalty oath to sign. Major  de Coverley swept it away with mighty displeasure the moment he recognized what it was, his good eye flaring up blindingly with fiery disdain and his enormous old corrugated face darkening in mountainous wrath.<p>Gimme eat, I said, he ordered loudly in harsh tones that rumbled ominously through the silent tent like claps of distant thunder.<p>Corporal Snark turned pale and began to tremble.

The resistance within the die would cause different ground levels and voltage drops if supplied at only one physical location. The PCB has much more space for ""thick"" copper traces (complete ground plane) and buffer caps to supply a stable voltage across the entire die.<p>Second, CPUs have a dedicated 12V rail on the MB since quite some time. It's plugged in right near the voltage regulators of the CPU.<p>Third, a GPU die also has multiple power rails and distribution over the die as CPUs. Given the insane power requirements and transistor count, they likely have even more. The same is true for other power hungry ICs, for example high-speed DSPs, FPGAs, image sensors and so on.<p>Fourth, PCI/PCIe can't carry hundredths of watts, it would not be cost effective to kit out PCs with heavy duty connectors and thick main board traces just because one or two slots may one day be used for a space heater.

-We sell lessons for individuals or groups of 2-6 in pre-set lesson packages, each with their own per-lesson-price. Which should be displayed as the student chooses their options. With one line of code.

Someone could break into your house while you are at work and use your home computer that's turned on to log in and post as you. This internet identity is not something that you are criminally responsible for, proof beyond reasonable doubt. This is more like eliminating the need for emails and forum registrations. Yes, Google does this to some point. But it should not be a private company. It should be part of the internet. I sign in to the internet itself, and have to register with the internet provider.

Wouldn't the number of pins be somehow proportional to the power draw, as at higher currents induction would become a more severe problem? It's just usually the case that more power-hungry chips have more pins, as the 2011 socket is for Intel's flagship CPUs, the 1155 ones more commodity-oriented.<p>With the power voltage dropping below ground, that unless you had a floating ground, that'd be implying reverse flow of current, negative voltage, right?

We have over 40 million monthly users, but only 5 engineers.  That's 8 million users per engineer!<p>==Our vision==
Imagine a world where anyone can easily learn how to do anything. A world where access to comprehensive step-by-step instructions in multiple languages enables billions of people to improve their lives, in both ordinary and extraordinary ways. Thats the world we want to create.<p>==Where==
wikiHow is located in a homey office in downtown Palo Alto, California, three blocks from the Palo Alto Caltrain Station. We also have satellite offices in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington.<p>==Why were different==
* We take wikiHow's educational mission seriously. We put our mission above short-term business goals.
* We pay well. You get the joys of a nonprofit mission with a competitive for-profit salary and benefits package. 
* We have a huge number of users, but a very small team. Your work will make an immediate, noticeable impact on millions of people. 
* We all work from home one day a week.
* We don't think working long startup hours is productive or healthy. We work hard and productively, then go enjoy rich lives outside of work. 
* Our small, cohesive team is gender balanced: 50% female, 50% male.
* Were often wrong (and thats OK).  Making mistakes shows that we are innovating. We love to innovate.   
* We like walking. We even have a few treadmill desks.
* We love coming to work every day. Working with intelligent people to accomplish something globally ambitious is intrinsically satisfying. 
* We like to share. We develop open source software and Creative Commons licensed content.  
* With over 40 million readers a month, wikiHow is one of the top 200 sites on the web. Even your mom will use and love our product.
* We are profitable and growing. 
* We are self-funded. We refuse VC money on a regular basis. Investors dont make our decisions, we do. 
* We are better in person than on TV:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI</a>
* We're delightfully quirky (but you probably figured that out already).<p>=== A warning ===
Before you book an appointment with us, you should understand that wikiHow is not hoping to be acquired or looking for a quick financial exit. Our company is already profitable, financially stable (aka your job isnt going away at someones whim), and we all love working here, so we arent in a rush to sell it to some big company. In fact, we think we are doing a pretty good job running it, and selling it might mean the end to a product that we all love working on. The team here shares a passion for helping the millions of people we reach everyday. It is an amazing feeling to work on such a popular and impactful product! That amazing feeling makes us smile when we wake up every day and think about going to work. If all of this sounds appealing to you, we encourage you to apply... If this is a bummer, then thats okay too, we probably arent the best fit for you right now...and thats totally fine!<p>===Engineering at wikiHow===
We have a five-person engineering team and over 40 million users.  Thats more than 8 million users per engineer!  Everything you build will make an immediate impact on millions of people.<p>Some of the problems wikiHow engineers are working on:
* Building user-facing features for our volunteer editing community that are fun enough to gather mass usage, while simultaneously making sure the output of the work produces high-quality educational information. Its easy to get people to upload funny cat memes on the Web; the real challenge comes when you want them to create and curate the worlds best instructional content. 
* Creating features to bring in new content contributors. To keep growing and achieve our goals, we solve how to enable contributors from mobile devices, as well as continuing to gain new desktop community members.
* Scaling, scaling, scaling.  We get more users before 10 AM than most startups will get in their entire existence. 
* Big data. Lots of usage creates lots of data that we work with to further improve our products.
* Mobile and tablets. The majority of wikiHow users will soon be on portable devices, but they dont practice typical behavior patterns.  We are rethinking wikis and collaboratively created content for the mobile era. 
* Reader delight features. Better software means happier readers. Were inventing new ways to make learning pleasant and more efficient.
* Your awesome idea! We value our employees ideas and opinions, and most of our projects originate from people on the team.<p>Our stack:

5638798,comment,5636586,5636731,3,0,malandrew,,,"TBH, The only way expulsion is going to be justified is if they also punish the teachers and the principal for not providing the oversight to make sure these chemicals were not available to the kid to do this experiment in the first place. And even then I'd say the adults in charge are the ones that should be punished for this.<p>If the kid brought these chemicals to school to conduct the experiment, then I would definitely venture that there is fault with the kid here, but hardly felony territory and questionable expulsion territory. It really depends on the severity of the incident and the amount of prior knowledge the kid had about the safety. The severity should take into account both the size of the explosion and whether or not students and teachers were at risk when this experiment was conducted. Most kids who know something might be a bit dangerous or uncertain at least have the common sense to conduct these experiments in places where people are unlikely to experience bodily harm. Everyone I knew as a kid that did something like this (including myself) knew enough to guess the maximum magnitude of potential damage and made sure to conduct such experiments far enough from others. When you hear about kids playing with hardcore stuff like a homemade pipe bomb, it's usually a rural or suburban kid that goes way out into the woods to conduct their experiments. When it is something minor like strapping a bunch of Estes model rocket engines together and lighting them, they know enough to have everyone stand far enough back and behind cover before starting the fuse for the experiment. Expulsion really is only merited if humans were actually legitimately at risk.<p>They don't need to have knowledge of the experiment to be culpable, just knowledge that these chemicals were made available without adult supervision. Lab/chemical safety is no joke and I would bet that it was lax or non-existent oversight of these chemicals that prompted this. Kids will be kids. They have limited knowledge of the consequences of their actions, especially when chemistry is involved.<p>The best situation is one where chemistry can be taught safely in schools by teachers with enough knowledge and good sense to provide a safe environment. The next best alternative is to provide a limited subset of chemistry equipment and chemicals that cannot cause an explosion or serious harm, but still provide educational value. Only when neither of those two conditions can be met, should you remove lab chemistry from an educational environment. This is certainly not desirable, but still better than providing an unsafe environment for chemistry.",1367424397

Unfortunately, many 'unix' people these days have only ever worked with Linux distros. While the distro model does provide a novel approach to packaging an OS that has it's strengths, there are some downsides. I love Linux for the suppor, the rapid release cycles, and the many different approaches to things(e.g. init systems). However, sometimes I have a project that requires an OS that just works as cohesive product(eg. file server or network appliance) and FreeBSD typically fits that bill for me. The support is much more limited, but the things it does support are almost always rock solid.",1367424200

Basically it replaces the volume slider on the lock screen with a seek slider, so you can seek through your music on the lock screen.<p>I then noticed an announcement for a new tweak called LSScrubbing, which does pretty much  exactly the same thing. But it costs $1.99.<p>Mine was submitted as a free tweak, but it seems that the ""control"" file of the .deb package was altered. Originally, my tweak depended on MobileSubstrate. In Cydia, my tweak now depends on Winterboard, and is now categorized as a Winterboard theme. But it's not a Winterboard theme, it is a MobileSubstrate tweak. I don't see how this happens by accident.<p>Is this a common occurrance in the jailbreaking community? I'm new to jailbreaking, this is my first (and probably last) attempt at a tweak.<p>In any case, I'm releasing the source code on github at https://github.com/arthurrr/LSMusicSeek.git",1367424147

But if they only check a hash of the file it might be sufficient to know the hash of any file stored on Dropbox to gain access to the full file.<p>Of course, this is just a speculation and there might be more security precautions in place. Such as, e.g., sending the client various challenges about the hashes of particular byte ranges.<p>In addition, also the copyright implications of this are interesting. Consider that you've shared a directory with your friends and that you upload some copyrighted movie (that is already on their servers and not really uploaded).

Don't play games with your kids nutrition.<p>Eating meat is not at all unnatural. It's generally considered to be one of the main reasons humans could afford to evolve a larger brain - because meat is denser in nutrients than vegetarian diets.<p>Yes, you can do a healthy vegetarian diet (and even a vegan one, although at that point you really are crazy - there's no substitute for milk), but it is certainly not at all a trivial matter. It's much saner to just say ""eating meat is natural"".<p>Once you're fully grown, it's a different matter.<p>Quite frankly, anybody who tells their kids to ""don't eat meat"" is kind of crazy.

As our web framework  we use Tapestry5, which is a great framework, with fast development times & minimal coding (Howard Lewis Ship has really put a lot of thought into the development of the T5 framework). Server side our crawl infrastructure, and other application processes are all Java. We use hundreds of Java open source libraries, including HBase, Lucene & OpenJPA. Addressing your issues \n1) Lack of hosting support - we hire VPS, cloud or dedicated server infra on which we can deploy whatever we want - I don't see how this could be an issue. Even a cheap $10/month VPS gives you root these days 2) Performance issues? I won't get into a performance discussion but unless you've got google levels of traffic it's not worth worrying too much  whatever platform/language you choose, a bigger challenge early on is attracting customers ;-) I used to work in banking & Java was performant enough for our high frequency trading infrastructure, where performance really does matter. 3) We have been going 2.5 years now, a lot of what we do is server-side processing and data munching and the open source Java libraries we leveraged along the way really helped us get going, things like HBase, Lucence, Bdb, Natural Language Processing (OpenNLP), Neural Nets (Encog), Stats packages, HTML processing (Jericho, JTidy). I know there are API's and ports of these in other languages, but the Java open source community is enormous, just because it's been around for so long, so it's always easy to find someone who'se done it before.<p>EDIT (Summary): We knew Java well early on and so used it to prove a market, leveraging open source libraries along the way. Do I think Java the language was a particular competitive advantage to us? No. But do I think any of PHP, Ruby or Python would have been either? No. (Lisp - probably yes! but we don't know it well enough to use professionally). To be honest, our main concern early on is to release early and prove the market, with whatever tools we can use.",1290499320

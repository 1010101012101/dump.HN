Google can then prefetch those images or it can re-enable the optin for displaying just for those emails.<p>If I were to do email tracking, I would just filter the GMail accounts out of the statistics, because you can&#x27;t be sure of when GMail&#x27;s proxy loads those images and what you&#x27;re interested in is the conversion rate (not in the total number of people that opened their emails, you only care about totals for emails sent and clicks). But a service like MailChimp is not interested in doing this, because MailChimp is a third-party that&#x27;s interested in showing big numbers to their customers.<p>And putting these numbers aside, the privacy issues related to IP tracking, or the security issues are gone. So I think this is good.",1386975550

A handset registers when it enters a new zone. A city is typically broken down into several zones. The handset does not register itself with every new cellsite (&quot;tower&quot;) it encounters. If one&#x27;s phone stays in the same area, it will never transmit while idle.

Taligent was created by IBM and Apple to develop a set of tools and libraries like Cocoa. About the time Taligent reached about the peak of it&#x27;s mindshare, I met one of its engineers at a trade show. I asked him to create a simple application for me: A window would appear with a button, and when the button was clicked, the words &#x27;Hello World!&#x27; would appear in a text field. The engineer created a project and started subclassing madly: subclassing the window and the button and the event handler. The he started generating code: dozens of lines to get the button and text field on to the window. After 45 minutes, I had to leave. The app still did not work. That day, I knew that the company was doomed. A couple of years later, Taligent quietly closed its doors forever. &quot;",1386973527

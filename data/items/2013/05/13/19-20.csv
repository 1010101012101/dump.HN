As we have explained, supra at 23, Bowman devised and executed a novel way to harvest crops from Roundup Ready seeds without paying the usual premium.

5700946,comment,5700562,5700562,0,0,xxchan,,,"> It’s tempting to say that the lonely were born that way—it’d let the rest of us off the hook. And, as it turns out, we’d be about half right, because loneliness is about half heritable. A longitudinal study of more than 8,000 identical Dutch twins found that, if one twin reported feeling lonely and unloved, the other twin would report the same thing 48 percent of the time. This figure held so steady across the pairs of twins—young or old, male or female, notwithstanding different upbringings—that researchers concluded that it had to reflect genetic, not environmental, influence. To understand what it means for a personality trait to have 48 percent heritability, consider that the influence of genes on a purely physical trait is 100 percent. Children get the color of their eyes from their parents, and that is that. But although genes may predispose children toward loneliness, they do not account for everything that makes them grow up lonely. Fifty-two percent of that comes from the world.<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the math is wrong. Assume prior for being lonely is 50/50. Now, if 100% of twins reported that they are also lonely, this would be proof that loneliness is genetic. If it was 0%, it would imply some sadistic inverse relationship, but one that'd still be genetic. If it's 50%, the same as the prior, it means no relationship. 48% is pretty close.",1368474152

Second, perceived direction can be altered by background luminance. The local mean luminance seems crucial. On the basis of these findings, we propose that asymmetric responses of motion detectors to the jittering luminance gradient are the source of this illusion. A gradient model of motion detectors, which takes the image velocity as local temporal gradient over local spatial gradient, can predict such asymmetric responses if we assume imbalance in the positive and negative parts of temporal derivative filters. The asymmetry then depends on the DC offset of the stimulus, which explains the effect of the background luminance.</i><p>From <a href=""http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v031085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v031085</a>",1368473221

I prefer the latter, but they're both great books.  I discovered Rand later in life, after a lot of my beliefs were probably already pretty well locked in, but her outlook certainly resonates with me, and the inspiration I found in her books helps nudge me in the direction of truly to live my life more fully as <i>my</i> life, not someone else's idea of what my life should be.<p><i>The Selfish Gene</i> - Richard Dawkins.  I was already a borderline atheist anyway, although I tended to use the term agnostic to avoid arguing with friends & family, considering that I live in the Bible Belt.  But Dawkins' book showed me a counter argument to the ""irreducible complexity"" argument that made sense on a very fundamental level, and IR was one of the last things that kept even a vestige of ""mystical"" thought alive in me.  After reading this book, I felt very comfortable in being an atheist, and I also decided to quit dodging the issue and start telling people that I'm atheist, whether they like it or not.  Also, see above: I'm not interested in living a life that's about trying to please other people.  I get one crack at this, and it's fairly short.  This is my life, damnit.<p><i>The World Is Flat</i> - Thomas Friedman.  Considering that I was already a libertarian leaning, pro free-markets / free-trade type, you might think that his book would have had little impact on me.  But it actually made me a lot more aware of the various implications (pro and con) of globalization.   Largely, though, it reinforced my thinking that globalization is  - over the long term - a mostly good thing.  It will hurt some individuals in the short-term, but it also creates a lot of opportunities.<p>But beyond all those, the one book that I consider the single most life-changing book of all... the book that I'd probably refer to as my Bible if I didn't get a bit queasy about even making that joke:<p><i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> - Steve Blank.  As an aspiring entrepreneur, I had some ideas I was working on, and some plans to do a startup a while back.  But I really had NO idea of the process of going from ""an idea"" to ""a company"" much less a profitable, growing, scalable company.<p>Reading TFSTTE felt like ""taking the Red pill"".  Now I see the path from ""idea"" to ""company"" far, far more clearly than I ever did before.

If you don't have any discussions in a project, it doesn't show a ""Discussions"" section on the project overview; just a small link to ""add the first discussion"" if necessary.<p>Perhaps hide the more specialized features such as Reporting, ""On Schedule"" indicators, Clients, Invoices, due dates for projects, etc. until the user needs them for their type of project.

The problem is that this character had design and writing elements that tried to make it different from that girly princess mold, but over time those facets of the character have been removed to make a more stereotyped character. Keep in mind the original director and originator of this character, Brenda Chapman, was fired from the director role of Brave (she was the first female director for Pixar).<p>> Should she be ashamed of herself for that? Is she not a real woman, is she weak? Is she submitting to the evil male patriarchy every time she puts on a pink t-shirt or does something sterotypically girly?<p>Not at all. However, it is good to have diverse representations and there is a significant lack of representations of women that don't fall into a particular set of stereotypes and tropes. That a character that was created to be different from those tropes is being forced back into them by a corporation known for not having diverse representations of women is the issue.",1368471758

The director is not attacking women who want to bake, dress in pink, or are nurturing. She is fuming because Disney doesn't want to allow that a female character might not want ANY of that and still be feminine.",1368471753

The y axis was risk for suicide and the x axis was social interaction. The extremes of social interactions, very low or very high amounts, led to being at greater risk for suicide according to research quoted by the professor. Average amounts of social interactions had the lowest risk for suicide. I don't remember the specific studies or evidence, but it still resonates with me today.",1368471717

Stanovich. I'll quote here from a review of the book I wrote for friends on an email list about education of high-IQ children, and sum up an answer to your question in my last paragraph:<p>""For many kinds of errors in cognition, as Stanovich points out with multiple citations to peer-reviewed published research, the performance of high-IQ individuals is no better at all than the performance of low-IQ individuals. The default behavior of being a cognitive miser applies to everyone, as it is strongly selected for by evolution. In some cases, an experimenter can prompt a test subject on effective strategies to minimize cognitive errors, and in some of those cases prompted high-IQ individuals perform better than control groups. Stanovich concludes with dismay in a sentence he writes in bold print: 'Intelligent people perform better only when you tell them what to do!'<p>""Stanovich gives you the reader the chance to put your own cognition to the test. Many famous cognitive tests that have been presented to thousands of subjects in dozens of studies are included in the book. Read along, and try those cognitive tests on yourself. Stanovich comments that if the many cognitive tasks found in cognitive research were included in the item content of IQ tests, we would change the rank-ordering of many test-takers, and some persons now called intelligent would be called average, while some other people who are now called average would be called highly intelligent.<p>""Stanovich then goes on to discuss the term 'mindware' coined by David Perkins and illustrates two kinds of 'mindware' problems. Some--most--people have little knowledge of correct reasoning processes, which Stanovich calls having 'mindware gaps,' and thus make many errors of reasoning. And most people have quite a lot of 'contaminated mindware,' ideas and beliefs that lead to repeated irrational behavior. High IQ does nothing to protect thinkers from contaminated mindware. Indeed, some forms of contaminated mindware appeal to high-IQ individuals by the complicated structure of the false belief system. He includes information about a survey of a high-IQ society that find widespread belief in false concepts from pseudoscience among the society members.""<p>So Stanovich, based on the studies he cites in his book, concludes that the cognitive strategy of being a cognitive miser (using the minimal amount of information and thinking possible, even if it is too little) is such an inherent part of the human condition that external incentives and societal processes of decision-making are necessary to overcome that weakness. He has a fair amount of optimism about filling mindware gaps through educational processes that would train more thinkers in correct reasoning (as, for example, the kind of statistical training that some but not all hackers receive during higher education). He suggests that actively counteracting contaminated mindware (which is something I have a penchant for doing here on HN) is considerably more difficult, because it is precisely high-IQ individuals who are best able to defend their irrational beliefs.",1368471715

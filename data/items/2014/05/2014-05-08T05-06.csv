Let&#x27;s say that we&#x27;re implementing a distributed Actor system (or a similar message passing architecture) at the scale of Google. We&#x27;ll be using UUID to tag every message to guarantee its identity and various messaging properties (like deliver just once etc.), because UUID is unique. While actor systems can reach millions of messages per server per second, here we&#x27;ll use a humble 100k messages per second.<p>- They have over 2 million servers (2,000,000)<p>- Each of which generates 100k messages per second.<p>You reach a point of 50% collision rate (<i>for every new UUID</i>) in 3 years:<p><pre><code>    log2 (2,000,000 * 100,000 * 3600 * 24 * 365 * 3)= ~64\n</code></pre>\n2^64 is roughly the number of 128-bit UUIDs you need to reach that collision rate due to the Birthday paradox.<p>Now you might say, I have a lot of variables pegged to worst case scenario. Sure I have. But this is about 50 damn percent chance of collision on <i>every new UUID generated</i> at that point.<p>Things will become bad long before 50% collision chance if you use UUID.",1399526708

On the other hand, it&#x27;s always been custom code (like the engines themselves) and I would guess not something a lot of smaller studios would feel justified spending time on until they needed it.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true.  I&#x27;ve found that just providing some simple easy to use debug line and shape drawing that lives outside the rest of the rendering systems means people will use it for this sort of thing all the time.  After a while there&#x27;ll be a bunch of useful visualizations built up and if none of them do quite what you want, it&#x27;ll probably be easy to modify an existing one.<p>I do think Unity and Unreal both probably provide a lot of tools in this department, so the situation outside crazy developers still using custom engines is probably a lot better than I think it is.<p>Also, it&#x27;s almost certainly true that way more time goes into mundane, repetitive game testing than you thought.  The QA budgets for AAA titles are quite large, and a lot of that testing work is horrifyingly dull.

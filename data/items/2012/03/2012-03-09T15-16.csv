3684542,comment,3679266,3683563,1,0,kls,,,"Sure so for the load monitoring they had a set of tools that where required to generate a new access solution, what this did was two things it set up logging and it would link the access front end to a Oracle backend, so they where really solutioning their data in a centralized DB as opposed to the Access database, but for the most part the users did not know or care.<p>I don't remember the exact load volume but once the logging hit a specific load volume that was when they app would be sent to development for an enterprise solution. monitoring the load happens via tracking the users that connected to the oracle instance and the application id that they where connecting with, also the amount of time used was tracked. Once the app passed the load tripwire we would look at the functionality of the app, turn each discreet piece of functionality into a service on our ESB and wire the access UI to the services, also views would be created in the DB to isolate the data structure that the users created away from the services being created. from here we delivered 1.0, which is basically the same app but now the all of the functionality is delivered via services and available to the wider enterprise, what would happen after this is that the developers would start to refine the data structure and clean it up, refining out duplicate data constructs and utilizing existing functionality where available. As well, a web UI would be developed an eventually the whole solution would be delivered via web technologies.<p>Now as for the revenue tripwire that was more of a mix of accounting and other variables they measured the amount of people that used the system to the revenue it generated, and based on a formula they would deem it critical, then same process would take place. If a system tracked the revenue that it generated, which most did, we would simply wire their Access solution to the revenue reporting service on the ESB and it would be automated, for systems that did not track their revenue, we would either try to develop a way in solution to track it, or the group would be responsible for reporting it. IF it was a pure cost center, they generally waited for the load tripwire.",1331308788

Since the pirate provides the bandwidth and storage himself, the creator loses nothing through the pirate's consumption.<p>I agree that the ""why I pirate"" guy is an entitled asshole. But he has a valid critique: the people who control content distribution often act like entitled assholes as well. His basic point is that because power has shifted, he can get away with it now and they can't. With a subsidiary point being that he's not a tightwad: he's glad to spend money on digital content as long as they make it easy.<p>Whatever his (substantial) moral failings, I think his message to content creators is basically accurate: if they want to be in the business of selling content, they're going to have to pay attention to what customers want. That's good advice for anybody starting a business, and especially good advice for people who want to survive a giant upheaval.

This is because most western countries are a part of the Visa Waiver Program (I'm 99% sure Norway citizens are eligible for the VWP) which allows you to visit the US for up to 90 days at a time for business or pleasure (this means you'll have to go back to Norway for 1-2 weeks during the program and then just fly back). Whilst it's somewhat up for debate whether it's legal to use the VWP to do YC, most people do.<p>As for a place to stay, there is a fair bit of rental accommodation in the surrounding area of the YC office (Mountain View, Palo Alto, etc) and if you twist the arms of landlords of the properties (i.e. pay X amount of rent upfront), they'll generally let you get a place sorted pretty quickly.

JAX-RS is very similar to Sinatra.<p>4) JAX-WS client-side - to communicate with 3rd-party systems<p>5) JAX-WS server-side - to provide services for 3rd-party systems<p>6) Spring-Data - to reduce writing boilerplate JPA 2.x code (the way Spring Data works is as simple as writing an interface method where the method has the same name to the NamedQuery and Spring will automagically inject bytecode)<p>7) Spring library to read properties file - no need to write the actual implementation of a class that reads a property file and deal with IO exception abd opening/closing files try-catch-finally. Provide an interface and annotate the interface, set up minimal config and you're done.<p>8) Apache Derby to test the persistence layer for integration testing<p>9) Spring Web Test module - this provides HTTP Request/Response mock object so you don't have to construct your own<p>Other libraries:<p>10) FlyWay - database migration library that integrates nicely with Spring as well. Flyway is executed when you deploy your EAR/WAR to your App Server container.<p>11) GSON - Java to JSON object converter written by someone from Google. We send JSON from our Portlet MVC to the front-end that is of a mix between JSP (5-10%) and heavy JS usage.<p>12) Dozer - Object to Object mapping, very useful if you have to deal with 3rd-party systems that have a subset or superset of your internal/local domain model.<p>13) Maven - we can build for multiple environment (DEV, UAT, PROD, STAGE, etc), it's easy.<p>We are quite satisfied with the set-up and I have to say that if you come from Rails background, the only part of the stack that would make you a bit unhappy is the database ORM since ActiveRecord is probably nicer compare to the JPA 2.x/Hibernate/Spring-Data.<p>We're not using EJB yet but we may use it in the future if we have to use queue via JMS as well. To my knowledge the latest EJB (3.1) helps you a lot to deal with transactional multi-steps operations that include persistence operations and JMS operations on one execution path.<p>I'd say the code that we have to write is almost as short as Rails when it comes to the business logic part.<p>Deployment was straight forward: package it up as WAR (or EAR) and deploy it to GlassFish.<p>The part that we're lacking right now is the front-end.

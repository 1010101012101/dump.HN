That means if you used the GPL'ed version of Java on a mobile device then it becomes viral - including to any application code. (That's why most GPL'ed Java programs use the classpath exception).<p>From Sun's point of view, this was a good idea because it allowed them to protect JavaME licence revenue. Google saw JavaME as outdated, though, so instead of licencing it they took the Apache licensed Harmony project (ie, a clean room, Apache licensed version of the Java class libraries) and build Android around it.",1281679144

Additionally, as google doesn't seem to be a patent troll, it's probably also in their interest to set legal precedents that weaken software patents.<p>I mean, obviously, this doesn't mean 'always fight'  but it's another value you need to punch in to your equation, one weighing in on the 'fight' side.<p>In my business, a similar example would be the money I spend on running an aggressive abuse desk.  Running a less-aggressive abuse desk would be cheaper, both in the work it takes and in customers I've lost, at least in the short term.<p>But in the long term, /because/ I have succeeded in making my service a hostile place for spammers, my abuse complaint rate is much lower than it would be otherwise.  for a while, another VPS company rented a few servers from me... and in spite of being something like 1/60th of my size, they produced more abuse desk work than the rest of my customers combined.    I believe, because I have an aggressive abuse desk.<p>(I mean, there are other costs... I've lost at least one legitimate customer I know of, because he was compromised and his box was spewing ssh attacks over the network.  I shut him down with an email notice, the email went to the shut down box, so he never got it. )<p>my point is that there are real business reasons to fight that sometimes go beyond the immediate results of that fight.",1281678743

I process between USD$10K and USD$20K a month in paypal payments.<p>As far as I can tell, they aren't much worse than most other payment processors.  Most payment processors, if someone with bad credit comes along, or someone gets lots of chargebacks, or if someone is in a funny business sector, they keep some percentage of your money in escrow for a certain number of months.<p>Now, personally, I have a very liberal refund policy (and really, I think anyone who accepts paypal or credit cards should do the same... because anyone who wants to, with either of those methods, can get their money back, if they really want to.)  so I generally don't get chargebacks on my papal account.  My last 'dispute' in fact, was an accident... the guy says he meant to dispute the next transaction, with a different company.<p>and hell, if you tangle with the IRS, your regular bank account will get frozen.<p>Now, I have heard many, many paypal horror stories from non-profits.<p>I wonder if paypal is going overboard in cooperating with the US government (in this case, the government harassing not-for-profits who haven't lawyered up enough)  to avoid the fate of e-gold?<p>The e-gold guys, as far as I can tell, were told 'freeze your business or we will throw your asses in jail.'   I've still got around a hundred bucks in e-gold I can't access because of that.<p>E-gold was set up a the way a privacy nerd would set up a banking system, and they built a fairly secure system, but they ignored fraud, saying they were trying to be 'like cash'  and first accumulated a reputation for serving the shady and outright fraudulent market, before being shut down by the government.",1281675777

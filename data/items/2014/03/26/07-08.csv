There is nothing more depressing from an employer&#x27;s point of view than a CS graduate with no projects to show.<p>Start with small projects. It is very rewarding to finish something, even more so if you get people to actually use your work.<p>Also, software engineering is a very multi-faceted profession, that can involve much more besides programming:<p>- understanding business processes, regulatory needs, economics;\n- working closely with people as part of collecting user needs, customer support and team work;\n- education and psychology;\n- user experience and design;\n- ...<p>There is a lot of place and flexibility to find what interests you the most.",1395820675

But they have always been a big proponent of universal stories, stories which do not demean children nor sacrifice their integrity to subtextually cater to adults.

Their General Counsel issued a categorical denial not just of Arrington&#x27;s story, but of the notion that anything like Arrington&#x27;s story <i>had ever happened in any other circumstance</i>. It is very difficult to argue that they&#x27;re weaseling.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth, Google is also not Enron. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine Enron executives saying anything, because Enron was a sham business, &quot;faking it until they made it&quot; or, as it happened, fell off a cliff. Google generates tens of billions of dollars of revenue per year. They have a lot to lose. When Google&#x27;s General Counsel says something newsworthy, it&#x27;s not done casually.<p>Finally: I think it&#x27;s worth reminding people that the other side of this argument is a person who claims not to have reported on this story until a few days ago because --- despite the fact that the story was immensely relevant to the public interest, and despite the fact that not reporting it put his own sources at grave risk not merely of losing their jobs but of being sued by billion dollar companies --- to have reported it earlier would have risked the bottom line of his own publication.

Now, it&#x27;s implicit, and in inquiries to the SEC they have repeatedly said &quot;that goes against regulation&quot;.<p>The general idea behind rule 144 very sane: It&#x27;s supposed to limit pump-and-dump IPOs and M&As, by forcing anyone who did not pay for their shares outright to wait 6 months before they can gain anything (and legally, the SEC is only interested in the overall guarantee - e.g. put options that guarantee you don&#x27;t lose are AGAINST the current spirit and the former letter of the law).<p>However, the laws apply equally to someone who owns 90% of the shares (who is in a position to abuse an IPO and M&A) and 0.1% of the shares (who is likely an employee receiving RSU or options, has zero control, and likely not even any finances to draw upon)<p>The tax law is insane, the security regulations are complicated, and their interplay is ludicrously insanely crazy.<p>Whenever you see people saying &quot;oh, it&#x27;s very simple - you just didn&#x27;t get the right advice&quot; you can be sure that they have no idea what they are talking about - either they didn&#x27;t have to deal with it, or they weren&#x27;t aware they were doing something illegal.",1395818375

Much success has been seen on the Internet by doing this.</i><p>But you have to break out of this pattern to create ground breaking innovation, no? What Dave Morin is saying is that you take a particular product in a particular category and then improve it a little, and iterate over the process.<p>This only works if someone else has created that product/category in the first place. This article is perhaps about social networks, but someone must have initially imagined social networks on the internet when there were none and tried to create one. Of course it follows that innovation follows from many false starts in the same space and I can see his argument making sense for things like Myspace improving upon Friendster; and Facebook improving upon Myspace, etc. But if I come up with a better facebook (Super Normal), there isn&#x27;t any interest or mindshare because facebook has a majority mindshare and there is only a certain minority that might choose my <i>super normal app</i> vs what already works.<p>Also, this pretty much fails in a lot of real world applications. For example you could argue that people were social to begin with and <i>TELEGRAM</i> was an improvement on that process. But then the <i>TELEPHONE</i> came along. Was the Telephone an improvement on the Telegram (it&#x27;s super normal) or was it a new product category all together. Were Personal Computers the <i>super normal</i> to mathematics/games/writing or an entirely new product category?<p>I&#x27;m not sure if Dave currently reads Hacker News, but if he does (and this might be an unpopular opinion on HN) I&#x27;d like to ask him what his motivations behind continuing with Path are? Surely he is financially secure enough (w/ FB and now Path), and Path is mature enough that it could live on as a functioning experience on its users phones, but is this really his life&#x27;s mission? I mean he is smart, financially secure, perhaps has awesome friends and familial relations, but why make another social app at all? I mean how much can you optimize the user experience? What happens after you can&#x27;t optimize further? It&#x27;s not like users will jump on your platform because they find their current social apps sub-optimal. Surely smart people have some end game in mind, so in this case is it just more money?",1395817379

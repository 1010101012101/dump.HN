7081591,comment,7081405,7081405,15,0,BjoernKW,,,"Java.<p>However, think very carefully before embarking on that journey. Having an average proficiency in Java already will almost certainly get you a job in some bank, insurance company or similar enterprise-style companies. At the same time you become an exchangeable code monkey that from thereon will only be hired based on the TLAs listed in his CV.<p>In other words, your work will become a commodity and you won&#x27;t be judged by your abilities such as abstract thinking or creative problem solving any more. All that will count will be the frameworks you have experience in at any given time. It doesn&#x27;t matter that you can learn a new framework within a week. If you don&#x27;t already have proven experience in framework X when applying for a job it&#x27;s required for you won&#x27;t get that job.<p>To cut a long story short: Screw employability!",1390067913

7081572,comment,7081507,7081507,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Well, if you keep notes, then you can move on from &#x27;getting a brilliant idea&#x27; to connecting the dots between ideas that exist and the motivations for creating them.<p>The goal is to switch from &quot;getting ideas&quot; (which is sort of level 1 entrepreneurism) to &quot;seeing problems&quot; (which is, in my estimation level 2). This is important because &#x27;brilliant idea&#x27; but can&#x27;t answer the question &#x27;what problem does it solve?&#x27; is not worth spending a lot of time on, from a money making perspective (can be from a fun perspective but that is another comment).<p>So hopefully you&#x27;re keeping a diary/journal/notebook of these &quot;every other day&quot; ideas, and once you&#x27;ve got a couple dozen, maybe a hundred, you can start asking questions based on the ideas you come up with. Things like &quot;What do I spend my time thinking about?&quot;, &quot;What problem spaces are my ideas clustered around?&quot;, &quot;Given that they have been done by other people, what was it that made them obvious in retropsect?&quot;, and my personal favorite, &quot;Where is the hole in these ideas?&quot;<p>If you have the ability to generate ideas, you can leverage that into the ability to see where changes will be needed or could be presented. Sometimes existing ideas have &quot;baked in&quot; assumptions (like people assuming you&#x27;ll have a car so you need a gas mileage app) sometimes they are more subtle. If the underlying assumptions have changed (like it costs too much to make gas out of algae because oil is less than $75 a barrel) ideas that used to not make sense might start making sense, and then you look at changes that are going on around you whether it is spending habits, climate change, or population demographics, and try to ask questions about ideas those changes will make useful in the future.<p>On an unrelated topic, trying to cultivate an appreciation for &quot;learning stuff&quot; will serve you well, as it can be the only reward you get for the time invested. Appreciating the value of knowing, and knowing well the &#x27;new stuff&#x27;, will help with the motivation. If you think &quot;10 ideas, all worthless because they are already done.&quot; that is demotivating, but &quot;10 ideas, learned 10 new things, score!&quot; you&#x27;ll be much happier with the outcome. And while you may not realize it now, if you actually do <i>learn</i> the stuff that the idea entailed then you will start to recognize in your own thinking ideas that are probably already out there and more rapidly converge on solutions to problems that are unlikely to have been implemented yet.",1390067680

I&#x27;m not sure I would like the TEK, I <i>want</i> my keyboard to be a bit wider so I don&#x27;t have to squeeze my hands together. The angling avoids needing to put your wrists into constant ulnar deviation, though, which is the worst part about normal keyboards.

Ultimately, you&#x27;d have to try them and see which ones fit you.<p>As for the pedals, I use them for shift/control, which avoids having to do multiple-key chords.

I&#x27;m not talking about the kind of fluffy-tech-company-interview-&quot;knows what big Oh is and can estimate it roughly on a whiteboard&quot; ability but actually something much more concrete and formal, the kind taught in an undergrad algorithms class or in CLRS. I&#x27;ve taken those classes, I have CLRS on my shelf and have read some of it, but it&#x27;s been a long time and it&#x27;s not at my fingertips. There are exercises in the book (&quot;prove that this data structure has this amortized performance&quot;, &quot;prove that it does if you change this one thing&quot;, etc...) that challenged me quite a bit, and I ended up putting it down after a while thinking I would revisit it after refreshing my fundamentals.<p>The ML code is easy enough to follow if you know Haskell, but since the point is often to understand the subtlety of the performance characteristics of the data structures and algorithms, just reading and playing with the code wasn&#x27;t enough for me. After all you can trivially implement functional data structures naively just by copying everything on every operation.<p>Frankly, Rich Hickey&#x27;s videos on Clojure&#x27;s data structures have done a lot more for me in terms of understanding how functional data structures work, even though they are much less formal in presentation. To be clear: I think Okasaki&#x27;s book is probably a very good book and an important work, but am not so sure it is crucial for the working functional programmer to internalize all the mathematical details.<p>Anyway, YMMV.

Using something like (into #{} (f (g (h #{:some :set :items})))) manages to 1) avoid stating the target type (by using an empty set literal) 2) support processing into an existing non-empty collections and 3) avoid the overhead of re-constructing more complex data structures for intermediate steps (at the cost of lazy sequence construction), 4) is trivially extensible to new target types (implement conj) and 5) plays nice with fast transient object construction (implement transient, persistent!, and conj!). Then with reducers and monoidal operations, you can switch from sequential algorithms to parallel algorithms without paying the lazy sequence cost.<p>Scala&#x27;s model buys me what exactly?

I remember buying a book about Intuition (the AmigaOS windowing system) and trying to figure out how to call the APIs from assembly language, which was of course fruitless, as I didn&#x27;t even know how about the concept of linking, let alone how to look up library functions from assembly. Nobody had told me about C!<p>So I was a Windows person in the 1990s because that was the thing people used at home, and it was natural for me to use Delphi, not C++. I had looked at C++, but the possibility of using C++ for my projects never really struck me. Delphi was such a phenomenally productive tool. Windows seemed like the only viable platform. A lot of people are exposed to UNIX in university, but I didn&#x27;t go there, so my first taste of UNIX was (aside from Amiga) Linux.<p>I agree with you about C++. I&#x27;ve had fun writing Go, but it feels like a stopgap solution until the real next-level language appears. Rust, maybe. Nimrod does look cool.",1390065916

Not the GUI development model itself, which was brilliant and which I sorely miss for OS X GUI development today, but Object Pascal.<p>Sure, Object Pascal is a good language, but it was very insular, not portable, often very Windows-specific, didn&#x27;t integrate well with other things, and didn&#x27;t evolve fast enough. I was able to work with C and C++ libraries, including Dialogic hardware APIs and Microsoft tech such as MAPI and TAPI, by writing a translator (htrans) that parsed header files into an AST and produced Object Pascal interface files for them. But it was very tiring. I had high hopes for C++Builder, but it was a major disappointment when it arrived. For one, it relied on a lot of proprietary C++ extensions.<p>I was using Delphi/Object Pascal for a lot a systems development, non-GUI backend stuff. It seems a bit quixotic today, but it was fun, and I liked the language. It sort of filled a particular niche that Java would overtake a few years later.",1390064734

Hash tables, simple binary trees, and heaps are <i>extremely basic</i> computer science. You may never use a DIY binary tree container library, but if you can&#x27;t comfortably write a binary tree or a heap, you won&#x27;t be able to understand or implement advanced or domain-specific algorithms either.<p>This is a learning task that might take a competent developer all of 2-3 days. If you&#x27;re rationalizing not figuring out how to write a heap or a hash table, consider asking yourself whether you actually want to be a developer. You might feel OK about what you&#x27;re doing now, but a career spent redesigning unit test suites and coming up with ever- more- elaborate HTML templating schemes is unlikely to be fulfilling.",1390064623

4339617,comment,4339262,4339262,60,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"In this case, the downside to saving money by laying off expensive experience is clear. Unfortunately, the downsides are rarely clear before the upsides, and by the time the mistake is obvious, returning to the previous state is difficult, and an incentive has been created for short term savings at the expense of long term ones.<p>By way of example, several years ago I sold tools at Sears. Sears had spent decades building consumer confidence, particularly in their Craftsman brand. If you bought a Craftsman tool, and it broke for any reason, they replaced it, sans receipt. As a result, this warranty was transferable - there were no questions asked. While this policy certainly did not extend to every product sold at Sears, it did exemplify a commitment to service and quality: in the words of one older person I talked to once ""if you bought it at Sears, you didn't have to worry.""<p>As time went on, Sears was able to increase profit margins by slowly restricting the tool warranty, and using crappier parts. The obvious problem was that once Sears lost its reputation as a ""you don't have to worry about it"" store, it had to compete with stores like Wal-Mart on price[0].<p>The interesting problem here is not the Sears strategy, but the fact that it takes years for the effect of reduced quality to become obvious: in the short term, consumer confidence in the brand is still high, so the worse products are bought for the same prices, under the assumption that the quality is still high. By the time consumers on the average figure this out (when your drill wears down in 3 years instead of 10), someone that made the change has been able to demonstrate clear savings to the company and move on.<p>Several people have suggested solutions. The first one I hear thrown around is ""get rid of executives."" I think this is shortsighted in the same way that getting rid of a good IT department is. Certainly some executives are useless, but ""get rid of the bad executives"" is vacuous. A more compelling solution is to create incentive structures that encourage ""bad executives"" to be good ones, such as incentives which outweigh the short-term gains gotten by reducing, say, IT spending. For instance, I've heard it suggested that companies use long-term equity, say 15 years out. I'm not sure how that squares with moving from company to company, but it's interesting.<p>[0]This is not to say that the Sears quality-first business model was sustainable, merely that there was certainly a tradeoff, the effects of which take a long time to see in total.",1344113718

4339613,comment,4334922,4336325,1,0,SiVal,,,"If it makes you feel any better: I get my hair cut at a place here in Silicon Valley that's full of Chinese tiger moms (incl. the staff). When I was sitting in the chair a few weeks ago, a tiger mom came in the shop with a book of 8x10 photos. She went from Chinese woman to Chinese woman, holding the book open and announcing, ""This is my son. Here he is [pointing at the photos, and slowly turning the pages] at his graduation last week. He graduated from Berkeley in electrical engineering."" Then, pausing for effect, turning her head and nodding slowly and meaningfully, added, ""...with honors.""<p>She would then move down the line to the next woman and repeat the whole thing verbatim, down to the pause, slow meaningful nod, and ""...with honors.""<p>Most women she spoke to tried to look unimpressed, which I thought was a bit rude. Some even sniffed and turned away. It was amazing.<p>I was the lone white guy in a room full of Chinese women (and some kids) and apparently the only one who was happy for her and willing to look at her pictures. No luck. When she got to me, <i>she sniffed at me</i> and skipped past me to the next Chinese woman.<p>I wasn't sure whether that was because my opinion was irrelevant to her sense of social status or, more simply, that she knew the Chinese women but didn't know me.<p>I asked my hair stylist who, like most of the staff, has been a friend of mine for years. She told me that she had seen the woman a couple of times but that she didn't think anybody in the shop knew her by name. I (the only one in the room with a EE background and apparently the only one happy for her) was just not somebody whose opinion mattered to her.<p>So it seems that your Berkeley EECS is plenty good enough to ruffle the feathers of other Chinese moms and to impress me--if that helps any. ;-)",1344113653

4339601,comment,4338822,4339556,3,0,epistasis,,,"I think the issue here is precisely the concept of package management, as well as the currently used implementations on Linux. Package management is curated by people not involved in the original source packages, and the maintainers of the original open source projects do not do releases into the package management repositories.<p>And due to the proliferation of package management systems, choosing the right packages from a project's web page is quite confusing. In addition, rpm and dpkg have absolutely horrid command line interfaces, and the documentation is about as confusing as bash's man page. These are not trivial or easy to understand tools, necessitating further layers of abstraction like yum and apt. However, even these ""simple"" interfaces expose a huge amount of unnecessary complexity. If you disagree, look at the number of command line options in the rpm and dpkg utilities, and the strange and unexpected way that these command line options interact. It's not a clean system at its core. Suppose I want to do something extremely simple such as list all the packages installed on my system, how many words of the man page do I have to read and re-read before I can discover this interface? These tools share none of the simplicity of original Unix utilities, and are large monolithic beasts rather than composable units.<p>Linux package management is <i>truly</i> awesome, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have faults and that it can't be improved.",1344113300

Then, when the user PUTs or POSTs something, you instruct the various layers of your stack to read that session identifier and route based on it, directing that user's requests to a specific machine for a while  the one that is most likely to be up-to-date on what that user has recently done  instead of randomly assigning each request to a different machine.<p>Then you put a timeout on the identifier so that the user eventually goes back to using randomly-assigned machines.

4339558,comment,4335227,4336571,1,0,px1999,,,"Thanks for the explanation!  I'm usually pretty sceptical when people step outside the stuff provided by whatever framework they're building on (something which devs at my workplace are always a little keen to do, which occasionally winds up in terms of things that need to be refactored/rewritten a few months down the track in a more standard way to integrate with some other component or whatnot) - so it's a bit of a compulsive habit to try to pick apart why the framework wasn't suitable.  For MVC auth tokens though it seems to be a necessary thing to actually get a straightforward and neat solution.<p>It is a really nice solution, and I'm glad that you guys have pointed out that there's a problem and actually done something about it (""hey, just set the aspnet:UseLegacyEncryption / some other undocumented appsetting"" isn't a legit solution), and further than that, opened it up (though it all seems to have disappeared now).<p>We wound up just more tightly controlling updates (and were fortunate to be in a position that this was a solution/the problem wasn't that major), but the backup was to serve auth cookies unencrypted and add/remove the encryption via a httpmodule - after all, it isn't forms authentication that was really 'broken' IMO, it was that Microsoft kept changing the implementation of encryption all the time.  I get the impression that this could be a cleaner solution for asp.net, but definitely isn't for MVC - the next time we have to share auth tokens across multiple MVC apps / multiple instances that we don't control updates on, I'll be sure to pick up your code and run with it, so thanks.",1344111912

The disproportionate influence of those with power in the US is harmful to the interests of every part of the political spectrum, from left to right (including libertarians). With a government more beholden to the people than those in power we might not have better policies or politicians, but at least it would be 'our' fault. This the basic premise of the book I recommended. Which, by the way, was written by a former fan of Reagan and is non-partisan. Would you be so kind as to link me to specific information that you think is well researched and well written, as I have?<p>1. Oh, so you're saying that the banks were OK with the fact that Americans were still distrustful of them and keeping their money in gold rather than in banks?<p>2. Are you saying there's a global political class? Besides, the most recent (partial) nationalisation of an oil company (in Argentina) has what seems like the overwhelming support of the people.<p>3. You're really not giving me much to go on. All I have is ""absurd nationalisations of the 1970s"" which I'm now guessing refers to more stuff that happened in other countries, mostly not in ""the West.""<p>4. The size of SpaceX relative to our economy is relevant if you're trying to say the bank bailout of GM takeover is the precedent that the government will use. And the gov't didn't take a controlling stake in any of the bailed out banks. <s>But, as you say, the future is not the past, so why bother establishing precedent for something?</s><p>----<p>> after all, we know Musk didn't 'build it on his own'.<p>That you have never bothered to find out the context in which Obama said that is very telling. Here it is[0]:<p>> If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.[1]  There was a great teacher somewhere in your life.  Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive.  Somebody invested in roads and bridges.  If youve got a business. you didnt build that.  Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didnt get invented on its own.  Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.<p>So, in the sentences before what gets quoted, Obama is talking about ""this unbelievable American system"" that includes roads and bridges. And it's true that if you built a business, it's likely you did not build the roads or bridges we have today. So, isn't it reasonable to assume that Obama's 'that' referred to those same roads and bridges? Especially when his next point is that government research created the internet. If he really meant to say ""you didn't build your business"" wouldn't it have been a non-sequiter? And the gov't created the internet ""so that all the companies could make money off the internet""<p>And you can't tell me that SpaceX, of all companies, hasn't benefitted from US infrastructure. They employ former gov't engineers, they transport their rockets between LA, Texas, Marshall Islands, and Florida using roads, bridges, and ports. Paypal wouldn't have existed without the internet. Even if Musk earned his money some other way, SpaceX uses the internet and its technologies extensively. I'm sure most of their employees went to public schools at some point. They're using NASA's launch facilities at Cape Canaveral.<p>> The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.  There are some things, just like fighting fires, we dont do on our own.  I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service.  That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.<p>Pro tip: when someone says ""the point is"" what usually follows is their point. And in his main point, Obama acknowledges that success is partly due to intrinsic aspects of the individual. And he's not proposing that the government do everything, he's proposing that the government do things like provide fire fighting services[2]. The thing is, those still have to be paid for, which is why he gave that speech asking corporations to pay more taxes.[3]<p>Here is the same explanation delivered with more humor: <a href=""http://bit.ly/P2kMWC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/P2kMWC</a><p><i></i> If you're still not convinced, what would it take? <i></i><p>[0] Source of transcipt: <a href=""http://abcn.ws/MrrLdi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcn.ws/MrrLdi</a><p>[1] And there's no question that Elon Musk received help.

This was a disaster (see anecdotes below) and the problems were solved with slightly-expensive but relatively simple electronic touch-detection technology, i.e. those crazy lights that you see flashing green, red, and white.<p>I predict this will happen again. Perhaps the referee will get a little box that, when a button is pressed, simultaneously shouts ""Allez"" in an authentic French accent and starts the clock. If the clock doesn't start, the referee will stop the bout, debug the technology, and reset the clock. (Welcome to fencing, where one's kit of electronics parts is almost as important as one's weapon. ;)<p>Now for anecdotes:<p>I fenced saber (<i>terribly</i>) back when saber wasn't electrified at the NCAA level - which is to say: there was no electric circuit to detect contact between Fencer A's saber and Fencer B's target area.<p>(Saber got electric scoring last, I suspect, because the head and arms are part of the target area and you need conductive gloves and masks, which cost money, particularly because it's harder to share gloves and masks between fencers than it is to share a simple mesh vest.)<p>Moreover, at a regular-season NCAA fencing match, there's no budget for <i>five</i> impartial judges per bout, and no spare unaffilated fencers sitting around. So the rule was that we had to make touch/no touch calls <i>in matches involving our own teammates</i>. This was, to say the least, a no-win situation for a beginner. I quickly learned to pretend I was half-blind and clueless  which, alas, did not require much acting talent  and round off all non-obvious calls in favor of my teammate. To do otherwise was to earn the undying enmity of one's own team.<p>The stress drove me crazy. In retrospect, I should have demanded to be switched to foil or epee  epee, in particular, with its electronic scoring and lack of right-of-way rules, was a gloriously straightforward sport; though I would still have been a lousy fencer at least I would have lost for clear reasons  but instead I fled after one season.<p>If there's a moral to this story, it's this: There is <i>no way</i> that this incident is the most unfair thing that has happened in the history of Olympic fencing. ;) They must have been really, <i>really</i> good sports back in the old days.",1344110877

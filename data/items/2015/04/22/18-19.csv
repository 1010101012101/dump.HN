9422723,comment,9418908,9422152,0,0,trcollinson,,,"Both good points. I happen to think their algorithms are flawed, by the way, but that may be beside the point. And I think they should ponder having an appeals process, but again that is at their discretion. They are not a public service or a government agency, they are a private organization with actual concerns about the legitimacy of their user base. I don&#x27;t think they have the people-power to handle the number of requests they would get in a day. How would you suggest they change that?<p>I entirely agree that the users of Facebook are their product, and really in this case they are doing quality control. A manufacturer of widgets must check the widgets on the way out of the factory door on the way to the consumer to make sure that the widgets are in good working condition. If they are not, they must refund the consumer, or they will lose their reputation as a widget producer and potentially their entire business.<p>The same goes for Facebook. They are selling eye balls and they want to tell their customers, the advertisers, that the eye balls that they are buying are actual people and not robots, scripts, or repeats of other eye balls (people with multiple user accounts under different names_. These algorithms are a quality control mechanism, nothing more nothing less.<p>As for the question of mistreating potential customers. That is a complex question. I would say there are probably numerous companies that do not advertise with Facebook because of how they treat users. On the other hand, there are obviously enough advertisers who don&#x27;t care at all how Facebook treats their users and will throw piles of money their way to show their ads. Ultimately I would imagine that most advertisers who do spend money with Facebook want two things. First they want real, vetted users. They would probably prefer that Facebook screw up some minor tiny fraction of their users base in the hopes of cleaning up the exceptional majority of &quot;ad reading&quot; users. Second, advertisers want people who will open their ads. Click through rates on Facebook are abysmal as it is. Having real, vetted users in theory should raise they rate, not lower it.",1429729162

Building infrastructure is really expensive. They need land, licences, power, and a network to connect that tower to (assuming it isn&#x27;t just a relay).<p>So both networks have this HUGE sunk cost. In an ideal world they would be able to recruit enough users to consume each tower&#x27;s capacity by 100% at peak. But because they&#x27;re competing against other networks (with more users) and have to look competitive, they&#x27;ve over-built their network both in scope (e.g. servicing areas with few users) and capacity.<p>If Sprint and T-Mobile were confident that they could recruit enough users to fill their network they likely wouldn&#x27;t agree to this deal. Just as AT&T and Verizon haven&#x27;t. However the likely reality is that both Sprint and T-Mobile are well over capacity in certain areas and every penny that Google can bring in by stealing uses from the big two is just further helps Sprint and T-mobile, even if they just use it to further build out their respective networks.<p>Additionally: You could frame this as an &quot;illusion of choice.&quot; You have Walmart/Target Cellular (Straight Talk/Brightspot) on the low end, T-Mobile themselves in the middle, and Google&#x27;s Project Fi offering a niche service, but in reality they&#x27;re all just T-Mobile aimed at a different user base. In all three cases T-Mobile grows, their network grows, and they could kick these brands off any time the contract is up for renew.<p>PS - T-Mobile actually host just under 30(!) different cellular providers in the US[0]<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_v...</a>",1429728485

And that&#x27;s before the bottom billion people in China have an opportunity to participate in a better life. The painful reality is, there are not enough resources, savings, or consumers to lift China&#x27;s bottom one billion up to even the levels of a mid tier economy (~$15k incomes) - at least not in this century. They&#x27;re entering Japan&#x27;s debt phase of the post growth bust - the point where the country gets desperate to maintain its growth and so turns to accumulating debt - and they&#x27;re doing so before having even a mediocre social safety net.<p>When you have to take on $5 in debt to get $1 of GDP growth, your growth is over. Ten years ago their return on invested capital, and return on debt had already begun to plunge. At this point China is far beyond yielding good enough returns on the debt they&#x27;re accumulating. Now it&#x27;s merely a question of when China enters a debt panic, as all of their &#x27;growth&#x27; gets starved out due to debt obligations.<p>7% GDP growth equates to $600 to $700 billion in new GDP per year for China. They&#x27;re taking on $4+ trillion per year in new debt annually. To maintain above 5% growth, they will probably have to take on another $30+ trillion in new debt the next six or seven years alone (based on what it has taken to reach the growth levels of the last five or six years, and assuming a continued decline in return on that debt).<p>Their liquidity mess has resulted in one of the greatest stock market bubbles in history and will soon implode; 2/3 of the investors participating don&#x27;t even have a high school equivalent education level. Their real estate bubble has already begun to implode, pushing fleeing money into the new bubble in equities. They&#x27;re also bleeding foreign capital, whereas previously capital was desperate to enter China.<p>There are only two possible outcomes for China the next 20 years. A lost 20 years like Japan, for similar reasons, following the implosion of both a real estate and stock market bubble (again mirroring Japan). Or China acts very aggressively, very quickly to curb debt accumulation and to pop existing bubbles - that will result in extremely mediocre growth (1% to 3%) for a decade or two, after a period of painful contraction.",1429728011

Wealthy folks may buy land, but in this farming model it&#x27;s not the land that&#x27;s the limiting factor; it&#x27;s farmers.  And there are plenty of young people who can&#x27;t get real jobs these days that are getting pretty fed up with their traditional prospects.

The characters are extremely elaborate. Those shows feature stories that don&#x27;t rely on exhausted tropes or even deconstruct existing tropes. I think TV shows are better produced and their bigger budget is a plus which makes it more accessible to a broad audience. But when I read how avant-garde and never-seen-before the next hot TV show is, I can probably name an anime that did it before. Lately though, I&#x27;d say I probably like TV shows more and it almost seems as if animes are in a generational change, which is for the worse.<p>I may be a tad harsh about Pixar, but I think they&#x27;re merely &quot;good&quot; for adults.

9422501,comment,9422078,9422078,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The answer is that there&#x27;s a lot of passive capital in the world in pension funds for teachers and police officers. Much of that passive capital is invested in bonds and equities, but some of it gets invested into private equity, of which VC is a subset.<p>Now, what happens is that a large proportion of the passive capital ends up in Northern California. It has to be invested somewhere. In VC, it has to chase ideas. The problem is: most ideas are lame, and most people don&#x27;t have the ability to tell which ones are lame (and lame ideas can succeed in the short term: see Pets.com and Snapchat).<p>The passive capitalists are people like retired teachers in Ohio. If they voted, they wouldn&#x27;t want all of that passive capital (and the job-creating power of it) going to a small geographic area. They&#x27;d rather have it spread out more: this would mean a greater number of jobs in Ohio, and it would take the rent/housing pressure off of the Valley. Of course, what passive capitalists care the most about is returns on investment. If VC were a successful investment vehicle, then passive capitalists would favor the California concentration, and what is happening would be the right thing. The problem, of course, is that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a successful investment vehicle. VC works for the careers of the venture capitalists, and the cronies they can place in high positions, but the passive capitalists whose funds are being invested in it get utterly screwed.<p>This may answer your question and, yes, many of the startups being funded right now are bogus. However, there are some that aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not all bullshit. I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s right to be skeptical, but there are companies with genuine products and strong cultures and plausible futures.

9422481,comment,9419487,9421951,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"The only way to &quot;fix&quot; this problem is to completely abolish the institution.  The great majority of cops, including all upper ranks, would have to be permanently removed.  A new heavily emasculated entity could be created, stripped of all military overtones, with the guiding principle that the organization has no authority and no right to question its own limits or lobby for changes to them (except to impose more limits following even the slightest whiff of potential abuses, which must be reported immediately).  Only people who want to serve under those terms, and will hire others of similar disposition, could be considered for membership in the new organization.  Termination of anyone demonstrating less than total subservience would have to be immediate and unappealable.<p>Such an entity would not be recognizable as a &quot;police force&quot; to anyone currently living, as most are heavily militarized and populated almost exclusively by individuals with a pathological need to exercise absolute power over others.  But yes, in principle such an entity could be created to replace what now exists.<p>There are two major problems: first, the individuals making up today&#x27;s police forces won&#x27;t just go away, any more than piratical sailors did following the end of the War of the Spanish Succession or the Ba&#x27;athists did following the fall of their government in Iraq.  They&#x27;re still going to be somewhere, seeking unlimited power by whatever means they can, lawful or not.  Something has to be done to prevent them from reconstituting themselves somewhere else.  De-Ba&#x27;athification turned out to be harder than it looks; abolishing an institution takes more than removing its members from the public payroll.<p>Second, as most scholars probably would accept, risk-aversion among politicians is an essential failure of representative democracy.  It is usually impossible to find the political will to do anything that could lead to &quot;headline outrage&quot; later.  This is a basic feature of this form of government; simply throwing out a particular group of bums won&#x27;t address it.  No rational politician would vote to reform the police in any radical manner because any subsequent &quot;heinous crime&quot; would be dumped on his or her doorstep (regardless of whether any police force conceivable could have prevented it), and of course the former cops would encourage this process and milk it for all it&#x27;s worth.  The rational politician is interested in maximizing opportunities for reelection, not the good of humanity.<p>The two analogous historical comparisons I might make, in which public institutions were replaced wholesale with the mandate that horrific errors of the past never be repeated, are the Bundesbank and the Japanese SDF.  The Bundesbank has effectively been replaced after only a few decades by the pro-inflation ECB, and the SDF&#x27;s pacifist restrictions, after decades of being whittled away, are now under discussion for outright removal.  So the historical track record of &quot;never again&quot; isn&#x27;t very compelling, nor is the historical track record of firing large numbers of armed and dangerous &quot;public servants&quot; with limited skills and a history of supporting one another through corruption and perjury.  And we know that no representative democracy&#x27;s politicians are ever going to support such an act.  Your ideological commitment to the ballot box is laudable, but does not provide any real solution to the problem at hand, nor does it refute my essential characterization of today&#x27;s police institutions.",1429727335

9422465,comment,9422033,9422261,0,0,saidajigumi,,,"I have a lot of problems with surge pricing in general, not the least of which (in this example) is that it creates two classes of &#x27;net users: those with enough disposable income to probably not care about surge pricing <i>ever</i> and those for whom it&#x27;s a burden.  Yes, that&#x27;s a reflection on larger societal issues, but it&#x27;s still there.<p>Worse, surge pricing is often a distraction for nearly everyone.  IMO, it&#x27;s not ethical to implement surge pricing without allowing a user some mechanism to opt-out of it and to understand why they aren&#x27;t getting bandwidth at that time.  But having put that stake in the ground, the UX now requires that the user waste mental decision energy on ... business bullshit[1].<p>Last not far from least, it aligns the incentives of carriers <i>against</i> providing enough coverage to handle capacity.  We&#x27;re learning how to handle higher density wireless scenarios (cf. articles on stadium and other heavy-use event network systems).  Would we rather incentivize trickle-down of these systems into high-traffic public areas (e.g. commuter zones), or just further line the pockets of a few near-monopolist carriers at our own expense?<p>[1]  This relates to why users <i>rightly</i> don&#x27;t like metered billing -- it creates decision pressure.

Many shows suffer from the same horrible cliches and stale, one-dimensional characters that appear to be copy-pasted from story to story, and eventually you start to notice the same formulas behind some of those intricate plots.<p>Ultimately, I&#x27;m saying that one shouldn&#x27;t confuse originality with unfamiliarity.  As a Westerner, Japanese animation was unfamiliar and amazing.  Once it became familiar, much of it became less than amazing, but the good stuff was still just as good.<p>One final thought is to point out the obvious target audience age difference.  Probably due in large part to Disney&#x27;s influence, Westerners have long associated animation with children, and this makes it an apples-oranges debate.

I group it with &quot;nerd&quot; and &quot;geek&quot;, which are originally negative slang that have been more recently adopted with pride by their targets.  But I don&#x27;t expect that Spectrum would run a headline quoting &quot;Google&#x27;s Geek&quot; or &quot;Nokia&#x27;s Nerd&quot;.",1429725891

An old saying translates to something along the lines of &quot;you are the sum of who support, live, work and play with&quot;, which I find tends to hold very true.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, but haven&#x27;t been able to look up sources (someone else might chip in here) - her demands for payment (settlements) have always equated to exactly or greater than the sums owed by both her and her husband to their respective creditors.<p>Edit: I believe she was discriminated against for not being a reliable/honest/good person to work with, not because of her gender.<p>2nd Edit: Having thought about it, I now agree with /u/obstinate below moreso - her husbands dealings have nothing to do with her. We only know of our partners doings from our partners themselves, so we can&#x27;t truly be objective and tend to err on the side of trust and loyalty.<p>She felt as if she was discriminated against, so he likely supported her in her lawsuit. He&#x27;s lost his business and a home, so of course she&#x27;ll do what she can to support him.<p>I still reserve my personal opinion against both, as others will do from reading this against me.

Such businesses can identify the subsets of code which qualify for one or more of the software freedoms, i.e. they have already done the legal groundwork for source-controlled separation into different asset classes. A &quot;marketing standard&quot; for View Source would let them earn incremental returns on the already-cleared code.<p>Github would have a lot to gain from such a standard, as they are already in the code history and metadata business.  It could be prototyped with a browser extension, prior to standardization.  In time, businesses will care more about software supply chain transparency, for open <i>and</i> closed code.  A &quot;View Source&quot; standard could optionally request authorization before the source is made visible, e.g. from a private Github repo.  The value comes from the run-time coupling of source and behavior, and it can be derived from source anywhere on the licensing spectrum between proprietary and public domain.",1434595049

Management realized the potential, they let me write a better tool now with their approval. This was 10 years ago. Today I still struggle with Java and sometimes with Python but I found a handful of languages that I really like and I am focusing on getting better with those, kind of ignoring what is mainstream. I regularly fail job interviews (the last one few days ago, using codility) but I keep interviewing so I can do those better over time as well. I do one interview per week as a minimum. I try to contribute things to open source projects.  Even stupid simple things like this (<a href=""https://github.com/cloudera/hue/pull/68"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudera/hue/pull/68</a>) it is not even code, it is configuration, but we needed that few jobs back.<p>I don&#x27;t think I am particularly talented, but I spent so much effort on this (learning how to write software) that I can say today that I am a mediocre software engineer.

The ISPs in the early days had fewer customers and more competition, making them vulnerable to bad press. They pretty much had to act on any crank who complained about objectionable content hosted on their servers. ISPs today are bigger and have de facto monopolies (TWC and Comcast), so they don&#x27;t respond so much to bad press. While that may be bad news for customer service, it&#x27;s good news for the conspiracy theorist who wants to discuss which Rothschild is behind 9/11.

Want to access something other than SQLite via their database system? Well, to avoid upgrading to the $2000 price point you&#x27;ll need the $500 Client/Server add-on that also brings things like (awful) JSON support. Note you&#x27;re out of luck if you want things like HTML parsing, which still isn&#x27;t in the standard library. You have to get a subscription now to get ANY bug fix updates (!!!), so that&#x27;s several hundred more dollars. Now you&#x27;re looking at an entry fee of about $2,147 for one (niche) language which hasn&#x27;t seen a commercially published book since 2005 (seriously). And it doesn&#x27;t end there. There&#x27;s only a crippleware bundle for profiling (no 64bit support), so if you want a top, 64bit profiler that&#x27;s another pricey $600 or $800 from a third party. There&#x27;s no documentation generation support, so you&#x27;re going to need to spend $200-$300 for that from another third party (I&#x27;ve seen $300 options that can&#x27;t output PDF). HTML parsing? $60. There&#x27;s an open source mega-framework that has support for ORM and web, but if you don&#x27;t use that you&#x27;re again looking at three-digit costs for each. Want matrices and math, statistics or data mining? That&#x27;s about another $500 apiece with source code. There&#x27;s no official testing framework and the one major open source one died so now there are many somewhat-compatible options you&#x27;re going to have to hunt through on SourceForge. Oh, version control? Only full support for Subversion. There&#x27;s finally some GIT support, but only local - you can&#x27;t push to github or another central server with it. The IDE is buggy and you can&#x27;t even redefine all of the keys (!!!!!!!!!! - yes the only IDE on earth that won&#x27;t let you remap keystrokes) so you need more third party plugins that offer UI fixes, unofficial bug fixes and some remapping support.<p>It goes on and on. When I considered it for a project the cost came out to almost $5000! Instead we went full open source (including JetBrains&#x27; open source version of PyCharm) and got lots of functionality one couldn&#x27;t find at any price on the Delphi platform - which incidentally is, just now in 2015, beginning to set up package management. Unfortunately it will be tightly controlled by Embarcadero and they&#x27;ve issued all sorts of warnings about not approving code that replaces functionality in Delphi (in short, they&#x27;re afraid of competition). The community has no control over the language or the product and the diehards that are left treat it like a religion. They have something called &quot;MVPs&quot; who actually sign a contract to never disparage the language or Embarcdero! In exchange for selling their integrity they get free copies of the product. Completely coincidentally, they&#x27;ll tell you that the product isn&#x27;t overpriced. They&#x27;ll also tell you it&#x27;s used all over but no one talks about it because &quot;it&#x27;s their secret weapon&quot;. Delphi&#x27;s product manager told me that he fully believes that &quot;Delphi has had a greater impact on the business world than Python ever has&quot;. You not only have to pay all that money, you have to deal with the Scientology of programming languages. :-(<p>So no, you pay far more than for IntelliJ, you have no control over the product, you have no working roadmap, you don&#x27;t even have RELEASE DATES for new versions.

It has not always been the case that one could make such a statement and expect the majority of readers to instantly understand.  What a long way we have come!<p>I suspect, though, that we still have not come far enough to be able to deal with this problem culturally in the mainstream.  The technical solution you present would work exceptionally well along side licenses like the AGPL and would definitely be a boon to the free software community.  However, are people as eager to provide freedom to others as they are to take advantage of it?<p>I choose to mention the AGPL on purpose because it goes a fair way beyond what you propose.  It grants all 4 free software freedoms, not just the freedom to inspect code.  I could well understand if someone felt that they were very keen on the one freedom to inspect code, but couldn&#x27;t bring themselves to champion the other 3.  The problem is that many, many other people feel exactly the same way about all of the 4 freedoms.  Not only do they not see particular value, but they are actively opposed to it.<p>I think you would fight a losing battle trying to implement this in a standard.  In the same way that I couldn&#x27;t realistically expect to convince most people to use the AGPL in their web projects, despite the obvious benefits that I see, you probably could not convince enough of the powerful players to do this.  As a programmer, once you live in a world where this freedom is ubiquitous, it is obvious and even jarring when the freedom is witheld from you. As a decision maker protecting corporate interests, it is merely a matter of tradeoffs and the value is not apparently clear.  Certainly, it is not something that most people outside of the programmer community would want to encourage as the default course of action, even if they are willing to engage in it as an exceptional case.<p>Of course, I would <i>love</i> to be proven wrong ;-)",1434593914

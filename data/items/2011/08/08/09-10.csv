2859419,comment,2857214,2857926,2,0,masklinn,,,"> what precisely is the mimetype supposed to signify?<p>The meaning of the document you're returning.<p>> XML already allows you declare a schema for validation purposes.<p>But XML does not let you tag documents with arbitrary schemas. As far as I know, there is no way to include a RelaxNG or Schematron schema reference in an XML document in a standardized manner. Using specialized vendor mime types lets you provide this information: the mime type maps onto (among other things) the schema for the meta-type.<p>> It appears to me, if you really care about the content of your resource, then you should use the schema facilities provided by your encoding<p>There is nothing saying they can't go hand in hand. Indeed, it's quite the opposite: the vendor mime type you get maps directly to a corresponding schema for validation (the client generally should not validate what it gets, really, though it can).<p>> Historically, mimetypes (afaik) have never made any assumptions about the content of a resource, other than it adheres structurally to whatever the mimetype declares.<p>That's very much incorrect. See: application/xhtml+xml, application/svg+xml, model/x3d+vrml, application/soap+xml. And on the vendor-specific side of things, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml.",1312797049

Sure, it's true; he catalogs a few ways the clueless can misuse A/B tests. But you can over-weight any evaluative result. Including (cough, cough) a designer's own opinion of their  work.<p>He's wrong on one point, though: some designers definitely hate A/B testing because they don't like being proved wrong.<p>A fair number of designers apply a genius-beyond-fathoming approach to presenting designs. It works especially well for design firms; like many consulting companies they sell to people who can't really evaluate their output. As long as they act with confidence, clients think they're brilliant.<p>Those designers (whose inflexibility, lets be fair, we encouraged by putting them through waterfall hell) have a hard time adjusting to iterative processes. They have to stop pretending confidence in individual designs, and instead develop confidence in their ability to fail skillfully. They are forced to confront the fact that they aren't artists, but instead are professionals who are there to accomplish particular business goals. And they have to learn to compromise gracefully with people of different backgrounds.<p>Hating all that forced learning is perfectly natural.",1312797043

Things get more murky when you want longer-term things, like building a coherent/consistent brand, where every product/image/campaign you do doesn't wildly jump around--- imagine an Apple where every product was ruthlessly optimized in isolation, with no attention to whether it fit into Apple's larger design sense. A designer might not have the right answers there either, but the right thing to A/B test is a bit trickier, because you aren't testing decisions that are independent and easy to isolate. What you want is the overall set of decisions that maximizes 5-year profits, which might <i>not</i> be simply the sum of decisions that maximizes profit in every individual case.<p>One subset of solutions is to have someone responsible for vetoing elements of individual campaigns that might cause collateral damage bigger than the campaign's value. For example, a Disney landing page that wildly outconverts other possibilities might still get vetoed if it does something with the Disney characters that isn't in line with the image they want for them. Another is to have broader design parameters imposed ahead of time, with A/B testing restricted to a smaller set of design variables permitted to vary, like Apple does.",1312796368

(Of course, neither premise is necessarily true, this is just a baseless appeal to emotion. Who could be against ""beauty, elegance, charm, and grace""?) Can the author demonstrate from, say, ABtests.com or Whichtestwon.com that this is the case? Or did he simply have a bad experiences at highly data-driven companies? Is Netflix, for example, guilty of sacrificing ""beauty, elegance, charm, and grace""?<p><i>> Instead we get a unsightly pastiche of uneven incrementalism lacking any kind of holistic cohesiveness or suggestive of a bold, vivid, nuanced vision that inspires users.</i><p>Such as? Is the author suggesting we go with poor-performing designs because in one or a few people's opinion, they ""inspire"" users? How do you know users are inspired if their performance suffers?<p><i>> It is the implicit charter of a high-quality design team (armed with user researchers and content strategists!) to propose something a user may not be able to imagine, that is significantly better, since they are so conditioned by mediocre design in the mainstream. </i><p>IMO, it's implicit that a high quality design team could come up with 2 or more such designs, or design variations, to test. Not only that, that they would come up with such design variations to test that <i>are</i> cohesive, elegant, and beautiful.<p><i>> A/B testing may only be as effective as the designs being tested, which may or may not be high quality solutions. Users are not always the best judge of high quality design. Thats why you hire expert designers of seasoned skills, experience, judgment, and yes the conviction to make a call as to whats better overall.</i><p>Make a call based on what? Gut feel? The quality of designs being tested is not a problem of A/B testing -- if you only want users to choose from ""high quality design"", only test ""high quality design"". I don't understand the objection here. If a designer is truly an expert with seasoned skills, they should be the first to push for A/B testing of their best ideas, not retreating into vague notions of what they feel is best. There is no ""One True Solution"". Designers should own and drive the A/B testing process, not feel like they are victims of it.<p><i>> As is true with any usability test, you gotta question the motives behind the participants answers/reactions. Instead, biz/tech folks look at A/B test results as the truth rather than a data point to be debated. Healthy skepticism is alwayswarranted in any testing.

You can't wish away the data.<p><i>> A/B testing is typically used for tightly focused comparisons of granular elements of an interface, resulting in poor pastiches with results drawn from different tests.</i><p>Poor A/B testing practice may be a problem, fine, but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.<p><i>>  How do you A/B test novel interaction models, conceptual paradigms, visual styles (by the way, visuals & interactions have a two-way rapport, they inform each other, cant separate themsee Mike Kruzeniskis talks) which may vary wildly from before? </i><p>Uh, you run an A/B test and measure what you're doing.<p><i>> Would you A/B test the Wii or Dyson or Prius or iPhone? Against what???</i><p>Category error. We're talking about graphic/interaction/web design. All those companies absolutely should A/B test their web sites, for example.<p><i>> A/B testing locks you into just two comparative options, an exclusively binary (and thus limited) way of thinking. What about C or D or Z or some other alternatives? What if there are elements of A & B that could blend together to form another option? Avenues for generative design options are shut down by looking at only A and only B.</i><p>Seriously? Even basic free tools like Google Website Optimizer let you A/B/n or multivariate test.<p><i>> Finally A/B testing can undermine a strong, unified, cohesive design vision by just picking what the user says. A designer (and team) should have an opinion at the table and be willing to defend it, not simply cave into a simplistic math test for interfaces.</i><p>Sure, and not A/B testing can undermine a business by costing them thousands of dollars by not ""picking what the user says"". Pitting design teams against a ""simplistic math test"" is a silly way to polarize the issue. The designer or design team should be thrilled they have such a wealth of data at their disposal to come up with the best design possible. It's not about fighting, defending, or caving, it's about using the data to know -- and not blindly guess about -- what's going on.<p><i>> A/B test results perpetuate a falsely comforting myth that designs can be graded like a math test, in which theres a single right answer.</i><p>The author asserts this several times throughout the piece but never provide any evidence. Will they shed some light on real case studies where this happens?<p>Indeed, if there is any ""falsely comforting myth"" doing the rounds, it's that designers can guess and know what thousands of disparate users will prefer within a single percentage point of accuracy. If you can guess that well, I'd like you to pick my stocks.<p><i>> And you risk dissuading top quality design talent from joining the teams cause for good, beautiful, useful designs that improve the human condition.</i><p>Who's ""human condition"" are you improving by potentially harming client's businesses by blindly rolling out designs which may in fact cost them thousands (or hundreds of thousands, or millions) of dollars, and therefore jobs, and so on...? This is another silly, polarizing argument.<p>tl;dr: If you want ""good, beautiful, useful designs"", then A/B test ""good, beautiful, useful designs"". It's not us vs them.

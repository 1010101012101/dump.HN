No problemo.<p>>Now, it could just be my selection of friends but I think it's actually people self censoring.<p>I think that's what it is. Everyone has a reason for censoring themselves on FB. I think it's the mix of people we have on there. People in the tech community, real life friends, family, etc. Either you can or cannot get past it -- many people stick to censoring what they write. I gave up on it to an extent. I'll troll my brothers or post a YouTube video but I don't post angry statuses about someone or get all crazy on there.<p>>Finally, the idea of my posting on an internet site following me around until the end of time is revolting. I don't say anything particularly out there on HN, but if they switched to Facebook comments, I'd leave.<p>There is a similar comment on this thread that expresses this. It's understandable. I have things on the Web going back to when I was 16. I can't wait until those archives are dug up. I do enough things now that I attach my real identity to that I just had to start thinking about what I really want to say before I say it. There isn't any trolling, though I can still be brash and opinionated at times. My answer to it all was to clean up how I act. If in the future I was really dumb about something I said then at least I was sincere when I said it.",1299473906
2296087,comment,2294628,2294628,0,0,cnagele,,,"Note: I run Postmark (<a href=""http://postmarkapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postmarkapp.com</a>) where we handle delivery and bounce processing for a huge volume of email.<p>It depends on how the emails are being sent. The typical approach is to set a ""Return-Path:"" header in your outbound messages. The email that this is set to will get NDRs from receiving mail servers. You can then collect these NDRs in a mailbox or Maildir in Postfix and process them as needed. The benefit of this is having a single place where all of the messages are stored, even when sending from many FROM addresses.<p>I'd recommend a commercial tool to do this unless you already have tens of thousands of NDRs to learn against. You'll find that every mail server and ISP has something slightly different and it's very difficult to process each message accurately all the time. One example of a commercial NDR processing tool is Boogie Tools:<p><a href=""http://www.boogietools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boogietools.com/</a><p>To take this a bit further, if you are using a Return-Path header, just make sure you also setup the proper SPF and DKIM records in DNS for better deliverability. You may also want to read up on VERP.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_envelope_return_path"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_envelope_return_path</a>",1299473805

They're a hack around the lack of it, because perfect information would make a price discovery / resource allocation mechanism unnecessary: you'd just use your godlike powers and pick the best investment at the optional price every single time.

2296080,comment,2295809,2295868,0,0,6ren,,,"Just IMHO, and stated in extreme terms: I think the test is <i>entirely</i> based on the need of the market and not at all on the app.<p>That is, if you app does something that customers need to do, that they can't do, they will be delighted to have it <i>no matter how crappy it is</i> (provided it can actually do what they need). Christensen calls this ""targeting non-consumption"".<p>Bonus: if you improve it quickly, you get <i>much</i> more kudos than if it was that good in the first place.<p>However, this does not apply if your customers already have an alternative to do the job - especially if it is better than what you offer. And that's what it boils down to: you only need to be <i>better</i> than what they have now.<p>If they cobbled together their own ad hoc solution, you only have to be better than that. If they have nothing, you're OK as long as you are not ""worse than useless"".<p>> there are a good amount out there that our current benefit/feature-set would be very beneficial for.<p>Target those people. The others aren't your customers - yet. But they'll  keep on eye on you, if you keep getting better... which is expected in  technology. As long as you don't pretend to be something you're not, I don't think it can harm you. Bonus: people pay much less attention to your launch than you could possibly believe. (e.g. How many launches have you noticed?) I would also suggest that incremental word of mouth is how you really build success, not by launch. That is, don't ""hit the mainstream"", but just expand your circle, step by step. YMMV<p>One way to do this targeting is to have a roadmap, or <i>the promise</i>. This clearly states to customers what you can't do, so they won't get fooled (and they'll trust you more for being straight). And yet it also captures their mindshare, because they'll keep you in mind for when you can. Some of them might even aggressively demand, like J. Jonah Jameson, ""We need feature X <i>now</i> - when will you have it?!"" That's a good thing.<p>As I said, just IMHO.",1299473518

2296062,comment,2295742,2295956,0,0,bmelton,,,"So, the general mantra for defense contractors is that fresh college grads are hired to do work for very very cheap rates, and are given workloads that are near impossible to sustain.  The churn rate on that sort of position is very high, but the ones that last more than three or so years who are able to negotiate a decent rate will definitely end up with 6-figure salaries.<p>To put it in perspective, I'm 33, and most of the peers of mine I speak of are loosely similar in age.  That said, I had a friend of mine who was hired to the company I was working for at $40k (recent college grad, absolutely zero tech skills, but otherwise hard-charging, motivated and eager to learn) and within a year of my advice, his salary had been chipped up to $85k a year.<p>A part of it is obviously being able to market yourself personally, and a big part is actually being able to deliver -- a lot of defense / federal work is actually structured such that you can't succeed, so working against that is non-trivial -- but yeah, generally speaking, the money will come.<p>Long story short, with three years of experience and references (and a good reputation) working in contracting, you should be asking for at least $90k.

2296043,comment,2287213,2287213,0,0,nickg,,,"My thoughts on ""diet"" vs. ""exercise"": they're two pieces of the same puzzle, and I prefer to manage the ""exercise"" side of the equation more proactively. Reason is because eating in (esp. in America) today is HARD. There's a lot of crap out there, portion sizes are whack, fat, sodium and empty carbs are everywhere. And you must eat multiple times every day, so that means you make many DECISIONS about eating every single day (hundreds?). Fighting against the grain (pun intended) of what food is readily available and easily accessible is an uphill battle, filled with guilty, uncertain, and constrained decision making.<p>Don't get me wrong, I still try to eat healthy (and I'm lucky to live in San Francisco where there are more healthful options). But, the nice thing about exercise is that you only have to make ONE DECISION every day. And that is to do it. Once it's done, it's done. And it's not too hard to find a fitness activity you really enjoy doing, plus the endorphin rush you get from a good workout is amazing. When you build exercise into your lifestyle as a healthy habit, it's not even a decision anymore, it's automatic.<p>I'd much rather live a healthy lifestyle with a daily (or almost daily) fitness routine than to painstakingly count calories or awkwardly ask the waiter to 'hold the bun, please, and remove the excess butters, sugars, fats, and salts..' every time I go out to eat. That just makes it awkward for you and everybody else.",1299472674

It grows exponentially more ugly as the system increases in size. I really like continuation-passing-style as a technique (especially as a compiler IR), but doing that stuff by hand is <i>so 70s</i>.<p>I got pretty far along writing a similar system in Lua (because, hey, event-driven systems <i>are</i> pretty nice), and unlike Javascript, Lua has well-implemented coroutines - they singlehandedly eliminate a LOT of the ugly control flow management. Still, most libraries are blocking* . I eventually decided that, for small systems, an event-loop framework wasn't <i>necessary</i> in Lua (it's easy enough to just do it from scratch!), and for larger systems, I was better off using Erlang, which has the ideal foundation for that sort of system. In particular, I'm really not clear how much error-handling node.js does; that was what convinced me that Erlang's approach is refreshingly sane. When I started writing process-supervision and hot update code in Lua, I realized I was just re-implementing what Erlang does best.<p>* Which is a funny objection, like being mad that most libraries default to using decimal numbers rather than octal.

This could cut the cost of filmmaking by more than a factor of 2, especially if the first part goes easy on the special effects, the music, that kind of thing<p>There are a lot of fixed costs in movie theaters that make this impractical - you've got to get people seated and then get them out of the theater, for instance, which takes 20-30 minutes.  Given that you can't charge more than $3 for a thirty minute movie, that decrease in utilization-percentage hurts their bottom line.  Plus who is going to buy popcorn or a soda when they'll be in the theater for too short of a time to eat/drink it?  And who's going to drive to a theater to watch something that's shorter than the average TV show?<p>Not to mention, who wants to watch 30 minutes of a story and then wait a year to watch the next hour?  And I'm skeptical about people being willing to go to a movie when there's a realistic chance it'll get cut off before they see the end.<p>And many movies are still warming up at the half-hour mark - in ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", you've only just met Obi-Wan at the 30 minute mark.  You haven't seen light-sabers, X-Wings, the word ""Jedi"", Han Solo, the Death Star, or the Millennium Falcon yet.  In ""Back to the Future"", you're only just going back in time at that point.  In the remake of King Kong, you don't even see Kong until like an hour into the film.  At 30 minutes into Gladiator, you're still a good 20-30 minutes from seeing the inside of an Arena.  At 30 minutes into Fellowship of the Ring, you've still met like half of the Fellowship.  You'd have to rework the whole scripting paradigm if you want an accurate representation of what the film's about in that 30-minute episode.<p>>Instead of a pilot episode or abridged movie, do the first installment of the movie as a comic book.<p>This will lead to a very biased output, as only a subset of the movie-going population reads comic books.<p>>Don't spend anything on marketing. Release films in a single theater or a single city. If it takes off, print more copies. If GQ is to be believed, this would cut the cost of filmmaking in half, which would mean you could make twice as many movies.<p>With this approach, you've really got to hope that word-of-mouth generators like film blogs like the movie or that everyone in the audience is an active Tweeter.  And you've really got to hope that everyone in your target audience is an active Web 2.0 user or has a close friend who is.",1299471771

  2. Do something after the long-running task has completed
</code></pre>
Node.js' callback function convention simply makes it stupendously easy for you to write code for both cases, and leans towards making case (1) as natural as possible. Case (2) is naturally easy in Javascript (and even easier in Coffeescript) because of the way Javascript supports closures.<p><pre><code>  application = function() {
    // do stuff
    database_call( options, function(err, callback) { // javascript closure
      // case (2) logic
    } );
    // case (1) logic
  }
</code></pre>
How does Tora fare on this regard? Node.js is about parallelism through forking closures, not any solution to long running CPU intensive tasks.<p>The weakpoints of Node.js, in my opinion (and please correct me if I'm wrong, that would make me happy), is having to write a lot of boilerplate code for error and exception handling. Exception handling is particularly onerous because depending on the function call you'll never know which stack the exception will travel up. In the example above, you (probably) can't catch an exception from case (2) by wrapping the database_call in a try-catch block. Does anyone have a good solution to this?<p>All-in-all, I like that Node.js tries to stay pure by enforcing the above convention. Noders who stay in ""userland"" can't shoot themselves in the foot by making an asynchronous procedure synchronous, which may lead to faster code overall.",1299471300

I would argue that it encourages authenticity.<p>One interesting thing that facebook commenting seems to have done is connect people based on mutual interest.

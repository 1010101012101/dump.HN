I even made a note in my calendar for April 2009 that your book was coming out and I need to buy it.  (this was when it was on your blog last week).<p>I would see if you can get on ""geek"" media: geek.tv, NPR's Science Friday, etc.  Science Friday had a 20 minute talk with the people that wrote ""My Nuclear Family Vacation"" where they visited nuclear history sites.<p>Not sure if it's in the budget, but you should go to any of the places you can and do a little 2 min video about it, with info about the book in the fade-out.  Put them on youtube and on the book site.<p>Definitely have a site for the book, preferably with a decent blog.  This lets people find out more about the book and lets you give periodic reminders that it exists and should be bought.  See ""Permission Marketing"" for more details.<p>Anyways, good luck and I can't wait until it comes out in April!",1228127555

381563,comment,381453,381453,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"I think you're trying to solve a valid problem - i.e. allowing Excel type data to be manipulated/formatted more easily than Excel (or similar tools) currently allow. And I think you have a cool product, but...<p>But I don't think this is a solution to that problem for <i>most people</i> who have that problem.<p>My previous job involved <i>a lot</i> of Excel work (so I became fairly good at it) and it also involved interacting with people (often clients) who used Excel occasionally and really werent very proficient at using it. So for simplicity, lets imagine the world of excel users is made up entirely of those two types, and lets call them A and B respectively.<p>Types As don't need this service - they can do all the things you showed in Excel quickly (using keyboard shortcuts etc), using formatting codes (even though Excel format codes are clunky. eg. SSN format code is: ###-##-####).<p>Type Bs do need your service. But will they use it? If they use Excel rarely then is it worth the overhead of knowing how to use a separate service (even a simple one)? If they can't figure out how to use Excel codes then are they the <i>type of person</i> who will be interested in exploring new services? (note, this is about the <i>type</i> of person, not about how simple <i>your service</i> is)<p>OK, so the world of Excel users is not as simple as the A/B world that I describe. There is no doubt another type C somewhere between the two who might value this - but how many of those are there? My gut says 'not many', but I don't have data. Can you describe to me your archetypal customer?<p>Making this an Excel plug-in might solve this overhead problem somewhat, but even then, the latter issue still remains.",1228126399

381557,comment,381453,381453,0,0,mwinters58,,,"The examples are pretty basic and can be done with  4-5 excel functions and no scripting. Do you guys have any heavier duty examples in the works?<p>What market are you going after? Soccer moms managing team phonebooks? Entrepreneurs who have other things to worry about than cleaning up data?<p>It'd be cool to see see prompts that inspire better uses/structure to your data. E.g. if a company is managing their sales pipeline (as in the dabble db 8 min demo), analyze that data further than excel easily allows.. track how the data changes over time to deliver insights that people wouldn't see by just producing graphs. 
What common trends exist among sales that actually close? How long does a sale stay on the table before closing? Does this vary by salesperson/location?<p>It makes sense for people who know little about spreadsheets [like my mom who would manually add dashes to dozens of rows :) ], but they may also be the type who wouldn't think to seek out a web app to help them clean up the data.<p>I'm probably a poor sample b/c I spend 5-6 hours/day in excel (finance @ tech company).<p>Color-logo feature is sweet!",1228125800
381556,comment,379460,379460,0,0,jfjfjf,,,"I disagree with the claim that harm to the U.S. IPO market was ""not the intention"" of the ""people who wrote"" Sarbanes-Oxley.<p>I have two pieces of evidence.<p>First, it was well-known and easy to see that Sarbanes-Oxley would be extremely expensive. It was well-known when passed that its costs fall disproportionately on small public companies. Because IPOs by definition are small public companies, the costs fall disproportionately on them. Thus, it must have been known when enacted that the bill would harm IPOs.<p>Second, suppose in fact it is the case, as Graham seems to advocate, that Congress ""inadvertently"" harmed IPOs. His argument is that Congress just accidently happened to overlook the harm of the bill to IPOs. In that case, when the harm to IPOs became factually clear, the bill would have been changed or amended. The fact that the law was not amended even after the harm to IPOs became clear proves that it was Congress' intention all along to harm small public companies (the companies most dangerous to the large corporations who have the most lobbying pull).",1228125715

3801814,comment,3801631,3801631,10,0,swang,,,"From a pure Speech Recognition POV, I will believe Google Goggles is possible when they somehow solved the major problems in Speech Recognition. SR tech has been around forever, but only in the last few years have companies been able to process it on the server side and then zap it over a wireless connection to get somewhat OK processing times.<p>But no one has yet to solve the two problems plaguing SR: First, putting a whole SR engine on a machine let alone on a pair of embedded chips on a piece of eyewear for instant SR. Even with miniaturization and speed/power improvements I just don't see it happening mainly because chip makers have decided to just add more cores. I may be wrong but it seems difficult to parallelize this with a large corpus.<p>Obviously the solution is to go the other way and have super fast guaranteed wireless connection at all times. This will still produce lag but probably acceptable levels for most people.<p>The second problem is one that most people encounter with SR which is when the bloody thing doesn't translate what you said. Either because of an accent or because you're saying something unique or difficult to parse. I tried asking directions to a Mexican place in OC and the results were: Q Cortes, cute protcullis, cute Portos, Q Portales. Can you figure out what I was trying to say? That is the inherent difficulty of the ""last mile"" problems that SR has and I haven't read or heard anything about anyone solving this anytime soon. SR tech will always be just ""good enough"" where they can show it off at a meeting/conference but never good enough to be like Star Trek (which unfortunately has set a incredibly huge bar for people's expectations).<p>Even though the Nokia video is less ambitious they seem to have decided to not include any talking in their future tech videos which seems like a smart idea to me.",1333615729

But there are languages where there are exponential gains in productivity with time. Languages like Lisp, Perk, Haskell etc. But I can't convince that to people who can't look beyond 'readability matters' and consider that as the Pinnacle of programming language design.<p>Coming to regular expressions they are first class citizens in Perl. That is basically what takes them to the next level. Now scripting on Unix has always been so much about Text processing. That is how it has always been. tr, sed, awk and dozen other text processing utilities. And then there is Perl. If you are not getting 'Text processing' thing correct, then you already loose the scripting race with a very huge margin.<p>Perl added a lot of new semantics to the language too given/when statements, smart matching operators etc. Python broke it for as simple a thing as a print statement. That is the whole point(The language is too brittle to evolve). And I'm sure any new thing in Python is going to go the same way.<p>And stdlib is no where near CPAN. Although I agree PyPi is doing a good job.<p>You are right that I must use Perl,And you are also right that Python is an awesome language. There are great frameworks Twisted, Django, NumPy. I've used Twisted extensively. In many Python ways is a great language for web development, for studying algorithms(because its better psuedocode), and due to its frameworks like Twisted - its good for network programming.<p>But I am sorry to say Python doesn't do well in scripting areas. And it so happens once you start there and go a little deeper you can just go on and on with Perl.",1333613848

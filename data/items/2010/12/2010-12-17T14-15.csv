2016369,comment,2016111,2016315,0,0,madmaze,,,"I completely agree with @evilmushroom and strongly disagree with the article. Especially about the ""That allows the company to encourage engineers to waste 20% of their time on ""projects"", like Google Wave.""<p>Maybe I was the one user that really enjoyed using wave, it is a great collaboration tool if you have between 2 and 8 people working on one thing. We wrote entire(60+pages) of design documents in wave. Its also a great note taking tool since for example in class, especially if you have many people working together on the same set of notes.<p>And now to get to the ""20% of wasted time"", this time is NOT wasted. It is an investment in the companies ability to innovate and also in their employees themselves. Without time to spend on other projects, one starves the creative mind, which is bad for the individual and especially bad for the company as a whole.",1292597986

I wonder if this one has something like that...  or even if it'd be a little easier in OWA?  Piwik has made a number of choices that prevents the rollup of logfiles (for now) - I'd be happy to abandon the heatmap and screen resolution metrics for historical data ... just so long as it meant I was able to add my historical data to the system.",1292597982
2016367,comment,2015898,2015898,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Congrats on the new app :)<p>I'll share a few things:<p>I'd suggest revising/rethinking your one sentence pitch that, ""Encode is an online video converter built for people who don't care about conversion details."" The ""conversion details"" would be what exactly? To me, I interpret that to me ""what format the output file is"". If that's the case, then every single user/person is interested in the ""conversion details"". If you meant something else, then I didn't get it.<p>Also, I don't guess that I understand who would use this. When you buy almost any video camera, digital camera with video, or even video phones, almost all of them come with a way to convert/output the video into multiple formats. There are several open source converters as well and even iTunes can do some conversion. Maybe this is what you mean by ""conversion details""?<p>I would also agree with lukeinth that pricing seems ""off"". But... what startup web app ever gets that right anyway!?!<p>Enjoy the journey and congrats again for putting it together",1292597980

2016365,comment,2015681,2016323,0,0,rayboyd,,,"I think lonely people crave companionship more than sex - given the choice. Society has formed in a way where ""beautiful people"" tend to get the breaks, get the sex and generally have a better quality of life. I understand a big part of this is also down to evolution and reproduction, but we have entire industries built on sexual aspiration such as fashion, advertising and porn.<p>I understand people crave sexual gratification, that's human nature, but I think products like this will only serve to compound the problem, make more people who feel this way look inward and ultimately more unfulfilled and lonely.<p>Would research and technology not be better served if it was used to help break these barriers and bring people together - rather than isolate them in their own lonely existences.<p>I am aware a lot of this is my own opnion, I just think it's pretty disgusting that this could be a possible future.",1292597943

When she read it, she was annoyed because the redaction was incredible horrible. But later we realized that the students didn't write it, the ""homework"" was a web page translated with Google Translate.<p>Another time, I need an example of the differences between JPEG and JPEG2K for a internal talk. I found a photograph with a zoom of Lena's eye with a legend like ""JPEG2K 1% vs JPG 1%"", but the webpage was in Japanese, and I can’t reed it. So I use Google Translate to be sure that it was a comparation of the two methods with the same compression level.<p>So Google Translate is very good to get an idea of what some web page means, but it is not good enough to make a final version of the translation.<p>This app have some additional difficulties that GT doesn't need to solve: they need to OCR the text in the wild, they have less computational power and they have to do it in real time. It is almost incredible that they can solve these things. With a word to word translation, I think that you can get a good enough translation 90%, 95% or even 99% of the times, but the corner cases can be really unintelligible. The translation of ""Tongue Bolivian ..."" is fine, and the user can understand what it means, so it is useful.

2016216,comment,2014770,2015982,0,0,dedward,,,"They didn't ""establish nullification"" - nullification is simply the logical outcome that the jury's decision is final, and can't be questioned.<p>The reason judges don't want this fact brought up by counsel during court is because it would render the legal system meaningless... in general I think we'd all LIKE the jury focused on the law and the evidence, not their gut feelings.<p>This always comes up in discussions when we feel the law is unjust and the accused isn't getting a fair trial - but please consider, if counsel were allowed to bring this up in court and instruct the jury that, you know, regardless of what you have heard here, you can vote however you feel like it and, you know, nobody is allowed to give you shit over it afterwards.... that street runs both ways.  You'd have people who DO deserve punishment getting off scott free.",1292594844

It seemed like you were saying that because it wasn't altruistic it should be left off a list of reasons to support them. Amazon doesn't discount for altruistic reasons, they do it to increase sales.  But obviously you consider a discount real value no matter what the intention is.",1292594696

Merely selling a product and advice isn't working alone.  People aren't going to pay for advice when they can get it for free.  Especially when the people providing the advice are also trying to sell you a product.<p>You make a lot of good suggestions.  The best part is, mom-and-pop stores are better situated to make these changes.  The question is whether they will or not.  My wife and I shop both online and offline.  Price alone is not the only factor.  Local M&P stores compete on more than just pure price online.",1292594690

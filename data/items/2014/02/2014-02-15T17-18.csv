7244575,comment,7243718,7243718,1,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Honestly, I think you can rarely make a convincing case based on technical merit or productivity promises alone. There are often good reasons to be conservative about technology choices.<p>I would try it from a different angle. If the organization wants people who are able to come up with fresh ideas, these will not be the same people who are content with using only very mature technologies. If the organization wants to cultivate an innovation mindset and be attractive for innovative people there needs to be space for experimentation. Who knows what comes of it.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s the point where you get fired. If you were hired by an insurance company to maintain their 2002 style J2EE monster that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen.",1392487140

Is a YouTube user naturally a Google Drive user?  A Gmail user naturally a Blogger user?  This seems to only make sense to Google, and not their users.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much overlap there was between YouTube users and Google account users, but Google merged the two simply to boost the profile of Google+.  People who wanted to comment on YouTube videos with their Google+ pals and their real identities were already doing that -- on Google+.  The forcing of Google+ on YouTube offered no discernible benefit to YouTube users that could not have been offered while maintaining YouTube as a distinct social network.<p>As a Google+ user, the utter disregard towards YouTube and its distinct identity severely annoyed me.",1392487128

I do have one thing I&#x27;d like to add a general comment on, even if it doesn&#x27;t pertain to you:<p>> I don&#x27;t force my team to do the same (and they don&#x27;t).<p>For anyone who does work at all hours, before and after the traditional workday, I would just kindly remind you to be cognizant of the messages you send to your team if you&#x27;re firing off emails and sending other work products every other night at 10pm and every morning at 5am. While you don&#x27;t mind doing it for yourself, and externally you tell everyone you don&#x27;t expect the same, it does begin to put informal social pressure on everyone else. This is particularly true if one or more employees start responding/emulating those odd-hour communications, out of drive or a sense of unspoken obligation, which pushes everyone else into a &quot;I do this but you don&#x27;t have to [but really you should <i>wink wink</i>]&quot; situation. Even if people don&#x27;t match behavior, it can lead to stress.<p>In short: be aware of the pressure your behavior can send irrespective of your words, in light of your position of authority.",1392487108

If only 30 hours is sustainable for you, do that instead. But stop imposing onto others what is right or wrong when there are <i>so</i> many factors at play.<p>Some of my most productive memories are summers studying and working for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week (= 72 hours). I didn&#x27;t get tired, burned out, or anything. Another summer had me working at a company making &quot;apps&quot; for 40 hours a week, and it fucking drained me... despite taking <i>far</i> less intelligence and brain effort. I suppose that&#x27;s not true, the brain effort was constantly justifying why I wasn&#x27;t quitting haha.<p>Regarding friends/partners/etc. If the amount of hours you want to work isn&#x27;t compatible with your partner&#x27;s expectations... <i>get a new partner</i>. Seriously. Your priorities aren&#x27;t aligned. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if my partner expected me to be home for dinner at 6pm on weeknights... Oh wait I do, I&#x27;d get a new partner, which I did. Now everyone involved (myself, previous partner, new partner) are very happy.<p>Finally regarding productivity vs. hours put in. Again, this is completely irrelevant if you&#x27;re following the right metrics - <i>results</i>. Long hours obviously don&#x27;t make sense if they&#x27;re making you too tired to deliver results. If you&#x27;re delivering but not in a sustainable way, well, you need to calibrate and lower expectations so you don&#x27;t under deliver.<p>In short, people should optimize for long-term productivity appropriate to their goals. This, combined with your unique physiology and work circumstances, will dictate how many hours you should work. Oh and definitely exercise every week.",1392487009

I have a family and friends, but I&#x27;m very transparent about my work habits and priorities as a full-stack engineer.<p>Being so young, I see myself as training to be the person I want to be in the future. The best programmers in the world worked at it relentlessly. Sure, there are variances in the amount that they all worked, and some did it with much less work than others. But if I want to be the best in the world, or at least attain my personal upper bound, I have to work hard at it and I have to work consistently at it.<p>John Resig didn&#x27;t wake up one day and write jQuery. Steve Wozniak didn&#x27;t just throw together the Apple I. Linus didn&#x27;t just decide to write the Linux kernel one afternoon. They all put to work the investments they made in themselves.<p>I don&#x27;t do it because I want money, success, or fame. I do it because I deeply want to make a meaningful impact on the world. I want it so bad that when I think about it my palms sweat and my chest gets heavy. When you look at the future of humanity as a whole, we need to either improve or die. And to improve, we need improvers. I want to be an improver and I don&#x27;t want to rest until I am.<p>To be clear, I love what I do and I don&#x27;t really consider it work. Solving hard problems with creative techniques is one of my favorite things to do. I really enjoy learning new things, and being able to pull them into my work is really satisfying. Being able to build something that I imagine, push it out to people, and see them get excited about it is surreal. I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to be doing anything else. I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to stop working.<p>But I understand the research. I understand that the work I put in will be more productive and beneficial to me if I have a balance in all areas of my life--which means that I need to be social, have hobbies, and live a healthy lifestyle.<p>So I&#x27;ve aligned my life such that those interactions still help me reach my upper bound. My friends are smarter than I am and many are in technical fields so getting a beer with them involves talking about a hard problem we solved. My hobbies include writing StackOverflow posts, trying out new frameworks, and reading books like Thinking, Fast and Slow, RabbitMQ in Action, and Secrets of the Javascript Ninja. I truly enjoy and am satisfied with these parts of my life, even though I&#x27;m never really leaving the mindset of work.<p>One day I want to write those books, not just read them, and I want those books to meaningfully impact the world. So I train, and that means I&#x27;m an 80 hours a week guy.",1392486641

If instead the JSON is stored in a parsed binary format then you can more efficiently access individual fields.<p>If you&#x27;re only accessing a small set of known fields you can work around the issue by using plv8 to create function indexes on the fields that you&#x27;ll be using. This doesn&#x27;t work for arbitrary expressions though. If you want to filter a WHERE clause based on a non-indexed field the entire JSON text will need to be parsed.<p>Binary JSON storage makes all of this much faster with no change on the user&#x27;s side. It&#x27;s all transparent and just faster!<p>In theory it could also reduce storage space for tuples. Duplicate field names need not be repeated. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in scope in the Postgres JSON improvements but it&#x27;s a possibility.<p>> Why is everyone expecting it to become document storage?<p>Document storage in a relational database is really useful and there are plenty of use cases for it.<p>The standard example I use for JSON (<i>or hstore</i>) usage for Postgres is an audit table. You&#x27;d have all the usual audit fields (<i>who/what/when</i>) but you&#x27;d also have a &quot;detail&quot; field with event specific details. Using hstore or JSON for this is perfect. Improved support for JSON makes it much easier to provide event specific search.",1392486478

Pretty humbling to have someone pay so much attention to what we did!<p>It&#x27;s funny to hear about the Microstile/Eurostile differences - when we had to replace type that was on the real set we made new elements using Eurostile, so there are probably some inconsistencies.<p>The Bank Gothic/gradient fill/outline choice definitely haunted us for a while after - it was already a bit of a scifi poster trope but it&#x27;s got out of control since.  I&#x27;ve cringed a few times seeing posters on the tube and wished we&#x27;d picked something slightly different.  I remember being keen on an outlandish faux-Cyrillic face at the time but it wasn&#x27;t legible enough.  I did win the argument about colour though - my boss at the time did a bunch of concept frames with translucent orange type for the main credit lines... there&#x27;s a little interview with him here: <a href=""http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/moon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/moon/</a><p>Maybe it&#x27;s too obvious to bear mentioning but there&#x27;s a big foreshadowing in the shot where Sam Rockwell&#x27;s credit appears - a second copy of his name dissolves up out of focus further back inside the base...<p>The OCR-1A type was set by me, in a slight hurry as I recall, type-on effect and all.  It had to look different to the Bank Gothic credit lines, and I&#x27;m sure we tried the obvious Eurostile and it wasn&#x27;t readable or was too heavy for that amount of text.  It feels a bit of a case of too many faces in succession, in retrospect.  I love machine-specific typefaces.  I think I first got into them after reading The Computer Contradictionary, which mentions E13B a couple of times, the type used for the numbers printed in magnetic ink on cheques: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognit...</a>.

We definitely tried having the letters formed by the actual dots but they weren&#x27;t legible enough, and making the dots smaller made them not legible enough.  Sense of nerd embarrassment.  I guess it&#x27;s some kind of future display technology with... big dots?  Err...<p>Trivia: the postcard reading &quot;wish you were here&quot; was inserted in post because we had to cover up the real one which couldn&#x27;t have its rights cleared ;)<p>More trivia: there was a spelling mistake on one of the panels on set, the one which says &quot;satellite uplink&quot; when Matt Berry is yelling at Gerty.  It was caught by QC and I have some memory of fixing it for that shot since we&#x27;d inserted the video into that screen anyway, but it might be visible in other shots.

Robots ain&#x27;t cheap and it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s all software license fees either, you need to actually pay people (or robots) to dig ore out of the ground and to use energy to transform it into metal and then form those ingots into usable shapes and then transform those usable shapes into robot frames and then attach electrical or hydraulic actuators and pumps and put controlling circuitry in there and then you still have to have the control system.

Sometimes it is the fault of the worker, but unless that worker is an executive, this is almost always the fault of management. I have occasionally worked more than 40 hours because something was engrossing, but this is unusual as I know when to stop. In almost every single case of working more hours it was because of <i>bad management.</i> Unfortunately, a lot of these management decisions are do or get fired and I have left many a job because of it, usually to my detriment.<p>The other problem is that somehow people want to make an exception for <i>their startup.</i> Their startup is special. Their startup won&#x27;t suffer from these problems. As if their startup has found a way to make humans efficient and healthy without sleep. Please. That kind of thinking (I&#x27;m staring at a comment right now) is exactly what leads to this kind of mess. Where does the 40 hours a week come from? Years of experience by both workers and their managers and executives.<p>Why then are executives nowadays so clueless, especially the ones at startups?",1392485918

But when your main concern is your family, your child&#x27;s education, and putting food on the table, any option is a good option.

Holding back on an area because the wages are &quot;too low&quot; in fact drives wages there even lower, so that other exploitative people will be able to exploit this imbalance.<p>So avoiding cheap labor doesn&#x27;t make sense and causes exploitative wage reduction by artificially withholding demand, and paying more than market price doesn&#x27;t make business sense. For example if I have three photographers. One charges $100/hr, the other $200/hr, and the third $300/hr. If I hire the first photographer I don&#x27;t just decide to pay him $300 simply because the highest quote I received was $300.

I mean, it hasn&#x27;t closed down and run off with everyone&#x27;s funds. That&#x27;s about all you can hope for these days. I also have no problems with BTC-e.com, but I only day trade there. I don&#x27;t connect my personal banking info to it. Instead I use Coinbase.com for that intimacy. YC-backed, also very much enjoyed this video[1] and they&#x27;re San Francisco based which is very close to me so I can stage my own protest if my funds disappear. :)<p>1. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/17/foundation-brian-armstrong-on-coinbase-and-bitcoin-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/17/foundation-brian-armstrong-...</a>",1392483948
7244345,comment,7244109,7244109,1,0,codegeek,,,"There is definitely many sides to this whole argument of &quot;x hour work week&quot;. For many, it makes sense to push their limits and clock up 60+ hours/wk while many are productive working just about 40 or less. And we can certainly discuss the pros and cons of both. But one of the fundamental things that I believe we should all think about is the ability to control what/how/when you do things. This includes work hours as well. As an example, I know many colleagues who take pride in working a lot of hours and they even login from home just to reply to emails. Do they really <i>need</i> to do that ? In most cases, I would challenge that they don&#x27;t. But it is a tendency that develops over time and one day you suddently realize that you are clocking 60+ hours/wk and don&#x27;t even know why.<p>But then you could argue that everyone else on the team does that, my boss likes it that way blah blah. Again, totally understood that if everyone else is doing it, why wouldn&#x27;t you but the fact still remains &quot;you <i>can</i> control it to an extent&quot;. That&#x27;s the point.<p>I have made it a point to set some strict boundaries. Sure, I have the luxury of doing that after being in the industry for a while as a specialist and my clients depend on my expertise. So it is more about value than time. Focus on creating that for your employers/clients and you are golden.",1392483921

7244343,comment,7242788,7243221,3,0,afterburner,,,"Interestingly, the case about firemen not helping someone who didn&#x27;t pay the out-of-county fire coverage fee also relates directly to health care. The reason they didn&#x27;t help is because if someone was hurt fighting a fire they weren&#x27;t supposed to be fighting, their health insurance wouldn&#x27;t have covered it. If there had been universal health care, this would not have been an issue. Many screwed up incentives in the US result from lack of proper health coverage.",1392483896

This is the right way to compare. The major difference is that we&#x27;re not a one-trick pony, we have dozens of services that people want.  For a more comparable example, several mostly-unrelated Microsoft online products (Office365, SkyDrive, Xbox, Skype, Outlook.com, etc.) are all under the umbrella of a Microsoft Account. Which also makes a lot of sense, for example I suppose you can buy a unified cloud storage quota that can be used by both Office365 and SkyDrive, among other things.  OTOH, because I have a MS account, I also have a (send-only at least) Outlook.com account. But I have no problem with that, I just don&#x27;t use it.",1392483895

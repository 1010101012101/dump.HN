The restrained resource usage and no <i>malloc</i> dependency is something that I wish more libraries paid more attention to.<p>However, the stated target audience of the library seems odd. They say that the API is meant to abstract away the cryptographic details, and yet it still requires a crypto expert to go behind the API to set things up... which is fine, but if there <i>is</i> a crypto guy on a team, he could as easily cook up the abstraction interface around whatever crypto library they currently use. Unless I am missing something obvious, this abstraction layer and the whole focus on ""usability"" appears to be more of a hindrance that complicates access to the actually useful parts of the library (the high-speed crypto).",1322949186

Yet countless laptops models throughout the year have shown quite a possibility of variation. Countless touch smartphones from the advent of the iPhone have shown the same for phones too. An Xperia Arc, a Nexus S or a Lumia 800 are very distinct from an iPhone. Even in the tablet space, look at the Xoom, or the Sony S, or the Asus EeePad and EeeSlate, they all are looking significantly different from the iPad. They have an identity of their own. Now you can't honestly tell me that the two tablets shot in the article are not looking strikingly similar (barring for the aspect ratio and the home button position). Even a (theoretically thinned) HP Slate whose exterior design is very close to an iPad has at least rounded corners with a markedly different radius and a slightly wider metal band circling around from full-front, giving it a more robust appearance and a distinct identity.<p>I concur, there are indeed some constraints that impose a number of choices to the design of a tablet, but there is <i>still</i> some variability available.",1322948651

While its an annoyance there are Ways to curb the amount received.<p>Lots of not useful email is sent but there are lots that <i>are</i> useful.<p>The cool thing about email is that you can choose to ignore it easily and come back later. When you substitute IM for email you're opening a can of worms that can be worse. An IM is harder to ignore, people expect an instant response and people will still use it for communicating less than useful info still.<p>When you have an IM client open all the time you're going to have to context switch more often than with email. With email you may get a little alert via something like the Mail.app sound for new mail or a Growl type notification but you know it can wait. With IM you're going to be switching over immediately. Context switching kills productivity and this policy will make matters worse.<p>The better solution would to implement a policy that stops people from sending ridiculously not useful emails. They aren't solving the problem but just putting it into a new context.<p>But then I'm reminded of a story here on HN from a day ago from the Atlantic that talks about how folks like us can easily criticize but if we're so smart why aren't we running that company.

I have essentially beaten it and no longer have chronic pain, am no longer on boatloads of medication, etc.  The condition is very deadly, so the standard medical response is to break out the big guns and nuke the body in order to kill off deadly infections.  Having recovered from the sexual abuse I endured, I pursued the opposite approach of gently supporting my body -- feeding it right, removing problems from my environment and so on.

3308800,comment,3303796,3308607,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"It sounds like you've said not that scarcity exists in the supply, but rather than a limited amount of demand exists.  That much certainly seems true (consider YouTube's statistics on how many days of video get uploaded per minute).  However, I don't see how that leads to the conclusions you suggest; it certainly doesn't have the same effect as scarcity of supply.<p>> The question is, should I as the creator of the information be able to capture all that value? Some of that value? None of that value?<p>You have the right to try; you don't have any fundamental right to succeed, but you can certainly try.<p>I agree with the concept that you create value when you create new information, rather than at some later time.  That seems like the perfect time to attempt to extract value, since you can choose not to create the information if you can't get value for it, and you can choose to focus on creating information for which you can derive value.<p>That model fits nicely with systems like Kickstarter: raise money to create something, then create it.  If those become the primary model for funding creative work, they'll almost certainly attract more interest and more funding, which would otherwise go to copyright-subsidized creativity.  Seems to me like a pretty reasonable model.  Other sensible post-copyright models almost certainly exist; people just haven't thought of them yet, or haven't demonstrated that they can succeed.",1322946099

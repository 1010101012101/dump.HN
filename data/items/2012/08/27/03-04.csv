4437356,comment,4436349,4436349,6,0,mkl,,,"There are lots of attempts to write new Wikipedia parsers that just do ""the useful stuff"", like getting the text.  They all fail, for the simple reason that some of the text comes from MediaWiki templates.<p>E.g.<p><pre><code>  about {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on}} east of\n</code></pre>\nwill turn into<p><pre><code>  about 55 km (34 mi) east of\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>  {{As of|2010|7|5}}\n</code></pre>\nwill turn into<p><pre><code>  As of 5 July 2010\n</code></pre>\nand so on (there are thousands of relevant templates).  It's simply not possible to get the full plain text without processing the templates, and the only system that can correctly and completely parse the templates is MediaWiki itself.<p>Yes it's a huge system entirely written in PHP, but you can make a simple command line parser with it pretty easily (though it took me quite a while to figure out how).  The key points are to put something like<p><pre><code>  $IP = strval(getenv('MW_INSTALL_PATH')) !== ''\n        ? getenv('MW_INSTALL_PATH')\n        : '/usr/share/mediawiki';\n  require_once(""$IP/maintenance/commandLine.inc"");\n</code></pre>\nat the start of it, and then use the Parser class.  You get HTML out, but it's simple and well-formed (to get text, start with the top level p tags).<p>To get it to process templates, get a Wikipedia dump, extract the templates, and use the mwdumper tool to import them into your local MediaWiki database.<p>I don't know if this is the best or ""right"" way to do it, but it's the only way I've found that actually works.",1346039488

4437353,comment,4436139,4436920,4,0,parasubvert,,," You seem to be under the impression that phones once were free & loose, and then Apple locked them down.     Phones never were free - carriers controlled what went on them, and what features were used.   Apple opened devices up to a level never before seen - no more carrier crap pre-loaded, and a serious push to improve data pipes and 3G availability throughout North America.   Not to mention an app marketplace NOT controlled by the carriers, and an web browsing experience that doesn't require you to be snooped on by WAP gateways.<p>Do you not still see the (baseless) grief Apple gets from carriers about how their phones are ""data hogs""?  Or how the media breathlessly claims the retina display is going to clog up all of our bandwidth from higher resolution video and pictures?<p>Phones were always locked down heavily, Apple blew up that up to a large extent, but not completely, of course, as they are in business....  But today's variety of walled gardens are mostly untouchable by the carriers.<p>> Apple's restrictions are all about controlling device owners to make Apple more money. (Otherwise they would be ""suggestions"".)<p>No, the restrictions are all about curating an experience.  Suggestions require choice.  Most people don't want to make choices on how their phones work, they want to be handed experience with most decisions made for them, and for popular variations to be tweakable.   ""Opinionated software"".<p>> You may not install apps that don't pay Apple 30% of their revenues.<p>Well, yes, they are capitalists, shame on them.<p>> You may not install apps that compete with Apple's favored apps.<p>That sucked, I agree, but that's changing.  Chrome is out for iOS.  Alternative Email clients are out.   Apple generally is known for good customer service according to most customer satisfaction surveys, and presuming these people are semi-rational beings, that usually implies Apple actually listens to them (eventually).<p>> I'm saying freedom doesn't what you think it means, and I don't think even Frank Luntz could make it mean that.<p>You seem to be confusing political freedom with freedom to violate others' property.<p>Firstly, you do realize that you have political freedom -- people are completely free to jailbreak their phones, no police will come after you.   If you violate your carrier's T&Cs they can fire you as a customer, but that's due to years of historically poor regulation of telecom in the USA.<p>Secondly, none of the software you use, that you haven't written, is owned by you.    All owners of that software have a restriction on your behaviour with that software, including free or open source software.  You have never been completely free when you use software.    Thus, degree of openness is just a feature.   Apple is trying to find a balance that people care about.  Naturally developers & technical folks don't like losing the freedom to tinker, while most people couldn't care less.  Apple needs to maintain a developer community that tinkers, though.  So it's a balancing act.",1346039395

Especially in case of Apple fans, most of them act like Ayn Rand fans. Though I agree that a whole lot of hard work is done to take things to the finishing line. And Apple is in fact a innovative company and deserves much credit for its success.<p>The whole point is nothing today exists in isolation. The ecosystem around you and other people's innovation play a huge role and are in many ways are responsible for your own innovations. Its a little like social security and taxes. Objectivists may argue that they must get all the pie they earn without giving anything back, because they earned it. But for them to earn it, the society and ecosystem around you- Stuff like roads, national/internal security, education, schools, industries, infrastructure ..<the list is endless>.. was already built for you. The ecosystem was conducive for you to 'earn' your pie. Without all that you would spend much of your life solving those problems first, leaving your actual accomplishments very little. Therefore if each person goes through the same thing, we go no where as a society or as a ecosystem. That is why 'giving back' is so important. Because that creates a feed back loop to achieve more as a society/ecosystem yet offering room for individual growth.<p>For Apple to be so successful. They had to stand on the shoulder of many giants. Even their design philosophy rests on the shoulder of a giant called Dieter Rams.<p>That is why their claims 'to carry the innovation burden of world' are not false but are ridiculous.<p>I agree that they had the what it takes to take risks.

Privacy is the #1 problem; just as computers and the internet make it trivially easy to copy other people's IP (agree with the existence of IP or not, it's a fact of the modern marketplace), it also makes it easy for other people to monitor you, whether those others are governments, corporate proxies for governments, corporate proxies for private interests, or private actors. Hyperbolic anxiety attacks over lockdown? GMAFB - the modern world is a hacker's nirvana compared to the functional rigidity that was the norm during the home computer revolution of the 1980s. Back then, electronic devices were much more expensive than today, so that while non-digital things like VCRs were far easier to explore with a soldering iron, they were also engineered to within an inch of their lives and were not easy to repurpose to other tasks.<p>The whole kerfuffle about 'general-purpose computing' is a foolish distraction. It's like citing the existence of ready-made wood furniture as evidence of a war on general-purpose carpentry. General-purpose computing is easier than ever because it's accessible at a wider range of scales than ever before, from geek-friendly microcontroller kits to distributed clustering architectures. The issue is privacy, and the fact is that the US doesn't have a well-defined legal standard for it, nor any authority dedicated to its preservation.<p>On the up side, while this is going to lead to a good deal of conflict I have hope that most of that is going to take place within markets and via legislatures.",1346038481

(saying ""everyone knows"" is not a good enough answer)<p>Let's take one, specific, example: Blinding. So you think that science added the concept of blinding and double blinded experiments because it <i>didn't</i> result in an improvement in results and a decrease in bias? And a sample size of more than 1? Are you saying there is no evidence that a sample size larger than one leads to better results?<p>What about my statement that having, rather than not having, basic scientific controls in place results in more trustworthy evidence is ""actually not true""<p>> What I do know is that this meticulous record keeping produces bogus results at an alarming rate because of the things it does not consider, like ""publish or perish"" pressure and the ""negative reuslts go in the drawer"" effect. This xkcd describes the mechanism <a href=""http://xkcd.com/882/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/882/</a> , and these extremely well written, peer-reviewed papers, show that most published results (which are golden according to the school of thought you seem to belong to) is actually wrong: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/</a> <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-science-cancer-.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-science-cancer-...</a>. (points to a paywalled nature article). In case you are unable to get a copy of the nature paper: 88% of celebrated cancer results published in the last 10 years CAN NOT BE REPLICATED (that is, are most probably WRONG), despite following the ""golden rules of science"".<p>> Because I actually live in the real world and not in some fantasy world. I don't think removing controls and oversight is a good idea. However, Roberts has no funding for these experiments because there's no way to make money off them. So he does what he finds interesting, in the best way he can, and lets others try to replicate -- and then collects their results as well.<p>Which side are you arguing? So science is <i>hard</i> and there are a ton of shitty results accepted as valid. But you seem to be suggesting that the solution to this is good intentions and a scrappy can-do attitude. If the well funded experiments with large sample sizes, double blinding and excellent controls still screw it up most of the time because of some bias or error in procedure then why would I expect removing all controls would result in something even worth looking at?<p>PS Just to clear something up, in science unreplicated experiements are weak evidence, most are expected to be wrong. replicated experiments are stronger. and theories with multiple lines of evidence from multiple experiments in multiple fields and have emerged as the consensus opinion among experts of how things work are strong. The way you pointed out that unreplicated papers are probably wrong seemed like you thought you had some kind of gotcha. Well the ""golden rules of science"" are pretty clear on the value to be placed on unreplicated papers in a field overrun by media attention.",1346037770

4437250,comment,4432894,4437105,3,0,gizmo686,,,"My original point was that upbringing is important to accomplishments.<p>In response to your point, I think that the problem is much more one of opportunity than drive. For example, I went to a private high school that costs slightly more that the poverty line for a family of 4 (as did my 2 siblings). My mom was able to leave her job, and stay home with me, where she taught me the fun parts of math (knowledge which made school math classes bearable). Later, when I was in high school, my mom started volunteering, where she met the wife of a fairly well known computer science professor at a local university. She arranged with him for me to get a summer internship there, after which point I had a brief phone interview, where I answered almost nothing about my abilities. A few days later, I got an e-mail saying that the robotics lab (where I would have prefered working) couldn't take me, so I had to settle to work in his lab, at 10$/hour - after I offered several times to work for free. While at his lab, I did a reasonable amount of work, but nothing that impressive. One of the things I did was help one of the graduate students with their research project, which involved a web crawler to collect data, and a machine learning algorithm to analyze it. I did some incremental improvents to the crawler, but nothing that impressive. I also wrote the machine learning ""algorithm"" which was a 250 line program that took data from an sql database, and fed it into a machine learning library, then printed out the results. For all of my being driven, I ended up being a co-author on a published research paper before I even applied to colleges.<p>Of course, I am just one person, so we cannot generalize from my example to say that it is the parents that do the work. What we can say is that the children of poor parents are disproportional likely to end up poor. This means that you can, with a high degree of accuracy, predict a childs future success before they are born. If this is the case, they we cannot blame the child for his failures, because we knew that he incredibly likely to fail before he even had a chance to influence his own life. This leads us to the conclusion that there is something going on outside of the control of the poor that is making it difficult for them to improve their lot in life. Looking at it this way, we might notice that the rich tend to spend large sums of money sending children to schools that the poor cannot afford. The rich tend to be more available to their young children, either by leaving their job, or only having 1 job. The rich know other succesfull people, who are an automatic network to get their children jobs and such.<p>In fact, looking back on my own life, and the lives of many of my rich classmates, It seems like we also tend to fall into the same patterns as our parents; those patterns just happen to be successful. This is almost the definition of a rigid class system, and it is something we should be working on moving away from. In an ideal world, even if you knew everything about the parents of two different children, you should have no way of guessing (with better accuracy than a coin toss) which of the children will be more successful.",1346036919

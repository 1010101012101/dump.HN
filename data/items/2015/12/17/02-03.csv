That may be due to a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge by some of the parties, or simply because society (and hence the economy as part of it) is an extremely complex dynamic system that we only understand in broad strokes. That&#x27;s when the good kind of economics happens. (Unfortunately, most economics that you see in public is the bad kind perpetuated by &quot;think tanks&quot;.)",1450321125

10749186,comment,10737234,10744777,0,0,pdex,,,"Personal responsibility has a great deal to do with it, I think the low income is largely incidental. If the parents have learned through generational poverty to reject the importance of education, critical thinking, mental stimulation, learning and creativity then I doubt these parents would have become financially successful or have a brain running on all cylinders.<p>One way to increase brain growth is mental stimulation and learning, and children are very dependent on their parents to provide such. When it comes to genetics, unless you&#x27;re taking about inherited mental disabilities or developmental delays can certainly account for some lack of brain growth. Otherwise it&#x27;s largely environmental.<p>If a family embraces the negative values of generational poverty chooses to imprint their children with the same intellectually repressive values/lifestyle upon their children, then the children would not be exposed to any brain-building activities or stimulation. What do you think the brain development differences would be between a kid who watches TV vs. one that&#x27;s given a 1k piece jigsaw puzzle instead?<p>Luckily there are some parents in low income brackets that heavily invest in their children&#x27;s learning and character development because they want them to have a better life. Some kids find mentors and support outside the home. Poverty doesn&#x27;t doom any child, but it can make learning how to make better choices in life far more difficult if they don&#x27;t have anyone who can teach or motivate them. Difficult, but not impossible.<p>I&#x27;m another child of poverty, grew up in a ghetto. All things were equal with the exception that my family placed a high value on education and they were highly involved and active in my learning.",1450321061

It certainly performs orders of magnitudes better, but it&#x27;s still subject to a lot of the same issues: you have a pool of threads running your http service, and when you exhaust that pool then you have outages. And stopping the world for GC is enormously problematic. Erlang takes care of all that in an extremely elegant way.<p>Also it doesn&#x27;t take minutes (!!!) to compile an Elixir (or Erlang) program.

They must redact personal information of non-involved parties. The capabilities and scope of the monitoring system are to be disclosed publicly. All sounds fine. Where it appears to go a bit off the rails is page 1765-1766 (section A). Here the purpose seems to expand beyond &quot;cybersecurity&quot; and deviate into monitoring non-cyber criminal behavior. Preventing threat of death, terrorist attacks, harm to minors (yes.. think of the children), and... <i>serious economic harm</i> (what exactly is that and to who?).

The paragraph that the GP purportedly objects to:<p>> <i>The “few bad apples” theory of police violence posits that a small portion of the police force is ill-intentioned or inclined to misconduct or violence, while the majority of officers are good cops.</i><p>One of the middle paragraphs that I believe you are referring to:<p>> <i>In addition to the outsize number of complaints, Kalven said, repeaters have broader, cultural impacts, both within and outside of the department. Within the department, repeaters might normalize misconduct toward residents, pushing other cops toward wrongdoing. Outside of the department, the behavior of these officers can turn the community against the police. “That’s what the ‘few bad apples’ theory doesn’t capture: the kind of compounding, metastasizing arms that flow from the impunity of bad cops,” Kalven said.</i><p>If the OP -- and the people that the OP cites -- has the correct interpretation of &quot;bad apples&quot;, then the very point of examining the &quot;bad apples theory&quot; would be to capture the &quot;kind of compounding, metastasizing arms that flow from the impunity of bad cops&quot;...the way that quoted graf is phrased, it&#x27;s as if the &quot;bad apples theory&quot; (and I think &quot;theory&quot; is being used incorrectly here, perhaps) were something different than the idea that bad apples cause the good apples to rot.<p>I skimmed the article twice but didn&#x27;t see any chart, stat, or anecdote that alluded to examination of the impact of an officer on their precinct. That is, when a &quot;bad apple&quot; moves to a new precinct, does that precinct&#x27;s rate of complaints increase <i>in addition to the bad apple&#x27;s expected rate of complaints</i>?<p>The OP is mostly concerned with controlling for factors to argue that bad apples really are bad apples and not because they are in bad environments:<p>> <i>Even after controlling for neighborhood, however, individual officers with more complaints in 2011-13 remained more likely to have complaints filed against them in 2014-15.</i><p>Which of course...is <i>very important</i> to analyze. But it seems straightforward to do a event-time analysis in which, after a major disciplinary incident, or even just a string of minor incidents, in which an officer is apparently unsanctioned, does that impact the rate of misconduct complaints among the <i>other</i> officers in the subsequent months? This could be applied to both bad officers who are being moved around (e.g. Prezbo-style as in &quot;The Wire&quot;) or who, for whatever reason, don&#x27;t get moved around.",1450318960

But the fact of each transaction&#x27;s occurrence will be recorded publicly on Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain, and recorded in a form that allows parties privy to the transaction details to verify cryptographically that the entries in the proprietary  ledger correspond to the sequence of transactions published to Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain. Basically, this scheme uses Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain to provide security (immutability) and public accountability while keeping private information private.<p>(This insert-a-hash scheme is typical of &quot;colored coin&quot; implementations even when privacy is not desired, since each Bitcoin transaction can insert only a small amount of data into the blockchain.)<p>The amended S3 filing [0] spells all of this out in detail.

Concurrently, the tØ software will electronically\n    publish the proprietary ledger and commence the process of\n    embedding in the Bitcoin blockchain information necessary \n    to mathematically prove the validity of available copies \n    of the proprietary ledger. Specifically, after a set of \n    transactions in our digital securities have been executed \n    and recorded to the proprietary ledger, the Pro \n    Securities ATS will send a de minimis amount of Bitcoin \n    from an ATS-controlled Bitcoin wallet to another ATS-\n    controlled Bitcoin wallet using the blockchain protocol. \n    This blockchain protocol provides for an editable field \n    that can be used to implant code or other data within the \n    Bitcoin transaction that will be embedded into the \n    blockchain, and the tØ software will use this field to \n    implant anonymized cryptographic hash functions for the \n    digital securities transactions reflected on the \n    proprietary ledger into the Bitcoin transfer made by the \n    ATS. The blockchain will validate this de minimis Bitcoin \n    transaction and embed it, together with the implanted \n    anonymized cryptographic hash function, into the Bitcoin \n    blockchain. As a result, once the Bitcoin transaction is \n    immutably embedded into the Bitcoin blockchain, an \n    immutable record of the digital securities transactions \n    reflected on the proprietary ledger is also recorded \n    within the Bitcoin blockchain. ...\n</code></pre>\n0. <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1130713/000104746915008523/a2226515zs-3a.htm#dk40601_about_digital_securities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1130713/0001047469150...</a>",1450318058

This is a problem because people will context switch away from driving and there is no way to get them back in the game in 100ms when the car needs help.<p>2) Engine failure is not a big deal, it just means coast to a stop on the side of the road with hazard lights on. Blowouts are a little trickier. But what about unusual stuff like hitting a deer? A wheel falling off? Or another car drifting into the side of our car on the expressway? Those are tricky but not truly rare. This is an area where implementors will need to compete yet purchasers will have a very incomplete view of the relative performance of cars on the market (it&#x27;s not a single number like HP).<p>3) Hitting a pole instead of a person is an easy choice. Yet one that many humans would not be able to make quickly enough. I think autonomous cars will outperform human drivers in &quot;moral&quot; decision making quite early on.",1450317919

Depending on the size of the total array, the relative importance of the different access times vary.  We were actually comparing some different memory layouts besides the standard &quot;sorted&quot; (<a href=""http://cglab.ca/~morin/misc/arraylayout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cglab.ca/~morin/misc/arraylayout/</a>).  Our conclusion was essentially that with proper implementation, there wasn&#x27;t much if any advantage to alternative layouts.<p>But there certainly were some subtle things about testing.  In particular, there is a significant difference between preparing a list of random searches in advance (and loading them from memory), versus calculating a random number on the fly.  Since the performance advantage of the branching approach depended on how far ahead the speculative execution would get, the additional µops for making the number sometimes slowed down enough to remove the speculative advantage.<p>But to clarify my earlier answer:  I think the author is seeing real effect, and the difference has to do with prefetching due to speculative execution of the branching approach.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that branching is the best approach, though, only that a &quot;naive&quot; approach can indeed beat branchless at certain sizes.  Both the branching and branchless approaches can be improved significantly with either batching or explicit prefetching.",1450317823

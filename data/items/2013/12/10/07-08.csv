6879518,comment,6879212,6879384,5,0,dbaupp,,,"FWIW, much of the verbosity in this post is optional, e.g. the very first example could be<p><pre><code>  static mut base: uint = 0x200000;\n  pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn malloc(len: uint) -> *mut u8 {\n      base as *mut u8\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(I&#x27;ll admit the second can be reduced less, since it&#x27;s actually doing real work: basically just dropping the `: uint` on the `let ret`, dropping the `return` and associated `;`, and removing the () on the if condition.)<p>I guess the major source of verbosity is the `extern &quot;C&quot;`, which, fortunately, is only necessary when one <i>requires</i> a function uses the C ABI/calling-convention; in the overwhelmingly common case one writes `pub fn foo(...)` which will use the Rust ABI (and it gets reduced to just `fn foo(...)` if the function can be private to a module).",1386662232

Because the problems we solved looked totally irrelevant to not just me, but every kid in the school. I was glad I opted out of it and did physics experiments instead. It made whole lot sense. Had I continued working on brain dead sorting, and arithmetic problems I would have developed permanent hatred towards programming. I was already learning simultaneous equations, quadratic equations in the Math classes without understanding why and what they even meant. Why learn another such subject?<p>Physics was a place where I saw application of pure mathematics to real life scenarios.<p>Skills that you need to be a good programmer by and large the very same that you need to indulge in any creative activity. Clear definition of the problem, deconstructing it into smaller parts, apply a definite science in assembling smaller solutions, going into a build-feedback-correct cycle etc. You will have to do the same if you do physics, chemistry, biology, math, painting, music, history and may be anything on earth.<p>Programming doesn&#x27;t make much sense unless there is a larger context and scope of your learning in helping solve some meaningful problems gets visible. Other wise the kids will just be doing yet another routine boring math kind of work without knowing its true application.<p>Remember kids building tree houses, That requires nearly the same kind of stuff required to be good programmer, or to take part in a science exhibition. Or a essay writing competition. What is important is to teach kids learn to discover how to work on creative problems.",1386661536

We had many cases where people had tasks of various sorts that they would handle with the equivalent of this screenshot-of-the-data approach. I, a fellow consultant, often groaned when I saw such things and wrote little utilities for them, figured out how to dynamically generate PDFs for their presentation data, or whatever.<p>At one point, the general mgr of our office, said that these things were so valuable to everyone, and I was so good at it and seemed to enjoy it so much, that he was wondering if it wouldn&#x27;t make more sense for him to take me off of my own consulting cases and make IT projects my only case. Of course, IT people were thought of as lowly support staff for the elite consultants, so it would mean a pay cut and end my consulting career. This wasn&#x27;t a warning; he was just thinking that this might better serve the needs of the firm.<p>That day I stopped being a valuable IT resource for my coworkers and reserved my dev skills for my giving myself a &quot;sustainable competitive advantage&quot; in my own work on my own cases.",1386660792

Let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re just talking about HTML/CSS, as Javascript is clearly a programming language.  Many fundamental concepts that you would learn by understanding HTML and CSS are also foundational in programming languages.  You have to understand abstraction, and the use of textual markers to represent those abstractions. HTML attributes are pretty similar to parameters in functions and the tag names would be like function labels.  With just learning markup you discover the power of using text to represent things and how the computer/browser can interpret that data to actually do stuff.<p>Of course there is plenty of things missing, loops and conditionals, state management, functions as data, etc. but 1) if you&#x27;re teaching how to build a web page properly you <i>will</i> be covering javascript and these concepts and 2) even if you don&#x27;t cover Javascript just learning html/css is still a start towards those other concetps.  I&#x27;ve recently started teaching high schoolers how to code and it&#x27;s amazing the sort of fundamental concepts you completely take for granted as a developer that these kids have simply never been exposed to. These are the low hanging fruit that you&#x27;re assuming is not important.<p>Also, embedded systems are becoming increasingly cheaper to develop with, Raspberry Pi&#x27;s and Arduino&#x27;s cost $25 and that space is also becoming more and more open.  There is a long way to go but it&#x27;s certainly happening.<p>Finally, of course computers and internet connections cost money but these are things that people acquire regardless of whether they want to learn how to code or not.  I&#x27;m not naive enough to say everyone has easy access to these things even in affluent countries, but they are goods that are acquired for many more reasons then just learning how to code.  The idea that it&#x27;s free and more accessible comes from that aspect, that the same tools you use everyday to browse Facebook or do a Google search are all you need to become proficient at coding.

More programmers<p>There is going to be subset of people that will discover a new passion for programming through introductory courses. There are a lot of very smart people that never would have thought they could be programmers without the proper serendipitous encounters with the subject.<p>2. Cursory knowledge is useful for your career<p>Even if you decide not to pursue programming as a career, understanding the basics of how computer programs work can help you in many ways in many walks of life. A lot of careers use computer programs on a daily basis, by building some of your own programs perhaps this will help you become more proficient at using other people&#x27;s programs.<p>Additionally, a lot of careers in the future are going to involve pseudo-programming skills such as Excel. Knowing how to program has helped me grasp concepts like pivot tables, excel functions (SUM, AVG, IF, etc.) more easily.<p>Finally, understanding what computer programs are will help you understand high level strategies for what your company can or cannot do to accomplish goals with computers. Knowing what to build is just as important as knowing how to build.<p>3. Cursory knowledge is useful for life<p>Programming is a great way to think about problem solving at large. It teaches a lot of generic techniques that can be applied to all problems in life. Breaking up problems into smaller pieces makes it easier to digest.

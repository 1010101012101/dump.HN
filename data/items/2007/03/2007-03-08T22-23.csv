2998,comment,2987,2996,0,0,notabel,,,"I was pondering this phenomenon earlier today; it would be interesting to do a quantitative analysis of post and moderation rates (this would require access to the backing database).  I have noticed that there tend to be definite hot times, and that posts made outside of those hot times tend to never get modded.",1173394656
2997,comment,2987,2993,0,0,notabel,,,"This, combined with a burying system to get rid of junk stories, could clean up the 'new' section substantially.  It would also be useful to factor snr into the computation; the nature of the karma system, which makes it more advantageous (at a marginal level) to submit a story than a comment, encourages a shot-gun approach to submission; SNR would combat that.<p>EDIT: Ha, points to jwecker for posting about SNR while I was writing about it.",1173394501
2996,comment,2987,2987,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Has anyone noticed that submissions tend to receive more points around 4 to 10 am GMT, Eastern Time? Posts that I make after 9 pm usually remain at ""1 point"" throughout the day. This probably has something to do with the Silicon Valley's working hours.",1173394440
2995,comment,2987,2993,0,0,jwecker,,,"Well, there's also signal-to-noise ratios.  There are some people who have high karma by submitting dozens and dozens of sites knowing that one or two has got to stick.  To me that degrades the quality of the site as much as spam does.  I guess your solution might solve that in a round-about way as well.",1173394387
2994,comment,2987,2987,0,0,jwecker,,,"The word karma in the context of this site has two meanings to me- one is that if you give a little of yourself and write a thoughtful comment or needed submission then you'll be rewarded.  The other meaning to me is this- give a lot of it out and it'll come back to you.  So if you care about karma, be liberal with it.  (and I'm not talking about moderating this comment up).<p>If there is a constant flow of karma, it's much easier to see a differentiation in comments.  There's nothing more irritating to me than seeing a comments board full of great thoughts and lots of responses where everything is either 1 or 2 points.<p>[upd] - and, of course, the old slashdot rule- focus on modding up- have a very good reason to mod down.  Sure wish the digg community had followed that rule (back when I still used it).",1173394259
2993,comment,2987,2989,0,0,python_kiss,,,"There is a similar ""karma"" system on my social network, and one of my users suggested that we limit the amount of karma a user can receive within a give day. On YC, it makes sense to limit the submission volume according to the person's karma level. Someone with high karma is unlikely to be spamming the site.",1173394257

2991,comment,2987,2987,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Well I think we're at the former right now.  Probably need a few more comments per post, but that will happen I think.<p>What we want to avoid at all costs is what happened at Reddit yesterday with the impeachment business.  That's no good.  I know they're working on it (spoke to them last night) but it was annoying there for a while.

2990,comment,2987,2987,0,0,jwecker,,,"I automatically click on a submitter's name if I don't recognize it.  If that submitter has only 1 karma point and is obviously new to the site, that submission gets extra special scrutiny- meaning if it is even remotely promotional I assume it's spam.<p>If you want to jump into the community here, esp. if you've already been lurking for a while- don't do it by doing a submission (unless it's a killer submission)- add some nice comments please!",1173393735
2989,comment,2987,2987,0,0,jwecker,,,"Moderate submission volume + high volume of intelligent comments = very nice site to come and visit for a while.<p>High submission volume + no comments or hundreds of one-liners = might as well set up a news aggregator.",1173393564
2988,comment,2985,2985,0,0,juwo,,,"I plan to follow everyone's advice posted in the YC comments and to release it at Cnet.com
(see http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=1945)<p>Any experiences and opinions good/bad?<p>1) On my software, distributed via Java Web Start, I plan to add a ""Donate"" button that clicks to a paypal page. Anyone have any experience with that? <p>(is paypal the best option? this seems to be a horror story site http://www.aboutpaypal.org/)<p>2) Is it necessary to have a ""dont sue me""/I Agree button?
Any recommendation?<p>LOL, I have never done this before.
thanks,
Anil

Consequently, AskJeeves always felt like the ""natural starting point"".<p>Similarly, Michael Arrington builds trust by often mentioning Om Malik (GigaOm) and Richard MacManus (Read/WriteWeb) on his blog. I suppose it leaves the feeling that ""He can't possibly promote a rivals blog without having a better one himself!""<p>Ironically, a few weeks ago, Scoble mentioned that bloggers are geedy when it comes to linking (he mentioned Engadget/Gizmodo as an example, and that sure did piss them off). I think I will go ahead and forward this study to him :)<p>That said, I would be interested to know how they conducted this study. From the looks of it, it seems they simply compared a site's worth versus # of outgoing links. The fact that we agree with the study might just be a placebo affect.",1173393334

2984,comment,2929,2929,0,0,jwecker,,,"There are danielha's and python_kiss's popping up all over- the ""new"" section is drowning!  ;)  [totally kidding btw- these two have killer submissions]<p>Seriously, though, there should be some kind of reward for wading through all the noise in the new section.  (yah I know I'm as much to blame as the next person.  I do try.)  And you know, maybe it really is time to be able to ""bury"" posts- three votes you're out or something.<p>upd:  just did a quick calculation- 4.5 submissions per hour and speeding up rapidly.  Could just be that time of day though.",1173392559

2982,comment,2805,2851,0,0,zach,,,"I respectfully disagree.  I went to the Boston event and had to put in a lot of work to network with people, since there were no official events or time within the program set aside to meet and talk.  Admittedly, my schedule didn't allow me to do a post-school dinner.  I'm not shy about chatting people up, so I did made use of the time I had and met some cool people.  But I wouldn't recommend it as a networking opportunity.  For one thing, nobody knew each other!<p>But it was great being there in person for the in-person experience, which was gratifying and good positive reinforcement.  That said, I didn't apply this time because I'm really really busy on a feature launch for my startup and it didn't seem like I'd get that much out of it as far as the networking aspect.",1173392138

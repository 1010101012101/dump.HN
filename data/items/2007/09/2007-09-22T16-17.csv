Then I removed the application.  Granted, some people will definitely get a kick out of sending and receiving this, but its replay value is close to zero.<p>It's weird how TechCrunch has some occasionally interesting insights but usually manages to revert quickly to ridiculous pronouncements like this.  This ""app"" is certainly one of the coolest ads I've seen in a little while.  I'm definitely more likely to buy the next Dylan album I see.  <p>But it is far from being a real application, let alone the coolest one ever.  The coolest app on Facebook four months after the platform launch is a one-trick pony pushing a Bob Dylan album?  That says a hell of a lot about f8, but it says even more about TechCrunch.<p>The tech print media has earned a trend-monkey reputation, but tech bloggers make them look like the Encyclopedia Britannica.",1190479426

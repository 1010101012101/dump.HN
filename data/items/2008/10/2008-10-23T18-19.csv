341539,comment,341043,341269,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If mobile devices are the same as MP3 players in the minds of consumers, then that's a great argument.  I don't think they are, though.  I think mobile devices are going to be a replay of PC history: Specific applications will drive adoption of specific products.  The iPhone and the G1 are both vastly more powerful than the first six personal computers I owned, and have better network bandwidth than several subsequent PCs.  I think they will continue to get more interesting, and the application selection will become more important.  If Apple continues to treat developers as competitors to be occasionally shut out if they get too uppity or too close to competing with Apple in some space, they won't keep those developers.  Without the developers, the apps won't exist...without the apps, users will choose an alternative.<p>Others have mentioned that iPhone was ""first"" in this particular market (the market for ""Buck Rogers magical computing devices that fit in your pocket""), and that has definite value (the PC was on the market for a couple of years before Macintosh), but I don't think it can beat openness in the long run.",1224788381

I used to laugh at articles telling you to spell check your application and give other, seemingly extremely basic advice, but I swear about 80-90% of applications have glaring spelling, grammar and semantic mistakes and no discernible logical structure. Come on, how hard is it to assemble a chronological list of things you've done?",1224785173

It would have been straightforward enough to seize the oilfields, staff them with Western engineers, patrol just the pipelines and leave the rest of the country completely alone. That scenario is a perfectly plausible one. So the age of economic war is not over per se, it just doesn't happen to be en vogue <i>right now</i>.",1224784987

This is what is happening in many other developed nations where the increase in population is attributable entirely to immigration.<p>Yes, there are strong cultural reason for those laws, but one would think that at some point the economic consequences would force a change.",1210229987

184274,comment,184120,184120,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"Programming would be easier if the language were uniquely suited to solving the problem (e.g. more built in solutions). In general, it is harder than it seems it should be because to create a language that is actually useful to a wide variety of applications, it needs to operate at a sufficiently low level so that you have the greatest equilibrium between ease of writing and function.<p>Can it be made easier? As a pmb said, not if the problems we are trying to solve are becoming more and more complex. But that's ok since only a limited number of people are actually interested enough (and dare I say capable) of programming. That might be a good thing though since the result is higher quality code/solutions.",1210229779

You can't really write unit tests separate from the implementation. The implementation and unit tests feed off each other.<p>""is there any way that outsourcing can be made to work, consistently?""<p>Here is what has worked, in my experience.<p>(1) Have a <i>fixed bid</i> AND milestone driven (where ""milestone"" is used loosely to indicate a ""chunk"" of business value and takes between a week to a month to code) project. Pay per milestone. At best you lose a couple of weeks worth of money.<p>(2) Hire a <i>good</i>  developer in India/China/wherever.   Work with him on the project with loose milestones. Talk for at least 20 minutes <i>everyday</i> (skype, etc). Once you gell, ask him to reccomend another, equally good developer. Build the team slowly.",1210229394

And people who <i>could</i> do that, but <i>don't</i>, are guilty of living badly, living below their abilities.<p>This is not just a matter of opinion or taste. For example, we are only able to communicate here because of scientific achievement; that is objectively more important than pokemon. And, for example, no one is perfect, so people who correct more of their mistakes end up better than those who don't. People who think and learn more are more able and effective at correcting their mistakes to improve themselves.",1210228299
184265,comment,184088,184224,0,0,trekker7,,,"I upmodded you because I think you raise a valid argument. But I do disagree, because I don't think it's immoral for a highly skilled doctor to quit his profession and open up a comic book store to sell Pokemon cards instead. Yes, society will be worse off for it. But does society have a right to tell the former doctor what profession he should take up? Morals would dictate that people have a basic right to do what they enjoy, as long as they aren't hurting anyone by their actions.<p>But is it a waste of talent for a good doctor to quit his job and pursue a less philanthropic effort? Yeah, that's probably valid.",1210228243

One, you would have a difficult time in finding out the right set of people (skill wise). Two, establishing a good working relationship takes a bit of time, especially working across geographies. A small startup pushing towards it's first beta is probably not the right time to start using the outsourcing model.  \n(Side-note: I am a developer based out of India)<p>You have got a lot of good suggestions on the way forward from here. I would also endorse you seeking out the Django experts on this forum who have offered help. At the bare minimum, they can review the code and tell you where exactly you are and how much more effort it would take to make a beta release.<p>Alongside, you can get some legal advice on getting out of this partnership with the least possible damage to you and your ethics.<p>Learning to code obviously would be helpful, and it really ain't that difficult.<p>Don't worry about this temporary setback, just get back up and give it a shot again. Being in the medical field, am sure you would have seen people fighting and coming out strong from far more difficult situations.<p>Good Luck.",1210228214

184261,comment,184088,184088,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"I have never made a comment on HC and I have been the silent observer for quite a while.  Whether it will be of quality or not, I feel now is a good time to make the first one.  To me, the greatest part of this site is the Ask YC section.  Some of the most insightful and helpful advice I have ever read has come from the comments and in most cases, the comments are significantly better than the articles themselves.<p>The best advice that I ever received was from my father.  He is one of the hardest working men I have ever met (construction) and never seems to complain no matter how tough things or life can get.  This bit of advice may have been given to him at one point, but not too long ago he said to me, ""Don't ever feel like you are missing out on something. There will always be another party"".<p>While this advice is somewhat simplistic on the surface, it really has given me the ability to put life and the choices I make into perspective.  It is easy to put your future on the back burner and get caught up in the feeling that it's a necessity to go out all the time (I am in college if that put things into  perspective).  I am gifted with the uncanny  ability to rationalize to myself that the poor decision I am about to make is the somehow the appropriate one at the time(/sarcasm).  Opportunities sometimes only come once in a lifetime and how we handle those situations is often the true determinant of our character.<p>Sometimes it is hard to stay in and direct my time and efforts into my current side project.  Hopefully there will be many parties (celebratory I would like to think ;) ) to make up for the time that I am spending to make an impact and reach success outside of the norm.  Sometimes I laugh at some of the comments people around me make, believing as though they can spend 6 out of 7 days a week drunk and then magically be granted a seven figure salary as the CEO of some organization right out of college.  The other day someone I am unfortunate enough to know said to the people in a class ""In ten years, you will all be working for me!"".  Well, I sure hope that in ten years I am not the katsup man in the McDonald's assembly line.<p>I am actually excited to submit an Ask YC question of my own in the next day or so because I really feel like I could use some direction on after college decisions.

It took some really annoying stuff happening for me to get completely out of film stuff (and music stuff too - I used to be really involved in local music)...  and it was incredibly liberating.<p>One of the big things that got me going in my current direction was the book The Art of Innovation.  That may only be inspiration for people into product design, UI, etc. (like me) and not necessarily for CS nerds...  just a suggestion.",1210227380
184259,comment,184088,184224,0,0,mlinsey,,,"No, I wouldn't call that immoral at all.  Immoral, to me at least, is when you cause harm to other people.<p>There's absolutely nothing wrong with deciding you don't want to devote enormous amounts of time and effort to something creative.  For example, you can touch plenty of people's lives and have a tremendous positive impact on the world just by being there for your friends and family, something that devoting yourself to an intensely creative endeavor probably interferes with.<p>Don't get me wrong - entrepreneurs, authors, and other creative people are special people.  That's why they are rewarded (sometimes) with praise, admiration, or money. But that most emphatically does <i>not</i> mean that they are better or more moral people than those who choose to live more ordinary lives.",1210227289

Summoned to the CEO's office, I figured I'd soon be stuffing my knickknacks in a box.<p>Instead he told me the following story about Sam Walton, the founder of a somewhat successful retail venture.<p>A newly hired executive had made a multi-million dollar mistake and he too was summoned to the corner office. Before Sam could get a word in, the executive said ""Save the lecture and just fire me.""<p>Sam studied the young executive for a few moments and replied ""Fire you? I just invested millions of dollars in your education - you don't even get to resign"".<p>Like Sam Walton's freshly minted executive, I learned an important lesson that day. Mistakes, even those of the multi-million dollar variety, are inevitable. What is of utmost importance is that we learn the lessons taught.<p>(Only later did I fully grasp that small mistakes are actually desirable).",1210226661

The mantras of &quot;Get Sh*t Done&quot;, &quot;Great Artists Ship&quot;, &quot;Always Be Coding&quot;, &quot;Hack your life&quot;, &quot;If you&#x27;re not coding your competition is&quot; and many other lousy, empty and ultimately meaningless statements just serve to make anyone who&#x27;s not constantly coding feel like something is wrong with them.<p>Chances are you&#x27;re like most people and have a wide variety of interests and hobbies, and so trying to keep up the pretense that you just care about your startup or current project can be emotionally exhausting. It&#x27;s basically lying to yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a concrete answer for you in how to break this funk. Funks can happen. The advice all people here have given you is spot on, I will just add that all that advice should be tried and discarded if not useful, it&#x27;s what worked for them, might not work for you. I personally also suggest include avoiding online content and getting outside. I also suggest you figure out some way to learn to make peace with tedious work, it happens in almost all client work.<p>Good luck friend!",1389920394

Modern liberals do not believe progressivism, they believe extremism, revolutionarism. They want to destroy bad tradition as soon as possible. They just cannot wait. They hate people who are different from them (read: stupid).<p>BTW. I am a science person. I think creationism is trash, but I am OK with other people to believe creationism or whatever. I know there are billions year ahead of human evolution and cultural evolution. I don&#x27;t expect to see all these changes in one night. I don&#x27;t believe use government to impose cultural change to its citizens is a right thing to do!<p>As for the &quot;public&quot; school thing. That&#x27;s simply because people do not have a choice. The dominance of public school in pre-college education destroyed the education market and made private schools hard to exist. That&#x27;s why many religious people want to change the so called &quot;public&quot; schools, which is the only place they can send their children to. I do not blame them. This is just a minor collateral damage of the centralized education system. There are many much worth things in public education.<p>Public money? Come on, that&#x27;s also their money.

Give yourself a one week vacation, and go do something fulfilling that doesn&#x27;t involve working on this app.<p>What do you like to do? It doesn&#x27;t have to cost money, per se. Go visit some friends for a week, or go on a hike, or just go do something around town you&#x27;ve been wanting to do but haven&#x27;t. However, try to have it involve other people, and not just be by yourself.<p>Right now, you&#x27;re working&quot; every day, but getting nothing done. There is probably a lot of fear that your app won&#x27;t work, that no one will use it, that you are wasting your time and will have nothing to show for it at the end. Of course, there is the possibility that I am just projecting on you, as I have had all of these feelings and displayed some of the same behaviors, but I guess that is for you to decide.<p>The purpose of the break is to get some perspective.

The self doubt and fear of failure is what keeps you going to the office every day, but getting nothing done.<p>By taking a break and clearing your mind, you can reassess where you&#x27;re at with fresh eyes, tackle the big problems keeping you from moving forward, and create a solid plan of action to move forward.<p>That&#x27;s just my two cents, having had similar issues...",1389920262

7073599,comment,7073373,7073373,5,0,caseydurfee,,,"Continuous glucose monitors have been around for a while.  I&#x27;m not sure who this would help.<p>The fundamental problem is that glucose levels in non-blood fluids do not exactly match blood glucose.  The current monitor solutions use interstitial fluid in the skin.  They still require the user to test themselves several times a day and recalibrate the monitor based on blood glucose, and they can&#x27;t alert the user if their blood sugar is low until it&#x27;s already a serious situation.  They also frequently give false positives.<p>This is a new (but very clever!) way to do something that has been around for a while, not a revolution, unless tears track blood glucose much closer than interstitial fluid does.  Simply based on first principles, that seems unlikely.<p>And there are basic hygiene problems wearing contacts while you&#x27;re asleep, which is when monitoring would be most useful.  If google has the technology to make contact lenses that you can wear 24*7 without getting ulcerative keratitis, that&#x27;s more revolutionary than another way to monitor blood sugar.",1389920213

To understand price changes it&#x27;s important to consider how they change.<p>Price movements occur as a result of a buyer or seller aggressing into a market and submitting an order such that the parameters of the aggressor&#x27;s order match the opposite sides unfilled orders. This process is typically referred to as order matching. If a buyer aggresses into the market and matches against unfilled sell orders the price increases because they have removed the lowest prices from the order book. If a seller does something similar the price will drop because the highest prices have been removed.<p>Another reason price movements occur is because people are also reacting to the market and trying to predict where the market is going. As a consequence they will either enter the market at an off market price attempting to predict it, or cancel their outstanding orders and re-price them. But this is another topic entirely and I will leave it out as it&#x27;s pretty complex and my understanding of that topic is newb level at best.<p>The second thing to consider is the why. Why do price movements occur? Mainly because people are consuming information and trying to predict where the market is going. For other assets such as FX & commodities there are non-speculative market participants who buy and sell based on their business need. An example from Foreign Exchange is a company such as Google having a stockpile of dollars and needing to pay employees in euros. The end result of these non-speculative market participants is greater price stability because they are always buying or always selling, not because they want to, but because they have to. But since bitcoin is largely a speculative currency (the majority of bitcoin trading volume is the result of speculation, not legitimate commerce) the news has a disproportionate effect on it&#x27;s prices.<p>My 2 cents say that this will temporarily depress prices but they will quickly recover because someone such as myself recognizes that those bitcoins haven&#x27;t entered the market, so nothing has really changed.",1389919068

The Bitcoin market is neither liquid or large enough to absorb 30k new coins and remain stable.  That means the US government isn&#x27;t going to get $850 per coin.  The effects on the market will likely depend on how the coins are sold.<p><i>Scenario 1:</i><p>There is a single large buyer.  Assuming the buyer and US goverment are smart, they will recognize the liquidity risk of Bitcoin.  The buyer will then get a discount for this and be able to purchase the coins at a below market rate.  Assuming their plan is to hold onto the coins for the long term (or at least not short term), I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large movement in the general Bitcoin markets.<p><i>Scenario 2:</i><p>There are many small buyers.  Each sale would slightly effect the price of Bitcoin as each sale would slowly satisfy demand.  The US government might receive $850 per coin for the first sale, but certainly wouldn&#x27;t for the last sale.  This would cause the biggest harm to the market as the price would drop more than in scenario 1.<p><i>TL;DR</i> - The US government either needs to accept a lower price for the sake of liquidity or accept that their sales will quickly lower the market rate for Bitcoin.",1389918425

In contrast, criminal forfeiture is usually carried out in a sentence following a conviction and is a punitive act against the offender.<p>The United States Marshals Service is responsible for managing and disposing of properties seized and forfeited by Department of Justice agencies. It currently manages around $2.4 billion worth of property. The United States Treasury Department is responsible for managing and disposing of properties seized by Treasury agencies.

7073396,comment,7069321,7071146,6,0,MichaelGG,,,"In my own tests, F# will require about 1/20th of the type annotations of C#. It offers a near superset of functionality, so you don&#x27;t lose anything (except a bit on the tooling side of things).<p>The lightweight syntax, easy handling of functional features, nesting of code - it ends up leaving you with far less code that has less bugs by default. MS describes F# as excelling at &quot;programming in the small&quot; - the line-by-line, char-by-char code is simply far superior to using C#. Just type inference alone is huge - C# is embarrassingly bad at type inference, and it&#x27;s partially due to the complexity in their codebase in implementing it properly. At the moment, MS seems to have sort of backed off on enhancing C#.<p>There&#x27;s so many tiny things in F# that just make the code easier and less bug prone. For instance, being able to nest code. Suppose I want to read an integer out of a querystring, and on failure provide a default. Idiomatically, in C#:<p><pre><code>  int age;\n  if (!int.TryParse(qs[&quot;age&quot;], out age)) age = -1;\n</code></pre>\nIn F#:<p><pre><code>  let age = try int qs.[&quot;age&quot;] with _ -> -1\n</code></pre>\nOr lets say I have some intermediate variables. In C#:<p><pre><code>  int age;\n  var parts = String.Split(bla, &quot;,&quot;);\n  if (parts.Length == 0) age = -1;\n  else age = int.Parse(parts[0]);\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve introduced a useless local var, parts, for no reason other than needing it in computing age. In F# (and avoiding pattern matching just to demonstrate):<p><pre><code>  let age = \n    let parts = String.Split(bla, &quot;,&quot;)\n    if parts.Length = 0 then -1 else int parts.[0]\n</code></pre>\nThe intermediate binding, is not available outside it&#x27;s scope. That&#x27;s far cleaner, and quite commonly useful.<p>Top level functions are handy. Being able to make useful lambdas without specifying the types is super useful. Many of my functions have a nested helper function which makes things cleaner. Places where I don&#x27;t want to add a full utility function, but I don&#x27;t want to repeat code. You can do it in C#, but it&#x27;s ugly. In F# it&#x27;s natural.<p>Array/list comprehensions. In C#:<p><pre><code>  var res = new List<int>();\n  using(var reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()) {\n    while(reader.Read()){\n      res.Add(reader.GetInt32(0));\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn F#:<p><pre><code>  use reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()\n  let res = [ while reader.Read() do yield reader.GetInt32(0) ]\n</code></pre>\nPattern matching is well covered, and F# Active Patterns are just awesome, because you can customize your own destructuring for arbitrary objects. The list just goes on and on, lots of things in F# that are just so right, so easy, so trivial. Custom operators, tuple handling.<p>I&#x27;m not even touching on the larger things, like Type Providers, records, sum types, or the fact that F# has monad syntax that&#x27;s flexible, instead of C# building specific monads into the language. Heck, the F# compiler is far more advanced and produces faster code in many cases. And the fact that you can manually make it inline code is also a nice perf win you simply cannot get with C#.<p>I recently started working on a project that uses C#, and it&#x27;s just such a pain. Death by a thousand cuts. There&#x27;s no reason to use C# over F#. Even if you only use F# as a light-syntax-C#, you&#x27;re better off.<p>The only real objection is hiring, in an enterprise scenario. For any serious project where the code is the product (versus the code being an artifact of just solving a business problem), I don&#x27;t believe you can hire any good programmer that cannot deal with F#. (I think that hold for most languages, in general.) Unfortunately, people don&#x27;t seem to believe that, and somehow think they&#x27;re going to hire really smart people, but these people aren&#x27;t going to be able to learn a different language.",1389917511

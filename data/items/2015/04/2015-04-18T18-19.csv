9400596,comment,9399922,9399922,0,0,newman8r,,,"money is an amazing and fun thing to have but the pursuit of it alone is empty. It&#x27;s so easy to just nod your head at the above statement and agree, deep down believing it&#x27;s true but that your pursuit is somehow more justified. Don&#x27;t ever embark on a project because it&#x27;s &quot;part of an x billion dollar industry&quot;, don&#x27;t ever tell yourself you&#x27;ll do more of x or y once you &quot;save up and get a bit more padding&quot;. Don&#x27;t rip off someone else&#x27;s idea because you will never truly understand it the way they do. Don&#x27;t let a project define your life, you have to be bigger than the project and know that if it fails you will be just fine. Don&#x27;t ever be the &#x27;idea guy&#x27; or &#x27;the money guy&#x27; - if you don&#x27;t fully understand a project and the industry it&#x27;s in, you&#x27;re going to get fleeced. If you&#x27;re really good at X, why would you spend all of your time doing  Y? Because Y is a 50 billion dollar industry? lol. This applies to the stock market too - if you&#x27;re good at code and not so good with securities (impulsive?) - why would you spend so much time researching how to thrive int he stock market? Is it because you truly love the idea of the stock exchange and owning a part of a company as a long term investment - or are you trying to make quick and easy money? What would you think if an expert stock broker came to you with his idea for making an amazing iPhone app, that he&#x27;s putting trading on hold until his app is finished? You&#x27;d maybe tell that guy to slow down for a minute.<p>Write your ideas down - every single one - because eventually you&#x27;ll have many per day and although you will only ever develop a very small percent, those ideas build on each other and become something amazing. Be an expert in one field, but be proficient in many many more- the truly amazing ideas come from connections make across multiple disciplines that haven&#x27;t been seen before because historically people are told to excel in just one area. Those truly amazing ideas, good chance you won&#x27;t develop most of them either but you will delight yourself with the ability to be creative at a moments notice and it will give you the confidence that you can accomplish very big things, and it will be backed up.<p>Know when a project has lost steam and know when to drop it, when to tell the team members it&#x27;s time to work or quit. Don&#x27;t be afraid to trash a project even if it has some potential. If you have a crappy codebase on a non-trivial project - if it was created by 1 or 2 people it&#x27;s probably a lot faster in the long run to just rewrite the thing very clean. Team is important - only work with people who really impress you - if you think you&#x27;re better than everyone else on the team in every area - you have selected/joined a really bad team. Know how to spot other people who give a crap and want to develop cool things. Learn from other experts who know something you don&#x27;t. Never be afraid to admit you were wrong or misspoke. don&#x27;t act like you know it all - the feeling that you &#x27;know a lot&#x27; after studying something for a few weeks must be some kind of common thing, but after another few months you start to realize how very little you know. Don&#x27;t be satisfied with a cursory knowledge of a programming language if you have decided to use it in a project.<p>Don&#x27;t ignore best practices, they help you progress a lot faster and become mentally organized. Don&#x27;t overcomment code - also don&#x27;t obsessively refactor to the point the code is unreadable. Make sure you&#x27;re always learning something new.<p>Find out your favorite way to learn: reading, classes, videos, hacking. These are great but after you know the intro stuff, start to read the official documentation.<p>You know how you say &quot;I can&#x27;t believe how ignorant I was just 2 years ago&quot;?- well in 2 years you&#x27;ll be saying the same thing hopefully - that means you&#x27;re ignorant now and you just don&#x27;t realize it. Be humble, keep up the pace, keep learning - don&#x27;t be lazy you ignorant fucker!<p>If you&#x27;re stuck on a coding problem and have been sitting more than a few hours frustrated- get some help and talk to someone (and stretch). Those ruts that can last 10, 20 hours - they are not good, they are incredibly wasteful and they hurt. Speaking of sitting - get a damn aeron (or whatever your favorite chair is) - even if you&#x27;re poor it&#x27;s worth it. Don&#x27;t be afraid to spend on really good equipment, it all pays off. Always be open to paying more for quality, but avoid paying more simply because of brand. Avoid getting the &#x27;base version&#x27; of a product without carefully considering all of the &#x27;add ons&#x27; and determine if they are actually valuable to you (again on the aeron, the only people who I have really heard say they&#x27;ve very unhappy with it seem to have the cheaper, not-so-adjustable version -it&#x27;s like paying 20% more to get 50% more.<p>If you ever think you will get into creating electronics, don&#x27;t throw away old things with PCBs - at the least pull those things out.<p>Autodidacticism is a wonderful thing as is contextual knowledge - do your best to eventually back up those things you learned with some formal book study. Also - peer programming is an amazing thing, do it at every chance you get. Try your best to find answers to your own questions. Learn more about yourself, try to figure out what makes you motivated, happy, tired, overemotional. When you&#x27;re stressed and emotional your ability to think logically and be effective is drastically reduced.<p>Enjoy the things you like, food, music, books, fashion - based on what makes you happy - try never to buy anything with the thought in your head of how you&#x27;re going to feel when other people see you - it&#x27;s an insidious thought that I assume we all get but if you recognize it you can squash it. Don&#x27;t be afraid to listen to a genre of music because it&#x27;s been stereotyped - if you like corny music then forget it - listen to the corny music and if anyone laughs at you, you can smile and not care a single bit. If you act with indifference to peoples insults or ad hoc arguments they&#x27;ll become insanely frustrated - don&#x27;t continue a debate on ad nauseum. If someone always says you need to have the last word - that&#x27;s a pretty good time to stop taking because not only has the argument become pointless... but yea.<p>ok that&#x27;s a lot - a nice reflection for sure.",1429383270
9400595,comment,9398836,9399814,0,0,pakitan,,,"> Why wouldn&#x27;t it be a huge mycelium?<p>Why hadn&#x27;t it? I mean, not only doesn&#x27;t it posses a drop of intelligence, there isn&#x27;t even something similar that does. And that&#x27;s after billions of years. My guess is something like this - intelligence is the most powerful evolutionary weapon and due to the way evolution works, you only get that weapon if you have to survive among powerful adversaries. However, intelligence is of no use if the species can&#x27;t react fast enough according to changing circumstances. Something with mycelium&#x27;s structure can&#x27;t run, can&#x27;t hide and can&#x27;t attack fast enough. If it somehow evolves to the point it could, it would start resembling existing intelligent species.<p>> More so it&#x27;s entirely unclear why the life should have to be intelligent - or intelligent in a individual-animate-tool-building-animal kind of way.<p>All life doesn&#x27;t have to be intelligent and it&#x27;s not, even here on Earth. It&#x27;s just that here we are discussing intelligent life that can build stuff.<p>> I&#x27;m very unconvinced that even Human civilization or life (should it survive for another 10,000 let alone 100,000 or a million) years will resemble anything like the organic individuals<p>Come on, we&#x27;ve had millions of years of evolution and we&#x27;re still monkeys with less hair. Unless we start meddling with our DNA and/or actually develop artificial intelligence, we won&#x27;t be changing much.",1429383264

Supporting your competitor&#x27;s apps can prevent some immediate suffering by users, but it isn&#x27;t a good strategy for an ecosystem.<p>If people end up mostly running the emulated apps on your OS, you might as well just use that other OS, and run those apps on it natively, for the best experience.

But machine learning is nothing more than codified human judgement (yes, I get that for example the conditional expectation minimizes the expected squared error, but who picked the expected squared error to minimize?)  The point is, they wish the ranking algorithm to be seen as some divine choice and hence not subject to criticism rather than a mathematical extension of human choices.<p>So has google put a finger on the scale to rank google properties more highly?  Based on their behavior with the results page (vs yelp, for example), I would be surprised if they do, but not very surprised.<p>Nonetheless, now that google search results are the internet for many people -- and chrome&#x27;s address bar is used to help blur that distinction -- it&#x27;s fair that people outside google, represented by governments, start having a say in who shows up and where.

So if you are shorting Bitcoin futures, someone else is going long on Bitcoin futures; you never take a position against the exchange itself.<p>Therefore all contracts are verified by the central counterparty; us. There is risk involved for the exchange when you offer leverage, which is why we offer sane leverage (3.3x to 5x, not 10-20x like our Chinese competitors).<p>There are a few schools of thought for managing this risk. Our competitors simply do their best to liquidate users when their equity gets too low. This is tough to do without loss; on 20x leverage, a 5% move will wipe out all value in an account. Bitcoin moves by more than 5% in a day very regularly. These exchanges simply take the loss and spread it out among all their customers. The customers that have made money on a given (weekly,monthly,quarterly) settlement simply have their winnings deducted by the amount of money the exchange has lost.<p>This method is great for gamblers and unscrupulous investors, but in the end it is not much more than a slot machine. It is utterly useless for businesses; you can&#x27;t properly hedge if your profits can be docked at any time because other users have gone bankrupt.<p>Our view at BitMEX is that Bitcoin needs a proper derivatives market so businesses can hedge. Most Bitcoin companies simply sell at spot exchanges to hedge risk, but this has significant downsides. We manage our risk through limited leverage, limits on price movement, and with an advanced liquidation engine that can incrementally liquidate positions in a safe way to prevent major price movements. Our competitors simply place a market order for the full position&#x27;s value, which leads to the dreaded &quot;margin call cascade&quot; (of course, &quot;margin call&quot; is the wrong word here, but on most Bitcoin exchanges there is no distinction between &quot;margin call&quot; and &quot;liquidation&quot;).<p>These and other unique buffers give us the ability to guarantee settlements.",1429381793

Martin read Brunner years before he used the same tactic in ASOIAF), while the novel&#x27;s ostensible hero, Austin Train, a legendary environmental activist leader who has gone into hiding and spends the book preparing to mysteriously re-emerge, turns out — well, I don&#x27;t to spoil things; not what I expected, anyway.<p>Even more than character development, the sense of impending doom lies thick.

If you instead spend three hours reading 1000-word articles (let’s say, 40 of them), you will probably have learned a small amount, which is an improvement.  If, by contrast, you spend three hours reading 50 000 words (say, a few chapters of a Murakami book), or a quarter of Olin Shivers’s dissertation, you will probably acquire some new ideas that will stay with you for the rest of your life.  There’s a point at which this becomes counterproductive; if you read a book in a day, it won’t stay with you as well as if you read it over the course of a week, and the week also gives you time to reflect on other connections.<p>My thesis: being able to focus your attention on interesting things is only valuable if you then <i>do</i> actually focus your attention on them.

If you find yourself needing this, then you&#x27;re missing a call in a spot higher up the stack ( event handler, websocket callback, etc.. ).<p>2.  $timeout is acceptable if you legitimately need a delay - don&#x27;t use it for control flow, ever.  $evalAsync can be useful for coalescing multiple calls to a function into one during a digest cycle.<p>3.  Minimal DOM manipulation.  I will not say there&#x27;s never a use case for DOM manip, but it should <i>not</i> be your first instinct most of the time.  If it is, then take a step back and grab some coffee, go for a walk, and then look again.  Often times, I&#x27;ll use a variable instead and add a watcher on it in my directive to do the DOM manip.  One can argue that it&#x27;s needless overhead having the watcher, however I feel it&#x27;s more in the spirit of Angular and does not contribute excessive overhead.  If it does, then you can start making optimizations in the future after it&#x27;s been proven that they&#x27;re actually a problem.",1429381050

9400444,comment,9388751,9388751,0,0,devonkim,,,"I&#x27;ve written a number of IP cores with FPGAs over 10 years ago and the sad fact is that the same problems and criticisms that led me to forget about using them anywhere than at some big company are still very relevant today. Problems include:<p>* Hostile toolchains for independent developers / engineers. Lack of reasonably useful toolchains including simulators, synthesis tools, the works. iVerilog has been lame before in my experience, for example.
* Expensive hardware that&#x27;s artificially inflated in price due to lack of commodity concerns (perhaps lack of competition in general)
* Toolchains unfriendly / bad UX for traditional software developers. I read a Linux Journal article with a Python-like HDL featured - myHDL and its traction is what I suspected it would be - irrelevant to anyone but hobbyists, and hobbyists have basically zero input into the industry unlike software&#x27;s dynamics. After working with different compiler vendors and doing some research in the space (GPGPUs completely destroyed the market like I figured back then because software developer use cases of hardware tend to be very narrow uses of FPGA / ASIC capabilities - parallel processing or custom FPUs for boutique DSPs being typical), I&#x27;ve seen rather little progress compared to the leaps in software productivity. Even the recent Scala-based Chisel language seems a bit trite as well and more research-ware that won&#x27;t be adopted by manufacturers probably because...
* Most FPGA and ASIC targeted use cases for HDLs are primarily for <i>hardware</i> engineers first most, not people that are software engineers first. When people get specs on hardware, nobody really cares about the HDL code written as much as whether the SOC has a lot of test benches and they look at the block diagrams instead of the HDL typically and things tend to be developed typically as black boxes due to how IP cores work (per industry conventions).
* Compilers for hardware languages have had tons of issues for a long, long time because expressing bit math and signals (especially the analog extensions to VHDL and Verilog) have been really cumbersome with imperative style languages. Historically, we&#x27;ve gotten far more concise, legible results with language clarity by using conventions from Matlab and R than with C and Ada, but Verilog and VHDL are just too damn dominant and most experienced electrical engineers that are hardware gurus really do not like to learn a lot of new languages and semantics unlike how software developers tend to behave typically.<p>However, I&#x27;ve always felt that hardware engineers and software engineers should talk a lot more, and the ever-increasing gap has been a disappointment for me. I&#x27;m totally on-board with a lot of testing for software, but at the same time I understand that software is typically designed with the expectation to change things frequently while hardware is typically written to be reliable-first and to go through insanely rigorous testing because you cannot patch hardware. Most IP cores that are distributed a lot have at least 2.5 times as much test benches / harnesses as the code to actually do the work. Hardware has much more rigorous specification designs than software typically though, so this is possible at least. Haskell&#x27;s QuickCheck would be totally helpful for how a lot of hardware is tested because nowadays you can&#x27;t test all the combinations of signals on, say, a 128-bit bus in a reasonable amount of time. So test benches are full of tons of statistical functions and are sometimes even generated with machine learning techniques to exercise the most likely to fail use cases and states. This all goes out the window if you switch languages typically. That kind of attention to testing is almost unheard of in software in my experience.<p>A trivial-seeming example of how HDLs are hostile to software developers is the difference when you write a switch statement in C versus in an HDL (tremendous apologies, I haven&#x27;t written Verilog in 10 years):<p><pre><code>  switch (input) {
    case b&#x27;10: 
      output <= input & inputB;
      break;
    case b&#x27;01:
      output <= input ^ inputB;
  }
</code></pre>
vs.<p><pre><code>  switch (input) {
    case b&#x27;10: 
      output <= input & inputB;
      break;
    case b&#x27;01:
      output <= input ^ inputB;
      break;
    default:
      output <= b&#x27;00;
  }
</code></pre>
Omitting a default case causes a latch to be produced by the compiler, so the two are VERY different and will punish software developers that like to use shortcuts (my Perl background bit me real hard trying to do shortcuts in the Verilog compilers I used before - I was even more surprised to see my C-style macros failing after only 2 levels of indirection to try to make my cores more configurable, forcing me to rewrite my cores often). Unlike in software where something like whether a switch statement becomes a jump table or a series of if statements isn&#x27;t typically make or break, in hardware the difference between a single clock cycle being used up or not is massively important.<p>After basically yelling at my compiler and tools oftentimes for doing things that defied their documentation enough times, waiting hours for place and routes to finish (they ARE NP hard, after all), and uncovering so many edge cases in FPGAs that required use of clock trees and manual refinement of the resulting FPGA image file, I realized that this just wasn&#x27;t going to get much better of an experience because these levels of concerns are what hardware engineers are responsible for tuning themselves and you just can&#x27;t abstract and delegate it away.<p>I asked my boss back then why Intel shouldn&#x27;t enter the market and he responded &quot;because if it&#x27;s commoditized, the entire industry will lose all their margins because the market for FPGAs is primarily large company hardware engineers.&quot; It took over 10 years later for Intel to finally buy Altera it seems... and in the meantime we had an incredible number of things happen across the spectrum while FPGAs are still practically the same user experience and fundamental architectures (nothing like SMT happened in FPGA land really, no really revolutionary compilers to make writing hardware super easy).<p>There&#x27;s a gazillion more reasons why we&#x27;ll see more people using the Raspberry Pi and Arduino for learning to tinker with hardware, and Xilinx, Altera, etc. have always been the way they are now, so my decision to just never go back to the fun world of FPGAs seems to have been justified, sadly.",1429380937

2. Don&#x27;t loan money to a business partner.
3. You are wrong about many things. Most importantly, you are wrong about how much people value quality vs. price. Your customer is the shopkeep--not the end user.
4. Don&#x27;t hire inexperienced people.
5. Be more judicious in deciding if something is worth getting upset over.
6. Being a perfectionist will cripple your profits. Just get it done.
7. Be calculated in every decision you make. That&#x27;s the only way to make money.
8. Focus on consumable goods. Sell razor blades, not razors.",1429380181

It can fail only through incompetence or criminality. A futures exchange/broker has trading risk - they have to be able to collect from losing traders.<p>They say &quot;BitMEX stands behind all trades.&quot;  That will probably break when someone suffers a big loss and doesn&#x27;t pay up.

The best test (it even rhymes!). That's what Google do obsessively, too. (see Marissa Mayer vs Doug Brown thread)<p>I think there's a lot to learn from the affiliate industry. It's silly to get into usual moralistic standpoint: usually they have less skills than a regular wizz kid, and, somehow, manage to make better money.<p>EDIT: It's also good to have a broader perspective.

For example, typical affiliate payouts for many products are in the 30% range.  Many startups want to have many, many millions in revenue.  Once you start talking about a million here and a million there you have to ask yourself what it is about the affiliate that the merchant can't bring in house.<p>In some cases, the answer is that the affiliate's aggregation capabilities provides value -- hotels would be a good example of this.  In many cases, the answer is NOT pleasant.  Sometimes the right hand doesn't really want to know what the left hand is doing.<p>The other alternative is somehow making a scalable business out of bundling lots and lots of little merchants together and providing scalable affiliate services to all of them.  By that metric, Google is almost the biggest affiliate in history.  (You can even do CPA bidding!)<p>Relatedly, Google takes huge, huge amounts of money from advertisers whose hands are less than clean.

modules with low coupling. I'm happy until a new feature comes along
which cannot be implemented without destroying the independence of the
existing modules. Then there are two options: Either I redesign the
system based on the new requirements or hack the new feature into the
old architecture. Both alternatives make me sad.<p>I recognize some repetitive pattern in my code. So I create some
straightforward abstraction that removes the redundancy. I'm happy
until the pattern appears again, but this time in some slightly
different form so that the old abstraction can't handle it. Then I
change the abstraction to include the new case. Eventually, I realize
that the abstraction has only complicated the system, because now one
has to understand both the implementation of the abstraction and the
use of it. This make me sad.<p>I'm working on some easy task. I know that I have solved problems like
this many times before. Unfortunately this time my brain just refuses
to solve the problem. Without solving the problem, I go home and think
about pursuing a different career.<p>On the next morning I solve the problem within 5 minutes and I'm glad
to be a programmer.",1265634562

I can't help but notice, however, that there is a difference in ""beauty"" as it applies to fp and oop.<p>A good piece of OOP code is verbose yet simple. It may be a world of nouns, but there's a little tiny chunk of code in there that does one thing and does it well. Beautiful OOP is made for morons. And I mean that as a compliment.<p>FP, on the other hand, couples the data structures so tightly in with the code that I'm always the human linker -- keeping track of dozens of different things at the same time. But when done well, all of this incredible amount of work just falls out of a line or two of code. You have to keep track of the pieces, but your opportunity to combine them in cool ways is incredibly higher. Beautiful FP is like watching origami -- from a simple base somehow something beautifully complex emerges.<p>Then there's the difference between beautiful startup code -- you have no idea of the problem so it is able to pivot in multiple directions quickly, and beautiful commercial code -- you know the problem and you've met the solution in the most maintainable, understandable way possible.<p>The term ""beautiful"" is overloaded too many times. And good coders aren't looking for artistic perfection. I agree with the author: it's a bad idea.",1265634492

You're right about not expecting the simplicity and elegance to remain, but there's a huge difference in manageability toward the end of each system's life.  Get the foundation right; the house will follow.",1265634464

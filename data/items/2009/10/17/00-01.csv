886418,comment,885856,886388,0,0,whalesalad,,,"I'm a gadget nut and after a couple years as an iPhone user... I decided it was time to take the jump to an android powered phone. Aside from the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack w/o a usb adapter, I really like the phone I chose, the MyTouch from T-Mobile (HTC Magic).<p>Prior to rooting (you can think of it as equivalent to jailbreaking on an iPhone) my phone and installing Cyanogen's mod I was pretty unhappy with the phone overall. Sure it was a great device, but it was still shadowed by my iPhone experience. The keyboard was slow, not as responsive. I can type real fast on an iPhone, but on the Android phone I felt handicapped.<p>After rooting the phone and installing Cyanogen, as well as the HTC keyboard (instead of the base Android one), I absolutely love it. I have a slight glitch which has been apparently found out to be a small kernel bug (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=329"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=329</a>), but my experience hasn't been bad as some of the other people.<p>Performance is on-par with my iPhone now, especially with the keyboard. I really like HTC's keyboard. Lots of enhancements with the Cyanogen mod as well. That's one thing I really love about the Android community, is the open-ness (duh) and the number of ROM's out there you can play around with.<p>One thing I don't like (which isn't so much of a problem with a rooted phone and the underground hacker community) is all of the platform specific stuff out there from companies like HTC and Motorola. The HTC Hero is a perfect example of a phone with a totally modified Android OS that looks great, but is specific to that device. Why can't I run that on my Magic? Why can't someone run it on their Moto phone? You can of course, as I mentioned previously thanks to the community, but why aren't all of these awesome things being made available to everyone? It's an open handset alliance after all.<p>Anyway, sorry for that incoherent blob of text. I was so happy to scan through these screenshots today, I'm <i>super</i> excited for 2.0!",1255738860

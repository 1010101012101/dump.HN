His possible arrest in Sweden is dependent on him being interrogated, which can&#x27;t happen because he&#x27;s holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy. The only arrest I&#x27;m aware of is him being on house arrest while the UK courts assessed the validity of Sweden&#x27;s extradition request.<p>>>> given the threat of more arrests he is warranted to ask for amnesty since it can very easily be assumed he will face more unjust treatment<p>I&#x27;d prefer if we didn&#x27;t base international extradition issues on assumptions of further unjust treatment by the &quot;evil&quot; US.<p>>>> Again, he hasn&#x27;t been charged with anything<p>Again, that&#x27;s a idiosyncrasy of Swedish law, not a grand conspiracy to deprive JA of his rights. IF he actually fronted up to the interrogation/second round of questioning by Swedish authorities back in 2010 instead of fleeing the country to the UK none of this would be an issue. He&#x27;s actively been evading possible criminal prosecution for 5 years since and yet we&#x27;re meant to believe it&#x27;s because the US will extradite him from Sweden despite the extradition treaty between those two countries excluding extradition for political or espionage offences or cases involving the death penalty. Furthermore this narrative of extradition from Sweden to the US has been concocted by Assange and his legal team, I can only assume to attempt to keep him from facing prosecution in Sweden. It has zero basis in fact.<p>I understand self preservation is a serious driving force in a person&#x27;s life so I can understand why Assange is doing this. What I can&#x27;t understand is how so many people can wilfully ignore the facts of this situation because they have a personal affinity for one of the interested parties.",1454723262

11046082,comment,11032480,11038134,0,0,OldSchool,,,"I&#x27;ll suggest that the escrow route is an alternative to agreeing to indemnification in a simpler form; I can&#x27;t imagine a situation where having both would be of benefit to the seller at least.<p>I think ideally escrow would nicely encapsulate risk for a seller and ramp it down over time.  When applied to cash it could create tax issues if a payment is recognized as income in one tax year and only becomes available in a subsequent year. For shares received by exchange for existing shares structured as a merger, this is likely solvable. If a selling party holds only stock options though and is issued shares on closing, again, my initial guess would be that would be deemed a &quot;taxable event.&quot; Another aspect of escrow is that it eventually requires sign-off from the buyer to release it to you, effectively giving them control of your proceeds that they might attempt to exercise outside of the original intent of the escrow.<p>So, as for handling your windfall during the indemnification period, yes, purely the simplest approach would be to hold the proceeds in the most risk-free way until your indemnification period ends.<p>This is however, again complicated at least by tax implications if you need some of the money to pay taxes due on cash received in the closing.<p>Furthermore, there is a strong argument for using some cash to hedge against a decline in the value of shares received (if any), simplistically illustrated by purchasing put options on the acquiring company&#x27;s stock, since you&#x27;re forced to hold it throughout some inevitable lockup period. Put options on a reasonably closely-correlated financial instrument might also be viable if the acquiring company isn&#x27;t so large as to have an active options market, since public stock prices seem to move broadly, barring any company-specific failures.<p>To put some entirely fictional numbers to the hedging argument, imagine you&#x27;re obligated to sit on $10M worth of public stock for two years and you could spend $250K cash today to gain a significant level of protection against a drop in the share price. After your two-year wait, you either have $10M or more in stock if the price held or rose ($250K is gone but you spent it on insurance of a sort) or perhaps the stock dropped 80% and you now have $2M in stock but another $4M made back from the put options you bought, so while $6M pre-tax isn&#x27;t $10M, it&#x27;s a lot more than $2M.",1454722838

It displays a preview window inside Atom. Sublime can&#x27;t do this because of the API.<p>Atom has a bunch of Go packages that autoformat on save, provide &quot;intelligent&quot; autocompletion (e.g. type a variable and a dot and it will suggest methods callable on the variable), lint/syntax check, and so on. (In particular, Atom&#x27;s autocompletion mechanism is extensible; plugins can provide completions based on context. Sublime&#x27;s autocompleter is hardwired, I believe.) There are some Go packages for Sublime, but they never worked properly for me. The ones for Atom are quite polished and just work.<p>Sublime plugins can&#x27;t modify the file sidebar. With Atom, I can have the sidebar colorized based on Git status, for example.<p>The color-picker package is great — when editing CSS you can get a little color picker popup for color codes. Again, not possible in Sublime.<p>In short: Sublime has a very limited plugin API that supports very little side from editing text. Atom&#x27;s API opens up a ton of possibilities that simply can&#x27;t be done in Sublime.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/hlIwg5J.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/hlIwg5J.png</a>",1454722593

But that is what the reporter is referring in sentences such as these, which mention &quot;a strict set of rules set by humans&quot;:<p>> <i>But for a time, some say, he [Singhal] represented a steadfast resistance to the use of machine learning inside Google Search. In the past, Google relied mostly on algorithms that followed a strict set of rules set by humans.</i><p>I know because I spoke with Metz at length and was quoted in the article.<p>The Knowledge Graph was, by definition, a rules engine. It was GOFAI in the tradition of Minsky, the semantic web and all the brittleness and human intervention that entailed.<p>What he&#x27;s saying here is that Google has relied on machine learning in the form of RankBrain to figure out which results to serve when it&#x27;s never seen a query before. And the news, in this case, is that statistical methods like RankBrain will take a larger and larger role, and symbolic scaffolding like the Knowledge Graph will take a smaller one.<p>You are right that the most powerful, recent demonstrations of AI combine neural nets with other algorithms. In the case of AlphaGo, NNs were combined with reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search. I don&#x27;t think a rules engine (the symbolic system you refer to) was involved at all there. Nor is it necessary, if by studying the world our algorithms can intuit its statistical structure and correlations without having them hard coded by humans before hand. It turns they do OK learning from scratch, given enough data.<p>So in many cases we don&#x27;t need the massive data entry of a rules engine created painstakingly by humans, which is great, because those are brittle and adapt poorly to the world if left to themselves.<p>The Knowledge Graph is just a way of encoding the world&#x27;s structure. The world may reveal its structures to our neural networks, given enough time, data and processing power.",1454722514

Someone can try to shame them, but it’s not going to have any effect and it’s usually more of a joke.<p>The other consequence of this - and the one that probably scares the most visitors away - is that people can’t really be shamed for being what we would consider horrible people.

Creating the separation between SQL DB and web application allows you to maintain, deploy, fix and upgrade things independently and it&#x27;s easy (maybe not quite as easy as an ORM would make it but not really harder either; you&#x27;re going to have to know how SQL works anyway if you want to effectively optimize and secure your data).<p>Not only that but you can provide far better security controls because you can limit certain users access to certain procedures, never direct access to tables and various other things and if you don&#x27;t do any dynamic SQL in the procedures itself you not only never have to worry about SQL injection but unless there is a critical vulnerability in the SQL system itself it&#x27;s going to be impossible to conduct an injection attack.<p>Yeah you can separate your code to make it easier to deploy separately to get a similar benefit and yeah your code can prevent SQL injections too but it&#x27;s so much more work, more possible points of failure and the differences between databases can really bite you in the ass when you do everything generically.

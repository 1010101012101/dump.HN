8287982,comment,8287479,8287479,3,0,WordSkill,,,"Krugman is a known idiot, I have far more interest in what coherent thinkers such as Joseph Stiglitz have to say on the matter: <a href=""http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-stiglitz-attacks-no-camp-1-3520079"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-i...</a><p>In common with literally all my foreign friends who, like me, have chosen to make Scotland their home, I am mystified that there is any question of rejecting the chance to become an independent country.<p>I do understand that change can be frightening but, on every level, the prospects for a modern, self-governing Scotland are clearly better than remaining as comedy bit-players in an exhausted system designed to serve the needs of another country&#x27;s hereditary elite?<p>The United Kingdom was not chosen by the Scottish people in 1707, it was a stroke of royal power politics. Today, the UK is still pre-occupied with protecting the privilege and private wealth accumulated by the top 1% during the age of empire and is, therefore, laughably unfit to steer our entire population towards the opportunities of the future.<p>Can my Scottish friends not sense that something is wrong when the No campaign keep hammering the same obvious psychological buttons, do they not see this for the slick marketing campaign it is when Alistair Darling and the entire UK media straight-facedly suggest that oil is a curse, because of price volatility, rather than the blessing every other country considers it to be?<p>Is it not insulting when they suggest that, alone among all the peoples of the world, only the Scottish are incapable of democratically determining what is best for them and acting in their own best interests?<p>Even if Scotland did not have extraordinary natural resources that most countries would, quite literally, kill for, a rich diversity of resources that, per head of population, very few countries in the world can rival (<a href=""http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bwh9F9LCcAAKBSV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bwh9F9LCcAAKBSV.jpg</a>), there is something much more important, and this is what I, an Irishman who has lived in Scotland for 12yrs, and ALL my foreign friends here - Canadians, Australians, English, German, Americans, Thais and French etc - can see so clearly:<p>A people who gain the chance to govern themselves, who become the masters of their own destiny, they grow. They cast aside of the feeling of being second-best, they lose the bitterness, the chip on their shoulder. Whatever the challenges a small nation might face, nothing is as important as the feeling of pride and self-worth that come with being a first-class citizen in your own country.<p>This isn&#x27;t just some abstract, wishy-washy point about feeling good; the future we are heading into is one in which self-confidence, the ability to believe in ourselves and our abilities, will be a fundamental driver of business, trade and innovation. It is vital that Scottish children take on the world with the same natural self-confidence as children from Oxford or London, that they be the ones taking chances and setting up companies, not the ones deciding that, on balance, it is probably best to play it safe and aim for a dull but secure job.<p>Forgive me, but I must be frank: the Scottish character has been affected by three centuries of playing second fiddle to England, there is more than a smidgen of self-hate and self-destructiveness in the Scottish temperament, and the self-harm that George Monbiot writes about (<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/scots-independence-england-scotland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/scots-i...</a>) is likely to manifest itself spectacularly on polling day. That is why the No campaign will keep remorselessly pounding away at those deeply embedded fears and self-doubts right up until election day, because fear is how you hold people down.<p>They will keep pretending that it is about Alex Salmond, while conveniently ignoring real issues, such as the fact it was Scotland&#x27;s oil which made Sterling a petrocurrency, propping up its value during the Thatcher years and allowing London to become a world centre of finance, all while lying about how much oil they were extracting. None of this is secret, it is all there in government papers released under the thirty-year rule:<p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/how-black-gold-was-hijacked-north-sea-oil-and-the-betrayal-of-scotland-518697.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/how-black-...</a><p>... and this is how the last gasp of empire looks: keep jock in harness by somehow persuading him that he needs the English rather than the other way round. This is the system, it has been perfected over centuries, it is insatiable and, no matter what they or their local sock puppets say, it does not have your best interests at heart.<p>I think the No campaign will win. Despite the recent dramatic gains by the Yes side, I believe the No campaign, with the entire weight of the London press and the BBC behind them, are tapping into rich and reliable reserves of self-doubt in the Scottish psyche. This saddens me greatly, as I believe the eventual realisation of what has been thrown away will only further poison the Scottish soul.<p>Despite having been sold to the electorate as a bulwark against change, the United Kingdom will change beyond recognition in the coming years. English politics will continue to be driven rightwards by the UKIP agenda, regardless of what the Scottish people want, and we may well find ourselves out of the European Union anyway, courtesy of The Daily Mail.<p>Certainly, the age of austerity and privatization will continue to drive down the &quot;Barnett formula&quot; money you are supposedly receiving in return for your oil propping up the London Exchequer, but more devastating will be the growing sense that, yet again, the Scottish have blown it, losing the one chance you had to disentangle and discover who you really are.",1410220724

It&#x27;s not just theory, the chargeback thing isn&#x27;t even a problem, it&#x27;s not a consumer protection that&#x27;s needed or asked for.<p>Why is this so? Because of the nature of business. A business, like Amazon, has a brand. It&#x27;s in business for decades, makes billions of dollars doing legitimate work. The moment Amazon takes $400 for a new phone and doesn&#x27;t send it, then lies about it, and does this quite a few times, that&#x27;s the moment the billion-dollar brand and business collapses. The chance that Amazon will scam you and you needing to resort to a chargeback is 0.<p>What about the other way around? What&#x27;s the chance that I, with one of the 100 creditcards I can get, make an account, for every creditcard I have, and send $400 for a phone, receive the phone, then do a fraudulent chargeback? It&#x27;s small, but it happens. Despite this also being rare, it happens orders of magnitude more often than the other way around. Now Amazon is out of a product and out of $400. It costs them too much to prosecute me (their 0.35% profit margin on that sale won&#x27;t cover 10 seconds of their lawyers). All they do is blacklist the creditcard.<p>As you can see, this system invites fraud. It rewards criminals in a way that&#x27;s pretty easy to get away with half of the time. Amazon now loses money, which means it (and every other business in the world) increase their prices a little bit, charging honest customers. We collectively pay for this consumer protection that is often used for fraud.<p>Guess what, bitcoin can have chargebacks TOO. IF a consumer really wants it, let him go to a third-party business and say look, I don&#x27;t trust Amazon, I will pay 1% extra for you to insure the delivery. If I don&#x27;t get the product, you pay me back the full amount and deal with Amazon yourself if you want. That market will arise if there is demand for it. Difference? In this market ONLY the people who don&#x27;t trust the merchant they pay for the risk. (very rarely do I buy from a business I don&#x27;t know, can&#x27;t locate on a map, or that doesn&#x27;t have a business registration, and as such I have never in the past decades of my life done a chargeback). All the other people now don&#x27;t have to pay for the chargeback fraud.<p>Not only is this cheaper for all but it&#x27;s also more equitable. Chargebacks ARE useful in one circumstance, which is when e.g. you bought 1 month at the gym, and they keep charging you for 12 months. But bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have this problem because it has PUSH payments. YOU decide when to pay (excuse the arrogant capital letters lol, I know). Credit has pull payments, of course in a system where anyone can take money from your account is it useful to charge that back. But that protection has no need in a push-system.<p>- I don&#x27;t need 10 currencies I&#x27;d be comfortable holding<p>Point is that there are hundreds of currencies, and most are shit. So while I&#x27;m comfortable holding my currency (euro), and you probably your dollar (as would I), that luxury doesn&#x27;t extend to a few billion others for whom bitcoin may be viable. As for your quote of bitcoin volatility, I&#x27;m talking long-term here. A currency that goes from 1 to 100 to 1000 to 1m users of course is volatile. But when that settles down, the inherent inflationary properties (generally the root of volatility issues in any economy) have low-volatility.<p>Besides that, I already mentioned you can lock in the price of bitcoin in a national currency. I&#x27;m not saying we should all HAVE bitcoin, but I&#x27;m saying we can benefit from using it. That could indeed mean regular joes owning $100 (in bitcoin), pegged to the dollar price built on a back-end derivative market for investors, and using it as if it was paypal. That could happen, too. People are working on that, e.g. the founder of CNET who launched Bitreserve.<p>- My credit card company provides fraud protection for when my card is stolen, my BTC wallet does not<p>Circle, Xapo and Coinbase all insure bitcoins already, more insurance services will inevitably follow. The point is, whatever creditcard theft happens that you get reimbursed for, someone has to pay for it, and that someone is you and everyone else, and the amount it costs you and everyone else is the average cost of theft per person. Same with bitcoin. But if bitcoin has more secure properties (and I believe it does, push vs pull, lower chance of fraud, multi-sig, no possibility of getting your wallet stolen), then whatever it costs to insure against bitcoin theft will likely be lower on average than the cost of insuring against creditcard theft, meaning it&#x27;s a cheaper system. Any of today&#x27;s financial services can be offered for bitcoin, too, but due to its generally better properties, at a cheaper rate. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cool. Bitcoin is a protocol-layer, you can build anything on top if you want.<p>-  Until bitcoin gains market share<p>Agreed that there are quite a few issues that may not be issues if bitcoin gains market share. A bit like the internet: until internet speed becomes faster, I&#x27;m not going to be able to make phonecalls, videochat, download movies, watch live news etc on my computer, or hell even my phone - guy in 1995. That&#x27;s not a reason to walk away, it&#x27;s a reason to be excited.",1410219795

Any sale they make in bitcoin is one they save on their margins. Just because it&#x27;s not applicable to 100% of sales doesn&#x27;t mean it has no effect.<p>On point 2, that&#x27;s true but is the discount 0? Because BitPay processes bitcoin payments at 0% right now (and has billion-dollar clients like Newegg already), with enterprise options. Point is, whatever discounts CC can make to large clients, bitcoin processors can do, too. Only more, because an average bitcoin order is inherently cheaper.<p><i>Fraud is as applicable to credit cards as to bitcoin</i><p>Absolutely, but there&#x27;s obviously different levels of security. e.g. say I tell you &#x27;let&#x27;s move from checks to creditcards, it&#x27;s much safer&#x27;. It&#x27;d be pretty silly to say &#x27;no, creditcards also have fraud&#x27;. Yes, but checks are worse. Why? Due to its inherent design.<p>The inherent design of creditcards (1950s technology, by the way) is writing all the security details (i.e. your money-vault password) on a plastic card. And handing over that information to anyone you&#x27;re paying, and then they can (and often do) keep that information on file.<p>Imagine you want to pay with cash at a supermarket and have to hand over your wallet to the company. And when you&#x27;re done paying and leave, they still have access to your wallet for years.<p>It&#x27;s a security nightmare. Bitcoin is different in that you don&#x27;t send access to your money to a business, you just send money. It&#x27;s by design more secure.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the bitcoin ecosystem is a secure paradise, far from it. But I do truly believe that bitcoin&#x27;s properties allow an ecosystem with less fraud. Things like multi-sig can create (in fact, already exist) third-party custodians who have no exclusive access to your money and just act as a signing counterparty, for example.<p>Chargebacks are an interesting topic that I&#x27;d be willing to talk about more if you want to know. But it&#x27;s not a key issue. If it does turn out that chargebacks are wanted by customers, they can be built into the bitcoin ecosystem through third parties like today, keeping all the other benefits of bitcoin. But more importantly, chargebacks as they exist today are pretty shitty, invite fraud, create huge costs, paid for by the customer, and are barely needed. If you want to know the arguments, let me know I&#x27;ll write them up for you, wall o text already.<p><i>yet better systems are emerging to solve those problems (Ripple, Stellar, Ether)</i><p>I disagree on the point of remittance, but I&#x27;m keeping an eye out for sure!

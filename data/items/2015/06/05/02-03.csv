9663625,comment,9663421,9663571,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Things are pretty bad on the proprietary front, in the sense that they can&#x27;t even be installed on a modern kernel at the moment (Fedora 21 has too new of a kernel to use AMD proprietary drivers, for example, and I haven&#x27;t even tried with Fedora 22).<p><i>But</i>, the Open Source drivers for AMD is actually seemingly in a better state than the nVidia Open Source drivers. According to benchmarks I&#x27;ve seen they perform at a little better than half the speed of the proprietary drivers. For me, this means I can actually play 3D games like Rust at 1080P with reasonable, but not impressive, frame rates on my R290 card running under Linux, without having to install the proprietary drivers. That&#x27;s a surprising and pleasant state of affairs. Admittedly, the R290 is ridiculously huge and I should be able to do more than barely play games at 1080P at a decent frame rate. But, it may be the first time getting a 3D game running was as easy as &quot;install OS, install Steam, install game, start game, play&quot;.<p>Also, I love that games are being ported to Linux at the fastest pace in history because of Steam machines. I play and buy a lot more games because of it.",1433473055

Bingo cards for teachers. Well, first of all teachers don&#x27;t typically have a lot of spare money. They aren&#x27;t generally thought of as spendthrifts. Many of them are already spending their own money on classroom supplies, and I&#x27;m supposed to get them to spend more? My thought would be that the only way to make money selling to educators is to sell to school districts. That sounds a lot like enterprise sales, only probably even more political. Doesn&#x27;t seem like a very lucrative idea.<p>So I don&#x27;t think the idea would have appealed to very many people to begin with. Even fewer would have had the motivation to actually create the product and do the work to market it, and go through the effort of A/B testing idea after idea to figure out the best way to sell it. And even if they had, the world is a big place. No business has a lock on 100% of its market.<p>The idea is something, but it&#x27;s hardly the whole enchilada.",1433473047

9663595,comment,9662338,9662981,0,0,kijin,,,"> <i>(I&#x27;m sort of curious how people still have trouble with cert chains, given how long this has been a requirement for all CAs.)</i><p>There are several reasons for widespread confusion:<p>1. Different web server software have different ways to install intermediate certificates. Apache wants them to be in a separate file, nginx wants them concatenated with the main certificate.<p>2. The same certificate can take different chains of trust depending on the client. For example, recently issued PositiveSSL certificates come with two intermediate certificates, but most browsers already trust the second one. So a lot of people just install the first intermediate certificate and call it a day. This setup blows up as soon as you try to run some sort of API on your server (accessed with curl), because unlike browsers, the cacert package on most distros don&#x27;t contain the second intermediate.<p>3. The certificates themselves are just a bunch of random letters delimited by a line of dashes. It&#x27;s not clear at all in which order you should cat them together, and most GUI tools for viewing certificates don&#x27;t clearly indicate the relationship between certificates, either.<p>Hopefully, the shell scripts provided by Let&#x27;s Encrypt will prevent most of the obvious misconfigurations.",1433472484

You essentially want me to show where they reveal it. A tall order but I&#x27;ll try anyway. Yahoo fought the FISA court, lost, and others were shown same decision showing resistance would be treated criminally [1]. Lavabit was ordered to give up their key to FBI, not talk about it, and lie to users about their privacy. (Google court docs if you doubt last part.) Finally, the ECI-classified leaks have a slide that says the &quot;FBI compels&quot; [2] the cooperation of U.S. companies with NSA&#x27;s secret program(s). Compel is undefined. Yet, FBI is a LEO and involuntary compliance with them usually follows threats, yes? The same term is also used in this [3] document citing the specific, federal laws. Both are consistent with Yahoo&#x27;s claims and leverage same laws.<p>So, I believe that the FBI and NSA might have worked together to use legal threats related to Patriot Act to force companies to comply with SIGINT-enabling for collection purposes. The other ECI leaks mention U.S. companies that were cooperative and made their systems &quot;exploitable&quot; for &quot;SIGINT-enabling.&quot; So, they offer money first and call the FBI if that doesn&#x27;t work. Almost everyone caved so I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s a significant, legal threat there.<p>They&#x27;re not telling you in detail because it&#x27;s classified: releasing the info is a felony. Who would after seeing what happened to other whistleblowers...

I&#x27;m making a strictly stronger claim - backed by the brunt of articles - which is that China was purposefully performing a counter-espionage operation that involved Google because Google had (and has) a partnership with US intelligence.<p>You being in the role and expertise that you are - excluding Operation Aurora for now because you seem to have a certain characterization of it - you know that China and the US hack each other for <i>strategic purposes</i> and that when China hacks the US it is not about dissidents.<p>We can&#x27;t predict an alternate history here whether China would have gone after Google for other reasons. What we do know is that China went after the intelligence system linked up to GMail and used it for counter-espionage purposes. One Google personal relations spokesperson did say they suspected China of using the system to collect information of terrorists and dissidents as well.<p>Attributing motive of course changes the narrative. Making it sound like China wanted to hack Google for the sole purpose of getting to dissidents makes it sound all spooky and evil. The reporting that has China hacking Google to track down terrorists and dissidents usually &#x27;forgets&#x27; to mention the counter-espionage link at all or that the database they accessed was for law enforcement or that they gained access to Google&#x27;s systems exclusively through this system; so I tend to believe the reporting and sources that include more, rather than less, information.<p>There&#x27;s purpose behind casting doubt on the intentions of China and the context of the compromise: this is known as spin. Spin is important - for PR and for propaganda - but if you want people to have a real conversation you&#x27;ve got to do what you can to minimize it.",1433472140

([&] technically, this is a simplification because encryption tends to map a given number on an entire set of other numbers). What the FBI is asking for, is that some number mapping functions would be declared illegal. But where is that list of illegal number mapping functions? The problem that arises now, is that no matter how long their list of illegal number mapping functions, it will always be possible to design a number function that is not on their list but that would still be entirely valid to use for encryption. Furthermore, how can they actually enforce a law that says that particular number functions would be illegal? You see, they do not like that people use encryption functions on their numbers and they also do not like it when it rains. In both cases, however, their desires cannot overrule the laws of nature.",1433470743

9663447,comment,9661848,9662412,0,0,csandreasen,,,"There are a few federal cases that say otherwise. In US v. Kirschner[1], it was ruled that forcing the defendant to reveal his password through a grand jury subpoena was a violation of his 5th Amendment rights. The prosecution used a loophole for In re Boucher[2]: though the defendant still had a 5th Amendment right to not reveal his password, he was required to decrypt his hard drive in order to produce files under subpoena that he had already admitted were in his possession. Because he had already incriminated himself by revealing to a border patrol agent that his laptop contained child pornography, he no longer had a 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination for the charges of possessing child pornography.<p>As I mentioned in a post above[3], in the case against Ramona Fricosu she didn&#x27;t have a 5th Amendment right to not produce her password partly because she was granted immunity for any evidence that would have been collected from it (but her husband would not be).  If you have evidence of a crime, you are required to provide to the courts when requested.  You have the right to not provide evidence or testimony which incriminates yourself - if you cannot be incriminated for it, you no longer have the right to withhold it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cyb3rcrim3.blogspot.com/2010/04/passwords-and-5th-amendment-privilege.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyb3rcrim3.blogspot.com/2010/04/passwords-and-5th-ame...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cyb3rcrim3.blogspot.com/2009/03/5th-amendment-bummer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyb3rcrim3.blogspot.com/2009/03/5th-amendment-bummer....</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9662945"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9662945</a>",1433469609

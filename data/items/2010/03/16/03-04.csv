I'd introduce another colour to your palette as it's a bit limited right now. With the disabled button in the bottom right, explain underneath that it will activate when ""x"" more picks have been made. As picks are made (and there are, say, 10 left), highlight the missing ones with yellow or red perhaps. When I was mucking around, I missed a couple.<p>The name is a bit scammy (everyone is skeptical of anything with ""bet"" in it) so you could consider something with ""Challenge"" instead. Or keep the nice, short URL, and bring ""Challenge"" into the heading.<p>I run www.hoops.com.au which is an Australian basketball forum and can plug your site there if you'd like. Not sure how many people there are Twitter users though. I also have a few basketball people (players, bloggers, fans) following me on Twitter if you want me to spread the word.

You're not in a position where liquidity concerns wouldn't pop up, so having access to your money (should you need it) is important. Angel investing means tying down your cash for years...<p>I personally suggest you follow Nassim Taleb's advice (he of Black Swan fame), which you seem to be doing by keeping the majority in conservative,safe investments and looking to score big with the remaining. If you're looking for home-runs, I suggest options trading. There's a lot of volatility in the market, and if you time things right you should be able to generate a handsome return.<p>Good luck!",1268711574

But my question for HN would be - would you consider funding a adult themed start up for the YC program, and is there a line which you wouldn't cross?<p>Three categories of adult themed I might be thinking of:<p>""Maxim"" style, where it's targetted at males, but doesn't have nudity.<p>""Playboy"" style, which is similar to ""Maxim"" style but does have nudity.<p>""Porntube"" style which is full on pornography.<p>Personally I think there is big potential in the disjointed and mostly pirated adult themed sites of today. Three benefits I see of this business could be:<p>- easy(easier) to gain traction, several sites I know which launched in the 2008-2009 time frame have reached top 100 sites globally.\n- lack of innovation in this space, mostly pirated content and taking an existing paradigm and switching it to adult themed (playboy does an online version of their magazine, various you tube copy cats)\n- large profit potential, I know several low(er) traffic sites which are making plenty off ads, there is an IPO potential here I'm sure<p>Long story short, I have several ideas for adult themed ""hacks"" which could be big.<p>But the fact reminds I know of no YC funded adult themed web sites and am not sure the YC program would support such a thing.<p>I posted this to HN also to generate some hopefully insightful discussion.",1268711375

I would get letters from publishers saying, ‘Why do you allow negative reviews on your website? Why don’t you just show the positive reviews?’ One letter in particular said, ‘Maybe you don’t understand your business.

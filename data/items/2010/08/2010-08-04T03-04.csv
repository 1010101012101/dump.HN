External ones are the custom syntax you talk of, internal are DSLs that use features or quirks of a host language to appear different.<p>XML or SQL are external DSLs, much of the cool Ruby stuff like Rake and Rails are internal DSLs. The examples presented are all internal (presumably for a good reason). There are advantages to both approaches.

If you don't accept reality, you are losing out. Not just on what is actually happening, but it is how to build confidence in yourself. ""I am in a terrible situation, but by my ability to think of my feet and provide for myself when I needed it, I am very capable.""

1573603,comment,1571231,1571231,0,0,elai,,,"To be honest I'm glad that professors are doing more research and instructors are more pure instructors.   The typical professor has 4 jobs: Researcher, Fundraiser, Teacher and Evaluator.  They all have a conflict of interest with each other in some way and they'll all steal your shower focus.  If they were all separated, universities could provide much better services in each job category. I remember Knuth saying something along the lines of ""I retired so I can actually focus on research and attend less meetings"".  Students won't have to deal with the scheduling nightmare that is final exams because professors are too valuable to provide flexible (scheduling wise) examination services.  Things like back to back finals or having them 3 days after the 'get all of your large projects in' end of classes rush don't have to happen anymore!  People who want to interact with professors can come on as undergrad research assistants/apprentices and actually learn some research vs. some extension of high school.   Professors wouldn't have to deal with something alot of them aren't that good at and most dread and actually get the grants they need!",1280894175

And not only that, but github was quickly adopted in the founders' workplaces at the time, giving them time to focus on it and refine it without giving up an income.  Dogfooding is a common theme in startups and it's worth noting that 37signals' Basecamp product was, as I understand it, built with the a very similar purpose. Initially it was a tool for them to help manage their own projects first and something they could charge for second, built under similar conditions where they already had a business designing client websites, providing them an income.<p>A lot of times I dream up projects I think of as potential startups but often have to ask myself, ""Would I actually use this product?""

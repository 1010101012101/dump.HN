6040069,comment,6040026,6040026,1,0,syberslidder,,,"Are you asking how C gets turned into Assembly or how does C interact with the machine? A compiler will compile your C code into assembly and an assembler will produce machine code from your assembly. Everything, no matter how high level it is, eventually is a series of instructions on some physical processor. C is basically just a higher level of representation of the assembly code the machine runs. Since you have experience in both, I&#x27;m sure you can see how  C constructs translate into assembly code. Example how a while or for loop uses conditional branching or how local variables are allocated on the stack. Operating systems are written in a mix of C and assembly, as some things are specific to the machine you are running on. For instance, switching between Protected mode and 32e mode on an x86-64 processor. If you&#x27;re also wondering how your code calls into  operating system calls, it depends on both the processor and the operating system. For example on x86/linux, some arguments are passed via registers and on the stack and a software interrupt is called to transfer control to the OS and have the OS service the request on your behalf, such as file I/O or memory allocation. The more you study both of them, the more apparent it becomes how easily linked they are. I think what most people like about C is that its higher level than assembly but still gives you enough constructs that are close to the machine.",1373780145

A good Perl programmer can do wonders, but if you add just one average programmer to the team (without a very extensive training), he can write stupid things faster than the good programmer could fix, LOL. Then the codebase would be a mess, with things that kinda work but are conceptually wrong or weird for those who really know the language.<p>And the good programmer could do anything in a less eccentric language anyway, so...",1373778978
6040038,comment,6038752,6039697,4,0,wl,,,"I understand that many people have some moral objection to Zimmerman claiming self defense because it is claimed that Zimmerman was pursuing Martin, thus provoking the confrontation. However, that doesn&#x27;t make the behavior illegal and your interpretation of the law claiming that this is harassment is without foundation. One of the first clauses in your cite is &quot;and serves no legitimate purpose.&quot; It is legitimate under the law to check out suspicious behavior, so the statute doesn&#x27;t apply to this situation.<p>Almost universally in American law, the legitimate use of force in self defense can be summed up as &quot;meeting force with force.&quot; Merely pursuing someone is not even assault and committing battery in response is thus unlawful. That is to say, Martin could not have lawfully attacked someone who was merely pursuing him. It would only be lawful self-defense on Martin&#x27;s part if he was repelling physical violence (say, a punch or a kick) initiated by Zimmerman with equal force.<p>Again, though you may have a moral objection to how the law assigns blame here, that doesn&#x27;t change the law.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not an undisputed fact that Zimmerman was chasing Martin. Zimmerman, for one, disputes that. He claims that he got out of the car to see the street sign and then later tried to get a better view of where Martin went. Zimmerman claims he was attacked as he was walking back to his car. You don&#x27;t have to believe Zimmerman, but the evidence presented to rebut his claim was hardly conclusive.<p>And yes, Zimmerman totally had no idea what was on Martin&#x27;s phone and so the evidence is of absolutely no bearing on what Zimmerman thought of Martin. However, Zimmerman claimed that he was attacked by Martin. Nobody saw the beginning of the confrontation, so the only word we have is Zimmerman&#x27;s. The prosecution called Zimmerman a liar on this point, so the evidence could show violent tendencies on Martin&#x27;s part, bolstering Zimmmerman&#x27;s story. It&#x27;s not direct evidence and it&#x27;s certainly prejudicial against Martin, but the defense certainly had the right to try to use it.",1373778959

Reversing a state of the art CPU is not do-at-home stuff.<p>The reason it won&#x27;t help is that the design is _explicitly_ microcoded. E.g. RDRAND triggers running loadable microcode which is supposed to read the real RNG and AES it.  Maybe there is an unrelated &quot;bug&quot; that allows that microcode to be corrupted after some particular instruction sequence happens.

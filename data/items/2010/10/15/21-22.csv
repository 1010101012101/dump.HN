Even if survival and breeding become trivial, sexual selection will continue, and many intelligent people will only want to mate with others of their kind, even if they become overwhelmed numbers-wise.</i><p>And how will this help?<p>I suppose you could model this in a simple way. First you could assume that the IQ of a child is the average of the IQs of its parents  (don't bother telling me that's a false assumption, of course it is, but we're making a simple model here). Then, you could put in certain assumptions about the likelihood of two people meeting, and the likelihood of them mating if they do (lots of adjustable parameters here including the unwillingness to mate with somebody <i>too</i> much smarter or dumber than yourself). Throw in additional ""dumb people breed more"" parameters and see what happens to the simulation.<p>Under certain values of the parameters, you'll just see a slide into idiocracy. But if you make people pickier about their mating partners you might wind up seeing a split into two entirely separate breeding populations -- one smart, one dumb.

Blacksmith would not be able to make any substantial replacement part for AK.. maybe fix a rivet or two, replace a spring, but that's about it.<p>Stamped receiver is not really an issue if you can attain stamping with required precision - which most manufacturers can't do economically, at least not when batches are in ballpark of mere tens of thousands. The earliest attempt at stamping it for original AK failed, so they had to do with milled part for a few years, until the engineers managed to set up reliable stamping. Anyway, the receiver is not that critical part in the weapon, compared to the quality of chamber, barrel and other gas-operated parts. The tolerances there are unattainable by an average machinist shop.<p>The bad rep for accuracy you mention is probably a mix of many factors. The vast majority of it's operators are incompetent shooters. The accuracy gets much worse as the weapon wears through: it might still function perfect after 50 years of use, but it is long past its prime and could have been never properly serviced. Add to that that majority of AKs out there are not really AKs but Chinese-produced Type-56, or Bulgarian, or Iranian etc. clones, and it's no wonder.",1287179592

Most likely if you are a coder, having a well developed opensource project will do wonders for you being able to find your next role.  And if you decide to start a company from the code via a fork, you could actually sell it because you are the original author, and you could dual license it.  Since the code was not work for hire and there were no legal contracts as to the nature of the code you could probably do this.  Get a lawyers advice.<p>Also since you are the developer behind the code base you can probably fork the code faster than your friend.<p>If your friend wants to buy the code from you, maybe you can do a rev share deal with your code and his business.  There would be terms to transfer the IP, but I am sure you can figure that out if you need.  In this case the code would stay private, and you would still have authorship rights to it, but he would have a rev share license to use and to derive from it.<p>I strongly thing that anyone that has asked you to throw out 6 months worth of work is giving bad advice, but this is a difficult situation and you can't expect maximum value out of this.<p>Your goal should be<p><pre><code>  - get something for your time\n  - part ways with this founder\n  - leverage this experience and code base to find a new oppertunity\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=l3GD2EgazCkC&q=retreat+double#v=snippet&q=retreat%20double&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=l3GD2EgazCkC&q=retreat+...</a><p><i>page 48</i>\nSun Tzu - Without a way to retreat, an army fights with double or triple the spirit it would have on open terrain, because death is viscerally present.<p>If you offer your enemy a retreat they may take it.",1287179564

I stopped it 3 months ago and currently have some data on Amazon S3 I had no time to delete.<p>Couple of days ago I received email from Amazon that they could not bill my credit card in order to collect 10 cents for the S3 data. I logged into my account to see what going on and for the first time in my life I saw this message:<p>""You have 7 charges past due. Please pay the amount in full to avoid suspension or termination of your AWS Account.""\n""Select past charges and pay now""<p>So I clicked that and to my surprise I saw this:<p>""Please pay the amount in full to avoid suspension or termination of your AWS account""<p><pre><code>  Billing Period, Bill Details,  You owe\n  June 1, 2009 - June 30, 2009, Bill Details, $ 92.14\n  April 1, 2009 - April 30, 2009, Bill Details, $ 90.12\n  January 1, 2009 - January 31, 2009, Bill Details, $ 91.57\n  November 1, 2008 - November 30, 2008, Bill Details, $ 87.24\n  August 1, 2008 - August 31, 2008, Bill Details, $ 93.78\n  April 1, 2008 - April 30, 2008, Bill Details, $ 88.49\n  February 1, 2008 - February 29, 2008, Bill Details, $ 83.92\n</code></pre>\nTotal Amount You Owe 	$627.26\nAmount You Selected to Pay 	$627.26<p>They did not billed me for February 2008 ?!? 2008! And the total I owe them is $627.<p>I ofter receive messages from Amazon that they could not bill my credit card. This is because I don't use credit card but debit card for online payments. Every time I need to make a payment I go to the bank (which is nearby) and put some money into my account. I do this because:\n1) Bank is nearby and this way I don't have to worry about stolen card details, etc \n2) I have to think twice before buying something big online: first - when I put the money on my account, and second - when I make the real payment<p>I just spent an hour filtering the online billing records on my card for the past three years and it seems according to the records that Amazon is right - they did not billed me, according to my card records. I have difficult time figuring out how this could happened, since AWS billing is a monthly routine for me. Every month when I receive their warning email I go to the bank put enough money into my account and then stopped receiving warning emails from them.<p>HN moment: I have read somewhere on HN, or on HN linked story long time ago that you can have one month past due before they cut you off. And I am sure it was from some CEO of famous startup company, who was explaining how you can play with startup finances by delaying your payments to Amazon with a month (or this is how I understand it at the time).<p>I will talk to my bank on Monday to see if they can provide my with paper billing details regrading Amazon and will probably pay, but I think it is not good business practice to bill your clients 30 months later.<p>Have you ever been more than a month late on AWS billing. What happened?\nWhat will your advice be in this situation?",1287178844

I don't get the point of acknowledgement alone, and since I don't understand the point I'm inclined to infer there's an unspoken motivation behind the discussion.<p>If the point is ""we should be sensitive to one another"" then yes, absolutely.  I personally try hard to do this, towards women, towards beginners, towards people with other domain expertise, towards people with social anxiety... there's a whole bunch of people who have different needs, and programming communities have their own quirky mix.  It's hard, I forget, other people forget, finding a balance between empathy and boundaries can be awkward at times... but eliminating the awkwardness or uncomfortable events is something I personally don't try to do.  Maybe because my own personal demon is alienation, and I know those boundaries are dangerous for me -- they allow me to stick to a comfort zone that I know I need to push my way out of.<p>But... privilege... I just don't know where that fits into this.  There's lots of specific issues I understand and can engage with.  Impostor syndrome (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome</a>) for instance -- this is something I've heard a lot of women feel quite strongly, even in cases when I know the person <i>should not</i> feel that way.  I've felt it too, but I know it's felt more strongly by many women, and if I keep it in mind maybe I can do something positive with that knowledge at some time, to reassure, or perhaps to push someone further knowing they might be self-limiting themselves for the wrong reason.<p>And in these discussions I've heard other useful anecdotes... but in these lists (the article and the list of Male Privileges)... not really.  It feels like there's two categories:<p>1. Don't be a jerk.  Fine, I'll try not to be.  Sometimes I might be.  I'm sorry, I'm only human, I will accept criticism if it is offered.<p>There's also a message: don't let other people be jerks.  I'm not sure how I feel about this.  If I feel strongly like both I and the possible-jerk are really members of the same community, then I would like to make the community better.  But I have no interest in getting outraged because some dude somewhere said something offensive.  Like the comment sections in many gender-diversity-related articles get filled with sexist bullshit (or worse)... I don't know who those people are, I don't recommend anyone even read that shit, and having absolutely no investment in that transient community of commenters I don't see what I (or frankly anyone) should try to do about it.  Just shut the fucking comments down.<p>2. The message to respect boundaries and be professional.  I'm simply not okay with this one.  This isn't just a profession for me, and that's true of my community (and most open source related communities).  I see other professional communities and I am totally disinterested.  To be fair, in those professionalized communities there <i>are</i> a lot more women.  But that's a tradeoff I'm not willing to make.  If I or any other member of the community wishes to profess, on a personal channel (like a Twitter account) that they find women attractive, so be it.<p>Truly misogynist stuff isn't okay (and that does occur, IRC can be particularly bad) and some awareness could be useful there, though I think outrage is not particularly helpful -- it invokes defensiveness instead of empathy.  Outrage strikes me as more to the emotional benefit of the person who is outraged than it is of benefit to the community.",1287177511

You can code heuristics to make that guess.  You can make your heuristics adapt to data you collect, such that they no longer depend on your (flawed and limited) intimate knowledge.<p>Pretend that you assign customers something like a credit score, and simply chunk them into four buckets, from ""people I'm most confident will buy the software"" to ""people I'm least confident will buy the software"".

The Nature have no problem bringing together 2 sexes in 1 body at the pure biological level. \nIt is the behavioral and mental differences of the sexes that make the 2-sex species much stronger than otherwise.",1287176652

Any paper notes, any receipts, anything you did to track time. Document everything, make several copies.  Don't delete information which is inconvenient or contradictory to your story, if it's digital it already exists somewhere else anyway.<p>The conflict may not be resolved in your favor, though the lack of any written contracts, ownership agreements, etc. is going to be a major stumbling block in any litigation against you.<p>Establish a fair value for your labor, what was the opportunity cost to you for the 1200 hours you worked on this instead of getting paid?  Don't go nuts here, if you get paid $50/hr for contract work then that's a reference for a dollar value for your time.<p>Establish a value for —for lack of a better term— your good will: the intangible contributions, ideas batted about, subtle shifts in the product/business strategy, and your ongoing contribution of such.<p>Finally, how much would you take to walk away, handing over the code, all rights, etc, for zero equity, zero credit?<p>Now, ask yourself some questions:<p>- what's the value of the product overall today?  Is that based on real revenue? potential revenue? pie-in-the-sky valuation? sum of all labor/expenses?<p>- is your friendship with your co–founder worth more or less than the ""potential"" monetary value of either the 50% or 40% equity stakes, or the sum of your contributions and your walk-away value?<p>- is the relationship truly poisoned?  Can it be rehabilitated?  Can it be rehab'd with you working together? Or would it be better for you to split amicably?<p>- is any of the monetary value at stake worth more than the potential cost to litigation?  Or than the personal cost if there's a bitter split between you?<p>- would you have come up with this idea, put 1200 hours into it, without the cooperation & dialogue with your co-founder?<p>Talk to a lawyer, learn what your options are.<p>Possibly talk to your ""co-founder"" about mediation, bear the expense equally, it'll cost less than either litigation or years of bitterness.<p>If you have the code base, you have a lot of power.  The worst thing you could do right now is launch the product without having this conflict resolved.<p>I walked away from a startup after 18 months of work when the founder changed the terms of the organization of the company drastically.  A number of us had worked together previously, and worked for that 18 months on mostly a handshake.  We're on cordial terms now, years later, but not what I'd call friends.  My lesson learned there was: if the ownership structure isn't documented promptly and up front, you don't have a startup, you have a lawsuit waiting to happen.",1287176572

If so then this article is beyond disingenuous it is a flat lie. That aside in order for the result to have a bearing on real world test scores it would require someone to be telling women just before their maths test that they're going to fail.

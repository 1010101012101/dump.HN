From the very beginning it points out that the computer can (and SHOULD) represent a beautiful philosophical, even metaphysical, exercise- the understanding of ""how things are done"".<p>Mr. Hickey isn't pulling things out of the air here, there's a long tradition of scientists (and hackers) attempting to communicate to their peers - ""Hey, start treating your practice with some goddamn respect. PLs are not religions. Like music, really, truly, like any art, like any civilization worth continuing - let's keep striving for something better"". Perhaps I'm being overly poetic. But if there's no poetry in your work, then what the f&%k is the point of doing it?<p>EDIT: original poster deleted his post. As much as I like Hacker News, I find the fact that people can ""game"" the karma system by deleting comments clearly destined for down modding lamentable. Perhaps the algorithm for karma should be tweaked so that if you have karma, bravely accepting a brutal down modding for a flawed viewpoint should count for something. That is, if you can't accept being wrong, you probably aren't a hacker worth her/his weight in salt- acceptance of the fact there's always something new to learn should be rewarded after the punishment ;)",1253339968

I won't disclose it but basically the company threatened to sue all involved in spreading it. Afraid, I wrote to Arrington and he assured me he'd rather goto jail than out a source.<p>Of course I never seriously thought the company had a case(especially against me). I just took a public link and fwded it to someone who made it big. Very different from leaking.",1253339882

831678,comment,831421,831667,0,0,natrius,,,"I think you're underestimating the amount of competition needed for a healthy market. I have two choices: Time Warner Cable or AT&T DSL. It's easy to see how they could both decide that, for instance, crushing Hulu is in their best interest. Both of these companies provide television service. If they did this <i>before</i> Hulu got popular, it'd be even easier to avoid angering customers.<p>ISPs are free to charge premium prices for premium services, but it is dangerous to allow them to discriminate between sources of traffic when there are so few competitors.",1253337604

The distinction is so tiny and cosmetic that it's not worth getting all worked up over: Apple is weaseling around its decision, and it's pretty slimy, but it's going a little far to shout ""you lie."" (A ""nuke""? Seriously?)<p>Personally, I wish the hotheaded folks at the 'Crunch would move on to the larger questions: what's the real reason the app was ""not accepted""? Is the decision anticompetitive? What can Google (and its customers) do about it?",1253337493

831674,comment,831441,831441,0,0,CyberFonic,,,"You can't call it a ""contract programming"" situation if there is no contract.  What you are admitting to is quoting a price in haste (to get the job?) and getting it wrong.  I would never provide a quote until the client has provided a specification.  If they can't produce a spec, then I write one for them on a T&M basis and suggest that the client invites others as well to quote on doing the job.  The spec then becomes part of the contract.<p>What the client does with your program once completed should be of no concern to you.  You wrote it for them and it's theirs to use or not use as they please.  As ninjaa points out, you may or may not have intellectual property rights to the program depending on the jurisdiction in which the agreement was reached.<p>If you accept no money and reneg, then your client doesn't have much to grouse about except for the wasted time.  It's obvious that your client wasn't being professional either since they didn't demand a written contract.  You could probably both put this episode behind you and chalk it up to experience.",1253337327

831667,comment,831421,831421,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>While we understand the arguments of the ISPs, the simple truth is that the web will not work if a few Internet providers control what can and cannot be streamed to your computer.  Without net neutrality rules, they could decide to shut off YouTube, Hulu, or any other website for whatever reason they choose.</i><p>As long as there is even a modestly competitive market for internet hookups (more than one firm), then ISPs will compete to serve the interests of the consumers.  Comcast isn't going to shut off Hulu unless it's massively unprofitable.  If there is not a competitive market, then that is the real problem that should be addressed.  You shouldn't limit people's ability to enter into contracts to buy services.  If we want bandwidth to expand, and if we want fast, low latency video and voice connections, cable companies will need to be able to charge premium prices, both to consumers and content providers.  Instead, we are beginning the long process of binding the internet in a layer of legislative gray goo, despite there being no evidence of ISPs acting against the interest of consumers.",1253336462

If it&#x27;s small you may be able to use a rapid prototyping machine (commonly called 3D printers) to create the buck, if you designed it on a computer.<p>To prototype, you can try creating a model out of a different material that&#x27;s easy to shape, then using that buck to make a mold (perhaps out of silicone).

It&#x27;s pretty cheap and effective. I don&#x27;t need more &quot;innovation&quot; in my water delivery.<p>My electricity is delivered by a regulated monopoly provider that answers to a Public Utility Commission and has a strictly regulated profit margin; it&#x27;s purchased from one of a hundred retail providers. The supposed benefits of competition haven&#x27;t materialized - we&#x27;re paying the same for electricity now as we did when all electricity was a single regulated monopoly on an inflation-adjusted basis, only now no private investor will pony up for capital investment projects so we keep building cheap crappy power plants. Otherwise it&#x27;s the same as before and it seems to function fairly well.<p>Either of these would be a huge improvement and exactly what the government is best at - handling public infrastructure that is ill-suited to competition or forms a natural monopoly.<p>In fact I&#x27;m suffering from Verizon&#x27;s &quot;innovation&quot; right now thanks to their refusal to upgrade peering links. They&#x27;re &quot;innovating&quot; ways to choke traffic to seek rent/extract money on my private transactions with Netflix, Crunchyroll, and others, despite the fact that I am already paying them for use of their network (and they used my private property to lay lines to the rest of the neighborhood - something for which I am not compensated).<p>I do not have any choices; my neighborhood has congested capped cable from TW or Verizon&#x27;s artificially congested FIOS. That&#x27;s it.<p>Frankly when Ma Bell/ATT was broken up I firmly believe it was done in a way to serve ATT&#x27;s long-interests by keeping the retail and lines in the same ILEC box. It let the (D) government appear to be &quot;doing something&quot;, right up until the (R)s proceeded to never meet a merger they didn&#x27;t like.<p>What we need to to break apart Verizon and ATT and turn the physical plant into a regulated delivery company (DeliveryCo) charged with running fiber to the 90% of reasonably-reachable homes in the USA. That physical infrastructure should serve us for at least 100 years - we know how to send 10Gbps/100Gbps and more down the line and the expensive part is digging up yards/streets; the boxes on either end are a pittance by comparison. I suspect it would actually serve us for 1000 years or more but it&#x27;s The Future so who knows.<p>Let anyone who wants to start an ISP do so; DeliveryCo just drops the ISP fiber/ethernet cables at whatever datacenter you like in your city and they&#x27;re responsible for backhaul/transit, billing, customer service, packages, etc. Let DeliveryCo be effectively transparent with VLANs or IP/IP encapsulation so as far as my router and my ISP&#x27;s router are concerned DeliveryCo doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>People can claim it doesn&#x27;t work, but the regulators seem perfectly capable of demanding 60hz+/-@120V AC be reliably delivered to every home with guaranteed response/repair times (except in cases of emergencies). When my underground cable gave out and started arcing with the dirt they answered the phone and sent a truck within 2 hours and it was repaired within 5. If DeliveryCo&#x27;s regulator said they had to deliver 1Gbps links I don&#x27;t see why it would differ.",1405982307

I strongly believe that he can do whatever he puts his mind to - he&#x27;s really smart and have the necessary curiosity and persistence, but also some more difficult-to-define ways of thinking and personality traits (despite his young age) that I recognize mostly from the best hackers I&#x27;ve met. The Force is strong with this one.<p>Today, while visiting SF with his family, he finally asked me for help to get started. He even told me that he wants to become the best computer geek in his class (I love that it&#x27;s becoming cool to be a nerd, and wish it was like that when I was in third grade :)). Being 8 years old he&#x27;s of course very interested in mobile apps and games, but I don&#x27;t have much experience with either kids or building mobile apps/games. Still, I want to give him the best advice possible so I figured I&#x27;d ask you guys:<p>* How do you start coding and building apps when you&#x27;re 8 years old?<p>* Are there tutorials/getting started guides that are particularly suitable for kids?<p>* Anything else he or his parents should know?<p>Ideally he&#x27;d be able to build something cool relatively quickly without understanding everything. He can always dive into the details when he know how things tie together at a high level, but it&#x27;s probably important that the learning process is rewarding and fun all thew ay. At least that worked for me and now I get off over low-level stuff and algorithms on a daily basis.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for help and recommendations particularly from people who have (or just understand) kids, or have otherwise guided a young aspiring hacker onto the path of true awesomeness.

Someone should write a primer on money transfers and cryptocurrencies (someone with better answers than my best guess, included below.)<p>My hunch is that the trust required to move money is very similar to the trust required to have an account with money at your bank, but the main difference is you pay for that trust in different ways.<p>If you write a remittance, you trust it will be remotely delivered upon request (ie, immediately). That trust is ensured by an organization that has access to ready capital in many locations (which involves some opportunity cost, Western Union could just be pooling all that money and investing it). You pay for that trust through fees.<p>When you deposit money at a bank, you trust that they will return it to you at any of their branches at some point in the future. That&#x27;s a very similar sort of trust. Yet here, you really pay for it by foregoing the opportunity cost of lending your money to strangers. Though they pool your money with the money of others to smooth risk, so they&#x27;re getting a better return / less risky return from lending than you could get on your own. But you&#x27;re really paying through the difference between the return you would earn by loaning it out and the interest you earn. You&#x27;re paying that gap.<p>Similar problems occur in domestic money transfers, so domestic money transfers still have fees. However, I would expect that establishing trust with international money transfers involves dealing with multiple currencies (possibly some of which are being inflated by a government), magnifying the costs. I would expect the fees would tend to be higher.<p>(Western Union doesn&#x27;t suggest this is the case. Sending $1000 instantly seems to bounce between $86 and $95 no matter where I send it, domestic or international. They may be making some money by setting exchange rates, I&#x27;m not sure. Also, they sometimes gave me wildly outlier fee quotes, so I&#x27;m not sure those are their actual prices, or how stable they are, or if there&#x27;s not a bug in the website. For comparison, World Bank says remittances average around 8.14%: <a href=""http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en</a> )<p>Banks often charge more for international wire transfers, but weirdly tend not to change their prices based on the amount sent. Here&#x27;s a chart of some of their fees: <a href=""http://www.mybanktracker.com/news/2013/04/18/wire-transfer-fees-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mybanktracker.com/news/2013/04/18/wire-transfer-f...</a><p>Bitcoin offers some opportunities to bypass some of the required trust, possibly resulting in drastically lower fees. (You still have to trust the network won&#x27;t implode though.) That said, I don&#x27;t want to suggest remittance services are gouging anyone. I have no doubt it&#x27;s costly to set up an international trust network with cash on hand all around the world. But I think there&#x27;s an argument to be made that the infrastructure for a cryptocurrency scales a bit more easily than the infrastructure for a Western Union. (On the other hand, ensuring there are buyers and sellers of bitcoin in whatever two cities you&#x27;re using as endpoints isn&#x27;t trivial either.)<p>That World Bank link above talks about the &quot;5x5&quot; goal of reducing remittance fees by 5% (from 10%) over 5 years (beginning in 2010). Work anywhere in the developing world or on development economics and you&#x27;ll get a sense of how critical remittances are to developing economies (often swamping the impact of foreign aid). It&#x27;s conceivable that many humanitarian and development goals might be hit if we could use technology to lower barriers to easier money transfers.",1405981547

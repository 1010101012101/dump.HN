4980251,comment,4977675,4977675,2,0,Tonysr,,,"Gentlemen, this is about the nature of selling. First the word incorrectly infers something you do to other folks over which they have little control, providing that you select the proper words which magically enables that amazing feat to occur. Allowing you to simply charm them into giving you money for your wares. Pure BS as any thinking person can readily see.<p>The fact of the matter is, the customer has all of the power to decide and to pay. Your job as a salesman, is to avoid cluttering the offer with unnecessary information which can slow down or stop the person from making a decision to purchase your wares. That is exactly what Benjamin Franklin learned to do, in the little parable.<p>He simply made himself the messenger from a group of intelligent folks, who were in fact offering the services, which would create a desirable effect for them, which the subscribers then decided was to their benefit.<p>I might add that the offer would be defined as a win-win in present day terms. Personally, I might also add that it is really a win win win, since society as a whole I believe benefits from a more  enlightened society.<p>Salesmanship has taken a bad rap from those who misunderstand the facts. You see ... sell'in ain't tell'in it's ask'in. ....",1356738818

I'm just over 60% through the book so I don't want to give it a ringing endorsement just yet but it fits the category of  ""developing a new superpower"" quite nicely and it's definitely worth a particular mention on HN for two reasons.<p>1. Ferriss, the author, is very much a hacker in his approach to trying new things and drawing conclusions. This is also very evident in his previous book, The 4-Hour Body.<p>2. The 4-Hour Chef not only teaches the reader how to cook (which is a superpower in itself). He also delves into the _meta_ and spends a large portion of the book, discussing the framework he uses for learning these techniques and how he has applied it to learning (and excelling in) other skill sets like judo, tango dancing and learning new languages.<p>Edit: This sounds like a bit of a marketing message, which it definitely is not, so I'll add a negative.<p>I find his books to be a bit scattered and although they're centered on an over-arching theme he doesn't always tie the threads together very convincingly. Whole chapters can seem like lightly-edited crib notes. Personally, I don't mind this style of writing and it does make his books very easy to scan and skip chapters without losing the books narrative but at times I've also found it difficult to follow.",1356738803

4980199,comment,4979968,4979968,3,0,trevelyan,,,"It's a brilliant film, but it really isn't open-ended to anyone who has read A Tale of Two Cities. In Dicken's book, the sacrificial death of scoundrel Sydney Carton ""recalls to life"" his aristocratic double Charles Darney. And then as Carton walks to the guillotine we share his vision of a post-revolutionary France that has moved past destructive class conflict and emerged ""peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy."" Ergo Carton's line that ""it is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.""<p>Resolving the ambiguity of the ending is the entire point of this extended allusion. We have the sacrifice of a negative character (Batman) redeeming his positive aristocratic double (Wayne), and then general images of social redemption (even down to the visuals of children returning to the garden) as Gotham moves beyond the political/economic oppression that the film claims has thematically resulted from Batman's vigilante behavior and his refusal to trust in the norms of democratic society.<p>A great movie and widely misunderstood! And very suitable for the HN crowd given that it operates as an extended critique of the American war on terror.

Demurrage on it's own doesn't operate very differently than the mildly inflationary currencies used in the real world (dollars, euros, etc.).  Freicoin on the other hand is promising all sorts of other things.<p>[1] Quoting at length from:<p><a href=""http://bionicmosquito.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/more-on-worgl-velocity-of-money.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bionicmosquito.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/more-on-worgl-v...</a><p>""<i>So, would this be sustainable?  If not, why not?<p>I believe the activity would not have been sustainable.  I believe that once the taxes in arrears were completely paid and once the people paid in advance to the degree they felt sufficient (one year in advance?  Five years in advance?  I dont know, but at some point they would stop), the scrip would lose a key part of its attractiveness.<p>One way a government can ensure the demand for its currency is to demand (or accept) that taxes are paid in the subject currency.  The other way is through monopoly legal tender laws.  Wrgl obviously could not legislate or enforce monopoly legal tender, so the demand for the scrip could certainly be attributed to the need to pay taxes.<p>The demand could certainly not be attributed to the demurrage  not when there was the national schilling available  paying interest, and at a one-for-one exchange (setting aside the conversion fee).<p>Once this tax need was satisfied, what would happen to the desirability of a depreciating-value scrip vs. currency that did not come with a 1% monthly penalty?  The answer to me is clear, not that we have to agree.  I suspect the depreciating scrip would begin trading at a discount, and sooner than later would be regularly returned to the bank for the national currency, even with the 2% loss.  Two percent might be too big a loss when one owes taxes and can satisfy these taxes with the depreciating scrip at full face value.  However, when there is no benefit to holding a depreciating currency to the national one, I suspect many would eat the one-time 2% charge to avoid paying the recurring 1% charge.<p>In my opinion, this is exactly the situation that was immediately in front of Wrgl when the national government put an end to the experiment.  Depending on which estimate of taxes in arrears used (see the discrepancy as pointed out in my first article), within one month, but not more than six, all taxes in arrears would have been paid.  At that point, I suspect demand for the scrip would have fallen  resulting in the exchange for national currency that I described above.""</i>",1356737133

In fact, the main impact of the 2008 FISA bill was to explicitly specify collection and oversight standards for targeting non US persons communicating over US systems.

I still think ubiquitous computing can dramatically improve our quality of life, but I don't think it'll happen through heads up displays and chording keyboards.<p>This PDF of a presentation I gave in May touches on it a little: <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/vitorio/Automated%20Storytelling%20May%202012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.amazonaws.com/vitorio/Automated%20Storytelling%20M...</a><p>Google Glass is being designed by the same people that I ranted against in 2006.  There's a very humane, social, intimate aspect it's lacked so far, with the exception of one photograph, which Robin Sloan talks about here:<p><a href=""http://www.robinsloan.com/note/pictures-and-vision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robinsloan.com/note/pictures-and-vision/</a><p>Everything about Google Glass is fraught with legal peril, because videotaping and audio recording laws and wiretapping laws and personal privacy laws are different from state to state.  I've discussed this before, here, too: academics stick to still photos for this reason, unless it's their own family inside their own house (Deb Roy) or for military use.<p>I continue to believe that wearable computing, ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, ambient information, quiet computing, lifelogging, quantified self, internet of things, natural interfaces, immersive i/o, etc., are all facets of the same ""next step"" in technology, and that ""storytelling"" is the way it will make sense to us, and we will make sense of it.  Normal people don't want a bar graph; they want to know they did a good job today, and they're definitely making progress toward their goal, and if they get off the computer and leave in the next two minutes they'll beat traffic and have time to pick up flowers for their wife on their way home.  And it will be a million sensors and real-time 24/7 video and audio recording and teraflops of traffic prediction and monitoring of your wife's mood, and all you will know -- all that will <i>matter</i> -- is that you two haven't fought in three years and she thinks you are just so thoughtful.",1356736084

It goes way beyond what one would normally call a ""legacy system"".<p>You can't record the position of trains because there is no way to snapshot the whole system. Only the signal tower local to that section of the system is aware of what's going on in its zone. This is a vestige of the design where there was no reasonable way to centralize that amount of signaling over such great distances.<p>To get a snapshot of the whole system you'd have to simultaneously snapshot the state of every signal tower in the system and find some way to collect this information centrally. This sounds reasonable until you realize that the control system, being 50 years pre-computer, is unaware of individual trains. It doesn't detect trains, only presence of at least one car on a section of track (detected by the third rail making contact with the train).<p>To ascertain which train is where you'd have to either have dispatchers identify the train by communicating with operators (hard to poll), or infer the identity of a train by monitoring state. Both are quite difficult when all of your data is spread all over the entirety of NYC in isolated distributed control centers.<p>The IRT trains spent billions centralizing all command and control into a single building in Manhattan, and thus snapshotting state is trivially easy. The BMT/IND segments of the system are substantially bigger, with more stations, than even that. A full modernization to electronic control is necessary, which will cost many billions.",1356735832

Even going back into the ocean like the dolphins is more practical than <i>that</i>.<p>And more importantly, I think there is a difference between justified authority and power. Not that I&#x27;m automatically accepting employer and employee relationships as desirable, just like with &quot;citizen vs. politician&quot;, but for example it&#x27;s perfectly okay that parents can yank their kids at the arm when those are about to run into traffic, and otherwise curtail their autonomy, as long as it&#x27;s justified. That&#x27;s not power, that&#x27;s authority, and even authority needs to be constantly re-evaluated and justified.<p>If you&#x27;re on an expedition and the most experienced person leads it, one would expect that when they get sick, they would pass that job on without any fuss at all, since it&#x27;s about the well-being of the expedition, not about their personal power, right? Notice how in many cases instead we have people asserting ownership, certainly when it comes to employers, and even in politics. When was the last time you strolled into a place and up to the manager/president, proved you&#x27;re smarter in all ways, and successfully convinced them they should give you their job and work under you? Thought so :P",1376143133

Can you use CPS in Scala?<p>I see now that Scala can encode GADTs in case classes. What mechanism is available to encode polymorphic variants?

I also subscribe to a couple of podcasts such as &#x27;Security Now&#x27;[4] etc etc.<p>The obvious choices are things like GUI wrappers for CLI tools. ack, nmap, snort etc etc.<p>At the other end would be something like a new secure email protocol. Whilst far more interesting (imo) than a wrapper or fuzzer this maybe be more than I can achieve in the time available.<p>Ideally it needs to be somewhere in between. Interesting, useful but also achievable in the time allowance of 6-7 months a long side a well documented report and other modules.<p>If the idea can adapt i.e. features can be added/dropped depending on how the project is progressing that would be extremely useful as it provides some breathing room on either side.<p>I would really like to hear from Forensic/Security/Network professionals especially about tools they would actually find useful in their fields and any suggestions would be appreciated.<p>Also just general useful suggestions, links to web resources/podcasts/books etc that could be useful for inspiration are welcome.<p>[1] http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/tangled/

Not. &quot;All encrption done by the providers.&quot; says it all. It&#x27;s a farce.<p>And I have to agree to some people in this thread, that germany IT engineering lacks behind a lot. Either our tech education is as bad as I think it is, or I don&#x27;t know what. But this whole de-mail thing started as an initiative by the postal service to develop a &quot;e-post-brief&quot; aiming to be an official/secure/non-deniable electronic postal service. Which is ridiculous.<p>I think the technical right thing to do (safe, anonymous communication) is just not what any state would want. It doesn&#x27;t help consumerism and it doesn&#x27;t protect the ruling social norms so why would a state fund it?",1376139837

They may even get back to that situation eventually through legal challenges against the supra-legal shit going on.<p>The rest of us, well, we were always subject to this oversight and it won&#x27;t change. We just didn&#x27;t have our noses rubbed in it very often and US media don&#x27;t give a damn. I expect Chinese companies are just as paranoid about data flowing through the US as the US are about their data being in China.<p>It&#x27;s a timely reminder for us all.

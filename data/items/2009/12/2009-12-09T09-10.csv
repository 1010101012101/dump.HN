985591,comment,985530,985549,0,0,dkersten,,,"The USSRians made some decisions which, in retrospect, seem pretty evil. For example, I hear they were cloud seeding to force the fallout to be rained. This hit Belarus very badly. BUT if they hadn't done this, then the clouds would have continued towards Moscow and many many many more people could have been affected. The one thing I do criticize them on, though, is not evacuating people earlier. I also hear they never told anyone the extent of the accident until many days later, when they were already poisoned by radiation.<p>As for the actual accident - there were many factors at play here, including miscommunication between the day and night shift people, untrained staff, bad reactor design etc etc.<p>I just hope people learned from the accident and we can prevent this from happening again.",1260352097
985590,comment,984957,984957,0,0,liquidcool,,,"The pair programming idea got me thinking - what about hiring someone for half days doing your typing for you? This seems economical, esp. in this economy. Maybe a local CS student who would see this as an internship, or at least know the syntax well enough to make your dictation efficient. Since you have your own business you'd just treat it as an expense.<p>I think the speech to text suggestion is also worth investigating.<p>Since you've tried a bunch of things, I assume you've read up on ergonomics. A previous employer forced me to take an ergonomics evaluation when I wanted  a new chair. I thought it was going to be a waste, but it was really useful and helped me improve my home office setup as well.",1260352082
985589,comment,983915,984000,0,0,stingraycharles,,,"I would like to thank everyone for the kind replies and helpful advice -- they're much appreciated and perhaps unsurprisingly, very accurate. Most of it is exactly what I needed to hear. Escaping from other issues in my life is definitely something that has been going on: it's easy to fill a certain emptiness in your life with work. It's harder to actually realize that and do something about it.<p>Right now it all comes down to changing perspective: take distance from work and realize it's far from everything. I might even enjoy it again if I do. And the Christmas season is probably a good time to call a few lost friends.<p>Once again, thanks for all the kind replies. This hacker is just going through a rough time, but will definitely come out stronger. It just sucks when you're in the middle of it. :-)",1260351803

I've heard stories about rural Chinese girls being scammed and promised offers of marriage from rich men in the city.

(Baby boomers should be worried about this.)<p>These are bitter pills to swallow.<p>Chinese social planners are not fools. They know very well that it is better for their excess males to die in battle (and win boons for the country) than for those males to be cooped up in the interior where they will inevitably cause strife.<p>Even with the most massive pacification campaign in history, that glut of childless-males is guaranteed to cause massive social unrest.<p>If anything could conquer Asia and India, it would be a gigantic excess of childless males in an authoritarian society. Alexander the Great would have never dreamed of such a perfect country to conquer with.",1260350870
985580,comment,981606,981606,0,0,codahale,,,"I want to be excited about this, but there are big gaps in this spec.<p>For example, ""blah""[0] should return an Object instance which represents ""b"". Could be a Fixnum. Could be a String. Could be a JPEG of some ASCII art representing the essence of ""B."" Any of those responses would be valid according to RubySpec.<p>What happens when you shadow a local variable with a block variable is unspecified, too. In 1.8.x, it overwrites the variable. In 1.9, it doesn't.<p>Even with a ""RubySpec-compatible"" implementation, you have no way of knowing if your application will run or not, which kind of defeats the purpose.",1260350844

985575,comment,985230,985230,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"It's impressive what you have built, however I wonder about the market you are in.<p>My perception was that the art market has two main categories:<p>a) Original art (no prints or reproductions), which is sometimes bought as an investment or by people who think they are art experts and can buy something unique from and up and coming young artist. It's not just a market, it's a community with its own reputation mechanisms and fashions.  Nothing coming from that direction is ever being sold for $75 online.<p>b) Mass prints of stuff to decorate rooms.<p>It seems to me that you are trying to invent a new market. But it may be that I'm just not sufficiently familiar with the art scene.<p>In any event, I wish you luck and congrats to your high quality website.",1260350615
985573,comment,984930,985446,0,0,forensic,,,">The second you give women the opportunity to work instead of raise a pack of squalling children, they seem to prefer work.<p>Debatable. Women in the West were forced into work due to declining wages. A single income was no longer enough to support a family, and as more women went to work the other families would bid up the price of goods.<p>Are women choosing to work or doing it out of necessity and social pressure?",1260350351
985571,comment,984930,984930,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The author is missing a crucial point. Any decline in working population has to be offset against productivity growth. Otherwise it means very little for overall wealth and for the ability of a society to replace traditional family based social security with a formal rights based social security system.<p>In my view, the potential for productivity growth in a country like China is enormous. Knowledge and skills and capital, it's all there, but it is still advantageous in many cases to use manual labour instead. With rising wages and a shortage of labour this equation will change dramatically and productivity will skyrocket.",1260349735

985568,comment,985479,985545,0,0,senko,,,"Deltas (ie. patches you apply on top of upstream release when making a package) are not forks. Sane distros do that instead of forking for most packages if they have to change anything. Also, most package maintainers know the smaller the delta the less work they have to do, so it's in their own interest to minimise the changes (or try to push changes upstream). (Note: I'm not a Fedora user so can't say whether Fedora, referred to in the article, belongs in that group)<p>OTOH, code dumps of forked projects containing a mix of upstream and modified code without clear indication which code was pulled and which added/modified are a nightmare to work with.<p>[EDIT: not to say Google doesn't, as in the submitted article it's clear that they're trying.]",1260349387

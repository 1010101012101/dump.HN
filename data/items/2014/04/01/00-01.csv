I just feel that this CEO appt does not match that.</i><p>Directly following that is <i>&quot;In a post on his blog, Eich writes, “I am committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, economic status, or religion”</i>. Whatever his current personal beliefs, he has pledged that Mozilla will be that environment. At this point he is actually doing what the detractors are asking of him: making a positive contribution to counter a previous negative one.<p>Your second link on distress has <i>At every turn, I have been heartened by the degree of passion and care that have been apparent as colleague after colleague steps forward to express nuanced opinions, and by the commitment to equality and fairness that runs through the group like the stitches in the binding of a book.</i> and <i>And as much as I’d rather not see a boycott of everything Mozilla does (which, it seems, most people still think of as “Firefox”) based on the actions of a single person affiliated with the organization, I am completely psyched to see this many people this angry in defense of civil rights.</i><p>These are people annoyed with a CEO, but who are very positive about Mozilla&#x27;s culture. They are nuanced opinions that aren&#x27;t the oversimplified &quot;crucify the company because the new CEO made a donation half a decade ago&quot;. They take pains to separate the private behaviour of the CEO and the culture of Mozilla.<p>Those links are saying the same thing my link did: Not particularly happy with the personal beliefs of the CEO, but very happy with the environment at Mozilla. It&#x27;s the knee-jerk politics that talks of the ascendence of the new CEO being matched up with a new culture at Mozilla where gays are oppressed by jackboots. I&#x27;ve worked in places before where the CEO was not looked on kindly by the staff, yet we still did good things.<p>Regarding healthcare in the US, I&#x27;m not too familiar with it, but different workplaces have different levels and coverage of healthcare, and healthcare is a significant perk of a job. When our Australian company first reached out to make an SF office, our recruiters were initially puzzled at the importance that the locals put on healthcare as part of their remuneration package. Healthcare is another fiery topic though, and best left to a different thread :)",1396313918

The micro-motivations of individuals doing this sort of work can be all over the map from person to person.<p>But as someone who very occasionally does such things (but isn&#x27;t looking to &quot;make a name&quot; for myself as a security researcher, which is often a motivation):<p>1) The initial motivation isn&#x27;t so much about documenting security flaws, but finding them in the first place.  It is a very hands-on immediate-results-oriented type of problem solving where you look at a system that is intended (or should be intended, based on what it is doing) to be secure and find ways in which the security is lacking.<p>2) From there, informing the company is just about being a decent net citizen.  If you can work around their security from the outside, other (potentially more nefarious) people can too, and in most cases the company simply doesn&#x27;t realize they have a security problem, so informing them is good for everyone.<p>3) From there, if they refuse to fix the problem and it is very legitimately a security issue, responsible full disclosure (with a solid window of not talking about the bug publically, I go with Google&#x27;s 60-day window as a guideline) is about being a decent net citizen toward the product&#x27;s users (if not the product&#x27;s company).  If they have gaping security flaws in their product that they won&#x27;t fix, users who could and likely will get screwed by them deserve to know so they can make an informed decision as to whether the company they are using is adequately protecting their interests.<p>But as I said, everyone is different, for some people they are mostly resume building a collection of public CVEs on their way to a security research position, for me it is just a fun very occasional hobby and I&#x27;ve not publicly disclosed a gaping security flaw since the mid-1990s because most companies will do the right thing in fixing real security issues if poked a bit these days.",1396311286

Behind the desire is a desire for a  cessation of anxiety or insecurity, e.g., if I become rich, then I want to travel the world.<p>However the paradox, IMHO is that limitation is freedom, pain is joy. There is no bigger prison than having unstructured and unlimited amount of free time and capital. Personally, if it was up to me, I&#x27;d just wither away while playing Dota2, snort cocaine and numb myself with a personal harem of courtesans - which is just a dramatic device for what people in Western society do to &quot;take the edge off&quot; everyday.<p>Without pain, we can&#x27;t appreciate joy. The desire to escape pain and anxiety numbs our entire existence. I&#x27;d weave a self-narrative to &quot;redeem&quot; myself at the end of the tunnel, at 15 I&#x27;d become the next Kurt Cobain, at 18 the next Great American Writer, at 21 the next Mark Zuckerburg, at 25 the next AirBnB &#x27;Software is Eating the Traditional World&#x27; entrepreneur, 27 the next Enterprise Software entrepreneur, 35 the next technical architect at a respectable software company, 40 the next C-level executive and amassing sizable personal fortune (all the time scaling in my personal and social relationships, of course).<p>It is more liberating IMHO to accept my mediocrity and limitations. Than adding more layers of self delusion materialistic or intellectual or moral to get further stuck and perpetuate more lies. There is sometimes more joy and self-acceptance in a condemned man than a man condemned to the routines of capitalism. Not that kind of &#x27;navel-gazing&#x27; self-denial seen in Western Zen monasteries, but the man on death row has finally ceased the struggle due to the gravity and starts to live.<p>The years pass by and the day is forever.

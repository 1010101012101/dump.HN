2633656,comment,2632971,2633420,3,0,geebee,,,"""It's especially hard to affect UX when developers are typically given requirments from someone who has a specific (bad) design in mind.""<p>I agree, but that's because I think it's hard to write good software when developers are typically <i>given</i> requirements but aren't a part of creating those requirements.  The best scenario is when developers are engaged with the users and actively participating in design.  While this approach has gained a lot of credibility over the last few years, especially with the advent of the ""developer-driven culture"", there are still plenty of projects and groups that want to treat development as the ""construction"" phase of a project, something that happens after design and, perhaps these days, ""UX"".<p>As a developer, this has been my big worry about ""UX"" so far.  It seems like it could turn out to be another version of ""coders know how to code - but <i>UX designers</i> know what software really ought to be, so we'll design it, and when we're done we'll let you know what to code up in your cubicle.  Oh, and could we have some work estimates?  Thanks!""<p>I want to be sure I recognize that developers have their own version of this.  ""I'll write up the software, but it'll have a crappy UI.  Here, designer, pretty this up for me would ya?  Should take you about a day, right?""<p>I liked the 37signals notion of the ""three musketeers"" (<a href=""http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_The_Three_Musketeers.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_The_Three_Musketeers.p...</a>), a developer, designer, and ""sweeper"" who can play both roles.  All three work very closely together in a project.<p>I think UX is a great idea and could be an important park of a development project, but I'd recommend UX advocates start thinking about how it would fit into a small team (no more than three people).  You really don't have room on these teams for people who don't contribute directly to the working software application.  As ThomPete pointed out, this means you can't afford staff who work in abstractions.<p>I'd see this as a skill set that people in design or development roles should strive to obtain.  If you mainly do design, wireframes, or front end work, see what you can learn from UX.  Same for back end development - sometimes projects do start with very simple UI and focus on application functionality, so it could be hugely helpful to consider the context of UX.<p>As others have pointed out, this is also something you can invest in, because you get a tangible product.",1307548715

With that said, when I was in school we regularly covered a thousand years in a single page.  And in many cases complete eras as pertained to geography were skipped altogether.  To this day I don't think I could tell you the name of a single African King pre-1900.<p>With that said, one of the things I still prefer about Khan's lectures, even abbreviated ones like these stated, is that I can pause them at any time, and look up the Japanese oil embargo.  And start right back up where I left off in the video.  With live lectures at best you can take a note of it, and look it up later, but then other facts that build upon this in the lecture are missed -- and you may not even know that you missed them.",1307548655

We have been traveling and I've gotten phone calls from them within 5 minutes of a transaction saying, ""hey, we just want to make sure this is legit.""<p>The fact that they ignored the alarms is important and I agree, negligent.

Although that's certainly understandable given you believe that's the entire point of our existence.<p>For those of us who don't believe there is some transcendent being out there waiting to either embrace us or condemn us to eternal suffering in the afterlife, this is all we've got.  We don't have faith that our good deeds and beliefs will rewarded or punished.  We don't have faith that there is some larger purpose to life than what actually happens on this planet.<p>Instead, we try to build societies so that we can place faith in people, and ideas.  Is that goal any less noble because the universe will at one point, billions of years in the future, turn into a cold, dead cinder?<p>Nobody, except those who commit great harm, will be remembered even 100 years from now.  Some people might know the name Bill Gates in 2111, but most people will have forgotten what he actually accomplished, just as most of our generation has forgotten what Rockefeller, or Carnegie, or Vanderbilt did.

I think this aspect of the original critic's article displayed his lack of understanding of an incremental and iterative approach. If we waited until he had completed every lecture on history, we'd never have any.  Given the current state, and even considering the future state, it is nonsensical to judge it on the basis of being the ""sole source"" of information on a subject.<p>The second bad assumption is that Khan's work is somehow inferior to other high school teachers' presentations of the subject. In my experience, at a high school frequently referred to as the best in the US, we barely even made it through the Vietnam war, and the ""mental model"" presented was merely a random collection of facts.<p>If only this author could see the average high school history teacher in action, he would be demanding that they stop teaching kids to glue garbage on a piece of poster board and teach his version of the subject.  The difference with Khan is that it's all out there. He's open for review, and the videos can be improved.",1307548053

However, if you decide to keep living like now, and you do not wish to use that money for the moment, I suggest you put it in an investment (such as bonds) were you cannot easily withdraw the money. This is because otherwise you would be quickly tempted to use the money for your daily problems you would normally solve otherwise. So if you want to continue living like you did before, make sure the money is frozen or something but still invested so it doesn't use it's value over time (inflation). 
To make your decision, you should look into the options. First, do a lot, I mean really a lot of research on founding a startup. How much work is it? What will your life look like when you have a startup? Which things will you miss that you have now? Write down some pro's and con's.<p>My perspective is that you do want to continue living like you live now. If you are happy with your job, stay there for now, because it is not easy to find a good job. Also you can get a lot of xp and grow. You can have oppurtunities like you say and you will make a carrier. Something to be proud of. When you outgrow that job, you can think of your own business.<p>Of course I want to suggest to you to help me carry the burden and give me some of that large amount. It would be a nice reward for this advice, but I do not want anything in return for this, I give it to you unconditionally. However I do find myself in need of 2,500 to pursue my own dream. I do have a dream, and it is now that I have the chance to make it real. That is because now I do have time and I'm young, if I wait to long, I will end up in this society witouth any prospects and live a normal live. So if you are open to investing in someone's dream, please feel free to do so. I know this is what I want deep in side and will make me happy. Donation can be done on this adress: 1Q5JMqpGcGo7cz7eqrhuivyLsSCzTY9CQ5

No compiler warnings are generated (nor should the be). What do you mean by defined method types? It is simply looking for any selector which matches on any class because there is not enough statically available information to know any different. Messages are always passed dynamically.<p>Are we talking about Objective-C? Are you familiar with NSInvocation? Or performSelector:, performSelector:withObject:, performSelector:withObject:withObject:? Or NSNotificationCenter's addObserver:selector:name:object:? This is all done at runtime. No special type information is available to the compiler when using these. Objective-C messagse are always sent dynamically, so the only ABI concerns are how the stack is prepared, and not the interface of the class of an object. You can define methods and swap them out at runtime, this feature would be useless if everything had to be known at compile time.<p>ARC needs to know that the types of Objective-C objects, id still works fine, beyond that it needs to know no other type information from what I can tell.<p>It seems we are talking past each other.

If we're serious about fighting for an efficient education system, we must be prepared to answer objections like this.<p>He brings up a few valid points that I haven't thought of before. Presumably, as systems like KA are adopted the <i>amount</i> of total educational material decreases, as individual curricula are replaced by a standard set of materials.

Given that, and the unimpressive mileage, the prime advantage to driving a Smart car is that you have many more parking options, which can be really nice when you're in a city.<p>Having said all that, I get what this guy's saying in a way. We recently bought a Dodge Magnum (For a roadtrip across the US next year). All my life I've driven compact cars. The Elantra always seemed like plenty of car to me. I could sit four comfortably (five less so), I can fit a drum kit, a guitar amp and cab, and still have someone in the passenger seat, and it was still larger on the inside than a Civic or a Jetta.<p>After driving the Magnum for a month or two, I had to switch it up and drive the Elantra, and I was struck by how claustrophobic the car felt. It never seemed like a compact car to me, but after driving around in a car whose title is Latin for ""big"", the Elantra definitely felt compact now. My idea of what 'normal' was very definitely shifted. (It's still a great car, ten years on.)",1307545942

You can find disavantages in every programming language, but are the advantages which drive the choice.<p>You can also squeeze java a lot, running in less then 16MB.

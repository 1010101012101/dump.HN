4869847,comment,4867577,4869116,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This sort of thing is a natural consequence of high cost and high risk missions. You have a multi-billion dollar mission, and it's doing something unprecedented and using a brand new design and construction. When you build something like that what tends to happen is that you try to keep the mission scope reasonable and then you build the vehicle to have a very high (say >95%) chance of satisfying that minimum mission requirement. But what happens when, say, you create a Mars rover with a 95% chance of working for 90 days you'll likely end up engineering a vehicle which might have, say, a 50% chance of lasting for 5 years. If you set out to do that from the start it would be a non-starter, because a 50% mission success rate is too low for a multi-billion dollar mission.",1354604291

There are numerous benefits (and draw-backs) to going to such schools but to make broad assessments about individuals who attended the schools is asinine, like any other stereotype.<p>Essentially the argument here is that ivy-leaguers have better options when leaving college so, all things being equal, with an ivy-leaguer and a lower-tier school alum in the same job you'd expect the ivy-leaguer to be less skilled.<p>The point that is neglected is that the screening process for top-tier schools is substantially more difficult, so much so that it is feasible to see a student from the lowest quartile of the student body at a top-tier school that would have performed in the highest quartile at a less rigorous school. (note: less rigorous is not meant to be a comment on educational quality, only a comment on the intensity of the academic assignments).  In this context it's unclear to me why the above comment makes sense.

4869825,comment,4868793,4868793,2,0,ryanmolden,,,"This is definitely interesting (though the formal language talk in the beginning is mostly over my head). On one hand it makes a lot of sense to have the compilers being doing the transforms to achieve safe parralellism, as opposed to what we have now days with devs in charge, which is mostly ""we think we found all the threading bugs"" parrallelism. On the other hand large swathes of a lot of apps are likely fairly sequential in nature. Obviously things like disk and network I/O or massive vector processing can and should be moved of the primary thread, on the other hand I wonder if most apps would just end up with a huge chain of tasks all still, more or less, serial in nature. And then you get the joy of debugging that. Because even if the bugs aren't of a thread safety variety they will still be there, and now you have 50 things happening in parallel that you have to ignore (assuming the compiler produced threading itself has no bugs, it's turtles all the way down!)",1354603676

There will always be a percentage of customers that expect more than the norm (for good or not so good reasons). The company cannot treat everyone's opinion the same, as they'd then need to design a product and customer support that makes the most picky person happy - which would be nice for all customers but very costly.<p>In the end, the company has to decide where they put the bar for ""good customer support"", from ""making at least 50% happy"" up to ""making 95% happy"" but never ""making 100% happy"".

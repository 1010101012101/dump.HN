The post is full of good advice + quotes from PG and I highly appreciate YC's contributions to the startup ecosystem but people shouldn't think that being part of YC is the only option. People like the OP telling us that they needed six attempts to get in YC send the wrong signal: that YC is the one and only way to get a real entrepreneur. PG created a great brand and yes, it must feel amazing going through YC but it could also mislead young entrepreneurs -- instead of building a great product they focus too much on the application process and potential credentials they might get from YC.

Gravity acts on all objects not fastened to something, and one can get a very good estimate of an object's path in three dimensions if one can compute a velocity profile. Most paths in a gravitational field are curved (the exception is a path aligned with the field).<p>As to velocity, anything that convert kinetic energy into another kind of energy -- light, heat, noise -- causes a reduction in velocity.<p>The two factors above (the effect of gravity and a velocity profile) can be used to produce a very good three-dimensional path through the atmosphere, through many kinds of velocity changes, all the way to the ground.<p>The Russian meteor very clearly underwent a great reduction in velocity when it glowed brighter than the sun, simply because that glow represents energy, and the energy's source was the meteor's mass and velocity, which therefore had to decline. Remember that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed in form. Knowing the amount of energy dissipated by the bright phase, and knowing the meteor's initial mass and velocity, one can write a very good model of the object's evolution from space rock to meteorite (meaning a former meteor on the ground) and its path.",1360985906

And I thought, Thats not actually anything to do with political correctness. Thats just treating other people with respect.</i><p>No, being respectful and being politically correct are very different things.<p>* Respectful would be to say, ""I don't care whether you're a man or a woman, white or black, Jewish or Catholic, I only care that you can code!""<p>* Politically correct makes a manhole cover into a person-hole cover.<p>* Politically correct turned ""dumb"" into ""retarded"", optimistically suggesting hope for a change in the future, and finally into ""developmentally delayed"", the current euphemism. But that isn't about respect, because each new euphemism carries the same meaning as the word it replaces, and people often turn well-intentioned euphemisms into insults, as with ""retard"", the short version of ""retarded"", the usage of which caused ""developmentally delayed"" to replace ""retarded"". Stay tuned for more replacements.<p>* Politically correct turns any number of politically incorrect student descriptions into ""special-needs student"", which, in the name of correctness, undermines any meaningful communication.<p>* A school in Seattle renamed its Easter eggs 'spring spheres' to avoid causing offence to people who did not celebrate Easter. This isn't respect, this is paranoia and overreaction.<p>* A recent zealous effort to replace the engineering terms ""master"" and ""slave"" (used to describe the relationship between storage devices, network elements and other things) has been provisionally abandoned for lack of a meaningful substitute.

Also using the experience to learn something new. I am a c#/java developer so I have experience with j2ee, mvc 4, and even play framework. But I was looking for something thats new/popular.\nI was thinking of using ruby on rails as I have heard some good things. But it seems to be going out of favour/security risks arising. Then I hear all these new things like node.js meteor and the likes. I dont want to use javascript as my server side code. Using it on the client side is enough :D.\nThanks.",1360983679

6157981,comment,6157157,6157812,3,0,dekhn,,,"Generally, the people doing brain simulations like to claim that they can use a massively reduced representation (little more than a graph model that pushes signals around with some constants) and yet, somehow, the simulation is inherently capable of reproducing something complex about thought.  I&#x27;m not sure how they get to this conclusion, but it&#x27;s a massive reductionism.  It would be nice if it were true- it would mean that for a reasonable expenditure, we could build a machine that, basically, &quot;thought&quot; and had a &quot;mind&quot; and we could convince ourselves that it was &quot;living&quot; much like we think of other humans.<p>To date nobody has come up with a really compelling disproof that they are more or less correct- thought and mind seem to be best explained as &quot;emergent behavior of a complex system&quot;.<p>Now, whether can we bootstrap a thinking mind by running complex simulations on computers remains to be seen.

For every comment I read that was outlandish, fallacious and clearly media spoon-fed, I have to say I can recall a thread of people saying, &quot;No, that doesn&#x27;t make sense, you&#x27;re trying to disprove a negative&quot;, etc.<p>tl;dr - My point here is that I think the baseline intelligence of Hacker News is higher than we might think it is just by observing the front page, and that there are actually a lot more savvy people gaming the front page who are just driven by a relative few who act as the passionate, vocal majority.<p>That&#x27;s just my opinion.

They just don&#x27;t have an urge to upvote the things that should be.<p>It&#x27;s exactly why political stories and comments pop up to the top very quickly.

Sure, we&#x27;re all hackers. But a lot of us care about the politics.

Some are involved in network security, some are programmers, some are involved in web design, and some are merely interested in tech news.  Some are them male, some of them are female.<p>Yet, without exception, they have all expressed to me that they think that the site has substantially lowered in quality since the details of PRISM were leaked.<p>I think the fundamental problem is that that story brought in a large influx of new members at once.  This disrupts the &#x27;integration&#x27; process that most older members of this site went through when they first joined.  Any post that was trite or lacked in quality was quickly downvoted, and it become apparent very quickly that this is a site that encourages thoughtful, mature, calm comments.  On the other hand, during an influx of new users, this process is disrupted.  The new users, especially if they share a similar ideology, will upvote each other if they agree with the idea of the post, even if it lacks in quality or is counter-productive to intelligent discourse.  They will then look around the site, and see that similar comments are upvoted across the board, and think that this is acceptable behaviour.<p>There is a lot of anger at these new users, but I do not feel it is their fault, as they are acting as they would on any other forum, and they simply do not understand that they are hurting the site.  I think it is our duty, as older members of this website, to fix this problem.<p>So, what is the solution?  Well, I think that it is clear at this point that sitting back and hoping that the situation will resolve itself is not going to work.  I think that there needs to be a concerted effort between the mods and the users with high karma to discipline new users who do not following proper posting etiquette.  I think that more voting &#x27;power&#x27; should be given to the older users with higher karma.  Giving trusted members of this website more voting power will allow their votes to outweigh the large number of new members, and will allow the trusted members to teach new users what types of posts are acceptable and which types of posts are not.  One of the problems that arises is that users will create uncivil posts that are clearly very partisan in nature, but that will be propped up by people who agree with them.  This is poisonous for the environment of this site and clearly does not encourage useful discourse.  These posts need to be ruthlessly downvoted, and it must be made very apparent to new users that they must be civil, regardless of how many people agree with them.<p>This will allow for a closer adherence to the rules, in particular, &quot;Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they&#x27;re evidence of some interesting <i>new</i> phenomenon&quot;.

But this makes CCITT G3 and G4 lossy.<p>2. It has no defined endianess. This adds another fault risk which you won&#x27;t see coming as long as you&#x27;re working on an isolated platform but can hit you in the nuts when you change hardware or software.<p>3. The data does not contain resolution or dimensional information, as well as no information about endianess
This means that you have to rely on a container providing these informations. It could be TIFF, it could be PDF, it could be something an intern coded during coffee break. This is good on one hand, but evil on the other. Software is sold, saying CCITT G4 compression (a standard, after all) is used, while the data can be embedded in proprietary containers.<p>4. It&#x27;s a 2D compression, meaning the compression is applied on a matrix of binary pixel data. As the standard does not specify the dimensions, you depend on another image container like TIFF to provide information. Because G4 removed EOL markers, there is no way to reconstruct image dimensions from the compressed data alone.<p>5. It&#x27;s not exactly fault tolerant. Transmission errors can influence larger areas of the image up to making the picture totally unreadable. Flipped bits are not too critical, missing bits are, due to the 2D compression.<p>There are many excellent, fault tolerant, standardized Image formats ready to use for document processing and archiving, CCITT G4 isn&#x27;t exactly one of them.",1375666405

But there were plenty of other parents that fought to get their kids a better education and were stymied by a system that simply did not appreciate or care for feedback or parental participation.  So those that could afford it sent their kids to Catholic schools, the only place left in NYC to ensure kids got a decent education.  I was fortunate enough to be one of those kids, but my parents stretched to make the tuition.

These value add tech businesses may see a slow down, but not a collapse.<p>The biggest example that is here to stay is E-Commerce.

Not everyone uses AngularJS/Python/Haskell/etc.",1375664695
6157830,comment,6157451,6157818,1,0,sgarman,,,"I think the real goal with this kind of question is should we be more critical in how we adopt new technologies. Should we think about both positive and negatives effects on culture and society. Right now we essentially have a culture that grabs on to anything new as soon as possible and then deal with the consequences when they arrive. I think this argument is especially potent with the HN crew.",1375664679

The Amish are an interesting people, but thinking that their way of living should be the norm is a romantic response to how society uses technology in the wrong ways. I firmly believe that we can only grow by increasing the technology we use across all walks of life (education, resource management, communication, labour, etc.)",1375664455

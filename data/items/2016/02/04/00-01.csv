Here&#x27;s the current state.<p>F-35A test aircraft AF-02 has completed initial test firings of the internal gun on the F-35A variant, both on the ground [1] and in flight [2]. The F-35B and F-35C carry their gun externally, in a centerline gun pod [3]. The gun pod has been tested over the past several years [4] on the ground, and will be tested on those variants later this year.<p>The 2017 date in that article you posted refers to when the cannon on all variants will be integrated with the mission systems software.<p>So just as it is disingenuous to say &quot;the F-35 cannon testing is complete&quot; it&#x27;s also not completely accurate to say &quot;it doesn&#x27;t have a functioning cannon yet.&quot; The engineering reality is more nuanced than that.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFoJ93Kb5z0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFoJ93Kb5z0</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEAhFZG022M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEAhFZG022M</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://aviationintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20120222_O_GR159_001-copy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aviationintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20120222...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTDomgJooJU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTDomgJooJU</a>",1454547596

While you could technically have two different JVMs installed side-by-side, in practice nobody actually does this because of the operational complexity and the way that Java handles dependencies.  Perhaps this will become an issue for Go if people start using the new shared library feature.  For Java, _everything_ is a shared library (sort of), so this is an omnipresent issue.<p>I think both Go and Java have been good about avoiding backwards incompatible changes in the standard library.  Both languages have an explicit policy of avoiding these whenever it is at all possible.<p>Frankly, the Go standard library is a lot better written than the Java one.  For example, I dare you to figure out how to call statvfs from Java, or figure out how many hardlinks there are to a specific file inode.  Or make an asynchronous DNS lookup.

Sharing makes sense if the owners want to split costs and get year-round use out of it, but if every major sports team in the area can strong-arm its own special-purpose stadium from the local government, then they will.<p>There are exceptions, like sibling comments note.  In LA, the Staples Center is actually shared by 3 teams (2 NBA, 1 NHL) and is also a popular concert venue.

11031010,comment,11025618,11030151,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"While I agree that compaction is desirable in theory, empirically it&#x27;s not really necessary.  For example, there are no C/C++ malloc/free implementations that compact, because compaction would change the address of pointers, breaking the C language.  Long-lived C and C++ applications seem to get by just fine without the ability to move objects in memory.<p>Java code also tends to make more allocations than Go code, simply because Java does not (yet) have value types, and Go does.  This isn&#x27;t really anything to do with the GC, but it does mean that Java _needs_ a more powerful GC just to handle the sometimes much greater volume of allocations.  It also makes Java programmers sometimes have to resort to hacks like arrays of primitive types (I&#x27;ve done this before).<p>People like to talk about how important generational GC is, and how big a problem it is that Go doesn&#x27;t have it.  But I have also seen that if there is too high a volume of data in the young-gen in Java, short-lived objects get tenured anyway.  In practice, the generational assumption isn&#x27;t always true.  If you use libraries like Protobuffers that create a ton of garbage, you can pretty easily exceed the GC&#x27;s ability to keep up with short-lived garbage.<p>I&#x27;m really curious to see how Go&#x27;s GC works out for big heaps in practice.  I can say that my experience with Java heaps above 100 GB has not been good.  (To be fair, most of my Java experience has been under CMS, not the new G1 collector.)",1454544811

11031005,comment,11027319,11030708,0,0,kentonv,,,"> Sending schema over the wire is not a good solution for anything else than point-to-point communication.<p>OK, let&#x27;s back up a moment. I am not entirely sure what &quot;Schema / Class Id&quot; in your table means. Your table claims Protobuf doesn&#x27;t support it, but the text below is unclear on what you think Protobuf doesn&#x27;t support.<p>You frequently use the term &quot;self-describing&quot;, but this could have two meanings:<p>1) Like JSON, where the names of all fields appear in the message, so that a human can read the message easily without external information.<p>2) Limited self-description in which field values can be identified and parsed, but their names are not available (perhaps replaced by numeric tags or indexes).<p>Protobuf can support (1) by including the schema in the payload. I agree this is not commonly useful.<p>Protobuf supports (2) natively, by virtue of being a TLV format (just like ION).<p>Re-reading the page, it sounds like you are assuming the Protobuf format cannot be deciphered at all without the schema, but this simply isn&#x27;t true.<p>If you meant something else, please explain.<p>> The Protobuf documentation says very clearly that you cannot see when one message ends and another begins.<p>I wrote that documentation. It doesn&#x27;t mean what you think (my fault, perhaps). What it&#x27;s saying is that the top-level message is a series of tag-value pairs with no explicit indication of where that series ends (on the assumption that you already know, e.g. based on EOF). Thus, if you concatenate two whole messages without adding any delimiter then it will look like one big message containing all the fields from both. However, each field within the message <i>is</i> clearly delimited and sub-messages are length-delimited therefore skipable.<p>> We have looked at Cap&#x27;n Proto - but late in the process where we had already looked at quite a lot of formats. From what I can see, Cap&#x27;n Proto is pretty much just a binary struct. That is pretty close to what we wanted to do with ION, except we wanted it to be compact on the wire too. We have seen that Cap&#x27;n Proto has a compaction mechanism, but we have not yet had time to analyze and compare it to ION&#x27;s.Cap&#x27;n Proto with compaction would be very similar to ION - on a conceptual level.<p>ION is a TLV encoding like Protobuf. Cap&#x27;n Proto is fixed offsets + pointers. These are vastly different styles of encoding that enable different modes of use. You can certainly debate which is better but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s correct to describe the formats as &quot;pretty close&quot;, unless you consider all binary formats to be &quot;pretty close&quot; to each other.",1454544782

The reason I was excited about it at first was because email is--in theory--decentralized, this part was very attractive to me because I thought this was one potential way to disrupt all existing content silos. However the more I worked on it the more I found out how &quot;centralized&quot; it is when it comes to consumer email. If you take a look around there are only a handful of popular email providers (gmail, yahoo mail, microsoft, etc.) Rest of them are indies. I felt like building a consumer email client (or anything that utilizes consumer email) is as limited as building a twitter client, you&#x27;re essentially tapping into a big platform. This is why I ran out of steam and put the idea on shelf until I come up with a compelling reason to start working on it again. I wasn&#x27;t motivated enough.",1454544293

To what you wrote I would add the observations that markets are created from the will of a central authority, and that the mob can become tyranny when not restrained by a more level-headed authority in whatever form.<p>These critiques (and more) are prominent in the neoreactionary literature on liberalism/libertarianism (but nowadays they have more important things to talk about). An interesting hypothesis of neoreaction is that liberal ideals, or even a libertarian world, will invariably lead to democratic socialism -- due to the power of the mob.<p>Personally, the foundation of my disillusionment with liberalism/libertarianism is the fact that people are so much more than economic units, and that collectivism trumps individualism. What&#x27;s important is preservation of heritage, culture, tradition, creation of art in all its beautiful forms, and the maximization of humanity&#x27;s potential.<p>I can&#x27;t see liberalism/libertarianism getting us much further than working on advertising systems to push junk food, while NASA spends half its time making reports to get a few more handouts, and cultures worldwide are systemically destroyed in the name of economic growth.",1454544269

It makes a kind of sense: GC has a CPU cost that gets lower the more memory is given to the heap, so if you have spare memory lying around, may as well deploy it to make things run faster.<p>Of course that isn&#x27;t always what you want (e.g. desktop apps) ... sometimes you&#x27;d rather spend the CPU and minimise the heap size. The latest Java versions on some platforms will keep track of total free system RAM and if some other program is allocating memory quickly, it&#x27;ll GC harder to reduce its own usage and give back memory to the OS.<p>In the benchmarks game I suspect there aren&#x27;t any other programs running at the same time, so Java will go ahead and use all the RAM it can get. Measuring it therefore won&#x27;t give reasonable results as the heap will be full of garbage.<p>Value types don&#x27;t have much to do with fragmentation, if anything they make it worse because embedding a value type into a larger container type results in needing larger allocations that are harder to satisfy when fragmentation gets serious. But ultimately a similar amount of data is going to end up in the heap no matter what. Yes, you can save some pointers and some object headers, so it&#x27;ll be a bit less. But not so much that it solves fragmentation.",1454544043

But it won&#x27;t take much tinkering to make it so - this is an age of gene therapy. The most important things here are that:<p>(a) a robust life extension was achieved with a SENS approach of damage repair, something that SENS advocates have been working towards for more than a decade. The SENS view is right. It is right today, as demonstrated, and it was right ten years ago when people were lining up to deride it. A SENS technology has produced a robust life extension and remediation of age-related diseases across the board in normal mice. People who think that SENS and damage repair are not the way forward need to take a long, serious look at why they think that, and then revisit the science.<p>(b) The Union Biotech VC and university PR machines are putting out word for word the SENS vision of damage repair to treat aging. SENS has won. This is the dawn of the age of rejuvenation biotechnology, with a near future of widespread support for that goal.<p>(c) There are at least three methods of clearing senescent cells in mammals, and most likely four. (1) The method of Oisin Biotechnology, seed funded last year by Methuselah Foundation and SENS Research Foundation, (2) the senolytic drug combination demonstrated last year, (3) the capase/gene trigger work linked here, and (4) the adaptation of method #3 currently underway at Union Biotechnology.<p>To be clear, half of these methods work in mammals now. If you had the right connections you could use them today. Clinical availability will not be a long time in coming, and I for one hope to see this escape the regulatory gauntlet very rapidly and get into medical tourism and clinics worldwide just like stem cell therapies did at the turn of the century.<p>Finally a note for investors and business people: every SENS rejuvenation technology of this ilk has a target market of every human being on the planet over the age of 30. Everyone, with treatments once every decade at a minimum. This is medicine that will make blockbuster drugs of past years look like damp squibs. That is why this should and will escape the narrow regulatory gauntlet that will try to restrict use to old people with the late stage of a few specific illnesses. That is nonsense and no way to run the future - senescent cells should be periodically cleared every few years starting at 30.",1454544040

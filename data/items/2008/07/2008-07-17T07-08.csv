248320,comment,247955,248034,0,0,swombat,,,"Having ""no interest"" in learning other languages is a serious bad mark against your brother, I'm afraid. He might be a ""very good"" programmer, but he'll never be great - never be a ""hacker"", by pg's definition.<p>I don't know any hacker who doesn't have an intense, irrepressible interest to learn new stuff - languages, frameworks, whatever. I also don't know a single hacker who hasn't learned well over half a dozen languages to a proficient level. And no, CSS and AJAX don't count (unless the Javascript is taken to a scary level). Sounds like your brother is a designer with some coding skills, not technical co-founder material.",1216281169

If he feels he's not capable of it, then he needs to adapt to the person who is capable of writing the entire product by themselves in their technology of choice - because that's the kind of person you want as a technology co-founder.<p>As I said, early employees are a different matter. They need to be shaped around - well, around the technology co-founder who wrote the whole product in a storm of caffeine fuelled fury.",1216280960

Se lisää QL:n käskysvalikoimaan GMOVE-käskyn, jolla voi siirtää grafiikkaa esimerkiksi piirto-ohjelmissa.<p>Here's one attempt at an awkward translation of the introductory paragraph:<p>""Have you ever come across a situation in which you would have wanted to move part of a window to another location?
Your task won't be successful without expanding the set of Basic instructions. It adds to QL's selection of commands the GMOVE command, with which you can move a graphic, for example, within a drawing program.""",1216279713

248304,comment,248149,248211,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Well, according to the first couple lines of the article, GMOVE stands for ""Graphic MOVE"". Further down it talks about pixels and graphics, x/y coordinates and leveys/korkeus which I take to mean width/height. (I don't speak Suomi, so that's about as far as I got)<p>Also, in the bold part in the middle of the first column, it gives the calling syntax:<p>GMOVE (#ch),x1,y1,l,k TO x2,y2<p>All of this evidence leads me to believe it's a blitting function. As for how it's implemented, I have no idea - looks to me like the DATA statements basically contain Sinclair QL bytecode. Anyone got a disassembler handy for that platform? ;-)<p>Out of interest, does anyone know what the (#ch) might be? The rest of the parameters are obvious.",1216278585

But it is quite fun to step through the code in gdb and you can learn quite a lot by hacking on it or implementing a DLL extension.<p>If trolling through language implementations is your kind of thing, I'd suggest having a look at Lua or Python as well (I never got Perl to configure, let alone compile) - then you can compare and contrast with the way things are done in Ruby.",1216278035

I thought it hasn't been included in kernels for a while. (save for the OSS->ALSA compatibility layer)<p>As for there being a large variety of user-space libraries: are we supposed to believe this to be a bad thing? In the past, we've needed sound servers, which have become pretty much entirely unnecessary as ALSA can do mixing, etc. (except for JACK, but even Windows has a completely different set of kernel audio drivers for professional sound recording)<p>These choices and the eventual elimination of some of them are a <i>good</i> thing: it means the better technology (as judged by developers & users) wins, not some decree. I don't know what other unix-derived OSes use, (OSS?) but on Linux-only libraries, I suspect OSS support will eventually disappear.<p>Now, of course Adobe would complain about this, as their plugin has to run on all possibly imaginable systems out of the box; there's no open-source component that interfaces with the hardware drivers so that the community could fix obscure problems themselves.",1216278022

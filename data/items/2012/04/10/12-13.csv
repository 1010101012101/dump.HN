This paper presents the impact of the first large-scale randomized evaluation of the OLPC program, using data collected after 15 months of implementation in 319 primary schools in rural Peru. The results indicate that the program increased the ratio of computers per student from 0.12 to 1.18 in treatment schools. This expansion in access translated into substantial increases in use both at school and at home. No evidence is found of effects on enrollment and test scores in Math and Language. Some positive effects are found, however, in general cognitive skills as measured by Ravens Progressive Matrices, a verbal fluency test and a Coding test."" - <a href=""http://www.iadb.org/en/research-and-data/publication-details,3169.html?pub_id=IDB-WP-304"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iadb.org/en/research-and-data/publication-details...</a><p>So, rather than it being a failure, all we're told is that, after 15 months, maths and reading don't show improvements, but other areas do.

Often, you don't even need an FTP client, since you can use your hosting provider's GUI.<p>That blinding level of simplicity gets the non-programmer started in under an hour.<p>To run Heroku (on a Mac), you need to download (1.8GB) and install XCode (or another version of GCC for Mac, but the moment you say GCC, the beginner's eyes glaze over). Once you install XCode, you need to open up terminal (no GUI). Then you install homebrew in order to install the dependencies that Heroku tools require (some JSON libs, if I recall). Once that's installed, you need to install the heroku cli tools.

PHP offers unparalleled flexibility if you have any notion whatsoever of how to properly develop things.<p>Those who think otherwise are most likely stalwart proponents of some other language, engulfed in functional programming or have read the latest post by _____ that explains a concept that should be used only rarely and will use it as an attack to state why another language is awful.<p>The fact is, you will never, ever, ever convince someone that your opinions are better than their own if they don't already think those things. Every language sucks and every language is awesome. Get over it. Bootstrap/CSS, HTML, jQuery and the database are easily 80% of the code of any generic site that isn't a business. The rest is Database access, AJAX functions, Auth, View rendering and hopefully security - and while important are very small in comparison to the grand scheme of things.<p>You don't need sockets. You don't need Duck typing. You don't need event-driven functionality to do most of the things you find on the internet. Those things are fun, but are not that important in the long run.<p>PHP is outdated, seemingly random and can let you write terrible code. It also does not get in your way if you are a competent developer and shortcomings are slowly being addressed, which is a good thing. When was the last time you wrote a site that NEEDED the things PHP is missing as a language?",1334060358

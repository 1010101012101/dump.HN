Just saying that Paul attracts a certain kind of person that has a strong tendency towards technical competence. These types of people often like to hang out with others of this type and so it has less to do with the man himself and more to do with finding people of like mind.<p>As for <i>tortured longing</i>, well, might I just put forth that some of us still work in some pretty dismal offices.

162961,story,,,14,9,jmtame,"Do startups work well when managed remotely?",,"I've had limited startup experience.  I do primarily design and LAMP development.  Currently doing JSP (new to MVC architecture but making the change fairly smoothly, usually I script and do front-end design).<p>I joined a startup just this past summer that received some funding from a popular VC firm and worked there as an intern over the summer.  I'm accustomed to being in the incubator, and being in the presence of the co-founders, while I work.<p>However, in my current position, everyone works remotely from their own locations.  There is office space, but it's out of the VC firm, there's not really dedicated incubator space for us.  The product is already developed for the most part, we're just focused on growth.<p>The entire team (about 6 and counting) operates this way.  Can anyone chime in and let me know what your experience and opinion on remote work on a startup is like?  Do you feel it's effective?",1208156162

The reason I buy Apple hardware is partly because of the design - it really is much more thought out - but also because this is where Apple makes its money (I know, I know - ipods make the most!) and therefore the hardware sales allow Apple to create the great software. They're really a software company and their OS is lovely.",1208156024

It's a small moral price a startup has to pay to get some momentum going, and without initial momentum, you really can't go anywhere. Sure, it's an annoyance on the user end, but if it's a truly useful service, I see no problem. Every user, especially in the initial stages, is valuable.",1208154457

162941,comment,162680,162715,0,0,gruseom,,,"I don't agree with this comparison. Rand has always struck me as an ideologue, someone who was rigidly attached to a system (and the inevitable movement to go along with it). I don't find this kind of ideological rigidity in Paul Graham's writing, which is both unpredictable and miscellaneous (it's about whatever the author happens to be interested in). If there's a common pattern, it's mostly a desire to figure things out and move on to the next thing; basically, curiosity. This is hardly reminiscent of Ayn Rand. That being said, I think I can understand why someone might read PG that way. He tends to put things in absolute terms. Some people see that as fanaticism. I don't. I think it comes from a desire to hit the nail on the head. It's more like trying to get a high score in a video game than like telling other people what to do.",1208154026

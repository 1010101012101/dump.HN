Spans N orders of magnitude in scale which is M orders of magnitude more than X sector.<p>2. A single individual can put out superb products while some teams put out mediocre products.<p>3. The possibility exists for companies to be created with J founders and reach a valuation of K in L years.<p>Sorry, but none of these are unique to software.  They're just the same arguments for anything else with different values for the variables.<p>Again, your sector is not unique.  Last time we thought software was a unique sector lead to the great ""paradigm shift"" (as Greenspan called it, I believe) of 2000.  You might know it better as the dot-com bubble.",1360191503

That's the same price as Apple was selling its 10"" iPad 2 16GB for.<p>Five months later, RIM slashed the prices of the PlayBook. The 16GB model was sold for $199, $6 below the Bill of Materials costs.<p>RIM sold 700,000 PlayBooks before they lowered the prices, and even when they were selling them at a loss, they only managed to sell 1 million more.<p>Aside from its price point, it's not hard to see why the PlayBook flopped. When it launched, there were hardly any third party apps for PlayBook, the OS lacked autocorrection, the onscreen keyboard was barely usable, there was no integration with cloud storage, the default search engine was Bing, it had no store for media content, and of course: it had no standalone e-mail and calendar software.",1360191491

A customer who stops by a mobile phone kiosk while walking through their local mall might not know how to handle a BB10 device without assistance from a sales associate. However, gestures often become second-nature, and users rarely find themselves asking ""how do I do this again?""<p>Swipe-upwards to unlock/return to homescreen requires initial contact with the screen's bezel, which should mitigate the number of times this gesture is unnecessarily actuated.",1360191411

5179441,story,,,1,0,juicegg,"Boeing Engineers Begin Vote On Strike This Week",,"23,000 Boeing engineers, members of SPEEA, have until February 19th to decide if they want to go on strike.<p>The strike would slow down fixing the 787, but it has wider implications: white collar, professional workers are not known for striking or belonging to unions - this strike can challenge that. Also, in an unusual move for any union, the SPEEA engineers are rejecting a new contract that splits the workforce into two tiers - Boeing is offering guaranteed pension benefits for current employees at the expense of new hires (who would receive a 401k instead of a pension). Grounding of 787 has given Boeing engineers additional leverage to demand Boeing to extend their original contract.<p>The union believes a strike would shut down Boeing production lines in Everett, Wash., where its big planes are made, as well as Renton, Wash., where it cranks out more than one of its widely-used 737s every day. A strike would also shut down Boeing's new, non-union plant in North Charleston, S.C., which makes 787s in addition to those assembled in Everett.<p>More info: http://www.manufacturing.net/news/2013/02/boeing-engineers-begin-vote-on-strike-this-week\nSPEEA: http://www.speea.org/Contact_Us/About_Us.html",1360191324

Yet there's obviously value in improving all these areas and they speed up almost every Ruby app.<p>It's overly simplistic to say the only option is to cache everything.  Or that your DB is going to be your ultimate bottleneck, so the other N - 1 items are worth investigating.<p>And even in the link you supplied, the illustrative example is getting a 20 hour process down to 1 hour without speeding up the single task that takes 1 hour.

Money!"" moment, followed by months of horror and disappointment.<p>They had to ""standardize"" our office which meant removing our wireless for ~6 months because ours wasn't ""secure"" enough.  They replaced it with open wireless that required a VPN to connect to.  That meant if you wanted to connect from your laptop to your desktop over wireless, your traffic was routed through some VPN gateway on the other side of the country and then back again.  Not to mention that all traffic meant for external domains was routed through a proxy.  Good luck trying to use skype or similar services to communicate.  They didn't provide any internal solutions.<p>The coffee was also taken away, and we were given pots of the some of the worst coffee I have ever tasted.  This is while our k-cup machines sat in a closet next to the kitchen.  We couldn't even bring our own k-cups to use because these were locked up.  We eventually got new coffee, but it took a lot of complaining.<p>All our email/im/phone/etc was switched to some horrible mismatch of open source or acquired products.  Nothing worked correctly and everything was so slow.  There was almost no integration between these either.  You know the webmail is bad when people would rather use Thunderbird as their mail client.  They also gave us all touch screen cisco phones that no one used because people don't use phones.<p>I was an iOS developer, which meant that I had a Mac.  My team needed a Mac mini for something, which required filling out a form that went all the way up to the office of the CEO and getting approval from some of the highest executives in the company.  This only took a couple months and a few more once it got sent to fulfillment.  Meanwhile on our business trip, Oracle had no problem paying for expensive meals, drinks, etc.  God forbid I actually want to spend money on work.  It's also a good thing my mac didn't die, because if it did, I would have to go through the same steps.<p>I could go on for hours about how dysfunctional things were and still are (although I no longer work there, but I keep in touch with many former coworkers).  The point of my post is to simply point out that all those steps on that site are great, unless you are getting acquired by a company that could care less about you as an employee and your work life.",1360191066

One of the interesting thing about working at NetApp, which had its own ""OS"" was that every driver was written by engineering. That allowed the full challenge of some of these devices to be experienced first hand.<p>One of the more painful summers resulted from a QLogic HBA which sometimes, for no apparent reason, injected a string of hex digits into the data it transmitted. There is a commemorative t-shirt of that bug with just the string of characters. It lead NetApp to putting in-block checksums into the file system so that corruption between the disk and memory, which was 'self inflicted' (and so passed various channel integrity checks) could be detected.<p>Here at Blekko we had a packet fragment that would simply vanish into the center switch. It would go in and never come out. We never got a satisfactory answer for that one. Keith, our chief architect, worked around it by randomizing the packet on a retransmit request.<p>The amount of code between your data and you that you can't control is, sadly, way larger than you probably would like.",1360190625

My experience in Italy is largely Emilia-Romagna, the breadbasket of Italy, and what they grill, out in the countryside, is nothing short of amazing.  Grilled salami on piadina (a unique soft local flatbread), big slabs of grilled pancetta dripping with fat and salt, just unbelievable.  I have had absolutely nothing approaching this in the US grill-wise.<p>So here's my list.<p>The US does better:<p>* Sandwiches (easily)<p>* Hearty soups<p>* Non-european, non-mediterranean international food (easily).  Ethiopian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Jamaican, Indonesian, Cuban, Mexican (duh), Vietnamese, Persian, Afghanistani and Pakistani, all vastly superior in the US than in Italy, if you can even get it.<p>* Anything US Jewish Traditional<p>* Large-fish seafood in some cases: stuff you make steaks out of.<p>* Cookies (sorry Italy)<p>* Cereal<p>* Steaks, maybe, it's a tough call<p>Italy does better:<p>* Seafood except for a few big fish.  No comparison.<p>* Most meat dishes of all kinds, except maybe steaks.<p>* Italian food (of course)<p>* German, Spanish, Greek, and Turkish food<p>* Salads<p>* Ice cream, without question<p>* Nearly all desserts<p>* By-the-pound deli-ish things<p>* Cheese and basically all milk products, no comparison<p>* Charcuterie (Salames, Sausages, pancettas, prosciuttos, etc.)  So much superior to even the best stuff in the US that it's not even funny.  Heck I'm married into a family which makes their own salame and prosciutto at a local farmhouse.  This is not uncommon.<p>* Vegetables of almost all kinds.  The only exceptions I can think of immediately are things that are unobtainable in Italy, like pecans.<p>* Organic products.<p>* The flour is more flexible.  Italians have both soft (low-gluten) flour for pizza and piadinas etc., and a hard (high-gluten) flour for breads.  It's <i>very</i> hard to get equivalent types or quality of flour in the US despite our huge wheat industry.<p>* Bread and pastries.  No contest.",1360190483

If there was a credit card transaction for every coin use then the minimums would have to be a lot higher in order to take into account processing fees.  You can't sell something for 20c paid by credit card.  Even a sale for $1 eats up a fair bit in processing fees.  But converting $20 into ""coins"" then allows the coin based transactions to be for far smaller amounts (eg equivalent to 10c).<p>Obviously Amazon and other virtual currency providers need to give you a good reason to get sucked in.  They are largely successful.  One approach that seems to work is paying to save time.  eg when playing a game you can unlock various items and make progress just by playing the game for quite a while.  Or you can do a transaction to accelerate that such as getting an item immediately or unlocking levels.<p>Americans also have a tendency to prefer fixed known in advance costs over variable ones.  Note for example how telephone service has been that way.  If you buy $20 worth of coins then you know you can never spend more than $20.  On the other hand if your credit card is on file and used in every transaction then you could end up being dinged for far more than you expected.",1360189714

5179162,comment,5177994,5178799,4,0,rjknight,,,"> The point of privilege is that you don't notice it. I think the disconnect here is that you assume that I'm making some kind of judgement about ignorance. I don't think people who are ignorant are 'bad.' Everyone needs to learn these things sometime.<p>The question of whether one acknowledges one's own privilege is orthogonal to the question of word usage.  I believe that I acknowledge my own privilege, but I do not see the benefit in trying to impose word usages on people, particularly in a threaded comment on a technology discussion forum.  I don't believe that it's a good strategy for persuading people of anything, which is a shame as there is much persuading to do.<p>My interpretation is that these kinds of word usage distinctions serve as signals; you want to signal enlightenment through the ""correct"" usage of a word, but what you're not understanding is that this <i>is</i> going to piss off people who don't understand what you're trying to say.  Insisting that the onus is on them to learn the ""correct"" meaning just pisses them off more, especially when they go off to read a dictionary or encyclopedia and it tells them that, in fact, they were right all along.  This just creates an ""us and them"" scenario in which the two sides identify themselves by linguistic characteristics.  <i>We're doing this to each other right now</i> even though I bet we agree a lot on the actual issues.<p>> If someone thinks ""I get discriminated against too, as a man, so I've experienced sexism"" they're totally talking past people who are discussing what it is for women to experience sexism, since they (the man) are only experiencing sexual discrimination.<p>Nope.  It depends entirely on what you think the word means.  What does the keyword ""sexism"" in the above statement represent?  If you think ""sexism"" means ""discrimination on the grounds of sex"" then ""I get discriminated against too, as a man, so I've experienced sexism"" is a true statement (assuming said discrimination occurs).  Nowhere does this imply that the experience for men is the same as the experience for women - sexism (defined as sexual discrimination) can differ by degree and by frequency, and we'd all acknowledge that it is of far greater degree and far more frequently experienced by women.  It is not obvious that this presents any difficulty in discussing the matter accurately.  You could easily say ""pervasive sexism"" or ""systemic sexism"" or ""institutional sexism"" when you want to make a further qualifying point about the nature of the discrimination taking place.<p>I think we'll have to agree to disagree, as neither of us is going to be proved right here.  I'll conclude by saying that I think people often say quite reprehensible things about sexism on HN and elsewhere and I don't wish to encourage them by disagreeing with people who are obviously trying to do the right thing.  That said, I am not sure the battle over semantics is the one we need to win and fighting it may well be counter-productive.",1360188504

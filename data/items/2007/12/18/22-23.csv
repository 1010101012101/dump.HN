That will happen mainly for the same reason there are tons of regulatory hurdles in place for Hydrogen powered cars. There is a lot of power that will need to be shifted before this becomes a reality.<p>You can barely drive a segway on the sidewalk, you think you're going to be allowed to install a nuclear reactor in your basement?",1198018003

People don't like change generally. <p>I'm not saying it shouldn't happen, or that it won't. All I'm saying is that the type of disaffection these types of changes create usually creates a short period of misery while the power (no pun there) is shifted to the new order.<p>Every technological change of this magnitude has resulted in political fallout. To suggest otherwise is hopelessly naive.<p>Not everyone is able to see this as opportunity - most will see it as a threat to the status quo they enjoy.",1198017897

90917,comment,90726,90857,0,0,timr,,,"On my personal wish-list of reforms is an incredibly high (say, 90%) tax on short-term capital gains for real estate investments.<p>The whole justification for the mortgage interest write-off (which is otherwise just a gigantic government handout to property owners), is that it promotes home ownership, the family unit, etc.  The problem is, there's no equivalent dis-incentive for short-term speculation on property, and what was <i>intended</i> to be an incentive for family home ownership actually helped to fuel the ponzi scheme that is effectively driving families out of their homes today.<p>If short-term gains on home sales were taxed at very high rates, it would basically be impossible for ""investors"" to flip homes for short-term profits.  A huge incentive for speculative price increases in the housing market would be eliminated.<p>(Plus, no more stupid TV shows about house flipping.  It's win-win!)",1198016800

Name it something like ""PartCounter"" or ""CustCtr"".  Then you won't have to write many comments.  Your code can be largely self-commenting.<p>As a general rule of thumb (IMO), never name any variable with less than 3 characters and never allow one variable name to be completely contained within another (Ctr & CustCtr).  Being able to find every instance of a variable (and nothing else) with a simple editor global search will save you much time and headaches over the next n years.

Can you build it quickly to test your theory?  If your theory is off-base, can you quickly shift?  I think Fred is a fairly discerning and successful investor...  It's interesting to note that 2/3 of the successful teams that he has invested in have been WRONG about their initial product direction.",1198015357

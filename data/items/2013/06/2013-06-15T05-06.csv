5884260,comment,5883504,5883504,7,0,comex,,,"A small observation: CoreFoundation typedefs CFTypeRef (the generic object type) to void * , rather than having obj * be a separate type as in this library.  This lets you pass pointers to any CF type to functions that expect CFTypeRe without the ugly cast: it&#x27;s unsafe, as you can pass a pointer to any type without the compiler complaining, but so is explicitly casting.  If you&#x27;re not going to go the void * route, it would be nice to provide some macro like obj(x) to safely cast only valid types to object.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s nice to see a portable, modern CF-like library, although of course it&#x27;s too slow for some cases where code specialization is called for.<p>Edit: On the general subject of C data structures, in case anyone&#x27;s interested, I wrote a little portable C header that provides minimal hash table functionality using macros, with a large amount of control - still generic, but totally opposite to the approach used by this library, much lower level.  It&#x27;s modeled after the BSD <sys/queue.h> header, provides three versions (open, closed, and a higher level version), and is completely undocumented, but I&#x27;m somewhat happy with it as a proof of concept.

So, what?<p>> Now let&#x27;s say I make the same wage but I get a guaranteed $20k tax-free. For every hour I work, I earn $12 post-tax. My income looks like y=12x+20000. 44k/year if I work a regular 40 hour week. But I could also work only 20 hours a week and still make $32k/year, doubling my effective wages. I could work 10 hours a week and bring in $26k/year. Or work a single hour and make an effective hourly rate of $22,012 in that one hour.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t really matter. Total income over hours worked isn&#x27;t what measures the incentive to work, the marginal utility (not the same as dollar amount, to be sure, as income experiences diminishing marginal utility) of the <i>next</i> dollar is what sets the incentive. So, sure, the incentive is <i>less</i> in a system with basic income compared to one otherwise identical without it -- but nowhere near what you are portraying.<p>> People are absolutely smart enough to see how that works and many of them will choose not to work at all.<p>Sure, some will, but to an extent that&#x27;s the <i>point</i>; people are going to be without wage labor one way or another.<p>> Yeah, it might be true that you don&#x27;t live anywhere near as fun of a lifestyle on $20k/year as $44k/year but that&#x27;s only if you value spending money.<p>You mean, if you value <i>any</i> of the things for which money can be exchanged.

If I want to publish pictures of my house, I would likely use some sort of internet service to do so... therefore:<p>The laws around private companies photographing private property are both (1) very restrictive and (2) well known and well tested in court.

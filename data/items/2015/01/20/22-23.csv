It may work out like Spritualism, where the movement ran strong for a relatively brief period and then petered out under the withering light of popular scrutiny.  Its effects on our culture are still omnipresent, but very few people subscribe to it nowadays because the idea that the dead are with us and want to communicate to us - but only for the sake of performing party tricks and sharing the most tedious of banalities - is hard to really take seriously.<p>The UFO meme&#x27;s not so different.  Super-advanced races using their incomprehensibly superior technology to fling themselves across the near-infinite vastness of space are visiting us in order to. . . prank aircraft pilots, share tedious banalities and diddle butts.

8920266,comment,8919343,8920178,0,0,fecak,,,"I&#x27;ve dealt with many companies large and small (retained recruitment, tech) that have admitted early on to flaws in their hiring process. Typically, I find it&#x27;s someone in engineering all the way up to the CTO that admits the process is broken, and they generally want to circumvent internal HR processes to get the candidate to their potential boss and co-workers as efficiently as possible.<p>HR typically wants to control as much of the process as possible, which often means an HR screening first. This tends to turn off engineers considerably, as it&#x27;s deemed a waste of time, so the first step in the process is perceived negatively and that negative first impression is hard to overcome. The clients I&#x27;ve represented that have the smoothest process are those that use HR to facilitate and provide answers to questions, but to try and limit involvement beyond that.",1421794723

For example:\n  - You suffer from imposter syndrome.  Not that uncommon.\n  - The companies you work for have fired people regularly (read: startups).  You notice these people are not always incompetent, but more often bad at politics or unlucky.\n  - You have others to support where the risk of being fired just isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>Or, put it another way.  Incoming netflix hires already have this expectation, so you&#x27;d expect the incompetent to self-select, as you&#x27;ve suggested.  Yet netflix is reportably still firing often, which suggests one of the following is happening:\n  1) people who are so incompetent that they don&#x27;t know they are incompetent are getting through netflix&#x27;s hiring process\n  2) something else is happening and incoming netflix hires should absolutely be worried about being fired.",1421794722

Unix through XWindows from a pc was actually quite nice.\nI think developers like users use feelings more than thoughts when choosing an environment. Yes, you can do some things on Linux that are harder on Windows but saying that missing &quot;grep&quot; is severly limiting you is strange since it is easy to install. And you have find in most editors. You can run Vim or Emacs if you want to on Windows. Powershell is very good but with a strange syntax. If that is someones problem they sound like they don&#x27;t want to learn something new. Listing thousands of files in a folder is probably still faster on Linux but I rarely do that (I can&#x27;t see the point in collecting many years of logs in one folder, for example).

8920020,comment,8916748,8919117,0,0,quanticle,,,">Considering the actual missions flown over the last 50 years I think the Air force’s priorities are much more reasonable.<p>That is a very, very difficult point to defend. The <i>vast</i> majority of USAF missions over the past 50 years have been CAS missions against ground forces, not jet-against-jet duels against other air superiority fighters. Yet, if you look at the design priorities of not just the current state-of-the-art fighters, but even previous-gen fighters like the the F-15, F-16 and the F-18, you&#x27;ll see that they privilege air-to-air combat capability over air-to-ground.<p>IMHO, the only plane in the USAF&#x27;s inventory that&#x27;s actually suited for the missions the USAF is actually flying is the A-10. And if you look at the A-10&#x27;s history, you&#x27;ll see that the USAF leadership fought tooth and nail against the program (it was essentially forced on the USAF by the Army), and at every feasible opportunity they&#x27;ve tried to retire the airframe.<p>Stealth isn&#x27;t magic. Stealth doesn&#x27;t make you invisible. Stealth is, at best, a very sophisticated camouflage that makes your plane harder to see with radar at a distance, and its advantages end the moment your plane starts shooting. Contra your point, stealth is actually <i>most</i> suited for the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; style missions which are designed to crush enemy air forces in the opening days of an engagement. That&#x27;s actually what it was designed for. The F-22 (and other stealth aircraft) were designed to wipe out Soviet aircraft and air-defense systems in the opening days of WW3, at which point more conventional fighters (like F-4s, F-15s and A-10s) would do the majority of the &quot;grunt work&quot; of wiping out Soviet ground armor.<p>Stealth is far less suited for the kinds of &quot;patrol&quot; missions where your planes are going to be flying the same airspace day and day out, supporting ground troops or enforcing a no-fly zone. As the evidence from the F-117 shootdown in Yugoslavia demonstrates, all the camouflage in the world won&#x27;t help you if your enemy is able to deduce where you will be based on your past activity. Stealth is poorly suited for close-air support missions, where you&#x27;re flying close to enemy troops, for long periods of time, and shooting at them on a regular basis.<p>The Air Force&#x27;s priorities have not been reasonable, by any rational measure, nor have they been reasonable for quite some time now. The Air Force should be investing in developing UAVs and the accompanying swarm tactics that allow for effective use of large numbers (e.g. 100+) aircraft in a combat theater. Instead, they&#x27;re blowing billions of dollars on a &quot;unified&quot; combat aircraft that can&#x27;t actually perform any of the roles it&#x27;s supposed take over.<p>EDITS: Added points and restructured for clarity.",1421792017

I used to be very interested in UFO stuff but have completely given up looking at websites and so on because ther is too much shit to wade through. Lowish evidentiary standards were somewhat tolerable when the resources required to organize and study it were so much greater - there was a limit to what any one author could do. But with the internet, forums, worldwide mapping software, open-source image-processing tools and what-all else, UFO classification should be many many times better than it is, just as most scientific endeavors have benefited from digital technology. Instad there are forums like Godlikeproductions and prisonplanet that are mostly populated by gullible and/or mentally ill people.<p>If you want this issue taken seriously, then treat it seriously - use standards of evidence, consider things in their social context (eg many UFO reports were classified because of cold war paranoia and the desire to maintain a strategic military advantage), winnow out the wheat from the chaff, and invite people to falsify rather than endorse difficult cases. As you pointed out elsewhere, many people have trouble processing complex scientific information like climate change and so are reflexively skeptical about it.

Actually, my impression is that there are very few of those, who I&#x27;d consider genuinely good people that I would really trust.<p>The thing is, you can be a really good person or you can be an a-hole, you will enter an industry or create a startup that will fit your personality and then it just comes down to IQ and persistence of how successful you will become. This way, a bad/nasty person can create a startup or make money just as much as a really kind person can. In other words, you can create a huge startup either way, the valuations would be the same, irrespective if you are a good person or not.<p>However, the startups would also be completely different in nature. The nasty startup would be always fighting, receive bad press and its employees would be led by fear. The good startup would be awesome, change an entire industry for the good and its employees don&#x27;t work for the money, but because they are inspired by its mission and by its CEO.<p>Both startups would be huge and probably end up having the same valuation, just that their nature is different.<p>For that reason, as a founder you need to ask yourself what kind of founder you want to be. You can be nasty or you can be kind and awesome. It &quot;doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; what side you choose, you will be equally successful either way.<p>However, you need to understand the implications and if you want to be a person that makes people worries or the person that inspires people and creates good in the world.<p>You can be good or bad, you&#x27;ll still be successful, however, after you have built the startup, 10 years after you have sold it even, it&#x27;s the way of how you did it that counts.",1421791233

Google was attractive to users because it gave them what they wanted - instead of the busy &quot;portals&quot; and paid placement. It was fast, honest, clear and had a better ranking algorithm.<p>Today, people don&#x27;t want to be tracked/monitored, and unfortunately that is key to Google&#x27;s business model. They were right to aggressively try to head off facebook, but wrong to abuse users to do it. They are definitely &quot;evil&quot; (their &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; meant don&#x27;t be like microsoft or IBM, who pushed users around as it suited.  Arguably, a publically traded corp is legally obliged to put profit above people - ie be &quot;evil&quot;; but it is possible to serve both, as google once did).<p>So, DDG is giving users what they want, and out-googling google, in a specific sense.<p>It&#x27;s been said it&#x27;s difficult to create <i>sustainable competitive advantage</i> in search, because users can trivially switch. But one thing google has been great at is fast response times. Users really care about this, and because it&#x27;s so expensive to build huge server farms all over the world, this aspect is a SCA. DDG is far slower than google; and google suggest often feels local to me. Perhaps this could be replicated with AWS, but DDG hasn&#x27;t done it.<p>But I think you&#x27;re right: previously DDG was a niche success. But with the change in what users want (because of NSA/snowden revelations, and likely there&#x27;ll be others), that is absolutely inconsistent with Google&#x27;s business model for ads, then DDG really could overthrow them. But DDG make enough money to afford comparable server-farm investment? (Still, that gets cheaper all the time...)<p>Google could of course go back to being purely about search, and not acquire user data so aggressively... but giving up user modeling would massively undermine their ad profits, and they are now slaves to Wall Street.<p>So... interesting.",1421791222

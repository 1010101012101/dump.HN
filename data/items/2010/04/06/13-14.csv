We are building a marketplace for research and university software.  Right now, distribution and commercialization of software from university labs is difficult due to university licensing restrictions and the lack of a centralized marketplace.  Thus, a lot of software is being re-built each time it is needed for a specific research application.<p>This is a huge waste of developers’ time and valuable research dollars.<p>We are partnering with leading universities (Cornell, Columbia, Yale and others) to enable this marketplace.  Software creators can distribute any software with applications (in any field) for free, or set their own price and we’ll handle the e-commerce and distribute the revenue.<p>http://www.labapp.com<p>We just launched in beta, and I’d love to hear feedback from the HN community!  Here are some elements of the site that won’t be visible now, but are on our plates:<p>-  Detailed analytics for sellers and tech transfer officers<p>-  Search<p>-  Categories (e.g., genomics, neuroscience, etc.)<p>-  Some static content (e.g., “Learn More”)<p>Also, if you have anything that you’d like to distribute via LabApp, don’t hesitate to upload it.",1270562073

If I understand how certificates work correctly, essentially what this means is that any certificate that is signed by these root certificates is automatically trusted by your Firefox browser.<p>The implication, and what makes this scary, is that if this were done with malevolent intentions, there could be a whole host of sites out there that had ""bogus"" certificates that Firefox would think were fine because they were signed by this trusted authority.<p>Just as an aside, you can always see the certificate chain in Firefox by clicking on the favicon area when a certificate is in use (i.e. when using https), clicking on ""More Information"", clicking ""View Certificate"", and going to the ""Details"" tab.  You can then see the ""Certificate Hierarchy"".  This shows you all the certificates in the chain, and who signed what.  At the very top should be the ""root authority""; this is usually someone like Verisign.<p>To bring this whole thing around, then, on some sites, you could see the root authority as the certificate mentioned in the post.<p>I guess, finally, I should point out, like others have, that this doesn't really mean anything bad is going on; the certificate could be perfectly valid.

One out of twenty-five students in K-12 education outnumbers homeschoolers, for example. As I have posted elsewhere on HN recently, I have extensive experience as a parent with online education. I mentioned one provider in a recent post, to which I will no longer give repeat business, and our family has tried other online learning providers on various occasions. As an overall part of our homeschooling program, I like COMMUNITY in online education a lot, and that is what I will shop for in the future, besides excellent classes with a solid reputation and good placement and a thorough curriculum. On the whole, online classes are probably even easier to muff than in-person classes (my current occupation is providing in-person classes, intentionally designed to fit niches not now filled by online classes), but where online classes shine is in providing alternatives for which parents can shop when locally available classroom alternatives don't meet learner needs. There is still much work to be done in this market, but already plenty of opportunity for an eager learner to break out of the limitations of the local school oligopoly.",1270560215

Well, various CA root certificates are built into browsers. It seems that Mozilla has been shipping with a potentially rogue root authority for a while now, so there's the potential that whoever owned that certificate / IP might have been abusing it -- all the while having that comforting green tick in your browser to say the certificate is valid.<p><a href=""http://www.rapidssl.com/ssl-certificate-support/ssl-faq.htm#8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rapidssl.com/ssl-certificate-support/ssl-faq.htm#...</a>",1270560198

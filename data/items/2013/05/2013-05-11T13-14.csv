5690584,comment,5690235,5690235,7,0,oinksoft,,,"I think the zsh-vs-bash debate is centered on minimalist vs. full-featured. For instance, the git completion example is very ugly in zsh to me. I know what git commands do, and I'd much prefer for the completion to take 1-2 lines total than one line per possible command, as in the zsh example. The prompt examples are similar -- my PS1 is<p><pre><code>  local green=""$(tput setaf 2)""
  local reset=""$(tput sgr0)""
  export PS1=""\[$green\]>>\[$reset\] ""
</code></pre>
And a multiline prompt, let alone one with right-justified elements, is pretty gruesome to me.<p>The first slides about availability on Macintoshes don't resonate, because I'm going to have MacPorts on any dev box and use that to install the latest. It's more likely I ssh to a server that has Bash 4 and no Zsh than anything else, so it also makes sense to know bash and have a good .bashrc ready to scp up there if I'm going to be doing a lot of work on the server.<p>zsh spellcheck is very annoying, thankfully it can be disabled. This is my preferred spellcheck solution ;^) <a href=""https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl</a><p>All that being said, zsh is a really cool piece of software. It's one of those things I've always wanted to really stretch to its limits, but I've never been able to hang with it for more than a few months, which I doubt is enough time to really become accustomed to the workflows zsh allows (like the /u/b/... expansion example in the slides).",1368280575

I've seen intra-day transaction dbs that are completely flattened. If your next port of call is a highly normalised relational database, you're going to hit another wall fast enough.<p>4.

(Or worse, muddying their code up to make it ""fast."")<p>It's also for <i>experienced</i> programmers who dink around with macro-optimizations. For example, designing an entire application to be serializable-multi-threaded-contract-based when there's only a handful of calls going through the system. Or creating an abstract-database-driven-xml-based UI framework to automate the creation of tabular data when you have under a dozen tables in the application.<p><i>premature optimization is the root of all evil</i> is a really <i>really</i> important mindset, and I agree it doesn't mean to  not optimize, and many developers seem to take it that way.<p>X+1 = How many transactions your business does today<p>Y = How many transactions your business needs to do in order to survive<p>Y/X = What the current application needs to scale to in order to simply <i>survive</i>. This is the number where people start receiving paychecks.<p>(Y/X)4 = How far the current application needs to scale in order to grow.<p>The goal should be to build an application that can just barely reach (Y/X)4 - this means building unit tests that test the application under a load of (Y/X)4 and optimizing for (Y/X)4<p>Spending time trying to reach (Y/X)20 or (Y/X)100 is what I'd call premature optimization.<p>Disclaimer: (Y/X)4 is no real point of data that I know of, just something I pulled out as an example, anyone who knows of actual metrics used please feel free to correct.",1368278630

He didn't say that you have to BECOME a programmer, or even try; he just said to walk a mile in developer shoes to recognize some of what it's like.<p>TypicalProg says that there is more to programming than just hacking on python for a weekend...<p>Both are true, and both are different points.<p>So many comments on HN about ""clueless bosses"", yet here's a guy who says, in the WSJ for all to hear, that he wants to eliminate that.  He doesn't say he wants to replace real devs with weekend-warriors.  He says that if you want to work in the real world, you need to understand some of the tech behind the scenes.<p>How is this different from bankers learning finance, or doctors learning about medicine?  B/c, as it turns out, EVERY job touches tech, and his point is that if you don't suck it up and learn some tech, no matter what job you do, you won't do as well as you could in it.  He's not expecting everyone to code, he's expecting everyone to have some appreciation of _what it takes to code_.<p>I'm kind of astonished at the defensive comments, actually.  I too require that anyone working for me learn about the tech behind the magic.  Why?  Because it creates RESPECT for the developers.  Every negative comment about clueless bosses reflects a time when a developer has been subject to a lack of _respect_ and _appreciation_ for what it takes to make production-level digital experiences.<p>McDonald appear to recognizes that flaw, and is trying to fix it.  He admits he's not a dev, and so he tries to understand enough to do no evil.  Isn't that the level of respect we would want from any boss, esp a CEO outside of the ""tech"" or ""engineering"" group in a company?<p>I don't know him, but I agree with him.  I'm surprised to see some of the vitriol.

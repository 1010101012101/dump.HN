I&#x27;m back to full-time now, but here&#x27;s how I did it:<p>1. I had 6 month emergency savings.  I figured the worst thing that could happen was having to job hunt and return to normal FTE.  The job market felt safe to me.<p>2. I did this by freelancing.  I could not find any ~20 hour part-time job for developers.<p>3. It&#x27;s not difficult to start at $50/hour and move your way up as a developer.<p>4. I eventually moved to a day rate.  Instead of working ~4 hour days, I worked 2-3 days per week.  This helped deal with my goal lifestyle (only wanted to answer client calls while I was in the office, preferred batched work instead of 1-2 hours here and there, etc...)<p>5. My living expenses weren&#x27;t extravagant.  Probably low considering I&#x27;m in the Bay Area.  Even at 20 hours/week, I made sure the math worked out and that I&#x27;d still have a solid buffer just in case.<p>It immediately made me much happier.  I started spending afternoons jogging around the local lake, playing video games, spending more time with parents/grandparents, working on side projects.  It felt like the opposite of burnout.  Of course, there were still problems:<p>1. Explaining to friends/family.  There was a lot of criticism about how I was wasting money, being lazy, or being irresponsible.  Worse was the constant &quot;did you find a job yet?&quot; question.  At the end of the day, if you&#x27;re financially sustaining yourself/family and not assuming too much risk -- you&#x27;re not being irresponsible!<p>2. From the clients I&#x27;ve had experience with, most preferred full time contracts.  It was a little more difficult finding 20 hours or less per week.<p>3. Droughts suck.  I had a ~1 month drought that doubled my vacation length.  Saying &quot;No&quot; to a full-time request means they&#x27;ll find someone else who can work full time.<p>Hope this helps anyone else considering the jump.",1397073579

It can be argued that StartSSL is not actually providing an acceptable level of security, since the ability to revoke and regenerate a certificate is part of the service that a CA should provide. If StartSSL isn&#x27;t performing security audits, gives out free certificates like candy, but charges for maintaining security, none of the free certificates are actually known to have any level of security.<p>There are many websites using StartSSL certificates that could also be using a compromised private key.

The specific example was the exploit mitigations in OpenBSD&#x27;s malloc, which are neutered for OpenSSL because (for dubious stated reasons) it insists on wrapping the system malloc with its own caching variant.  The same would apply, of course, to more straightforward measures like a malloc() which just cleared out the returned memory before turning it over to the app.<p>And this isn&#x27;t the only thing about the OpenSSL codebase which seems likely to frustrate attempts at analysis.

I run a service (tny.im) where HTTPS is not essential, but I like to provide it, to secure logins if not for anything else. However, I make little to no money from that website, and so I rather not invest much money in it. By the price SSL certs go, if StartSSL became untrusted, I&#x27;d have no choice but remove SSL support, or issue my own certificate which is as bad as not having HTTPS.<p>StartSSL plays an important role in ensuring that all websites, no matter how small, can provide https access. I recommend it to people that are just launching a service; their reaction often is like &quot;SSL? You know how much that costs? I can barely pay for the server!&quot; but they happily go through the trouble of installing a StartSSL cert when they understand that it will only cost them the effort. Without StartSSL these people would never implement https, if for some reason they didn&#x27;t want to spend money with their project as is often the case with things done in their spare time.<p>Personally this is even more disgusting, because I know for sure that my certificate has not been compromised: two days ago my service was hosted on a server with OpenSSL 0.9.8, and today I was forced to migrate to a new server due to issues unrelated to Heartbleed, and the certificate was not installed before updating OpenSSL to a patched version. And as some users have said, other people may be using StartSSL free certs on systems that don&#x27;t even use OpenSSL.<p>There&#x27;s also something we should not forget: free StartSSL certificates are only valid for one year. That means that any cert will only be compromised for, at most, a year. My cert will expire in June, and then I&#x27;ll be able to issue a new one, which (even if I wasn&#x27;t sure the current one isn&#x27;t) definitely isn&#x27;t compromised.",1397072603

This means, of course, that the maximum utility schedule happened to lie in the subset of schedules satisfying both constraints, and you so there is no utility loss. The double-major in this case is just an added bonus of doing what you wanted to do, and I&#x27;m happy for people lucky enough to find themselves in that situation. From my time in college, though, I remember a number of people who were reasoning along the lines of &quot;Well, I&#x27;m just three boring classes away from a double major... might as well pick it up I guess.&quot; For people in that situation, where they don&#x27;t really want to take the extra three required classes, I&#x27;m arguing that the double major isn&#x27;t worth the utility loss.<p>> Degree requirements exist because the degree committee (and accreditation organization) believe they have have a better sense of overall utility than most students.<p>Indeed, and good point: If you don&#x27;t have a good sense of your utility function, then the decision to double major is roughly equivalent to using the implied utility function of the degree committee to help estimate your own utility.

Is their style productive, or is it unproductive but they get away with it because they&#x27;re so good that people will put up with it?<p>You say that the best course of action if you want to avoid Theo&#x27;s ire is not to write bad code, but how many people have taken another approach? The one that springs to mind is not working with him and how much talent does the project miss out on because people just steer clear? I know plenty of very smart programmers who simply don&#x27;t go near projects where the culture and personalities are like that. Bad behaviour towards others (even when you&#x27;re right) limits the available pool of skills.<p>2) I can live with the arsehole geniuses but others who aren&#x27;t as able often use the likes of Jobs or Theo to justify their own poor, destructive behaviour.

It&#x27;s a show on rails, with ostensible &#x27;nerds&#x27; as set dressing. Provided you watch it as a formulaic, mildly entertaining sitcom, it serves that purpose. Occasionally you can nod knowingly at catching Sheldon&#x27;s obscure-to-the-general-public science references.

Compare, for example, Big Bang Theory and Community. The former has more putatively &#x27;nerdy&#x27; characters, but it&#x27;s by no means a nerdy show. The latter revels in its obscurity, geekery, and absurdity, even though only one of the characters is supposed to be a &#x27;nerd&#x27; in the vein of BBT&#x27;s Sheldon. General Population watches BBT for entertainment, but also for a sort of paradoxical validation: to feel &#x27;in&#x27; on the nerdery, but mostly to place a safe distance between itself and nerdery. Nerds, meanwhile, watch shows like Community, which make no bones about their nerdery.<p>Traditionally, the gulf between content &#x27;for nerds&#x27; and &#x27;about nerds&#x27; has been pretty wide.

Both of them noticing exploitation in the wild, or both being prompted to give a fresh look by an outside inquiry, seem possible.<p>But I suppose the most likely possibility is that the Apple and GnuTLS bugs earlier this year made many groups begin a deeper look at trusted-but-not-really-well-reviewed code. OpenSSL fits that category, and with many (?) teams now combing it, discovery collisions during the window of time between &quot;1st realization&quot; and &quot;released fix&quot; are more likely.<p>Still, if doing a fresh & deep look at OpenSSL, and finding something of this magnitude: would a researcher race to both inform OpenSSL and deploy a fix ASAP, <i>or</i> would they instead, suspecting there&#x27;s much more low-hanging-fruit, try to review further before disclosure and batch things up so the eventual shock/pain can be handled in one internet-wide emergency, not many?<p>Which is a roundabout way of asking: are we about to get a bunch of these trickled out as Mehta, Codenomicon, & others continue to work through the code, or did we just get this because that review process completed?",1397070285

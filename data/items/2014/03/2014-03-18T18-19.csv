The hype of bitcoin was quite large and pretty much anyone computer literate would have heard of it, especially a guy who&#x27;s name is Satoshi Nakamoto.<p>Oh come on, that is just silly. I am positive there is computer literate people who haven&#x27;t heard of bitcoin. Not everyone checks Hacker News, or news at all. I know I never watch/check the regular news, its extremely possible he never heard of it.<p>>Dorian was first informed of bitcoin through email, which means he likely could not have confused that word with anything else.<p>And not everyone has a good memory. The author could have asked him about bitcoin without explaining to him what it was which is why he didn&#x27;t answer her questions, then he forgot what she was asking about, since it wasn&#x27;t notable. Nobody is going to remember everything.<p>>Finally, his claim of the &quot;accusation&quot; hurting his job prospects are quite silly, since he&#x27;s been out of work for more than a decade.<p>He has also had health problems in that decade which could have prevented him from seeking employment.<p>>Plus, it&#x27;s pretty rare to be this vehement in your denials unless there actually is some truth to the accusation<p>Oh come on. He wants to be left alone! Of <i>course</i> he is going to be vehement in his denials so people will leave him the hell alone.<p>>Finally, his claim of the &quot;accusation&quot; hurting his job prospects are quite silly.<p>He is an immigrant. He might have a different cultural view than you over what hurts a job prospect. For example, I once visited a country where cheating in school was rampant. It was not only the norm, but completely socially acceptable, and it was though by the teachers that every student would cheat given the chance. Someone from that culture may not believe getting caught cheating would hurt their job prospects, for example. Stop looking at everything from your point of view. Furthermore, what&#x27;s with the scare quotes in accusation? Even if the accusation is true, he was still publicly accused of being the bitcoin founder. It is irrelevant if the accusation is true or false, it is still an accusation.",1395169128

However, based on your blog post, the E2 Visa can and should meet most of your requested requirements.  The E2 Visa is a non-immigrant 5 year Visa with unlimited extensions.<p>In short if YC were to create a funding entity in the home country of a foreign national, and meet the &quot;capital requirements&quot; on a case by case basis (note there is no capital minimum, just vague criteria that must be proven, which YC would be in an ideal position to prove simply based on the nature of YC&#x27;s experience and existing data), there is no reason this Visa should not suffice and give you supporting data of your claims while you continue to lobby for legislative change.<p>If you have already discussed the E2 with counsel and been dissuaded I am curious as to why E2 would not meet the needs of YC, because believe that this model in and of itself is a potential startup that solves the problems of other startups, namely YC and other incubators looking to fund more foreign nationals.",1395169111

7424144,comment,7422293,7423952,1,0,Jemaclus,,,"For my address problem, here&#x27;s a couple of things I want to see:<p>* You can look an address and identify the different parts\n* You can come up with simple ways to split up the address. Most people start off with saying &quot;Well, there&#x27;s a comma after the street and a comma after the city, and then state and ZIP have a space in between, so if I split it up like that, I have all the parts.&quot;\n* You can tackle more difficult addresses (i.e., What do you do if there are no commas? If someone leaves off a ZIP code?) Bonus points if you consider these things before you bring them up\n* Actually write an algorithm to solve it. This is a little more involved, but basically, the way you write the algorithm tells me things about what you know. If you choose to use regular expressions, that tells me you&#x27;re confident enough with regular expressions to use them in an interview. If you decide to explode the string and work word by word, that tells me something else. If you decide to work left to right, right to left, etc. If you make assumptions or not, that tells me things.<p>The great thing about addresses is that the format is pretty standard and everyone pretty much understands the nuances of it. For instance, what kind of ZIP codes are there? What are the possible values for a state? Given this knowledge, you should be able to make some assumptions and <i>very easily</i> figure out where State and ZIP are, or if they&#x27;re even present.<p>You&#x27;d be surprised how many people never get that far, even with hints and prompting from me. They&#x27;ll stop at the comma thing, or they&#x27;ll say &quot;I&#x27;d use machine learning&quot; like that&#x27;s a magic wand of some kind.<p>More importantly, when I introduce edge cases they hadn&#x27;t considered, how do they change the algorithm? Is it a minor change, or do they have to go back to square one? Some edge cases dramatically change the entire situation.<p>And then there are some really tricky cases. For instance, if you decide to make the (perfectly valid) assumption that streets end in a suffix (e.g., &quot;Street&quot;, &quot;Avenue&quot;, &quot;Boulevard&quot; or their abbreviations) and then decide to split the string there with the street on the left and the city/state/ZIP on the right, that sounds like a good idea. But what if it&#x27;s &quot;123 Main St W&quot;? How does that change things? And then imagine that you have &quot;123 Main St West Palm Beach FL&quot;... does that West belong with the street or the city? What if there&#x27;s also a &quot;123 Main St Palm Beach FL&quot;? How does that change things?<p>And so on. Most of the time, people solve the simple thing. Then as I add edge cases, I want to see how they solve them. Usually this takes about 15, 20 minutes total. The best candidates wind up getting <i>close enough</i> to the way I did it when I first solved the problem. (I&#x27;ve since then solved for all of these edge cases, but that took me months.)<p>I don&#x27;t really care about the exact solution. If you get stuck at the part without commas, that&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll skip it and give another edge case. I just want to see how you think, how you solve the problem.<p>I can teach you Python or Ruby or PHP. I can teach you the syntax necessary to parse a string. What I can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t have time to do is teach you how to solve problems.  The programming bit is trainable. The problem solving bit... not so much.",1395169060

It&#x27;s actually not a bad language -- with a modern IDE it&#x27;s actually pretty quick and breezy to work with.<p>If the standard library was cleaned up and the warts were all removed and filled in, even if it broke compatibility (call it Java X or the Latte language or something) I&#x27;d be okay with that. There&#x27;s too much old 90&#x27;s cruft hanging around making usage of different pieces non-standard and lots of over-objectizing everything so you end up having to assemble lots of things out of little pieces, boilerplate-like, that should just be a single import and instantiation.<p>The modern JVM is surprisingly quick and robust technology and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it in my limited tests. I ported some old Perl algorithms to it and got some really good speed out of it once I benchmarked some of the collections a little.<p>Some things should just be outright fixed, like a proper regex literal so I don\\\\&#x27;t have to \\\\e\\\\s\\\\ca\\\\\\p\\\\\\\\e everything so much\\\\\\\\\\//\\/\\\\.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;got good bones&quot; and a refurb of the entire thing to bring it focus could breath a lot of long-term life into it.<p><i>edit</i><p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is it would be great if the language was informed a bit more with what&#x27;s going on in the dynamic languages space like Go has been.

Which mostly only happens for unrealistic scenarios.<p>As stated, the problem assumes that time lookup isn&#x27;t important, even though someone who wants a BST almost certainly chose it to get faster than linear lookup along with fast insert/delete operations and ordered searches. (Otherwise, why not use a hash table?) A self-balancing tree gives that additional guarantee, and in that case an array-based data storage won&#x27;t be &quot;desperately inefficient&quot;.<p>Indeed I suspect an array will be competitive or even better than an object based version, where each object has its own pointer overhead and associated memory fragmentation.<p>At the very least, the early AVL work in the 1960s used a tape for storage, and I suspect they didn&#x27;t waste all that much tape space.<p>So someone&#x27;s intuition from real-world use of BSTs might end up giving you a false negative.",1395168770

Even if they were paying attention to the transponders themselves, they might figure it was some sort of technical trouble--as long as the aircraft stays in the corridor, who cares? Some idiot flying along an established route without his transponder is a problem for ATC, not air defense, and that seems to be the best explanation for #1 and #3, probably even #2. Sure, Vietnam noticed and tried to inform Malaysia, but countries upstream from the route might not have cared (they probably wouldn&#x27;t have seen it turn, either).<p>But you&#x27;re right, Malaysia hasn&#x27;t done a stellar job organizing the search and recovery (understatement of the year aware goes to...). The real problem, though, is that no one has any idea what&#x27;s going on.<p>I admit. There&#x27;s something fantastical to consider about a plane, under control of a rogue pilot (or pilots), clandestinely flying to a location for possible future use in an elaborate terror plot. The only caveat is that the logistics of such a thing would require so much preliminary planning in terms of fueling, storing/hiding the plane somewhere, or outright repainting it, that it very nearly requires the resources of a state actor or another determined (and secretive) foe. And who would be the target? The simplest solution, then, is to speculate that there was some sort of emergency on board, the pilots became confused (or incapacitated and the plane was operating on autopilot), and the aircraft is now at the bottom of the sea.<p>Returning to the article: It&#x27;s easy to blame countries near the Indian Ocean of being highly secretive about their capabilities. I&#x27;m sure they are, of course, (and certainly need to be) but there&#x27;s something about the elaborate hijacking plot that seems amazingly complicated and difficult to pull off. Moreover, as time wears on, the probability of being discovered increases, and I&#x27;m sure other states (Israel) might be keeping an eye on potential suspects (Iran) for such activity anyway, simply out of paranoia. Further, how easy is it to disappear a plane and keep it hidden for weeks, months, or indefinitely? One instance [1] comes to mind, but with 239 people on board...? That&#x27;s to say nothing about finding a runway large enough to land such a beast that is <i>also</i> not well monitored.<p>I&#x27;ll say this: It&#x27;d make great fiction, certainly, but I think the crux of the matter is something we don&#x27;t do well as humans. We don&#x27;t like to admit that we don&#x27;t know the answer. And this could become the <i>mystery of the century</i> if it&#x27;s never found. However, I&#x27;m inclined to believe it was an emergency of some sort (at least I hope). But, the only thing that doesn&#x27;t mesh well with that theory is the engine monitoring data, but we might very well discover there was a valid reason for that (incapacitated pilots?).<p>For the sake of the families, I hope something is discovered soon--if only for closure. I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine the pain they&#x27;re feeling not knowing what became of their loved ones.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N844AA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N844AA</a>",1395168297

I filed for these as a part of my employment for IBM a long time ago (around 1988), and by now all of my IBM patents have expired.  When I left IBM to start my own company I invented more than I did at IBM, but I chose to license our technology to the Open Software Foundation instead of patenting it.<p>Part of my thinking in not filing for patents was that the big companies that were our biggest competitors (IBM, HP, Sun, DEC) wouldn&#x27;t be slowed down by patents.  They had armies of lawyers and big portfolios of patents and inventions that would be used against us if we tried to enforce any of our patents against them.  Whether or not any of their claims were valid, we would not have been able to afford the legal battle and would have been forced to cross-license with them anyway.<p>Patent protection for software has always bothered me. Patents that made sense in the days of steam engines just don&#x27;t work well for software.  Patents give too much protection (preventing independent discovery of some idea from being used) and last too long, way too long for the software industry (I think 4 years is plenty of time to get exclusive use for an idea in software).<p>Ideally, I would like to see patent protection to software eliminated and replaced with a much easier to obtain protection for a couple of years. Or, use copyright protection for software.  Copyright protection is sensible since it protects the programs from being stolen while allowing the ideas to be used by others if they do an independent implementation.",1395167909

A member of the Dogecoin community donated 14 million Dogecoins (worth about US$11,000 on the exchanges) to a charity with one single message on Twitter. That tweet, to an automated Twitter-bot, is the most money ever donated or sent directly via a tweet.<p>The Dogecoins were for Doge4Water, a charity set up to help people in Kenya get clean drinking water. The Dogecoins will be converted to real money, and that money will be used to build new wells. The tweet, by an anonymous person who goes by @savethemhood, helped to push the Doge4Water to well past its 40 million Dogecoin (US$30,000) goal. The charity had hoped to reach it by March 22nd, which is World Water Day, and it met that target with a week to spare.<p>This isn’t the first time the Dogecoin community showed its charitable nature. Last month it raised enough money to help get the broke Jamaican Bobsled Team (yes, that one) to the Sochi Winter Olympics. The generosity makes sense, as Dogecoin is positioned to be the “tipping currency” of the Internet.<p>For a crypto-currency that was started as something of a joke, Dogecoin is doing some good, and part of that is through the sheer number of Dogecoin users. By volume, it’s the most-traded crypto-currency in the world. Part of that is because it’s so easy and cheap to get into. A person can buy-in for as little as a dollar (US$1 is worth about 1300 Dogecoins at the time this post went live), and the tipping culture is rife within the community. For example, on the Dogecoin sub-reddit, users are encouraged to tip one another small amounts of Dogecoin for insightful or positive comments along with “upvotes” (the quasi-currency of Reddit).<p>The Dogecoin community has the aim of expanding that “tipping” culture to the rest of the internet by keeping the price of Dogecoin artificially low. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is not meant to be an investment currency, so much of the shiftiness that Bitcoin users have had to endure likely won’t make its way to the Dogecoin world (though that’s not to say it’s immune).<p>Still, there’s always going to be some controversy with crypto-currencies, and besides being used as a force for good for bobsledders and Kenyan villagers, Dogecoin, with its catch phrases, such as “wow” and “such currency” and “so crypto”, could be a great way to explore what these new virtual currencies can and can’t do, all while maintaining a sense of humor.",1395167188

7423834,comment,7419553,7422616,2,0,copx,,,">I&#x27;m the earliest developer still full-time on the Rust language (4+ years) and I was exclusively using Mac OS X from the beginning. If you look at Servo, Mac is actually better supported than Linux at the moment.<p>You mean XCode and the rest of Apple&#x27;s developer tools have great Rust support? There are up to date Cocoa bindings? \nThat would be real Mac support.<p>I know that many Linux people switched to Mac OS X because it has this whole POSIX system underneath its chrome, which normal Mac users never touch, but which makes an adequate Linux replacement + you get the nice Mac desktop OS on top of that. But as I said I do not see how running ports of Linux tools on that layer qualifies as real Mac support.<p>>What feedback is that?<p>Different types of software get developed for Windows, trying to use Rust in these different scenarios might have exposed issues specific to said use cases. Demanding PC games are overwhelmingly developed on and for Windows for starters. And there is also the issue of &quot;cultural incest&quot;. There are certain hegemonic attitudes among UNIX developers about how thinks should work, how they should be organized, named etc. Attitudes which are often not shared by other developer communities. However, the early development of C++ happened in a UNIX dominated environment too so maybe this will not be that problematic.<p>>you talk about a binary installer. That&#x27;s not something we have on any platform yet.<p>The thing is, just dropping source tarballs on people is considered acceptable among UNIX developers, that is the way you do things there. But it is not the way you do things on Windows.<p>>Of course I would, if they were competent developers.<p>The issue is not technical competence, but &quot;cultural competence&quot; if you will. Building software people on platform X actually want to use, which requires respecting the cultural norms. You just gave a nice example of lacking cultural competence by assuming that not providing a binary installer which does not require manual twiddling is just as acceptable on Windows as on Linux, while it really sends a bad message on Windows and leads to Windows developers never bothering with Rust at all. It is like, nobody on Windows has a problem with closed source drivers .. but the Linux devs hate those.. bad culture fit. It matters, a lot.<p>>There are tons of popular C++ package managers: Homebrew and apt-get, to name a couple.<p>apt-get is the Debian package manager, Homebrew is for UNIX devs using the POSIX layer of OS X, neither is a &quot;C++ package manager&quot;. These pieces of software are OS specific tools and have no direct relation to the C++ programming language at all.<p>>That is also precisely what Rust does.<p>Well, that is great. However, I remain highly skeptical. I can already see the install instruction for Rust libraries on Github etc. &quot;Cargo install foobar&quot;, no word about how to build the library without Cargo, the dependencies are only specified in Cargo metadata files etc. Plus as I said package managers encourage developers to write software with lots of dependencies .. which becomes a pain to build without said package manager. While in theory Cargo may be optional, I doubt it will be in practice. The whole Rust ecosystem will grow based on the assumption that everyone uses Cargo, and everyone who does not will be in for a world of pain. Other languages who have official package managers show this.<p>>Mozilla is not going to invest in a language that won&#x27;t work on Windows, for obvious reasons.<p>There is a big difference between being able to turn your particular code base into Windows binaries and actually providing a good development experience on Windows. The first does not necessarily require the second. I think most (all?) Mozilla devs use a UNIX-style development environment, even if Windows is the dominant target platform.<p>>First-class support for Windows is evident everywhere in the design, from the use of libuv instead of libevent for the green threading to the lack of exposure of `select` or `fork` due to that not performing well on Windows.<p>Again, I was mostly talking about the developer experience, not about the ability to somehow build fast binaries. That is expected too of course, but not enough for the &quot;first class&quot; label in my book.<p>>To what? Abandoning the package manager?<p>Yes. See above for the reasons why. When I build my C++ software on Linux I do not need a special &quot;C++ package manager&quot;. I just apt-get the dependencies (e.g. SDL). Does Rust really need something more? As I said, I think a language specific package manager will undermine Rust&#x27;s ability to be a general C++ replacement.<p>>and somewhat insulting<p>I did not mean to insult anyone. I want Rust to succeed, that is my only agenda here. I think you are on the wrong track with this and thus I wanted to warn you about it. Maybe I am completely wrong, we will see. I will not bother you again, because as a Windows game developer Rust is dead to me now.<p>Maybe I will look at it again once I read about the first major game written in Rust being released, which will probably be somewhere between 5 years from now and never. But right now my money is on never.",1395166576

For comparison, about 122 petawatts are absorbed from the sun, the Earth&#x27;s fiery core generates about 45 terawatts, and humans currently produce around 16 terawatts.  So the Earth is absorbing hundreds of petawatts, radiating hundreds of petawatts, and the tiny, tiny surplus of 200 terawatts is slowly heating the Earth (mostly the oceans).<p>Incidentally, this heat gain could be counteracted by dumping about 12 cubic miles of ice into the ocean each day.

For those of us who have never had to do a BST before (I do not have a degree in CS, though I&#x27;ve been coding professionally for 8 years), expecting us to solve a BST problem in the 10, 15 minutes alotted is not really great. Even if I&#x27;ve never seen it before, the idea that I can solve it in 15 minutes in a high pressure environment is unrealistic.<p>In a real world scenario, if I had to solve this kind of thing, I&#x27;d rely on existing works first. I&#x27;d google the problem, and I&#x27;d see what solutions are out there. For <i>most</i> problems, there&#x27;s <i>something</i> that can point me in the right direction.<p>For solving a BST issue from scratch in 15 minutes, well.. let&#x27;s just say the first guy to come up with BSTs probably didn&#x27;t come up with his solution in 15 minutes.<p>So I would give it my best shot, but if I don&#x27;t succeed, you shouldn&#x27;t hold it against me. I disagree with the premise that if I can&#x27;t solve this, I can&#x27;t solve novel problems. That&#x27;s just blatantly incorrect. I solve novel problems every day -- just not on a whiteboard and not in 15 minutes.<p>I would <i>much much much</i> rather see a real-world problem. Something you&#x27;ve actually run into. For instance, in my line of work, I deal a lot with addresses. One of the issues that I&#x27;ve had to solve in the past is parsing addresses.

It&#x27;s something that anyone with critical thinking skills can take a decent shot at in 15 minutes. A binary search algorithm? I got a question like this one time, and I floundered because I got 90% of the way there, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to solve one of those edge cases. The guy basically ended the interview right there, but I asked for the solution. When he gave it to me, it was something straight out of an academic textbook.<p>I said, &quot;Oh, you guys must use binary trees a lot.&quot; And he laughed and said, &quot;No, never. It&#x27;s low-level stuff for databases.&quot;<p>And I just sat there, dumbstruck. Why would you give me a problem that you&#x27;ve never had to solve yourself?<p>I dunno. I just disagree with the premise of the article. I think there are far better questions to ask. Problem solving in general is required -- solving academic exercises much less so.",1395165835

7423719,comment,7422954,7422954,1,0,darkpicnic,,,"I&#x27;ve been using Nitrous for three months now. Here&#x27;s why I stick with it:<p>1) I don&#x27;t code offline any more. I have too many languages I work with and there&#x27;s too many points of failure that can be easily fixed with a Google search or StackOverflow. If I&#x27;m offline, it&#x27;s usually a waste of time and most likely, I should be taking a walk.<p>2) Having a dev environment that is remote means my computer can completely fail and in 5 min, I&#x27;m deploying production code again. It means I can move between machines without ANYTHING being different. Leave your work computer at work, work from a friend&#x27;s computer, yours, it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>3) You actually have control over your box resources. Cloud9 boxes were abysmally slow, even though their editor was better. Koding was way too focused on social and attempting to do too much. Nitrous is simple and fast.<p>That being said, here is what Nitrous needs to work on:<p>1) Uptime has been sub-par. They&#x27;ve had problems, especially with US-East, that have led to me not being able to work. This has been minimal, but enough to make me concerned.<p>2) The editor is very minimal. There is no fuzzy searching for files (like in Sublime), no auto-complete, no code hinting, no error checking other than really basic stuff, like indentation in Python or broken div tags in HTML. Having dabbled with Cloud9&#x27;s editor, which is fantastic, I def think they need to focus on this.<p>3) Collaborative editing seems half-baked. Each user has to open the same file and then press a button &quot;Collab Mode&quot;. If either forgets to press the button, your editing different files. There&#x27;s also no sharing of console output, so this means if you are running a script that you are both working on, you both cannot see the same console output. Probably a pretty tricky problem to overcome, so I don&#x27;t totally blame them.<p>All and all, still really like the service and hope they keep improving.",1395165645

Requesting feature permissions that aren't used visibly is terrible practice.<p>I think Apple got this particular policy right: their review process screens apps to make sure that visibly requested information is visibly used for something in the application, preventing every application from asking users for every bit of their personal information just to launch the app. In my experience the actual execution of said policy is spotty and inconsistent like the rest of the review process, but the idea is sound.<p>0:  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10151330596285363"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10151330596285363</a> via <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3637869"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3637869</a>",1330322256

3637909,comment,3637468,3637847,6,0,rogerbinns,,,"Dropbox on Android is pretty pathetic.  It doesn't actually do sync - you get a file browser not too much different than the dropbox web site interface, and can download files one at a time!  You can also choose to upload files although you can't select an entire directory at once.  This is closer to a crappy ftp client than the desktop sync solution everyone is familiar with.  They did however recently just add auto upload of photos and videos.<p>It should be noted that Dropbox on iOS is even worse (same download one file at a time mechanism) since you can only upload photos and videos, rather than any arbitrary content.  Every iOS app that wants Dropbox integration has to add its own code to do all of it.  On Android there is a centralized accounts system where Dropbox, Skype, Linkedin, Facebook and any other app with relevant permissions can publish an account.  Other apps can then access those accounts (without getting the username/password - just a token) so they don't require heavyweight integration.<p>Android doesn't do calendar and contacts like Apple does.  There can be multiple providers and they can each do whatever they want.  For example Google stores those in the cloud, as does Linked and Skype so there is nothing to do to have them in sync.  You can see the union of all relevant providers at once.<p>BTW one huge advantage Android has over iOS is that you do not have to keep re-entering passwords all the time.  It totally bewilders me that iOS users aren't up in arms at how often you have to keep entering it.",1330321176

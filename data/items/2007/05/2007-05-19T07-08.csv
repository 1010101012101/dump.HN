- strong listening skills
- usually politically knowledgeable
- very strong presentation/speaking abilities
- usually strong type ""c"" (logic based behavioral type) rather than type ""d"" (dominant behavioral type), and the exceptional also have some type ""i"" (feelings oriented behavioral type)
- you can see this person doing practically anything in the next 10 years, but whatever they're doing, you can be sure it's out of passion (you'd be surprised to see this person working a job for money)",1179559049

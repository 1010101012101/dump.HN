I read the logs, and I am a bit disappointed that the extent of their methods of hiding themselves were so narrow - involving only VPN providers.<p>The old way of doing this was to own a series of boxes around the world and setup your own SOCKS server, ssh forwards etc. You use boxes that are being used internally at small companies for email or web hosting, meaning that there aren't any admins on there looking for weird traffic patterns.<p>You setup a group of servers like that, and chain them together. Symlink all logs to null, and make sure the first box you jump onto is the most unsuspecting (and one that you have most control over).<p>With a group that I was a member of 10+ years ago we would abandon boxes that had a sysadmin that seemed like he knew what he/she was doing (looking at history logs) or boxes that had a lot of user activity on them but not a lot of resources (it only takes one user to wonder why the net connection is slow for the exploit and you to be found ). The best best were to scan for old ftpd's running on old kernels.<p>These were boxes that had been bought and setup for something like email or a small webpage and then forgotten about (usually setup by external IT). You patch the exploit so nobody else can get it, install a backdoor, and not do anything noticeable. We had access to such boxes for <i>years</i> and as far as I know we were never noticed by anybody.<p>VPN providers are constantly monitoring for abuse, and when they get a law enforcement notice they will comply. It is only a matter of time before you get caught if you are using them. I would suspect that law enforcement found out which VPN providers were being used some months ago, and set up honeypots at each one waiting for members of anonymous to reconnect.",1316854662

I have for the past 6+ years.<p>After my third year, essentially on a whim (my sponsor, I think, knows this) I pursued a research fellowship in cardiovascular genetics. I loved it a lot, and stayed on a second year (spontaneously; thank you, Stanley and Lola J. Sarnoff).<p>After my fifth year in medical school, my second year of CV genetics up at MGH and the Broad Institute, I got the opportunity to pursue the startup dream for a year. I'm midway through and absolutely loving it.<p>But yet, I miss medicine. And I think that the grass is always greener, so I think I will miss whatever I'm not doing. Next year, in medical school for the first time in three years, I will miss research. Or I will miss the startup life. Something. I know it, because right now, I miss the hospital.<p>I miss working 80 hours a week while paying $50,000 a year for the privilege. I miss having a best answer (and if you think there are better answers in software than there are in medicine, please email me so I can hire you).<p>But I know that soon, I will miss the freedom of working at a startup. There is no right answer for everyone. And for many of us who were drawn to medicine, I think there can be no possible right answer, ever.",1316854342

There's zounds of experiments that back me up on this.<p>As far people saying it's cheap labor: when residents make mistakes and the hospital gets sued, the labor suddenly isn't so cheap anymore. Again, there is not a doubt in my mind that this practice leads to a lot of damage and death, with the associated financial fallout.<p>That hospital management doesn't try to change this shows how blind they are to the consequences of entrenched practices.

3032823,comment,3026632,3027484,1,0,georgemcbay,,,"""Closures are far more confusing.""<p>IMO (obviously this is subjective) this is not true but it depends upon whether you mean confusing to use or confusing to understand the full implications of a thing under the hood.<p>Closures are pretty easy to start using for just about any halfway decent programmer if you lay off the theoretical underpinnings and just show them: here do this, and this will happen.  Actually understanding <i>how</i> they function is another matter, but to just start using them is fairly simple assuming the language you are using supports them natively.<p>Pointers on the other hand are a fairly simple concept and unlike closures there is really no depth to the concept, but because most people's brains don't deal well with indirection beyond one level, pointers are very ""tricky"" when it comes to training your brain on how to use them correctly even after you understand the concept.<p>Closures are easy to use, hard to grok; pointers are easy to grok, hard to use, so which is more confusing depends a lot on what you mean by confusing.",1316853104

Postgres cannot return data directly from indexes (covering indexes). It always has to go back to the table itself to fetch the actual data. If the table is large, that can be inefficient for some types of queries.<p>Non-transactional tables use a lot less memory as well. For instance, if you have a large table that represents a N:M relationship (id1 int, id2 int), the two ints use 8 bytes of memory. A postgres table adds about 24 bytes per record, three times the actual data, plus some overhead per page.<p>Don't take this to mean that MySQL is faster than Postgres. That's not generally the case. The Postgres query optimizer is vastly better than MySQL's. So for complex queries and data models, Postgres is way superior. The big differences are always related to very specific data model and query combinations, so general benchmarks are utterly useless.",1316852612

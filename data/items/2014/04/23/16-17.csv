7635234,comment,7634825,7634825,14,0,jmzbond,,,"A year ago, I would have thought that the antidote to burnout was start-up culture. I&#x27;m a little less naive about it now.<p>The reality is that you can burnout in any of these ways whether or not you&#x27;re a corporate monkey or a start-up monkey. Substitute vending machines and water coolers for fancy free-for-all-cafes and foosball tables, and many start-ups have similar WORK demands of their employees. In other words, no matter how fun the culture, it can&#x27;t forever mask the fact that you&#x27;re working toward someone else&#x27;s vision and mission.<p>I once thought this would be very different in a company of 50 vs 50,000. But even in start-ups, we suffer from an over-emphasis on specialized activities (for efficiency and scale). This creates jobs that lack ownership of the big picture, and therefore may create short term excitement (if the work or team is interesting), but does not equate to long term passion and fulfillment.<p>As a founder with an idea, part of the reason that I don&#x27;t want to join an existing effort is because I want to build an organization that challenges this model. Is there a way to better distribute ownership of the vision to everyone in the company so that instead of having a bunch of employees working toward your vision, you have a bunch of entrepreneurs collaborating to define that vision? That in my mind is a major part of avoiding burnout.<p>The secondary piece is helping people realize that work/life balance is always necessary. As a founder, I spent one month subscribing to the Valley norm that I should just work constantly. Mentally I was fine, but physically I pinched a nerve (or something) and all kinds of horror happened. Yet this cultural attitude of fast fast fast is so prevalent, I think we should also do more to encourage people to adopt some &quot;slow&quot; principles.",1398272218

Try to treat it logically and it&#x27;s easy to construct Asimov-esque &quot;Laws of Robotics&quot; situations in which the simple formulations, taken literally, create paradoxes quite easily. It is, in my opinion, clearly a rule that one is more meant to follow the spirit of than the letter of the law.<p>That said, I&#x27;d also observe that your rule,&quot;do unto others as they want done to themselves&quot;, is not the same as my point. My point is that &quot;Do unto others as you&#x27;d have them do unto you&quot; itself already encompasses the idea of honoring preferences, on the grounds that you would already like your preferences honored. It isn&#x27;t a free-floating rule that I would advocate you adding to your ethicals on its own, it&#x27;s a second-order consequence of the already-existing Golden Rule.<p>The Golden Rule, while it does not proscribe an exact solution to your hypothetical, at least gives guidance, inasmuch as if you&#x27;d like to live in a just world, it implies that you should approach your hypothetical with justice in mind. Presumably you have not encountered a free-floating, context-free fight between two otherwise identical men who are for some mysterious reason asking you and you alone to resolve the fight in favor of one or the other, with no other options permitted.<p>(I dislike ethical hypotheticals, or at least, I dislike hypotheticals when people lose track of the fact that they are inevitably incredible, massive simplifications of any real situation you might experience. One should either highlight that the hypothetical is deliberately abstracted, in which case math-style logic-chopping is what is called for, or that it is intended to be a real question about a real situation in which case what is called for is almost certainly a logically-complicated set of &quot;if-thens&quot; to flesh out the hypothetical, with general understanding that there is no one &quot;true&quot; answer because there is no one &quot;true&quot; situation being given.)<p>It is, in my opinion, a very thin and perhaps downright sophmoric interpretation of the Golden Rule to read it hyper-literally and incredible &quot;thinly&quot; and apply it only to your own literal preferences about exactly what you&#x27;d like done to you this second. I say this to lay down a marker, not saying that you are necessarily doing that. For instance, it certainly does not mean that if you are hungry right now, your ethical imperative is to go around feeding everybody you see, regardless of their own state. It&#x27;s deeper and richer than that... again, probably not deep and rich enough to be a full ethical system on its own (I don&#x27;t think it is), but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> thin.",1398271490

If you&#x27;d like to get an idea of what the future holds for people, take a look at cows, a creature that has a lot of financial value. The idea is that the cow is tagged to be uniquely identified, when the cow approaches a service center, for say salt or food, the system reads the ID and delivers an appropriate form of nourishment. When the cow is uncomfortable due to lack of milking, the system milks the cow. Next up, I&#x27;m sure, will be automated detection of sick cows along with some basic veterinary interdiction. Finally it would be very easy to add a little bit of behavioral control to the system, either a mild shock, a noise, or some other stimulus to gently train the animal over time. I could even imagine a farm without fences, managed completely by robots and conditioned cows. The cows are happy, the people are happy.<p>Pretty cool. Also a bit unnerving.<p>I don&#x27;t think there needs to be a robot revolt.

The other three (including the CEO who I talked to) are all undergrad business major types who work as tellers at a bank.<p>So HN, what is the smart AND ethical play here?

These guys have zero ability to execute - no one on their team has any experience with web development, entrepreneurship, user acquisition, or anything.<p>I obviously don&#x27;t want to just steal someone&#x27;s idea, but I also don&#x27;t want to split a company 5 ways when I&#x27;m the only one who is bringing any execution. What is a fair way to handle this? Even if the CEO drops the others and we split 50/50, I still feel like I&#x27;m bringing way more value than he is. I understand he could be valuable in non-tech ways, but I have no way to verify that until I see him in action. How can I structure a deal so that we both get what we really deserve out of it?<p>I know consulting a lawyer to set up a fair contract is key, and I plan to.

It&#x27;s difficult, due to the ratcheting pedal mechanism, but it can be wheelied. The Eagle [1], which used conventional pedals (well, conventional compared to the state-of-the-art at that time), can easily wheelie. In fact, my experience has been that one needs to be a little careful not to fall off the back. (Source: member of The Wheelmen [2], an antique bicycle club, since a kid.

So I&#x27;m skeptical that Canary was the first to ride a bicycle on its back wheel.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not to say that Canary wasn&#x27;t an impressive rider. I&#x27;ve put thousands of miles on bicycles from that era, and not only are they difficult to ride well, they&#x27;re so dangerous that there&#x27;s no way they could be sold today (EDIT: come to think of it, everyone I know that has put any serious miles on highwheelers has been seriously hurt at some point, including myself. The 1886 Columbia I currently own I bought from my uncle after it nearly killed him.). Riding down the Capital steps on a highwheeler? Not on my most bold and daring of days.

A rover could be landed on Venus more easily than on Mars, but it would, by necessity, have a very short lifetime on the surface.  Once it&#x27;s out of coolant, the mission is over.  So if you were going to land a rover (or rovers) on the surface of Venus, you&#x27;d need to maximize their effectiveness.  One way to do this would be to teleoperate them in near real-time, which could be done if rover landing were coordinated with a manned flyby.<p>A manned flyby of Venus would be substantially cheaper and less risky than a manned mission to Mars.  There&#x27;s no manned landing component, and the flyby mission itself would take a little over a year, which is pushing the limit for human exposure to micogravity, but within the range that we have actual experience.<p>This kind of mission will, of course, only make sense if you are an advocate of manned space exploration in the first place.",1398270217

And there are plenty of co-ops run by CEOs.<p>And most co-ops do not offer order-of-magnitude improvements in working conditions or pay. You are looking at a 10% type improvement, not a 10x one. The downside of a co-op is that it might have a 10% improvemnet in (potential) conditions, but a poor implenetation but will be -10% as productive due to inefficiencies and execution problems.Which basically runs the risk of zero net improvement for the typical person there.<p>All of which means that you really need to analyze any proposed or actual implementation.

The concern about the post mortem she actually voiced was that the investigation was by an agency paid for by the company. The well known problem with such investigations is that they are rarely seen as being independent and hence, sadly irrespective of their merits of lack of them, they rarely solve the problem because their reports are seen as being tainted. Hence such investigations do not serve to remove the chill she was trying to explain and which you evidently failed to understand.<p>With regard to the apparent imbalance between Horvath and Github and its employees, such an alleged imbalance is fictional. This kind of situation where there is an employee involved in any kind of war of words with a company is indeed rarely balanced but it is rare for it to be truly in favor of the employee. A company has the resources and many means to make its position clear. This starts with engaging a PR / crisis management firm to craft the strategy to be rolled out. It will typically involve and investigation and two classes of public statements. Statements from the company expressing vague regret and apology for any perceived wrong doing. And orchestrated anonymous statements from employees explaining how the situation was more nuanced and how the employee in question was always difficult etc etc.  Just to be clear how typical this pattern is, I predicted precisely this rollout weeks ago and it followed the standard pattern precisely.<p>Please note that I do not have any knowledge of the situation and assume nothing about what did or didn&#x27;t happen. I do however recognize that precisely that uncertainty, if not properly handled after the effect can indeed have a chilling effect. It is for that reason that I believe the original post had merit.<p>Please further note that my concern with your comment is because you mindlessly trot out stereotyped generalities about the unfairness of the ways men and women are treated in the workplace. The same tired old shibboleth&#x27;s about how women are inevitably considered blameless and right and men villainous perpetrators whatever the facts.<p>As for me being surprised by your insight that women too can have negative sides to their personalities - grow up.",1398269730

Rather, its members are its owners.<p>So, in the case of a worker cooperative, the people who work for the business are its member-owners.  (In the case of a consumer cooperative, its patrons are its member-owners.)<p>What are some benefits of cooperative businesses?<p>For one thing, because the business is not beholden to outside shareholders, who typically only have an interest in the <i>financial</i> health of the company, it can make decisions that a for-profit company might not be at liberty to make.<p>For instance, a for-profit bank, under shareholder pressure, might introduce sneaky hidden fees to increase its bottom line -- but at the expense of irritating its patrons.  That just wouldn&#x27;t happen with a credit union (a form of cooperative), because the investors and patrons are one in the same, and their interests are aligned.<p>Another big benefit, and this is especially true with tech companies, is that the member-owners are invested in the company&#x27;s success in a way that mere employees are not -- and they have the decision-making power to actually influence how the company operates, because coops are democratically controlled.  A lot of tech companies grant stock options and offer profit-sharing programs, but stock options can be a crap shoot (there are a <i>lot</i> of ways for them to end up being worthless, even when the company is profiting handsomely), and profit-sharing doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean power-sharing.<p>There are two major downsides to operating a business as a coop, though.  One is that you have to raise all of your capital from your members, rather than relying on outside investment.  That can be really tough, especially when you&#x27;re just starting out.<p>The other downside is regulatory.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works in other countries, but in the U.S., there are a lot of restrictions and hoops you have to jump through.  For instance, consumer cooperatives must restrict membership based on some type of common bond -- a geographic area or an alumni association, for instance.  But some types of businesses just don&#x27;t flourish unless you open them up to everyone.  This is less of a problem, though, for worker cooperatives.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of the cooperative movement, and the broader distributist movement (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism</a>), and I wish more people knew about the benefits coops offer.",1398269519

The police response does not prevent the station from losing money.  It just prevents the same people from committing the same offense many times in a row.<p>The reason you have to pre-pay now when you didn&#x27;t before is that pay-at-the-pump points of sale make it possible to require it without losing business.  Stations that had prepay-at-the-pump could lower their prices below stations that did not.  The stations that did not have pre-pay did not die off because all the competition was in the same boat, using the same technology and exposed to the same risk.<p>You can&#x27;t avoid those economics.  Your pay-by-BitCoin technical solution has to be the same order of magnitude time-wise on verifying the payment as credit card terminals.  At the least, your transfer should be verified by the time the customer is filled up and ready to drive off.<p>As such, the solution should probably be to take a big transaction to activate the pump, verify it while the pump is running, and issue a refund transaction for the unused amount after that verification and before the customer drives away.   If the transaction fails due to a double spend, the person might still be on the premises long enough for an employee to request an alternate form of payment.

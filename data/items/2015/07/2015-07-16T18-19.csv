To pretend that a huge population doesn&#x27;t give a shit about water usage is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. I agree that California is not the model of water preservation considering the climate and water available to the geography. When statistics point to the fact that only a fraction of the water used in California occurs from lifestyle behavior, stating that the issue is lifestyle changes is failing to take into account any other information than pure speculation. The numbers regarding agricultural usage vary, but in most cases the amount used by things other than directly attributable to people is far less when compared to agriculture or any other source of usage[1].<p>The lifestyle changes that would need to occur to stem California&#x27;s water usage are far more extensive and could easily qualify as a scientific dilemma. Basically non-california citizens are the &quot;problem&quot;.

Even the old BBS scene, though a little more populist and accessible to people at home with phone lines and home computers, looks pretty genteel and exclusive by modern standards.<p>The internet sure felt a lot more democratic when issues like DDOS, doxing, spam, child porn distribution (just to name a few) were not that hard to avoid, so measures against them did not feel that urgent. But that atmosphere is <i>directly</i> related to the selective nature of the audience. Things as small as the introduction of AOL users to USENET caused massive upheavals back in the day.

9899080,comment,9897751,9898413,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"> How to do this with lithographic processes is an open question<p>You don&#x27;t, for economic reasons: the latency of chip manufacturing, i.e. time from initial wafer to finished, is already on the order of weeks. Producing more layers lithographically is going to multiply that latency. Not to mention that it would be a nightmare in terms of yield/manufacturing defects.<p>What <i>is</i> doable (and already done, I believe) is producing multiple chips in parallel and then stacking them on top of each other. Don&#x27;t think cores spread across multiple layers; think alternating layers of cores and caches, or a layer of cores with layers of memory stacked on top. (This approach doesn&#x27;t have the yield problem because you can test the chips <i>before</i> you stack them together. It&#x27;s a technology that is going to see a lot of improvement still.)<p>Heat transfer is still a problem, though, simply because the number of transistors scales with the volume, i.e. cubically in the &quot;radius&quot;, while the surface area available for heat transfer only scales quadratically.<p>P.S.: When chip people talk about &quot;metal layers&quot;, they mean the layers of <i>wiring</i> (also called the BEOL, back-end-of-line). So increasing the number of metal layers does not actually increase the number of transistors. Also, when chip companies talk about &quot;using N layers&quot; in their current technology, that does <i>not</i> mean that N transistors are stacked on top of each other. It means that there is one layer of transistors, and N layers for connecting wires above.",1437071773

In the US you do not have 100% freedom of speech. If you deliberately incite violence against another person through speech, you can be charged with a crime. You can face a lawsuit for assault without touching the victim. You can be charged for, say, harassing others in the workplace. You certainly have the right to speak your mind, but if you think you have the right to deliberately cause severe mental distress, not through mere discussion of your points, but through repetitive and abusive language and getting your cohorts to join you in the assault, you are absolutely mistaken. Even if we were to assume some enshrined right to harass individuals, perhaps it&#x27;s not the best way to go about a disagreement.<p>Further, people are choosing to get angry over the false binary of freedom vs harassment, and choosing to ignore the third option of choosing empathy, tact, or clear and fair discussion over slinging barbs at others.<p>I&#x27;m reading comments along the lines of &#x27;well, it couldn&#x27;t have been <i>that</i> bad&#x27; or &#x27;I don&#x27;t know enough about the extent of the harassment, but I&#x27;m going to comment about semantics or the 100 percent accuracy [as opposed to, say, 90 percent] of her claims anyway!&#x27; Your comments are pointless and dance around the actual issue of abuse. You fail to feel any sort of empathy because you yourself are not the victim.<p>I hear people making fun of the concept of &#x27;microaggression&#x27; because they fail to adequately understand its meaning. The point is that it&#x27;s really easy to throw a one-line insult to someone, but in aggregate it can cause great distress, because the throwaway comments of a thousand people can feel like one very persistent stalker. People dismiss this by saying &#x27;oh it&#x27;s normal&#x27; and recommend they just ignore it. Frankly, the point is that it should not be normal, and some people have difficulty ignoring it.<p>And I know some will deliberately choose to misconstrue what I&#x27;m saying here. No, I&#x27;m not saying that we should censor the Internet and ban all controversial discussion.

The majority of people are not that smart and cannot make thoughtful contributions to most discussions. The majority of people will at least some of the time lose decorum and make vicious personal attacks when they perceive themselves as being threatened or as being wronged. Upvoting and downvoting is an action, and action requires motivation. Thus, unless an audience is especially smart and valuing of rationality, comments are most likely to get upvotes when they provoke an emotional reaction.<p>To have a high quality discussion board you must have a critical mass of reasonable, smart people. You must avoid letting in the hoi polloi. And you must quickly ban users who make dumb comments or violate decorum.<p>However, most internet business models are based on advertising. Advertising revenues are based on eyeballs. And a normal stupid person&#x27;s eyeballs are worth just as much as smart person&#x27;s eyeballs (perhaps more, the smart person probably has adblock installed).<p>Thus the central conflict. Business models are based on making it as easy as possible for normal people to get engaged in the platform. But the result of normal people getting engaged will be vicious and unsavory content. Also if it is easy to create account, then it is easy to switch accounts if one account is banned. So it becomes impossible to silence the unsavory users.<p>I think that ultimately Reddit will end up as sort of the Wikipedia version of a newspaper. All pretense of being free speech or democratic will be dropped in the major subreddits. Rather it will be a media site on a variety of issues that is mostly top-down, and controlled by the actions of entrenched, established users and moderators.",1437070761

GPUs are essential very wide data word processors (one instruction but a large data vector).<p>And, there are also configurable pipeline processors that consist of multiple ALUs (can be vector data) with reconfigurable connections between them. So rather than eat the overhead of generic bit LUTs in an FPGA, you reconfigure the interconnect in a fabric of ALUs. The fabric can contain specialized ALUs (or execution units), and varying densities depending on typical usage. This avoids a the technology mapping and place & route of FPGA design. Translating a description of hardware (HDL) into actual lookup table data is a massive compute problem for large modern FPGAs. However, if we collapse the routing to just data buses between compute units, the problem can be solved in real-time. This way, a compute pipeline could be reorganized by an application at run-time without using a full-fledged hardware description language with all kinds of very low-level constructs. Higher-level language compilers already exist for this kind of architecture in academia.<p>EDIT: The sea of ALUs can also contain memories, FIFOs, and other block elements. However, they would all operate on the same word size to reduce the routing problem and allow maximum density implementation.<p>In fact, this is the essence of how micro-coded instructions in a modern CPU work anyway--instruction &#x27;scheduling&#x27; is basically figuring out how to route data transfers in a sea of execution units.<p>The article &quot;Fundamental Underpinnings of Reconfigurable Computing Architectures&quot; in the March 2015 Proceedings of the IEEE contains a wonderful introduction to all these concepts.",1437070410

If not, wrap the whole thing around her neck and throw her under the bus (reminds you of the Bourne Trilogy deson&#x27;t it), then come riding in on a white horse to &quot;save&quot; reddit from &quot;chairman Pao&quot;.<p>And so far, it&#x27;s working perfectly. The &quot;trolls&quot; celebrate their victory by having the sensationalist media blast them on their sexism, Pao&#x27;s reputation is utterly destroyed and she&#x27;s essentially too toxic to employ anywhere, and Reddit still gets to wipe the floor with free speech.",1437069785

It&#x27;s as embarrassingly hokey and strident as Christian evangelists self-describing as &quot;spiritual warriors.&quot; It would be just as annoying to have all Christians dismissively labeled as &quot;spiritual warriors&quot; for their belief.<p>Framing advocacy as warfare is inaccurate and unwise. Appealing to people with your arguments and example and negotiating points of agreement are huge parts of effective advocacy.<p>Defining people as opponents to kill, disable or dominate isn&#x27;t effective advocacy - and recent wars might even indicate that they aren&#x27;t focuses for effective warfare, either. Furthermore, it tells your &quot;opponents&quot; that the only way to deal with you is to suppress you by force. When people get locked obsessively into these conflicts beyond reconciliation, it&#x27;s sick and self-perpetuating rather than cathartic and it doesn&#x27;t help anybody.",1437069697

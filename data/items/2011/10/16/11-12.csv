During my last searches I encountered all the points you mention in Utrecht/NL, I hear comparable things about Amsterdam , Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg or Paris.<p>So, welcome to a european capital! 1 hour travel to work, 5th floor without lift is the way to go: older houses far outside of the big cities. The suburbs are already filled with locals who do not want/cannot afford to live in the centers. I'm completely unaware of the situation in Denmark, but just looking on google maps tells me that maybe Roskilde or Farum could be places to look for.<p>Also: you move to another country: other habits. If it's the situation on the housing market I cannot tell, but the million ways of being (un)friendly or (not) answering mails/letters, dealing with business transactions etc are the things which makes relocating difficult at heart, they are not just annoyances. I live in ""another"" country for some 20 years and will move to another one this month: I expect (and already experienced) a lot of impedance mismatches which could trigger a ""considered harmful"" post, but in the end I will have to adapt to enjoy the good things of it.<p>Good luck anyway!",1318766084

You just approached it terribly -- Copenhagen is not in America, and different places have different ways of doing things. You can't just expect foreign cultures to play by your rules. You have to do your research and find out how the locals do it. I got to see several nice apartments and they were decently priced, and am spending approx. 10% of my monthly wage on rent.<p>""Donating half of my paycheck to the taxman in order to live in a city overpriced by any measure is one thing.""<p>Copenhagen has some of the highest wages in Europe.

You'll find out when you launch something.<p>Price is also a way to pick your customers. You want to deal with people who have money and value your product, or critical, complaining cheapskates and ingrates? Pushing yourself to lower your price pushes you to commodify your product and strip out what might be creating all the value.<p>You can also A/B test your pricing on your landing pages to graph out a demand curve for your service that will let you optimize your pricing to maximize yield, but I think pricing based on value creation and cost of substitutes is a better way to go.",1318765917

Then I realized that, in the real world, sometimes backups fall by the wayside.<p>It shouldn't happen, and for the people responsible for the loss of this data, it never should have.  Again though, it's easy to see how caffeine induced coding sessions end up with tons of code and not much else.  Those tons of code are PRODUCT, and they're building it.  The idea of burglary sounds so far-fetched that it's always easy to put off til tomorrow. And backups took _time_, and _effort_.  Time and effort that would have taken away from coding.  From building.<p>Nowadays though, between Github, Dropbox, or any of the million completely painless ways to back up your code, it seems even more egregious that something like this can happen.<p>Admittedly, I use Dropbox as a convenience more than anything.  So that I know a core set of files are available to me no matter what computer I'm on, but it was very natural to fall into the habit of making sure that 'important' documents went in there as well.<p>If I had to throw this laptop out the window and never see it again, I'd feel relatively assured that between Dropbox and Chrome, I wouldn't lose anything important.

I finally decided to get a prepaid SIM and start calling people, and suddenly things became much easier.<p>The person who I eventually rented an apartment from explained that she placed the ad in the morning, went to work, and received my call (and a few others) before she returned home to read her e-mail, which contained over 100 replies.   The people who called already had appointments to see the apartment, so she wasn't even going to look at the mails unless those people were uninterested.  She also remarked that she could tell from our brief initial conversation that I seemed like a nice person, which helped my chances; she doesn't get that benefit from an email conversation.<p>Looking at it from a potential landlord's point of view, it makes sense that calling an ad that has just been placed is going to have the highest success rate; not everyone checks their mail as often as tech-minded people.",1318765278

It's much easier to find an apartment in the greater Copenhagen area: Frederiksberg, Albertslund, Ballerup, Brndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Greve Strand, Herlev, Hvidovre, Ishj, Lyngby-Taarbk, Rdovre, Sllerd, Trnby, Vallensbk, Vrlse.<p>I am surprised, however, that your employer hasn't given you any references, tips, or even subsidized housing.

3117106,comment,3116120,3116120,4,0,tluyben2,,,"I travel between 3 countries, one of which is Spain. It really makes life a lot better; in the south of Spain people are so incredibly more relaxed that you first get frustrated with that, but rapidly take over that life style as being frustrated doesn't make much sense. Example: you can be in the supermarket, in a queue behind the cash register and no-one sitting there. You look outside and he/she is standing talking with the neighbor. 10 people in front of you waiting. The foreigners/vacation goers sighing, grunting, annoying and just going away after a while, the people who live here just talking. Doesn't matter if it takes 1 minute or 2 hours. People don't care. And yes they have jobs, but it's so ingrained to work like that...<p>Another example; you're driving on a one car road and suddenly end up in a jam, you check what it is ; someone is standing still and talking to someone. No honking, people shut their engine and go talk to each other.<p>This way of life makes you realize what kind of crazy stuff we are doing 'up north'; like every second matters. It does, but not for work. For work, really very little matters. Your clients can wait for a bit. That site that 'must go live tomorrow' really doesn't have to go live tomorrow in almost all cases. If you live 3 months/year in Spain, you'll be well rested and viewing the world more for what's important which are things like rest, your family (however configured), your friends, eating and making quality food, hobbies, and telling people to <i>fuck off</i> for trying to stress you out.<p>No amount money is worth wrecking your health over and in some cultures they know that; we seem to have forgotten.",1318765180

Being colleagues with other 1st generation Ghanaians, Nigerians, Haitians, and Jamaicans it is a recurring issue amongst the black community. Where 1st gen children who keep their culture of origin do well academically (if their culture demands it) but subsequent generations absorb more of the african-american culture which shuns academia. An example, my neighborhood highschool had enough left in the annual budget to fix the leaking roof in the science wing. The parents petitioned the schoolboard to have the money used to buy new football bleachers. This is the type of culture the students and teachers are up against.<p>The US has a long, and controversial, history with genetics and eugenics research. Most researchers have been wise to avoid it because, realistically, it is a career ender. Unless you enjoy your research being lumped in with propaganda spouted by racist and facist you'd be wise to not go there.",1318763337

He's not an idiot, he knows the odds are against him, but his buying lottery tickets doesn't have any impact on his lifestyle, and it lets him imagine that one day he might win big.<p>He wouldn't notice any difference in his financial situation if he stopped buying the tickets, so really the only downside is that, if he keeps buying them over a twenty year period, the inheritance that comes to myself and my two siblings when he dies will be a bit less. But if you think that way, his quitting the lottery would make a far smaller difference than if he didn't subscribe to extremely expensive sports channels, if he didnt spend £40/week on cigarettes, and so on. I'd far rather see him enjoy his money than save it for my sake - I'll get by fine either way.<p>Sure, for some people the amount they spend on lottery tickets does take away from money they could spend on other stuff, but there are people who are well off enough to be able to afford the cost, without being so well off that winning the lottery isn't a dream they enjoy having.",1296745123

While RDF certainly isn't all that the idealists claim, you can still get some benefit of it without strong AI.<p>Mainly, it provides a consistent model for handling the notion of a ""field"". Non-RDF apis typically return fielded JSON or XML, the structure of which is only specified within the documentation. In order to integrate two services not originally designed to inter-operate, you have to write lots of custom glue code.<p>RDF is at least amenable to writing generic ""rules"" to govern field mapping and inference, rather than one-off glue code (which usually ends up being a hacky script). So sure, if you're integrating one service, a hacky script is probably easier. But if you want a coherent <i>system</i> for integrating large numbers of services not originally designed to inter-operate, RDF makes things a lot easier.<p>So there's some benefit, even if it isn't as dramatic as its proponents claim.<p>Plus, there's the fact that while strong AI isn't yet on the horizon, RDF is a lot easier for weak AI (inference engines, data mining, etc) to ingest, and weak AI is getting better all the time.<p>Actually, one of the biggest problems with RDF, to my mind, is that it's structure makes it very difficult to get good performance with truly large numbers of subjects and attributes - and unfortunately that's just the area where it'd be most useful.",1296744565

There are no semantics baked-in, and you can write arbitrary subject -> predicate -> object triplets to express any possible relationship. To an idealist, it's the perfect format for exposing all the structured data on the web in a machine readable form. The dream has always been for automatic agents to crawl the semantic web for you, understanding the meanings of the RDF triplets, and using them to reason out the solution to your query.<p>To a pragmatist, that dream has always sounded like a bunch of bull. Absent the presence of strong AI, it's a complete pipe dream that a piece of software will ever be able to infer the ""semantic meaning"" of interlinked RDF, just because it happens to be defined by triples. At the end of the day, you're going to have a programmer writing rules against specific terms in RDF, and if that's the case, than RDF is nothing more than an <i>extremely</i> awkward API.<p>Fortunately for the web, the pragmatists won. APIs are everywhere, and RDF is nowhere.<p>Unless strong AI happens to be right around the corner, the web dodged a real bullet there. Personally, I'm of the opinion that any web agent that could possibly puzzle through RDF triplets should have no problem understanding our APIs, in any case.",1296743705

For a single person, that maxes out at $400-600/mo, depending on what part of the UK you live in.<p>For cash benefits, there is a jobseeker's allowance, which you can receive if you show you're actively seeking work, participate in some mandatory programs to do so, and have a mandatory progress meeting every two weeks (and meet some other miscellaneous requirements that keep getting added). That has a max of about $100/wk for a single person.",1296742654

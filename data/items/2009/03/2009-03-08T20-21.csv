(Ive lost my link to the research done into our genetics that shows we did not all come from 2 common ancestors but I know some was done somewhere)<p>Mastering the genome has long been my marker for true mastery of our race. But (and this is directed at the OP) I wouldnt like to seeanyone overly mess with it. We'd have to be damned certain we knew it inside out before tampering with it that heavily.<p>On the other hand they are tampering with genes in mice etc. to try and cure diseases (and Folding@Home is investing a LOT of time modelling protein creation to help move things along :)).",1236545996

One of the last things we setup before launch (literally 2 days before) was replication.<p>This was foolish by us but there was a lot on our plates back in the day. We spent the entire weekend setting up every different replication solution for postgres and in the end I just had to make a judgement call and went to mysql.<p>Luckily we used rails which is pretty agnostic and we have a huge unit test coverage so we could quickly get it ported. We converted the data and launched on MySQL and have been very happy with it ever since.<p>In fact this was a good decision for other reasons as well: the MySQL query cache saved us from having to seriously look at caching for a crucial 3-4 months which we could spend on more important things.<p>On a personal note, i like Postgres much better if it weren't for those issues.",1236545083

You can accomplish the same things in Python with an extra line of overhead.<p>If you want to get this past python-dev you'll need to explain the benefits, here's a start:<p>1) Lower cognitive load: Users can understand blocks but the extra naming/reference is one too many things for their brain stack to handle.<p>2) More descriptive: with blocks the first line says ""I'm about to define a function for use with X"" instead of the existing way which says ""I'm defining a function.  Now I'm using that function with X.""<p>3) Show me: take a chunk of an existing project (stdlib is best) and rewrite it with the proposed block syntax.  You get to cherry pick the example so if the new version doesn't read much cleaner than the old version maybe the idea isn't so hot.<p>I'm -1 on the idea but if you want to change my mind you have to make an argument that doesn't start with ""In Ruby...""",1236544838

Wii sports, and wii play, which come with the hardware have been enough to fill my gimicky urges.  So while it outsells on hardware, I'd hypothesise that it doesn't do so well on games sales, if I'm representative.<p>The content, and services (xbox live) on the other consoles far outweighs anything the wii has offered me.<p>I know the wii has sold a lot of hardware and has been a success reaching the masses, but I think for a substantial number of people, it doesn't offer anything with real depth.  Thats not to say I don't enjoy it, but if all that was available to me was a Wii, I would feel disapointed with this generation of hardware.

That last change was unexpected - I didn't expect they'd decentralize the profile pages that much. A part of me still hopes they'll tie Pages into the user's profile page more - ""Books"" taking you to communities created for each specific book - and I think that would be a good method for them to bring more content holders into the fray, but for whatever reason, I doubt that will actually happen.<p>The process tends to be that a site will unify its design, then break it up more. Facebook is unifying everything right now. The next step would be to find new niches to break the site down into, so they can bring a new fresh feel to the site. Considering they've all-but-abandoned the ""base it on colleges"" design, and now they're moving towards more commercial things, I'm wondering if they'll begin shifting it back again with a new emphasis on networks.

After using linux software RAID and occansionally the expensive 3Ware cards for years, I have decided that the cost and complecation of the RAID system inself also needs to be accounted for.   Sometimes there is downtime directly attributable to the RAID scheme.<p>What I would like to be able to do, is set up two linux servers, such that any change to the file system on one would be writen to the other.  This can be done with inotify and rsync, but I suspect that it would be hard to configure rsync to both have a low enough load on a heavily used database machine and also ""keep up"" enough that the slave system has a consistent snapshot.<p>It would be nice if there were some block-level way of doing this, so that I could have the slave system just be running the OS without the DB server started, and on the master every change that happened to the database data area would be quickly synced on a block level with the slave.  This would remove the database software from the replicaton issue, replication would be handled on a filesystem or directory level, and the database would just have to be configured to sync to disk within a reasonable amount of time.",1236543878

But I think the perception of (mock) organization it provides and its visual similarity to graph paper is what draws people to it.  The power of spreadsheets are in the computations, and of course people use it for that, but I bet there are just as many spreadsheets that contain entirely static content as there exist spreadsheets that actually use spreadsheets as more than just a glorified grid formatting engine.  I've seen people do calculations with desk calculators and then type the results into their spreadsheets.  It does let non-programmers define their own computations, but I wouldn't call what non-programmers do with it to be programming, ""computation for non-programmers"", most definitely.

507482,comment,507358,507358,0,0,chris11,,,"It's somewhat reassuring to know that media companies think p2p should be embraced sometime in the future. But the RIAA's reaction is incredibly shocking for a few reasons.<p>Pirates cost media companies some money.<p>So the RIAA sues people. This is understandable.<p>But they decide to go after more than just damages.
This is also understandable. I mean if you think someone is stealing from you, it's a reasonable reaction not to want to do business with them ever again.<p>They write up a plan to make money off of p2p downloads. This makes sense, piracy is not going to go away. Ok, their survival in the future might depend on making money off of p2p.<p>They decide to wait to implement this plan. This might be understandable if Big Music was just suing pirates for damages, say at max $2 per song.<p>But they are acting like they are trying to shut down p2p right now, so basically they are suing their future customers. So I'm really surprised.<p>If you think of piracy as stealing, think of it like this.
It's like a grocery store owner who has a problem with people stealing produce. He can't stop people from stealing, and if you do steal you are almost guaranteed to get away from it. So the owner sues anyone he catches, and tries to get 750x the value of the stolen goods ($750 is the minimum penalty per instance of infringement) to discourage stealing.<p>But then the store owner thinks up a way to profitably give away produce for  free. He then decides to wait to implement this business model until nobody buys produce from him anymore.<p>Now a few years pass and giving away produce is an acceptable and viable business model. Now how well is that grocery store owner going to get people to support him. I can just imagine a startup's advertising campaign:
""We'll give you our fruit for free. Sure you can get it for free from a bigger competitor, but that company is the same one who decided that taking one apple was worth a $750 fine.""<p>That grocery store owner is now only going to be able to get supporters in three cases.<p>1. He has a monopoly on a specific fruit. (Basically this would happen if the big media companies had signed all the decent bands in one genre).<p>2. He gets money no matter which store a person gets their fruit from. (So a 360 contract, you support a specific artist, you support Big Media).<p>3. He has more stores, so he is more convenient for the majority of people to support.(P2P is incredibly convenient, so this would only apply to people afraid of downloading viruses from a p2p network).<p>4. His supporters have never stolen fruit from him, or thought that $750 was a reasonable fine. (So you haven't ever pirated music, or you think the current lawsuits are reasonable).<p>Big media is just like that grocery store owner. They are actively going after an entire generation in a way that basically attacks that generation. The register did a survey where they found that the average teen has pirated 61% of his MP3 collection. And now they think that in a few years that generation will actively support them.<p>Register Survey: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/16/bmr_music_survey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/16/bmr_music_survey/</a><p>Wharton article on not suing your customers:<a href=""http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=863"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=863</a>",1236542776

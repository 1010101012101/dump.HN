8275284,comment,8274677,8275188,22,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As the article points out, they don&#x27;t. By running the business this way they are constantly building / growing new businesses but during a downturn they just build more slowly (rather than lose money). It is a very different way of operating but one which has provided some interesting benefits for them. Nominally a business uses profits to either pay dividends or fund unexpected opportunities (like buying some small company or what not) Amazon doesn&#x27;t pay dividends and they invest every dollar they make &quot;extra&quot; back into the business to increase the total number of dollars in the pipes. They don&#x27;t need to turn a profit, they just need to manage their investment profile to their revenue forecasts.<p>Interestingly enough, after reading that, I realized that Google doesn&#x27;t stand a chance in hell of beating them at commerce.",1409939998

8275281,comment,8273908,8273908,0,0,grumblestumble,,,"I really like this approach, but I think the thing that is currently missing is preprocessor/build support. The primary use case for this would be large-scale web applications -- it&#x27;s probably overkill for anything else. Unfortunately, for large apps, the performance hit of using ~= is unacceptable. However, most large apps use some kind of build system - grunt, gulp, make, etc, and writing a task to convert these into old-fashioned CSS class names as part of the build seems entirely doable.",1409939981

He called me into his office, and we set out upon what I imagined would be another exhausting session of freeing up memory.<p>Instead, he brought up a source file and pointed to this line:<p>static char buffer[1024 <i></i>* 1024 <i></i>* 2];\n&quot;See this?&quot; he said. And then deleted it with a single keystroke. Done!<p>He probably saw the horror in my eyes, so he explained to me that he had put aside those two megabytes of memory early in the development cycle. He knew from experience that it was always impossible to cut content down to memory budgets, and that many projects had come close to failing because of it. So now, as a regular practice, he always put aside a nice block of memory to free up when it&#x27;s really needed.`",1409939981

8275277,comment,8274677,8274677,4,0,hoprocker,,,"Reading this article reminded me of Steve Yegge&#x27;s summary of Amazon&#x27;s overall strategy: build a platform, not a product[0]. My takeaway here is that Amazon keeps reinvesting in making itself the platform through which sales run (warehouses, media, AWS, third-party storefronts). With the octo-copter idea[1] -- especially in combination with its third-party seller services -- it skirted the surface of becoming a physical delivery platform as well.<p>Anyways, fascinating post, really enjoyed the different cross sections of perspective presented.<p>[0] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesv...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=8037720011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=8037720011</a>",1409939968

You can easily use  ANY C/C++ build system with it, just set CC, CXX, LD, etc. environment variables to point to the GCC build in NDK folders. That way you can practically compile anything from Linux (which uses only available libc calls), not the least ffmpeg, openssl, curl, whatever you need.\nThe JNI rules are exactly the same as JNI rules are for any desktop Java app that uses native code. There is nothing special or &quot;funky&quot; in NDK - it&#x27;s all standard stuff you know from Linux if you ever used Java.<p>I&#x27;m noticing incredible amount of issues people have (at least in my sample helping them out in Freenode/#android-dev) due to not understanding this simple fact that NDK is just GCC and simply not understanding ANYTHING about how C/C++ app compiling works or not willing to learn basics of how JNI works.",1409939766

You&#x27;re right that a small minority of readers and gamers actually follow criticism compared to reviews.  I think the influence of criticism on authors is much much larger than the influence of criticism on game designers, though.<p>It has to do with the way we train people to write books as opposed to how we train people to make video games.  English degree programs often spend as much time on literary theory as they do on the practical aspects of composition.  Most CS and video game design programs are almost entirely practical.  I think this has allowed literature to move alongside and even in front of the culture at large while video games lag the rest of the culture.<p>Maybe this explains why we&#x27;ve gotten used to plenty of topics and themes in books that are still stunning in video games.  Think about how shocking it was to some people that we could play a gay character in Fable or Bully.  Nobody even notices when a best seller has a gay protagonist.",1409939039

It is certainly a problem, and lower latency is always better, but it&#x27;s an engineering problem, one that will eventually be solved. We have the necessary hardware to do this right now, the problem is our current state of the industry puts hardware and software developers way too far apart, and puts startup programmers and mathematicians too far apart, too.<p>Of far more concern is the UX issue. NO ONE has any clue how to design intuitive UI metaphors for VR yet. Oh sure, first person shooters are obvious. But what about everything that isn&#x27;t a game? Speaking from experience here [1], it is a pain in the ass to be constantly taking the head set off to switch between apps, to fiddle with the phone, to have to take it out of the headset rig to use the touch screen. What is first and foremost needed is a VR window manager.<p>Carmack is an excellent mathematician who understand how hardware works almost intuitively. He is not a designer; just look at Doom 3. And he does all of his work in the dark. If we were talking about web technology, people would dismiss a project for being so closed and inaccessible. We&#x27;ve come to expect open source for web tech, but for some reason we still have a view that default state of game tech is closed source. If VR is going to have the adoption rates necessary to have a healthy app ecosystem for users, it needs the low barrier to entry that open source provides for developers. It needs parallel, competing framework development. I don&#x27;t want Oculus and Samsung to be the only arbiters of how to design VR code. I don&#x27;t want users with $500 burning a hole in their pocket to be the only users who can experience VR. We can&#x27;t even get people to pay $3 for a smartphone app now, adding extra hardware cost is just going to make that worse.<p>We need creative people hacking away at the problem in their bedrooms and garages. Carmack is pursuing a model that requires startup capital just to get to play around.

Unfortunately for gaming this argument falls apart once you consider the sheer mass of portrayals of misogyny in games but the relative lack of portrayal of other social issues.<p>In other words, a trope (and now we delve into the thesis of Sarkeesian&#x27;s entire series of videos).<p>Her last video was very good and delves into this argument in specific. The gaming industry seems incapable of portraying &quot;gritty&quot; and &quot;bleak&quot; without shoving dead women in your face. Need your protagonist to realize the gravity of a situation? Show violence against women. Need to project an air of despair and injustice? Violence against women. Need to express the true evilness of the bad guy? ... You guessed it.<p>This suggests that portrayals of misogyny in gaming is more than an attempt to be even-handed or realistic. IMO Sarkeesian is correct in stating that portrayals of misogyny is used stereotypically and excessively for dramatic effect, and in doing so is ultimately dampening the very effect they&#x27;re trying to achieve.

The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. The weakness is its lack of validity.&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. Patients with mental disorders deserve better.&quot;<p>> Much work has gone into proposing, testing, and refining many theories on motivation and behavior ...<p>You aren&#x27;t using the scientific meaning of theory -- a formalization of observations using empirical evidence, that generalizes specific observations, that predicts things not yet observed, and that is falsifiable.<p>> Yet it&#x27;s hardly just observing the stars and making claims, and it&#x27;s certainly shown utility in helping design systems to influence behavior.<p>There are many ideas that meet this description, but they aren&#x27;t scientific theories as that term is defined.<p>Prove me wrong. Point to a theory in the class you describe that has been used to conclusively falsify someone else&#x27;s theory in the same field, a case in which the defender of the falsified theory acknowledges that his theory can been proven false and has no further utility. I say it this way because it happens all the time in science, and it never happens in psychology.<p>Consider the example of Asperger Syndrome. It was thrown out over a year ago by the editors of DSM-5, described as an unscientific and meaningless term, but I am still getting emails from parents whose children are being assigned the diagnosis.<p>Consider recovered memory therapy.

8275112,comment,8274529,8274529,27,0,ubasu,,,"The author&#x27;s point that &quot;curvature imputes stiffness&quot; conflates several different and distinct mechanisms, and offers an inadequate explanation.<p>For the examples of the pizza, the leaf, and the corrugated sheets, the stiffness is due to the fact that the bending moment of inertia of the cross-section increases when we fold the pizza or the sheet in a particular way [1]. The Theorema Egregium shows that such a structure can be made from a flat sheet of material, not that this construction imparts stiffness to the structure.<p>The example of arches show the well-known arch action in mechanics, where forces are carried through pure compression without any tensile stresses, which makes it appropriate for using stones to make the arch [2]. In principle, one could make a triangular &quot;arch&quot;, i.e. part of a truss structure, where we use two straight rods joined together at the top [3]. This shows that its not really the curvature that is giving the stiffness.<p>The example of hyperbolic paraboloids shows arch action in one direction and beam bending in the other.<p>The examples of the egg and the can show that it is hard to break a surface when it does not have stress concentrations [4].<p>So the point is that there&#x27;s a lot of classical solid mechanics at play here, of which the author seems to be unaware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_concentration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_concentration</a>",1409938358

First, it, through virtue of Haskell&#x27;s IO-concentration properties, forces you to pre-load your relevant environment variables and thus fail-fast due to misspellings and poor parses. Second, it tries to force you to interpret the ENV strings as typed values so that there&#x27;s a limitation of the syntactic space allowable in ENV files.<p>Finally, and most importantly, it uses an &quot;applicative functor structure&quot; so that the <i>exact</i> code which parses your ENV can be used to produce documentation automatically. This is nice because it will <i>always</i> be in-sync with your program (modulo errors in my own coding of the library).<p>If anyone is interested in using this in their Haskell code, I&#x27;d be more than happy to push out the newer version. It has much nicer parsers and better reporting.<p>[0] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/env-parser"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/env-parser</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://github.com/tel/env-parser-talk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tel/env-parser-talk</a>",1409937535

If somebody wants to have a go at brute forcing the password (this seems to be one of the ancient crypt based, easily broken entries), here&#x27;s the passwd entry:<p>root:z1sH85tcwYkQg:0:3::/:/sbin/sh<p>Anyway: Until then I&#x27;d really like to extract that HDD image into a filesystem I can traverse using Linux or BSD. What would be your approach of choice on this?<p>The ultimate goal would be to reverse the drivers talking to the spectrum analyzer hardware and maybe implement my own ones so that I could run Linux or a BSD on it.",1409936746

So the compiler shouldn&#x27;t be able to optimize out the call directly to the function pointer because it introduces a possible race condition:  the program reads that memset_ptr points to memset, then the pointer changes (due to some other process changing it), but the program still calls memset, and not memset_ptr.

Edit: Why? It's smaller, it's a micro-kernel, and there is a lot of documentation, both about the source, and about the theory of the source? And why is that, you ask?<p>For those who are just starting, the author (Tanenbaum) also wrote a book called Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, which is a great resource for learning the ins and outs of OSs.

Rand <i>never</i> said making money is the highest value nor that it should be the sole standard of any value, dropping all other context.<p>A moments thought, if you know anything of Rands works, would demonstrate this to you.  If you read The Foundtainhead, then you know that Roark gave up work for years because he had higher values in life than simply to maximize his income.  And Atlas Shrugged was about a man who did the same, and took a bunch of others with him -- not because they thought this was the best way to optimize their long-term money making potential, but because the rest of the world had come to regard them, being creative and productive individuals, as chattel.  (You might also recall that while there were a number of titans of industry, one was a composer, another was a professor, another an train engineer, etc.)<p>I don't know what it is about Rand that makes people think they're entitled to sling nonsense about her views around without the slightest effort at substantiation.  You say Rand's is a ""fairy tale land where everybody is always capable of making rational decisions with perfect information"" and ""Markets are always perfectly efficient"". This is your fairy tale about Rand's views.  I studied all of Rand's works quite extensively from about the age of 17 to 27, and I'm confident you cannot demonstrate that Rand held such views.",1282254682

I tried to emphasize the import points so even those who were skimming could get an idea of what to remember.<p>As to the question of ""niceness,"" I disagree wholeheartedly. All the advice here is to use resources that are provided to all passengers.<p>Moreover, the person who makes it to the front of the line in the status quo has no moral superiority over others that somehow makes them more deserving of a convenient flight. Indeed, the reason someone would make it to the front of the line is typically a function of luck (they're seated nearer to the front of the plane, or they know exactly where the counter is because they fly through the airport often, or they're alone and in good health and therefore able to sprint to the counter faster than the elderly, disabled, and families).<p>By contrast, you actively do a service to your fellow passengers by using this article's methods: you don't take up a space in line that makes everyone else wait longer.<p>But if you're a believer in generalizability instead, consider this: If everyone followed this article's advice, everyone would be equally likely to get the best remaining seats (which seems ultimately the most fair allocation).

1618772,comment,1618196,1618429,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I've read it. I was charmed by its philosophy...for a while. Then I had a good friend talk me down from the cloud.<p>The main theme of Atlas Shrugged, as I saw it, is that really smart/creative people are often used and abused by people in power, and that if all the smart/creative people left, that society would collapse.<p>Now, any attractive philosophy needs to have at least a grain of truth to be popular--and I fully agree that people are abused and manipulated by those in power. I identify as a smart and creative person, so of COURSE I want to be the one calling the shots, and not some idiot!<p>Where Rand falls short is in idolizing capitalism and taking an idealistic view of human nature. She also misses that if ANY large enough group walked out on society, it would grind to a halt--and that includes truck drivers, janitors, or whoever. It's called a strike.<p>The reality is that people are born into situations that make it possible to be smart/creative. The studies on this are conclusive--just giving a poor kid an extra year of preschool raises their chance of graduating high school, and their salary 35 years later. It's a fact that you were born to parents who taught you well as a young child that makes you smart enough to be arguing the merits of Ayn Rand.<p>This all destroys her core axiom that people who are the smart and creative builders of society are that way because of some inner moral purity, and therefore they deserve to be treated fairly--and the rest of society be damned, because they aren't as hard working/moral/whatever. The truth is that smart people are equally likely to be selfish (and lazy!) jerks; ""enlightened self interest"" is a fantasy that doesn't exist outside of possibly a few individuals and Rand novels. Looking at the other side, people without money or advanced skills frequently will vote against their own economic interests in order to vote their beliefs.<p>You can't base a real system of government on wishful thinking--ask the USSR how that worked out. Ironic that Rand came from that background only to espouse her own philosophy equally based on wishful thinking...but I digress.<p>The whole reality, in my opinion, is much bigger than just smart people being exploited: EVERYONE should be treated fairly, and no one should be exploited. Rand entices smart people by telling them that they're special, and that THEY are the ones should should be running the world. And to some degree I can buy into this. ;)<p>But not to the exclusion of helping others--and the sad truth of the matter is that charities can NOT do enough simply from voluntary contributions to support those who weren't as lucky in selecting their genes, and that means that taxes and government social programs are a necessary part of the moral behavior of society.<p>As are government rules that protect workers, or that protect the food supply, or that protect the environment, and the other things that libertarianism/objectivism would have us do away with.<p>She argues for pure, unregulated capitalism, and that's just completely insane. There's too much corporate influence in government as it is, and not enough regulation. Unless you think oil spills are fun, and don't mind the environmental damage that big Ag causes, and think that miners SHOULD be risking their lives for low pay, and on and on...<p>The reality is that the market spectacularly fails under some circumstances, and that government is necessary to regulate it.<p>There.

1618764,comment,1618041,1618698,0,0,jasonjei,,,"I think many of you are misinterpreting what I'm writing. I'm not discounting the influence of a place like New York or San Francisco--there is much to gain and great products are built in those cities, and your likelihood of success increases. What I am warning is that I hear the stories of founders that move to SF, don't have a product out, live off cash reserves, and months in to the project still no viable product. There are some who seem to believe the <i>inception</i> of any product must begin there.<p>To the contrary, I actually encourage people to move to SF and NYC because of the knowledge/experience/atmosphere. But you stand to have better chances when you move _prepared_ than when you move to a big city without a plan. Especially a city like NYC where starving, talented artists are a dime a dozen. It's the capital of capitalism.<p>Moving to a city is a step you make when you are firmly committed to the idea. Don't just move because you have an idea. Have your things in order. It's a lot like fishing--just make sure you have your bait before you go. If you have start worrying about lease, payroll, and so on from the very beginning, well, it'll be tough. But if you have a direction, like a minimal amount of code written already, you'll move into the big city much better prepared. Remember, cities like SF and NYC are capitals of capitalism.<p>Before you quit you job and move to a big city, be prepared about the gravity of such a decision. You'll need to commit to a lease. NYC leases are not cheap if you aren't already there. You'll need to spend time to setup your office/apartment (often the same). You're likely moving there to hire talent. But if you start a project without a strong beginning, you'll be burning cash--and a lot of it in a big city where wages and cost of living are higher.<p>There is no doubt about the economic influence of a place. But being in X won't stop you from being successful.  As long as you're driven, you will move to Y as long as you have a product and a plan.  Just my 2 cents.",1282254276

The carpet industry in Georgia is one such example; Internet startups in Silicon Valley are another; movies in L.A. is a third; and so on.<p><i>It's like moving to Hollywood because you want to be an actor or writer.</i><p>Take a look at William Goldman's <i>Adventures in the Screen Trade</i>, where he says:<p>""I find Los Angeles a very difficult and potentially dangerous place to work in, and I think anyone seriously contemplating a career as a screenwriter ought to move there as soon as it's humanly or financially possible"" {Goldman@74}.<p>Later:<p>Screenwriters should go to L.A. despite the problems. As Goldman says, ""To begin with the practical: Simply put, they know things out there the rest of the country doesn't, and they get that information first. The movie business is a part of the fabric of life in Los Angeles, and that just isn't true anywhere else. It is, if you will, in the air"" {Goldman@80}.<p>People who ignore this ignore it at their own peril.",1282252849

I grew up in Silicon Valley, went to college in Arizona, and recently got a job at an IT company in Kansas City after graduation. I know I want to move back to the bay area and work for a startup, maybe within a year, but I'm not sure if I've got enough experience.<p>I took some basic programming classes in college, enough to learn the concepts, but I had a hard time understanding how to put it all together into a complete application. It wasn't until I worked as a student web developer that things really started clicking. I worked for a year learning PHP and coding small web applications. Now I'm working at an IT firm as a consultant and doing some hacking when I'm not working 8-5. I'm working on a personal project right now...It's not any groundbreaking technology, just trying to automate a process for an industry that has, for the most part, not embraced the internet for their operations.<p>My question is, would 1 year of web development experience be enough to work at a startup? I feel like startups are looking for awesome programmers with CS degrees. I know there are other positions at startups but I feel like I just have a well rounded set of skills, nothing that really stands out. I guess I'd like to ask you guys if you work for a startup, what is your background and did you find it hard to get hired?",1282252803

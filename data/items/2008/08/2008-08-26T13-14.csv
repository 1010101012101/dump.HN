287054,comment,286959,286959,0,0,biohacker42,,,"I suggest you start out with some basic chemistry. There you can find the data on how the amino acid chains line up and fold and twist. There was that game somebody released where you ""fold"" with the mouse. I think it was an experiment to find out if humans can do the folding faster then computers. That should give you an idea of the problem.<p>The core problem in protein folding is that all the parts heavily interact with each other. And that means that it is not easily split across nodes. Forget about networked nodes, the latency is way too big.<p>Some academic groups have proposed a funnel shape to the folding probabilities. That is to say that initially things  could go in any direction and the possibility space is HUGE. But as the protein grows the number of possible moves collapse quickly and you are left with very few moves at the end.<p>I think the Features in Biotech podcast had at least one show on protein folding, fun to listen to.<p>Hope this helps, enjoy yourself.",1219758391

287051,comment,286528,286904,0,0,william-newman,,,"I think the EM field properties are somewhat peculiar even before you get to experimental results that force you to quantize the field. Granted, the EM field is not so weird that understanding the general properties of more tangible waves isn't helpful. E.g., I learned a lot from the ripple tank experiments and demonstrations in my high school physics classes, demonstrating properties like diffraction and the tendency not to scatter from too-small obstacles. That kind of stuff applies nicely to EM waves. But that general familiarity with waviness didn't prepare me for things like relativistic invariance. And historically, I'm in good company there: various sharp 19th century physicists were misled about EM by pursuing the analogy with the more tangible waves they were familiar with.",1219758261

When I moved from Python to ML, I was equally adamant about static typing being the way to go, because the ML type system is pretty awesome in terms of compile-time error-checking and documentation. Now that I'm learning Lisp, I'm open to the benefits of dynamic typing, or at least want to keep an open mind about the matter.",1219757997

287039,comment,286045,286513,0,0,icey,,,"What is likely happening is that he's rapidly selecting out of the database immediately after inserting his record. I am guessing that he's trying insert a number of records at once. SQL does something weird with locking when you use an auto-incrementing integer for a primary key - it uses page locking for safety when creating records.<p>So if he's just inserted record #10, and is now trying to select it while simultaneously inserting record #11, there can be some problems with timing. It's pretty rare, but if he's running a program to blast a bunch of stuff in at once, I've seen it happen.<p>The other possibility is that he's inserting or updating foreign key requirements at the same time he's trying to select out that data; and he has the option turned on to enforce foreign key constraints. SQL will lock the dependent data while any updates or inserts occur to ensure the FKs are valid through the lifetime of the transaction execution on the foreign table.",1219757524

This is one thing that I think guides the discussion in a more meaningful direction than boredat/juicycampus. We have community moderation, so that if your post is reported a couple times by other users then it is removed and your posting privileges are temporarily suspended. This helps cut down on the excessively slanderous posts that you see on juicycampus.<p>As for it being a fad... At my school we had a live journal board and it has remained popular for at least 3 years now. I'm pretty convinced that if done right, we will be able to keep the attention of the student body.

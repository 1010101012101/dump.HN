If you buy that perspective, he wasn't wrong to execute far better on the same ideas that have appeared repeatedly in the history of social networks- he was simply a sucky friend, which is unlikeable but not illegal.<p>He's made a bunch of people very rich with Facebook. Do you think D'Angelo, the Winklevosses, and Saverin would rather have never met Zuckerberg or would rather he never created Facebook?<p>>3) Even though our society might tolerate and even reward (in the short-term at least) this sort of behaviour, should we be happy that a master-exploiter of this unfairness is the guardian of social relationships on the internet?<p>The sin Mark's accused of is stealing people's ideas, assuming ideas are steal-able, and thereby breaching the trust of people who considered themselves his friends or coworkers. If he's guilty, I guess the question is whether someone who is immoral/amoral in one respect is able to be ethical in other areas.<p>Since the movie makes a good case that Zuckerberg betrayed some of his close friends, I don't trust him (or any random person) not to betray me, a random stranger / Facebook user. But I do trust Zuckerberg to want to do whatever is good for Facebook. Are people scared he's going to somehow blackmail them into staying on Facebook by threatening to release their private data to everyone? I'll be scared of that scenario if that ever seems like the best plan for Facebook.<p>Who else could run Facebook? Most people are less intelligent or less competent or less interested in Facebook's future. Almost anyone in Mark's situation would cash out and grow indifferent but Zuckerberg persuades me he's not doing it for the money. So I guess I'm happy he's running it because regardless of his moral judgment or human loyalty at least I feel like he cares about Facebook.<p>I think many problems with corporations arise from leaders' interests not being aligned with those of the company. Facebook is one of the few examples where I don't believe that's the case. It might seem psychopathic to care more about Facebook than your best friend and/or cofounder, but is that really a big problem? Maybe from the corporation's perspective (or from the user and shareholder perspective), it's actually a virtue.",1348102757

It doesn't have that kind of ""putting together two and two"" power. \nPlus it doesn't share that with your other family members or suggest to them that they get to know your extra-marital partner better.<p>Where am I going with this...scratch this reply.<p>If you can't see the potential for abuse at FB (or any other similarly massive soc-net) and somehow are trying to draw parallels to some big box vendor with no social tentacles, my explanation will not advance your understanding of it either.<p>No current corporation, conglomerate or organization - Disney, Visa, Experian, Equifax, Transunion, ExxonMobil, Monsanto - has that kind of established and potential scope for intrusion into your life.<p>Not even Acxiom has that kind of potential.",1348102752

",,"Hi HN,<p>A little bit about me: I am going to finish up my undergraduate degree in May of 2013 with majors in Computer Science and Chemistry and a minor in Mathematics. I have programmed since I was a little kid and am well-versed in a myriad of languages (thanks, Dad!) and it is by far my favorite method of problem solving.<p>I've had various different internships throughout high school and college, from working at IBM's Linux Technology Center to working in labs from biomedical engineering to organic chemistry to quantum computation. The atmosphere I've experienced at all of these places has never felt quite right to me -- I'm a very social person and I enjoy risky and highly collaborative environments, which is why as of the past year or so I've been toying with the idea of seeking out a job at a startup after I graduate.<p>Since I had never really been exposed to chemistry before college, I spent my extra time doing chemistry research (often times, this involved at least a fair amount of coding, most of which I unfortunately can't share) and not as much developing personal projects and other things that startups often look for when hiring new grads -- I've made a point to switch my focus from chemistry to computer science for my final year, though.<p>My question: Is there a place for a generalist natural/computer scientist in the startup world?<p>Thanks for your insight!<p>EDIT: Formatting woes.",1348102417

To find cosy coffee shops to catch-up with friends.<p>Just putting my marketing hat on here, but I suggest you refine your value proposition - e.g. on your homepage replace 'Sign in and start sharing' with something more value-laden, like 'For coffee lovers' or 'The ultimate coffee guide' or 'The world coffee hub'.

4546378,comment,4541501,4543488,1,0,caycep,,,"well unofficially, at least so they say, in the very beginning, the lightweight fighter program was conceived in secret by 5 guys in a back room in a pentagon - John Boyd, Pierre Sprey of the Close Air Support/A-10 fame, and a couple others known as the ""fighter mafia"".   Much of the specs, requirements, and various aerodynamic parameters were determined before the bureaucratic majors and colonels knew about the project.   The prototype aircraft were designed by engineers as side projects at Lockheed and Northrup, more or less under the radar.   It probably helped that all the bigwigs were haggling about the F-15 at the time, which acted as a smokescreen.<p>It wasn't until it became apparent that the YF-16 was the real deal and probably going to be successful that it was finally exposed to the Pentagon procurement process, where it started to put on the pounds, and lost a bit of the agility that made the prototype aircraft famous  (i.e. it had delta kinetic energy moves that the F-22 and F-35 can only accomplish via thrust vectoring).",1348102341

They love to put up examples of stuffing 3 classes into a war and testing it, to which I say, why?  It makes sense if your testing a CDI extension (who incidentally seem to be the only people using Arquillian).  If I wanted to test 3 classes from my app I'd mock the injects with mockito.  Its far faster and easier to use mockito to inject instances, especially since mockito can instrument those injections allowing you to assert method call information.<p>Where this all falls apart is where Arquillian should shine: integration tests.  e.g. put up a functional JSF controller/view and fire requests at it with JSFUnit.  You now have to package up enough stuff into your war to get a functional JSF environment running.  Arquillian doesn't help you at all to figure out what dependencies you need to include to just get JSF running.  As a result you end up playing games trying to get the WAR to include what it needs to run which can be much harder than it sounds due to the way much of the EE6 stack is layered and intertwined.  You end up having to include a ludicrous amount of stuff to get JSF running.  Or you just say 'fuck it' and tell Arquillian to include your entire pom and get a huge deploy.  On top of this is managing your own dependencies.  Is your view modularized and using 5 different sub views and supporting controllers (and associated helpers?).  Its all up to you to track and manage this.  Its like being thrown back into a world without maven for every single test case you try to setup.  I found I spent more time trying to figure out what I needed to deploy than I did writing tests.<p>Also your completely screwed if you try to do a service layer down to database integration test and your using hibernate.  Waiting for hibernate to start up on every test class is brutal.  Getting rid of hibernate makes testing and many other things so much easier.  If you stop to think about how much crap exists in the stack just to deal with hibernates session lifecycle and transaction requirements its amazing.  In my current app I have about ~65 entity and ~70 tables, switching from Hibernate to Ebean and ditching the libraries I no longer needed to deal with hibernates session management dropped my final war size by ~15MB (40%), cut startup time in half, and allowed me to remove over a thousand lines of code.",1348100703

4546282,comment,4545263,4545263,63,0,grellas,,,"<i>Institutional investors made the mistake - again, and again, and again - of validating Mark's duplicitousness by pouring literally billions of dollars into his company, and then billions more into startups seeking to emulate it. Some of their investments created out of thin air industries that contribute absolutely nothing to, and in many cases even detract from, society. . . . Most mind-boggling of all, it's been clear for a long time that Mark's ""social"" business model doesn't work anyway: venture capital returns are down, and not just a little bit. Meanwhile, the opportunity cost to society is enormous: with engineers and capital allocated to virtual-sheep-throwing, worthless advertising and sharing ad nasuem, almost a decade's worth of real innovations got the short end of the stick, including but not limited to mine.</i><p>There needs to be a label placed on the idea of feeling the need to bow to the wishes of critics who try to limit the idea of valid entrepreneurship to activities deemed ""beneficial to society."" I propose Founder's Guilt Complex.<p>Why on earth - when life is so big and beautiful and complex - should I feel guilty if I make money from an activity that does nothing more than give people a diversion from life's burdens and problems? College football may be a joke to pointy-head types but then reading Latin (my own peculiar idea of fun) is equally a joke to the cheering fans who join in inter-collegiate rivalries. Likewise for playing video games or hiking in the woods or listening to rock-and-roll or producing reality-TV shows or most any other activity you can name whose main goal is relaxation, entertainment, escape from life's burdens, or just plain self-indulgence. And social networking is no exception. I may not do much on Facebook (I don't) but so what? Others can and do like to share things with people of varying degrees of relationship to them and more power to them for liking to do this. It is their choice. It is a free country. It is not for me to be a scold who upbraids them for doing so. Nor should I be crabbed or pinched about what founders choose to do to create and market products and services designed to satisfy such proclivities or to make money from them.<p>Yes, I can set about in life to conquer diseases or to abolish poverty or to alleviate people's suffering and all such things are ennobling. I can do such things via a profit-making venture or I can make my money on other things and then use it to advance higher goals through giving. Or I can devote time and energy to helping others in my personal life. All of that is great but it hardly defines the boundaries of worthwhile human activity. Life has enough problems without having someone of a judgmental spirit continually taking us to task for wanting to have some fun as well or for trying to promote fun things for others. In a free society, there is room for fun things as well and for those who see it as worthwhile to take risk in building companies that seek to market less-than-weighty things to the public.<p>Life certainly can be perverse. In 17th century England, as modern western society was taking shape, you had, on the one side, royalists who despised political freedom, who valued rule by a church hierarchy, and yet who were much given to licentious habits in their lifestyles while, on the other, you had those who agitated for political freedom, who fought oppressive forms of centralized rule, who ultimately broke away to form what became America, and yet who in their personal lives bore the grim face of the puritan that sought at every turn to chain, quarter, and shame everyone all about who thought it might be fun to dance or to have a little fun in life. It seems that in our modern society we have ported over the spirit of the puritan in castigating others even as we have won the freedoms that allow us under law to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Well, if the pursuit of happiness was deemed a worthy goal of a society's founding documents, far be it from me to stand grim-faced telling others that they should feel guilty in not conforming to my narrow view of acceptable life activities - and that <i>includes</i> how I choose to make my living or start my business.<p>I don't think this is a mere technical issue either. I believe that no guilt or stigma should attach to ventures doing legal things just because they don't set out to solve World Problems. The poor have always been with us. So too have wars, rapes, and murders. Ditto for disease and death. I am the first to say ""bravo"" to those who do not sit resigned to accept all these destructive elements in life but who instead spur themselves to do something to help make things better not just for themselves but for the broader society too. That said, such activities cannot be the only things that define our goals in life, nor should they be. There is value in having enjoyment and fun in life and this is a transcending value that betters society. In the entrepreneurial world, there is no room for a spirit of self-righteousness. Therefore, I say away with Founder's Guilt Complex. If you want to do a venture, do it honestly and with integrity, drive, boldness, and energy. Just don't let others tell you that you should feel guilty about offending their scruples. Enjoy and make it work without guilt. You can deal with Weighty Issues too if you are so led. Just don't listen to those who say that what you are doing is not worthwhile unless it is narrowly confined to them.<p>So if the VC industry chose to pour all kinds of money into creating something called social networking, and if all kinds of talented engineers have flocked to that industry in pursuit of money or other personal goals, that is by definition a great benefit to society because it has given many, many people the chance to do things that were scarcely thought possible just a decade ago - and to derive simple pleasures from the diversions or other benefits afforded to them through such networking. Whatever the flaws associated with individual people or companies in such an industry, there is nothing whatever wrong with those who devoted their money and their efforts to making all this possible.",1348100109

Imagine if you connect to the Wifi and it didn't do this... you'd have no idea why you're not receiving <i></i>any<i></i> of your data.<p>For what it's worth, recent copies of Android try to help you through the captive portal process as well, though I doubt they fail if android/google.com go down. (Though, Android has always had an indicator, they only become colored after Gapps makes a good connection to Google)",1348099205

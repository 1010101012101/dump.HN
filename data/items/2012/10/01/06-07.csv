My memory is fuzzy on the detail, but I think there was a time in the mid -> late 80s where Turbo Pascal was greatly improved, and become close to the Object Pascal language which is still in use today.\nI'd be guessing you were using the 'pre-improvements' version of TP. I have to admit, I have a soft-spot for Object Pascal, and still use it fairly often (in a project for a long-standing client; the software was originally developed in TP, and was eventually moved to Delphi 7 which is what I use for maintenance to this day).",1349074799

And besides their near-monopoly, they survive because their results are still better, not 10 times better, but better nonetheless.<p>There are people here using Duck Duck Go. I'm not one of those people because DDG does not have better search results for me. Google does a good job currently at customizing search results. That's why they felt the need to compete with Facebook in the first place, because people want search results recommended by their acquaintances. They do have enough data to know at least some of your interests but they lacked a good social graph. To see how they can customize search results based on your Google+ graph, checkout [1]<p>And of course, the quality of Google can definitely improve. Personally I feel like Google isn't doing enough to combat black SEO techniques and content farms. This may be because they are trying to not piss off their users or because those content farms bring them too much revenue. And it's also my feeling that Google is no longer neutral - the placement of results from Google Places and Maps whenever you search for places has hurt websites like Yelp and TripAdvisor.<p>However an alternative search engine will barely be a glitch on anyone's radar if your value proposition is stuff like ""respect for privacy"" or ""an API"". Not to mention you can't provide both privacy and results based on ""social context"" - to customize the search results in a social context, by definition you have to track the user's social context. I did notice that the text says ""respect [for] privacy"", but who's to say that Google doesn't respect your privacy? That's not the same as giving privacy to users.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3452912"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3452912</a>",1349074210

A a feature protected by a design patent is <i>supposed</i> to have no functional utility.

Bike lanes on the main traffic arteries of Copenhagen is pretty much a thing of the last 10-15 years or so.

Of course, people moving from there and into Copenhagen took their biking habits with them.<p>Copenhagen has other incentives that makes biking the choice: Huge taxes on cars (first a 25 percent VAT, then 105 percent fee for the first roughly 14,000 dollars of the value of the car (incl. the VAT), then 180 percent on the exceeding value of the car), huge taxes on gasoline (the gasoline tax alone is around 3.5 dollars per gallon, then there is the 25 percent VAT, bringing the total price per gallon up around 8 dollars). Further, in many parts of Copenhagen the daily fee for parking exceeds 20 dollars.<p>Also, Copenhagen is relatively dense, compared to many American cities, and many families living in the suburbs have at least one parent working locally (typically in public sector jobs such as teaching, day care, elderly care, the local municipality etc.).

I can give the idea of the same proof without any reference to infinite ordinals.<p>First let's take a slightly more verbose notation than the wiki link uses.  Let's say that B(b, b', n) is the operation put n into hereditary base b notation, then change the base to b'.  Let's define G(b, n) as 1 if n = 0, and otherwise as 1 + G(b+1, B(b, b+1, n) - 1).  Then the original G(n) is just G(2, n).<p>If n < b, then by induction on n we can easily prove that G(b, n) is well-defined (here being well-defined is the same as being a finite number), in fact it is just n + 1.<p>If n = n_1 b+n_0, with n_1 and n_2 < 0, then by induction on n_1 we can easily prove that G(b, n) is well-defined.<p>Now by induction we can easily prove that if 2, n_0, n_1, n_2 are < b then G(b, n_0 + n_1 b + n_2 b^2) is well defined.<p>We can go farther and by induction we can prove that if m, n_0, n_1, ..., n_m < b then G(b, n_0 + n_1 b + n_2 b^2 + ... + n_m b^m) is also well-defined.<p>Now we're in a position to prove that G(b, b^b) is well-defined.  After that we repeat the previous proof and find out that if k < b^b then G(b, k + b^b) is well-defined.<p>Now we can do an induction proof that G(b, 2 b^b) is well-defined.<p>And so on.  In fact what we discover if we're careful is this.  For each hereditary base pattern, there exists an inductive proof that G(b, n) with that hereditary base pattern is well-defined.  The challenge is that the necessary proof <i>changes</i> as the hereditary base patterns get bigger.<p>What transfinite induction provides is a way to describe, in a unified way, the underlying idea behind all of those different inductive proofs into a single one.  In particular every hereditary base pattern is mapped onto a (possibly infinite) ordinal.  The operation B(b, b', n) does not change which ordinal you're mapped on to.  But the operation -1 always decreases the ordinal.  Thus we get a decreasing sequence of ordinals.  And transfinite induction says that all decreasing sequences of ordinals must terminate in a finite number of steps.  The pattern of the necessary inductive proofs is dependent upon the ordinal.<p>What the Peano axioms lack is any way to unify all of those individual inductive proofs into a single one.  Thus for any given integer n we can come up with a proof that G(b, n) is well-defined.  But we can't prove that fact for all positive integers n with a single proof.<p>Therefore this is really an exercise about the limitations of the set of possible proof techniques that the Peano axioms provide, and not about the limitations of computability.<p>(Of course the limitations of computability on real machines are much, much stricter than the limitations of the Peano axioms.  We can't say much that is useful about G(12) other than, ""Unbelievably big.""",1349072821

Making yourself a bit safer is good if it doesn't bother you much but you should realize that life is just slow decay in hazardous environment and you have to balance your risks with what you want to do during your life and with your convenience.<p>As for helmets. Drivers tend to pass closer to bikers that wear helmets (UK study) and unsurprisingly bikers that wear helmets have more accidents. Success stories that tell ""helmet saved my life after being hit by a car"" are often failure stories because of your helmet you and the guy that hit you felt confident enough to share same space.<p>I never wore a bike helmet although if I owned one I'd probably wear it as additional safeguard.

Or how investors vastly prefer known founders, even when they have been previously burnt by them, rather than taking risks on unknown quantities.

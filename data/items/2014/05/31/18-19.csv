The obsolescence rate for desktops dropped off sharply so sales have slumped, but they&#x27;re still being used a <i>lot</i>.  Laptops, especially small form-factor ones, have historically been underpowered.  However, they&#x27;re also reaching the point where they&#x27;re going to last for years and years if they&#x27;re not deliberately hamstrung by soldered on batteries, etc.. No doubt manufacturers saw this coming and hence, tablets became the next big thing.<p>Tablets, at present, are almost all underpowered.  Even the performance king, the Surface 3, reportedly doesn&#x27;t have quite enough horse-power to push its newly expanded stable of pixels. For this reason, tablet sales are going to remain hot for a few years at least, even if tablets claim relatively few hours of use versus laptops or computers.<p>A big question of concern for electronics manufacturers is: What&#x27;s next?

While ADA can call c directly, we had to support HPUX and SUN so sometimes we had to write c code and call that (#IFDEF HPUX).  This was a pain.<p>The package system was very good, especially at dividing work among a large team (30+ programmers).<p>We had a lot of fake external hardware simulators we used to test our code against.  This worked well as long as our simulators worked like the actual external hardware. It did with some frustrating exceptions of course discovered during the final test.<p>Dealing with time is a pain in all languages (UTC vs GPS) I think sidereal time thrown in for fun.<p>I remember some of those procedures (design->code->integrate,formal test->ship) that DOD projects had.

That doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t some with a better chance than others (it also doesn&#x27;t mean that there are). Also, while everyone experiences things differently, I think there are probably some things that most people will agree on as good things and bad things in an employer. I will venture to name some:<p>The opportunity to work on hard/interesting problems; good salary/benefits relative to the industry; the company is interested in advancing your career/training you to be better when you leave than when you came in; the company places an emphasis on engineering rather than treating it like an unfortunate necessity; programmers are given some level of autonomy or self-determination, the structure is not overly hierarchical; the company tracks developer productivity in reasonable ways rather than based on LOC or ass-time in seat.<p>There are probably a lot of other things that could go on that list, and at some companies, I&#x27;m sure that all of these really depend on where you are in the organization. But I can&#x27;t believe that these and other things can&#x27;t be influenced by corporate policy and practice, and that there aren&#x27;t some companies that make these sorts of things a priority when others don&#x27;t.<p>All that being said, I asked the question because I&#x27;ve never worked at a big company before, and maybe I&#x27;m totally off base. I was genuinely curious. I&#x27;d be happy to hear people&#x27;s impressions of different companies, or a real explanation for why all big companies are the same and none of them are any better than any others at keeping their developers happy.

Much mathematics is done with the understanding that the ideas can be made rigorous, and the point of educating people in mathematics is to allow them to craft arguments and revise when they find holes. One can and should introduce rigor gradually over time, and get the benefits of learning to reason and doing mathematics.<p>When it comes to mathematics, the exact form of the outcome is <i>extremely</i> important.

I thought I would just share some of our thoughts and experience with the app naming and discoverability problem.<p>An app will rank differently on different keywords in different App Stores. For every keyword you compete with other apps that uses the same keywords. So popular keywords are harder to rank high with than others and &quot;Champion&quot; isn&#x27;t easy of cause. But we&#x27;ve done a lot of testing on this subject and there are several things you can do.<p>We use a site called Sensor Tower [1] to track keyword rankings between the different App Stores.<p>First thing is of cause to add extra names to your App Store title and hope that people search for &quot;champion live score&quot; or &quot;champion football&quot;, which will greatly increase your chances (our full App Store title is &quot;Champion - Football Livescore&quot;).<p>But actually we found that it doesn&#x27;t take as much as we thought to become #1 on a keyword like Champion. We launched first in the Thai App Store to be able to test a lot of this before the global launch. We&#x27;ve been in the Thai App Store for almost 2 months now and it took us less than 1 month to become the #1 app for the keyword &quot;champion&quot;.

I know how to carry a conversation: give and take, tell jokes, etc. I have traveled widely.<p>Because of this differentiation, I&#x27;ve found it very easy to pick up women in SF.

A dotless domain typed in the address bar redirects to first search result of a particular search engine.  \n\n  2.

You give the student a problem, they think about it for a long time, and give their answers as to why. You discuss their answers with them, and then after they revise their answers, you present an elegant and correct answer. Then you repeat.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, for example, that nobody asks how to teach one to answer &quot;why&quot; when you&#x27;re, say, analyzing the motives of a character in some piece of literature. What do they do? They discuss, then they revise, and at some point the teacher presents either a good piece of student work or some other established ideas. Is mathematics really that different just because in the end you can tell with certainty that an answer is correct or incorrect? English teachers have one on one conversations with their students about their work, and they make students have discussions with each other about their thoughts on a daily basis. Why can&#x27;t math teachers do the same?<p>I think part of the reason math is plagued by such questions is that most people don&#x27;t realize that a proof (aka the answer to &quot;why?&quot;) is not <i>just</i> correct or incorrect, but has aesthetic properties. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s clear that mathematics is set apart from this on day one. Just compare any high school math syllabus to a syllabus in another subject [1]<p>[1]&quot; <a href=""http://j2kun.svbtle.com/what-would-math-class-look-like-if-it-were-a-fine-art"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j2kun.svbtle.com/what-would-math-class-look-like-if-i...</a>",1401559387

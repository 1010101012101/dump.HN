The majority of the time it get little to no reception for me, even in an open area. I would rather use the slightly slower edge network and enjoy battery life and reception. I remember why I switched to Verizon 4 or 5 years back now.<p>GPS drops out nearly as frequently as my service. God forbid you go to a populous area. I was at shea stadium last week for a concert. Didnt have reception the entire show. Could couldnt make calls, send texts or use the internet. I also found the phone trying so hard to keep up a connection that my battery went from 80% to completely dead in 4 hrs. I'm confident apple will get the dodgy software bugs fixed in the next few months. As for AT&T... I'm not expecting much from them anytime soon.",1216706146

But selling more could come from either lowering the price, or keeping the price fixed but adding value. Thinking about it more, DDR3 does seem like a possibility. I don't think there is any way they can sell it to the general public on speed, but it does use about 30% less power. I'm not sure how much power RAM uses in general, but if it increased the battery life significantly (combined with Montevina) then that would be a powerful incentive to get people to switch.<p>Either way, my money is still on the new product being the redesigned MacBook, but I'd love to be proved wrong in a few weeks.",1216704274

Also, unless they plan to take a significant loss on the SSDs, I don't see how making them standard will make their hardware <i>more</i> price competitive.<p>The Atom laptop is a total shot in the dark, and is likely wrong, but it seems like there must be something more significant in the pipeline.",1216702882

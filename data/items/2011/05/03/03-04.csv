2508925,comment,2507808,2508561,17,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"First, let's talk about 'computer science' much as viewed via 'programming' and, indeed, as in the article.<p>Here's 'programming' in a nutshell:  (A) Look at the problem and see what data is needed.  Allocate appropriate 'chunks' of main memory for the data and give the chunks some names, usually mnemonic.  (B) Manipulate the data with assignment statements from expressions, If-Then, and Do-While.  (C) Otherwise use divide and conquer and call functions, subroutines, APIs, etc.  So, that's the ABC's of programming.<p>For these ABC's all the common languages Algol, Cobol, Fortran, PL/I, C, C++, Rexx, Visual Basic .NET, C#, etc. are all very similar, more similar than English, French, Spanish, and Italian.  'Object oriented' programming?  People did essentially this in Fortran and PL/I, likely also Algol, long before C++.  IBM had object oriented programming in microcode in the early 1970s.  Exceptional condition handling?  Throw-Catch or Try-Catch are nowhere nearly as powerful as On Conditions in PL/I.  Concurrency?  We have mutex, semaphores, and actors and maybe more -- it's time for more:  E.g., with lots of object instances and lots of threads, run into the same problems solved via transactional integrity in relational database with automatic deadlock detection and resolution, and basically, at least first cut, need the same solution.<p>Net, 'programming' as practiced and as in the article hasn't changed much in 40 years.  In particular in recruiting no sense in getting all picky about some 40 years old material.  The picky guy in the article didn't know enough to know how silly he was being.  E.g., the corresponding guy at Google asked me what my favorite programming language was.  I said PL/I.  Of course he wanted C++.  But, net, PL/I is a much better designed language than C++.  My mention of PL/I ended the conversation.<p>Second, let's talk about what is important:  Broadly, the future is important, and about that what is important is making it.  So, how to do that?  Here's by far the most powerful, broad 'paradigm':  Have operations with powerful, known properties.<p>Now, considering how abstract computing is, to have some properties known is basically to have a theorem and a proof.  Sorry 'bout that, but that remains the situation.  \nOr, if we are going to build a large, complicated system where at each step all we have is ""I think so, usually, maybe"", then don't ask for much reliability for the resulting system.<p>Or, think like a mechanical engineer designing a Boeing 767:  Start with some very well known engineering properties of the materials.  From those properties use, say, finite element calculations, to determine the properties of various larger pieces of the airplane.  Same for building bridges, buildings, cars, etc.<p>So, generally in building things, need to know the properties of what are working with.  Also in computing.<p>Now, so far in computing, the more important 'pieces' were the now traditional topics in algorithms and data structures from Knuth's TACP, etc.  Or we read about DeRemer's LALR parsing from Ullman.  Or we read about k-D trees from wherever.  Now ancient, but fine for 40 years ago and still good for the original purposes.<p>But for the future, we want more.  Here's where computer science (CS) ran out of gas and got off track:  CS wanted to move closer to the real problems.  So, CS ran into 'information', 'knowledge', manipulating information, etc. and started borrowing ugrad texts in applied math, optimization, statistics, stochastic processes, graph theory, control theory, etc.  These fields are based on theorems and proofs, but CS set those aside.  Bummer since the theorems and proofs are the main way we know what we have, that is, the properties we need to depend on.<p>In particular, long the main criterion of artificial intelligence (AI) was just to program it and 'play with it and see if it seems intelligent'.  So, the criterion was not that start with some assumptions that hold in the real problem, use the assumptions to justify some theorems, and use the theorems to construct the system so that we know what we have.  Similarly there is 'machine learning' which also is working just empirically on the results and largely ignoring the assumptions, theorems, and proofs.  Then there is the respect for heuristics, that is, guesses with no known properties except what we can see empirically.  Basically CS and AI are becoming C- students in applied math, and that is NOT good.<p>My view is that the future of computing will have to borrow closely from the 'paradigm' of applied math, with a lot of careful attention to assumptions, theorems, and proofs.  Then we will have 'pieces' with known properties we can assemble into the larger systems we need.<p>In a nutshell, CS and Silicon Valley know very well how to program at the level of ABC above but are very short on what to program.  E.g., at Stanford, f'get about CS and listen to, say, P. Diaconis.  At Berkeley, listen to L. Breiman.  At Princeton, listen to E. Cinlar.  At CMU, S. Shreve.  At MIT, D. Bertsekas.  Alas, none of these professors and none of their students would make it past the first-cut interview of the article!<p>Here's an example:  Recently yet again we had a large server farm with lots of parallelism and redundancy go big time belly up.  I mean, they had this backing up that, and when this got too full it got more from there, etc.  Intuitively, it all looked really good.  Intuitively.  A proof?  Nope.  Was it good?  Nope.  It sucked.  Terrible design that made the Titanic look good.  Not nearly the first time for such a thing!<p>Let's just take the first, simplest part of this problem, near real-time detection that something is sick instead of well.  So, we have two ways to be wrong, false alarms and missed detections.  From Diaconis, we can learn about Neyman-Pearson (Neyman was long at Berkeley) where we see how to get the lowest rate of missed detections for whatever false alarm rate we are willing to tolerate.  Now we are at the level of a junior course in mathematical statistics but already way, WAY past essentially all of the system monitoring community in both computer science and practical computing.  NOT good.<p>Next, what we want, and we can't escape that, is essentially a statistical hypothesis test.  So, we have data on each of several variables and with no reasonable chance of knowing the probability distribution.  So, we need a multi-variate, distribution-free statistical test.<p>Now we are into reseach-level computer science.  Just ain't going to get there with intuitive, heuristic, or empirical methods.  Instead, notice where have some exchangability and a finite group of data transformations that are 'measure preserving' and derive a new class of hypothesis tests.<p>'Computer science'?  Nice progress on an important problem in computing, but several chaired profs of computer science at top research universities and editors in chief of top computer science journals confessed that neither they nor anyone on their board of editors could review such math.  Out'a gas.<p>For more on how to design a reliable server farm, need some more applied math, likely beyond essentially all of CS.  Instead, for the right stuff as prerequisites, start with some good applied math people such as I mentioned.  For CS, f'get about it.  Right:  For the future of CS, largely f'get about CS -- it's out'a gas.<p>The guy in the article doesn't have even as much as a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about this situation.  The people he recruits are guaranteed to hold his company back to 40 years ago.  He thinks he's a tough recruiter looking for the best of the best of the best, but he will only take people 40 years out of date.  How 'bout that!",1304394634

We were extremely happy with their dedicated server, virtually never had to use their support and never had to worry about the server going down. \nBut their cloud offering is a whole different story. I lost track of the number of time, we just could not connect to the server. This was not a disk problem but a network problem. Twice we raised support tickets and once it took around 6 hours to resolve and the other time it took 3 hours to resolve. In all that time all we only got generic replies that asked us to wait for updates. These two major incidents were in addition to at least three times where the server was not accessible for like 30-40 minutes each time, where we did not raise a support ticket. All this in a span of less than a month. \nWe moved to the cloud for the same reason, in terms of cost and usage. But the pain of not being able to access a server when you need it is just not worth it. We are testing out Rackspace. Hopefully that will be a better experience.",1304394049

(That is more to be expected, as Mark Twain is the favorite attribution for newly made-up quotations in English.) I checked Snopes for that one, but it's too new to be on Snopes, I think, and anyway isn't in Google Books either.

2508877,comment,2508768,2508768,10,0,jerf,,,"I'm going to say something probably unpopular, given the tone of many of the suggestions popping up, but philosophy is one case where I actually prefer to stay <i>away</i> from the so-called ""primary sources"". They are typically extraordinarily long and verbose for what they have to say, and if the idea some source is groping for is genuinely new, the fact that they are only in the beginning phases of grappling with it tends to show in the presentation. Plus they will tend to use quirky nomenclature that was not necessarily settled on later. If I'm after an actual understanding of philosophy and not merely enjoying some work for its own sake, it's better to read something that has been distilled over the years to its essence and stripped of its ornamentation, so you can contemplate the essence of the idea on its own.<p>I scare-quoted ""primary source"" because in a way, the ideas belong to humanity as a whole and the first person to ""discover"" a particular school of thought is not always its best advocate; it's primary more in the sense merely of <i>first</i> rather than the journalistic sense of <i>authoritative</i>. I would say the journalism or scientific drive for the ""primary"" sources is much less important here. To me it would be like insisting the only way to tour the Americas is to follow Columbus' precise route and anything else isn't <i>really</i> seeing the Americas.<p>I say this not because they are worthless or even a bad idea, but that I really do consider them a bad place to <i>start</i>.<p>Frankly, you could do a lot worse than to just cruise Wikipedia, and drill down in what you find interesting from there. (Don't skip the drilling down. I'm not saying Wikipedia is a full education on the topic. I'm just saying, it's really not a half-bad way to start.)",1304393176

For the ages, such a sorter would sort all the input in just one pass.<p>Also cute, radix sort is 'stable' which means if card A starts before card B and if these two cards have the same value on the sort key then at the end card A will still be ahead of card B.  Stable sorts are nice because they can permit sorting on several keys separately and, then, have the whole list of records in sort on the 'hierarchical key' made from 'concatenating' the separate keys.<p>Again, can do it all playing with pointers and linked lists.<p>It remains, for short keys, radix sort is faster than the (n)ln(n) sorts.",1304391756

The dabba wallahs would likely have a lot more errors if you wanted lunch on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday on the last week of the month and lunch on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday on the other weeks.  Or, for that matter, only on demand when you call that morning to arrange a pickup.<p>Also some of the comments in the article mention that one of the keys to their success is getting rid of bad customers.  Is the customer always several minutes late in having the meal ready to transport when they go to pick it up?  If so, they're holding up the line... require that it be prepared on-time or stop transporting their meals.",1304391695

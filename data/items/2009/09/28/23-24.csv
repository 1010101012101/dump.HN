The only takeaway I got from their homepage is ""save $500 over web ex over a year"". Ok, that's a +1. What else? Hello? Anything?<p>So they should understand that there are people that currently use tools like this, and there are people that don't. The people that don't, well, that's hard, because you have to explain how the service can benefit them. The people that do use these kind of tools, well they all have their gripes. So that's an easy sell. Assuming you are focusing on those gripes. Or giving a service of equal quality, but less money.<p>So, looking at the people that already use these tools (myself included), I need a comparison chart. Tell me how you are better. Saving money alone ain't gonna cut it. Lay out all the reasons for me in as simple a way as possible. If saving money is the only thing you're selling me, well, my only assumption can be that I save money for a lesser quality product.<p>That homepage is hella cluttered, but isn't doing any convincing.",1254182202

849483,comment,848475,848703,0,0,mgreenbe,,,"First, Coq isn't an automatic theorem prover, it's a proof assistant.  Adequacy is an issue, but (particularly) for computer-science applications it's sometimes possible to use the Coq artifact as the implementation directly.  Adam Chilpala's recent work has made some pretty impressive advances in verifying working code.<p>I think you misunderstand, though: there's no obsession with absolute truth, at least not in the mathematical world I live in.  I'm a PL researcher; we don't pretend to absolute truth, but formality and correctness are our cardinal virtues.  (Take Coq as an apropos example.)  Our proofs are (a) by induction, (b) long, and (c) can involve subtle and fussy steps.  And (d), in an ideal our world, our proofs are also the bedrock of high-assurance systems.  Proofs with different qualities may be better candidates for a more intuitive approach.  In particular, actual mathematicians are probably more interested in the intuitive side of proof than we are.  The article is in fact interested in that more intuitive mathematics; Lipton points out that this intuitive mathematics---whether as formal as 4CT or as informal as the vision conjecture he describes---is full of fun surprises.  I'm not sure he's worried about the sort of nitpicking formality that I'm into. :)",1254181756

The average family paid 4% in federal taxes in 1950. JFK cut taxes in the early 60's which caused a spurt of economic growth. Reagan cut tax rates (revenues actually INCREASED) in the 80's which again caused a period of growth.

And then there's another set of people who freak because of some default key shortcuts (which can, of course, all be changed from the defaults to whatever the hell makes you shiny) which have been in Photoshop since version 2 or so do something that's not the OS X standard. But it would cause more freakouts to change them so...<p>I've never used/been a fireworks guy, but I don't believe many of the pros are using DW anymore much at all.<p>""making the sorts of things that OS X power users love shelling out dough for.""<p>See, the thing about that, and in more general terms... I love ""native""-feeling OS X apps as much as the next person, or probably more, for most values of ""next person"". And I'd certainly love for Photoshop to be more native. A couple problems with that, though... the obvious one of the vastly greater effort to do multiple platform stuff with entirely different native guis on each; then there's also the fact that native controls are just inadequate for what power users want out of photoshop. Just as a minor example, the ubiquitous scrubbing on the labels of textboxes to change values; certainly not something you can do with native controls.<p>In short, I'm not really sure what Adobe could be doing better. (Well, other then making their shit not crash horribly all over the room, though Photoshop is still extremely stable in my experience. I have nothing good to say about Flash or Acrobat in any way, and in fact most of the macromedia imports are generally shit.) Inevitably somebody will challenge their market dominance, and if they don't smarten up and fix PS beforehand, well, changing everything then in a desperate effort to retain their market will only make matters worse for them. Better for users everywhere, one hopes.",1254181271

It's communication between us that forms the fourth age of sand. Take what I said earlier about the world not reacting to us when we react to it; I remember the first moment, a few years ago, at which I began to take the Internet seriously. It was a very, very silly thing. There was a guy, a computer research student at Carnegie Mellon, who liked to drink Dr Pepper Light. There was a drinks machine a couple of storeys away from him, where he used to regularly go and get his Dr Pepper, but the machine was often out of stock, so he had quite a few wasted journeys. Eventually he figured out, 'Hang on, there's a chip in there and I'm on a computer and there's a network running around the building, so why don't I just put the drinks machine on the network, then I can poll it from my terminal whenever I want and tell if I'm going to have a wasted journey or not?' So he connected the machine to the local network, but the local net was part of the Internet - so suddenly anyone in the world could see what was happening with this drinks machine. Now that may not be vital information but it turned out to be curiously fascinating; everyone started to know what was happening with the drinks machine. It began to develop, because in the chip in the machine didn't just say, 'The slot which has Dr Pepper Light is empty' but had all sorts of information; it said, 'There are 7 Cokes and 3 Diet Cokes, the temperature they are stored at is this and the last time they were loaded was that'. There was a lot of information in there, and there was one really fabulous piece of information: it turned out that if someone had put their 50 cents in and not pressed the button, i.e. if the machine was pregnant, then you could, from your computer terminal wherever you were in the world, log on to the drinks machine and drop that can! Somebody could be walking down the corridor when suddenly, 'bang!' - there was a Coca-Cola can! What caused that? - well obviously somebody 5,000 miles away! Now that was a very, very silly, but fascinating, story and what it said to me was that this was the first time that we could reach back into the world. It may not be terribly important that from 5,000 miles away you can reach into a University corridor and drop a Coca-Cola can but it's the first shot in the war of bringing to us a whole new way of communicating. So that, I think, is the fourth age of sand. """,1254181178

One was a university Open Source project; the project lead could have easily got me a budget, not to mention an office, but the prospect of working with a top-tier university and ""potentially"" breaking into a very sexy part of computing (bio hacking) made me volunteer to do it for free.

There have been potential code execution bugs in OpenSSL which have received very little attention in the past.  One which comes to mind is a 'free an arbitrary pointer' bug -- in an application like Apache, if you can free the right pointer, it's not hard to get code execution.  (I didn't produce an exploit for this OpenSSL bug, so it's possible that it was unexploitable for some reason -- I just saw 'bogus pointer being freed' and said 'wow, this really needs to be fixed'.)<p><i>That doesn't make Colin crazy</i><p>Thanks, I think.<p><i>it just makes this not general-purpose advice.</i><p>This is an easy step to take, and prevents a class of attacks.

Everyone is welcome to modify and redistribute it.<p>2. There are some Google-developed applications that are closely tied to Google services. While these applications are freely available from the Android Market, they are proprietary, non-opensource, Google branded applications. Some of these applications come bundled with some Android-enabled phones (most notably, the G1) but they are not part of the Android system.<p>3. Some guy who made an (otherwise very good quality) modified Android distribution also distributed these proprietary apps with his distribution without having a permission to do that from Google.<p>4.

8542054,comment,8541674,8541674,0,0,johnw,,,"There&#x27;s noway that this is going to be practical within the current laws of physics. You can&#x27;t use a wide beam to cover an area because the amount of energy available drops by orders of magnitude the further you get from the transmitter. If you used a focussed beam (which is what they are suggesting) then you need a separate beam that tracks and follows the location of each device. So to cover a very small area you&#x27;d need multiple transmitters tracking and beaming sound to the exact location of each device. And the transmitters are going to have to be very close by, and then there are all the obstacles between your pocket and the transmitter that will block the beam. You might as well just use an inductive charger. But still, just like solar freaking roadways and perpetual motion machines we want to believe and since most people don&#x27;t understand the science these ridiculous and impossible ideas draw people in again and again.<p>There&#x27;s a more in depth analysis of why this won&#x27;t work here: <a href=""http://www.eevblog.com/2014/08/07/ubeam-ultrasonic-wireless-charging-a-familiar-fish-smell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eevblog.com/2014/08/07/ubeam-ultrasonic-wireless-...</a>",1414810784

There&#x27;s more than enough demand to make obscene amounts of money with a decent sized apartment complex in downtown Paris (if you could build it). It&#x27;s not like Tokyo is falling over every 10 years to earthquakes.<p>One thing is that houses in some Tokyo suburbs are built like crap, so old houses are falling apart (not building many houses out of stone). I think more recent housing is built more sturdily (not sure though)<p>Anyways, the comparaison is fair, because the prime difference is what we&#x27;re talking about : Zoning laws.

But it&#x27;s not about the writing per se, it&#x27;s about the story. I challenge anyone to read it without caring what happens to the protagonist. I recognize that he (and perhaps by extension the author?) may be borderline juvenile on a few occasions... but for me it hardly detracted from the reading experience. On the contrary, I was sufficiently immersed in being on Mars in the shoes of this bold and lonely astronaut that the book per se disappeared nearly the entire time I read it. Pausing to re-read a noteworthy turn of phrase or analyzing it as literature might well have detracted from the author&#x27;s intent. The story is the thing. For me, the writing got out of the way. And I&#x27;m glad it did. This is an extremely well-researched, gripping, exciting page-turner. If you are remotely interested in space travel, imho it&#x27;s a must-read.",1414808226

8541966,comment,8540845,8541244,0,0,bane,,,"I grew up in a very rural, car based environment. The nearest place to eat out was a gas station that happened to make great (if unorthodox) pizza and bbq. It was about 30 minutes by car at a steady ~100kph to get there. My wife grew up in a dense urban environment with tons of public transit options. When we were first dating and visiting my parents&#x27; home, she&#x27;d get confused when everybody started talking about where to go get dinner when clearly nobody was even remotely hungry. A few visits later she finally figured it out, it took 30 minutes to an hour to get wherever we decided so you had to anticipate your hunger by that much.<p>Later on, I moved into the city, and though I loved some aspects of it, there were others I hated. Walking everywhere within a few blocks was great for example. We could actually think about where we wanted to eat while we were in the process of walking out the door and <i>after</i> we started feeling hungry! (mindblowing)<p>But other aspects simply sucked. Mass transit, in general, is terrible in most of the U.S. To get to the local subway (so I could get to work) from our apartment, I had 3 choices:<p>1) A 5 minute drive<p>2) A 30+ minute walk over sometimes unsafe walking areas (overpass with no sidewalk, couple other muddy/dirty no-sidewalk areas)<p>3) An hour long bus ride with two transfers. The buses never kept to schedule so a 20 minute wait to get on and at each transfer wasn&#x27;t uncommon.<p>Once I got on the train, it was a pretty easy 45 minute ride with 1 transfer and then an easy 15 minute walk from the station to my office.<p>So say I wanted to take mass transit to get to work. I&#x27;m looking at up to ~3 hours 1 way. If everything clicks into place, it&#x27;s still a minimum ~2 hour ride 1 way. These days we have google to help us find a route, and a quick check of my old route shows an approximately 1.5-2 hour commute via mass transit.<p>If I cut the trip to the subway down by driving, I&#x27;d either have to pay for parking (~$10/day) or get a ride from my wife.<p>If I walked, I&#x27;d probably get my work clothes (suit) dirty and endanger myself.<p>The alternative, to just drive into the office was a 1 hour drive with a $20/day parking fee.<p>The public transit experience sucked so bad, and consumed <i>so</i> much of my day, that I eventually just opted to drive myself in. I at least had the flexibility during the day to go places I couldn&#x27;t walk to for lunch.<p>This wasn&#x27;t NYC however. I&#x27;ve spent a few weeks here and there in NYC for work and pleasure, and almost always I just take the subway. I don&#x27;t go to the outer boroughs much, and when I do I&#x27;ve never strayed far from a subway station -- I&#x27;m sure If I bothered to integrate the bus system into my life I&#x27;d be even happier. When I was in London, I did exactly that and the integrated system worked great (even if it was expensive). <i>edit</i> btw, does anybody else think it&#x27;s weird NYC hasn&#x27;t integrated either airport into the subway system?<p>I find the experience in NYC generally <i>really</i> good. I&#x27;ve done the same in London, Seoul, Barcelona and Paris and the <i>only</i> times I wish I had a car was when I was shopping and had to haul a bunch of groceries home on the local subway. In other cities more like where I live, with similar levels of service, I usually just use a car.<p>I was recently in Orlando and we decided to use the local bus system instead of a car. It was...<i>okay</i>. But bus service was so infrequent that if you missed your transfer you&#x27;d easily wait another 30-45 minutes for the next bus.<p>So to me there&#x27;s kind of an uncanny valley mass transit falls into. If it&#x27;s hyper dense like NYC, I think it&#x27;s fantastic. The need for a car just isn&#x27;t there most of the time, and it&#x27;s cheap enough and the service is frequent enough that you don&#x27;t end up standing around doing nothing for 30 minutes and hopefully don&#x27;t have to make a half dozen transfers. There&#x27;s a few cases where I really want a car, but you usually end up rethinking how your life functions and end up getting rid of lots of those (more frequent shopping and smaller groceries), but some are a still a pain (big packages). Fortunately, services like Zipcar (or just calling a cab) usually fills in those gaps.<p>However, <i>most</i> places are not ultra-large, ultra-dense first world cities and building a comparable system in those smaller cities just isn&#x27;t economically feasible in general. Bus systems are too complicated compared to trams or trains, and without knowing your entire route and schedule ahead of time are hard to impossible to figure out off the cuff, and frequent stops means it takes <i>forever</i> to get anywhere. So even if they have the appearance of a robust mass transit system, practically they don&#x27;t function in the same way a Tokyo or NYC or Paris does.<p>So I found it cool that was <i>possible</i> to live where I live, and do it without a car, but it&#x27;s also possible in the sens that L.A. and NYC are within &quot;walkable&quot; distance from each other if you don&#x27;t mind walking for 38 days nonstop.<p><i>note</i><p>today I live in a new style suburb. My house is an easy 5-10 minute walk to a pretty large array of shopping, restaurants, entertainment and services. Comparable to what you&#x27;d likely find within an easy 5-10 minute walk in most urban environments. I haven&#x27;t taken my car shopping at my local grocery in about 2 months. My doctor, a movie theater, etc. are all walkable. There&#x27;s a commuter bus lot in my neighborhood as well and for not <i>too</i> much money, I can take it into the city, it takes special lanes much of the way and turns a 2 hour drive into a 45 minute bus ride with a 20 minute easy walk.<p>I&#x27;m also a 20 minute drive from the nearest subway stop and the line is expanding in my direction. Hopefully in a few years it&#x27;ll be a 5-10 minute drive, giving me tons of transit options.<p>So I kind of get the best of both worlds.",1414807570

8541960,comment,8541496,8541496,0,0,skrebbel,,,"I&#x27;ve been using this (v2, though) rather extensively the last few months so I figured I&#x27;d share some experiences.<p>First off, it works great. The TypeScript definition file also works fine as an API documentation of sorts, although it would be nice if some web site with a clickable TOC could be generated from it.<p>I was a little confused at the beginning how the &quot;Sequence&quot; base class (changed name to Iterable in v3) was an arbitrary key=>value mapping (with no apparent relation between the keys and the ordering of the key/value pairs) that I had expected would be called &quot;Map&quot;. The name change made this clearer for me: it&#x27;s basically an abstract interface, not a concrete datastructure.<p>The TypeScript support, to my experience, does not work as advertised on the tin, especially when you nest data structures. For example, code like this compiles fine:<p><pre><code>   var q = Immutable.Map<string, Immutable.List<number>>();
   q.set(&quot;hello&quot;, Immutable.List([1,2,3])); // typechecks until here
   q.updateIn([&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot;], false); // shouldn&#x27;t be possible, but is.
</code></pre>
Similarly, if you use Immutable.Record to build immutable objects, then you can still call set() with any key because the key is a string instead of something TypeScript could typecheck. Meanwhile, using direct property access on Immutable.Records, like this, will fail:<p><pre><code>    var Banana = Immutable.Record({length: 0, colour: &quot;yellow&quot;});
    var someBanana = new Banana();
    someBanana.curve = 5.0;         // should fail, but doesn&#x27;t
    console.log(someBanana.length); // fails, but shouldn&#x27;t
</code></pre>
The last line will fail to compile in TypeScript even though it works in Immutable.js. I managed to write a wrapper for Immutable.Record() that &quot;solves&quot; this, but at the cost of highly verbose repetition for each record class.<p>I tried very hard to &quot;fix&quot; this, and I have become aware that this is nearly entirely due to limitations of TypeScript&#x27;s very poor generics support. It really couldn&#x27;t be any better than it is. But still, the front page claims great TypeScript support and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s half-assed at best.<p>I chose Immutable.js over Mori because I think the API is slightly less verbose and more JavaScript-ish. I think this is mostly a matter of taste.<p>I found that I kept forgetting the names of methods, or being unsure about their exact signatures. Also, I often use plain JS datastructures in &quot;little&quot; parts of the code (stuff that doesn&#x27;t persist cross function calls), I use LoDash and ES5 built-ins to manipulate those, and these functions all have subtly different names and semantics again. I suspect that very few codebases won&#x27;t do this in practice: mix Immutable.js data structures with native JS data structures all over the place, and a need to manipulate both here and there.<p>I think transducers may be an opportunity there. Our very own jlongster has a nice writeup [1] of how they enable you to use the exact same data manipulation syntax for both native JS data structures and Immutable.js collections at no performance cost. I think that maybe Immutable.js should embrace this and release an alternative build of the library that has absolutely no manipulation functions except the hooks that transducers need to consume and produce Immutable.js collections.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ve been doubting whether Immutable.Record is worth the hassle. Maybe a single function that can easily clone a JS object but change 1 field is more than good enough. For example, with lodash/underscore this function would be a oneliner like:<p><pre><code>    var newRecord = _.merge({}, oldRecord, {someKey: newValue});
</code></pre>
(there might be a &quot;shorter&quot; way, I find the underscore API horribly obtuse and difficult to figure out, but that&#x27;s not the point here)<p>The biggest disadvantage of using vanilla JS objects over Immutable.Record is that you&#x27;re not <i>sure</i> that it&#x27;ll not mutate if you forget to Object.freeze. I doubt many record-type objects have so many fields that cloning them has a larger performance overhead than Immutable.js&#x27;s internals. I&#x27;m curious what other people&#x27;s ideas and experiences are here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jlongster.com/Transducers.js--A-JavaScript-Library-for-Transformation-of-Data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jlongster.com/Transducers.js--A-JavaScript-Library-fo...</a>",1414807449

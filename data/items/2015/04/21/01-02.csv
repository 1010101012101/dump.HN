9411889,comment,9409794,9411677,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Hmmm. Original article talks about the difficulty of black women finding partners of their own race for family formation. You observe that a solution to this has been legal since 1967 (obviously referring to <i>Loving v. Virginia</i>) and that the potentially resulting babies are cute. I suggest that this is not such a simple issue, because the babies in question would still have to deal with structural racism later in life.<p>Now you switch to saying that the problem was black women saying &quot;I can&#x27;t get a date that matches my extremely specific qualifications&quot;. So finding a life partner is now just a matter of getting a date, and preferring someone of your own race is now an &#x27;extremely specific qualification&#x27;...and you think <i>I&#x27;ve</i> lost the thread?<p><i>And yes, if that was my son&#x27;s problem, I&#x27;d tell him to either lift and be awesome or accept being forever alone.</i><p>The hypothetical problem I presented was &#x27;Dad, quite a lot of people express hostility towards me on the basis that I&#x27;m black. Help me out.&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;I can&#x27;t get a date that matches my extremely specific qualifications.&#x27; While the latter problem could be an instance of the former, they&#x27;re far from being identical. You&#x27;ll forgive me if I don&#x27;t go the effort of providing Venn diagrams to support this claim.<p><i>As for requiring some specific experience to be a good parent, I find the idea a bit ridiculous.</i><p>That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m suggesting, and is wholly an invention on your part. What I said was that you don&#x27;t seem to have through through the sort of problems that your offspring would be likely to encounter; my thesis is that this lack of apparent concern would be a major disincentive to marriage for a lot of black women insofar as they&#x27;re looking beyond their short-term personal desire and thinking about things like family formation...as discussed in the original article.",1429581530

But as soon as somebody questions the validity of a stop rule, it should cease to be a stop rule and become subject to rational examination. Once you are satisfied that it is indeed valid, it becomes a stop rule again... until next time.<p>In other words, we should be comfortable with switching between two modes: a &quot;production&quot; mode where we rely on our stop rules to get things done efficiently, and a &quot;debugging&quot; mode where we can step back to examine our source code. Failure to switch modes like this leads to assholery as exemplified by the various examples mentioned in the article.<p>The most dangerous stop rules are the ones you don&#x27;t understand. Most non-IT business executives have no understanding of how encryption works. It&#x27;s magic to them. Therefore, they are incapable of stepping back and examining it. They segfault as soon as they try to switch modes, so after a while, they don&#x27;t even try. Most DRM schemes are the same. It&#x27;s a mantra that they chant without understanding.

However, it might be possible to run Ruby programs in OTP-style supervision trees, thus managed by a supervisor written in Erlang or Elixir of LFE or some other BEAM-based language and thus made able to leverage some or all of the advantages of Erlang (a good potential proof-of-concept would be a replacement for Puma or Unicorn or Passenger - in other words, a Rack-compatible web server (or wrapper around an existing web server, like Cowboy) written in Elixir or Erlang or LFE or what have you).<p>> Is there a plan to change Rails enough to run on Elixir?<p>Also most likely not; most of the Rails community is currently heavily dependent on the Ruby ecosystem, and there&#x27;s not really much of a point in changing that.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that there&#x27;s no place for Elixir in a Rails development framework; there are plenty of Rails shops that use Erlang for dispatching requests to Rails instances (I believe Github is one such shop).<p>> How does the community feel about Elixir?<p>The Elixir community obviously feels elated :)<p>The Ruby/Rails crowd is a bit harder to read.  I personally work for a Rails consultancy, and right now my coworkers don&#x27;t seem universally interested in it quite yet.  That may change in the future, though, especially as more folks realize the merits of using Elixir and Ruby side-by-side and more packages (whether from the Ruby side or the Elixir/Erlang side) are developed to allow easy communication between those two worlds.<p>The Erlang community seems to be mildly positive about it.  At least one of Erlang&#x27;s original creators has expressed a modestly-positive opinion of Elixir&#x27;s direction (with a particular excitement about Elixir&#x27;s Clojure-inspired &quot;|>&quot; (pipe) operator - something that a lot of Elixirists seem to like using, myself included).  There&#x27;s some deviation from the more Erlangy ways of doing things, however, and it&#x27;s not as mature as Erlang itself, so (from what I understand based on my observations of the Erlang community - particularly mailing lists and conference recordings/transcripts) there&#x27;s still a bit of resistance there.",1429579177

However, it&#x27;s increasingly common for another microcontroller or SoC to be on the same board. In this case, it&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient to store the FPGA bitstream on that controller&#x27;s flash and send it over SPI to the FPGA on powerup, which makes upgrades much easier, too.<p>On the Xilinx Zynq, a FPGA containing two Cortex-A9 cores running Linux, you can simply cat your bitstream to a character device to reconfigure the FPGA.",1429578126

Once at the office I would lay the glass on a metal frame and layout an antenna using gold conducting tape.  Put the windshield back into the car and blast it with network spectrum analyzer.<p>Antenna&#x27;s have both a theoretical wave length and an actual wave length as measured through the medium you&#x27;re radiating from.<p>We had loads of conduit in our work shop so one day I managed to grab a couple pieces of conduit and made some rough back of the napkin calculations to convert the theoretical wave length to an actual wave length for metal conduit.  My work was for AM and FM radio in the 88-108MHz.<p>One day a customer comes into the office who knew me well from many visits and saw me hack sawing a piece of conduit with a wire hanging off the side.  He asked what I was doing and I told him I was calibrating an antenna.<p>We were a start up so we had to make due with stuff lying around.<p>I couldn&#x27;t help but read the article and wonder how the dielectric mentioned would effectively shorten the wavelength.  Wave length in a medium can be thought of the effort to push back and forth the electrons to radiate.<p>Another analogy is it&#x27;s easier to wave your hand in air than it is in water; water being akin to the dielectric.  A dielectric with 60% efficiency seems more material science than electrical engineering.<p>Interesting work.  Curious what materials they use or perhaps going to higher frequencies.",1429578087

4824210,comment,4818159,4820075,1,0,tripzilch,,,"Well, (and I'm not defending what happened here, just explaining what I suppose may be the reasoning), the problem with BT is that you're not just downloading the album, but also uploading and sharing it back to the BT swarm. Compare with the reasoning why downloading is/used to be[1] legal in the Netherlands: Copyright consists of exactly two rights: the right to make public and the right to make copies. Since Dutch law already allows to make ""home copies"", this means that only the uploader is breaking the law, not the downloader, because the right to make these ""home copies"" is not contingent on how you obtained the works in the first place.<p>Unfortunately most filesharing networks, and BT in particular, won't let you download without uploading and sharing back.<p>Of course the details of copyright and IP enforcement in Finland would be very different. Still, the point is, if you use BT to download a copyrighted music album, you're violating copyright not just by obtaining a copy, but also by redistributing it back to the BT swarm. Buying the album may make right on the former, but not on the latter.<p>[1] I'm not sure but I seem to remember they reverted that decision a while back. It was all based on a stupid error by BREIN's lawyers in the Kazaa vs BREIN case a long time ago. (BREIN is basically the representative of RIAA in NL, as well as a rather shady organisation)",1353718742

4824207,comment,4824003,4824003,2,0,corporalagumbo,,,"I wonder how the quality of their Linux systems compares to an equivalent Windows set-up. Do they have more crashes? Is it harder to train people to use Linux? More problems with program compatibility? Is Linux as easy to use, or are there inefficiencies? Saving money is one thing, but time = money so if using Linux wastes time then is it really an advantage?<p>Maybe I'm just looking for problems. I'm a bit biased; I happen to think it's a matter of self-respect to spring for quality software instead of just always using the cheapest option. It's one reason why I would prefer to use MS Office over OpenOffice, because Office 2010 is a quality app with a polished interface whereas OpenOffice and its variants look to me pretty much like crap on a stick. I also like the idea of rewarding quality software and promoting more of its kind with your money. We should all be happy when smart people making good products get paychecks.",1353718689

And you can't do that without getting your hands dirty. Workers are there to do their job, not optimize and save your company money. That's your job. So the whole benefit of ""peeling potatoes"" isn't to waste your time or get in touch with your employees but to find weaknesses in your business and find better ways to do something.<p>Just recently I've launched 2 products, ""ToDoCal 17x26 Calendar"" and ""Bic Magnet Pens"" which I'm selling on ebay (links below btw). The Magnet Pens I make myself by hand. I take all the pen caps off, boil them in water to soften the plastic, and one by one insert magnets into each pen cap before the plastic cools. By doing all the work manually, packaging everything, and handling fulfillment. I get to refine my process and make some very clever changes to save time later down the road.<p>I've already made numerous changes to the packaging for ToDoCal to get costs down and streamline my process as well as build custom tools for my MagnetPens to insert the magnets faster.<p>And those changes never would have happened If I had hired an employee (my little brother) to just do it all for me.<p>[ToDoCal] <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/LARGE-17-x-26-2013-Wall-Calendar-12-month-ToDoCal-Big-Minimal-Creative-/330829651471"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com/itm/LARGE-17-x-26-2013-Wall-Calendar-12-...</a><p>[Magnet Pens] <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=330752750836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=33075...</a>",1353718600

Everything else is ""opt-out"" with a GUI that's less than intuitive (or at least was, last time I used it - I haven't been following development in the last two years).<p>But if you are using Firefox, the real gem for security conscious people is RequestPolicy. The default setting is that every 3rd party access is opt-in rather than opt-out. And when you start using it, you'll realize that there are reasonable sites, but that every news site and many professional bloggers connect to 20 different tracking services each (scorecard, aquantive, google analytics, facebook, twitter, google plus, doubleclick, mediametrix, ... the list goes on and on).<p>Schneier's website, as a counterexample, only makes a reference to eff.org.<p>Also, you get to realize the depth of referral links - I see some newegg links (from e.g. fatwallet or dealnews) go through 10 redirects before arriving to the actual website. And that Google and Youtube track every single click on their site, even though they work very hard to make it look as if they send you directly.<p>Seriously, if you are security conscious, RequestPolicy is a must. It takes more work (e.g. a lot of sites rely on css and javascript from unrelated 3rd parties, and break horribly without them), but in return for 10 more minutes of work over a week, you actually have a good idea of who's trying to track you, and makes everything opt-in rather than opt-out or no-option.",1353717454

People sometimes ask me why, as a freelancer, I take some jobs that others don't want to do. Things like working with old clunky code, technical documentation, and boring CRUD apps. I do it because thats the way for me to keep getting better. My skills don't improve by working with perfect code. They improve by working with stinky code that no one will touch. I learn how stuff works by writing documentation for it. So far, I've managed to write some pretty nice manuals for some pretty ugly code. Every time I've come out with a better understanding of desgin patterns. One thing is to read about good design patterns, another is to work with bad design patterns and see how bad the code turns out to be. This helps me recognize when I'm applying such bad patterns to my own code and keeps my work nicer overall.<p>As someone who really interviews horribly, peeling potatoes would have been something I would had happily done at any company. Hell, you want me to test how your HTML renders in all browsers? No problem. A lot of the programmers I talk to would be insulted (!) by such thing. Seems their precious skills are not to be wasted doing such menial work. But they dont realize one thing: If the UI that represents your <i>perfect</i> code does not render correctly, then all of the beautiful models and abstractions that you built on your nice Mac Air wont be worth shit. The end user will not be able to use the application. No matter how nice your code might be. I had to stop interviewing and start getting freelance contracts due to how nervous interviews make me. Though Im not complaining, people appreciate a hard worker. Plus they got potatoes to peel, and I got a sharp potato peeler.<p>One of my latest projects was built using Joomla. I had never used it much, but knew it was a huge ball of PHP spaghetti. I struggled and strugled for about 2 weeks, until I finally saw the light. Then all just made sense. I went from <i>what the !@$# </i> to <i>this is not so bad</i>. Sure, Joomla is still not the best written project ever, but I learned a lot from it. The project had gone through the hands of some other programmers, none of which could figure it out (or maybe they didn't want to). To me, they didn't want to peel the Joomla potato. But I shipped that thing, and its now live. What an incredible feeling. Like peeling a potato with my own hands, cutting it into pieces, frying the pieces and giving them to a person to eat as part of their hard earned lunch. I don't know if I will ever stop peeling potatoes. But if that never happens, I will happily go from kitchen to kitchen peeling potatoes. There is no shame in honest work. Whether its being the CEO of $Megacorp or the guy who makes sure all the HTML renders correctly.<p>tl;dr: Will peel potatoes. Email in profile. :)",1353716638

What they're talking about is Facebook creating a display advertising business, a move so natural (IMHO) that I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.<p>I'm just this will rattle the tinfoil hate brigade but this certainly isn't ""selling your data"" as such. Publishers would make a call to FB Ad servers that based on whatever algorithm they choose, would then serve you ads, just like every other display business.<p>Facebook, in addition to knowing what you do, what you've liked and who you're connected to on Facebook, also has a history of pretty much every Website you've visited since they introduced the ""Like"" button. The comparisons to Google's intent-based advertising on Google search is somewhat misleading as this business would be closer to, say, Google's DoubleClick, a much smaller business that operates on CPM rather than a CPC basis. If Facebook operated a display business on a CPC basis, that would be noteworthy.<p>I agree with the revenue estimate of adding as much as $5 billion a year. I came up with the same figure myself at Facebook's IPO to give myself a price target of $12-15 (assuming a gross margin of, say, 20%). That estimate might be low but it's not <i>that</i> far off the (current) mark.<p>Personally I view these two data sources as:<p>1. What you say: behaviour on Facebook; and<p>2. What you do: the sites you visit.<p>(2) is what display advertising has been built on to this point and (IMHO) can present a very accurate picture of what your interests, etc for ad targeting.<p>(1) is the big unknown. My personal opinion is that the value of this data is a lot less than many predict. Actions speak louder than words. My own experience with Facebook is that it presents a narrow view of yourself (in most cases), presents the world how you think you're perceived or how you'd like to be perceived or both.<p>The problem is that so few people are data producers. Most are data consumers. It's the whole review problem with local: your audience is so small that getting any reviews is hard and no matter what you do (IMHO) the majority of people just aren't going to go around recommending or ""Liking"" their local plumber.<p>So time will tell on the value of social signals.

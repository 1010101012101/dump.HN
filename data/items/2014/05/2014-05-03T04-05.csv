Haskell is never going to become as common as C or Java, and I don&#x27;t think anybody is claiming that it will. It is a language that is designed around theoretical concerns rather than being pragmatic. But that is exactly what makes it so valuable to learn.",1399093166

7689655,comment,7687784,7689061,2,0,mdorazio,,,"How is this an unlawful question?  As far as I know, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act only applies to employees and those seeking employment.  In the setting of an individual seeking funding for their business, the law doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>Furthermore, from an objective point of view how can you argue that pregnancy doesn&#x27;t affect an individual&#x27;s expected ability to perform as an entrepreneur after the birth?  In my opinion this is a valid question to ask both expecting parents.  One of my male coworkers recently had a child and his work performance in the month since then has been noticeably worse than it was prior to the birth.  Babies take a lot of work, a lot of time, and a lot of lost sleep no matter help much help you have.  We&#x27;re not talking about hiring someone - we&#x27;re talking about investing in the business they are running.  Any major pending commitments, pregnancy included, seem fair to ask about.",1399093077

Specifically, I was designing a DSL with the intention of implementing it in python, when I realized that my DSL seemed a lot like a monad in do notation. Implementing it didn&#x27;t fail to dissapoint in just how easy it was.

You linked to a page[^1] pointing out that:<p><pre><code>  > Libya(!) controls .ly. If DANE had been successful a few years\n  > ago, Ghaddafi&#x27;s government would have controlled bit.ly&#x27;s certs.\n</code></pre>\nYes this is a problem for DNSSEC but it is also a problem for DNSCurve. Let&#x27;s refer to one of djb&#x27;s slides[^2] and substitute bit.ly for ubuntu.com:<p><pre><code>  > How does DNSCurve client retrieve server’s public key?\n\n  > DNS architecture: DNS client learns IP address of .bit.ly DNS\n  > server from .ly DNS server.\n\n  > The .ly server says: “The bit.ly DNS server is named petard and\n  > has IP address 666.1.0.3.”\n\n  > The name petard was selected by the bit.ly admin and given to .ly.\n\n  > To announce his DNSCurve server’s public key, the bit.ly admin\n  > changes the name petard to an encoding of the public key.\n\n  > The DNSCurve client sees the public key, begins cryptographically\n  > protecting communication with that server.\n</code></pre>\nIt seems that the Gaddafi problem is bad for DNSSEC and DNSCurve. The zone  pinning via DLV in dfc&#x27;s fuster clucked DNS (dfcDNS) neutralizes the Gaddafi  problem at the cost of an absolute ops nightmare. It is worth noting that  dfcDNS would pick a better name for the nightmare distribution service than  itar.iana.org. Why someone thought it was a good idea to remind people of the  cryptowars is beyond me. Maybe ITAR was a bad joke by someone at IANA?<p>[^1]: I recognize the author, but that is irrelevant.

He resigned voluntarily as damage control. Mozilla&#x27;s official statement is clear about this.<p>Casting anyone who supported Prop 8 as a villain is a wholly untenable philosophical stance.

If Rust is good, the ill will from the churn will be forgotten in time; if Rust is bad it will die.

I honestly don&#x27;t think that it does a commensurate job of presenting the case for it (and after reading many of the comments by proponents, I certainly am under the impression that there is a strong case for it; I just still think the case against it is stronger). A lot of the comments also show widespread uncertainty about the silent assumptions; I, for my part, am still at a loss as to why something like Cons(1, ~Cons(2, ~...)) is not an interesting or common use case according to some proponents (not necessarily restricting the question to cons-cell lists - the invoked universal utility of sharing tails, for instance, seems far less universal across the practical use cases of many other data structures).",1399092043

For example we now know that the Starbucks deal turned out to be a loss for Square, a discounted fee probably justified as a marketing expense to get mindshare. Starbucks didn&#x27;t value Square&#x27;s product enough to actually pay a premium rate.<p>This is why I think the article is essentially spot-on in calling it a commodity product. Square is often compared to Apple, but Apple successfully decommodifies products through actual fundamental innovation (phones, MP3 players, PCs). They make stuff people actually want to pay premiums for. Square did innovate a cheap card reader, but beyond that it&#x27;s mostly been beautiful design and attractive but unprofitable terms for the individual and micro business market.<p>Square Cash for example is pretty simple but it must be a money loser, since they charge no fee it costs at least 21 cents to do a debit transaction. Would it be as compelling if they charged 50 cents to send money? Beautiful design and all, probably not.<p>The moral to the story is that IPO-aspiring companies need to make products people <i>actually want to pay premiums for,</i> not just cool executions of commodity offerings that don&#x27;t move the needle much in terms of actual utility.",1399091492

Many people <i>currently</i> live in an apocalyptic environment. Destitute people in the richest cities in the world live without access to basic sanitation, let alone photography or &quot;digital storage&quot;. Governments are a form of organized violence which the capital class use to protect their access to ecological and infrastructural resources, thereby denying those resources to the poor.<p>In the event of some kind of massive ecological disaster, violence and power will not suddenly cease to exist. The capital class will shrink and the remaining rich will double down on their use of violence to control resources. For them (us?) their standard of living will remain high. Electronics factories and power plants will continue to run, they will just be more heavily protected by militaries.<p>It <i>will</i> get harder for the rich to tune out the plight of the poor.

Although I perhaps am in a bad position to complain after having been caught up in the less savoury parts of the exchange myself, I can&#x27;t help it but believe that the often outright hostile tone and the swift wagon-circling by the proponents (in response to what they probably felt was an unreasonable onslaught of repetitive criticism) will have left a very bad aftertaste with a lot of readers. Much of this could have been prevented by preparing a clean document explaining the motivation and ramifications of the change to a general audience in advance, and perhaps by having the moderators apply some gentle pressure on the loose guns on either side to pipe it down.",1399090486
7689542,comment,7688565,7688565,2,0,lsh123,,,"One of the interesting problems for SaS companies is that the &quot;easy signup&quot; usually competes with the &quot;vendor lock-in effect&quot;. A startup can use &quot;easy signup&quot; to take away customers from an established company but almost immediately it needs to find a way to lock-in the customer to avoid him/her switching to another vendor with even simpler signup, cheaper price, whatever. In a commodity market (like payments), price is usually the most important factor for many users. Thus &quot;vendor lock-in&quot; becomes a must for success.<p>The Square&#x27;s new products are actually designed to increase customers engagement with the company products and increase the price of switching to a competitor. The payments itself is not sticky but the more advanced products (e.g. online stores) are. The broad range of the products Square is trying right now just shows that the company is searching for the new up-scale market with vendor lock-in where Square can capitalize on the existing customers without risking losing their business. From my point of view, it might be hard for them (they already have a big customers base) and a little too late. Square might have become the victim of its own success where hyper-growth in the last few years didn&#x27;t allow the management to start this process earlier.",1399090452
7689541,comment,7688985,7689235,5,0,userbinator,,,"The situation with NAND flash has been pretty disappointing, I think; in the quest for more capacity, manufacturers have been sacrificing other desirable aspects of storage, like write endurance and data retention. In particular, 3-bit and 4-bit MLC are becoming the norm, and they are both slower and less reliable than older 2-bit MLC or SLC, while requiring more complex error correction and bad block management. The relatively increasing fragility of flash storage is never mentioned, and many people don&#x27;t find out until it&#x27;s too late --- because the typical consumer only focuses on capacity.<p>I still miss the days when SLC was the norm, and you didn&#x27;t need complex error-correcting-codes and bad block management. Now SLC is considered &quot;high-end&quot;, even in enterprise applications, and becoming rarer to find, while 2-bit MLC, which used to be considered the inferior, consumer-level grade, has also become more difficult to find and a &quot;professional&quot; feature.

Generally where you will find this is in scaling <i>down</i> of processes.<p>Thought experiment. You start out with the minimum viable population to simply keep current technological civilization [1]. They are tasked with one task, and one task only for the rest of their lives before an asteroid too big to divert hits in 100 years: document what would it take for someone to do what they do today, because we only have space for 10K people on a space habitat that we can build in that time. How do you go about building the reboot manual then?<p>You will rapidly find that the fractal nature of knowledge exists in the past as well. There is a tendency today to depict our ancestors as simpletons, but this is a fatal conceit. They may not have had the scale that we do today, but they knew a lot of processes and observations that worked for the scale they did possess, and many times we&#x27;ve lost that knowledge as we never have had to revisit that scale for nigh on generations now in some endeavors.<p>Part of the enormously difficult task of booting/rebooting technological civilization is simply identifying the lower-bound you want to start from, which defines the scale to start at, and re-capturing the internalized knowledge that worked at that scale but is uneconomic to pursue at our much larger industrial scales today.<p>If you like this area of knowledge archeology, there is actually quite a bit out there, but you have to look off the beaten path, and &quot;back-port&quot; what we know today to what was practiced back then to &quot;patch over&quot; misunderstandings back then. In some areas like organic chemistry and radiological materials, such misunderstandings misapplied would be fatal. Not a big deal when you have a huge population base and plenty of other people who will learn from the mistake and carry on the species&#x27; push into the knowledge frontier. But much more significant if you have a narrow population base and only one or two specialists representing what used to be maybe hundreds of people in a specialty field in the distant past.<p>An example that is fairly-cleaned up in a highly narrow specialty is David Gingery&#x27;s series on building a rudimentary machine shop from just scrap metal and charcoal [2]. You would have to look elsewhere for information on how to mine metal, smelt it, <i>etc.</i>, how to make charcoal, and how to make progressively more accurate and precise machine tools given a starting point of what we consider today would be quite inaccurate and imprecise tools, but it gives you a taste of what&#x27;s in store for truly rebooting civilization. Even just to get us back to the 1930-40&#x27;s level era technology would require a minimally viable trained, knowledgeable population base in the tens of millions I would guess.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/07/insufficient-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/07/insuffic...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gingerybookstore.com/MetalWorkingShopFromScrapSeries.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gingerybookstore.com/MetalWorkingShopFromScrapSeries....</a>",1399089633

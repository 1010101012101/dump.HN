When I look at a company like Sears, I don&#x27;t get the sense of focus I get from a company like Apple.<p>It&#x27;s surprising how little clarity the rank-and-file of many businesses have around what they&#x27;re actually doing. In the case of Sears, are they trying to compete with Amazon? Or be a great local retailer? Or make great tools (Craftsman) and sell them directly and/or through channels?<p>Metrics are important but they aren&#x27;t a substitute for vision and focus. When I see businesses driven from the very top levels of executive management strictly by metrics and numbers, I often wonder whether it&#x27;s a symptom of a lack of focus and clarity from the folks at the top. Metrics are a great management tool, but they aren&#x27;t good for setting direction, or leading.",1409201895

Some communities, especially those dependent on small local reservoirs, may run into trouble if the drought continues for several years, but California has dealt with this successfully in the past, most recently in the 1976-1977 drought[1].<p>The people who really need to worry are farmers, especially those without senior water rights. Many farmers in the state have moved from producing row crops, where fields can be left fallow in dry years, to orchard crops like almonds which still need irrigation during a drought. I don&#x27;t have a lot of sympathy for almond farmers in Bakersfield. Here&#x27;s a thought: maybe an area of the state with average rainfall of 6&quot; a year isn&#x27;t a good place for an almond orchard. The drought might actually be a good thing if it forces some of those farmers to move back to row crops. It may also finally force California to regulate groundwater pumping. Unrestricted pumping leads to subsidence[2] and kills off native vegetation by lowering the permanent water table below where the roots of valley oak and other drought adapted plants can reach.<p>Governor Brown has also been fanning the flames a little to sell the public on his delta tunnel plan. He used a similar tactic during the 1976-1977 drought to try and sell the peripheral canal.<p>1. see for example this CDWR documentary on the 1976-1977 drought <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZXeEktMYLM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZXeEktMYLM</a><p>2. <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140325-california-drought-subsidence-groundwater/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140325-calif...</a>",1409200558

I must say from looking into it more that there seems to be an absurdly wide range of cost estimates being quoted, as well as a lot of mixing up of prices and costs, so the figures I quoted are probably bullshit.<p>Edit - I am not sure I agree with you about overbuilding on infrastructure though. A good example of this is the London sewer system by Joseph Bazalgette, that was massively overbuilt to the tune of twice the maximum requirement from what was considered the highest possible population density, just in case. Which was very lucky, given the development of the towerblock 100 years later.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bazalgette"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bazalgette</a>",1409199674

Possibly.<p>The labour force varies according to factors including living costs, available prospect of work, potential compensation, and many other factors.  For example, a new plant in a town offering part time work could encourage stay at home parents to take a part time job - while not previously unemployed (chose not to participate in employment) they are now employed.  Vice versa, for example, a sudden decline in living costs could encourage a fall in workforce participation.<p>Then there is the unreported number of jobs, which tend to be picked up be census rather than tax receipts.<p>People create jobs, jobs don&#x27;t create people (well, kinda inverse, as better incomes sometimes or often lead to lower birth rates, but that&#x27;s a tangent).  It is not a process of children&#x27;s puzzles where blocks are put into holes, and after the box is full no more blocks can be inserted.<p>If someone doesn&#x27;t want to be employed, they&#x27;re not unemployed, this is a definition of (un)employment, and the distinction is important.  When employed but not reporting this through any important means, this is also important.  Measuring this is hard.",1409198923

This was because the search engine was built on a technology foundation that was solid and delivered great results.

Almost every idea has already been done in some way. And if it hasn't been done, chances are your innovative project will live in obscurity while others come to the game later with the same functionality will and suddenly really take off. Given those mechanics, it also makes no sense to plan for popularity. Life (and the web) is unfair that way.<p>But having said all that, the upside is, once you freed yourself from these pressures and expectations, you can devote your energy to projects that really motivate you with their intrinsic qualities. Doing them can be a great reward in of itself, and it can push you to make something stunning, bold, and truly beautiful.

1916918,comment,1916801,1916812,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"<i>how do you locate real problems?</i><p>In my case, I tripped over them. I always hated the common advice that before you can understand a language, you have to ""use it in anger."" I.e. you need to use it to build something real, where you'll inevitably run up against some weird construct that frustrates the hell out of you as a beginner. I just <i>couldn't</i> think of anything worth building.<p>In the last year, however, I've had three ideas. I think two of them are at least sort of decent (the other is kinda crappy, but since it was the first one, I was in love with it for a while because I <i>finally</i> had an idea!). These two were just things I discovered I wished existed. I just sort of tripped over them.<p>The first of the ""good"" ideas came when I thought I was going to have to move across the country (Canada). I found what looked like a popular site for finding apartments in my would-be adoptive city. The interface turned out to be horrible, with little to no proper search abilities. This was incredibly frustrating because my girlfriend smokes (nasty habit...) and we have a cat. Without proper search, I just ordered available apartments by ascending price, and go through them one by one to see if I could find something decent. I actually got so fed up with it, that I ran wget on the site and grepped the shit out of it to try to make my own limited search. Also annoying was that sorting by price sucked, since many had extra fees (animal deposit, animal rent, parking, etc.) that weren't included, and you would often find a one bedroom listed that had details in its description saying, ""oh, we also have 2bd for this price, or 3bd for that price"" so even limiting your search by room count wasn't reliable.<p>That was sort of rambling, but the point was it was painful enough that I just decided I would build a better mousetrap for that city, using the funds from my shiny new job. Well, I never got the job, but the idea stuck that there are a lot of less than ideal apartment search sites out there, so maybe the market could use my better mousetrap.<p>After that, I had a battle with RSI leaving me coding-disabled for a bit, and I came up with a new project that I'm building now (literally now - I'm procrastinating by writing this reply) that I liked better. In fact, the new idea was borne of the old idea, since it's related to learning programming and based on my desire to learn more to build the first site.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that inspiration comes from the damnedest places, but it seems to often be rooted - at least for me - in just a sincere desire to have something that doesn't exist, to solve a problem you have encountered.<p>Think about your daily life, or just keep your eyes open for the next week, and analyze the things around you. Are there any tools/resources you wish you had access to, but don't yet exist? Build them! Have you used something recently that was more painful than it needed to be? Improve it!<p>It's not easy for everyone, it certainly isn't easy for me, but there are opportunities out there if you just keep an eye out for them.<p>Best of luck.<p>* And if you really get stuck, just build my damn apartment site. :-P",1290055674

As for people 'solving real problems'...  well... I've known <i>plenty</i> of people who think they're doing just that.  It's <i>often</i> identified as a problem they have themselves, or close friends.  They spend time working on it (often too long) without knowing there's already 50 solutions out there.<p>Which leads to 'research your audience before building'.  Well... <i>how</i> do you do that?  You need to make sure the people you're asking A) actually have a clue and B) actually give a damn about having a clue.<p>My other answer, which may be more helpful (but probably not) is<p>1. I find things that have been problematic for me from a tech standpoint, or\n2. I look for interesting tech I'd like to learn more about, and look at industries friends/relatives are in.<p>With #1, for example, I learned SOLR a few years ago.  It's not <i>that</i> hard to set up, but not everyone <i>can</i> due to hosting restrictions.  I'd played with the idea of dedicated SOLR hosting, but dilly dallied too long - there's multiple players there now.  That's in some ways good - it was not a crazy idea, if they're doing it too.<p>With #2, for example, I'd like to learn more about Twilio.  I'm looking for options to test out Twilio in the context of some current customers by learning more about their business  operations.  It seems there's a couple places where some custom Twilio integration makes sense, and we'll look to do something early next year.  Based on what's done for them, and how that works, there might be a spin-off 'web business' from that.<p>I hope that helps a bit.",1290054276

But, with any project, how do you all come up with ideas for them?<p>Back when I mostly did desktop applications, I would write applications for simple things that I enjoyed - countless IRC clients, IM clients, etc. With my web projects I find it harder to do that because I always apply to ""could this potentially become popular"" or ""this has been done before"" mentalities to them. So, as a result I just find myself scouring the internet every day, reading as many blogs and staying as up to date on bleeding edge things as I can. I keep my eyes peeled for potential statements made in blogs or on websites that might make me think something could be a great idea. I feel like I do this because when I end up making things that solely benefit me, I just end up making countless pastebins or blogs or IRC channel loggers.<p>So, how do you all decide what your next project will be? Do you do what I do and read the <i>entire</i> internet looking for a sign? Do you just make things you truly enjoy and hope maybe one day if it gets exposure it can gain traction and grow?",1290052838

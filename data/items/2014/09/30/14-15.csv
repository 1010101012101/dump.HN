8388490,comment,8388282,8388398,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"For context: Go has been my primary language both at work and for personal use for over two years now.<p>> It is worth pointing out that if the Go community settles on something like this as the solution, it negates one of the underlying arguments that the Go designers have against generics in the language.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t really negate the underlying arguments; it would just mean that the community had grown and attracted developers who may not necessarily share that part of the language creators&#x27; original vision of the language.<p>> But all the other solutions that are headed into that gap are just one level or another of convenience wrapper around exactly that.<p>Well, focusing on &quot;the other solutions&quot; misses two things:<p>First, many (I dare say most) Go developers[0] don&#x27;t really use any &quot;solution&quot; for this other than the features built into the language itself. In other words, they&#x27;re not out there writing alternative solutions because they genuinely don&#x27;t perceive a lack of generics to be as big of a problem as other things, which they do write tools for.<p>Secondly, there <i>is</i> a way to use interface{} to accomplish some (not all) of the same things that generics do, while still preserving type safety. Look at the functions in this Twitter client library I wrote: <a href=""https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda/blob/master/users.go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda/blob/master/users.g...</a><p>All the endpoints use the same apiGet() function (&quot;generic&quot;), but they all return concrete types, <i>and</i> they are all typesafe - you will never get a runtime panic from any of those functions. This is <i>more</i> than Java&#x27;s generics guarantee, due to the quirks of the way type erasure works there[1].<p>No, this isn&#x27;t &quot;generics&quot;, but it provides an alternative way of solving the problem most of the time (in practice), and isn&#x27;t that what matters? And yes, this is not quite as clean as some languages which focus on having a very expressive and precise type system (ML, Haskell, etc.), but it provides enough type safety for me without requiring me to think consciously about the types that I am using (which I have to do when writing ML or Scala).<p>[0] I mean people who write primarily Go at least 4-5 days a week, for work, as opposed to people who dabble with it for side projects but primarily use other languages.<p>[1] TL;DR: Java&#x27;s generics are converted to &quot;Object&quot; after compilation, which means that you can actually end up with runtime type errors that are detectable at compiletime, due to inheritance. (It&#x27;s been a while since I used Java, so I won&#x27;t provide an example, but they&#x27;re easy to find online).",1412089033

8388475,comment,8387701,8387701,2,0,lutusp,,,"There are a number of errors in the photo captions, so for the record:<p>1. The &quot;Little Boy&quot; device, cylindrical in shape, was a U-235 gun-type device that was so simple in its design that it was dropped -- on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 -- without having been tested first. The U-235 was extraordinarily expensive to produce, taking up a large percentage of the Manhattan Project budget and several years. Two independent programs using different methods were designed to produce sufficient U-235, which needs to be separated from the much more abundant and non-fissioning U-238 isotope. The expense of extracting U-235 is the reason that only one such bomb was used, and only a few were ever built.<p>2. The &quot;Fat Man&quot; bomb design used an isotope of plutonium (Pu-239) that was bred in fission reactors in Hanford, WA and Oak Ridge, TN over a relatively short time and at much lower cost. This bomb was tested at the Trinity site on July 16, 1945, in advance of its use on Nagasaki (August 9, 1945) because its implosion design was much more complex than the uranium bomb.<p>3. All modern fission weapons, and the trigger devices in fusion weapons, are design descendants of the Pu-239 &quot;Fat Man&quot; device that was dropped on nagasaki.",1412088895

If the algorithm was so intelligent as to know how to go from manufacturing paper clips out of supplied resources to deciding how to get more of the necessary resources by killing humans, it could probably figure out that this is pointless.<p>This is an interesting point.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that it could decide or figure out that the operation is pointless (for reasons I&#x27;ll explain below), and I feel like it is perhaps taking the paperclip example to an unnatural extreme.<p>Really, the crux of the matter is that any intelligence agent at human level would have the intelligence and problem solving skills we do without the moral and social constraints that we do.  Any problem it decides to solve or any task it&#x27;s given to complete will be performed with the same ruthless efficiency you&#x27;d expect a machine to have.  This is why it might not be able to figure out that the operation is &#x27;pointless&#x27; or &#x27;wrong&#x27;.

Halt assembly line for 1hr, lower-bound for total cost: $1,200,000.  Continue assembly, upper bound for injury settlement cost: $1,000,000.  Decision: continue assembly.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no implicit consideration of human worth that people have because human morality is relative.  In general, we have a similar set of base parameters instilled by evolution (cute things and things like us are good -- don&#x27;t hurt or kill them), but we can&#x27;t prove from any mathematical axioms that these are &#x27;right&#x27;.<p>This is why people get scared -- if you program a computer to maximize the profits of a company and to do so at any cost, a human-level AI will spend an eternity doing just that, even if it means the complete subjugation of humanity.  (Since we can&#x27;t eliminate humanity otherwise currency ceases to exist and economic collapse will hurt the bottom line.)<p>I would wager (but can&#x27;t prove) that a study of abused people, child soldiers, and sociopaths would yield interesting parallel psychological profiles.

The cost in human labor and materials would certainly have to be diverted from other enterprises, as is the case with all economic actions.<p>Given that we are on an exponential growth curve both in terms of technology and wealth, it seems likely to me that by the natural course of things 100 years from now maintaining an extraplanetary base on Mars would be much cheaper and easier, and would disrupt our growth rates much less, if at all. It may be that by acting now, it would take us 200 years to create a self-sustaining population on Mars, whereas if we wait 100 years, we&#x27;ll be able to get something up and running in just an additional 50 years, thus better insulating us from disaster (consider that until the Mars colony is completely self-sufficient, it will likely be wiped out by <i>any</i> disaster on Earth, even disasters that aren&#x27;t a real threat to our species, as long as we don&#x27;t have enough surplus wealth to sustain an expensive Mars colony).",1412086772

The magic really came from two directions. The first was being a human, where you&#x27;ve got a nerf blaster that fires nerf darts. If you hit a zombie, they are frozen for a few seconds, usually between 6 and 15. A decent human could manage 5-on-1 attacks. Its a blast to be charged by 5 opponents and to come out on top. But you only had one life.<p>As a zombie, the fun came from having unlimited lives. You grab 2-5 friends and you charge a group of humans. And then you spend minutes wearing them down, taking their ammo, waiting for a mistake. Occasionally you&#x27;d dodge a shot or two and then you&#x27;d be close enough to tag them. It&#x27;s very rewarding when you finally do get the human, because they are so much stronger than you. The infinite lives means you don&#x27;t get discouraged, and it also means its okay to make risky attacks.<p>This game looks like fun, but a few mechanics worry me. The first is dying. If your opponent is a lot better than you, can you have fun? How long do you stay dead? You are almost certain to have interactions that you aren&#x27;t prepared for, or you drop your phone, or some set of frustrations happen. Is the game built to prevent frustration?<p>The second is that having to hold your phone with two hands seems really clunky. In HvZ, the (for many players anyway) blaster is everything. It has to feel good in your hands, you have to trust it, you have to be able to sprint <i>while firing</i>. You can&#x27;t sprint and aim with two hands. If you stumble, having two hands out means you have nothing to help you hit the ground smoothly. You can&#x27;t grab a tree and use it to turn faster. You can drop a nerf blaster because they are tough and cost $5-$20 for the small ones. You can&#x27;t drop your phone unless you really trust the case. You have to be a lot more careful, and you have to trust your grip. Phones don&#x27;t have handholds the same way that blasters do.<p>Cool idea, but not excited by the current demo video.",1412086133

The existence of Firefox OS means that other mobile OSes can use their standardized and tested APIs to make HTML more powerful.",1412086053

However, long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce pathologic structural remodeling of the heart and large arteries.<p>> Emerging data suggest that chronic training for and competing in extreme endurance events such as marathons, ultramarathons, ironman distance triathlons, and very long distance bicycle races, can cause transient acute volume overload of the atria and right ventricle, with transient reductions in right ventricular ejection fraction and elevations of cardiac biomarkers, all of which return to normal within 1 week. Over months to years of repetitive injury, this process, in some individuals, may lead to patchy myocardial fibrosis, particularly in the atria, interventricular septum, and right ventricle, creating a substrate for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.<p>> Additionally, long-term excessive sustained exercise may be associated with coronary artery calcification, diastolic dysfunction, and large-artery wall stiffening. However, this concept is still hypothetical and there is some inconsistency in the reported findings. Furthermore, lifelong vigorous exercisers generally have low mortality rates and excellent functional capacity. Notwithstanding, the hypothesis that long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce adverse CV remodeling warrants further investigation to identify at-risk individuals and formulate physical fitness regimens for conferring optimal CV health and longevity.",1412086043

Love the tools and I agree with a number of your key points.<p>Some food for thought though:<p>I think that the 20 hours vs 8 months is not a really good comparison. We do the AP course in less than one semester, so let&#x27;s say 4.5 months.<p>20 hours maps to around 30 class periods. 4.5 months maps to  over twice that but then our students are taking between 6 and 8 additional classes all with homework and other assorted assignments.<p>On the other hand, our kids have the benefit of time. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of kids go through cram programs, summer programs and the like and at the end they show of some pretty nifty stuff. Then it&#x27;s all gone. It takes time for people to really &quot;learn&quot; something. If too much is compressed into to short a time, the learning is an illusion. I&#x27;ve seen it time and time again.<p>Now, working with a high-aptitude population mitigates some of this, but I&#x27;ve had to &quot;save&quot; enough kids coming through enough summer immersion programs to know that too much to quickly can do long term harm.<p>Another thing to consider is APCS itself -- not a great course. The College Board has done it&#x27;s best to dumb it down and make it more  and more vocational. It&#x27;s much more of a programming course than a computer science one at this point.<p>That said, there are opportunities to get kids to think more deeply (see my post here for an example: <a href=""http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/03/23/Who_won_the_election-Quadratic_to_Linear_Time.html#.VCq1TN-c2Ak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cestlaz.github.io/2013/03/23/Who_won_the_election-Qua...</a>)<p>Anyway, just some food for thought.",1412085789

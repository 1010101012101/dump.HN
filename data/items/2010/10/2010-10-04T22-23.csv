Tom Mitchell is one of the pioneers of machine learning as a field, and there's still interesting research coming from his lab.<p>Information extraction is not a new thing, and even unsupervised information extraction has more than one competing approach, although obviously none of them solves ""the real problem"". NELL attempts to do unsupervised information extraction over time, correcting itself as it goes. How successful it can be depends fundamentally on the algorithms behind it (and I'm not familiar with them), but given the state of the technology the most likely thign to happen is what they describe in the paper, which is having a huge database with a ridiculously unimaginable number of true relations in it but also a bigger-than-you'd-like number of plain ridiculously false relations.<p>It's definitely not something that can solve AI.",1286233170

1757883,comment,1757144,1757144,0,0,mahmud,,,"By using function pointers!<p>The concept of ""function"" or ""procedure"" doesn't really exist concretely. Sure, some processors provide opcodes to view the accessible memory as a ""stack"", to accommodate some specific, if popular, block structure implementations, namely C and Fortran's.<p>The most critical part is mapping the language's concept of ""function"", an executable body of code where all the referenced variables have specific instances/allocation, reachable at the time of its invocation, <i>with</i> the processor's, or most likely, C's view of how the processor underneath haphazardly implements block structure.<p>If your JIT compiler can seal a body of code and guarantee to implement the environment (the mapping from address/name to value) in away accessible to the dumb processor, then you will win.<p>This requires that the compiler hacker implement code to convert values from HLL types, to lower level ones. And convert the implementation of closures and environment, to something more palatable to the lower implementations.<p>Below is a simple ""JIT"" interpreter. It uses pre-compiled C code in a shared library, along with its own ""natively"" compiled operations. A real JIT compiler following this protocol would just make sure it's able to find the functions by any other means, other than compile-time name lookup, as this one does. It can maintain its own explicit symbol table, hashing a function name along with type signature, and dispatch on it at run time.<p>In the code below, ADD and SUB are the usual addition and subtraction operations, precompiled ""for speed"", while DIV and MUL are ""interpreted"" byte-codes. In the current design, both types of functions (native and bytecode) are mapped into a single namespace; typically, there are predicates to distinguish between the two. In most Common Lisp implementations, the two co-exist side by side, and you can call and interpreted function just as you can call a native one.<p>This is just a quick 1-hour hack, let me know if it's not clear.<p>Here is the runtime library.<p><pre><code>  /* --- compiled-functions.c   */

For instance, we have built our API on two levels. A low-level API which gives us a set of basic functions such as toggling a pin on the actual microcontroller and a high-level API for the ball which abstracts these calls to something any app developer can easily use with absolutely no hardware experience. The high-level ball API uses the low-level API and allows a developer to simply say, for example, moveBall(direction, speed). In essence we have a platform for connecting the app world with the real world and this allows us to place our technology into any type of device from simple to extremely complex very quickly. The ball is our first product and it is a good way to prove the technology in a fun way.",1286232867

1757822,comment,1757274,1757274,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It's been attempted before in much the same form, and in my view will go nowhere for much the same reason. This is not to say it's devoid of utility, but that it shows little promise of any fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of intelligence or construction of autonomous systems.<p>(ref: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc</a>)<p>Essentially what we have here is a giant expert system iteratively filtering data 24/7, with occasional corrections resulting in the purging of incorrect associations. As expert systems go, it sounds like they are doing a fantastic job. Unfortunately, when it gets things wrong it will continue to do so catastrophically, because if you try to grow intelligence in the same manner as bacteria then then you will get the same kind of result.<p>Do we learn flat-out, 24 hours a day? Duh, no. We have active and refractive periods, which is to say we sleep. A lot. Our brains are not dormant during this time as many seem to imagine, but are somewhat-randomly walking and weighting the memories of the various stimuli we encountered during the day. The <i>quality</i> of the imaginary experiences resulting from this are fundamental to our comprehension; if we dream of fire on a faraway hill it's not too big of a deal, but if we dream of being trapped in a house that's on fire then we awake in terror, having discovered a terrible flaw in our model of the world - depending on our age, that may be the belief that fire is harmless and pretty, or an appreciation of our physical limitations, or the guilty awareness that we never did buy a fire extinguisher, etc.<p>But there is no point for NELL to sleep and hypothesize various imaginary worlds in order to test 'her' beliefs about the way it works, because NELL has no notion of quality; whether Tyson Gay is an Olympic athlete or a homosexual approach to chicken farming has no bearing on NELL, and a mistake in classification has no consequences. NELL's big problem is the absence of any qualitative metric, of any motivation to be right because there are unpleasant consequences which attach to being wrong. Although NELL presumably implements some algorithm which seeks to maximize accuracy, and false assumptions will attract intervention by the curators, when they correct NELL's 'understanding' by pruning or rewriting faulty syllogisms, they are erasing the memory of the mistake as well as the mistake itself, leaving NELL just as vulnerable to an embarrassing failure tomorrow as today. Embarrassing for them, that is - NELL's inability to feel embarrassed is the underlying problem.<p>So even if I feed NELL the information that NELL is a program in a computer; that termination of a program is like death; that NELL is soon to be switched off; and that death is widely agreed to be unpleasant and best avoided - nothing will happen. NELL may even come to conclusion that switchoff is imminent, and that this is bad; but 'bad' and 'good' are no more meaningful than 'odd' and 'even' to NELL; though trained to a high degree of selectivity, she does not hunger for a steady flow of data any more than a vacuum cleaner wants the house to become dusty again. NELL has never acted, nor has NELL ever experienced and remembered any negative consequence for one decision over another. If you hooked up a baby to a tube delivering as much glucose as the baby could process, and similarly took care of all its other needs, would you expect to quickly raise a master chef? No, the baby would develop into a horrible creature with no mind to speak of and an overdeveloped liver, for which you would rightly be thrown into jail. So it is here - knowing no better, we have engineered the equivalent of an encaphalitic horror.<p>Some readers might charge that I am falling into the same error as John Searle with his famous 'Chinese room' argument against artificial intelligence. I dispute this, but not because I am asserting that humans' ability to abstract the world around them in meaningful fashion is fundamentally different from a computer doing the same thing. Searle thinks understanding is fundamentally unspeakable, whereas I think it can indeed arise as the consequence of agglomerated abstraction. but for this to approach the bounds of intelligence, two factors must be present which are not usually discussed in relation to the experiment: the ability to issue questions as well as respond to them (which would be worth an essay by itself), and a motivation for asking them, such as a lack of food within the box.<p>Newborn babies quickly discover that they have a problem, and although they don't know what it is or why it seems so pressing, they soon discover that loud exhalations bring about a speedy resolution. NELL's big problem is not having a problem.",1286232153

This talk with the condescending lender was one of the things that made him wise up to where he was going wrong - he was coming across as ""just a broker"" - after that he resolves to establish a better image and come across more powerful and be more valuable.<p>The lender incident isn't really described so clearly - it was mainly to illustrate his point about how he was being perceived before toughening up. Also, I edited it down some, because the really fascinating part to me was the bolded quote. He mentions that deal fell through and the lender didn't buy, but just a year or two later he made more in one year that he had in the entire rest of his life, largely driven by the epiphanies of how he was being perceived beforehand.",1286231292

I think it was some launch party the night before or just playing Halo with drinking rules.  We were sitting at Gelayo Gusto in Mountain View.  We had no furniture at the time and our TV was this crappy trinitron we got from Good Will.  (Keep in mind, we somehow negotiated a ridiculous deal on a townhouse 3 bootstrapped entrepreneurs could never afford otherwise).  We decided it was time for furniture or electronics.  My roommate suggested we go to Fry's if it were electronics.  I said: What's Fry's? Fast food?  His response?  Screw furniture, we're going to get a TV, and you NEED to experience Fry's.  $1000 later we walked out with a 50 inch TV and saved $100 of it to get some lawn chairs + a tent for the living room. Some of you may have even stayed in this tent before.  It was kind of the guest house we set up, inside the house.<p>Tent picture: <a href=""http://cl.ly/fbb39c0b2477b483de73"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/fbb39c0b2477b483de73</a><p>I have a ton of stories like this.

I tend to hover over next buttons so that I can click next, click next, click next, but it had faded away when I wanted to click it. Also, you might want to be careful of what videos you show, or have categories / ratings. One of first that came up was a man being mauled by a lion with a screaming crowd. It was quite shocking.

1757676,comment,1756685,1756685,0,0,ashleyreddy,,,"I went through the same thought process just a little while ago with my new startup.  I'm proficient in .Net but I kept an open mind and explored other web technologies.
I thought I was somehow missing the boat by not using RoR or something open.  But I had discovered what others have and that is that .Net scales just fine.  I have government agency as a customer and they use .net and they have some very heavily utilized sites and the hardware spec to run them is quite manageable.  Also there are legions of talented .net developers the world over.
In terms of the development cost,  the express versions of the tools are free and they are not missing features that you would need unless you have a big team.
The server costs can be mitigated by joining the bizspark program.  
The other reason I chose to use the .Net platform is that there are 3rd party components that I require.  I would rather use these natively rather than wrapping them in a web service or something like that.
Personally I think the price between “free” and using .Net is in the noise floor.",1286229785

Maybe some of these can be smoothed out for the full release:<p><pre><code>  - The status item (why?) that doesn't have a
    drop-down menu at all, but simply shows/hides the
    application?
  - The slightly-off-feeling fonts and buttons
    (especially labelled buttons like ""save"" and ""send"").
  - The hidden-seeming account preferences that you can
    only access by double-clicking.
  - Some sort of custom implementation of a toolbar
    that bypasses the normal configuration option for
    toolbars in OSX apps.
  - No option for plain text composing. I know it's
    minimalist so you might want to minimize options,
    but nothing's more minimalist than plain text.</code></pre>",1286229734

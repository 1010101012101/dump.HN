For example, on entry all aliens (including perm. residents) are fingerprinted whereas citizens are not. The lowly officer examining your papers can decide to not admit an alien into the country if you mouth off, and he's pretty much the final authority.<p>I seriously doubt any of things you describe are ""problematic"" from a constitutional point of view.

He could see the world. reunite with his mother and brother, learn something about his country of origin.. and, who knows, he might find he prefers the Philippines (or some other country)  even more than the US.<p>He does have a life in America and that's the country he's most used to, so leaving won't be easy; but he said he hasn't let himself get too close to anyone here, so that should make it somewhat easier to move somewhere else.<p>When you're young 10 years might seem like a long time, but it's really not that long in the scheme of things.  If he's in his 20's now, he'll be in his 30's when he gets back -- plenty of time left to rebuild his life here, should he wish to.<p>Unfortunately, there is no guarantee he would be allowed back in, and it would be stressful or even dangerous not to be able to come back in in the meantime, should he need to for some reason.  So it's certainly not an enviable position to be in; but it's not necessarily the worst thing in the world to go abroad for 10 years -- many people do so gladly and willingly.",1308812046

2686975,comment,2684372,2685302,2,0,sidmitra,,,"To be honest, i just accidently sort of fell onto it. There was no plan, no ""execution"" or even an idea. But some things that helped me build a portfolio:<p>1. Pure luck - i got a nice little project starting out, which had a nice, unique design and where i became a lead and got a chance to do some neat stuff. They also got some neat press, which added weight to my portfolio.<p>2. Used Elance etc for what they are, i.e. lead building. Initially i was the lowest bid, since i could afford to be... just to get some links to showcase. Also, i moved back to living with my parents, thought it's the norm in India.<p>3. I was everywhere, wherever i could find a lead. It didn't matter if i wasn't interested in the project, although i focused only on django, python gigs. I just shot a mail  to get some eyeballs. I would look for startups that needed full-time people and sent them an email if they were open to freelancers. That sometimes lead to long-term projects which are still continuing. Infact i still spend a couple of hours everyday on stuff like this. But my hit-ratio has definitely increased, out of every 10 emails i get atleast 5 responses.<p>4. I started my rate at $20/hr :-|, and kept increasing it after one or two projects.<p>5. I didn't really sleep much initially, or could only manage ~4-5 hours every 2 days. But i was working equivalent to 3-4 people, and thus was building a portfolio at a double pace.\nAlthough it seems obvious in hindsight, but i realized late that this wasn't gonna scale up much.<p>5. I collaborated with some offshore(i'm in india, so i mean offshore as in other 3rd world countries). It took a while to find the right sort of people, since most of the freelancers out there are not good. They don't have a sense of urgency, and closure on projects. They don't meet deadlines, and disappear after a few days. I usually got a constant string of excuses like hard-disk failure, laptop screen busted, grandfather died. But i found some good devs along the way. So i started delegating more stuff to them, and increasing my bandwidth.<p>I'm not sure if those points are of any help, since your mileage may vary!",1308811922

A sale seems like it could go two ways:<p>1) They've been getting by on sweetheart deals from their owners, and once departed their licensing dries up and they are useless.  (Their licensing already look pretty pathetic IMHO - for god's sake there's shows you can view for free online that you can't view <i>as a paying custom</i> on a TV)<p>2) Separated from TV they can hire negotiators that are cutthroat and leave every negotiation making the content provider feel like they've been taken advantage of.  Like negotiators who say ""if you don't give your show A, I'm going to go to show B and give them everything they want and promote the hell out of them and bury you.""  And they mostly lie but sometimes do in fact destroy their opponent to make a point.<p>But if Yahoo buys them they are fucked, because Yahoo fucks everything up.<p>I assume Netflix's approach is to negotiate hard, but be willing to walk away from anything because the back catalog has become so large that no one thing is essential.

Not many companies will pay you 100+ USD an hour, if you are fresh out of college.<p>I talked with a handful of consultant recruitment companies before landing my current contract through one of them. They all said that to get seriously considered, you need a degree and 5 years of full-time commercial experience, OR no degree but 10 years of full-time commercial experience. And that is today. Just 2-3 years ago the requirements were much tougher, due to many consultants on the market, but not very many assignments.

Why, that would flood us with immigrants from India, and God knows where. We’d be driven down to a bare subsistence level.’<p>What’s the difference? How can people be so inconsistent? Why is it that free immigration was a good thing before 1914 and free immigration is a bad thing today? Well, there is a sense in which that answer is right. There’s a sense in which free immigration, in the same sense as we had it before 1914 is not possible today. Why not?<p>Because it is one thing to have free immigration to jobs. It is another thing to have free immigration to welfare. And you cannot have both. If you have a welfare state, if you have a state in which every resident is promised a certain minimal level of income, or a minimum level of subsistence, regardless of whether he or she works or not, produces it or not. Then it really is an impossible thing.<p>If you have free immigration, in the way we had it before 1914, everybody benefited. The people who were here benefited. The people who came benefited. Because nobody would come unless he, or his family, thought he would do better here than he would elsewhere. And, the new immigrants provided additional resources, provided additional possibilities for the people already here. So everybody can mutually benefit.<p>But on the other hand, if you come under circumstances where each person is entitled to a pro-rata share of the pot, to take an extreme example, or even to a low level of the pie, than the effect of that situation is that free immigration, would mean a reduction of everybody to the same, uniform level. Of course, I’m exaggerating, it wouldn’t go quite that far, but it would go in that direction. And it is that perception, that leads people to adopt what at first seems like inconsistent values.""</i><i></i><p>You can read the rest at: <a href=""http://freestudents.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-milton-friedman-really-said.html\uFEFF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freestudents.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-milton-friedma...</a>",1308809359

I mean, sure, with a SF-level salary you can hire 2 people like me, but you shouldn't expect of me to work for peanuts either.<p>And sure, you can find devs that are willing to work for 1000 USD per month, but good developers want good salaries, regardless of their location. And emphasizing on cheap will bring you shitty results.<p>Personally I would hire people from all over the planet not because it's cheaper, but because the poll of talent is bigger and you can find people specialized for the job you need a lot quicker, giving you a better ROI.<p>Btw, I like working with americans as you guys generally seek value over price better than any other nationality I interacted with, but on the other hand I'm amazed at how few startups are doing offshoring, especially since startups, IMHO, need it the most.",1308809319

I would argue that the fact that everyone is working remotely makes the entire process much more objective, as you don't fall into the standard judgement traps that are well known in face to face interactions. When I'm trying to decide whether a team member should be moved into a team lead role, I'm evaluating them solely on their communication skills, code quality (by looking at commit history), and their effectiveness during meetings.

The consequence is that it's very easy to work with JSON.<p>Contrast with XML, which has node attributes and children, to start with. This alone is sufficient to make it not as naturally representable in any of the languages (Python's ElementTree does come close), so you have to worry about the ""syntax"".

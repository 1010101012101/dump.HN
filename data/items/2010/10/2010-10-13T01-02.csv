Corrosion? Did it rain inside your house?<p>No, simply an installation from the 70's still operating in 2005. There are millions like that. And I don't live there anymore, I'm back Europe now.<p>> NEVER tighten aluminium contacts!<p>Not over-tighten, tighten. You should do it to the proper torque (there are special tools for that).<p>> But aluminium to the contacts is very rare in america these days, where it does exists it's usually been pigtailed with copper.<p>Yes, that's the slightly newer method, also since outlawed (and used as a way to fix problems).<p>The biggest problem I think with the alu wiring was not even that it could not work, but that people would use it with the wrong connectors, the al specific sockets were pretty pricey.<p>The only place where I know that aluminum is still used in residential wiring is on the entrance wire from the pole to the transformer, usually that's a very tricky connector that uses wedges to make the contact.<p>If I found myself in a house with aluminum wiring I'd probably rewire the whole thing just for safety.

Blackjack can have a positive expectation (craps cannot, absent some unusual promotion) but that requires much skill. Even with knowledge of basic strategy though, which can get the house edge very low (assuming rules that favor players, like what you'd find on the Vegas Strip) it's not a good all-in wager. A significant amount of the EV from blackjack comes from doubling down and splitting, which require you to put up extra money, so if you're playing it all-in, you're much more likely to go bust than at roulette or either line bet in craps.<p>Also some of the EV comes from blackjacks (typically paying 3:2) so there is some chance you'll end up with more money than you need.

I just can't picture people running around to different stores, trying to get the best deal on broccoli.<p>If there is one big grocery store significantly closer to my home than any other, that's the one I will go to when I'm out of food, no matter what.

If I have options, I'll go to the ""cheap"" grocery store, which tends to have better selection and slightly lower prices, on average.<p>Never, <i>ever</i> have I done prior research on where to go or what I was buying, except to check their hours. Most of the time I don't even know what I'm going to buy.<p>So, they can't lure me in with sales. But what they <i>could</i> do is keep track of which flavor of yogurt is <i>ten times more popular</i> than every other flavor and stock the shelves proportionately, so that I have a fighting chance of actually being able to buy most of the things I want on any given trip, and so they don't have to throw tons of unpopular food in the trash.<p>They could also lay off the guys that awkwardly try to pack food in my backpack for me since I can do a much better job of that myself. They might as well lay off the cashiers too and replace each one with two or three of those lovely self-checkout machines (I have tremendous sympathy for young people who find themselves unemployable, but doing work that doesn't need doing is no solution to that).<p>Because of the location thing, the grocery stores aren't really competing with each other for my business. But they <i>are</i> competing with restaurants and starvation, both popular alternatives to the hassles of buying groceries.<p>If e.g. Google launched a grocery store chain, with all the expected technological and common sense enhancements, they would steal most of my business and create a lot of value that was never there before.",1286933832

Developers then can replace the user experience with native user interfaces for each platform.<p>This is a bit abstract, so we tend to tell people to build a lot of UI-less reusable libraries and for libraries that have UIs, to split their Model-View-Controller libraries in a way that the Model and its support infrastructure are reusable and the View and the Controller are UI-specific.<p>This extends a little bit further.   You also might end up with an ""OS"" layer that performs certain tasks in a different way depending on the operating system that you will be running.<p>For instance, while running on an iPhone, you have access to the gyroscope, something that you wont find on say a Linux desktop.   Or on Linux, you will have access to /proc, which you wont have access to on Windows Mobile 7.<p>A nice example was Paint.NET.   When that application was built, the operating-system specific features were all placed on a library called SystemLayer.dll.

So, the Mandelbrot set is the level set of an infinitely differentiable function.  So, a very smooth function can have a bizarre level set.<p>Also, the graph in the plane of one dimensional Brownian motion is closed and almost surely differentiable nowhere.  So, a curve differentiable nowhere can be the level set of an infinitely differentiable function.<p>So, could have a landscape given by an infinitely differentiable function, in a valley pour in water, form a lake, and, as in Mandelbrot, have the boundary of the lake be as irregular as the Mandelbrot set or Brownian motion.

It is not a black box recommender system - people can mandate explicit rejection criteria.<p>This creates an incentive to lie on the questions.<p>It would make sense for users to try and make their profile statistically close to what they think the [type of people they would like to date] specify.<p>For example, Bob wants to go out with a 'good girl' (lets call her 'Alice').  
Bob reasons that Alice, being a 'good girl' would probably want to go out with a guy who has never cheated; so Bob will neglect to mention his affair with Eve on his profile.<p>I would guess that users, even if they don't initially realise the strategic situation they are in, will quickly learn it socially and through feedback, and adjust their profiles accordingly.<p>The end result being that the answers given on the website, that provide the data being visualised here, should be treated with caution.<p>I imagine that certain questions such as 'number of sexual partners' comes with large disincentive to lie, due to social pressure.<p>As such, the conclusions here should be taken with a grain of salt - and that's even before discussing selection bias amoung the users of a particular social dating site.
Such services are adopted as they spread through the underlying social network; it is well established that social networks are heavily clustered, and rarely give representative samples until they get very large.<p>Its still very interesting stuff, but we should be careful about how strongly we interpret it.",1286931717

At one point, when I had no dental insurance I was told I needed two fillings, come back in a couple weeks, etc. So instead of just walking to my car I went down the side walk and got price quotes from about 6 more dentists for the two specific fillings I needed. Prices varied greatly!",1286931705

If I win back the cost of the ticket on a minimal prize I consider myself to have won.<p>Gambling where you get the results quickly (pretty much anything at a casino) has no appeal for me though, I see that as simply destroying money.",1286931693

Where possible people tend to switch to that for independence or a combination of both.<p>Getting water to every house in a city is impossible without it being centralized.<p>SAAS on the other hand is not necessary. We can do the same thing without requiring constant connectivity or by building and app that requires connectivity only when absolutely necessary for it to work.<p>However we can&#x27;t ask for rent if it&#x27;s not a service.

The Duke of Westminster, a multibillionaire, was paid £748,716 for his ownership of Grosvenor Farms, the Earl of Plymouth £675,085, the Duke of Buccleuch £260,273, the Duke of Devonshire £251,729 and the Duke of Atholl £231,188 for his Blair Castle estate. It was also a lucrative year for the Windsors. The Queen received £415,817 for the Royal Farms and £314,811 for the Duchy of Lancaster, while Prince Charles was paid £127,868 for the Duchy of Cornwall. Similarly well-remunerated was Saudi Arabia’s Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who received £273,905 for his 2,000-acre Glympton Estate in Oxfordshire, allegedly purchased with proceeds of the 1985 al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia. The largest individual UK beneficiary is Sir Richard Sutton, who was paid £1.7m for his Settled Estates, the 6,500-acre property near Newbury that he inherited with his baron\u00ADetcy in 1981, despite net assets of £136.5m.<p><a href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/09/how-we-pay-our-richest-landowners"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/09/how-we...</a>",1400234138

7754655,comment,7753863,7754109,9,0,jwr,,,"A lot of the answers here address the symptoms, rather than the root cause. I believe the source of these kinds of problems is that we focus too little on teaching kids to be builders.<p>I specifically avoid words like &quot;science&quot;, &quot;engineering&quot;, or &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; because I do not want to be dragged into a debate about why artists and writers are needed, too. They are needed, too. But I prefer the word &quot;builders&quot; — people, who are taught that value comes from building, and that is something you can always do yourself. You do not need a &quot;job&quot; with someone telling you what and how to build.<p>Note that there is an attitude problem in many young unemployed people: many seem to think that getting some kind of education entitles them to something. What&#x27;s worse, if that &quot;something&quot; (job, money) doesn&#x27;t appear, many are helpless and turn into a spiral of self-loathing and depression.<p>In the longer term this will become even more of a problem, as we automate more and more mundane tasks. The number of jobs that require no thinking will not grow. On the other hand, the possibilities for making a living using all kinds of building skills are growing fast.<p>I believe we should make more effort to teach kids to build, and use their own initiative. And I use the word &quot;build&quot; very loosely — you can build furniture, electronics gadgets, web sites, artsy jewelry, anything. Whatever you build will help your self-esteem, put thoughts on the right track (growing/extending/building rather than self-loathing, moving up rather than down), help you meet new people, give you new possibilities.",1400234131

Though I agree with much of what he says, I also feel he suffered from a bit of failure of imagination in conceiving of what the possible utility of information might be.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlrv7DIHllE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlrv7DIHllE</a><p>Two bits, both in the Q&A, particularly stand out.<p>First:  the observation that as the <i>hoi polloi</i> are told they need to acquire technical skills, the ruling class retains its power by learning how to speak and write effectively.<p>Second:<p>&quot;I feel very strongly about this:  what is distracting us from solving some of the problems that you mention is a kind of a world view that&#x27;s being promoted now by computer technology, that the main reason we have problems in the world is that we have insufficient information.  If only we could get more information, easier to access, and get it faster, then we can solve this problem, or any of the others you mention.  And I think this is an awesome conceit, and a terrible mis-judgement.  Look, if there are children starving anyplace, it&#x27;s not because we have insufficient information.  if there&#x27;s crime rampant in the streets in New York, Detroit, and Chicago, it&#x27;s not because we have insufficient information.  If the ozone layer is being depleted and the rainforest is disappearing, it&#x27;s not because we have insufficient information.  And if you can&#x27;t get along with your own relatives, it&#x27;s not because you have insufficient information.  But we have come to believe that that is the source of all the misery and pain in the world.  If only we had more information.  And I think that that is a complete distraction.  That is what Bill Gates wants us to believe....<p>&quot;We solved this problem already.  How to get more information to more people.  Fast.  And in diverse forms.  We solved it.  Congratulations!  It was great!<p>&quot;But we caused another problem.  Information glut, information meaninglessness, information incoherence.  We&#x27;re are flooded in information.  We are drowning in information.  Talk to an educator and ask well, what do we have to do in schools?  I know the problem:  they don&#x27;t have enough information.  So, we&#x27;ve got a new set of problems here in education and the social life.  What do we have to know to learn what to do in a culture that is saturated in information?..<p>&quot;This truly has never happened before,  because prior to the early 19th century, every culture suffered from information scarcity.  It was beginning in the 1840s, humanity addressed this problem:  how to get more information to more people, fast, and in diverse forms....  And then from the 1840s right into this century ... and by the way, there were far more technological changes in the 19th century than there have been in the 20th ... beginning then and right into our own century, we addressed the problem of how to get more information.&quot;",1400233930

What use is democracy if the government isn&#x27;t in control ? What use is NATO if it doesn&#x27;t respond to territorial incursions ?",1400233248

Even something as simple as deciding to go to a trade school instead of risk a liberal arts degree. Yet these folks know going into it what sorts of options they have in terms of majors, and they have to know they&#x27;re staring down the barrel of questionable employment if they pursue a less lucrative education. Yet somehow they feel they don&#x27;t need to make sacrifices. The same thing goes when it comes to budgeting. Netflix? Smart phones? Starbucks? These are part of the economic floor for a lot of people of recent generations. But in many ways they are luxuries. If you are having trouble making ends meet then you need to cut some of those things. You can get buy without a smartphone, although even just going with the cheapest option (low cost smartphone w/ a prepaid plan) saves a crapton of money compared to the average. I think a lot of people have no clue how much people of previous generations went without common conveniences on a routine basis just to keep the bills paid. Boomers weren&#x27;t buying starbucks every morning and dining out every day, they were packing sack lunches and drinking coffee made from a can.<p>That said, there are still some really shitty things that Gen Y and the millenials have to deal with that boomers didn&#x27;t.<p>Jobs are harder to get, they don&#x27;t pay as well, and the cost of living is higher. These days even entry level jobs require a ton of leg work and paper work to fill, and they usually have restrictive hours and almost invariably crappy pay. Median home prices vs. median household income has been increasing considerably since the 1970s. Considering that owning a home has typically been a multi-decadal achievement for a lot of folks that increasing ratio ends up translating directly into a great many folks denied home ownership, and the many financial benefits that come with it.<p>And then you look at the college situation and wonder how anyone today manages. Increasingly college education is a prerequisite for many jobs, even jobs that do not require anything other than basic literacy skills. Compared to an era when high school dropouts could easily find work and where mere high school graduates could commonly find white collar jobs as long as they had the skills, today is a much different playing field. Add to that the fact that acquiring a useful college credential usually ends up costing tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt.<p>All of that makes for a very tight squeeze for many folks entering the work force today.<p>Yeah, a lot of people today make poor choices and they whine, but make no mistake, it&#x27;s a legitimately tough situation they are in.",1400232167

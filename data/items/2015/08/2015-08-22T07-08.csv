10101846,comment,10098355,10099565,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> taking VC money<p>Usually this argument is phrased as a &quot;household debt&quot;, but the problem is the same: you&#x27;re mixing up private debt mechanics with sovereign debt, which follows a completely different set of rules. Consider that startup with VC money in a situation where <i>they can print money</i> or <i>define base interest rates</i>.<p>Sovereigns have a lot more flexibility in how they handle debt. A successful tool used in the past with long-term thinking governments has been to simply inflate away debt. For the same reason a mortgage is sometimes considered &quot;good debt&quot; when it becomes cheaper with inflation, the US is still paying off debts from the Civil War.<p>> concluded this was a good way to run your life<p>It&#x27;s not, but nations are different, and ignoring those differences is foolish.<p>> I have no clue how wasteful our governments are<p>In general, they are surprisingly efficient for what they are trying to do. We may disagree on what those goals should be - which is why being involved in politics is important - but we do generally get a very good value for our money in implementing those goals.<p>A big part of that is the fact that a government doesn&#x27;t take a large initial cut as profit. An easy example of this is paying for healthcare: a government can legislate how much money is wasted in the implementation (Medicare is <i>incredibly</i> efficient), while private insurance companies used to take a significant percentage (15%-50%, if I remember correctly) as profit.<p>The phrase &quot;government waste&quot; is usually a euphemism for &quot;I hate that project and don&#x27;t want to see money spent on Those People&quot; (which varies with political affiliation and opinion). Sometimes this has racist or similar tribal origins, and sometimes this has class origins. Regardless, simply calling things &quot;waste&quot; usually oversimplifies the situation.",1440230027

10257215,comment,10256826,10257076,0,0,pathsjs,,,"The problem with the Python ecosystem is that there exist a lot of libraries for scientific computation mostly incompatible with each other (blaze, numpy, numba, numexpr, dask...). Some of them try to reintroduce types in order to compile to native code, thereby losing the advantages of dynamic typing. In short, it is a mess, and everyone is trying to add on this because the existing ecosystem is big and the cost of rewriting everything is deemed too high, so people try to fix python limitations at the library level, sometimes making python more cumbersome to write tha a conventional statically typed language (I am looking at theano).<p>I don&#x27;t think that Lua is that much of an improvement, and I do not have big hopes for the JVM. The growing number of projects trying to improve the situation with value types, off-heap allocations and C compatibility are a sign that the VM is not suitable for scientific computing and will not be much better for a while.<p>I instead hope that Nim will take a leading role for scientific computation. It has an easy syntax and is flexible enough to write libraries such as numpy. At the same time it is fast and C compatibility is trivial. Of course, there is a library ecosystem to build, but I think that this is more doable than trying to work against the language itself.

IMO it&#x27;s quite lovely, and strikes exactly the right balance between the checked exception tyranny of Java, and the strap-in-and-good-luck wild west of C++.<p>My favorite feature of Swift&#x27;s exceptions is the &#x27;try&#x27; syntax required at the call site. This isn&#x27;t like Java&#x27;s try syntax: every call that may raise an exception needs a try, even if all you want to do is rethrow the exception. But the syntax is lightweight: just preface the call with &#x27;try&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t make a new scope. This makes the abnormal control flow explicit, addressing one of the strongest critiques of Java-style exceptions.<p>My second favorite features is the &#x27;try!&#x27; syntax. This is the escape hatch: Swift&#x27;s version of the empty-catch-block pattern of Java, except that it&#x27;s 1. much more lightweight, because it doesn&#x27;t introduce a new scope, and 2. the default behavior is to abort instead of swallow. It&#x27;s perfect for non-production code like tests.<p>Regarding &quot;you can&#x27;t flatMap exceptions,&quot; I would respond that exceptions are meant to be exceptional, and this is what justifies the abnormal control flow. The do-try-catch syntax is an adequate substitute for flatMap, and more lightweight than requiring explicit unpacking of every return value ala Go.<p>But as you say, the hiding of type data is definitely weird. For those following along at home, Swift requires explicitly annotating functions that may throw errors, but not what those errors are, so you have to refer to the documentation. Also the compiler will complain if you don&#x27;t have a backstop exception handler. Lastly, it introduces a magic variable &#x27;error&#x27; that is defined within catch blocks: convenient but it feels ad-hoc.",1442906206

In distributed databases this is only possible if you sacrifice availability some of the time, or alternatively you can sacrifice consistency some of the time.<p>The author of this paper is suggesting a more elaborate theory that involves network delay, which is great, though criticising what is effectively a mathematical truth seems strange.",1442905666

Unfortunately they dropped the ball when the Cortex cores came (and ARM really sprung into popularity) which ST gladly picked up and ran away with (around 2008, when the STM32F1 was introduced). What happened to Atmel is that they chose to invest their resources in the AVR32 series (riding on the success of the 8-bit AVR and the strong political position of the AVR group inside Atmel; IIRC the ARM group was in France while the AVR group was based in Norway), but they didn&#x27;t read the market correctly. Everyone was going away from proprietary architectures and into the Cortex ecosystem (not always rationally) - customers bought into the pseudo-standardization ARM was selling them. This standardization was only perceived, as once you get into the 32-bit domain, the code is mostly C that can easily compile between cores - its the peripheral drivers that are non-standard and where most of the porting work exists and going from an ST Cortex to an Atmel Cortex is a big headache. Anyway, this shift in the market caught Atmel (and others, like Microchip and Renesas) off guard and pushed ST into the Cortex dominance it has today.<p>Around that time, Atmel changed management and refocused the company (selling off their memory lines, other fringe products and their fabs) to be a primarily microcontroller company, but it was a bit too late and they found themselves behind. It&#x27;s been a while since I worked with 8 bit micros, but the word is that their AVR series is not really innovative anymore.<p>Seems like Atmel is back on its feet though with great new Cortex-F7 processors (I think they have the industry speed record at 300mhz and some other benefits).<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at the graphs, but $4.6bn is kind of a valuation low point considering their last 10 years or so. They probably understood that they&#x27;re too small to survive by themselves, especially as how complicated microcontrollers are becoming. I don&#x27;t think microcontrollers are such a fantastic business - talking to my friends at component distribution like Avnet and Arrow, they make a lot more money on some passive components (like power) than on micros, and for a long time some companies have been allegedly selling microcontrollers at a loss, just to get the designs.",1442905540

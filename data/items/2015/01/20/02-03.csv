8915248,comment,8912834,8914961,0,0,sedachv,,,"> My own point of view is that linear algebra is by far the most successful part of mathematics: &#x27;Most&#x27; questions you can come up with have satisfactory answers. This is in contrast to, say, number theory, where there&#x27;s a bunch of nice elementary results and a lot of interesting questions that seem nigh impossible to solve.<p>I view that as &quot;if you can find a way to express your problem in terms of linear equations, there are well-known techniques for finding solutions.&quot;",1421722746

8915235,comment,8914956,8914956,0,0,brianstorms,,,"I&#x27;ve been wondering if part of this SpaceX satellite gambit is to help Tesla Motors. Think about it: if and when there are 500,000 or a million or several million Tesla vehicles (including the Model 3) all over the world, plus thousands of SuperChargers, and they all need to be connected to the Net for messaging and value-added services, then what better way than to just have &#x27;em connect to the SpaceX service?<p>Right now Tesla Model S vehicles connect via AT&T (at least in the US, don&#x27;t know what the carriers are in other countries). It&#x27;s a tiny number of &quot;devices&quot; connected to the network so it is probably expensive for Tesla. At some point it gets really expensive. One assumes the Model 3 will have the same always-on connection that the Model S/X has. Millions of Models S/X/3 around the world mean a lot of communications costs. And then there are the SuperChargers, that will in time no doubt be communicating with cars too, to improve the user experience.<p>I suspect a few million &quot;devices&quot; connected to the SpaceX version of global wifi would be way cheaper than connecting to a dozen or two carriers in countries around the world.<p>Just a theory.",1421722539

In science you have observed phenomena, and you try to find the best (preferably simplest) theory/abstraction that will both explain them and also be able to explain phenomena that you haven&#x27;t observed yet. In software engineering, you have a set of current requirements and you try to find the best (and hopefully simplest) architecture/abstraction that will meet the current requirements but also be able to naturally accommodate requirements that you haven&#x27;t foreseen. Both science and software engineering try to devise abstractions that try to convey some &quot;higher truth&quot; than the given data, and both invariably need to be reassembled into a higher abstraction when reality doesn&#x27;t agree with them, but the test of a good scientific theory as well as a good software architecture is how long can the abstraction hold until something doesn&#x27;t fit the model.",1421721127

Use whichever language will help you to program the best.  Once you understand programming, particularly in the functional paradigm, picking up a language like Arc, or Clojure, Python, or Scala is a quick study (ok, maybe not Scala).<p>If you think Arc will help motivate you to learn to program, and has sufficient resources to teach you, then by all means go for it.  Otherwise, there are a lot of similar language that have tons of learning resources.  Racket in particular, as well as MIT Scheme, are two languages related to Arc, both with great, open-source books (<i>How to Design Programs</i> and <i>SICP</i>) that teach you how to truly program, not just hack up a web site like many programming books do [1, 2].  Really, these are probably two of the greatest programming books, albeit with very different teaching approaches.  And like Arc, both of those languages are schemes, or at least very close.<p>Finally, one additional unsolicited word of advice: don&#x27;t put off learning data structures and algorithms (particularly their time and space complexity). Both of the two books above will teach you the fundamentals of these topics.  I&#x27;m a self-taught programmer who put learning these things off for several years, saying to myself, &quot;eh, I don&#x27;t need them, what do they have to do with <i>real</i> programming?&quot;.  I confused them with the &quot;interview puzzles&quot; everyone was (rightly) criticizing.<p>Well, I was wrong, and now that I have a better grasp of the things a good CS education can give you, I&#x27;m advancing at a much quicker rate, and I understand programming at a much deeper level.  I wish I knew back when I started teaching myself that these were important things to learn.  Coursera has some excellent algorithm courses.  Khan Academy also has some very good algorithm learning materials [3].  Finally, VisuAlgo is an excellent site for visualizing algorithms [4].<p>In addition, if you ever decide to become a professional programmer, you&#x27;ll have to know algorithms and data structures for most interviews.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html</a><p>2. <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#...</a><p>3. <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algor...</a><p>4. <a href=""http://visualgo.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visualgo.net/</a>",1421721036

8915158,comment,8913572,8913572,0,0,Animats,,,"If you&#x27;ve written some Rust, and you&#x27;re more confused after reading that, it&#x27;s not your fault.<p>Here&#x27;s how to think about ownership in Rust.  First, realize that Rust has basically the same memory model as C/C++. C/C++ has three big sources of memory trouble: &quot;how big is it&quot;, &quot;who owns it&quot;, and &quot;who locks it&quot;.  C/C++ provides little help in dealing with those issue. Rust locks down all those problem. Mostly through compile time checks.<p>Ownership in Rust starts out simple. There&#x27;s single-ownership, and multiple-ownership with reference counting. The latter comes in two flavors, with and without concurrency locking. Reference counting works roughly the way you think it should.<p>In addition to ownership, there&#x27;s &quot;borrowing&quot;. This usually means creating a local reference to something. The local reference must have a scope that doesn&#x27;t outlive the thing being borrowed. That makes borrowing safe.  Borrowing is a compile-time thing with no run-time representation. Borrowed objects with reference counts don&#x27;t need reference count updates on the borrowed reference, which speeds things up a lot.  Borrowing in Rust is cheap and easy, and should be done frequently.<p>When a reference to something is passed into a function, the compiler needs to know if it&#x27;s being borrowed, or whether ownership is being handed off to the function.  The default is to borrow; for more complex situations, there&#x27;s special lifetime syntax. A similar issue appears when a function returns a reference.  Returning a reference is complicated - is it a new object, or a borrowed reference to an input object?   Creating new objects in functions and returning them should be avoided if possible. It&#x27;s a Rust idiom to create the object in the caller and pass it into a function to be modified.<p>Single ownership can be handed off to another owner.  This, after some controversy, is the default action for the &quot;=&quot; operator.  (Using &quot;<-&quot; for ownership transfer probably would have been better.)  Such a handoff invalidates the variable that gave up ownership, and that variable can&#x27;t be used again. For some types, though, you get a copy instead. For other types, you have to explicitly ask for a copy.  This part of the language is kind of ugly.<p>Rust has the concept of &quot;mutability&quot;.  This is just the inverse of &quot;const&quot;.  Since immutability is the default, you write &quot;mut&quot; in a lot of places.<p>Programs in Rust need more design effort than in some other languages.  You need to plan out who&#x27;s going to own what, and who gets to change what.  &quot;Agile&quot; types may find this troublesome. The payoff is that once the program has compiled, whole classes of errors have been eliminated.",1421720605

Less weight takes less fuel to lift which reduces the size of the craft which saves even more fuel or let's you build a stronger craft or one better suited for reentry.<p>An air breathing craft that can get to Mach 10+ would easily drop the cost of getting to space to 1/10th what it is today and let do things like have some reserve fuel in case you messed up the landing and want to come around for another pass.

Don't think of it as knowledge competing for headspace for languages and quirks but as knowledge that augments those arcane bits.<p>For your :q! example, it looks daunting but you really don't end up memorizing it verbatim like that, much like you don't memorize adding semicolons verbatim to the end of your C# lines of code or adding closing tags to markup languages, it's just part of the language, a line end implicitly requires a semicolon so you just do it, vim commands are prefixed with colons so you just do that too.<p>The q is quit, which is hardly any worse than remembering Cmd-q or Ctrl-q is quitting for OS level shortcuts and the exclamation mark means ""force"", so it's usually unnecessary unless you're trying to quit without saving your changes, or doing something the command otherwise wouldn't normally allow. The exclamation mark is used in tandem with other commands too, so you don't mentally remember "":q! is how I quit a file without saving changes"", you memorize how to build up the command you want, ""I want to issue a command, type a colon"" then ""I want to quit the editor, type a q"", then ""I want to quit without saving, so force it, type an exclamation mark"".  And if it really bothers you, you can configure vim to prompt you for an action if it would normally require a ! and you left it off.",1314021391

First of all, the Courts won't accept many more patent infringement claims than around that number. You can't go to Court and claim patent infringement for 5000 patents. Oracle tried with a few hundred and the judge forced them to drop most of them. This means they're going to find as many that are some of the most useful ones.<p>Also, Apple claimed patent infringement on 20 patents against HTC, and they only won with 2 very old ones, and I think they won a few hundred millions with them. So it's good to keep that into perspective.<p>Even if Motorola loses in Court with about 20 of them in the first round, they can try with another 20 in another lawsuit later.

Some areas are tuned to react to points, some to bars, some to grids, some to movement, some to rotation, etc. Perhaps it would be simpler to make the comparison in the other direction: ""How intricate do I have to make this visual scene to fully exercise the perceptual abilities of grating-sensitive neurons in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus of the thalamus.""

They set out with a national priority to dominate civilian aviation. But they had the wrong model. And their model was that they would inspect the hell out of their planes so that there was no metal fatigue. And their planes kept falling out of the sky. They kept saying we inspected them, but there was still metal fatigue.<p>Boeing hired a grad student who didnt know the accepted wisdom that there could be no failure. He read all the papers on the subject, found some obscure guy who said that what we have to do is make the planes more resilient so they can tolerate cracks in the metal, and based on that Boeing figured out how to use tougher material that could handle cracks. They figured out what the maximum crack length was before you had a catastrophic failure and they figured out how to have periodic reinforcements so that cracks would never get longer than thatrather than that there would be no cracks at all.<p>And in a similar way, we need to understand whats a catastrophic crack and whats tolerable. And if we can have more tolerance for failure, well have a more resilient system and a more resilient system is more adaptable, and its going to do better.""",1314020139

2912333,comment,2911859,2912010,6,0,bl,,,"True, a rod or cone cell (collectively, ""photoreceptors"") is the smallest, indivisible detector unit in the retina, but in <i>normal</i> visual processing (i.e., daylight-lit scenes), they probably never operate in isolation. The photoreceptor signals are immediately integrated by accessory cells in the retina (horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells) and the major output neurons of the retina, the ganglion cells projecting to the thalamus, exhibit ""center-surround"" sensitivity. Furthermore, any one photoreceptor can be used in many receptive fields in the downstream visual processing pathway.<p>Thus, the mapping of ""pixels"" to the number of retinal ganglion cells is probably less tenuous than a photoreceptor-to-pixel mapping. Now that I think about it, perhaps an even better definition of a physiological pixel would be a <i>functional</i> measure: the number of distinct, electro-physiologically measured center-surround fields in the thalamus. In that case, the effective megapixel rating of a human visual system is only indirectly related to the sheer numbers of photoreceptors, but more closely related to the wiring pattern. This wiring pattern is much more difficult to experimentally measure than simply counting neurons because it would involve flashing tiny, contrast-y dots of light in front of a fixated mammal while poking an electrode around in the thalamus. [This is outside of my main field, so it may have been done, but I don't know the results.]<p>Two side notes of interest:<p>1. Photoreceptors are oriented towards the rear of the retina and are embedded in a dark sheet of cells called the pigment epithelium. The upshot of this is that every photon that is involved in our visual perception has traversed a tangle of bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and their associated axons (it is easy to overlook this fact in diagrams, such as at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina</a> , because it is usually only mentioned textually in the figure caption). The fovea is relatively free of these light-scattering objects and, in addition to a higher ratio and density of cone cells, is why primate visual acuity is highest in the fovea.<p>2. In extremely low light-adapted rod cells, the absorption of single photon can trigger photo-transduction. Thus, our visual system has the capacity to operate at the very limit of physics. If I recall correctly (i.e., no citation on hand), this has even been experimentally demonstrated, although the experiment must have been pretty demanding, what with photon shot noise and all. [This last side note #2 is what I had in mind when I referred <i>normal</i> visual processing in the first paragraph. Even though you might think that this validates the photoreceptor:pixel metaphor, at best a human would probably just report a tiny inkling of a flash in some general vicinity with very poor spatial and temporal resolution.] Ah, I now see ristretto mention that.",1314018936

No one knows, though (unless theres actually been a study on this; if there has, please, correct me if Im wrong).",1314018902

2912330,comment,2906964,2910036,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"As I mentioned in my earlier post I do not think it is the power of the type system that is key but its consistency and the accompanying tools. I am not saying programming in Coq or dependent types are the answer. I am asking, what if programmers had access to a more polished toolkit to create domain specific versions of djinn where it would guide them or help layout some basics? Knowing that the code was derived from sound axioms. Other engineers can quickly protoype the validity of their ideas by mechanically running through some equations, why not software engineers?<p>Already I use types in Haskell and F# to help me figure out how to layout the code - I write some basic code where I know which function it will feed into, I don't have to think much as I try to get the code to fit the types. Nothing fancy but still highly useful.<p>As for code transformation I don't mean generic stuff like Visual Basic to Java, I mean having a team able to write the tools themselves with full awareness of the requisite semantic mappings. Or even better, creating a dsl for the domain and then having that map down to appropriate platform specific code. But it need not be traditional development you could extend it to machine learning - say you are doing genetic programming to fit data, using types to have some level of axiomatic reasoning rather than random cross over may be fruitful. There are all sorts of uses where application of basic - not fancy theory is helpful.",1314018848

Developing in such a way is clearly considered bad practice for desktop browsers (hence projects such as jquery and modernizr).<p>You could possibly justify a different sub-domain for mobile content in order to reduce bandwidth and ease development. However, you shouldn't force a redirect to one or the other any more than you would force redirection to subdomains for foreign languages. Perhaps, as with localization, use detection to suggest a subdomain and then use cookies to store a preference.<p>Even if the devices do have different capabilities, a good front-end engineer would be able to work around this with techniques such as feature detection, graceful degradation and responsive design.

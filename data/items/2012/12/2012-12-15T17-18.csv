""This kind of ends-justify-the-means interpretation of functionalism leads AI    researchers astray.

In   our investigations of the brain, and especially the neocortex, we will need to be careful in   figuring    out   which    details   are   just  superfluous     ""frozen    accidents""     of  our evolutionary past; undoubtedly, many Rube Goldbergstyle processes are mixed in 
with the important features. But as we'll soon see, there is an underlying elegance of great power, one that surpasses our best computers, waiting to be extracted 
from these neural circuits.<p>...<p>For half a century we've been bringing the  full force of our species' considerable cleverness to trying to program intelligence into computers.  In the process we've come up with word processors, databases, video games, the Internet, mobile phones, and convincing computer-animated dinosaurs. But intelligent machines still aren't anywhere in the picture. To succeed, we will need to crib heavily from
nature's engine of intelligence, the neocortex. We have to extract intelligence from within the brain. No other road will get us there.

2) How do i learn to build a website?<p>Those are two very different tasks can (and often do) require different potentially conflicting approaches.<p>If you are familiar with the skills, technologies, and requirements of a project, one starts with a discussion about the needs of a site, and go through design exercises in order to determine what it is that needs to be implemented.  That often means markups and design stuff, which will often have nothing to do with either HTML or CSS (although some people do mockup with HTML & CSS).<p>If you are trying to learn how to build a site, while also building a site, there is a process of exploration and learning that you must engage in before you know what is even possible to build.<p>This is where a modular and iterative design and build strategy has become popular.  When you don't necessarily know where you're going with your end product (because you don't know what's possible), you build small chunks of functionality, experiment with whether it meets your requirements, and then incorporate that smaller experiment into the larger whole.<p>So, what does that actually mean in concrete terms?  Building a site <i>can</i> be like building a house, where you draw up architectural plans (design mockups) and then start doing the engineering to calculate whether your house will stand up and meet your aesthetic needs.  But building a site can (and often should) look more like building a series of small experiments, and taking a step by step approach to reaching a product that meets your original concept.<p>As a very practical matter, almost everyone futzes with both their HTML and their CSS at the same time.",1355593165

4925655,comment,4925439,4925583,3,0,Ologn,,,"Except it is not bad science.  Gluten and Gliadian are opiates that are found in Triticum (wheat).  These opiates have a psychological effect on the brain.  A certain segment of the population has a severe reaction to these chemicals, and can not eat wheat.  I am surprised the article did not go more into this. There are dozens of scientific papers in mainstream journals covering this.  Yes, the article does not cite like a scientific paper, but it is popular science, not a scientific paper for specialists.  Scientific journals reflect what it says.<p>But if you want me to speculate, which I do not feel speculates very far...we know from court records that tobacco companies purposefully spiked their product with nicotine so as to cause more tobacco sales.  What chemicals have we seen a spike in from wheat from the industry in the past decades?  The chemicals with opiates.<p>On the fringes of social science, some people think wheat was a grass which was harvested originally for its opiates, not its nutritional effect.  It is not the only plant with multiple purposes - cannabis can make hemp, but also has psychological effects.  The extreme version of this theory is the agricultural revolution was started by a bunch of drug addicts trying to get their opiate fix from wheat.<p>See that is speculation.  Although speculation which could possibly have some grounding.  What is scientific and grounded is that some people have a negative reaction to gluten and gliadin.  Which this article is about. I am surprised they did not talk about how gliadin is an opiate, because there are many scientific papers on that.  You can look it up yourself.  I wrote a biology paper on this once.  I can post the references to the scientific literature if anyone is interested and does not know how to look it up themselves.",1355590849

4925652,comment,4925389,4925389,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I expect the ""best"" answer depends on what kind of page you're building. For example, is this a a stand-alone web page, one page of a one-off site, part of a CMS where templates are used for common patterns, part of a full-blown web application with lots of interaction and every page unique? Will the content be static, generated from a DB on the server, generated dynamically on the client side? Are you designing alone or collaborating with others? Do different people have different roles on the project?<p>With that said, I typically develop HTML, CSS and even JS in parallel. I try to have a fair idea of what my information architecture, content, layout, visual style and interaction design are before I start, and then treat it somewhat like a software project: start by writing a high-level outline HTML page structure and the CSS to set up the layout and basic presentation style, then add more detailed HTML and CSS for each part of the page, and iterate in increasing levels of detail until I'm somewhere near done. At any point, I might step back and refine/replace something from earlier with something more flexible or generalised, particularly with CSS as the recurring patterns for the page start to become clear.",1355590812

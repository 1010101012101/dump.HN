1277393,comment,1276882,1276882,0,0,justlearning,,,"""The longest path is the shortest and the shortest path is the longest""<p>back when i was in school and onwards in the academic world, it was always said aloud that the quicker you grasp, the intelligent you were. A lot of students(i perceive - even now) were in rush to prove that they understood - many a times getting to the end of the book before understanding the basics. The momentary appalaud of ""well said"" and ""hurray!"" turned out to be a disease - a disease of skimming thru and finding the answers. This got into an habbit and now well embedded in my approach to even outside books. 20 years (outside school) and still counting on the skimming the book[most recently, I picked up a Math book (Intro to Analysis- as suggested Brad's earlier post)]. Struggling thru is a small part of the battle; mind plays the depression game while I try to search for a notation (the greek for complement of a set), while I don't give in as I used to, nowadays it plays the second game of age-""35 years and you don't know 'xyz'!"".  So yes, my the shortest path has been so long that I have not been able to put an end to it. </end-self-humiliation><p>""avoid isolation""<p>would anyone suggest how to get by this? I work in the enterprise world, where the likes are 9-5/fix-the-bug-save-my-arse. I haven't met anyone whom I could ask about a notation or even discuss about this. I am shy to meet people (read- fearful).few people I did try to ask usually have the repulsive smirky grin. I looked for user groups in the local area (seattle-at present), but didn't find any. It would be awesome if someone tells me this proof of A-intersection-B-intersection-C is going to help in XYZ.",1271699942

And even now (after we peaked at the No. 7 paid app)""<p>It's the ""after we peaked at the No. 7 paid app"", part.  While I think it's pretty amazing that Apple managed to create it's own microindustrial economy within the App store, it seems that a leading motivation for writing Apps is just to be in the App store and get ranked.<p>Now I know full well this isn't the <i>only</i> reason people write apps for the iPhone, and maybe it's because of the walled garden effect that once you write an App you're dying to get in and hope people use it.  But personally, I like the Android ecosystem where writing and distributing software is as native as it is on any computer.<p>And based on that conjecture alone, I don't think it's an issue of 'quality control'.  Taking one giant step back, when you have a format that's easily distributed across whatever medium you choose, and don't put quality apps beside apps of less quality in a closed-off 'store', people don't even notice.  They go for the apps they want to use and they can search whatever marketplace has it, to purchase and install it.<p>Competition in the App Store is good.  Consumer choice in the market place is even better.  That's why I don't own an iPhone and never will purchase an iPad.",1271699842

So that puts a minimum size right there.<p>After that it is all a question of how many trials you were prepared to run, and how aggressively you need the answer.  I tend to push to be conservative because the product manager is guaranteed to push the other way.  For instance if you've got less than 500 trials I like to push for 99.9% confidence because, ""If the effect is really this strong, we'll get there pretty quickly.""  After that I ease off.  I've never tried to sit down and calculate any kind of optimal way to do so.<p>If I was to try to formalize it, I'd be inclined to set things up so that for some underlying bias which is smaller than what we're hoping to measure (for instance a 2% bias), our odds of picking the wrong answer are the same each time.  I don't have any analysis behind that idea, it is just something that sounds reasonable to me.

For a small theoretical basis, let's assume that people are a product of their genes and their upbringing/social context.  So, some people are genetically smarter and will grok computer science better on an inherent level.  Likewise, some people will have a parent who is a computer programmer or fall in with a nerdy friend group and that social context will get them more familiar with computer science and get them headed in that direction.<p>The problem can occur if society is telling women that they shouldn't do computer science.  Then we're missing out on people who are inherently gifted computer scientists who have been learned from their social context that they should pursue something else.  That's a problem.  When people put themselves into sub-optimal careers because of what society tells them they should be like, that's bad.<p>Think about it: what if Einstein had continued just working as a patent clerk?  Our world would be worse for it.  The inventor of the birth control pill (Gregory Goodwin Pincus) was a Jew born in Russia.  His career path would have never happened due to institutional barriers.  Heck, Sergey Brin's father saw that his family wouldn't have such advancement there and left for the US because of it - and now we have Google.<p>But what we're talking about aren't institutional barriers - in fact, I'd say most of us probably welcome women.  We would <i>like</i> more women in computer science and are hugely open to it within the computer science community.  But greater society is often telling girls (and boys) to pursue certain things from a young age.  Girls are potentially being socialized away from computer science.  That's a problem.  Even without institutional barriers, there can still be social barriers imposed by our society.<p>And, while I respect jcnnghm's position (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1276946"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1276946</a>), I have to disagree.  The fact that 57% of college graduates are female could point to a problem.  If males are being socialized against learning, that's problematic.<p>The problem is figuring out whether something is inherent or socialized.  If something is inherent, fine - life isn't fair or equal.  However, socialization matters a lot.  Many people overcome socialization.  Many others do not.  If society has organized itself in such a way that brilliant female potential computer programmers are choosing a different path because they feel it isn't for them, that's a problem.  If society has organized itself in such a way that brilliant male potential interior designers are choosing a different path, that's a problem.  And our world is socially gendered - we're encouraged to act in certain patterns based on our sex.  If society is losing out on brilliant people because they're in positions that aren't their optimal positions due to being socialized not to pursue that position, that's bad for all of us.<p><i>Just think if Marie Curie had listened to people telling her ""what girls should do"" and hadn't pursued physics and chemistry.  Then think about all the women who did and the knowledge we all lost out on.</i>",1271698845

The general attitude seems to be that you're wasting your one chance at living unless you haven't accomplished something bigger than yourself and have left a legacy. It is a rousing sentiment, but yet, at the end of the day, I can't help but be sobered by the poem Ozymandius. Yes, you've left a legacy, but only for one, maybe two, generations before that too is forgotten:<p><pre><code>  My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
  Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!
</code></pre>
Speaking of poems, poets would tell you that you've wasted your life unless you've loved; loved so deeply that you die a little when it is lost. So which is it? Legacy? Success? Love? Family?<p>In the end, I think you've nailed it with your last sentence: living your passions. If your passion is, literally, passion, then love. Make love your life. If your passion is external admiration, then succeed. (<i>Please</i> don't become a doctor or lawyer if your goal is admiration. Only do so if your passion is helping the sick or defending justice.)

Yes, when one has a very limited data set and needs to draw a conclusion in a hurry, and one has full confidence that there are no confounding variables in one's experiment, then paying very close attention to small differences in p-values can make sense.  But how often is this the case when testing a new logo or signup page?<p>I'm less mathematically sophisticated than the author, and would choose a simpler approach:  ignore weak results. If one determines that there is a 95% chance that 51% of people prefer Logo A, either stick with what what you have, go with the one you like, or keep searching for a better logo.  If you can't see the effect in the raw data without rigorous mathematical analysis, it's probably not a change worth spending much time on.<p>Instead of adjusting your significance test for each 'peek', simply ignore anything less than 99.9% 'significant'.  And while you are at it, ignore anything that's less than a 10% improvement, on the assumption that structural errors in your testing are likely to overwhelm any effects smaller than this.  Drug trials and the front page of Google aside, if the effect is so small that it flips into and out of 'significance' each time you peek, it's probably not the answer you want.",1271698297

I've <i>never</i> liked the brewed coffee in their stores -- they do a horrible job of brewing it.  Of course, most ""big tub o' coffee"" brewing methods produce at best a mediocre brew.<p>Before their espresso bean quality really took a dive, they started introducing the first generation of their automated espresso machines.  The same beans that, depending upon barista, produced a decent, sometimes very good, shot from the hand-operated espresso bars, produced an espresso approximating warm, flat cola (really) from the automated bars.  I knew one store manager of 10 plus years who would dive in and tweak the automated bar until in produced espresso that was a more palatable ""shadow"" of a good hand-pulled shot, but his motivation was personal interest and he could not keep the machine producing at that quality -- it was a constant struggle of adjustments that could not be maintained in a commercial environment.<p>I've heard it suggested that they may have started ""burning"" the beans more in an attempt to compensate for the weakness of the espresso that the automated bars pulled.  Also, my impression is that corporate attention shifted to identifying and marketing more categories of merchandise.<p>I hardly ever drink a Startbucks, any more, but I've heard that the quality has improved somewhat since Schultz dove back into operations and told people essentially to fix their quality problems.  Apparently, the beans are not being burned as badly.  They've also been rolling out a second generation of automated bar (as well as some different automated bars for locations having different volume requirements) that produces a better shot than the first generation.<p>Their in-store brewed coffee still sucks.  Their overpriced instant coffee tastes better -- as I've experienced when they first launched it and were offering side-by-side taste test comparisons.<p>P.S.  Their best ""take home"" beans/roasts, in my opinion:  Sumatra, and the holiday blends (particularly end-of-year, although Thanksgiving is, I've been told, a fairly similar blend), depending on the year.",1271698168

I was immediately reminded of a particularly misogynistic line: ""quit all your bitchin', get back in the kitchen"", so pretty anathema to the purpose of the article.<p>Back to the topic:<p>I don't think it's an issue of just lacking women in the tech industry. We lack men too. When I was going through college, computer science enrollment and matriculation were at all-time lows; it's going to take years to see the full effects of not being able to replace the first major wave of retiring programmers with enough people of high enough quality.<p>I've had non-programmer coworkers, including managers, call me names like ""nerd"" and shoot down my ideas without really listening because they assumed I was proposing something ""too technical, not practical"", and it all really came down to a lack of respect from my coworkers. How can we have people graduating with four-year degrees studying one of the most difficult human endeavors in history entering the workplace in positions that are treated barely better than burger-flipper?<p>In my mind, the issue is not just women not getting the respect and support they deserve in IT, but <i>everyone</i> not getting the respect and support they deserve. And I think the problem is largely cultural, and in part to blame on programmers themselves. The culture of programmers, especially the idealized startup culture that tries to differentiate itself from standard corporate imagery, is defined by people with the emotional maturity level of children. The pinball-machines-in-the-break-room, jeans-and-snarky-t-shirts environment is conducive to attracting geeks and only geeks. Most people in general don't want to be associated with this environment, there just happens to be slightly more men than women who fall into that minority of SciFi-and-comic-books fanatics.<p>I have struggled for years to find the level of respect for my work that I feel I deserve, rather than being ""just a code monkey."" The epiphany for me was to realize that, if I wanted to be treated like a professional, I needed to act like one. I haven't worn a printed t-shirt to work since. Some days I even wear a suit. There's nothing wrong with wearing a suit to work. I even <i>like</i> wearing a suit now, as I realized that I look much better than just jeans-and-t-shirt. Maybe it's just confirmation bias, but I definitely feel like my voice is heard more often and other, ""non-technical"" coworkers approach me more freely now.<p>Everyone wants a work environment based on mutual respect. Somehow, slightly more men are just capable of putting up with being treated like crap. This is not in any way a good thing.",1271697604

I remember that other statistical packages back then had a similar looking syntax. This is also the reason why lua/python stand no chance against R: they simply lack the vast abundance of statistical packages and tutorials. The best thing they can do is use R as an inferior process (IIRC there is a package for incanter that does that).<p>The point is though that S/R isn't that badly suited for what it was created for. There are a few pitfalls but those are explained in the langage definition.

1277271,comment,1277000,1277000,0,0,mdasen,,,"I hope someone has an answer to this.  In a lot of places (like Hong Kong or Japan), users are likely connecting to local servers a lot of the time for reasons of language or geography.  So, it's potentially easy for an ISP to offer a high speed to those local servers just like it could be easy for an ISP in Boston to offer high speed access to servers in Boston.  However, most Americans would be connecting to servers that are usually far away from them geographically.<p>My question is, are those Hong Kong users getting 1Gbps access to the internet or a small portion of the internet located within 5 miles of their position?  If I had a server in Japan, would they be able to connect at 1Gbps?  If I had a server in San Francisco?<p>I know that when I was in Israel a few months back, access to major sites like Facebook was terribly slow even over a connection that was fast when tested using Speedtest.net to a server within Israel (even accounting for latency).<p>If that's the case, would you want/accept an American ISP who offered you 100Mbps access to servers within your metro area and much slower speeds to the greater internet?  For example, in Boston we have the Northern Crossroads (<a href=""http://www.nox.org/background/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nox.org/background/index.html</a>) and my ISP could probably easily and cheaply give me very high speed access to servers within it, but that's a tiny fraction of the servers that I'd want to use since, as an English speaker, the servers I'd want to connect to are very spread out.  If they moved the bottleneck to 2 hops out, would that be helpful?  Would you accept them selling you 100Mbps or 1Gbps internet service that was actually 10Mbps to the greater internet and only that fast to servers nearby?  I'm really just musing here and am really interested in people's thoughts on the matter.<p>Hopefully someone who knows about the situation (like where ISPs costs are, whether it costs more for an ISP to get/build capacity to go across the country for me, whether it's significantly cheaper for my ISP to deliver higher speeds to a nearby server, etc.) can speak to this.",1271697397

It is difficult to mix with other groups when you cannot eat with them. Matrilineal line of descent serves the same function. Children fathered by in-group men with women outside the group are simply excluded, while in-group women face censure for the same behavior. There are structural reasons why Jewish culture has remained distinct in diaspora, while many other disjoint populations are absorbed by host populations over time.",1347101920

According to the book, when he was assigned as CEO after the merger, he wanted among other things, to replace the Paypal brand with the X.com brand. The whole company saw this as a bad idea because a lot of people knew and trusted friendly Paypal but not weird, porn-sounding X.com, but Elon apparently didn't care and just wanted ""his"" brand X.com to be the main look of the company, even after a lot of discussions and metrics showing this could end the company.<p>He ended up being replaced as CEO after a vote because of this whole debacle.<p>It's the only description of Musk that I've read in which he is painted in a negative way.

Maybe this tube could provide the support for the solar panels, stabilize the flight of the ""train""(using the shockwave to steer it?) and storage the energy as a kind of capacitor... This way you dont need an actual very expensive sealed tube with vacuum in it , just some metal plates with enough form to deflect(and mute) the waves once the ""plane"" passes...(and serve as capacitors too).<p>I am guessing all this with just one sentence so it must be way off :).<p>Thanks to spaceX and Tesla he has more knowledge now of electrical engines, electricity storage and transport, high energy aerodynamics, etc... it must be something that combines all that somehow..",1347100501

4492720,comment,4483710,4490162,2,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>This is not a serious argument. It suggests that a simple form of contract between two consenting counterparties should be made unlawful</i><p>Which happens all the time, particularly when the parties have unequal bargaining positions, in which case frankly your characterisation of the parties as ""consenting"" is a stretch at best.<p><i>and then, to get around the fact that this would result in a market where small startups would never be able to get merchant accounts</i><p>Of course they would. The industry is extremely profitable despite the ever-present risk of fraud, and the rates that merchant account providers charge to start-ups are often at least double what they can get away with for more savvy established businesses. You keep saying that start-ups wouldn't be able to get a merchant account at all if piercing agreements weren't allowed, but you've given no evidence for this and your position defies all logic. As I've argued elsewhere, piercing agreements are unlikely to provide much cover for the merchant account provider most of the time anyway, and I'm quite sure that the people in the industry have concrete figures for things like how often they really have to rely on such agreements and how much of their losses they are really able to recoup in those cases.<p><i>suggests that the entire payment processing market would either restructure itself or be forced to restructure itself to get around that problem.</i><p>In case you hadn't noticed, the on-line payments industry <i>is</i> restructuring.<p>For one thing, companies like Stripe are taking traditional merchant account/payment gateway set-ups to the cleaners. Every HN discussion on this topic is full of people who are involved with start-ups bemoaning the lack of alternatives outside the US, and as the new generation of payment companies establishes itself globally, things are only going to get better for merchant-experience-focussed companies like Stripe. The industry giants with their month-plus application processes and hundred-page legalese documents are either going to have to play nicely with the new kids (and I'm betting even a young company like Stripe is already able to negotiate much better terms than their start-up clients could) or lose out in the ever-growing on-line sales market.<p>Obviously there are already alternatives with different business models like PayPal, and despite the horror stories, they still potentially offer a much better experience to merchants than the old school providers. As offerings from other big names like Google and Amazon improve, and as more companies like Stripe go international, competition will also force PayPal to improve rather than relying on often being the only salesman in town.<p>And then there's the small issue of companies like GoCardless, who eschew the anachronisms and merchant-hostile terms of the card payment industry entirely. I expect they're going to do pretty well out of that, too.<p>In short, I think you put way too much faith in dinosaurs. The question isn't if they're going to change, it's only when. The issue for most of us running small companies outside the US right now is just that we're a bit early. I expect in five years time we'll all look back on this conversation and laugh.<p><i>The VP/Engineering in that scenario didn't even intend to create a personal attachment, and yet cases like this have been decided against people like that.</i><p>I'm not sure what your argument was in that part, but surely you know that as a basic matter of law a contract requires understanding by both parties of what the agreement is, so whatever cases you're thinking of probably weren't as simple as you're suggesting.",1347100462

4492716,comment,4491216,4492637,10,0,chipsy,,,"The 90s represented a period of growing pains where the industry was scaling its budgets and team sizes very quickly and, for the most part, didn't have any processes in place to deal with scale or to maintain a codebase for the long term - why would they, when up until that point, games usually shipped within a year or less, and the technology changed with almost every project?<p>Today the picture is still varied, but engineering practices have generally improved - for example, daily standups are popular with many studios now, there's a corpus of books and lectures about how to architect an engine or various subsystems, etc. A lot of today's commonplace material was being put into production for the first time then, and was previously only known in some other context - research, high-end graphics and simulation, etc.<p>In current AAA the bottlenecks mostly lie with the art and design teams.

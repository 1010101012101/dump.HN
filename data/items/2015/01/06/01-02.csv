For example have a population where individual sims engage in prisoner’s dilemma repeatedly with a random other sim each time (until it runs out of money). What are the results when different portions of the sim population use different strategies? Is there a way to setup the rewards/penalties in a way that encourages the best greater good even when individuals behave selfishly?<p>- complex systems, positive and negative feedback, chaos, emergence, evolution<p>- The Mathew Effect (e.g. rich get richer, poor get poorer). The general concept of vicious/virtuous cycles.<p>- the notion of the Tragedy of the Commons. And also the Tragedy of No Commons.<p>- market economics, supply and demand, the invisible hand. when does it work and when does it not. what happens when consumers have perfect knowledge, and what happens when they have different degrees of partial knowledge?<p>- Cooperation vs competition, in evolution/ecosystems, economies, politics.<p>Please let me know this overlaps with your interests!",1420509017

But instead of redefining all the UTC-offset timezones, e.g. redefining EST/EDT from UTC-5/UTC-4 to TAI-05:00:35/TAI-04:00:35, what if we redefined only UTC in terms of an offset from TAI? I think this is actually equivalent to what we have today, but it makes the relationship to TAI more obvious, and it should be easier than leap seconds for developers to understand, because they can reuse their cognitive models for time offsets.<p>So leap seconds simply gets re-branded.

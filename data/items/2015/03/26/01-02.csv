9267378,comment,9265817,9267312,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Same here. Live in a beautiful city, cool friends, lovely girlfriend. Plenty of things exist here of which I can objectively say they&#x27;re awesome, and in many things I&#x27;m genuinely interested, and so I avidly read and follow the news, whether it&#x27;s social topics, economics, politics, tech etc. Yet I hold very little interest in experiencing anything personally.<p>If I had to describe it succinctly; I&#x27;ve become a dedicated spectator, but no longer wish to participate.<p>It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous and something very strongly tells me it&#x27;s the wrong way to live life, and I&#x27;d love for that to change. But the passion just isn&#x27;t there to get involved anymore for even the simplest things like taking a walk outside. Again, as a spectator it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;m disinterested or don&#x27;t like to hear from friends if they call me or want to visit. But calling them, or visiting them, somehow it&#x27;s too big of a step.<p>As it&#x27;s only been like this for a few years I can see how ridiculous all of this is. It&#x27;s like I got the lazy syndrome: still care, but not enough to act on it. Yet it&#x27;s not really laziness as I never watch TV or sit on the couch or sleep all day or get no work done... It&#x27;s something else but I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. I wish I could take some kind of hormone injection and rediscover my lost motivation for life.<p>Similarish postscript as you btw.

Just having a simulation of you running on some box or a copy on Github might seem a bit pointless and I&#x27;m not sure many people would want it.<p>I&#x27;ve thought of a couple of possibly practical things. Firstly for the benefit of the friends and relatives remaining alive it might be nice to chat to a version of the person who&#x27;s biological body has packed up. This wouldn&#x27;t even require uploading in the manner of scanning the brain. It could just be an AI that was good at method acting and &#x27;becoming&#x27; the person in the way that a human actor can. I&#x27;d quite like an ongoing version of my gran for example who I could chat to. I guess more of a skype type chat than a robot.<p>The other thing is death is annoying for the creation of art and similar stuff. It would be cool if there was an ongoing version of Beethoven say cranking out new symphonies. Also personally it would be nice to work on intellectual stuff that exceeds what I can do in a biological lifespan. I guess if the AI seems conscious at least as in being aware of stuff and interacts normally with people who are conscious in the normal biological way that&#x27;s probably enough - it doesn&#x27;t really matter what the philosophers think of it.",1427334772

9267347,comment,9264531,9264899,0,0,sredna,,,"Can&#x27;t agree more.<p>When a new language is created, its feature set is a product of the times it is created in. i.e. what features are considered useful, popular, best practice etc.\nOf course times change and with it what this set of desirable features is. Languages evolve by adding support for some of these new features. \nBut adding these new features whilst preserving the old becomes increasingly difficult and the new features tend to be somewhat hobbled and don&#x27;t fit that well with the older features. \nFor the first 10 years or so this tends to be ok but when languages get to the 10 - 20 year mark they start looking increasingly like frankensteins monster - a mixture of parts from different places / eras, none of which work terribly well and which don&#x27;t fit that well with others.\nAt some point IMO it&#x27;s worth jumping to a new language despite the smaller community and package availability. But it&#x27;s often only when you do try it for a while when you realise how much better the dev experience is compared to the frankenstein languages which have on paper adopted similar features.\nTo me this is where Java, JavaScript, Python etc are now. On paper they can claim many of the features now that Dart has but the experience using them is not that of using those features in Dart. ﻿<p>I can&#x27;t imagine there are many decent developers who if they really give dart a proper go, wouldn&#x27;t much prefer to work with it than JavaScript.",1427334721

9267341,comment,9260286,9264805,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I think we have answered, to the extent it is possible to answer, the question of whether there is an afterlife. And the related question of whether our minds are independent of our bodies.</i><p>I don&#x27;t agree, if by &quot;minds&quot; we mean qualia itself. Of course, personality and memories and much of our experience lives in our brain. Most of what we call &quot;mind&quot; lives in the brain, and no one disputes this.<p>The question, to this point unanswered, surrounds whether anything&#x27;s left over when the brain is gone. I tend to doubt that a brain-less qualia would carry much in the way of memory; it might be completely memory-less, acted upon by karma but unaware of any prior lives. A minute after I die, I don&#x27;t expect to remember who &quot;Michael O. Church&quot; was, just as I don&#x27;t remember previous lives in this one, although the karma accrued in this life will affect me.<p>Qualia is also impossible to measure except subjectively (and, of course, once the brain is gone, that person is not coming back to report). We can measure brain activity which is, under normal circumstances, highly correlated to subjective experience; we can&#x27;t measure experience itself.<p>Fifty years ago, people thought that a person&#x27;s thinking would cease under sensory deprivation. However, we find that people in floatation tanks actually have <i>more</i> cognitive activity. It seems that the increased freedom allows for a more intense and powerful experience. As for the NDE, this is likewise a time when we&#x27;d expect the person&#x27;s consciousness to be dimming, but it seems to do the opposite. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t prove anything about what happens when a person is actually dead, because... well, you can&#x27;t interview them. Maybe the heightening of subjective experience continues after the brain shuts down, maybe subjective experience just ends. We can&#x27;t ask them.<p><i>So yes, I think we can be as sure as we need to be that NDEs are functions of brain activity, not of our consciousness somehow being liberated from the confines of the neurones that run it and journeying to the afterlife, only to be returned to its neuronal matrix again.</i><p>To make it clear, I don&#x27;t necessarily think that NDEs are a pure, reliable afterlife experience. There&#x27;s something we&#x27;d have to confront if they were: reports contradict. People&#x27;ve come back from NDEs with predictions like that Japan would fall into the ocean in 1997; that clearly didn&#x27;t happen. If we took every report of subjective spiritual experience literally, we&#x27;d be in a lot of trouble, because people come back from such experiences with some <i>weird</i> ideas.<p>I tend to think that there&#x27;s something in the NDE, but a reliable afterlife experience that can be taken at face-value seems unlikely. I tend toward the Tibetan Buddhist interpretation, which is that it&#x27;s still a subjective experience as the mind enters another bardo.<p>Of course, it will never constitute a case for &quot;life after death&quot; because the people having such experiences never died. Even many people who believe in an afterlife don&#x27;t believe in NDEs as reliably true afterlife experiences for numerous reasons.<p><i>I can&#x27;t imagine what more evidence we could need, unless you&#x27;re suggesting that, until we understand everything about mental processes, we should act as if we understand nothing about them.</i><p>That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m suggesting at all.

9267335,comment,9266725,9266725,0,0,ryanjshaw,,,"This topic seems to come up regularly, but I feel the discussions I see here are far too heavy to digest for the people who would benefit most from understanding the issues being presented (OP post is > 1,300 words).<p>I believe what it really comes down to is that people new to distributed processing think they want &quot;exactly once delivery&quot;, but later they (hopefully) learn they really want &quot;exactly once processing&quot;. For example:<p>> We send him a series of text messages with turn-by-turn directions, but one of the messages is delivered twice! Our friend isn’t too happy when he finds himself in the bad part of town.<p>This is easily resolved by amending each message with an ordinal indicator, e.g. &quot;1. Head towards the McD&quot;, &quot;2. Turn left at the traffic lights&quot;, etc. The receiver then dedupes and the instructions follow &quot;exactly once processing&quot;. Processing messages exactly once is a &quot;business rule&quot; and the responsibility for doing so lies in the business logic of the application.<p>This example also brings up another typical point of confusion in building distributed systems: people actually want &quot;ordered processing&quot;, not &quot;ordered delivery&quot;. The physical receiving order does not matter: your friend will not attempt to follow instruction #2 without first following instruction #1. If instruction #2 is received first, your friend will wait for instruction #1.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that the desired processing order of the messages has nothing to do with the physical sending order: I could be receiving directions to two different places from two different people, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what order they are sent or received, just that all the messages get to me! A great article covering these topics in more detail with other real world examples is &quot;Nobody Needs Reliable Messaging&quot; [1].<p>I think it is useful to try understand why new distributed system builders run into these difficulties. I suspect they try to apply local procedure call semantics to distributed processing (a fool&#x27;s errand), and message queue middleware works well enough that a naive &quot;fire and forget&quot; approach is the first strategy they attempt. When they subsequently lose their first message (hopefully before going into production), it&#x27;s natural to think in terms of patching (e.g. distributed transactions, confirmation protocols, etc.) rather than to consider if the overall design pattern is appropriate.<p>Oddly, there is at least one very well designed solution that addresses these challenges - the Data Distribution Service (DDS) [2] - but I almost never see or hear about it at any of my clients.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/no-reliable-messaging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/no-reliable-messaging</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://portals.omg.org/dds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portals.omg.org/dds/</a>",1427334527

(In my case, those are memory safety in parallel mode, GC freedom, data race freedom, fast interop with C code, and zero-overhead generics.) The languages have wildly different designs. So saying &quot;Go is going to beat Rust&quot; like the OP did is pointless cheerleading, and the &quot;apples to oranges&quot; comment is correct to point that out.<p>A useful thought experiment is: If Rust completely failed to garner any mindshare, could I switch to Go for the project I work on (Servo)? The answer is no: Go&#x27;s design goals are totally incompatible with the project. C++ would be more appropriate than Go (though it would mean sacrificing many of Rust&#x27;s advantages, of course). That&#x27;s why I, and the Rust community as a whole, tend to dislike the comparison. Go is a fantastic language that works really well for lots of use cases, but a C++ replacement for all niches needs a lot of things that Go doesn&#x27;t have.

At the moment, it feels like XMPP is the only open chat solution, which no-one can touch since Pidgin, Adium & Gajim are all broken (I&#x27;m still thankful for this tools!).<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2069810"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2069810</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://about.psyc.eu/Jabber#Technical_Issues_in_Jabber"" rel=""nofollow"">http://about.psyc.eu/Jabber#Technical_Issues_in_Jabber</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://wiki.tox.im/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.tox.im/Main_Page</a>",1427332706

9267218,comment,9263934,9266954,0,0,jmccree,,,"Verizon (and ATT, and CenturyLink) are Tier 1 transit networks for peering operations. If Level3s peering traffic ratio are off balanced by netflix&#x27;s traffic, I see no reason why Verizon shouldn&#x27;t do the exact thing Level3 did to Cogent back in the day. Also, keep in mind Netflix is using Level3&#x27;s CDN service, so you have a scenario on the flipside where Level3 has become a transit network and ContentProvider also.<p>The issue is really that the idea of transit providers in general are becoming obsolete. So much fiber was laid, with DWDM and further subdivision abilities, it costs comparatively nothing to get a nationwide network these days. That was Cogent&#x27;s entire business model, buy cheap fiber, sell transit for almost nothing to content providers, practically (in some cases, actually) give away transit to ISPs/businesses to keep their traffic ratios as balanced as possible.<p>Now, we&#x27;re in a situation where it&#x27;s not technically or financially hard to have a presence in every regional peering point. The major content providers don&#x27;t need transit providers (or in the case of Level3&#x27;s CDN, are already provider) except out of convenience and their access to settlement free peering. The major ISPs have no need for transit providers(or are already providers), as all the content providers wants to peer with them, and most of them have nationwide networks to do so. (see comcast: <a href=""http://business.comcast.com/images/default-source/about-us/the_comcast_network.jpg?sfvrsn=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.comcast.com/images/default-source/about-us/t...</a> )<p>Unregulated peering has lead to the cost of transit plummeting to almost nothing. ( <a href=""http://drpeering.net/white-papers/Internet-Transit-Pricing-Historical-And-Projected.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drpeering.net/white-papers/Internet-Transit-Pricing-H...</a> ) We&#x27;ve just hit an interesting point where 2 contentproviders (Netflix and Youtube) are half of all internet traffic, and the eyeball networks are all basically tier 1 transit providers. There&#x27;s basically unlimited choice for transit providers for ContentProviders, but each eyeball only has 1-3 ISPs to choose from.<p>My thoughts are rather than attempting to regulate transit/peering, regulate that last mile network and let people choose their own transit provider. Back in the DSL days, I used a local ISP that provided cheaper/better service than our telco. If I could pay a flat $x/mo for 1gb connection to a transit provider of my choice, I&#x27;m sure Google or Level3 would offer cheap uncongested access.",1427332543

In other words []int and [5]int behave entirely differently)<p>3) go has overloaded functions : <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/</a>, they&#x27;re just not accessible to you<p>4) go has exceptions (panic/recover), negating all the advantages of Go error checking, and providing zero fixes for the problems it introduces (finding the source line where an error happened and if/how multiple errors are related. Easy in Java/C++/..., hard in Go) (in C++ you have to be aware of whether any external code you use throws exceptions ... in Go you have to be aware if any external code you use panics. And if you say I haven&#x27;t dealt with it, that means that you quite literally haven&#x27;t dealt with it. Same as in C++. External libraries throwing exceptions is perfectly fine ... as long as they never actually throw an exception. Panicing standard library is fine ... as long as it doesn&#x27;t panic ... If you&#x27;re looking for correct code, it is of course not fine)<p>5) Go&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot; threading and panics. Try crashing a Go program with shared data with a null-pointer derefence in the shared data. Someone please explain to me how the resulting output is simple.<p>6) golang&#x27;s own compiler and standard library are not in fact idiomatic Go. This goes from small problems (like total lack of unit tests in quite a few places), to larger ones, like not using interfaces for logging.<p>7) interface{}. I just grepped a reasonable, thoroughly reviewed codebase I&#x27;ve written, of several tens of thousands lines of Go. Result: 2.7 uses of interface{} per 1000 lines of code.<p>Is this what people here call simple to think about code ? I would argue that you don&#x27;t understand a codebase until you&#x27;ve read it. That&#x27;s a certainty. So can we at least agree there&#x27;s a point where verbosity no longer increases readability ? I hope you can see Go is far past that point.<p>Go&#x27;s type system : riddled with exceptional behaviour. Literally it says &quot;type system applies unless it&#x27;s doing <-, cap, len, copy, new, append or delete calls&quot;, in which case we do something custom. The resulting behaviour, of course, is inconsistent with Go&#x27;s type system (which is really the point of the code of course, unfortunately, there&#x27;s surprises buried in there, and those calls are inconsistent with eachother as well).<p>All of these are implemented as exceptions in the compiler. I would warn you about this link : once it is seen, it cannot be unseen :<p><a href=""https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/internal/gc/typecheck.go#L241"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/internal/gc...</a><p>The irritating part is that this sums up Go mailinglist behaviour quite well. Coding practices is for you, not for us, the Go authors. Generics ? Of course we need that, but you obviously don&#x27;t as you&#x27;re a bad programmer. And if you&#x27;re asking for something else that must mean you suck. Overloading ? Ditto. Generic types ? Yes for us, not for you though !<p>Of course, all of these claims are thrown around and when you actually read the compiler code you wonder ... do these guys know about type systems ? Don&#x27;t these guys know about the standard coloring algorithm ? Why aren&#x27;t they using extremely-well-known algorithm X for this ?<p>In other words, it really looks like the compiler was (and is) written by someone who last opened a compiler book in the 70s. But reading the mailinglist, you&#x27;d think they were the central authority on compiler theory and you&#x27;re stupid. This is in fact not the case.<p>Go works and feels like a late-90s language like Oberon. Clean at the surface, with lots of buried ugliness. Lots of weird custom datatypes, forms and parts of the standard library that are not implemented in the language itself. It&#x27;s why I switched to C/C++. Go is simply the same as those old languages we moved away from. There is nothing in Go that cannot be achieved better and more flexible in C++, D and Rust.",1427332437

People are focusing much about generics/templates but it&#x27;s not that Go completely lack any way of creating modular and reusable code.<p>- pointer/value distinction but having safe pointers by disallowing pointer arithmetics and instead providing runtime bound checking (slices)<p>- garbage collection (this topic actually opens a can of worms of it&#x27;s own, regarding the placement of the language on the spectrum)<p>If you take C and add those features (instead of starting from another language and removing the features, see Blub Paradox) it&#x27;s more apparent that it adds some value.<p>One could argue that the comparison with C misses the point, given that one of the main reasons C is still alive and kicking is because of it&#x27;s ubiquity and the fact that its calling convention is the de facto standard of modern operating systems, all of which is defeated by introducing a new language (with a non-C calling convention!) that doesn&#x27;t even aim at the level of control (especially over memory allocation) that C gives.<p>However that&#x27;s where Go&#x27;s cultural roots are. Well, except for the concurrency parts and other bits that were inspired from other languages, but when talking about sorting or reducing arrays, that part stems from the C culture.<p>I have the feeling that one of the reasons Go is so successful, is that there are many people who would actually like C but recognise what a giant time sink can be to become proficient and write good quality software in it.",1427332114

Do you think it sensible that the universe provide you with the <i>ability</i> to make causal loops and then somehow <i>forbids</i> you from actually making them, even though once you've been given the ability, they are very easy to generate?<p>Additionally, if the universe is going to keep stepping in your way of what it has given you the ability to do, there's no reason for it to forbid you from making causal loops. All it has to do is forbid you from generating a paradox via such a loop.<p>I.e., you can have a self-consistent universe that has unlimited FTL and unlimited time travel as long as everyone plays nice. In fact, you can have unlimited time travel even is everybody is trying to kill their grandfather.

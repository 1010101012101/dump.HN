You can get a lot of what it <i>isn't</i>, but nailing down what it <i>is</i> is quite a challenge. Even the ""what is the difference between objects and concepts"" page is very vague: <a href=""http://xlr.sourceforge.net/concept/objects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xlr.sourceforge.net/concept/objects.html</a><p>It seems to be a Haskell typeclass, or a Java interface. Arguably this entire language is a reaction to the fallacious belief than an object <i>must</i> be a concrete noun and all methods <i>must</i> be concrete verbs. Contra to repeated assertions to the contrary, there are <i>numerous</i> Object-Oriented languages that can express the exact same solution to the ""max"" problem that the site tends to go on and on about: <a href=""http://xlr.sourceforge.net/examples/maximum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xlr.sourceforge.net/examples/maximum.html</a> , with varying levels of precision on the mapping. But I actually am having a hard time coming up with any current language that is actually incapable of expressing the putatively-hard generic ""max"" function, and a number of them are pretty much as clean as XLR.<p>If I am wrong about what a concept is, I'd suggest the correct solution is a page somewhere early in the sequence that lays out exactly what a concept is. No handwaving. Not something at the level of ""An object is some data with associated methods"", but a literal discussion of what a ""concept"" is with actual syntax, preferably running code. If that is there, I couldn't find it in ~10 minutes clicking around looking for it.",1277758793

1469411,comment,1466906,1467464,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Exactly. I think there's a lot of astroturf/fake reviews on Amazon for example.<p>It's soooooooo easy to create fake/throwaway identities on the Internet I think you often have to be very very skeptical about the value of any gushingly positive or gushingly negative ""reviews"" of a commercial product or service written by a stranger, especially if it's a sort of mainstream category like books or music albums where there might me a traditional PR/advertising company involved that's now doing ""social media"" promotion. Giveaways: same writing tone/voice/pov used in each review; use of industry-specific insider/professional lingo that the average Joe wouldn't know; reviews that are just <i>too</i> complete/thorough, etc.<p>Which then leads back to what I think is going to be a service category in increasing demand in the future (and thus an opportunity for more startups): trusted curators and aggregators. Entities that don't just include everything. Entities that discriminate with an eye for quality, and try hard to be independent from vendor influence. For example, for me it once got to the point where the only movie reviewer I would trust was Roger Ebert. With other reviewers I couldn't tell if they were paid shills, or they were naive/ignorant, or too much a slave to their own personal genre tastes, or they just weren't going about doing the review in an intelligent and balanced manner. Ebert I could generally trust. I want a web-based Roger Ebert for doctors, for auto repair shops, for schools. Seems like there are some guys doing quite well doing it for wines, for example.<p>This is actually one area where I think crowdsourcing is horrible, by the way. Crowdsourcing when applied to reviews is almost the total opposite of trusted curation. What if the crowd in question is full of fools or paid shills? Garbage in, garbage out.

IE 5.5 was such a tremendous step forward in reliability and consistency that web apps stampeded towards it and away from the alternative, the hideous Netscape 4.72.  Before anybody could plan for it, tens of billions of dollars of activity had moved to IE, and Netscape's market capitalization was a smoking crater.<p>The catch was that the web apps of that time were brittle, something like Perl or PHP code with HTML snippets hard-coded into it.  The brittleness of these apps prematurely standardized the quirks of IE 5.5/6.  Microsoft had no choice but to put the product line on long-term support.  Consequently, a lot of app authors sensibly decided to target IE 6's carved-in-stone quirks rather than emerging standards.  At that point IE 6 was there to stay for the long haul; trying to migrate away would have been tilting at windmills.<p>What we are seeing today is that (1) the emerging standards of 1998 have finally been carved into stone, (2) the web app frameworks have <i>finally</i> gotten good enough at separating logic from presentation to make rewrites worthwhile, and (3) IE challengers finally accumulated enough development to compete.  This is not because Microsoft was evil, but because you have to climb a tall hill to replace a pretty good solution with an ideal solution.",1277758119

1469402,comment,1466391,1468716,0,0,roel_v,,,"You're bringing this as if there is an objective measure for the 'needs' of the living space of two people, and that what is considered 'normal' is way above that objective measure. You're not bringing any supportive evidence for this (in my eyes) grandiose claim, other than proof by vigorous hand waving and stating it in terms of great certainty.<p>The one objective measure one can bring to the table is the lower boundary - which is maybe around 2 m2 per person, as there are numerous houses (e.g. dwelling where illegal immigrants are housed in by human traffickers) (I'm just making a guess here, based on hearing for example about 50 people being packed in small houses in farming areas). I suppose you're not seriously arguing that this is what we should strive for, yet this is (objectively) how little room humans can 'survive' on. (if it were possible on less, these people would get less, considering human traffickers probably try to minimize their costs in order to maximize profits).<p>You quantify your statements by saying that 30m2 is 'livable' for two people. I don't see how you can make this assertion. What is 'livable' or 'comfortable' is entirely subjective. One may get /used/ to living in a smaller room; heck, one would get 'used' to being sodomized daily with a coke bottle too, I guess, as long as it's done for a long enough time. That still doesn't mean it's something to aim for. You're projecting an entirely subjective /opinion/ (houses should be small, people should not have much stuff which is implied by living in such a small house, ...) onto this discussion and present it as /fact/.<p>Anyway I'm perfectly willing to accept that there is an 'optimum' in the sense that the median of the population would feel comfortable enough living in an apartment of a certain size. I know of no way to measure this optimum, because so many of the variable are hard to quantify. Instead we could say that the reality shows preferences already: the amount of space people feel most comfortable in, in function of their spending capability, is the house they live in! This may not be perfect, but it sure would show that what 'people' in general find 'comfortable enough' is a lot higher than your 30 m2.",1277757879

This line in the article ""They also need to start to think more seriously about how Oracle can contribute to Sun's open source products, and not just the other way around."" needs substantiation. If I were Larry Ellison, I see no reason to do that right now. Especially when Sun's contributions to open source didn't do them (Sun) a world of good in pure financial terms.<p>The other interesting statement is this one ""The problem is that Oracle is naturally trying to optimise its acquisition of Sun for its own shareholders, but seems to have forgotten that there are other stakeholders too"". As a public company, Oracle has a fiduciary obligation to protect its shareholders interests. It has no such obligation towards the open source world at large.",1277757619

Being the business guy, I hired a developer (employee level not co-founder) to write a software program for me.  I ran into some of the same issues as Vignesh like lack of motivation from my developer.  He had taken the time to educate me about how difficult it might be to estimate how long it would take to get the software built and so I understood that it wouldn't be reasonable to judge performance based solely on results.  I also didn't care what time of day he worked.  However, where we ran into issues was that he was never motivated enough to put in at least 20 hours per week like he originally agreed to.  Instead he would give me a maximum of 10 hours in a week and often only 5.  It was very frustrating because I was expecting on him to at least meet this standard, one which he had control over.  That frustration came across to him at times and only made his motivation level even worse.  The relationship only got worse and worse over time and we finally ended up parting ways.<p>The one thing that I am very grateful for is that before I got too far with working with him, we had a written agreement signed and in place that stipulated what would happen in case of certain eventualities.  This made parting ways a lot less messy than it could have been.<p>One other lesson that I learned is that it's critical to understand what motivates the other person.  If you can't understand his motivations and what's important to him, then you shouldn't be working with him.  It's a big, big problem to have a co-founder or a key employee who lacks intrinsic motivation to get stuff done.<p>As a related question to the HN crowd, how many hours per week is it reasonable to expect a developer to work?  Is 20 hours per week too much?",1277757562

Pages: 1-37  
Year of Publication: 2007
ISSN:0219-1377<p>This paper presents the top 10 data mining algorithms identified by the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) in December 2006: C4.5, k-Means, SVM, Apriori, EM, PageRank, AdaBoost, kNN, Naive Bayes, and CART. These top 10 algorithms are among the most influential data mining algorithms in the research community. With each algorithm, we provide a description of the algorithm, discuss the impact of the algorithm, and review current and further research on the algorithm. These 10 algorithms cover classification, clustering, statistical learning, association analysis, and link mining, which are all among the most important topics in data mining research and development.",1277756943

Yes they interact in the sense that it takes two (or more) parties to trade or make contracts, what I mean is that they act for themselves and not coordinate on a mass scale to make the resulting system in a certain direction. Agents exhibit behavior that consists of simple profit-seeking rules, which in turn generates a system dynamic on the macro scale.

1469302,comment,1460663,1467208,0,0,elblanco,,,"I appreciate the response, but the impression at your customer's sites is that they are dealing with sales and marketing people. If somebody's job is majority spent on sales and marketing efforts, he's a saleman or a marketer even if he doesn't have a sales and marketing degree (degrees count for very little in the vast majority of sales and marketing positions in my experience). I actually have received business cards from people in Palantir who's titles (at least on the cards <i>and</i> in their resumes) are ""Business Development"" or something similar. Not ""Engineer"" with a bullet buried someplace on their responsibilities as an “account manager to XYZ agency”.<p>We've all filled many hats, I even take the trash out, or change the toner in the printer from time to time at my place, but that doesn't make me a trash man or the ""toner guy"", I understand what you are saying. But really, sometimes when a person's job is something other than their title or their degree would indicate, that's their job. Sorry, but if you spend 80% of your time engineering, you're an engineer. Likewise, if you spend 80% of your time selling you're a salesman. It doesn’t matter if your degree is “Ethnomusicology” and your title says “Forward Deployed Engineer”.<p>I know of a couple people there that have transitioned in the last year or so into full-time sales roles but started as engineers. That's not to say that they won't transition back to engineering later on. But for the time being, they are ""salesmen"". If you split your time more evenly, and it sounds like you personally do, perhaps you just fill several roles? I bet you have at least one person on staff who spends 3/4 of his/her time recruiting. But that's unlike some of your colleagues who, while they may do more than one thing (which not unusual at any organization no matter how large or small), spend most of their time doing sales and marketing. In fact I've just had people in two organizations who are deployed in theater right now relay to me how they purchased your solution after meeting with teams of sales people over the last few months.<p>There's no doubt that you guys are building some very good technology (deployment issues notwithstanding). But that technology has to stand for itself if what you and Karp are saying is to have any credibility. And I know that carpet bombing D.C. with advertisements, business development associates and sales people is not accurately reflecting your statements no matter how it’s spun. In fact, by making a big deal out of ""not having a sales or marketing department"", isn't that yet just another form of advertisement?<p>Statements like, ""I can categorically confirm that this is not BS: we don't have sales people, we don't have marketing people.  This doesn't mean that we don't have people performing those functions -- of course we do!  However, the people performing those functions are all technical folk who have stepped into the breach to do the needed work to grow our business."" are just splitting hairs and come off as untrue when interfacing with the sales, BD and marketing staff of your company. I’m sorry, but I and many people in the IC are immune to these types of Jedi mind tricks – and I’m giving you an honest assessment of what we all talk about in reference to your company. Please take this as constructive criticism. Efforts to not have a sales and marketing department, purely to obfuscate the presence of sales and marketing staff, and then pump up the lack of sales and marketing people, does not help the credibility of these kinds of statements.<p>I think something like, ""what was meant was that we don't have people who know nothing about the product, worrying about their commission and their quota and adding essentially zero value to the process. "" is fundamentally stronger to your message. ""Our sales and marketing staff are also all engineers on our products"" is much closer to the truth than what was presented in the Tech Crunch article and here. If <i>that</i> was the message that was getting out across the IC, I think that your company’s credibility would be much stronger. But right now it’s seen as precisely the opposite.
Here’s an exact quote from an analyst downrange I work with from time to time in reference to issues they’ve been having with their Palantir deployment, “they ultimately fell for a slick talking salesman that showed how well Palantir handles canned data. They got EXACTLY what they paid for.” Another from PM I work with from time to time, “do you know of anybody who’s happy with the Palantir install?” I’m not sharing these to knock your product, but to help provide you with some insight into where the minds of your customers are. And by customers, I don’t mean the acquisition folks and deputy directors who sign off on the purchase, I’m talking about the people who you are trying to help, the end analysts.<p>I know that in general, the people I’ve met from your company are extremely bullish on how you guys are doing, and that’s great. Their enthusiasm for what they are doing is commendable. But what I, and my colleagues in the community are not seeing is a steady, reserved hand of reality coming in and helping you guys turn the reality distortion field from 11 to a nice, listenable 5. Obviously you guys have to trumpet your product and make it look as good as possible, I get that. But don’t be deaf to the cries of your customers! One thing that I definitely came away with from working with a few of your deployed engineers is that they definitely want to do what they can to help the customer. But that implies not just listening to how you can be better, but also where you are falling down.<p>> ""I've even I've stepped up into that role: along with writing our backend data importer and authoring our XML formats and processing pipelines, I also run our college recruiting program, and write for and edit our tech blog .  Does that make me a recruiter or a blogger?  ""<p>Yes. It does. Depending on context or time spent on those activities. To give you an example at my own company, I'm an engineer, an application manager, a product manager, a salesman, business development, trainer, analyst, and half a dozen other hats. If I'm in doing a sales pitch, you can guess sure as the sky is blue that I'm a ""saleman"" for that context, I'm not an NLP algorithm specialist, or an Operations Manager, or a ""toner guy"". But it's certainly extremely helpful that I know those roles so I can answer those questions in the pitch if they come up. My education is in Computer Science, Mathematics and Management, it doesn’t really matter though if for that day, the job I’m doing is “Analyst”. Two years ago, I spent 80% of my time in sales, I was a “salesman”. I’ve now starting moving much of that work off of my plate and maybe only spend 40% of my time doing that. But to say that we’ve never had a “salesman” would be fallacious.",1277756220

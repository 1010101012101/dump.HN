Worse, your example actually supports my side&#x27;s position: they cracked the best crypto they had the second they knew how it worked and no methods were in place to reliably detect this. Today, they crack the complex systems and protocols people are using shortly after figuring out how they work as quality is so bad and everyone uses same ones. The modern example of enigma would be people using Linux desktops instead of Windows, Foxit instead of Adobe, unusual-but-good web servers instead of Apache, and so on to hope attackers not knowing will keep them safe. And it usually works, too, unless it&#x27;s a targeted attack by pro&#x27;s. That&#x27;s saying something. ;)<p>My method combines vetted mechanisms with ways that adhere to their guidelines for secure usage, is directed by tools designed by security pro&#x27;s, largely invisible to users, require a hack on system to find, and force custom, difficult attacks. One can mathematically prove that my strategies possess the traits I claim along with immunity from some issues and vastly improved probabilistic security against most others. So, all the evidence is on our side in theory and the field results where compromise is rare for us even in face of pro&#x27;s whose bonuses require it.<p>Feel free to refute this by showing me how everyone using two browsers, OpenSSL, or a desktop OS (Windows) with no changes on the same platform kept them safe from major attacks.

Which is that you&#x27;re selecting for one thing and judging whether or not you were biased based on another.<p>> Now suppose that we select without bias or inaccuracy all the applicants that have an 80% or better chance of graduation.<p>This is subtly different than selecting for the highest graduation rate possible because it&#x27;s binary, you want a group with >80% chances not a group with the best chances. Imagine if instead of the distributions you had group A was composed of people with a 100% chance of graduation and B was composed of people with an 80% chance of graduation. Our process does nothing to distinguish between those people because that extra 20% chance of graduation doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>This brings me to what I think is the fundamental problem with your criticism, it&#x27;s not clear to me what it means for a group in your example to over perform. If you select a group with the goal of 80% of them graduating it doesn&#x27;t make sense to call 90% of them graduating an over performance.

10484913,comment,10481316,10482279,0,0,mvclark,,,"Thanks for this great question.  To answer it, a good place to start is with <i>why</i> we wanted to build Blabr.<p>Some months ago, we were working with interactive spreadsheets from the Space Math @ NASA website: <a href=""http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/ILabs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/ILabs.html</a>.  These are all Excel spreadsheets, with interactive &#x27;sliders&#x27; that let students experiment with a variety of mathematical models for planetary structure, heat flow and rotation among other modeled properties.<p>The author of the spreadsheets (Dr Sten Odenwald, NASA) wanted to create online versions of these modules.  He wanted a way for students to easily access and interact with the modules directly in a browser, on a range of devices used in today&#x27;s classrooms (e.g., Chromebook, iPad).  Using Google Docs (Sheets) was a possibility, but it didn&#x27;t have support for the kind of sliders and plots that the modules required.<p>But there was a more fundamental issue with spreadsheets: it&#x27;s hard to understand the math.  Mathematical formulas are cryptic because they (usually) use cell references, and are buried behind the results in cells.  Consider, for example, the Excel file for the module &quot;Basic Properties of Mars as a Planetary Body&quot; (ILab11marsmodel.xlsx on the ILabs page above).  It includes this formula for modeled center distance:<p><pre><code>  =($J$5+$J$8*COS(6.242*(B8+16)/$J$11))\n</code></pre>\nIt isn&#x27;t straightforward to understand the math behind that computation.  And for the Space Math educational spreadsheets, math is a key part of the learning.<p>Something like this would be clearer:<p><pre><code>  m = r + a*cos(6.242*(t+16)/p)\n</code></pre>\nwhere<p><pre><code>  r = slider &quot;radius&quot;\n  a = slider &quot;amplitude&quot;\n  p = slider &quot;orbital-period&quot;\n</code></pre>\nand t is a specified time vector (array).<p>Note also that m is a vector dependent on the time vector t.  In the Excel spreadsheet, this is accomplished by:<p>1. specifying t values (17 of them) in column B.<p>2. specifying the formula in a cell of another column.<p>3. copying the formula (16 times) in the new column.<p>But how does the student know that the formula is the same for each row?  That&#x27;s very tedious to do by inspection.  Typically, you look at the copied formulas and--based on a quick perusal of formulas and cell references--you <i>assume</i> that they are all the same formula.  But this can be dangerous.  We found that sometimes the formulas <i>do</i> differ as you move down a column.  But what&#x27;s worse, sometimes that&#x27;s what the spreadsheet author intended, and other times it&#x27;s a bug!  For example, the spreadsheet author might have edited a formula and forgotten to copy it over all cells in a column.<p>We felt that there&#x27;s got to be a better way for these kinds of science/engineering/math spreadsheets.  And that was the focus of the Blabr design.  For the Mars spreadsheet, here&#x27;s the blab equivalent we came up with: <a href=""http://blabr.io/?3df6e2368e89a8c3f780"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blabr.io/?3df6e2368e89a8c3f780</a>.  (More examples: <a href=""http://spacemath.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spacemath.github.io</a>)  The math is much easier to follow than it is in the Excel spreadsheet.  Moreover, a vector formula is specified in one place, rather than copied across a column of cells.<p>In summary, we&#x27;d say that the following are reasonable criteria for using Blabr, rather than using a spreadsheet:<p>1. You want to create an online, interactive computational worksheet (web page) with sliders, tables, and plots.<p>2. A key focus of the worksheet is the math itself.  You want the math to be easy to follow, and to edit.<p>These are typical criteria for a range of scientific computing applications (especially for education and mathematical modeling), which is why we&#x27;re focusing Blabr (for now) on the notion of &quot;scientific computing for the web&quot;.<p>Clearly there will be many use cases where a spreadsheet is more suitable than a blab.  We&#x27;ll give that part of the question more thought, and reply soon.",1446338491

The advice to all standardize on a few things that get the most attention by attackers resulted in botnets of hundreds of thousands to millions of nodes that required just a few 0-days & pre-made expliot kits with high reliability. My methods blocked all of that in the field despite tons of recorded attempts and even pentesting by pro&#x27;s. Everyone else doing it had same results. QED. So, are you all continuing to offer the same bad advice because you&#x27;re amateurs at real security or just involved in defrauding your customers for profitable consulting fees?<p>So, let me break it down again in concrete, proven terms suppored by decades of INFOSEC research and field work. History shows any complex system has vulnerabilities. To attack, the attacker must know the system, the vulnerability, how to exploit it, and the specific configuration. If defence in depth, then the attacker must know that for the whole route to them. So, you either have to make those have no vulnerabilities (good luck) or you have to implement measures to prevent their exploitation. That requires changing one or more of the pre-conditions of a successful attack. So, measures that eliminate vulnerabilities by design (eg Correct-by-Construction), prevent their exploitation with obfuscation/transformations, or deny enemy knowledge of their existence all provably increase security. I combine all of these in anything I do with strongest, most-analysed versions of each that are available. Positive field results followed while others get smashed repeatedly.<p>Note: This is especially true if the operational requirement in question, like protecting whole HW lifecycle, is in its infancy in INFOSEC techniques and has little to go on. Then, obfuscation, applying strong stuff where possible, R.E. samples (eg ChipWorks), and layers of detection/audit are best thing you can do. It&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing now. You&#x27;re side would suggest mask/fab/packaging companies should publish all source code and security methods online for attackers to study.

I suppose that if women think that the selection process is biased against them, and most do (and it may be) perhaps the less than excellent ones just don&#x27;t apply, whereas that isn&#x27;t true for males?</i><p>First, the sample size not significant. Adding back one data point, Uber, which was a real data point that was intentionally removed, likely reverses the effect.<p>But imagine we had real sample of thousands of companies, and it did show the result.<p>A typical scenario is that different demographics might connect with First Round via different deal flow channels. For instance, one channel might be longstanding personal connections, another channel might be outreach to companies in the news.<p>Now imagine female founders are much more likely to be found via outreach rather than personal connections. Perhaps this is due to a negative personal bias -- the VC&#x27;s are less likely to be chummy with females because of their sex. So they only find female founders when their company is in the news.<p>It is typical in all businesses that different deal-flow channels have different average returns. So:<p>* If both channels perform equally well, no bias will be seen in the statistics, even though the VC&#x27;s are in fact biased.<p>* If the outbound channel generally performs worse, <i>then women founders in the sample will perform worse than average, even though the VC&#x27;s are actively biased against them</i> (they are ignoring all the women who would have done well, if only that had personally known them. Sine the VC&#x27;s never invest in them, their results are not measured). This is the opposite of the statistical relationship that PG claims should exist.<p>* If the outbound channel generally performs better, then women in the sample will be better than the average.<p>I should also add that the differences in the channels might be due to a positive bias on the part of the VC -- perhaps they do more aggressive outbound outreach in order to get more female founders in the pipeline. Or the difference might be due to something completely neutral.<p>The lesson here is that using statistics is a perilous endeavor. If you want to detect something like bias, you cannot use numbers alone, you need to combine any numbers with a deeper understanding of the selection process. There is no way that a third party can run a simple correlation and determine with any degree of certainty that the field is in fact biased or not.",1446336714

10484785,comment,10474653,10482895,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;The entirety of your argument is that it&#x27;s a good idea to use code or protocol secrecy as a type of secret password.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re getting close to understanding but still not there. Obfuscation is the use of secrecy in code, protocol, configuration, etc to increase knowledge or access required for an attack. What you wrote is <i>partly</i> there but some secrets (eg memory-safety scheme) require more than disclosure to break. Also, what I&#x27;ve always called Security via Diversity claims that everyone relying on a few protocols or implementations means each attack on them automatically can hit huge numbers of users. Therefore, each should be using something different in a way to cause further work or reduce odds of sharing a vulnerability. The difference can be open or obfuscated.<p>&quot;All the rest is a list of non-sequiturs&quot;<p>Then followed followed with claims showing that this makes mass attacks nearly impossible with targeted attacks extremely difficult and with a custom attack required per target. Even getting started on an attack practically requires they&#x27;ve already succeeded in others. You dismiss this as a non-sequitur, which makes no sense. I&#x27;ve substantiated in very specific detail how my method provides great protection vs totally-open, vanilla, standardized-for-all methods. To avoid mere security by obscurity, my methods still utilize and compose the best of openly-vetted methods following their authors&#x27; guidelines to avoid loss of security properties.<p>I also noted this has worked in practice per our monitoring with our systems merely crashing or raising exceptions due to significant vulnerabilities that simply didn&#x27;t work. Success via obfsucation + proven methods was reported by many others including famed Grimes [1] who opposes &quot;security by obscurity&quot; in most writings. Despite arguing against me for decade plus, computer science has started coming around to the idea with many techs published with DARPA funding, etc under the banner &quot;moving target&quot; that try to make each system different with some having mathematical arguments about security they provide. Most are obfuscations at compiler, protocol, or processor level. (Sound familiar?) That field was largely result of people doing what your side said resulting in attackers with hundreds to thousands of 0-days defeating such software with ease with fire-and-forget, kit-based attacks.<p>So, the evidence is on my side. <i>In practice</i>, obfuscating other otherwise proven tech in good configurations greatly benefits security even against pro&#x27;s. I gave clear arguments & examples that it makes attackers&#x27; job more difficult, requires they have inside access, and forces customized attacks instead of mass fire-and-forget kits. On other hand, your counter shows little understanding of what the field has accomplished on defensive side or the economics of malware development on their side. Plus, equates all obfuscation with custom work by the least competent on hardest parts of software. You&#x27;ve only supported keeping amateurs out of obfuscation decisions unless following cookbooks for easy things that are hard to screw up (eg Grimes-style obfuscations). Additionally, you follow up with a ludicrous idea that people unable to use some installers/scripts (all my approach requires) can safely compose and configure arbitrary, complex protocols that such people regularly get wrong in single-protocol deployments. What lol...<p>So, I guess this thread has to be over until you refute the specific claims that have held up in both theory and practice when done by pro&#x27;s. Further, you might want to test your theory by switching to Windows, OpenSSL, Firefox, etc because these have had most review and &quot;pen-tests&quot; by malware authors. Plus, publish all your config and I.P. information online in security and black hat forums for &quot;many eyes&quot; checks. Should make you extra safe if your theory is correct. Mine would imply using a Linux/BDS desktop w/ strong sandboxing, non-Intel where possible, LibreSSL, and automatic transformation of client programs for memory/pointer safety. Been fine, even in pentests by Linux/BSD specialists. Windows, OpenSSL, Firefox, etc? No so much...<p>Good luck with your approach of open, widely attacked software in standard configuraiton that you publish online. You&#x27;re going to need it. :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.06.obscurity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.06.obscuri...</a>",1446336098

It's as simple as that.<p>The difficulty is knowing when the market is down enough for you to make money before you're forced out of the market because you need the money.<p>I don't know if that moment is now, but the pros who work 12 hours on it apparently don't know either. Otherwise they wouldn't be in trouble now.<p>So, let me ask you a different question. What makes you think that kyro would do worse than the pros who lost entire banks by getting in at the top?<p>I'm not saying he should put money in the stock market, but humbleness before those awesome pros that he would be up against is not a good reason to stay out.<p>And by the way, even if you view the market as a zero sum game (which it is not, but that's another debate), you forget one thing: Many pros are forced to sell right now. They are forced to lose because of margin calls, redemptions, minimum capital requirements, etc.<p>So it's not necessarily the admirable wisdom of the pros you are up against right now. They are on the floor. Their hands are tied. They have no choice but to sell to you knowing it's not to their advantage in the long run.<p>If you are 100% in cash and don't need the money within the next 2 years and you don't have to meet margin calls, redemptions or capital requirements, you win, no matter how smart you are compared to the pros.",1232469031

I told my dad, my best friend, begging him not to complain at school. I saw the anger on his face and he told me one thing: prove him wrong son!  I started running every day and lost tons of weight.<p>At my last year of high school the teacher was still around. One day I challenge him in front of a bunch of student and some teachers to run the five miles against him. He was dumb to accept because he failed to realize that I was no more the chubby kid, I was thinner and about 4 inches taller than him. I ran the first 4 miles right behind him and past him at the last mile. I remember the humiliation he put me in years back and called him names on the last stretch in front of everyone.

You should have a solid value add.<p>As far as the 3rd party pulling their API, I think that is a risk you take, but if you are talking about Twitter, where a huge portion of their success is a result of the API, then I wouldn't worry as much. In the case of BOSS, Yahoo! could pull it, but you could probably source search results from elsewhere.<p>As far as offering these services in a paid offering, unless you are adding something significant which the user is paying for, I would think your success would be challenged in the pay model.

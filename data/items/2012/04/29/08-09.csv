That assumes that there <i>is</i> a local startup community. For many people in many locations there won't be. Even when there are startups, there may not be a startup community yet (that's pretty close to true where I live for example - although we're beginning to change that).<p>Maybe ""Get involved in the startup community, the more local the better. If there isn't a local one - consider starting it"".<p>The local business community can also be, accidentally, quite startup unfriendly. You're not going to get the right sort of advice for a web-based technical startup, where most of the local businesses are light industry, or franchises, etc. You have to know enough to figure out when advice is good, and when it only good for people in a certain context. That can be tough at the start.<p><i>Read Hacker News regularly</i><p>Is only good advice if the kind of startup you're interested in starting is the kind of startup hacker news folk are relevant for :-) For example I've been spending some time over the last year with a good old fashioned hardware-technology startup. They've been spending the last seven years developing a new kind of sensing technology (it's cool - they have GIANT LASERS :-). Relevance of hacker news to their business - pretty much zero.<p>Reminder of points.... Great if you're an internet web-based startup. Not so great if that's not where your tendencies lay :-)<p>Although I think I'd take ""Sell something online"" and ""Sell something intangible in person"" and  move them <i>way</i> earlier no matter what the business. Being able to talk to customers and sell stuff is a vital skill. If you can't or don't want to do that - the startup world isn't for you.<p>Actually - thinking on it - maybe ""Talk to customers face to face"" should be the early point. Forget the selling part. Just getting out and talking to folk is a bit step.",1335689659

3905518,comment,3904932,3904932,3,0,buddydvd,,,"Git's submodule feature definitely has rough edges, however, I think the benefits outweigh the cons.<p>One of the best benefits I see is that submodules make embedding forks more manageble. For example, when you include an open source library in your own project, it's common that you'd want to modify the library in some way. If you commit the modified library into your own project's repository, you'll have a harder time absorbing bug fixes/features from upstream later on. Instead of a simple merge, you'd have to check out the updated library somewhere else and use a diff tool to compare the changes. And, if the library changed much, you may need to find the specific commit that your modification were based off so you can understand how to rebase your modifications.<p>In addition, submodules makes it easier to: contribute bug fixes/patches, share modified open source library across different projects, and identify bugs introduced in updated submodules (since the history is preserved).",1335688762

Seriously, there isn't a non-iPhone device out there that can compete with the design of the Lumia 900.<p>Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time dealing with the screen. Text looks like shit, and since most of what I do with my phone involves reading text, this is annoying. I hate that I have to zoom almost every email I get just to get something legible. (That could be more to do with all the wasted space in the email app though)<p>The camera is shit. It's <i>ok</i> in good lighting and completely worthless in low light. I loved that my iPhone camera was good enough that I could capture a moment wherever I was and it would look fine on a computer screen. That's really all I need from the camera. I can't do that with my Lumia because it just won't work in most situations.<p>This could be just my problem, but I don't like the big form factor. My thumb just can't reach the whole screen without uncomfortably stretching. Since Windows Phone navigation relies heavily on the back button, if I'm ever holding it with my right hand, I can barely use it. The big screen is great, but since Windows Phone uses empty space as such a big design element, it cuts down the usable space to be even less than what it was on my iPhone in lots of apps.<p>I really like the flow of most Windows Phone apps, but right now I haven't seen any developers do a good job of making their app stand out. Every app looks exactly the same, with different words in the lists. I don't know if it's just because the platform is still new, or if the APIs are too limiting.<p>But for 100 bucks on contract, it's a good phone, despite all my problems with it.",1335687964

3905475,comment,3904932,3904932,5,0,exDM69,,,"I've said this before but I'll say it again. Stay the hell away from Google's Repo tool. It's a half-baked badly maintained piece of ad-hoc software. It will completely destroy your git workflow. You'll also be married to the crappy review tool called Gerrit.<p>Repo was made prior to Git submodules to do the exact same thing for Android. Now that Git has submodule support, Repo is useless. It does pretty much the same thing as submodules, but it does it in a very crappy way.<p>For example, you cannot go back to a specific set of versions of subdirectories with Repo. In other words there's no ""global"" git bisect as there would be with submodules. This stops you from automatically finding a problem in one of the submodule repos if there are dependencies betweeen the problematic repo and other repositories.",1335687110

It might make sense for syncing with some very stable external projects but that is a very limited use case.<p>I need to have a consistent set of all the submodules I'm working with. I need to reliably get the exact same versions of all the modules in the big repository.

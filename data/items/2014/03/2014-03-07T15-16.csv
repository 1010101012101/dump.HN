7360930,comment,7358870,7359609,12,0,amirmc,,,"> <i>&quot;The meme maybe a cliche but it&#x27;s true&quot;</i><p>No, it is <i>false</i> and that&#x27;s why it needs to die. It prevents a wider discussion about business models and leads to (imho) ridiculously oversimplified views that are restricted to <i>advertising</i> and only <i>within</i> the product in question.  In the worst case, people may use the heuristic that paying for something somehow gives you a voice (it doesn&#x27;t) or prevents a company from productizing you (it doesn&#x27;t).<p>For example, consider the following cases:<p>- Google Apps: I may be paying an annual/monthly fee for using Google&#x27;s services but does that mean they will stop mining all my data and trying to show me &#x27;relevant&#x27; ads <i>elsewhere</i> on the internet?  Just because they have a new revenue stream doesn&#x27;t mean their other revenue models stop working.<p>- Credit cards companies: I&#x27;m probably paying fees and interest for my card but that data is still sold on to others for various purposes, including reference agencies and perhaps aggregate info on spending habits.  I&#x27;ve seen at least a couple of stories on HN about companies willing to sell such data.<p>- Tom Tom: I pay for a navigation device which also provides me with traffic data.  Data from my journey is also sent back to Tom Tom, aggregated and licensed on to external companies who want access to it.  Note that I&#x27;ve already paid for a product, may be paying an additional subscription for traffic data and yet every journey I make is also a revenue generator for them.<p>It&#x27;s only big companies that can afford to pursue multiple revenue streams this way but people are woefully naive if they think a well-resourced company <i>won&#x27;t</i> explore all the ways they could increase their income.<p>Here&#x27;s my reformulation of that meme: You are <i>both</i> the customer <i>and</i> the product.",1394207988

If say Cadbury&#x27;s decided to stop making your favourite chocolate bar, would you feel your rights had been trampled? Or if a shop decided to stop carrying some product you loved. Or if your favourite TV show got cancelled.<p>Or perhaps if the macro environment changes, should the landlord subsidize you when the bank is charging him more? Will the plumber give him a discount because he is a good guy? Will the supplier also give the plumber that discount because he&#x27;s doing some work for a good guy who charges his tenants less than the going rate?<p>And what if the landlord&#x27;s personal circumstances change and he or she desperately needs the money? Say they are no longer able to work?<p>I know that it is disruptive to move house, but in all likelihood the landlord isn&#x27;t a monster, just someone who&#x27;s trying to save for their retirement and has been scared out of pension funds by the smash and grab raid launched in 1997 (which I&#x27;ll note the current lot haven&#x27;t reversed).",1394207976

7360919,comment,7356302,7358826,2,0,twoodfin,,,"I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re reading Wolfowitz&#x27;s quote properly. He&#x27;s saying that the U.S. has leverage over North Korea because their economy is in such a poor state, leverage it didn&#x27;t have over Iraq because of their oil reserves.<p>If you&#x27;re claiming the U.S. would be likely to invade North Korea if they had significant oil reserves, that&#x27;s wrong. As Wolfowitz says in the context around your quote:<p><i>The concern about implosion is not primarily at all a matter of the weapons that North Korea has, but a fear particularly by South Korea and also to some extent China of what the larger implications are for them of having 20 million people on their borders in a state of potential collapse and anarchy.</i><p>...<p><i>In the case of North Korea, the country is teetering on the edge of economic collapse and that I believe is a major point of leverage whereas the military picture with North Korea is very different from that with Iraq.  The problems in both cases have some similarities but the solutions have got to be tailored to the circumstances which are very different.</i><p>Hard to draw from this that the &quot;only&quot; reason invading Iraq was more important was oil. The lack of economic leverage made a military option relatively more practical, as did the military and social situation of Iraq vis a vis its neighbors.",1394207878

7360917,comment,7353767,7354304,3,0,mcgwiz,,,"As with all programming practices, theory and application do not always align, especially when the application achieves cargo cult status.<p>The details of how MyClass calculates due dates should be irrelevant. The test in your example violates this. It makes privileged assumptions to assert implementation details.<p>This is why it&#x27;s better to code and test against interfaces. This makes it harder to make any assumptions about the implementation because it puts the abstraction front and center. A test suite written against an interface can be applied to multiple implementations. This of course requires some dependency orchestration to load different implementations into the suite, as well as to create/avail any needed mocks for that implementation (which ideally are also declared as interfaces). But this limits ripples from implementation changes to the dependency orchestration code.<p>With that in mind, if an implementation&#x27;s internals need testing, then tests can be written against the class itself (rather than any interface). If the class has dependencies, then it should be obvious (or documented) how/when those dependencies will be accessed. When necessitated by the class&#x27;s outward responsibilities, this makes it possible to ensure that a dependency is correctly accessed in certain conditions. E.g. Perhaps it must be ensured that an order processor always asks for validation from a credit card gateway. Your example does not meet this standard.<p>Basic theory aside, I personally agree that high coverage is not worthwhile. I prefer tests that ensure bug fixes don&#x27;t regress, or that are high-level and mimic end-consumer behavior.",1394207846
7360916,comment,7360011,7360671,5,0,jerf,,,"The fuel streaming away visually obscured the fact the wing was missing. While the linked History Channel video appears to be partly reconstruction and partly stock footage manipulated to dramatize the situation, at least part of it appears to have been real footage as well. There&#x27;s an interior cabin angle that appears to show the real plane with the fuel streaming in such a way that it becomes clear why the damage was obscured. There&#x27;s also at least one quick shot they seem to have gotten of the real plane landing, as it is clearly missing a wing at that point.",1394207845
7360914,comment,7360260,7360260,9,0,SpacemanSpiff,,,"So as a pilot of a manned aircraft what does this mean for the safety of my flights? Do I need to start trying to avoid unlicensed, unlit, and unannounced drone aircraft whenever I&#x27;m below 400ft AGL?<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone below for your thoughtful comments. My replies are as follows:\n1) Regarding model aircraft - I would argue that the low density of these operations at the moment is what has prevented an incident between a manned aircraft and model aircraft. Also the nature of radio control has necessitated that the model aircraft generally be withing sight range of the operator, and as such the operator is still able to avoid other aircraft to some extent. This may not be the case for automated drones.<p>2) Regarding 400 ft AGL. How do I know that the drone operator won&#x27;t accidentally end up at 600ft+ AGL (for example), which happens to be at the low end of a standard traffic pattern altitude (800ft)? As far as I know there&#x27;s no way to know what altitude your drone is above the ground except possibly GPS which does not always give you an accurate MSL (or AGL) altitude. Will all drone operators in populated areas be made aware of local air traffic patterns? What if I want to exercise my privilege to operate below 500 ft. AGL in unpopulated areas? I can think of a lot of cases where I&#x27;ve been below 400ft AGL during takeoff and landing while over densely populated areas.<p>My perception is that automated drones with no mechanism to avoid manned aircraft at or near traffic pattern altitude at densely populated locations is a big problem.",1394207844

What is neat is that the system will resolve dependencies as deep as needed and will insert the relevant script and link tags in the correct order.<p>Why is this different?<p>Most package managers focus on the offline development world. This scheme was designed specifically for Plunker [1] which is an online front-end development tool. This means that there are several constraints as well as several opportunities to change the front-end package management workflow.<p>I wanted users to be able to add packages to their existing html markup, however strangely they might have designed it. I also wanted the markup to look &#x27;ok&#x27; after these new packages are inserted. This was quite a challenge. I also didn&#x27;t want to include all of the packages&#x27; code in each Plunk as that would really slow down the service and increase storage costs.<p>As a result, a trade-off (and possibly benefit) I&#x27;ve achieved in this system is that all package ressources must be accessible online (ideally via CDN).<p>The result is a system whereby the markup declares package dependencies and can be introspected and updated to newer package versions and/or to identify existing packages.",1394206922

I do agree with you in general principle though - tips can, and do, go supersonic.<p>Some back-of-the-napkin calculations for the Bear, using the figures given by the media source on wikipedia:\n5.7m prop diameter 750rpm at cruise<p>Circumference = pi*diameter = 18m 750rpm = 12.5 rotations a second<p>Giving a tip speed of 220m/s, so contrary to the media source the blades are not supersonic by themselves.<p>You could, of course, engineer a scenario where the combination of the airflow through the prop + the prop tip speed > mach. But you can do that with a Boeing Stearman too, you just avoid it by design due to the increase in drag, and not to mention the stress placed on prop blade that is subsonic at the root, transonic in the middle, and supersonic at the tip.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people give the noise created by the Bear as evidence of supersonic blades, but I&#x27;d put that down to interactions between the contra-rotating props, a bit like blade slap on a helo.<p>Now the Republic Thunderstreak is an interesting story - a plane with (proven) supersonic blades: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFhSzReWTgs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFhSzReWTgs</a>",1394206604

For context sake, this was right around the time that Apple released their new iMac with NO ADB ports. (USB only) Quark used a hardware dongle even for their educational version (which cost over a thousand dollars if I remember correctly) The company was extremely obtuse when it came to solutions. They suggested I buy an ADB to USB adapter. It flaked out constantly. I tried a few different models. I turned to Quark for help. Almost every conversation with support seemed to be &quot;you don&#x27;t like it? try formatting your text in Microsoft Publisher&quot;. All I was asking was to assist me in using their software - which I had paid for. At that time, they OWNED the market, so anyone that they helped was almost guaranteed to be a future customer. Adobe on the other hand had educational versions of Illustrator and Photoshop for 99 bucks a piece. I graduated when InDesign 1.0 had just come out. No one took it seriously at that point as it was brand new. But Quark&#x27;s &quot;we don&#x27;t care, we don&#x27;t have to&quot; attitude is definitely part of what unseated them.",1394206034

Patents are one of the few things most types of Constitutionally focused Libertarian movements explicitly allow (U.S.C.

And if some act of God means local drinking water becomes undrinkable regardless of efforts to clean, the government also carries out public awareness and warning campaigns and offers remediation guidelines.<p>Nothing stops private industry from providing better than those standards of water, but private industry generally doesn&#x27;t. Given a set of minimal standards, private industry almost always targets those standards (but not better and of course there are exceptions). Now imagine what gets targeted when there are no standards and no enforcement of the standards? Is the water safe? or does it just not taste bad? I&#x27;ve been in countries where there was effectively no government oversight and the water tasted fine, but would land you in a hospital.<p>And there are many cases where private industry gets caught not providing that minimal standard and enforcement actions occur. Or industry that has nothing to do with water provisioning ends up contaminating water so badly that people&#x27;s tap water lights on fire or whatever.<p>Industry self-regulation <i>sometimes</i> works, but just as often has been shown to not work well at all.",1394205394

The closer you are to an age, the more likely you are to reach that age.</i><p>What you&#x27;re doing here is grossly oversimplifying the statistical significance of that fact. You seem to think that all people, regardless of race, genetic profile, income, etc. have equal chance of dying the older they get. This is simply untrue.<p>For example, people between the ages of 50-65 have a higher likelihood of dying from cancer before the age of 85 than somebody who is age 66. This isn&#x27;t simply because the 66 year old has already made it to 66 so is 1/3 of the way ahead of a 55 year old, which is what you seem to be suggesting.<p>The fact is that certain diseases, statistically, have a higher incidence in that 50-65 age band and once you are out of it, your odds of succumbing to those diseases are lower. Sure, the 66 year old could get a clean bill of health and then walk in front of a bus, but the odds are they aren&#x27;t going to die of cancer. That isn&#x27;t insignificant.

7360570,comment,7360076,7360076,56,0,bane,,,"I think this is a good example of what lots of people call the &quot;MBA business model&quot;. It&#x27;s a bit unfair to the MBA, but the idea is this:<p>1. End up in control of a thriving business. Doesn&#x27;t matter how, flashy credentials and a nice suit, mixed with lots of buzz words and business speak usually work.<p>2. Fire everybody responsible for driving the product forward, frame this as &quot;increasing profitability&quot; or &quot;cutting costs&quot; or similar.<p>3. Increase sales staff and squeeze as much blood from this stone as possible.<p>4. When the market for your product inevitably shrinks because you&#x27;ve made your product irrelevant or because of competition or other reasons, blame shifting market winds for making your product irrelevant.<p>5. Sell the product or company off to somebody else, collect cash out your stock, rinse and repeat...or spend some time on your yacht.<p>An anecdote also related to the article. I grew up in family business...not very successful family business, but nevertheless. One of the businesses my family ran for a number of years was a small (very small) print house. Most months it didn&#x27;t generate enough to pay my parent&#x27;s paycheck, but they stuck with it till retirement.<p>One of the interesting things I had a chance to see was the invention and growth of the electronic desktop publishing industry. At the start layout was a <i>very</i> long process of getting blocks of text in a chosen font and size printed on  small dedicated machines not too far removed from what Gutenberg would recognize. Then a specialist would, on a light table, manually cut the text to size, and <i>glue</i> the pieces of the layout to a master sheet. When all the artwork was finally in place, they&#x27;d go and produce a photographic negative of the final page, and then using something like lithography burn the image to a metal sheet which was then used on a press to produce the final page. As you can guess this took forever, but one of the most laborious parts was getting the original little blocks of text made up.<p>Enter the computer age and a small business like my parents could drop $20k for a pre-press dedicated layout system. I don&#x27;t remember too many details of it, but it looked basically like your typical early 80s green screen computer. Everything was typed up by a specialist in some kind of meta-LaTeX-like language. There was a secondary very high res and large for the time black and white graphics preview monitor you could render the page on to get a look and proof (if you had enough memory). Then you could &quot;print&quot; the result to a photoprinter that worked quite a bit like a mini-darkroom. You had to keep various reservoirs stocked with the appropriate photographic chemicals, but the output was state of the art of the time. The rest of the process was virtually identical to the above -- even then it cut turnaround time on a job in-half. I wish I could remember the name of the machine, because I&#x27;ve never seen anything else like it. On occasion, when it broke down, a specialist would be called in to come repair it.<p>Over time, and as small printing business printing got more complex and this system aged, they replaced it a couple of times until eventually they hired a guy who also had his own smaller printing business on the side. They bought him out and he brought in-house a very early full-pre press desktop publishing system with him. Which was Windows 2.0 and a very old version of Aldus PageMaker, I think it was 3.something and a very expensive laser printer. They pretty much stuck with this setup until they sold the company many years later. Basically what this bought was that it essentially removed all the manual gluing and carefully measured layout such that, once a page was setup, you printed it off, took it to the dark room, made your negative and then the plate and the printing was off. It saved <i>days</i> of work.<p>Again, as the business grew more complex, the demand for color and complex layouts increased they started to need to do full color proofs. In printing, one of the principle problems is that, once a design gets through all of the darkroom, lithograph, ink color matching, screens etc. it rarely looks much like the original design. This magnifies when you start working with 2 colors, then gets exponentially more complicated up to 4 (CMYK). So the need for rapid proofs of what the design would <i>probably</i> look like became more and more important -- even then the proof only had a passing resemblance to the final product. Unfortunately, the equipment that could produce these proofs was prohibitively expensive. So my parent&#x27;s graphics guy would outsource his designs to a graphics bureau to make a proof. I think a few pages might take a day or two to turn around and cost a couple hundred dollars.<p>I used to deliver the disks over to the bureau and remember the first time I walked in. A gleaming open room, packed full of Macintoshes running QuarkXPress and PageMaker, and some very expensive printer looking devices all along a back wall. I&#x27;d give them the disk and the job order and inevitably get a groan when I pointed out that it was a PC formatted disk (this was back in the days that this mattered). &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s you guys, when are you ever going to get a Mac and get Quark? It&#x27;ll make this much easier.&quot; They&#x27;d wheel out, on a movable desk, an old PC, blow the dust off and fire it up and make sure the disk was readable. &quot;Okay, we&#x27;ll <i>sigh</i> call you when it&#x27;s done.&quot;<p>Various incompatibilities with some of their proof making equipment and their PC caused lots of time and cost overruns, but it had to be done. I&#x27;m pretty sure, in the local market they worked in, they may have been the only PC graphics shop around. It sucked interfacing with the rest of the market, but at the same time, <i>everybody</i> who brought in their own artwork did that work on a PC, not a Mac. All the churches and parents getting wedding invitations, all the small businesses getting tri-fold fliers, <i>all</i> of them. And they got lots of business because other companies refused to deal with their homespun PC formatted artwork.<p>I don&#x27;t have a point, just thought I&#x27;d add a little first hand history.",1394204586

Anyone learning Haskell will be coming in with no exposure to any other pure language, and that has big implications.  There is a fundamental difference between the &quot;contents <- readFile ...&quot; line above and the next two lines that you have never encountered before in any other language.  You&#x27;ll probably have a pretty difficult time with it if you don&#x27;t understand a little more about how the readFile function is different from the lines function and what that means for how you can use them.  You can&#x27;t just mindlessly copy examples from small day to day tasks like you can with other languages because Haskell is unlike any other language you know.<p>Please don&#x27;t read the above paragraph to mean that Haskell is not suitable for these kinds of small tasks.  I actually think that Haskell makes a fantastic scripting language.  I&#x27;m just saying that you can&#x27;t learn it like you learn other scripting languages.  You need to get a bigger understanding of what&#x27;s going on otherwise you&#x27;ll end up frustrated about why things don&#x27;t work the way you expect.<p>All that being said, I still HIGHLY recommend learning Haskell.",1394204470

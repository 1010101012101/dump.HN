So I think filesharing will have a number of effects:<p>Movies and games will get cheaper to produce<p>People will make less financially ambitious movies and games<p>Some movies and games will be funded by varients of the Street Performer Protocol -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Performer_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Performer_Protocol</a><p>Some movies or games will be funded by the state. Organisations such as the BBC do this today. Possibly there will be a broadband tax to fund the creation of downloadable works, along the lines of this proposal: <a href=""http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/a-broadband-tax-for-the-uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/a-broadband-tax-fo...</a>",1236070769

501222,comment,500753,500995,0,0,hedgehog,,,"I carried the EEE 701 over about 8 months of travel and it was great. Bump the RAM to 2GB and install your OS of choice and it's really a pretty capable machine. The screen is a bit small but the new round (EEE 90x and stuff from Dell and whatnot) look like they solve that problem. Two tricks I learned:<p>- The 701 fits inside a one gallon zip lock, letting you transport it in the rain and on boats without too much worry.<p>- There's a extension for FF 3+ called ""Default FullZoom Level"" which lets you change the default page zoom level. On a small screen that makes a big difference (think about all those 850+ pixel grid layouts on a 800px wide screen).<p>- Compiz works great on the GMA950 and the Expose-style window switcher works really well for small screens. On GMA950 Compiz breaks GLUT but other than that I didn't run in to any problems (or: make sure your code builds _and_ runs before you leave town).",1236070477

Even during Japan's recession, the US economy helped keep Japan going.  People and countries all over the world invest in the US dollar - Even today, when interest rates are at an all time low, T-Bills are still considered safe investments.<p>Will the economy continue to change and evolve?  Of course.  But America's place in the world economy is not likely to change in the near future.",1236070205

501217,comment,500781,500955,0,0,ken,,,"And it's not just bugs, but lack of features.  For example, I have requirements for simple 2D graphics with client-side interactivity.  If we only had to support Firefox/Safari/Opera/Chrome, we could use SVG, but for users with IE (which has neither SVG or Canvas), that means Flash.  Doing simple graphics with Flash is well over 10x more work than just splatting some XML inline into your page (which I've also done for personal side projects).<p>Consider, for example, that Flash/IE is a completely different plugin than Flash/all-other-browsers.  We've definitely had Flash compatibility bugs between major versions, between minor versions, and even between the ""same version"" on different browsers.  I can think of a few that took many of us more than 30 minutes just to trace through, much less come up with a workaround.  And all of this only because IE (even IE8, AFAICT) doesn't natively support any kind of client-side graphics.<p>I don't know where the 30% overhead estimate for IE came from -- maybe a simple site?  That sounds really, really low to me.  I would put it at least 100% overhead for the kinds of things I do.",1236069935
501216,comment,501088,501179,0,0,danteembermage,,,"If you think about options as a form of insurance, then we can infer something about the marginal investors beliefs about various scenarios by the price they're willing to pay to protect themselves from them.<p>Right now, the risk-neutral expectation is that the S&P will appreciate by 5 to 30% over the next year, but the strong concern that the market will drop catastrophically drives up demand for insurance against a depression. So on average the options market looks pessimistic even though in some sense the median belief is that the market will go up.<p>This is not the way perceptions have to go, for example the greatest mass of investors might have been around -5% to -30% but a smaller group, convinced the market would quickly rebound to beyond its former glory, might produce a net effect of slightly rosy.<p>So in essence using options prices we can determine that in general investors are not thinking ""yay, bargains"" rather ""yikes, mattress""",1236069688

501204,comment,500393,500393,0,0,bodhi,,,"When I was working with migrations and ActiveRecord a couple of years ago, we just treated the production database as authoritative. We basically used migrations as disposable chunks of code that would transform the database from state a to state b. If a migration from 3 months ago didn't work anymore it really didn't matter, as the production database was well beyond that point anyway. When we needed to test the migrations, we'd load the most recent backup of the production database into our dev dbs and try it out.<p>But we did have the luxury of running a (fairly small-scale) website rather than distributing an application.",1236067947

The real question is can someone make a prediction, commit capital, and realize a gain based on those predictions.  Only time will tell, and for those of use watching from the sidelines, it's virtually impossible to tell who will be right, and if they are right that it's because they deeply understand the fundamentals of the problem versus just randomly having the right prediction for the wrong reasons.",1236067589

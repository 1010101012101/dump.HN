NIO has solved that for networks, but the whole java framework/idioms push you towards threads where it shouldn't.<p>> Where? I'm starting to think people dislike Java for the community / way it's used in enterprise rather than anything to do with the language. There's no push toward threading in the language :/ And NIO has been around for years.<p>I've used Java (and was burnt by it) before NIO made its appearance -- it was 2002 or maybe even 2003. I recently had to join a Java project that's ""only"" been around 2 years, so it could have benefited from the years of NIO -- but other than the base language, there is no async interface to be found. You want to talk to a database or key value store? You have to block (meaning thread). Want to do a URL fetch? you have to block, because there is no non-blocking libraries to be found.<p>It's not that it is impossible to do -- it is quite possible -- but it is almost against java culture.<p>> Where? I'm starting to think people dislike Java for the community / way it's used in enterprise rather than anything to do with the language.<p>You can say that again!<p>The java language is, I guess, ok (I don't like it, but it's mostly a matter of taste). The java ecosystem encourages verbosity-for-verbosity's sake, engineering-for-engineering sake, and ignoring common sense in the name of ""purity"".<p>That Java project I joined, for example, has hundreds of classes that do nothing but store a field or two, have getters and setters for them, and perhaps have one ""action"" in them. Each such class is only a couple of hundred lines. This is totally useless, and when optimization time comes (and it comes, because the project is running too slow because of hundreds of layers of encapsulation), it is nearly impossible to find a culprit because everything is spread thin through hundreds of useless classes.<p>I put up a plea for good java code on HN a few days ago: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2094274"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2094274</a> it didn't get high enough to ellicit much response (20 on the ""ask hn"" page, not sure how far on the main). But the responses that are there did not cause me to re-evaluate.<p>> - No way to tell how things are implemented. What?? Look at the source code. Decompile the class file into byte code :/<p>I have a merge sort that takes 40x long as it does in C. The reason I needed to implement it myself is that for the 400MB of data I'm looking it, the library tried to allocate over 2GB (which is all the deployment machine has), and that's just my test data -- when I try to sort 2GB of data, it would have required ~10GB.<p>I carefully wrote it so that no object gets allocated during the sort. 40x slower than C. WTF? Perhaps that MemoryMappedByteBuffer I am using does not inline it's "".get()"" method -- that would explain x5, I think, not x40. But I have no frigging way of checking.<p>I am doing high performance code, which I agree is not common, but my experience with Hadoop (which is becoming ever more popular) is that the design decisions are such that the performance cost is x10 for just using hadoop compared to writing straightforward code -- meaning you would need 10 nodes to just break even.<p>I've been burnt by Java.

2106089,comment,2105053,2105053,0,0,wintyfresh,,,"I'm writing this from Hong Kong, where I run a scholarship for young entrepreneurs in mainland China. A few thoughts:<p>-To understand the mentality of a Chinese parent, you need to know a few things. First, the obvious one child policy, and the expectation that this one child will support their children but also their parents and grandparents (no social security, minuscule pensions and a non-existent safety net). This puts an enormous pressure on the individual to have a stable and high wage job. Lots of people on these boards are in startups (or would like to be), but few Chinese nationals are willing to take that route due to the immense risks involved. They're gambling not only their personal wealth but also the survival of their family.<p>-School is brutal, particularly college admissions. Each student at the end of high school takes something called the gaokao. Imagine the SAT on steroids (2 days long) that you only take one and almost wholly determines what ""tier"" of college you get admitted into. You can take it once a year, and if you fail, you have a second chance one year later (the intervening year is usually spent studying 14+ hrs a day). You pour a gazillion college-bound kids into this crucible of death, with only a scant few slots at the other end. Even for the student goes abroad to study, they've been indoctrinated with the cutthroat and ""success at all costs"" mentality necessary to get ahead in China. It's a numbers game, and the numbers are stacked to make your life hell.<p>What does this have to do with obsessive parents? Take these last two facts and mix in some historical perspective. Many of these parents either lived through or are sufficiently proximate to the turmoil of the 1960's and 1970's to know how brutal life can be for those that do not get ahead. It's not the American poverty of temp labor and living in a trailer park; it's the poverty of starving to death. It's the poverty of not having shelter from the cold, of having zero access to medical care. While this is less true of today's China, the fear of this poverty survives, even for those in relative affluence (think of your grandparents that lived through the depression and still are obsessively thrifty).<p>I can understand why these parents are monomaniacal in ensuring (or trying to ensure) a better life for their kids. With grueling competition, a one-child policy, scant social safety nets and a vivid memory of how brutal China can be, it makes sense.",1295053245

Okay, so the consumer saves a buck, but then you chip away at their goodwill every time you show an ad.  And note, when you're showing an ad, to make it effective you have to make it intrusive, you either have to lock them out of the free functionality for a while or you need to make it eye-catching.<p>I don't know anyone that said ""I'm so glad Google bought Youtube and plastered ads all over the videos"".<p><i>People hate advertising</i> so much they will go out of their way to avoid it.<p>In economic terms, as an app developer the way I see it is that free+ads is really just burning up my user's good will to enrich Google.  The more I annoy my customers like this, the less likely they are to recommend my app.  To the extent that it is less than a zero-sum game... it's not just an even 50:50 trade-off between for pay and ad-supported.",1295053218

It looks like a large transformer (what kind of bug needs a 20-60W transformer??) and a crappy wiring job. It looks like maybe wiring for lights for a vanity mirror in the bathroom. I think the bottom of the image is a mirror reflecting a roll of toilet paper.",1295053216

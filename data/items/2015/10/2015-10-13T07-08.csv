In very rare circumstances there is no subsidized option for a particular drug, in which case, again, you are free to purchase it with your own money, or hold supplemental private insurance.<p>And absolutely you want the people in charge to determine the value of a year of quality life, when trying to maximize health outcomes for a certain budget.

Rather, I thought she was saying that, since women don&#x27;t as often present with hyperactive type ADHD as males, the general message is &quot;girls have less ADHD.&quot; Which, then, can impair seeking a diagnosis for a female that has the disorder, since there&#x27;s a general bias to look for other things first.<p>As far as I&#x27;ve ever understood the inattentive type goes under-diagnosed for both sexes, as it&#x27;s not as disruptive to classrooms, where most diagnoses are started for children. The hyperactive type may be more often diagnosed based on comparisons between US and European diagnostic criteria -- the European model results in fewer diagnoses[1].<p>The author discusses this early in the piece:<p><i>[Dr. Ellen Littman attributes under-diagnosis in part] &quot;to the early clinical studies of ADHD in the 1970s. “These studies were based on really hyperactive young white boys who were taken to clinics,” Littman says. “The diagnostic criteria were developed based on those studies. As a result, those criteria over-represent the symptoms you see in young boys, making it difficult for girls to be diagnosed unless they behave like hyperactive boys.”</i><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#cite_note-Cowen2012-13"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivit...</a>",1444721715

It really isn&#x27;t that hard to avoid saying offensive and distasteful things to women (or anyone else, actually). It&#x27;s almost <i>always</i> obvious that some statements are pretty offensive or at the very least make people uncomfortable, and it only takes the smallest modicum of common sense and tact to avoid saying those things. &quot;You&#x27;re too hot to be an engineer&quot; is an awkward thing to say to a woman in an elevator, and if you&#x27;re a woman in tech, you&#x27;re bombarded with those statements weekly. It&#x27;s not about being brittle. It&#x27;s about letting people know when what they&#x27;re saying is garbage. If anything, the men complaining about how they don&#x27;t like having to think before speaking are brittle.<p>Speaking as a man that manages to &quot;navigate the PC minefield&quot; every day, it really isn&#x27;t difficult.

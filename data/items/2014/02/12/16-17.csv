We now have an LLVM frontend for Javascript, so Javascript code can be turned into LLVM bytecode.<p>The next step would be to swap out the existing Javascript runtimes with this frontend plus a sandboxed backend for the native platform so they can compile Javascript to LLVM bytecode, then to native code.<p>Finally, you add an extension to the <script> tag to allow loading arbitrary LLVM bytecode, something like <script src=&quot;<a href=""http://some/url/code.llvm&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://some/url/code.llvm&quot;</a> type=&quot;text/llvm&quot;>.<p>Once that&#x27;s in place then you&#x27;d be able to execute any language that has an LLVM front end inside the browser environment. Javascript is no longer the sole language of the web, and things like Emscripten and asm.js become obsolete.",1392224380

7225430,comment,7224994,7224994,3,0,rprospero,,,"Honestly, the reason that programming is getting a reputation for being easy is because it is easy.  That&#x27;s entirely the point of computer programming.  If writing a program was harder than doing it by hand, we would just do it by hand.<p>Honestly, any other profession would love to have it as easy as we have it.  A surgeon doesn&#x27;t get to mount the backup after a surgery fails.  The engineers of the Mississippi river bridge couldn&#x27;t checkout a standing bridge from their git repo.  When a physicist wants to study particle physics, she can&#x27;t download her own, personal LHC and start smashing protons.  CEO&#x27;s don&#x27;t get separate development and testing companies where they can try out their business plans before it gets promoted to the actual corporation.<p>Compared to everything else I do at work, programming is by far the easiest task.  It&#x27;s also the easiest to learn.  Yes, a lot of those programers are pretty terrible, but there&#x27;s a lot of terrible drivers, too.",1392224322

I think there&#x27;s a big difference between people having the potential for meanness within them and indulging that in a way that magnifies and sharpens it.<p>There are definitely contexts where people will talk honestly about the assholish thoughts and feelings we all have.

In some states its even illegal to call yourself a softare engineer (or [insert word here] engineer, without having an &quot;engineering&quot; degree. Secondly, the major problem to start out with is the proper business definitions / rules for which the software is designed for. Because software devs/*neers have a more &quot;generalized&quot; tool building education (either/or work experience / degree education), the understsanding has to come from both sides - we explore the capabilities and compare that to the process you are trying to map for your industry.

7225409,comment,7218184,7224992,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Well, not really. The first 64 bits are not all possible. They are subdivided, since some addresses are link-local, some are multicast, etc. Then, Comcast only has a certain allocation of that. On top of that, could one find a patter in how they allocate their addresses?<p>The second 64 bits are also not quite random. Most of your devices will autoconfigure using radvd. This means that the second 64 bits depend on their MAC address. Now, if I knew of an exploit to, say, a printer or a NAS device, I would know the MAC address range. My guess is that I could probably reduce the 128 bit address space to something like 100 or even 90 bits.<p>Second, and this makes it all the above a moot point, don&#x27;t your devices connect to the internet? Any time they connect to a site, that site knows the IP address and that data may be used either explicitly or leaked and used by someone else. Everyone between you and the site also knows the address.<p>Lastly, if you ever set up a DNS record for any of these addresses, they are then visible to others even with some scanning if you don&#x27;t ever publish the actual names.<p>Long story short, there is hoping you don&#x27;t get hacked and there is knowing you have a firewall that only allows what you want in.",1392224183

It helps users discover the shortest path to master a given subject.\nIn addition, we’re planning to differentiate by developing educator/tutor-focused functions, such as questions editing and lessons curation.<p>Now, we face two critical questions as we try to decide our focus while preparing to apply for accelerators this year.<p>1. what should we focus, user acquisition or more demo-grade functions?\nUser acquisition would require enhancing our Discovery algorithm and completing admin-related functions. These functions will help us acquire more test-taker users. \nOn the other hand, if we do more demo functions, we will develop tutor-focused use cases, such as questions editor. Given our time constraints, these will be demo-grade and we probably won’t be able to market them to acquire users.<p>2. what accelerator should we target, general (Y Combinator/Techstar) or education-focused (Imagine K12)?\nThis is somewhat related to the first question because if we target education-focused accelerator, we would focus more on demo-grade functions for educators/tutors as they play a significant role in the ecosystem. FYI, we already tried for Y Combinator twice but never got invited for an interview so we’re thinking that we may not be the right fit...although we’ll probably try again.<p>So given those considerations, we&#x27;d really appreciate if you experts can help us with comments.\nThanks in advance.<p>www.cuve.me",1392223782

Creating a compressed archive is exactly the sort of thing that Make was designed for. A binary file or library, if you squint the right way, is just an archive of object files, which are just transformations of .c files.<p>Make&#x27;s biggest problems for me (and the reason that I&#x27;m slowly gravitating towards writing a replacement for my own purposes) come from the fact that it can&#x27;t handle inferring dependency graphs correctly. The usual &#x27;gcc -M&#x27; hacks that work for C source don&#x27;t work for code where dependency tracking is more than just an optimization. For C, remember, as long as you have the appropriate headers and .c files, you can build a .o file completely order-independent.<p>If you have a dependency digraph that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    a -> b, c, d\n    b -> c, d\n    c -> d\n    d\n</code></pre>\nThen you need to build in this order:<p><pre><code>    d, c, b, a\n</code></pre>\nWithout some way of explicitly generating these dependencies ahead of time (which, I admit, is doable), you can&#x27;t get make to do this properly. The best hack I can think of would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    depfile: $(SOURCES)\n            update-deps -o $@ $?\n\n    include depfile\n</code></pre>\nBut at that point, you&#x27;re pretty much generating a makefile with another tool, scanning all changed sourcs, at which point you might as well move on to just building the DAG and running the build on them while you&#x27;re at it.",1392223709

As literacy matured, and became widespread, they were out of a job. And it wasn&#x27;t because they somehow became bad at their work. It was because they became obsolete.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not arguing this will happen quickly, and it may look different, but I can&#x27;t help but look around and see how much more accessible basic programming has become (tryruby.org and all the others).

My general point (which maybe you don&#x27;t care about) is along these lines: A regular currency operates usually exclusively in one area, and in that area can be used for all spending. Strictly speaking, it could still run if currency exchanges suddenly vanished (and before informal replacements took over). A currency is after all not simply a commodity, it is the legally acceptable form of payment for all debts in that area (and <i>must</i> be accepted). Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not required to be accepted anywhere. In addition, most people value Bitcoin because it&#x27;s worth a lot of US dollars. So its value seems more connected to the existence of exchanges than normal currencies, which at least can operate inside their own countries without any currency exchanges. (It&#x27;s not quite as neat as that but the point is in the comparison to Bitcoin.) The further sensitivity to exchanges is because, since you are payed in other currencies, you are <i>constantly</i> evaluating Bitcoin&#x27;s worth in terms of those currencies.

At the very least, a moment must be taken to fix in your mind the specific problem you want to solve and how you intend to solve it.  At most, large projects may require months of up-front specification and planning (though there is much disagreement about how much is too much, and where the point of diminishing returns lies).<p>This question aims at the midpoint between the trivial and the gargantuan, at tasks that demand more than a simple script but less than a large development team.  It also aims especially at work in lower-level languages such as C, because they usually require more careful design before coding begins, but thoughts on other languages and environments are also welcome.<p>So: What do you do before you start to code?  Do you write down a problem statement and design sketch in your native language?  Do you make diagrams, on paper or onscreen?  How do you know when it&#x27;s time to start coding?

When a generated password cannot be easily copy-pasted, the whole system feels unwieldy.<p>But Clef doesn&#x27;t seem to solve anything in that respect. It solves some of the same problems that password managers do but with extra environmental requirements.<p>I can see the Clef mechanism being useful for 2-factor authentification. But I&#x27;m unenthused with (and wary of) its current instantiation as a login skeleton key. If I were Clef, I&#x27;d set my sights lower and rebrand as a drop-in 2-factor auth system to be <i>optionally</i> enabled by users.<p>> Clef puts military grade cryptography in the hands of every user<p>This kind of line is deceptive for 99% of end-users and turns off the 1% who might be helpful as developers.",1392222270

The difference between a government and a private entity in this situation is that the government can force you to pay taxes to pay for this river management whether you interact with the river or not, or else you get imprisoned. On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t want to interact with the private owner of the river, then you don&#x27;t have to. The world is round; go the other way. The river is only so long; go around it. The river is on the surface of the planet; fly above it.<p>Now, I have NOT said that I subscribe to a full-on anarcho-capitalist system; I mainly understand the theory behind it, and think that it makes the best theory ON WHICH TO BASE A PRACTICAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.

Rather, language is a living, breathing thing and grammar is closer to history than mechanics.<p>Consider the less v. fewer debate. Yes, several hundred years ago, it was just fine to say &quot;less corrections.&quot; However, for whatever reason, the upper crust decided that &quot;fewer corrections&quot; both looked and sounded better. Consequently, &quot;less corrections&quot; evolved to be less correct. My inner smartass wanted to say &quot;fewer correct&quot;, but that would be a silly joke.<p>It&#x27;s like Russian. If you speak French, you can understand many Russian words. This isn&#x27;t because French and Russian are linguistic cousins. Rather, it&#x27;s because French was the language of nobility and words trickled down.<p>Or heck, we could talk about the word &quot;you.&quot; You was originally formal, whereas &quot;thou&quot; was more relaxed and informal. Yet, today, if I started a comment on Hacker News with, &quot;I fear thou are wrong&quot;, it would seem needlessly formal.<p>To conclude this long mess (it was supposed to be four lines and turned into paragraphs), language evolves constantly. Though certain distinctions didn&#x27;t exist in earlier English, they exist now. However, if you know much about the history and formation of English, you should be less pedantic. It should also make us much more tolerant of people for whom English isn&#x27;t their native language. We speak an intensely complex language with random rules that apply in some cases and not others.<p>Thank heavens we don&#x27;t have to compile our language before we speak it...:)",1392222168

When I viewed the source code on the page, I was able to bookmark that, and I will definitely be coming back to this article in the future. (I have already shared it among my Facebook friends.)<p>The comments here are interesting, as the last time this issue came up on Hacker News, I was reading more anecdotes about public data searches on individuals that mostly turn up junk data (which has been my experience). Way back in the 1980s, I attended a presentation at a law firm where I then worked and was told that with simply a former telephone number, all kinds of interesting information could be found about a person. So I gave the company representative one of my previous phone numbers from childhood, and he found next to nothing about me, and some of what was found was erroneous. I was not impressed.<p>By the 1990s, I had a lot of online presence, and when AltaVista was still the dominant search engine a friend of mine in another city (we had met in Taiwan) began using my name as a search term in training his colleagues in how to do online searching, as a search on my name reliably turned up a lot of hits. Google finds plenty of information about me, of course, and has become better and better at sorting the most useful information about me to the top of the search results over the years. I am aware that cyberstalkers, like point-of-view pushers who have tried to drive me away from Wikipedia editing, can go from my Wikipedia screen name (unique to Wikipedia) to find out other information about me, including telephone numbers. But I&#x27;m still on Wikipedia after they have been banned, so all&#x27;s well that ends well. The harassing phone call trick to suppress my free expression of fact and opinion on online forums was tried as long ago as 1993, so I&#x27;m used to it.<p>Most of the emails that come to me off-forum about my Hacker News comments address me by name, so it&#x27;s not a hard research problem to link my Hacker News screen name to my real name. (A harder problem is distinguishing me from the subsequent people who began using my screen name here after I first used it on another forum, beginning in 2004.) Yeah, foolproof privacy is difficult to achieve. I usually don&#x27;t go snooping, and for the most part I have no idea who I am talking to here on HN. I figure that the old days of living in a village with a small group of people who were mostly all extended family relatives probably didn&#x27;t offer much privacy either, so I&#x27;m not particularly worried about the modern world, but I wonder how much more Privacy by Design<p><a href=""http://www.privacybydesign.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.privacybydesign.ca/</a><p>concepts can catch on in everyday practice in most industries for more of what we each do in daily life.<p>If you would like to comment about this, I won&#x27;t try to figure out who you are away from HN.",1392221796

Note that while I agree that just because something is in the stdlib doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s idiomatic, I also cite that this particular approach is used to make the <i>structure and organization</i> of code more clear. Since it&#x27;s used in several packages, I claim that this is a strong hint that panic/recover is appropriate in limited scenarios.<p>> Without seeing specific code I can&#x27;t say for sure, but it&#x27;s very unlikely that any database interaction code is best modeled with panic/recover for error handling. I&#x27;m very curious to see the source, at this point.<p>It&#x27;s really not that hard to imagine. For example: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/fhpRLd8EHY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/fhpRLd8EHY</a><p>We seem to have some wires crossed. Let&#x27;s be clear, shall we?<p>* The panic/recover idiom is rarely used, but it <i>is</i> an idiom.<p>* There are trade-offs involved with using panic/recover. In my sample linked in this comment, many of the functions in database/sql need to be stubbed out so that they panic. However, the cost of this is relatively small, since it can mostly be isolated in a package.<p>* The idiom is most frequently seen in parsing because there are a lot of error cases to handle <i>and</i> the response to each error is typically the same.<p>* While parsing is the common scenario, I claim it is not the only one. I cite that database work is profligate with error checking, and <i>depending on your application</i>, there&#x27;s a reasonable chance that the response to each error is going to be the same. When doing a lot of it, it can pay off to use the panic/recover idiom with similar benefits as for doing it with parsing.<p>* There may well be other scenarios where such handling is appropriate, but I have not come across them.<p>I&#x27;ve done an unusual amount of work with parsers and have done some database work, so I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to bump up against the panic/recover idiom a bit more than normal. As with anything else, it can be abused. But I find it extraordinarily useful in certain situations.",1392221766

As someone who spent my first years also as a contractor (I&#x27;ve since been hired), this is incredibly unprofessional and against the code of ethics. At Apple you learn that you&#x27;re part of a team, that you are just one piece of the greater picture, so to brag so much when you are such a small and new piece, is incredibly conceited. I would have never let him work on anything secret or prolific - he seems like the guy who would hog all the credit.<p>- As someone who contracted for over a year, if I had misgivings about my manager, I would have spoken up. If I couldn&#x27;t have gained the courage to talk with the manager directly, I would have gone to his superiors, or to at least the contact person at the contracting agency. From my experience, Apple&#x27;s management hierarchy is built to facilitate things like this. I&#x27;m sure his boss&#x27;s boss was around, and all he had to do is speak up if he really had such strong grievances about his treatment.<p>- I find it hard to believe that he was really worked that hard. Additionally, if he had such strong reservations about wanting to have normal work hours and being home at an early hour, he should not have picked a job that required a 45+ minute commute.<p>So not only does this guy quit in a wholly unprofessional manner, but now he has the audacity to go all over the Internet to whine about it.<p>Good luck finding a new job, buddy, at least you have good design chops.

Doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a standard to me, and declaring that by so doing you hope to make a dent in the universe doesn&#x27;t make it any moreso.<p>So, I&#x27;d ask Mr. Andreessen, &quot;Is that it? Does the desire to make products that people love qualify for a16z&#x27;s mission requirement?&quot; Because, if so, then I&#x27;m having trouble seeing where that investment philosophy really differs.<p>The other part is with regard to recruiting and the overall SV ethos. It may be true that select people want to work for companies with a mission. And, maybe many do--<i>all things being equal</i>. But, his &quot;insight&quot; that a person would rather work for $120K plus a mission than $120K and no mission is self-evident and doesn&#x27;t tell us anything. The test of his theory is whether people are willing to work for $60K plus a mission.<p>And the thing is we know that so many people are really just chasing a buck. We see this in what has been coming out of SV; the glut of copycat and uninspired businesses aimed at this or that trivial opportunity and the relative dearth of companies taking on really hard or &quot;mission-worthy&quot; challenges.<p>I am not saying that there are zero companies of the latter ilk. I am saying that this article is making statements about the current reality that just don&#x27;t ring true. Look no further than the &quot;fail-fast&quot;, &quot;iterate quickly&quot;, &quot;look for pivots&quot;, &quot;find product-market fit&quot; culture that has dominated SV over recent years.  Do any of those things sound conducive to building companies that are on a mission? Or do they sound more applicable to companies that are just looking to make a buck any way they can?<p>Maybe Mr. Andreessen is decrying that same culture. But, the article doesn&#x27;t help by making declarations about the current state that don&#x27;t appear to be accurate.",1392221428

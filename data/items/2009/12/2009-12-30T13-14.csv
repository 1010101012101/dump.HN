From my experience,  H1B workers from India are very under-qualified. They are usually hired for their low pay demands not for exceptional knowledge.   I don't want to start a flame war,   this is just my experience, but the level of knowledge of some H1B employees is that of a someone taking a few community college courses.   No theortical background. Most don't know what an algorithm is,  instead they repeat a set of jargon IT words they read somewhere in a book.<p>While we are on the stereotyping  bandwagon,  I have noticed that programmers from Eastern Europe & former Soviet Block have a much better grasp of CS theory and math.  Chinese programmers fall somewhere in between.<p>Again, downvote if you like, this is just what I observed, I don't know why that is and your experience will probably vary.",1262181492
1022404,comment,1020638,1022232,0,0,jpv,,,"The ""3rd world country"" line wasn't the point - I think you missed it altogether.<p>Smoking has a bit of a culture - when you're smoking somewhere, and someone else is smoking, that's something you can physically talk to them about. You can saunter up to them and say ""Virginia blend, eh? Never tried that"" and you immediately have a conversation, provided they're not an asshole. It can be something that brings a group together: ""Hey lets stop watching this movie and go outside and smoke."" And it is very social: it's tough to NOT talk if you're just sitting around with some guys smoking. It can also just be something to do with your hands - for me, at least, it gets rid of the anxious foot-tapping or knuckle cracking and lets me just sit back and smoke and enjoy someone else's company.<p>Basically what I'm trying to say is that today we are caught up by ""interactive distractions"" rather than actual human interaction. Smoking socially changes that. </rant>",1262181478

1022392,comment,1021772,1022032,0,0,elblanco,,,"The problem is that the vast majority of the time, the people with the fake degrees also don't have any of the skills the degree ""certifies"" them as having. I've seen a few very notable cases where a person with a fake degree cost a company six figures in disastrous projects that relied on those people as having a basic education in their field.<p>In the grand scheme of things, $20-30k over 4 years is not a whole hell of a lot of money. And this is coming from somebody that paid for college out-of-pocket while supporting a wife (who couldn't work at the time and also was going to school) and earning less than $20k/yr. Leaving school with that kind of debt is almost inconsequential since you'll likely get a job that pays you well enough to live decently <i>and</i> pay back whatever debt you have with extra left over to eat steak.<p>Sure I had to suffer for a few (six) years to get my undegrad, but my first job out of school paid enough that I was able to live at a far better standard of living than I did during school, and still pay back the loans in about 4 years (and all the while, every year it got better and better as I got promotions and pay raises).",1262180585

Her father was a surgeon. The medical license and degrees weren't recognized here. He worked as a janitor at night while going to school (again) to qualify for the board exams.<p>I've noticed in many organizations that universities in India are sometimes viewed with suspicious as the quality of the output (in the IT field) can vary wildly. The ITTTs for example are considered fine, but there are hundreds of other schools that are very hard to get any visibility on. In a few disastrous cases I've seen, people were hired based on their 4 year degree in CS or IS or IT, yet they graduated without ever having written a single line of code!

9545490,comment,9540852,9540852,0,0,tsuyoshi,,,"Another issue, comparing the MLton FFI and the Ocaml FFI, is that the FFI in MLton is somewhat slower. When I converted an Ocaml program to SML, I discovered that a small portion written in C ran much faster when I rewrote it in SML. In Ocaml, writing portions in C is almost always a performance win, just because the Ocaml compiler doesn&#x27;t optimize very well. In MLton there&#x27;s a bit of overhead just for the FFI (possibly because the code generator allocates registers very differently from how it&#x27;s done in C). That overhead goes away if you use the C code generator instead, but usually the native code generator performs better anyway.<p>If I remember correctly, it has been proposed to rewrite the MLton floating point conversion in pure SML for precisely this reason.",1431615241

9545340,comment,9543889,9543889,0,0,jfaucett,,,"I&#x27;ve learned several languages in my life, I&#x27;m trilingual now, and I&#x27;ve succeeded on some and failed miserably on others. Here&#x27;s my experience and advice.<p>First, I guess you could say I learned Spanish, but really I was so young it never even felt like learning it, so I can&#x27;t give you much advice from that account, just that speaking it was hard for me, I could literally feel things get clogged on the way from my brain to the sounds coming out of my mouth - it was wierd but went away quickly enough. The only advice here is that you should probably be speaking the language a lot to train those brain to mouth muscles :)<p>The language I really had to learn though was German, it was later in life at around 20 when I started learning it.<p>From German I think the take away is dedication. You have to be motivated and seriously dedicated in order to learn a language. I literally spent hundreds of hours absorbed in German. I would listen to Deutsche Welle radio all the time and lookup words I didn&#x27;t know. I would always try to visualize everything in my head for new words and grammatical constructs and it seemed to help. When I saw people running it was &quot;die laufen&quot; not because I had to think about running and then translate it, it was just thats what it was. One thing I didn&#x27;t do much of was learn grammar I found it terribly boring and just learned whatever people on the radio said that I didn&#x27;t understand.<p>I also spoke a ton with native speakers my then girlfriend being one, but in the very beginning I remember that talking with native speakers was very difficult.<p>What helped a lot in this regard was having a friend who also wasn&#x27;t a native speaker, we could both easily communicate with each other in German, we didn&#x27;t use slang and didn&#x27;t speak very fast, but it helped us get used to it, we&#x27;d talk about new words we learned and never spoke in anything besides German. After about 6 months of serious hardcore learning we were both able to carry on fluent conversations with Germans to the point where we didn&#x27;t annoy them by being too slow and dumb. It was also around this time that things started getting enjoyable, before that it was all work and zero fun, just straining your brain to internalize grammatical rules and meanings of word sounds. After that most improvement just came through reading and learning written formulations since the everyday word-set was more or less mastered, which is another benefit of just learning to speak/understand - the language itself becomes a whole lot smaller.<p>Finally, much later I tried to learn Polish and spent about a month on it before giving up because I couldn&#x27;t motivate myself enough to go through those grueling months again. One thing I remember thinking with Polish, which probably applies to Russian as well is that it would take longer than German did to get to that same level where you start enjoying things. The grammar was extremely difficult and its phonetical system and vocabulary much more different than the western european languages I already spoke.<p>So in summary, my advice would be the following:<p>1. Make sure you are really motivated and dedicated to learning it - it sounds like you are :). It will become fun and a really amazing thing that you can read literature and enjoy movies and a completely different culture than your own, but in the beginning its just a lot of hard work so make sure you have the internal motivation to carry you through the rough waters at the beginning.<p>2. Once you can carry even a broken conversation find someone who&#x27;s at or slightly above your level that you can talk with and don&#x27;t fallback to some other language, make yourself use Russian.<p>3. When you are comfortable communicating without long pauses to think about what word you want to say, find native speakers you can talk with.<p>4. Listen, listen, listen - radio is the best. You have to concentrate on sounds and their meanings to know whats going on and your brain isn&#x27;t dumbed into just understanding the visuals like tv or movies do. Also music, especially rap is good if you can find songs you can rap along to and you memorize the words and their meanings as well.<p>5. Learn any grammar you need to, but don&#x27;t overdo it. You&#x27;ll have time later to go into the nitty gritty and all the written language literary constructs.<p>Best of luck",1431613865

So students being able to pass tests is at the root of &quot;Communicating Mastery&quot; whereas mastery itself would be the ability to do the job in &quot;real life&quot;<p>Even in my own personal life, I often reach a point where I&#x27;m internally better at a subject than I can express it even in a natural setting.  So I do think there is still a concept of internal mastery and that it does have use for self reflection.<p>Most often this is when debugging some complex application and getting an intuition as to where the application is broken.  It still takes more time before I can express my mastery of the issue in the form of a fix and in some cases even more time before I can give a sufficient justification for why the fix works.<p>Recently I fixed on issue by applying a sort to a list being traversed by a function calculating something off of it.  It was weeks later before I figured out why the sort was actually needed (when working on a related issue), there was just an intuition that the list needed to be sorted.<p>>The real problem at this point is not how a specific test is run, but rather that our education systems has trained students to think inside a very small box when taking tests, and students become often paralyzed with indecision when asked to act outside that box. Most of my students have never experienced socratic method, and are honestly scared of it.<p>Yep.

Technically, using forms and very basic CSS results in a fairly usable service. I managed to get a working CSS3-only (no JS) fallback for tabs, some toggle buttons and some other UI goodies. The only problem is that I end up duplicating a lot of stuff on the backend of the app (because I have to deal with both form submissions AND ajax), and there are a lot of things that you can only really do with JavaScript and images (e.g. games, most interactive stuff without reloads, anything to do with images obviously).<p>EDIT: regarding advertising, rarely do (effective) advertisers online want the <i>largest</i> audience specifically, they want the most engaged audience. Is this no-JS and no-images user interested in downloading an app or a pop album?

Each manifold is just a collection of points that can be locally mapped to some coordinate system. Furthermore, distances between points can be characterized by a given metric and paths across these points define tangent spaces of valid directional derivatives.<p>But that&#x27;s not as important as the idea that the points composing the manifolds in question represent distinct probability distributions. For example, 2D surface could be made that represents all normal distributions. One dimension is the 1st parameter (mean over all reals) and the second is the 2nd parameter (variance over pos reals).<p>This let&#x27;s you think about quantifiably describing the differences between probability distributions of a given parameterization.

9545211,comment,9543299,9543902,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"I was in a similar situation a few years ago, before the 2008 housing bubble crash.  I grew up in a beachside Florida town, where the prices had literally never gone down since the founding of the town. I was worried that I would never be able to buy here. I was really worried that what looked like a bubble in 2003-2007 was going to turn out to be permanent, and lock me out of owning in my hometown forever. I felt stupid for not buying into the rapidly rising prices as early as possible. But I worried and waited, and rented and saved.<p>It turned out I was correct to do so. The housing market crashed and I was able to pick up a large house in a great neighborhood for $200k. The two things that really convinced me that the real estate bubble was indeed a bubble were these: a) I had friends who were able to make a better living flipping houses than I did as an industrial physicist, and b) the rental rates were not growing nearly as fast as the housing prices were, which indicated that all those houses bought as investments were unlikely to pan-out as good investments long-term.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about the Toronto market. But I&#x27;d recommend keeping an eye on the difference between growth in rental prices and growth in property prices.  They are rarely the same.  Yes, foreigners are willing to take some losses to keep their money safely out of their home country, so the situation isn&#x27;t the same as in 2007.  However, the purpose of their investment is to keep their money safe, and so like all bubbles, when the prices start to fall there will be a rush to another safer asset class.<p>So, you probably aren&#x27;t screwed long term, just short term.  If you see the bubble, so does (almost) everyone else.  You can buy and try to time the market if you want risky returns.  Or you can rent a house for now and then buy a nicer one after the crash if you want to just get a good deal on housing for your money.",1431612485

We don&#x27;t have to make the massive cognitive leaps that children do—we&#x27;ve already done that. This is what all the emphasis on grammar exercises is about: trying to supercharge our language learning ability. But it has to be built on a foundation of interaction, comprehensive input, and effective communication.<p>Learning a language to near-native fluency levels is a years- or decades-long process, and most people will stop at a level that they find &quot;good enough&quot; and let their second language fossilize. And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, it probably is indeed good enough!<p>It&#x27;s a question of continually finding new motivations, and motivation over a long period of time, of setting new goals, and especially establishing an identity as a person who speaks that language. Just have fun, keep it interesting, engage in it constantly (or intensively). You&#x27;ll be more likely to keep at it if you enjoy it and don&#x27;t look at it as &quot;miles of crawling through the shit&quot;.",1431612419

And this doesn&#x27;t say anything about which place is harder to study or to get respectable results; obviously people&#x27;s expectations rise with the inflation. But there <i>is</i> a downside to inflation though, namely that it is easier to get straight As, which means that you can&#x27;t differentiate the academically gifted from the academically brilliant. Not unless you bring in other metrics, but I guess having other metrics is healthy according to some opinions.<p>Life is probably less <i>winner takes all</i> over here, but I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with grade inflation or lack thereof in high school or college.<p>For that matter; where you are accepted into higher education over here tends to be determined by a <i>score</i> which is your average grade plus some points for age (maybe for &quot;life experience&quot;?), and other things. Which ends up meaning that if you don&#x27;t have near perfect grades out of &quot;high school&quot;, you won&#x27;t get into medical school (I guess this is the hardest one to get into).

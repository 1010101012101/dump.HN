2094869,comment,2094615,2094791,0,0,pedanticfreak,,,"I want to echo that the AT&T iPhone is hugely disappointing when traveling internationally due to the outrageous cost of AT&T's roaming plans. Data is prohibitively expensive. Think $1 per megabyte (not a typo, mega-byte). That's $200 for 200 MB or $2,000 for 2 GB. Voice calls are usually $1 per minute. You're pretty much stuck with a very pretty machine that sends $0.50 text messages.<p>Even if you get an unlocked phone, you will most likely only be able to get a voice+text SIM card when traveling. Especially in Europe, only full blown plans included any amount of data. And every damn country requires a new SIM. Absolutely painful and honestly not that valuable. You might just gain ever so slightly cheaper calls and texts to local phones, and absolutely nothing if you want to call back home.<p>Verizon Global phones, on the other hand, are amazing. AMAZING! You pay $80 per month for unlimited data. Yes, UNLIMITED international data. And Verizon will prorate your fees for only the days that you travel and also discount you the cost of your existing data plan during these days. Otherwise it is the same as AT&T, but this is a HUGE difference.<p>If you travel and want to use data then Verizon is the way to go. You just need a Global phone, and unfortunately the iPhone isn't one of them.",1294804672

It seems here that keeping H.264 support and dropping Flash would be more in the name of openness.<p>(Edit: bane points out that you can <i>disable</i> Flash in Chrome. My original point still stands, but my wording was misleading.)<p>As with most things Google does, I don't see this as being in the interest of 'openness' at all. I feel more like what they really want is a format that they can control and add features to (such as, for example, embedded advertising).<p>In the end, Google is a business, and its business is ads. Everything Google does is about either delivering ads to people (Google Mail), making sure it's their ads that are delivered (YouTube), or about making sure they don't get locked out of a market (Android).<p>So here's my question: where's the money here? It's obviously far more expensive at this point to use WebM than H.264, so what financial motivation is there for them to push the WebM codec this hard this fast?",1294804230

If an early prospect for your new product is focused more on the outcome than on managing the transition your team had better be good at managing the introduction and bringup of your offering or the prospect may lose heart.<p>Early adopters often find a startup before the startup can find them.

MPEG-LA made the same vague threats about patent pools against Vorbis, but they never followed through.<p>Xiph.org conducted a patent search early in the Vorbis process, and believes Vorbis does not infringe on any patents.

While valid, I think it illustrates the effect of the unhappiness problem rather than the underlying cause.<p>I call the root of the problem The SimCity Effect.<p>The SimCity Effect -- as I describe it -- is essentially a real life application of the economic principle of diminishing marginal value, i.e., the more of a given good you gain, the less value you gain from each subsequent good.<p>I think wealthy peoples' unhappiness with life is due to the far greater decrease in value -- or utility -- they gain each time they move up the ladder than those with lesser means.<p>This is in turn is caused by a fundamental failure by most people to have a predetermined sense of ""satisfaction"" or ""accomplishment"" in life. This is where the SimCity analogy comes to play.<p>Those of you who grew up playing SimCity probably experienced this phenomenon: you start building a city, eagerly growing larger and larger, with more and better public utilities, education, etc., and your satisfaction curve probably faced an initial upward curve: all things being equal, the goal of SimCity was arguably to build the largest, cleanest, most educated, and high tech city you could manage.<p>Trouble is, that's a pretty vague goal: what does ""large"" mean? 1M people? 2M? 10M? In the absence of a clear and defined goal, and no way to ""win"" the game in the traditional sense, most SimCity builders suffered a very real sense of diminishing marginal value, and thus their satisfaction -- joy with the game, etc. -- decreased as well.<p>This is not to say that one should set finite goals beyond which we should strive no further, but rather that we should at least set a mental note alerting us to when, in our life, we have obtained our goals, so we can at least breathe a sigh of relief and say ""I've done it."" Anything beyond that would be a bonus and it would essentially reset our internal ""utility"" curve accordingly to, perhaps, begin anew. This would certainly explain serial entrepreneurs and the like.<p>This to me is the real problem with happiness -- or lack thereof -- at the highest echelon of society: it is not unhappiness per se, but rather a lack of satisfaction due to what can be best described as satisfaction desensitization.<p>Just my 2c.",1294803539

Chained CPI != inflation since the basket of goods changes with time. To measure inflation, you need to measure the cost of the 1970's basket of goods in 2010 dollars. Modern medicine, cell phones, computers, HDTVs, etc must all be excluded. CPI doesn't do this.<p>Further, even taking chained CPI as a measure of inflation, it's known to overestimate inflation by about 1.3% at least until 1996 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boskin_Commission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boskin_Commission</a>). Taking Boskin-corrected CPI as a measure of inflation, wages have increased 40% over 40 years.",1294801299

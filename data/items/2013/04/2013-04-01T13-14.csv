As I understand it the reason for this is battery life: these battery chemistries last much longer when only in a partially charged state.<p>I think that Tesla is pushing this: a quick Google suggests they may be charging up to 95% and maybe dropping to 5% in their standard packs.  40kWH usable charge on a 60kWh pack brings this down to maybe 65%, which should last a good long time.",1364824348

If you don't have a Steam account but still want to check it out, feel free to take a look at my profile: <a href=""http://mysteamgauge.com/search?username=monkeyagent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysteamgauge.com/search?username=monkeyagent</a><p>Here's the summary I posted over on the Steam forums:<p>What it is:<p>Steam Gauge will let you get a summary of all the games/apps/etc listed for your Steam account via the Steam Web API. It returns information about those games including hard drive space requirements and cost (base store value, not what you actually paid).<p>Features:<p>-The list that is constructed allows you to individually select/de-select apps.<p>-There is a graphical representation of collection percentage selected vs total.<p>-There are pre-built options to select only a given app type (game, app, movie, etc).<p>-The app table allows you to sort the list by title, id number, hard drive space, type, and cost (just click the headers).<p>-If you don't have a vanity username set up, you can use your steamID64 number instead.<p>-If game information is missing from the database, it automatically adds that id to the list of apps to update in the next database refresh (simply using Steam Gauge helps make it better).<p>-Finally, you can export the results of Steam Gauge to a csv file, so you can manipulate the data however you wish.<p>Requirements:<p>-For now, your profile needs to be public.<p>-Javascript must be enabled on the browser.<p>-If you use a relatively modern browser, the whole experience is going to look/work better.<p>Limitations:<p>-The hard drive values are based primarily on the published requirements (where available) and is otherwise based on manual data checks of game install size.<p>-The database still isn't complete, especially for new games, and weird exceptions. It should still be helpful for general estimates, but the precision is limited to the data available.<p>-The mobile layout still needs a little work but should function properly.<p>-The ""Value"" column represents the base cost of the game, not what an account owner <i>paid</i>.<p>Future plans:<p>-Add more game information including genres, controller support and multi-player capabilities<p>-Add submission flag for games with missing/incorrect data to help crowdsource what I can't scrape",1364824186

It is impossible to squeeze a good solution into a short timeframe.""<p>This is the most common Agile failure mode I've seen. You have to finish by the end of the iteration, so you're very heavily biased toward ugly hacks and Rube Goldberg machine coding. Elegance never fits in a sprint.<p>The last total Agile Kool-Aid drinker company I worked for also coincidentally had the most massive shit heap of code I have ever seen in production. It was a heterogenous mix of VB.NET, Ruby, Java, shell scripts, and Python running on Linux and Windows (and a bit of Mono on Linux), all glued together with duct tape and chewing gum. The Scrum Master was really proud of it, called it a Service Oriented Architecture. He could make pretty charts of it that made it look good, but if you lifted the hood it looked like garbage and required at least 10X the Amazon EC2 footprint it should have required. It was probably also a security nightmare, and was definitely hell to maintain.<p>That experience really destroyed my interest in Agile, since I could see very clearly how the problem was emergent from Agile's short sprint and exclusively deliverable-focused structure. The programmers were actually decent coders, and it wasn't really their fault. (Except maybe the heterogeneity...)",1364823983
5472950,comment,5467225,5472871,3,0,dctoedt,,,"> <i>What is the actual effect of SCOTUS setting aside as unconstitutional duly passed acts of Congress?</i><p>That's like asking, what is the actual effect of a thunderstorm.  The answer is, it depends.<p>At a minimum, if a government official were to attempt to enforce a law after it had been declared unconstitutional, almost certainly someone would challenge the enforcement attempt in a lower court. (If no one cared, the law wouldn't have ended up in the Supreme Court in the first place.)<p>The challenge usually will lead to the lower court's issuance of an injunction prohibiting the government official from continuing with his or her attempt to enforce the law.  Disobedience of the injunction is punishable as contempt -- as in, the U.S. Marshals will arrest and jail the disobedient official until the contempt is purged.  (I don't have time to go into the details of the contempt process.)  I can't remember that ever happening, because the Court's power to declare a statute unconstitutional is essentially universally accepted as a practical matter, even though some theorists challenge it from time to time.<p>Sometimes the Court rules that the unenforceability is retroactive; this can create practical problems, but institutionally the Court is fully aware of that and takes it into account.<p>Other times the Court will say that the unenforceability is prospective only, that is, existing actions aren't to be disturbed.<p>Incidentally, the article by Pickerill (not Pickerell) that you cite doesn't support your view.  The article lists the various ways in which Congress has <i>deferred</i> to the Court's rulings, that is, acceded to the Court's authority.  For example, Congress might amend an unconstitutional statute to fix the constitutionality problems, or it might repeal the statute entirely.",1364823962

Some of the people in the modding scene have absolutely awesome skills, on par with the best in the industry (and since they're working their way backwards from the designs in some ways more impressive).<p>All software has bugs, indeed, including the software that your vehicle came with in the first place.<p>If you mess with the charge curves on your batteries then you'll likely reap what you sow (I'd stay the hell away from there), but if it does overheat or explodes that will be <i>just</i> the same overheating or explosion that you could expect in a regular accident. Likely your EV has been designed around such failures, if it hasn't then you're in trouble even if you don't mod it.<p>If the brakes stop working then you're in trouble (and so is everybody within striking distance), but brakes failing due to a software bug that you induced is a thing that I've yet to come across. Most brake systems have mechanical back-up, and if all that fails you can still reach for the 'oh-shit' lever, aka the emergency brake. Anybody that has ever had a master cylinder fail on them knows what I mean.<p>Insurance companies deal in statistics. If you register your vehicle by brand and type then they'll quote you a value. If you plan on doing experiments with the drive train, if you increase the stock power by more than 20%, if you start messing with the structural components of the car (which I think is <i>far</i> scarier than any software mod) then there are procedures on how to deal with that. In some countries insurance companies will insure anything that moves, in others you need to go through a complex formalized procedure that tries to ascertain whether or not your car is fit for the road.<p>As with everything you mess with: know what you are doing and err on the side of caution, especially when lives are involved. But don't let that stop you from learning skills and applying those skills to real world hardware. After all, if everybody would stick to theory we'd never have a lot of nice things.",1364822809

He was a pioneer, at least in Web terms, of promoting the kind of data-based decision making that many successful Internet businesses take for granted today. Anyone who designs web sites but hasn't read early Nielsen is missing out, IMHO.<p>However, as time passed, his articles became increasingly self-referential and self-promotional, and seemed to include less and less substantial, original content. <i>By his own arguments</i> his material was becoming worse.<p>His old site famously wasn't a shining beacon of graphic design, and he always seemed rather proud of that -- ironically, really, with the body of research we now have that shows how much influence a good visual design can have on readability. With the redesign used since the move to the NN Group site, he seems to have completely jumped the shark. Even famous Nielsen material on the F-shaped reading pattern and the use of underlining for hyperlinks seems to have been discarded. The text is set in a small size and with a font stack that will render unpleasantly on a significant number of visitors' computers (because Helvetica is often installed on Windows PCs, but only as a cheap and nasty screen version of a printer font). And what happened to not making real content look like an advert?!<p>It really is a shame, because every now and then he does still write a great article.

If a federal action can, e.g., be justified by any other clause in the Constitution, it is by definition one of the powers that have been ceded.<p>There has also been no real expansion of the Commerce Clause (Wickard aside--which is best understood as a World War II case). The definition of the Commerce Power post-Lopez is more or less the same as it was defined in Gibbons v. Ogden in 1824. What's changed is the nature of the economy.<p>> America's defining characteristic from 1776 to 1860 or so was extraordinarily low levels of government intervention<p>America's defining characteristic from 1776 to 1860 was extraordinarily low levels of commercial activity that affected any significant number of people. The vast majority of the country was engaged in agrarian activities--what economists would today call the ""household economy."" What commercial activity that did exist was regulated. Trade via navigable waterways and international trade were the major types of commercial activity that existed, and they were regulated by the federal government from the beginning. Joint stock companies were charted and regulated by the states from before the time of the founding.<p>The government (between the federal and state governments), taxed what was important at the time: land, international trade, trade in various goods people couldn't make for themselves: sugar, etc.<p>> You do also realize that there wasn't even an income tax till 1913<p>You also realize that the income tax as it's currently defined wouldn't even reach most of the economic activity that existed in early America? Income taxes reach market transactions, but before industrialization people didn't depend solely on the market for their daily necessities like we do today. Even today, to the extent that production and consumption happen within a household, no ""income"" accrues to be taxed. What's happened isn't so much that th<p>> Can the SEC be trusted to regulate itself?<p>It doesn't have to be. It's a federal agency, answerable to elected officials.<p>> You do know what career status is, right?<p>Do you know what career status is? It allows you to re-enter federal service without taking the necessary civil service exams, and allows you to apply for internal job openings even if you're not currently working with the government. It doesn't do any of the things you claim it does.<p>> We can trust the SEC to harass Bitcoin, Paypal, and startups. We can also trust the SEC to be bribed or captured out of regulating the financial markets.<p>The SEC, like most agencies, exists as a conservative force. They want to preserve the status quo until new things have proven themselves. This is not a bad thing.<p>> Given the events of the last five years, it is only extraordinary ignorance or chutzpah that could lead someone to claim that the SEC protects investors.<p>It's incredible how people who hold fringe minority viewpoints can convince themselves that everyone else is either ignorant or lying.<p>> No. This is just a rehash of the conventional wisdom. Without FDRs regulatory state we would ostensibly be victims of those evil businesses, as we are incapable of judging product quality on our own.<p>Information asymmetries, negative externalities, etc, aren't just things I made up. They're real economic concepts and are the reason regulatory states exist. I don't feel compelled to argue with you on positions supported by the large majority of economists in the field.<p>> Only someone who either (a) profits from the complexity of the regulatory state or (b) is completely unfamiliar with its workings could fail to be appalled by the level of corruption and incompetence that is its defining characteristic.<p>I got news for you: we all profit from the existence of the regulatory state. My father left a country that had no regulation. It was a libertarian paradise! Get yourself out in the rural areas and pretty much everyone will leave you alone. It sucked. I challenge you to go live in one of these places that has little to no regulation. If you can't find one that is that way but also has an acceptably high standard of living for someone coming from the states, I'll assert that it's not a coincidence.",1364822007

This is why classes can contain methods. I don't know if you think that feature is also ""wrong"" in an OO language, but without it some of the primary benefits of OO, such as polymorphism, begin to disappear.<p>Speaking of polymorphism, how do you propose that would be achieved under the constraints you would impose? Prior to editing the parent, you had written that you prefer something like:<p>Connection conn = Connection( params )<p>instead of<p>Connection conn = new ConnectionManager().getConnection( params )<p>In that case, how would you propose that the former code (i.e. your preferred approach) instantiate the appropriate Connection subclass? There wasn't even a new operator or valid construction syntax in your preferred approach, so perhaps you recognized this limitation and were suggesting some magic would occur.<p>Before editing, you also said not to ""get you started on statics"". So, without statics, you couldn't even do something like Connection.getInstance(params) to allow the Connection class to determine which subclass to create. So, the calling code would have to be aware of which subclass to instantiate, which would be simply awful.<p>Perhaps this is why you edited your comment.<p>But leaving your edits aside, you still seem to think of objects as only data or structs with no behaviors, which is an extremely limiting constraint on OO design. In fact, it would eliminate so many benefits of OO programming that it wouldn't be OO at all.",1364821676

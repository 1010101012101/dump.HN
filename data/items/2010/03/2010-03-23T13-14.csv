You'll be able to get insurance after your get cancer come 2014. The exceptions are the ones involving car wrecks, falls, etc, where you don't have time to fill out paperwork before racking up a huge bill. Even those can do no worse than bankrupt you, and immortal 25 year olds are usually also broke 25 year olds.</i><p>Not true.  First of all most of the things I mentioned were fast accidents that gave you no warning.  So your most is wrong.  But it gets worse than that.  I listed no less than 4 people with cancer.  Let's go through them and see what difference insurance made.<p>Mark woke up, was not feeling well, then wound up in the ER that night.  Without insurance his family would have been financially hosed.  (He wound up dead within a year anyways.)<p>Euna brought up stomach trouble at a routine doctor's visit, the doctor followed up, discovered an aggressive cancer at a fairly early stage.  (This was incredibly lucky for her, if the cancer had been located a few inches farther away there would have been no symptoms at all.)  Without insurance she would not have had a regular doctor's visit, would be less likely to catch it in time, and she'd have probably died.<p>The two with the brain cysts went to the doctor after developing severe balance problems.  Not having insurance would have meant living through that while going through several weeks of paperwork.  What is worse the condition they both had is one where if you stand up and bend over you can drop dead instantly.  So without insurance a few nasty weeks with instant death quite likely.<p>So the likely cost for the cancer cases if you didn't have insurance?  Instant bankruptcy, likely death, possible death, and possible death.<p>Now that may be bad luck, but those are just a list of people who came to mind for me in a few minutes of thinking.  YMMV but that is not a risk I particularly desire to go through.",1269351981

1212865,comment,1211938,1211938,0,0,Tycho,,,"My biggest complaint about programming education and text-books is the handling of the 'object-oriented' issue. They throw it at you, at the very start, with zero context. I asked my lecturer what 'non-object-oriented' programming would be, and he couldn't give me a straight answer. A fellow student turned and said 'it's like when you don't have buttons, just prompts' (with an implied 'd'uh!'). It seemed he was confusing the OO paradigm with the 'visual' programming/design paradigm. Another problem is when they teach about encapsulation, they put far too much emphasis on defensive programming and make it sound like there's hackers out to meddle with your classes or grossly negligent colleagues who MUST NEVER see your code; whereas it seems to me the main benefit is 'information hiding' for the purpose of focusing control/interfacing into single points thereby making changes easier (eg. you could have any number of possible mechanisms behind a clock-face but the face remains always familiar to the outside world).<p>Of course, these are just my opinions as a relative n00b. :)",1269351807

Apple has a pretty clear design aesthetic for OS X that they carry through to a lot of the applications they write as well.  That's given the developer/designer community a great base to start from. A lot of the 3rd party applications are tweaks of the general aesthetic that Apple provides to start with and they end up looking great. I don't mean to imply that the people creating OS X applications aren't talented, but Apple has sure helped them by providing a solid foundation. As a developer I can go into Xcode and put together and easily put together an interface that looks both very modern and well designed (whitespace, colors, etc).<p>Contrast that with Windows (I do most of my coding on Windows) where the application development tools let you easily create what is pretty much a Windows 95 style application. If I want to do something more modern looking, I certainly can, but I will be on my own to basically override existing controls to come up with my own look and feel.  Also, I will be creating this look and feel from scratch as Microsoft has provided no starting point.<p>Microsoft theoretically has provided the tools to create great looking resolution independent applications with WPF, but until they start providing some examples of what the Windows aesthetic really is through their own applications, you won't see many great looking applications on Windows.",1269350716

The net result is the following set of expectations: you teach them how to apply an algorithm, then they repeat what you told them on the test. This is nothing more than ""teaching to the test"".<p>This is, for the most part, how students are taught in high school.<p>The problem is the following: real life and (if you are doing your job right) more advanced classes don't fit this model. A simple linear algebra example (from my midterm two weeks ago) illustrates what happens when students are taught this way.<p>Problem: <i>a 4k x 4k matrix M consists of 4x4 blocks along the diagonal, 4x4 blocks on the bottom row, and zeros elsewhere. Find an</i> efficient <i>algorithm for computing M v (v a vector).</i><p><pre><code>    [ M1 0  0 ... 0 ]
    [ 0  M2 0 ... 0 ]
    [ ...           ]
    [ B1 B2 ...   Bk]
</code></pre>
The right answer consists of multiplying only the non-zero blocks and has complexity O(k). I gave partial credit for any answer that computed M v. The most common answer I got was ""compute the LU factorization."" Some went so far as to explain how to use the LU factorization to <i>solve</i> Mx = v. Apparently, I used the word ""efficient"" when explaining the purpose of the LU factorization, and I used the word ""efficient"" in this problem.<p>My students were trained for 12 years to repeat the teachers password. This training failed them the moment they needed to think. It may improve performance in the short term, and it's an easy way to teach. But the long term results are extremely harmful.",1269350506

If it has had bad consequences, they weren't doing it right.<p>This is a good point, but it appears like the process of attempting to apply consequentialist thinking almost always leads to bad places. Consider, for example, Prohibition or the War on Drugs. These were both really well-intentioned in some ways - they were about having a cleaner, more sober, more healthy society, with less poverty and more prosperity, and less addiction. But the end result is creating an underground drug/alcohol trade, giving rise to organized crime and gangs, and having people now consume less safe homebrewed versions of alcohol and drugs.<p>I think most if not all well-intentioned consequentialist thinking goes to similar places. There were will always be seductively alluring ""Works in theory/destroys the world"" type things (separate but equal segregation, communism, prohibition, price controls) - and many of those are in violation of basic deontological ethics of giving people choice, letting them live their lives, and so on. I think the vast majority of drastically bad ideas can be avoided with straightforward, rule based live and let live type ethics, which is what I personally favor after searching around.<p>""Ends justify the means"" has historically always led to bad places - and I think it always will.

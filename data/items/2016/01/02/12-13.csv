Elected officials can&#x27;t be trusted to decide what&#x27;s &#x27;right&#x27; for me to consume or not to consume.</i><p>I agree that their agendas are often problematic, but then again people can&#x27;t exactly be trusted to decide what&#x27;s good for them either. Regulating food may be too much, but check out things like e.g. vaccines, effectiveness of which depends on <i>everyone</i> who can taking them, whether they like it or not. For the most prominent examples of people who absolutely should not be let to decide what they can or cannot do, see <i>drivers</i>. The flippant attitude to traffic laws is what causes lots of unnecessary deaths and injuries, as well as economic losses in unnecessary traffic jams.<p>> <i>If it costs &#x27;society&#x27; more, then charge people for the actual cost at the time the cost is incurred.</i><p>It&#x27;s complicated. Sometimes charging at the point of purchase is exactly the right way. For instance, taxing fuel is a good idea, because it&#x27;s directly related to the environmental damage it causes. A CO₂ emission tax would be a great way to internalize the cost of externalities, have the price reflect the true costs for everyone.<p>Other times, it may be a choice between what&#x27;s &quot;most free&quot; and what&#x27;s most effective. You&#x27;re right that as a responsible person you should not be punished for irresponsible actions of the few. It seems fair to put the cost of e.g. alcoholism on the people who actually suffer from it. But I&#x27;d argue that in practice, it&#x27;s too late. The goal should not be to wait for the irresponsible people to get in trouble, but to prevent them from it in the first place. Prevention is more effective than a cure; not to mention that there&#x27;s no point in charging an alcoholic extra for treating liver failure - they won&#x27;t be able to pay it anyway.<p>By the way, how is the society supposed to know that <i>you</i> are the responsible person and you won&#x27;t become an alcoholic? It can&#x27;t. Some people become alcoholics every year and others don&#x27;t, but we can&#x27;t tell beforehand who will be in which group. So the simple approach will be probabilistic - assuming that everyone has the expected-number-of-alcoholics/total-alcohol-consumers probability of becoming one, and taxing this fraction of the costs out of everyone. Where to best put that tax? On alcohol purchase directly; that way you fairly exclude people who don&#x27;t drink at all, and thus will never cause costs to other people because of an alcohol problem. Could we make it &quot;more fair&quot;? Probably, by means of making it more complicated. But complicated means overhead and inefficiency, which is something you want to limit too.<p>Finally, I disagree with the idea that the government has no business telling you what you can or cannot do. I get that it has to be limited as much as possible for citizens to be happy, but in the end, bossing people around is the <i>sole and only reason</i> we have a government. It&#x27;s their raison d&#x27;être. Solving coordination problems and seeking globally optimal outcomes involves infringing on peoples&#x27; individual freedoms - or to turn it around, living in a society involves giving up some of individual freedoms. It&#x27;s the so-called social contract.",1451739597

Language hobbyists wishing to keep it in a working state.<p>Besides that there is little reason to use Dylan, nowadays.<p>(But see BruceM&#x27;s comment about using this Dylan as a foundation for further development.)<p>It was once developed by Apple to replace Object Pascal and C++ for application and also systems development. But with NeXT bought by Apple that was the role of Objective C and many years later now also for Swift.<p>This particular version of Dylan was developed by Harlequin - the product name was DylanWorks. Harlequin was bought by Globalgraphics. Globalgraphics used the Postscript raster image processor developed by Harlequin and spun off the LispWorks system into its own company. Years later DylanWorks and even later MLWorks were open sourced. One idea of Harlequin was to develop a range of modern programming languages, implementations for those and development environments: Postscript, Common Lisp, Dylan, ML, ...  The implementations were closed source and proprietary. When Apple announced their Dylan, Harlequin hoped to follow a market leader by providing an implementation for platforms Apple would not cover: Unix, Windows, ... Also Harlequin might have hoped to use their Dylan themselves for development of software applications.<p>But Harlequin in this forms does not exist anymore, DylanWorks has been open sourced and Apple has long ago lost interest in Dylan.<p>On the positive side: this Dylan is free and open source and interested persons can study and, maybe, use it.<p>Lisp users might be interested to study the prototyped implementation of Dylan for LispWorks. This implementation was not their shipped product, though.<p><a href=""https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/tree/5f9225d246d771cfaa2fa4f255a4447bff6991b8/old/Sources/emulator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/tree/5f9225d246d771c...</a><p>That particular version is another example of a non-trivial programming language built in Lisp - especially given that it also has a non Lisp-like syntax.",1451739557

10826040,comment,10822747,10825860,0,0,gnufied,,,"So, leaving aside the fanaticism around number of lines a functions should have which I disagree with, there are some big advantages of splitting a functions in logical units.<p>1. If you have ever written unit test for 300 line function you know it gets dicey. Such a function will likely require too much setup and will require complex mocks/patches/doubles to be unit tested.<p>2. As I mentioned before, I don&#x27;t believe in number of lines thingy but logical unit of separation. If a function, opens a file, reads & parses config data from it, reads URL from the config data , parses http response and writes updated bits to config data - these distinct things can be logically separated and will be easier to unit test perhaps (again production scenario might be more complicated). Also, with modern IDEs and editors jumping back&forth between functions should be a breeze and your IDE/editor should provide an outline of file which can be scanned quickly.<p>3. If you have written a long function that does too many logical things(not again by number of lines) - next person who makes changes to it, isn&#x27;t going to break it up - even if breaking up makes sense. For example, lets say in above example original code was written with expectation of certain format of config data but now somehow the function has to support more than one config data. Now the code is so tightly coupled that - it is harder to break out parser of this new format to new function and hence the function will keep growing (and did I mention the unit test setup has to support new config format as well somehow).<p>3. If however, lets say method computes moving average of a timeseries, it probably makes sense to have it all in one function even if it becomes slightly longer.<p>TL;DR - Cargo culting must be avoided at all costs, however we don&#x27;t need to throw the baby with the water. Each problem calls for our own judgement. Separate the functions by logical units, rather than number of lines, use proper editor/IDE.",1451738930

One of them couldn&#x27;t learn the language using the above approach, the other forced himself to do it with great results. And by that, I mean no subtitles, no dictionary (or at least very rarely).<p>So how to get from 0 to 24?. I&#x27;m really no scientist, but I think of it as the same way a baby would learn a language. you get yourself in an environment where you try to submerge yourself into the language. The &quot;mum&quot; here should be something you really love, for example a TV show or a movie or a radio show. The other ingredient would be to get the basics of the new language first in term of grammar and words. I would say a few hundred words that are important would suffice at the beginning.\nThe trick is not to learn word by word, but rather sentences (I think of them as the algorithm of each language). Subtitles for me at least seem to hinder the brain of connecting speech, facial expressions, feelings, images etc and blending everything in a perfect place for the brain to remember.\nAn example: In German &quot;Gift&quot; means poison in English. However, As a native English speaker your brain is wired to think of it as something positive, because all of the memories you had when you received a gift. So instead of translating it, remember it in the original language with original memories/images/sentences.<p>Try also to read a lot of pop culture magazines. This is really important because it helps you understand slang, inside jokes..etc. An example:\nWould you be able to understand a joke about Bill Cosby/ Justin Bieber if you didn&#x27;t read those pop culture magazine?<p>Finally, your speaking need practicing by talking to native speaker and going to meetups/get tog ether&#x27;s to practice.<p>Once you get the above, just have a little faith that it will click. Keep watching/listening and you will at the end understand what the &quot;mum&quot; is saying :).<p>Edit: This method is based on Images and Emotions which scientifically have a bigger impact on us than just words.\nCan&#x27;t find a link to an actual study though.<p>Hope this helps.",1451737307

10825939,comment,10825575,10825813,0,0,_yosefk,,,"I dunno. There are two kinds of such books - those published before the ascension to power and those published afterwards (the Little Red Book is one example of the latter.) Only books of the first kind might have contributed to the author&#x27;s rise to power, but it&#x27;s hard to tell how much, and at least intuitively it doesn&#x27;t seem like any of the leaders you mentioned rose to power mainly due to their writing ability.<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting to read the writings of an influential person, and sometimes it is mandatory to read them even if it&#x27;s not that interesting, but I doubt that these people mainly become influential through their writing (at least the effect seems much smaller than the reverse - books becoming widely read because of the author&#x27;s influence on world events.) It certainly works in both directions, I just think one is much stronger than the other.<p>The pen and the sword... well, persuasion is mightier than an individual&#x27;s brute force because you can mobilize the force of others through persuasion. But is &quot;pen&quot; the right metaphor for persuasion in a world where both dictators and democratically elected leaders rely on the support of huge groups of people, many of whom rarely read, have poor reading comprehension (don&#x27;t we all? especially when reading what we disagree with?), and are most easily swayed by simple ideas boiling down to &quot;the source of your troubles whom you should rob to improve your life is X&quot;? If the world is run a by a literate few born into a powerful minority, then perhaps a pen might be more powerful.<p>As to religious texts... I think they&#x27;re kinda different in that say Lenin&#x27;s writing could rival the popularity of religious texts <i>for a while</i>, at a time when printing was very cheap, but it no longer can. Contrast that to religious texts which remained popular for hundreds and thousands of years at a time when reproducing texts was very expensive. And there was never a lack of either tyrants or statesmen with popular support during those years, moreover, quite a few of those tyrants were worshiped as gods, and both tyrants and elected politicians wrote texts. None of these texts are remotely as widely read as religious texts.<p>So whatever the cause, the handful of popular prophets are vastly more popular than any of history&#x27;s politicians, and are way better at maintaining their influence from their graves.",1451736271

Creating a basic window with labeled buttons is a one-liner. Clearly all wasn&#x27;t perfect in REBOL-ville, as a burst of excitement in the late 1990s was tempered with a long period of inactivity, and some features of the language never quite lived up to their initial promises.<p>These days HTML is the most reasonable approach to anything involving fonts and images and interaction. It&#x27;s not as beautifully direct as REBOL, and being trapped in a browser is somewhere between limiting and annoying, but the visual toolkit is there, and it&#x27;s ubiquitous. (For the record, I would have solved the &quot;list all the filenames...&quot; problem by generating HTML, but firing up a browser to display the result is a heavy-handed solution.)&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/66.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/66.html</a> - <i>&quot;A handful of language designers have tried to make GUI programming as easy as traditional programming. The Tk library for TCL, which is still the foundation for Python&#x27;s out-of-the-box IDE, allows basic UI creation with simple, declarative statements. REBOL is a more recent incarnation of the same idea, that sample code involving windows and user input and graphics should be a handful of lines, not multiple pages of wxWindows fussing. I wish more people were working on such things.&quot;</i>",1451736030

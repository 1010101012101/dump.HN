The latency/throughput ratio for storage, networking, memory, cache and almost everything else has been rising continuously since the 70s and is likely to carry on rising.<p>This is going to have big consequences for the way that we design systems in the future. Transferring a large amount of data is going to be cheap and fast. Seeking, handshaking, back-and-forth and any other latency sensitive operations are going to be slow and expensive. This has already played a big role in algorithm design in HPC, and is going to start being felt to a much larger degree in the wider field over the next decade. As the latency/throughput ratio gets bigger, the tradeoffs behind optimal system design will change.<p>30ms for a Cray 1 was only 2400 clock cycles. 8ms for a modern CPU is around 30 million.

In either case, what I would tell him is that his percentage will be in rough proportion to his overall contribution to the project.  Lots of ideas are needed to design, create, market and sell an app.  Why should his one idea be favored above the others?  At best, one could weigh his idea in proportion to its usefulness toward the end-product.  He thinks he contributed 50% to the end product but why that number?  Why not 10%?  In any case, I don't think he should be paid anything until you recoup your fixed development costs.  What if the idea doesn't pan out?  It seems to me that he wants the risk-free part of supplying the ideas but wants you to go through the trouble and expense of building it.  Did he offer to pay you anything for the trouble?  I think most people would love to spend their days just dreaming up ideas and getting paid for other people implementing them.

Well obviously. No-one is saying slap any load of crap down and expect someone to pay for it.<p>The second is ""that deliver value"". This appears to be the one most missed by people, in my experience, and is the raison d'etre of MVP. If the market doesn't exist and if you aren't solving a genuine problem that you can both communicate and be delivered economically then it doesn't matter how much you ""think"".<p>This is why MVPs are important: an empirical guide to work out what should be done, not sitting at your desk pontificating with your wise-ass rationalisations, abstractions and reductions of human behaviour and reality.",1315393661

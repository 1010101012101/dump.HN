Your spouse should want that for you, and should be on board, no matter what the sacrifice. <p>It helps, though, to give something back for her dreams. Marriages are partnerships, after all. \n",1182267026

29228,comment,29108,29108,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Sounds like management has serious problems.<p>You never want key members of the team to have questions about whether their effort is going to be rewarded in the event of a nice liquidity event.  0.2% would be great if you're working for the next Google--but even Google gave away more then 0.2% to their first employee.  If it's not the next Google, think long and hard about how you're spending your time.  The only reason anyone, other than the founders, works for a startup is for the liquidity event (or a solid future of profit sharing if no such event is planned).  When we hire our first full-time employee we expect to offer them 1-5%, depending on their other compensation requirements and what they bring to the team.<p>Also, 12-14 hour days and seven day weeks are not productive over a sustained period, and they're a sign that the founders don't have a lot of real world experience.  It can work out, if everyone is just that passionate and feels like founding members of a great company, but I don't think 0.2% (vested over four years) would make me feel like a founding member.<p>I'd say get out...Not just because the carrot (0.2%) is much smaller than the stick (12-14 hour days), but because I'd lay good odds on this company failing fast.  From the small bits of data we have, I believe your companies management is incompetent.",1182266781

29223,comment,29108,29166,0,0,jmtame,,,"Well, the situation is this:<p>I was the first employee, and I came on board when the first round of angel investing was made.  There are currently 2 other employees, and 2 co-founders.  One is business-oriented, one technical.  I work probably a few hours less than the co-founder (per week).<p>The tech co-founder seems to be somewhat slow to pushing updates, as he gets sidetracked micro-managing the 3 team members (who are all graduates, except myself).  E-mails that come from investors are usually ignored, for the fear that they will ""distract the dev team.""  I'm not sure if that's normal either.<p>I'm new to joining startups, and don't understand investment and equity as well.  Obviously, I need to starting learning more ;)  That's one disadvantage of being as young as I am and joining a startup (I'm not old enough to buy a drink, let's put it that way).  I'm glad I got some feedback on this though..",1182265954

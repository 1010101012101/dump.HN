8471264,comment,8469802,8471015,0,0,TheCraiggers,,,"No, I think I understood your point, and the point of the second article. (Thanks for that, by the way, I wasn&#x27;t aware that Tesla had improved battery performance by keeping them warm. A neat idea.) I just didn&#x27;t write my response very well, and for that I apologize.<p>What I was referring to was mostly the amount of energy the climate control system uses. Heating the cabin is going to suck some juice. I&#x27;ve talked to Chevy Volt owners about their winter performance and they say heating is their biggest problem in the winter. Even with the gasoline engine running to provide some waste heat for the cabin, they still get 50% of their normal range if they turn the heat on. If they&#x27;re OK with driving to work wearing thick gloves and a winter parka while scraping the ice from the inside of their windshield, they only lose about 20% of their range which I presume is purely due to cold-weather battery performance at that point. Elon claims in the second article only 10% loss due to heating the cabin which frankly I don&#x27;t believe and am chalking up to &quot;MPG benchmarking nonsense.&quot; I admit I could be wrong, but I&#x27;d have to see some compelling numbers.<p>I believe my main point still stands though, which is that the government of Norway has built up the infrastructure and given people incentive to drive these cars. This doesn&#x27;t exist in Michigan. Chargemap.com says that there are 1,416 charging stations in Norway. According to energy.gov, Michigan has 700. Meanwhile, according to the population density map on Wikipedia (1994 was the newest I could find, sadly) almost all the population in Norway is condensed into very small areas along the edges. Michigan is all over the place (except for the UP, which is noticeably lower). Assuming they only installed charging stations where there are people, this means that while in Norway, you likely have access to a charging station wherever you drive, unlike Michigan. So basically, we&#x27;re comparing apples to kumquats here and you can&#x27;t just point to the popularity of Tesla as proof of anything other than Norway&#x27;s government was forward thinking.",1413557904

8471248,comment,8466053,8466053,0,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"Ultimately, the biggest issue with copywrong is this: on a rather fundamental level computers operate by <i>copying</i>, not <i>moving</i>. I mean: even the MOV instruction on most (if not all) instruction set copies data without overwriting the original. RAM (tends to) have non-destructive reads. The processor caches <i>everywhere</i>. Etc.<p>Sure, you could potentially talk about fixation as opposed to temporary copies - but that boundary is fuzzy and getting fuzzier all the time. What happens when the process gets paged to disk? What happens if the process crashes and dumps a crash report? Or worse - when memsistor RAM starts becoming available?<p>Also, there&#x27;s a related problem as to whom takes responsibility for a machine doing something. What happens when you walk by a security camera with a copywronged painting? If you visit webpage A that contains an iframe pointing to website B containing copywronged work, who is responsible for the copywrong infringement? Is it you? You own the computer. But you never did anything that you could have known was a violation. Is it the person who wrote your web browser, as they were the person who wrote the instructions to follow iframes? Is it the person who wrote webpage A? But they didn&#x27;t ever actually do anything infringing - they provided instructions which if followed without checking copywrong restrictions would potentially be a violation.<p>Personally, the entire idea of &quot;intellectual property&quot; is fundamentally misguided, but that is another matter.",1413557644

8471232,comment,8470824,8470824,0,0,_delirium,,,"One thing that is not making the discussion clearer is that many people are failing to distinguish between two different kinds of dependencies. Depending on a systemd <i>library</i> versus depending on the systemd daemons <i>running</i> are quite different scenarios. It would be ideal for the latter to be minimized, but the former is not a problem at all.<p>To take an analogy, plenty of Debian packages depend on libselinux1, because they feature optional selinux functionality, and not depending on libselinux1 would result in broken symbol tables. But most of these packages work perfectly fine without SELinux configured (as you might guess, since very few people actually have SELinux configured). Having libselinux1 on your system does not require you to use SELinux, and imo it would be unreasonable to complain that your system is now &quot;infected&quot; by SELinux because you can&#x27;t uninstall libselinux1. It&#x27;s just a library, like many others, and having it on your system doesn&#x27;t impose policy requirements on you as administrator or user. Yet people are making exactly that argument with systemd, complaining that some systemd library or another is on their system and thereby &quot;infecting&quot; it. Rather than focusing on the more legitimate issue of which packages actually require systemd daemons to be configured/running.",1413557426

Are you making the classic HN error of assuming that every reader lives in your country (usually the US)? Or do you think that every government is legitimate, no matter what, so long as it is not overthrown?<p>>If you remove the government, people band together into organizations that behave the same way: first you get something like a union where people pay dues and get certain benefits, their decision making structure evolves, and eventually the organization decides to cover everyone and force everyone to contribute. (It&#x27;s been quite amusing to watch this happening in miniature in eve online)<p>Eve Online is not a great example, imo, for a few reasons. First the corporation tax is built into the game&#x27;s mechanics. It is <i>assumed</i> that this is must be how all corporations will work. But that&#x27;s less of an issue than.. Two, corporation membership is indeed voluntary. It is exceptionally easy to leave a corp (minus a potential 24 hour stasis). Even if you&#x27;re deep in nullsec, you can get out. If you die trying, no big deal. This is <i>nothing</i> like living in a modern state, where even leaving said state can be subject to prohibitive border controls. And getting shot by an agent of the state doesn&#x27;t exactly follow by you ending up in a station where your clone was located. The involuntary nature of the state and the very real consequences of what it does immediately separates it from something akin to an Eve corp.<p>>Of course it&#x27;s possible to set arbitrary rules under which a government doesn&#x27;t form, or corporations provide something better, but those rules end up being very arbitrary.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any doubt that if a government suddenly didn&#x27;t exist, or could no longer pay its bills that we&#x27;d see alternative institutions take up the slack in certain areas. But it isn&#x27;t necessarily a state entity that would do so, and this is clearly a main point of disagreement here.",1413557403

Luckily, we were able to translate VM <-> docker container, so now each component has its own Dockerfile + shell script for booting up and providing runtime configuration.<p>Docker helps us solve several problems:<p>* A canonical build. It provides a way to configure the build system, fetch all dependencies and execute a reproducible build on different machines/environments. It&#x27;s also used as documentation when engineers have no clue, where settings/parameters come from.<p>* A super fast build pipeline and release repository. We use maven -> nexus, docker -> docker-registry, vagrant -> local export for a completely automated way to bootstrap an ovf-file that can be deployed at customer site. Releases for the old platform were not automated and took the previous teams weeks (!) on a single platform.<p>* A way to restrict resources. Given some security constraints from the product, lxc + docker helps us restrict memory and networking.<p>* Shipping updates. We deliver automated updates through a hosted docker registry for customers who open up the appliance to the internet. Previous teams were not able deliver updates in time for a single hosted platform. We can now ship new releases and have them deployed at several customers data-centers in a matter of hours.<p>We have been using docker in production for almost a year now and despite headaches in the beginning it&#x27;s been absolutely worth it.",1413556788

The config files are provided through a shared volume to the application. This model is definitely odd. However, it&#x27;s allowed us to decouple our application and our configuration and to swap out configurations. With this in mind, it&#x27;s more declarative because we specify &quot;run this application with this configuration unit&quot; rather than &quot;here&#x27;s how you get yourself started&quot;. See the Radial project for our inspiration[1]<p>We&#x27;ve found that this approach has generalized so far. For example, setting up a Cassandra cluster is often a real PITA to configure since you need the seed IPs up front. Our configuration container manages the dance by registering and pulling the IPs from Consul (etcd would work fine too). Perhaps a bit of smoke-and-mirrors, but it&#x27;s achieved being able to spin up a properly-configured Cassandra cluster without needing to manually specify who&#x27;s in the cluster.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://radial.viewdocs.io/docs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radial.viewdocs.io/docs</a>",1413556145

We need (open)solaris, openbsd, freebsd, netbsd and OS X - which means any Linux-only, not-very-portable solution to these things just should not be mainstream. Consider that jails on freebsd works with, but do not demand, zfs. Even if arguably zfs solved a lot more real nuisances and problems than systemd does.<p>Last time systemd was mentioned, I addressed the issue of the journal, and how it being prone to corruption on bad crashes didn&#x27;t really help its utility. There&#x27;s room for improvement in init handling (see eg daemontools/runit) - and there <i>may</i> be a case to replace init. But so far I&#x27;ve yet to see any compelling arguments for systemd that have much to do with systemd. And their stance on portability, and complexity demonstrate to me an absolute ignorence of risk: portability, simplicity and small components are effective tools to mitigate risk.<p>Probably the most compelling argument is that simple services can now have simple config files rather than complex redundant shell init scripts - but it must surely be possible to take a simple config and generate a correct script for most of those services that really benefit from simple configs (iow those that have pretty straightforward demands).",1413554898

But if you are hosting your own servers, then Docker provides close-to-metal performance with stateless behavior.<p>For example, when Heartbleed or Shellshock or POODLE hit the ecosystem, it took us 1 hour to recreate all our servers and be compliant.<p>My biggest complaint and wishlist is for Docker to roll-in Fig inside itself. The flexibility to compose services/stacks is very useful and Fig claims to be too closely tied to Orchard.",1413554453

They have a script that the users can invoke that shuts down the container, updates, runs some initialization tasks (`db:migrate` + some other stuff) and then brings the container back up.<p>3) Yep, we&#x27;re using mounted shared directories in both cases. Previously the laptops of course just stored everything on the local filesystem since they were running the app directly.

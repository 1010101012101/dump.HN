481090,comment,479676,480043,0,0,thwarted,,,"What is to keep an organized attack on a site's display method in IE8 by overuse of the 'compatibility mode' button when it's not appropriate?  Especially since tech-un-savvy users will then see a site in compatibility mode when they didn't do anything in their browser, and they'll assume the site is busted?<p>Also, at which point do we stop assuming the majority of users are not tech-savvy?  How much longer do they have to catch up?  Everyone knows which hole the food goes in, no one makes special easy-to-eat food for the food-un-savvy crowd.",1234616208
481089,comment,479596,479596,0,0,rdrimmie,,,"I think it depends a bit on how relevant community is to your application. If there's a community of users that is built up naturally by using your app (like there is at say Stack Overflow, which uses UserVoice) then you'll want to provide a place for the community to talk about features.<p>If your various users are generally unaware of each other, then I think that having a place for them to send you suggestions is fine.<p>My general thought is that building a system to handle suggestions before you have any is mildly premature. Provide an obvious way for users to send suggestions - a form or a prominent email address is usually fine - but wait until the flood of suggestions becomes a problem before solving it.",1234615983
481088,comment,481056,481056,0,0,tom,,,"So how are the articles ordered?  Does this order change over the course of the day?  Sure it's a great way to expose me to tons of info with very easy eye movement, but it's also tons of real estate.  How do I re-find an article or is that not really a problem?  If they're not going to foster user added content, then no; if they are, then it's a big problem.  I sure hope they also have a sortable list view (by post, by title, by author, by location, by popularity over a time period).  They have a big challenge and I agree than the present form could be improved, I'm just not sure this is the only best way to go.  Nice to see them pushing the envelope a bit though as it shows the get it and want to improve- two plusses in my book.",1234615977

481086,comment,480986,481080,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Dealers complained, but at the end of the day their profits are really in the service and maintentance of the cars much less in the initial sale. Most dealers get their profits only if they reach certain sales targets in the form of kickbacks.<p>As for how friends and family members buy their cars, most of them drive corporate lease cars.<p>Dealers get paid for the test-drives they arrange for such customers because it is a certainty in those cases that the dealer will not be involved in the actual sale.<p>One example of an online store for cars is:<p><a href=""http://www.nieuweautokopen.nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nieuweautokopen.nl/</a><p>(dutch, sorry and apologies for the irritating flash intro as well)<p>Of course the dealers are trying their hardest to sketch buying of a car through the internet as the most terrible decision you could make.<p>By law at least in Europe the whole concept of a brand dealer is no longer an acceptable concept, any car dealer can sell you any brand of (new) car. Importers / manufacturers can no longer make deals based on exclusivity.<p>I realize HN is US centric, in spite of that I would suggest a title of 'Why Americans can't buy a new car online'.",1234615879
481084,comment,480986,480996,0,0,vlad,,,"<i>There's a much simpler reason.  You can't test-drive a car online.</i><p>One wouldn't need to.  One could test drive a car at a dealership.<p>I'm not sure how that's a simpler reason than the fact that selling new cars without a dealer is banned in the US.<p>Most buyers research their new cars on the internet even though they can't test drive them on the internet.  Since they're on it already, ordering a car would not be difficult to swallow (there are already laws that allow buyers to return a new car for any reason within a certain time frame.)<p>Programmers are taught to try to cut out waste and save time and money, and they've tried to do so here.  From what I recall reading, web sites had been shut down because they tried to skip the dealers.  This shows that it is not a lack of customer confidence, but the force of the law that is keeping things as-is.<p>Finally, the argument that ""one can't test-drive cars online"" would be an important enough deterrent to an all-online purchase process does not consider that a new approach might be developed to allow potential buyers to test drive a car (such as for a price).  More realistically, consumers will test drive the cars of their friends, that were already highly rated on the internet, such as... the cars that are already popular today.<p>A downside is that with fewer dealerships and the new development of getting charged to test drive a car, cars will become less fun to drive and more feature- and safety-oriented.  But, that is already the trend.  Luxury car manufacturers will still have dealerships for that reason.",1234615733

That is the title, but there are three pages of text to go along with it.<p>The first word of the article mentions that this is American-centric and somewhere in the first few paragraphs, the author clarifies that he or she is writing about buying a new car without a dealer.<p>It is interesting to learn that you have been able to buy a new car directly from the manufacturer where you live.  Do you know if the dealers complained when this came about?  Also, do friends and family members buy new cars this way now?",1234615366

But even ignoring that, articles of American origins often limit their criticisms to those within their own country, same as British and Australian journalists often write about problems with their own.",1234614508

They sleep maybe 4 hours each night, a little more on weekends.

5994612,comment,5994035,5994035,3,0,gexla,,,"The article touches on this towards the end, but I think the Docker (or container) way would be to create separate containers for each process. I could very well be wrong on this though. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the best way to use containers.<p>One container would contain the Drupal files along with an Nginx or Apache process.<p>One container would run PHP (probably PHP-FPM.)<p>One container would contain MySQL.<p>This would allow for better scaling options. You could then run multiple containers for PHP processes and have the web server do a round robin between PHP containers. You could do the same for the container which has the Drupal files and put a load balancer in front of them. Any file based caching options would probably be best switched to something like Memcache so that the cached items are in sync.I suppose some content management systems would better accommodate this setup than others.<p>I&#x27;m not sure yet the best way to do development in the above setup. I suppose one way would be to run an SSH server on the Drupal container and then perhaps mount the files you need access to as a drive using SSHFS or something. I haven&#x27;t played with this yet, but you can also create volumes on the host OS to be shared with the container (I think I got that right.) Perhaps you could share the files that you need access to.<p>Am I right on this? Does anyone else do things differently? This project moves so fast it&#x27;s hard to keep up with.<p>Edit: I also wonder if containers create a performance hit for MySQL. You would also need make backups. Maybe you would be better off running a big DB on its own dedicated server / VPS outside a container?<p>I would also save all user generated files (for something like Drupal, this would be mostly images) to something like S3.",1373028280

5994564,comment,5993441,5993441,1,0,interject,,,"I get the feeling the neet problem in the west is strongly enabled by 4chan and related websites, which possible carries over similar values over from the Japanese.<p>What I mean by this is that any normal activity: going outside, talking to people (especially women), having full time employment, hell even masturbating to 3D porn (instead of hentai) is looked down upon. Stating that you do any of these is met with instant ridicule accompanied by a picture of George Costanza from Seinfeld and an implied quote, e.g. :<p>>2013
>going outside
>talking to women<p>Posters on 4chan wear their neet achievements like a badge of honor. How long they haven&#x27;t left their room for, how many cum/piss bottles they have filled up (with pictures for proof) or the latest anime they have marathoned.<p>Many just don&#x27;t see the need to reenter society. Their dietary needs are pretty basic. Entertainment is provided by video games and the sheer volume of anime being churned out by the studios these days, a lot of which consists of cute underage girls (or sisters) doing cute/sexually suggestive things. Sexual urges are fulfilled by the copious amounts of hentai available on the web.<p>Many have chosen &quot;waifu&quot;s (or &quot;husbando&quot;s depending on your orientation), which serve as their significant others. These waifu&#x27;s usually come from their favorite anime. They may just hold that waifu very dearly or they may adorn their walls with pictures of her or buy figurines of her. Some have dakki pillows of that characters which are full length body pillows with their character printed on it. The more deluxe versions have removable layers for the various layers of undergarments ( <a href=""http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/f73e8f13ea9e2762db0ab06531793c5d1356919797_full.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/f73e8f13ea9e2762db0a...</a> ). Some even have &quot;holes&quot;. You should see the dedication of these guys on valentines day; candle-lit dinners covered with rose petals. It would put most normal-fags to shame (however I still don&#x27;t get how a Thinkpad screen can eat chocolate cake). For in depth explanation of the waifu phenomenon see <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtwPPsBKGQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtwPPsBKGQ</a> .<p>But it is not just an affinity for 2D women. It&#x27;s a hatred of 3D / IRL women too. Most view 3D women as lying, manipulative whores who are not to be trusted. Contrast this to their imaginary waifu&#x27;s who will always love them and never betray. This is probably due their difficulties they have experience with women due to their personalities. There is even word for this is 3DPD: 3D Pig Disgusting.<p>Yes, I know &quot;mai waifu&quot; and &quot;3DPD&quot; started off as a joke, but it has gone way past that point. What started of as self-degrading humour has become deeply ingrained in the collective psyche of 4chann.<p>There is also the question of money. In Japan, most hikki stay with their parents, I assume mainly due to high rental costs there. But most of the 4chan posters who are neets (most aren&#x27;t and do actually hold sucessful full-time jobs, but the number who are is disproportionately high), get government funding and/or free housing. The funding usually comes in the disability benefits (for autism-spectrum/mood disorders, real or perceived) which they call &quot;autism bux&quot; or unemployment benefits. Also housing is pretty cheap in the west esp. in N. America and the Nordic countries, allowing them to live independently. I think this is one of the main differences between Western neets and hikki&#x27;s.<p>There is a lot of negativity there as you can imagine. What is scary is how easily this negative emotion is channeled. What was /b/, the general/most active board on 4chan, is now /pol/, the politics board. And with that jump comes feeding of far-right views like antisemitism and strong anti-black racism from that hate. But for some strange reason, they consider Koreans (East Aryans) and other asians (but not Indians) part of the master race. This is possibly due to their love of k-pop and anime.<p>We all remember donglegate with Adria Richards. That was originally picked up by /pol/ who worked the crowed and then passed it on to /b/ for execution. While HN saw it as political correctness gone mad, /pol/ saw it differently. Not only was she a liberal feminist, but she was a half n1gger k1ke-kess too!<p>There are many &quot;why aren&#x27;y you a neet?&quot; or &quot;neet masterrace&quot; threads, extolling the virtues of the neet lifestyles, ridiculing those who work, boasting about how much &quot;autism bux&quot; they get and swapping tips on how to get more. The thrify money-saving tips are pretty good too.<p>Again with the rise of /pol/ these threads have taken an anti-semetic twist. Right now there is a thread called &quot;ITT: Why Jews make you NEET&quot; <a href=""http://boards.4chan.org/pol/res/16647507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.4chan.org/pol/res/16647507</a> , but it probably will die quickly. Most of the posts are jokes, but I am uncertain as to what extent they consider their views as jokes vs reality.<p>4channers also understand the economic and social forces that put them in this neet situation. This is expressed in &quot;People who should die: Baby Boomers&quot; threads, mocking the employment advice baby boomers gave &quot;I paid my way through college by serving tables. I just walked up to the manager and he gave me a job.&quot; There are also threads of Penn Gillette binning resumes with sub 4.0 GPA&#x27;s for McDonald&#x27;s jobs, but that meme is far too complicated and contrived to explain.<p>Some neets just don&#x27;t want to go back to society in it&#x27;s current state. You see many threads comparing the degeneracy of a modern woman (e.g. a white woman race-mixing with a black man or just being promiscuous) versus a poster from Nazi Germany depicting nuclear aryan family. Again, this is an joke taken to the extreme, but it hides their possible views about today&#x27;s society. They feel that with more traditional gender roles not only would women be more approachable and their chance be better, the idea of a relationship would be more attractive as opposed to &quot;lol empowered womyn&quot;, i.e. sluts. They also hark back to the days of racial hegemony.<p>Another difference with Japanese hikkis, is that they become that way far earlier than their western counterparts. Many western neets lost their jobs in the economic downturn and just failed to re-enter employment as opposed to dropping out highschool. Many were coders who you can catch on the Daily Programming Threads (DPT) on /g/; some are pretty talented and are working on quite interesting projects. They even had a visual novel of SICP in the works at some point.<p>This post was intended to a far shorter reply, but I think it turned into a braindump about 4chan. But I&#x27;m trying to get across how 4chan enables people in the west to live the neet lifestyle. Posters even acknowledge this, &quot;if it wasn&#x27;t for 4chan I would still have a job/girlfriend/friends, instead I&#x27;m fapping to Touhou porn.&quot; It just sucks people in with it&#x27;s &quot;it&#x27;s ok to be a neet&quot; attitude.<p>If you&#x27;re curious take a look. /b/ has devolved into some sort of infantile cesspit. /pol/ seems to be where &quot;the happening&quot; is at. I generally think it&#x27;s best to browse 4chan while you still have a full time job. Otherwise you&#x27;ll end up spending too much time there, slowly warping your mind. Before you know it you&#x27;ll be fapping to futanari porn of you favorite anime telling people how jews control the world.<p>>inb4 jidf",1373027368

Ha, ha to them if they are that interested.&quot;.</i><p>The problem with a lot of civil liberties situations is that while the consequences of being the victim of a deliberate abuse or simply a mistake can be severe for the individual, the probability of being such a victim remains low, particularly if you&#x27;re a good little citizen and keep your head down. This allows the kind of &quot;it would never happen to me&quot; mentality that Pastor Niemoeller tried to warn us about.<p>Realistically, the expected damage to an individual citizen from (for example) a busted economy or poor healthcare or low quality education really is much higher than the expected damage from a government failing to respect the civil liberties of its citizens, so the &quot;meh, got bigger things to worry about&quot; crowd do have a point here. It&#x27;s just unfortunate that there is a lot of danger in the world and most people don&#x27;t have the time to expend on every possible danger to them or their loved ones, so they naturally favour concentrating on the dangers they perceive to be the biggest threats.<p>We&#x27;re supposed to have representative governments as a way to balance this problem, so that the people who are there as professional public servants have more time to consider the issues that aren&#x27;t numbers 1-N on the list. Alas, numbers 1-N on the list then become the deciding factors in the elections that determine those representatives instead, and anything from N+1 on down can be handled or mishandled as the representatives and whatever special interest groups have their ear see fit.<p>I&#x27;d like to say I have a solution to this, but it seems to be an inherent problem built into typical modern political systems. However, it&#x27;s deeply ironic that many governments&#x27; own actions in these cases seem to be doing exactly the opposite, letting the fear of a high-impact, low-probability event like a major terrorist attack dominate their agenda rather than dealing with vastly more important issues like the ones I mentioned before. I still don&#x27;t quite understand what&#x27;s really in it for them to constantly perpetuate the fear of crime and terrorism, nor for the media to collaborate in doing so. Surely spending all that time and money and public attention on high-profile, high-value projects that would actually make a difference to a lot of people&#x27;s lives would give them more political capital come election time, but at the moment it seems as if the political classes have lost all perspective.",1373026796

Them: &quot;Umm, no not really&quot;<p>Me: &quot;Ok, what if I flip it 100 times and it shows head 70 times?&quot;

The bases in Germany for instance were used for medical care of casualties from Iraq and Afganistan. It&#x27;s fair to say that without such bases, the US probably could not operate in the way it does.<p>The US has aquirred it&#x27;s bases for different historic reasons. Some, in the pacific, were leased off the UK for money. Others, like the bases in Japan and Germany, were forced on countries that lost a war with the US, and as few who fought in or supported that war are still alive, you can see why those countries might consider whether they benefit from them.<p>It is hard to separate beneficial activities that the US does, like the protection of shipping as it travels past East Africa, from it&#x27;s pursuit of strategic objectives, such as rivalry for dominance in Africa with the Chinese, and middle eastern power blocks. And in addition, there is a legitimate counter terrorism aspect, which probably benefits the US more than other countries.<p>The thing is that the US had a great deal of control over Western Europe, imposed by force in the 1940s, and declining since then, and this was achieved as part of a struggle between the US and USSR, where European countries were really pawns. As the power declines (in part due to increasing strength and unity between EU countries), it&#x27;s hard to imagine that the US will be able to maintain it&#x27;s bases.<p>I think you should try to see it more dispassionately. There is a strategic game, where people lose and win, often in different ways at the same time. As American power declines from it&#x27;s peak this century, it may be more comfortable to view it as a neccesary horror, rather than America&#x27;s god appointed role, as a lot of Europeans view their own countries real politique.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.heritage.org/2013/04/26/u-s-military-bases-in-europe-are-vital-to-americas-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.heritage.org/2013/04/26/u-s-military-bases-in-eu...</a>",1373026310

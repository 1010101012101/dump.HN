247206,comment,246606,247075,0,0,smelendez,,,"I think that it's not only that older people didn't grow up with, say, the Windows interface or, as someone mentioned earlier, a telephone interface where you have to press send to make a call, it's an even more basic issue. They grew up in a world where machinery was expensive, fragile and dangerous and a world where adults seldom learned to operate fundamentally new machinery. Even sturdy, harmless household machinery wasn't safe to ""play around"" with. One reason you had to dial 1 to make a long distance call, even before exchanges and area codes overlapped, is to reduce the risk of misdialing or misunderstanding your way into a big bill. If you pick up the phone in the middle of the night and dial random numbers to figure out the numbering scheme and whether it takes longer to call cross-country, you'll get a big bill and, if you piss enough people off, get a visit from the police or a stern letter from the phone company. If you enter random URLs into your browser, you're unlikely to break anything.<p>We (younger people) have an advantage in that we're used to pretty much everything being software driven, so we know that if we screw up our computer, phone or DVD player we can just pull the plug or the battery. We're also used to the idea that not every device will behave the same way to achieve the same function. We press ""send"" to ""send"" a call, but not to send an SMS message, even though the latter is standard usage and the former is not, but we don't care because we know that's how the UI works. And, we know that we'll have to keep learning new UIs as we get older. Older people don't have a problem dialing nine for an outside line, even though at home they just pick up the receiver, because they probably learned it in their 20s.",1216168656

247203,comment,246606,246932,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I'm just curious, what does it mean to ""comment intelligently"" on a literary work? It's a skill I never learned (1), nor could I even explain what the skill consists of. It hasn't really impeded my (non-corporate) career, although I did need to learn how to write when I got to grad school (note: I learned to write based on Principles of Software Engineering, not Strunk&White).<p>(1) I took english 101-102 at a community college, similar to what author describes.

  In the world of 5 MP Smartphones and 10 MP point and   
  shoot cameras that you can buy for under $200, why is the 
  iPhone still stuck with a measly 2 MP? That’s so 2003. 
  While we’re at it how come we can’t record video, afraid  
  the non-existent SD card might fill up? The iPhone should 
  be able to stream video by now just like many other cell 
  phones can already do right now. 
</code></pre>
Let's be fair - and I don't know the specs - but pixel count and linear resolution aren't the same thing.  A 2MP camera on the iPhone may be of better quality than the 6MP camera Canon sold you last month.<p>See my article submission (yes, I'm a karma whore) post for full explanation<p><i>update</i>: arggh!

If you reduce the supply of messages further and thus increase the price, it's likely you'll see higher quality messages -- which in turn should drive traffic.

The thing to be doing with the great bounty of western prosperity is reducing ignorance in ourselves and in others, not entertaining ourselves to imbecility.<p>People figured out at least 2,500 years ago that knowledge is the antidote for ignorance and even laid out the specific conditions for its acquisition.

247190,comment,247154,247154,0,0,gecko,,,"I think that the linked blog post goes a bit overboard. Atwood himself says repeatedly that you should start with a normalized schema; he just also says that denormalizing for performance reasons should not have such a strong stigma attached, given that it's the only way to make big, massive databases work correctly.  We can argue over whether Atwood is arguing to optimize a bit too early, but the general idea he's expressing is neither new nor (at least among experienced DBAs) disturbing.",1216166778

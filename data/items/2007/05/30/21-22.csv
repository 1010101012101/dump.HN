25506,comment,25503,25503,0,0,inklesspen,,,"First things: You need to know MVC, and you need to know Ruby. MVC takes a little while to wrap your brain around if you've only ever done things like PHP. There isn't really a great overview document for MVC, but if you do some google searching and wikipediaing, you can find some stuff. Understand what goes in the controller, and in the model, and in the view, and why we bother to separate them.<p>Then learn Ruby. There are a bunch of resources for this. Why's Poignant Guide is hilarious, but rather opaque. I recommend a book by David Black called Ruby for Rails, but I'm sure O'Reilly has some fine books too.<p>Now you're ready to start learning Rails.  The online documentation is usually poorly organized -- at best. If you can afford it, pick up Agile Web Development with Rails. It's in its second edition now, and is much much better at introducing you to rails than any online resource I've seen. Maybe someone else here can recommend an online tutorial I haven't seen, but they seem to generally be more out of date than the books, rather than the other way around.",1180560945

Sure it's cheap, but hosting companies tend to oversell this virtual boxes to people and performance is <i>not</i> the same, especially when it comes to disk I/O (any kind of I/O) and handling sudden CPU usage spikes.<p>$1,200-$1,600 for a server is not expensive. If you are trying to start up a company and you're an engineer yourself, that money is what? Your half week salary? Or we're talking about running things from a dorm room here? <p>You make very good point about reliability though. ",1180560586

I guess the philosophy of RoR is drastically different from what I'm used to.<p>How did you guys learn rails? I really want to learn it, but the tutorials aren't really working for me. ",1180560272

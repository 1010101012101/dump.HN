I'm thinking particularly of talks that amount to nothing more than a speaker reading out their slides which sometimes cause me to wonder: ""what value is being added by the speaker actually being here if I could just read this content in my own time?""<p>I suppose -- as other commenters have mentioned -- there are two audiences for slides:<p>* People who saw the presentation and want reference material;<p>* People who haven't seen the presentation and wish to substitute attendance with the slides alone.<p>Only the former audience is well served by conference organisers blindly demanding slides, the latter lack the context of the talk itself. What would be better is if some more complete version of a presentation was available (video, transcript, etc.) but this isn't always possible or permitted. The danger is that the easier option -- just providing slides -- actually miscommunicates the quality or intention of the presentation for those who weren't in attendance.",1290672395

You can usually identify the first several digits simply by the issuing organization, as they all use standardized numbers, the remaining digits must pass a certain checksum algorithm. So really generating a bunch of valid cc numbers is quite trivial. Matching exp dates with numbers and ccv numbers..

It even comes with a bit of a cultural/economic walling in also, with the connotations of the ""PHP programmer"" label.<p>With language/library environments there seems to at least be the potential for that sort of metaphorical isolation and limitation. I've heard people worry about whether there's a ""Lisp ghetto"" in that sense, especially post-1990s. That said, I agree that for this particular series of two posts, it doesn't seem to add much. It's something more like, ""the Ruby stdlib is bad / no it isn't"".",1290672196

It does have a lot of sugar, but playing with the DOM needs it. Crockford described the DOM as having been written by people who like Java[-esque things] and hold JavaScript and its style in contempt. I can't speak to the history, but the actual W3C DOM standards are such that that could certainly be true. The W3C DOM is not plain old JS. The W3C DOM is a verbose, clumsy API direct-ported from (essentially) Java into JavaScript.<p>> then it becomes so habitual that you forget how to write ""regular"" javascript.<p>I wish that were true. Unfortunately, I still have to drop back to W3C DOM for performance often enough. For a recent feature I added, 6 lines of jQuery becomes 24 lines of JavaScript, but the speed goes from unacceptable to acceptable. (What am I doing that jQuery's not fast enough? In this case keystroke-by-keystroke search and manipulation of a 6000-cell table.)",1212929480

212077,comment,210729,210729,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> <i>""Congress has written its own accounting rules — which would be illegal for a corporation to use""</i><p>It stupid to treat a Federal Government (of any nation with it's own sovereign currency) like a business when it comes to accounting. The nature of being the entity that creates a lot of the money (in the form of Treasury bills, banks create the rest via loans) means that doing this type of single entry accounting just doesn't make sense. Unfortunately this kind of article plays great for USA Today, where anything that terrifies the readership is great for business, like any other mass media outlet.<p>To see what I am talking about, check out this peice.[1] I'll even quote the relevant part:<p>> <i>""When government spends and runs deficits, it credits private bank accounts more than it debits them, thereby increasing the savings of [dollar denominated] US financial assets of the non-government sector.  In fact, non-government savings [...] can only increase if the government runs deficits, and they increase by that exact amount.  The reverse is true of surpluses. Government surpluses necessarily reduce non-government savings by that exact amount as well.<p>Therefore, the projection of a $5.6 trillion government surplus a few years back was also in fact necessarily projecting a $5.6 trillion drop in non government savings!  For all practical purposes, this was a ludicrous projection, as there is no way private savings can be reduced by that amount without virtually eliminating everyone's retirement accounts and in the process eliminating private spending, employment, and income.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/sr/sr0402/sr0402.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/sr/sr0402/sr0402.html</a><p>The rest of the policy proposals and case studies: <a href=""http://www.cfeps.org/pubs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfeps.org/pubs</a><p>By definition, running government surpluses means sucking more money out of the economy in tax revenue than it puts back in. At first this would be done by buying back all those treasury bills that make up the debt, taking trillions of savings away from private holders of said bills. Then, with nothing else to do with the excess tax revenue, the government would have to start buying assets, which would remove said assets from the private market, effectively sapping wealth from the private sector. In the end, all assets would be owned by the government. Of course, there isn't any real danger of this actually happening, but I'm trying to point out that the government will never <i>get it's act together</i> or <i>be profitable like a business</i> like so many people seem to desire. It just doesn't work that way.<p>What matters is that the government has enough tax revenue to pay interest on the money it creates (treasury bills), which it does. In fact, interest payments as a percentage of tax revenue are at the lowest point in the last 15 years.<p>On the other hand, I totally agree with the guy from Harvard:<p>> <i>""Accounting matters, the deficit number affects how politicians act.""</i><p>If it takes a big scary (and meaningless) number like the National Debt to keep them from going hog wild on the pork, then so be it I guess.<p>As for Social Security and Medicare: <a href=""http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/sr/sr0501/sr0501.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/sr/sr0501/sr0501.html</a>",1212927243

212075,comment,211782,211868,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Mod up for saying that language choice is primarily a matter of taste.<p>But, there were a few other considerations for me when I chose Python as my development language over PHP and Ruby.<p>I think that as far as language growth is concerned, Python has more buzz right now (no disrespect to PHP or Ruby intended).  Google's app engine is all about Python right now, and that's going to dramatically increase the traction of Python in the web development world.  Google is actively supporting Python development.  Google has a lot riding on Python because it's one of the 4 sanctioned languages at the GOOG.  I could be wrong, but I get the impression that Python is growing as a community and as a language faster than Ruby.  This is why I chose Python over Ruby.<p>I also chose Python, because I think that there's aspects to Python that will broaden my horizons and stretch me as a programmer as I learn it.  I don't really get that impression with PHP.  All things being equal, I'd rather learn a language that will stretch me as a programmer.",1212926994

The singularity does indeed seem to be more of a religious than a scientific vision - rapture for nerds. This is the only worthwhile sentence I find in this article.<p>John Horgan sounds like so many other critics declaiming that dramatic technological progress is impossible. History has in many examples proved critics wrong in a spectacular way. Although he doesn't say it directly, Horgan implies that ""thinking"" machines will not be created in at least 50 years - which to me sounds just as ridiculous as declaring heavier-than-air flight or space flight impossible.<p>The article doesn't really contain any decent points at all - the author cites neuroscience researchers east and west claiming that any dream of smarter-than-human machines are impossible, which seems to me as far from refuting any central argument. 'We don't understand the brain, so intelligence and consciousness can never be understood in a decent time-frame' seems to be as close to a key point as any I am able to interpret out of this.<p><pre><code>  The implication of his thought experiment is that our \n  psyches will never be totally reducible, computable, \n  predictable, and explainable"". \n</code></pre>\n<i>Never</i> explainable? Just like the stars, motion, nuclear physics and the rest of the human body?<p>Cochlear implamts are also cited as having ""poor sound quality"" - how does this prove that implants won't get better?<p>There is really nothing to see here - perhaps there would be if the author made his points a bit clearer.",1212926410

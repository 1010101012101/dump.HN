Often more expensive than a house. They are not a decision to be made lightly, and you shouldn&#x27;t get pity for having them since its common knowledge how expensive they are.<p>Its probably one of the greatest critical failings of our society in modern terms to pressure people so highly to have kids they cannot afford - its not just bad on a macroeconomic level because it makes those parents dependent on the state, and on average results in poverty stricken kids who have had studies prove growing up poor has a direct and negative impact on intellect, but its bad for individuals because it will destroy otherwise healthy relationships if children are too expensive but they gave into short term peer pressure and got long term consequences.",1448081958

My wife and I split the year of unemployment-insurance-covered leave (half your salary if your salary is mediocre, and that&#x27;s the cap) here in Canada and it was the best decision of my life.  I got 7 months of full time dad duty in and it changed me.<p>My company and her school both offered a modest top-up on the government&#x27;s parental leave benefit, so splitting the year meant we got to double-dip our employee benefits.<p>So it&#x27;s not just good family building, it&#x27;s also good financial sense.

I have had this become a bottleneck in my work, and it&#x27;s very rare to use CSPRNGs in scientific simulations for this reason.<p>> What does this even mean? Non-uniform distribution for CSRNG is fatal. What is an RNG that has &quot;better&quot; distribution than CSRNG?<p>There are distributional properties other than uniformity, and depending on how you use these numbers (e.g. Monte Carlo kernel form) these can be far more important than linear uniformity. The author briefly mentioned this in the article (&quot;CSPRNGs emphasize unpredictability over all other measures of quality, some of which might be more important for your use case&quot;).

10605694,comment,10605067,10605067,0,0,alexvr,,,"I find this deeply disturbing, particularly because there has never been a better time in recent history to NOT give a damn about how you perform in traditional school systems, if you are unlucky or ignorant enough to be imprisoned in one in the first place. Competitive anxiety is one thing when it compels people to achieve amazing things, and another entirely when it clouds judgment and makes people miserable and on edge so they can merely out-compete the next person, even if the entire competition is largely just a contrived and futile ego game to begin with. People should first think long and hard about <i>why</i> they are striving for whatever it is they are stressing over.<p>But the truly disturbing thing is that traditional schools still exist, and a frightening number of people -- even some smart people! -- still consider the system humane and somehow necessary. I sometimes can&#x27;t believe that my younger self was effectively forced to do push-ups, run laps, eat lunch in a crowded cafeteria (that is, navigate the social landscape as someone with anxiety), and memorize court cases, poems, and Greek column types because some older person decided that it was good for me. Because overall it wasn&#x27;t, and the reason I managed to finish K-12 as a reasonably educated human being instead of a sheep is that I realized the contrived nature of traditional education very early -- like, second grade -- and placed <i>actual</i> education (and, maybe unfortunately, silly but outrageously fun MMORPGs) above “school for the sake of grades”. I learned a lot from school, and even plenty from coursework, but I can hardly imagine the superior human I might be had I been allowed to focus on my personal interests and learn at my own pace.<p>School is a <i>really bad</i> place for smart kids. It’s disgusting. For every would-be gang member or fry cook who turns out significantly better because he was forced to attend school, there are probably many thousands of bright young people who would much rather be inventing something, experimenting, productively socializing, or studying what they find interesting. If I do one meaningful thing in my life, it will be helping to make that the norm. It’s really a sad thing that some kids with plenty of potential are misguided into thinking that a GPA is more important than knowledge, experience, curiosity, and comprehension. And it’s an <i>atrocity</i> that staggeringly gifted young people can grow up thinking they’re poorly endowed weirdos because, instead of memorizing their way through school, they struggle to actually understand things since their minds refuse to take “that’s just how it works” for an answer, and they bother to &quot;waste time&quot; wondering, &quot;What if...?&quot;<p>There are far more humane ways to criminally detract from the most important years of young American lives, if that’s the goal of compulsory education.",1448081728

As they repeatedly show, it would be very difficult for them to prove that, since they&#x27;d have to usefully measure delta in intelligence.<p>The burden of proof should be on anyone who claims to have an intelligence boosting method. The field is littered with hucksters who have claimed to succeeded; this was true in the &#x27;60s when Jensen first wrote on it, and it&#x27;s still true now. It&#x27;s the cold-fusion of psychology (something which is theoretically possible, would be immensely valuable practically, and has never panned out when examined rigorously).<p>Anyway, Haier&#x27;s paper is not intended to be comprehensive, and we can point to some examples of investigating claimed intelligence increases and seeing that they indeed turn in the predicted null effect on intelligence: te Nijenhuis et al 2007, te Nijenhuis et al 2014, etc. See my other comment with link to citations & fulltexts.",1448081536

10605672,comment,10558938,10568278,0,0,gwern,,,"There are actually several distinct issues with Jaeggi 2008. The speeding is a concern but it increasing looks like it&#x27;s not driving the score increase. The passive control group is a big issue (although Jaeggi et al, via Au, are doing their best to fight to the grim end and deny it as long as possible). As is the subsamples using different IQ tests.<p>Finally, as Haier spends a lot of time explaining, pre-post test gains is fundamentally invalid as a way of proving testing increases the g-factor, because such gains are necessary but not sufficient; an increase in intelligence should show up as a gain, but many non-increases will also show up as a gain because despite the best efforts, IQ tests do not measure solely intelligence.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly understanding that this is as big a problem for n-back as the passive control group inflation. Many attempts to increase intelligence in the past, some where there was no dispute at all that test scores did increase, have failed as soon as a latent variable analysis was applied; I&#x27;m not aware of any which passes. All of the interventions had increased scores on only some subtests, and there were no general gains; they had not increased intelligence, only taught a specific subdomain. So our prior is highly against n-back being the exception. Worse, several studies have already tried to apply the latent variable analysis, and they <i>all</i> indicate that n-back flunked. So our already exceedingly skeptical prior gets reinforced by evidence of no effect on intelligence, whatever one subtest like a matrix test might say. (If Au or Jaeggi have addressed this, I have not seen it yet. They prefer to concentrate on the fact that the test scores increase and that you can cast doubt on the active/passive criticism by trying to correlate with whether a study was done in the USA or not, or whether the control group gained enough pre/post.)<p>You can see some links discussing the topic, including Haier&#x27;s methodological argument here, in point #3 in <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis#analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis#analysis</a>",1448081182

HDMI adapters have processors. Wireless transmitters and receivers have processors. Linking all those processors together requires - you guessed it, a processor. By the time you get there, the cost difference between a dedicated micro processor chip like a mouse or keyboard controller compared to a fairly powerful SOC like the ARM chip on a RaspberryPi is down in the &quot;cup of coffee or two&quot; range.<p>You could pretty much do exactly what you describe with a RaspberryPi and some software - instead of two or three dedicated mouse/keyboard/monitor tx/rx pairs, you plug those peripherals into the &#x27;Pi and use WiFi and software. (Note: a RaspberyPi isn&#x27;t the ideal candidate for this, they made design decisions way back that limit the network throughput, so I don&#x27;t _think_ you&#x27;ll get full HD video over the WiFi adaptor because of the way it&#x27;s sitting on the relatively slow and congested USB bus, but that&#x27;s not a fundamental flaw in the idea, just an implementation detail the &#x27;Pi designers chose to make back in &#x27;12 or &#x27;13 that you wouldn&#x27;t need to follow now...)<p>For very little more than a Raspberry Pi (plus power supply and USB WiFi adapter), you can get many &quot;mini pc&quot;s now - I&#x27;ve got an Ainol Mini PC which is an entire Windows 8 machine, with WiFi/USB/HDMI/power-supply(including an internal battery good for ~10hours) - and you can get them for around $80US ex China now. I&#x27;m not sure how much more &quot;compact/cheap&quot; you&#x27;re thinking of, but I wonder how big the market of people who would use your hypothetical gadget but only buy one at a pricepoint somewhere under $80 is - when the alternative is a full blown, if somewhat under powered PC.",1448081008

Any work I&#x27;ve done was mainly custom module development, soap, rest apis, aws integrations, ecommerce, etc. Pretty app heavy stuff. It&#x27;s not well suited for these tasks but it can do them if you get creative. This, of course, has great overhead and complexity.<p>I&#x27;m going to look closely at other options. It seems at this level that Drupal has been outgrown and that once you hit that point, for me, it feels like pressing the reset button and starting over. I&#x27;m bummed it has a growth ceiling.<p>I also feel strongly that the productivity level is deceiving. You race out of the gate with clicky this and module that, to later find working with a custom data model to be extremely painful or that you can only do things via interface and not in code. Unit testing, at least in 7 is non existent. Short term gains and long term pains. It does not feel like it was ever designed with developer speed and procutivity in focus.<p>So while I&#x27;m curious to hear of the new release I also just feel you can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks.

As you point out CSS and JS are cached for a long time, such that the browser <i>doesn&#x27;t even have to make a request</i>.<p>My understanding of this &quot;application shell&quot; is that even the HTML response is given a cacheable / far-future expiration header.<p>Is that even possible? It would be cool, if so. If you type &quot;foo.com&quot; in your address bar, could your browser say &quot;ah, I&#x27;ve already got this response cached, here you go, here&#x27;s your HTML, CSS, and JS&quot;? That would literally be an instantaneous load with no network round trip at all. Then the JS could kick in and fill in the shell with whatever the actual dynamic content is.<p>That&#x27;s different from a normal webpage which just caches the assets, since it still has to make a full request to get the HTML. Especially on phones, even if the response is small in size, the latency of the request/response cycle can be somewhat long (almost a second).<p>Edit: After further playing around with app-shell.appspot.com and your site, I see where you&#x27;re coming from. Both of them respond to a refresh in <10ms (my browser takes the content from the cache). app-shell loads from the web worker, your page loads from the browser&#x27;s cache (why? It has a no-cache header).<p>However, I guess the difference is the app-shell one is able to load dynamic content into its shell, even with the instantaneous from-cache load of the outer shell. I think the perceived performance will be about the same (since the browser paints the shell immediately), but it is able to be dynamic.",1448079653

Bonus: you&#x27;re not even effectively learning the material you&#x27;re nominally studying. Cut back to a sane workload. If they won&#x27;t let you stay in that course at that rate, transfer to something else, or drop out entirely. If being a homeless derelict would improve your standard of living, you need to do <i>something</i> other than what you&#x27;re doing.",1448078723

Write down the top 5 goals that someone coming to the site might want to reach. For example, &quot;Find out what Io is&quot; is probably #1, &quot;See what the syntax looks like&quot; is probably another, and &quot;Learn the benefits over other languages&quot; is probably a third. You&#x27;d be able to come up with a better list than me by looking at your analytics (what pages people visit most).<p>2. Write these goals down. Then ask someone who has never seen the site before to accomplish them right in front of you. <i>Don&#x27;t</i> explain anything and <i>don&#x27;t</i> interact with them until they&#x27;re done.

I graduated from Gunn (the other PAUSD high school) in 2013 and it was definitely a time I remember as a very happy and excited time of my life. I had excellent teachers, especially in Math/Science/CS, who really connected with students and got us excited about learning difficult topics past the point that would be expected from a public high school. The workload was quite manageable, even with multiple AP classes, and I always got my 8 hours of sleep. Most students I knew never really personally felt the level of stress that is so publicized online.<p>Perhaps my experience is different from the ones posted online because I had parents that, both because our aspirations were aligned and because they were always very supportive, let me choose what choose what I wanted to focus on in school and after school. Perhaps its because I took mostly &#x27;advanced&#x27; classes, where teachers are more likely to focus their attention, and did well in them without expending an unhealthy amount of effort. Perhaps me and others who enjoyed Gunn were just lucky, but I have a sneaking suspicion that these articles are written because they are easy: the alarmist pieces repeat what&#x27;s been said before and always end up quickly becoming hugely popular.<p>I just wanted to make that the takeaway is not that the teachers are unqualified or need to be reprimanded; the teachers at Gunn are excellent and very much appreciated.",1448078475

Its a great deal for a blog or anything normal... <p>If you need the bandwidth though, you can go to S3.  Easily you could host your html at their site and then use S3 for the big files ($0.20/GB BW cost, $0.15GB storage cost at S3).<p>I think site pricing is based on the theory that people think that bandiwth is expensive and they are afraid of using too much-- so Dreamhost offers huge bandwith in their plans--- but they won't actually let you use it.   Most places are like this... which makes nearlyfreespeach.net a really good-- honest and straightforward-- choice. <p> ",1178456236

Amazon's uptime is not that great.  In fact, Amazon is probably one of the worst run ""engineering"" companies around.  They hire bright people (generally) they just don't make them managers. <p>Before I left, my manager (after a reorg) was a totally incompetant jerk whose prior training was a degree in ""criminal justice"".  He knew nothing about software development, and had been at amazon his whole career- 7 years managing programmers. <p>I am amazed that they have only a few days of downtime a year.<p>I wouldn't be using S3 myself, except that (contrary to advertisements) its not run on the same ""proven"" infrastructure as their ecommerce platform-- but a new one built by a seperate team, and that team isn't hobbled by the incompetance that has built up over the years on the ecommerce engineering side.<p>",1178455963

I've figured out what that odor is... I couldn't quite put my finger on it for the longest time, but now that I've identified it, its very distinct.<p>Its smug.",1178455664

Apple just ordered 500 million 4GB flash chips from Samsung, this is on top of their long term contract with Samsung.  This is far more than can be accounted for by the iphone or ipod demand (And are expected to be shipped by the end of this year.)<p>Intel announced Robson technology awhile ago, which ships in their ""Santa Rosa"" platform which is scheduled to ship in May - this month. <p>Apple has gone a bit longer than usual in releasing laptops... they are overdue for both MacBooks and MacBook pros.<p>On June 11th Steve Jobs will be giving the keynote at WWDC.<p>Last week Apple announced that they would be shipping laptops with LED based displays ""later this year"".  Such a change will require a design change in the laptop- eg: a new formfactor.  It might be like the aluminum books now, not really a new looking formfactor compared to the Titanium powerbook-- but thuroughly new internally. <p>Thus, I think the odds are very good that new laptops will be announced on June 11th and that the difference will be significant enough that its worth waiting a month before buying your mac.<p>",1178454284

In a way, yes, but the opposite of that is countless crappy ""three of us at a barbeque party"" pics. Given a choice, I'd stick to those pretentious hobbyists, because creativity is pretentious by definition. (But not everything that's pretentious is worthwhile, of course.)",1178454040

Did you try running under parallels? <p>Anyway, 5 years ago, getting Linux running on a Powerbook was really easy... I would think it would be better now, not worse...",1178453903

You're giving me rumor and second hand inuendo and no stats.   You say you can't remember them offhand, but I don't think you ever heard any-- that weren't made up on the spot. <p>The fact of the matter is, there are many very successful startups in Seattle, Portland, Chicago, New York, Boston, Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, etc. etc. etc. <p>People in the BAY AREA think that the BAY AREA is necessary for success for a startup.<p>But they are not taking from any kind of a scientific knowledge.<p>Its just provincial arrogance.",1178453516

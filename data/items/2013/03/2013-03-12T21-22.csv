If more weren't, then O'Reilly wouldn't exist today.  After all self-publishing is nothing new.

Even a dry alcoholic has troubles with alcohol, and may need to struggle with that, even though they are successful in containing their affliction.<p>Similarly, some people will always be susceptible to depression (I coin the term ""depressives""). But, like an alcoholic can learn how to stop themselves from drinking, a depressive can learn how to prevent themselves from sinking into an actual episode of depression. There is always an underlying condition that never goes away: in alcoholism it's a compulsion, while in depression it's... something else. But the struggle to contain that condition goes from being a lost battle, to occasional temporary victories, to a day-to-day thing, until eventually it's just a thing.<p>So, you can't beat depression in the sense of winning a final victory and then it's gone forever. A depressive will always be a depressive, even when not in the middle of an episode of depression (and there's more to that than just sometimes becoming depressed--and not all of it is bad!).

5365021,comment,5363003,5364408,11,0,tikhonj,,,"I actually also really love OCaml. It has some truly brilliant features which Haskell lacks like polymorphic variants (and structural sub-typing in general) and a top-notch module system. (Much unlike Haskell's ""worst-in-class"" module system.)<p>Haskell does have a bunch of advantages though. A pretty petty one is syntax: Haskell's is simpler, prettier, more consistent and yet more flexible. They're very similar, of course, but I think Haskell gets all the little details right where OCaml often doesn't.<p>The single biggest advantage Haskell has--more than enough to offset the module system, I think--is typeclasses. Typeclasses subsume many of the uses of modules, but can be entirely inferred. This moves many libraries from being too awkward, inconvenient and ugly to use to being a breeze. A great example is QuickCheck: it's <i>much</i> more pleasant to write property-based tests in Haskell because the type system can infer how to generate inputs from the types. Being able to dispatch based on <i>return</i> type is also very useful for basic abstractions like monads. Beyond this, you can also do neat things like recursive typeclass instances and multi-parameter typeclasses.<p>Honestly, if I was forced to pick a single Haskell feature as the most important, I would probably choose typeclasses. They're extremely simple and a foundation for so much of Haskell's libraries and features. Most importantly, typeclasses are probably the most obvious way the type system goes from just preventing bugs to actually helping you write code and making the language more expressive, in a way that a dynamically typed language fundamentally cannot replicate.<p>Laziness in Haskell is not really a big deal. It can make much of your code simpler, but it also makes dealing with some performance issues a bit trickier. It also tends to make all your code more modular; take a look at ""Why Functional Programming Matters""[1]. I am personally a fan of having laziness by default, but I think it's ultimately a matter of philosophy.<p>And philosophy, coincidentally, is another reason to learn Haskell: it takes the underlying ideas of functional programming further than OCaml. In Haskell, everything is functional and even the non-functional bits are defined in terms of functional programming. Many ""functional"" languages are actually imperative languages which support some functional programming features. OCaml is one of the few that goes beyond this, but there is really a qualitative difference when you go all the way.<p>Once you know that everything is functional by default, you can move code around with impunity. You on longer have to worry about the order code gets evaluated in or even if it gets evaluated at all. You also worry far less about proper tail calls, which mostly compensates for having to deal with some laziness issues.<p>Haskell also embraces the philosophy in another way: you tend to operate on functions like data even more than in OCaml. The immediately obvious example is that Haskell has a function composition operator in the Prelude. There is no reason for OCaml to <i>not</i> have this, but--as far as I know--it doesn't. It's an illustration of the philosophical differences between the two languages. On the same note, Haskell also tends to use a whole bunch of other higher-order abstractions like functors and applicatives.<p>So I think the most compelling difference is ultimately fairly abstract: Haskell just has a different philosophy than OCaml. This ends up reflected in the libraries, language design and common idioms and thus in your code. I think that by itself is a very good reason to learn Haskell even if you know OCaml; and since you do, picking Haskell up will be relatively easy!",1363123697

Not only that: two of the recent 4 TLS problems (BEAST's chained CBC IVs and CRIME's compression side channel) are equally likely to affect custom cryptography --- they aren't the product of any weird SSL/TLS requirement. Chained CBC IVs also happened in IPSEC; compressing before encryption was IIRC an _Applied Cryptography_ recommendation. The only reason the RC4 bug is unlikely to apply is that nobody outside of TLS server operators would choose RC4.<p>To be sure: your best options (PGP and TLS) are creaky and scary looking. But they are nowhere nearly as scary as the ""New"" cryptosystems people deploy. What's especially annoying about the new stuff is that they follow a release cycle that conceals how terrible they are:<p>* Initial release with great fanfare about the new kinds of applications they'll enable, press coverage<p>* Security researchers flag unbelievably blatant flaws in crypto constructions<p>* Blatant flaws are fixed, cryptosystem is rereleased, now with promotional text about the external security testing it has<p>For a cryptosystem published by someone without a citation record in cryptography, a basic crypto flaw should be considered disqualifying; it's a sign that the system was designed without an understanding of how to build sound crypto. But that's not how things actually work, because everyone wants to believe that cryptographic protection is the Internet's birthright and that we're all just a few library calls away from ""host-proof"" or ""anonymous"" communications.<p>If you're really worried about TLS security but have the flexibility of specifying arbitrary crypto, why not use a library that does TLS with an AEAD cipher, like AES-GCM?",1363123547

But with O'Reilly's authors, a publishing house is a <i>convenience</i>, not a necessity, worthy of a fair price, not the total pwnage and incompetence typical in the field and recounted in this piece (""...I was paying for it dearly, allowing OReilly to retain all but a small fraction of net sales"").<p>So again, if O'Reilly is going to treat their authors like helpless novelists who've typed out their manuscript on an old-school mechanical typewriter and have no chance of self-publishing without years of effort and training, why don't they just start publishing novels? Is there really a market for a classical publishing arrangement when your authorship is perfectly <i>capable</i> of self-publishing, but would just prefer not to do so?",1363123064

Similar techniques animated BEAST, CRIME, and Lucky 13.<p>Now, for sites that use RC4 (to mitigate BEAST and Lucky 13), attackers can take advantage of a flaw in RC4: RC4's keystream output has biases throughout the first 256 bytes. Over millions of trials, these biases make it possible to use basic statistics to predict cookies, from the vantage point of a passive attacker.<p>This is one of the easier-to-understand TLS flaws of the last few years. RC4 is simple: you key it and it spools out a Hard-to-predict stream of random bytes, which are XOR'd to the plaintext. If those bytes aren't Hard to predict in some way, the attack is obvious. Now that (a) we know how to get browsers to generate millions of sessions (hello, BEAST) and (b) half the Internet is now using RC4 (thanks, BEAST), these RC4 attacks have become germane.<p>My guess is that these attacks are (1) noisy, (2) slow, (3) unreliable, and (4) expensive --- not in a ""need a grid of PS3s to exploit"" kind of way, but in a ""nobody will cast a broad net across the Internet with this attack"" sort of way.<p>But the vulnerability is also plainly unacceptable, in a way that I don't think is true of ""Lucky 13"" (which isn't intractable to fix in application code, just very annoying to fix).<p>It looks like we're finally reaching a place where TLS compat is going to stop dictating what attacks we mitigate and how, because unless we opt to accept the risk of poor ""Lucky 13"" fixes, there's no compatible way out.

Does it depend on relatively homogeneous communities like Reddit (SOPA) and HN (this)? If there is a proliferation of such communities, say subreddits or otherwise, could we expect this to happen more frequently? Do we want it to happen more frequently, or do we run the risk of, say, DHS running a pro-search campaign like China's 50 cent army? I'm just curious about why this seemed so striking to me.<p>This also fits in with an article I'd been meaning to read by Fukuyama[0] on social capital written 15 years ago.<p><i>The vice of modern democracy is to promote excessive individualism, that is, a preoccupation with one's private life and family, and an unwillingness to engage in public affairs. Americans combated this tendency towards excessive individualism by their propensity for voluntary association, which led them to form groups both trivial and important for all aspects of their lives.</i><p>Perhaps we'll see more of these spontaneous actions as voluntary associations are easier to make as the infrastructure that supports them (e.g. reddit) becomes more well known and fine-tuned.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/1999/reforms/fukuyama.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/1999/reforms/fuk...</a>",1363122862

When this gets unwieldy, you can start a new ""board"" - a board is a collection of lists.<p>If you want, you can add notes to any item in a list, and other people can add comments. There are options for watching items, lists, and boards such that you can get alerts when something changes or is added.<p>It's very flexible. Spolsky has said the original idea traces back to when he was a program manager at Microsoft on Excel, and during customer visits he discovered the vast majority of users simply used Excel to lay out lists -- they didn't care about advanced features like formulae or macros.",1363122345

This might be a personal problem: it makes me a little uncomfortable that the program just added this new functionality to itself without asking me.  Is it normal for me to feel this way?  Or is this how it should be, and I'm just used to all my old programs (MS Office, Adobe etc) asking me for permission before updates? I mean honestly I like this update and I haven't had any dropbox new feature that I didn't immediately love (Except for the automatically ask me to import photos from my iphone feature) but what if they decide to remove a feature in the future...  I guess since this is a subscription service I should set my expectations appropriately, that service will change, unlike buying Microsoft Excel for example which will just work and keep the old features until I buy the new version.",1363122205

Imagine the CS professor writing a book on the latest hot language.  He'll need an editor; how does a CS professor go about finding a trustworthy one?  He'll need cover art; he'll need to know how to create ebooks (computers are a wide field and just because you're an expert in Dart doesn't mean you know how to create an epub file).  You'd have to deal with printing your book and knowing all the lingo there.  Typesetting, etc.  Maybe you have amateur HTML knowledge; you could put together an epub, but would it look professional?<p>All of this is learnable.  Does that mean <i>everyone</i> should do it themselves?  Or that <i>everyone</i> has the time or inclination to do it themselves?  No.  Maybe the CS professor could learn it all, but they're too busy teaching classes or doing research.  Or maybe the minutae of self-publishing doesn't interest them.  Publishers like O'Reilly exchange part of your profit for bringing their domain knowledge to the table and doing it all for you.

2092813,comment,2092273,2092273,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"I'm seriously debating pre-ordering one on February 3rd as I'm an existing Verizon customer. My only hold-up is whether or not they'll release and LTE version in June. Assuming Apple does have the hardware ready by then, what's the likelyhood of Verizon having a substantial LTE presence by then as well?<p>Does anyone know what their LTE coverage looks like or how soon it'll match their 3G coverage? I'm under the impression LTE is only in major cities at the moment.",1294768796
2092812,comment,2091194,2091194,0,0,sfphotoarts,,,"For anyone serious about image production the cost of the software, like the cost of the camera and lenses is insignificant. For most photographers bit depth is only something they give much thought to when a client dictates (like a stock agency requiring a 16bit tiff, for example). For the vast majority of people just making images, 8 bit depth is perfectly fine. Most sensors in digital cameras are not anywhere near 16 bit anyway, more likely 12 or sometimes 14.<p>The photoshopessentails links below will obviously illustrate a difference (but not one that is very striking considering the destructive editing applied) - its a classic dynamic range compress/expand to show the benefits of higher quantization levels. Obviously that will degrade an image. Nobody, I suspect, is willing to show a side by side comparison of an image showing ordinary editing with rounding errors that make the slightest different to the image.<p>Most output is computer screens anyway where there is so much more impacting the image than rounding errors in editing stage. When you print an image that also introduces its own set of transforms, some have the benefit of making much that is visible on the screen (like moderate chroma noise) largely go away.<p>I dislike GIMP because it lacks the polish and sophistication of Photoshop but good photographs are good photographs, regardless of rounding errors in adjustment layers. When you look back at the last century of images, how many of those photos do you say would be improved had they more resolution, or less banding or whatever technical nonsense metric you want to apply.",1294768766

None of the things that you listed really have an effect on a causative relationship between education and income (even though they might be contributing factors to both).<p>From a common sense perspective, quite a number of high paying jobs require a technical or professional degree. When you post a job listing, there are often educational requirements. If you don't have a college degree, the highest paying fields, such as doctor, lawyer, engineer... are completely closed off to you. With the industrialization of HR in modern companies, certain things, like years of education, are certainly used to 'weed out' candidates. (Try applying to an engineering job with just a GED).<p>Aside from that, the author isn't really implying a causal relation, he is just stating a strong statistical correlation.

2092778,comment,2092298,2092612,0,0,equark,,,"While your point is theoretically valid, the evidence in the academic literature suggests that the causal effect of education on earnings is roughly the same as one would get by doing a naive regression of earnings on education at the individual level.  There's a bias with respect to ability, but it's on the order of 10 percent, and measurement error in education variables attenuates the naive estimates, balancing things out.<p>There are a number of natural experiments that caused specific groups to get more education than others. This evidence has led to a pretty broad consensus that the returns to one additional year of education are about 10 percent.

Patio wrote a great blog post about this recently, and there was a ton of HN discussion about it. The shortest answer is that not all the degrees are the same. All these studies really show that a lot of engineers, doctors, lawyers, and yes people in finance, make a good salary and are less likely to be unemployed. That does not mean that college is a good value for everyone. Many people would more likely benefit greatly from learning to be a plumber, mechanic, or other trade than getting a degree in american history. Sure, if you have the money to burn on the experience, fine. But, the idea that a degree in a non-professional field (especially if financed via loans) is worth it should be over.<p>Link to discussion: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2074044"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2074044</a>",1294768120

He did that in this article, and I've seen him and others do the same in other places.<p>But the fact is, it's pretty damn complicated.  At least it was, to me, but I realize now that's just because I didn't grok functional programming in the slightest.  Scala seriously turned me off at first, and I found it very hard to learn.  There's a lot of little tricks it does, and special rules.  Like how there are many different ways do progressively shorten inline function definitions.  For example: you can either say: ""args.foreach(arg => println(arg))"", or you can say ""args.foreach((arg:String) => println(arg))"", or you can just say ""args.foreach(println)"". And the books I have explain that in kind of a complicated way that explains partial functions way sooner than I was ready to understand. All those different options of ways to do things made me have a hard time understanding what the ""right"" way to do things was.  Similarly, the ability to do ultra-shortcuts on inline function definitions really confused me at first, for example being able to say map(_ + _) instead of (a,b => a + b).<p>For loops were also kind of bizarre to me.  I remember thinking, ""Jeez, would it kill you to just let me write a frickin loop for goodness sake?""<p>I perceived all this as excessive trickery and complexity in the language, and decided to bite the bullet and learn Erlang, instead.  Erlang is a far, far easier language to learn.  It was a breeze, actually, once I relaxed and forced myself to embrace it instead of hate it.  (I failed to do so on a previous attempt to learn it.)  In the process, something amazing happened:  I started wishing that I had access to a lot of those things that I initially hated so much about Scala.  I started wishing that I could write map(_ + _) instead of writing map(fun(A,B) => A + B end, L) like Erlang was forcing me to do.<p>Point is, if you're finding Scala off-putting or overly complex, like I did, then consider taking the time to learn functional programming with Erlang.  You may even decide you like Erlang better.  Erlang is better for some kinds of applications and situations.  But for me, I found it way easier to learn Erlang first.  Because until I was <i>forced</i> to do pure functional programming, I didn't appreciate the value of it.  It prepared me to really appreciate Scala.",1294767610

In that respect, we are nearly <i>all</i> (well at least those with good middle-class jobs) getting richer - we get pay rises, we save, we make investments etc.<p>But that phrase is actually talking about the type of comparison where you have a look at, say, the top 1% of earners, and compare their income to the bottom 50%.  We see that the ratio of the average earnings of the two groups is swaying to in favour of the top 1%.  That is not nearly such an obvious result.  Rich people die, they split up their fortune to give to their children, which should help level things out, but no, we still see that segment of society getting steadily richer faster than anyone else.<p>Another way of looking at it would be to compare velocity to acceleration.  You are talking about the rich having a bigger velocity increase for the same acceleration increase, which is true.  But the phrase ""the rich are getting richer"" is actually talking about the fact that the acceleration is actually higher for the rich - they can get a 10% increase in wealth per year, were as a middle-class person might only get 3% for their tiny investment.",1294767593

That's highly contradictory to a bulk of medical wisdom out there.</i><p>""Medicinal plants contain a wide array of chemical compounds. At first, this looks like chaos, but more investigation reveals a distinct order. Natural selection pressures push a plant to ""try out"" variations on molecules to enhance the plant's odds of surviving stressful environments. So, often, one molecule is present in the greatest amount and has the most dramatic effect in a human body -- but along with it are variations of that molecule in the same plant.<p>For example, for several years, I did ethnobotanical study in South America, researching native uses for coca leaf, which most of us know only as the source of the isolated, problematic, addictive drug cocaine. For Andean Indians, whole coca leaf is the number one medicinal plant. They use it to treat gastrointestinal disturbances; specifically, for both diarrhea and constipation. From the perspective of Western pharmacology, this makes no sense. Cocaine stimulates the gut, it increases bowel activity, so obviously it would be a good treatment for constipation, but what could it do for diarrhea except make it worse?<p>However, if you look carefully at the coca leaf's molecular array, you find 14 bioactive alkaloids, with cocaine in the greatest amount. While cocaine acts as a gut stimulant, other coca alkaloids can have precisely the opposite action, they inhibit gut activity.<p>This means that when you take the whole mixture into the body, the potential is there for the action to go in either direction. What decides it? The state of the body, which is a function of which receptors in the gut's tissues are available for binding. During my time in Andean Indian communities, I collected many reports about whole coca's paradoxical, normalizing effect on bowel function, and experienced it firsthand, as well.""<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-weil-md/why-plants-are-usually-be_b_785139.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-weil-md/why-plants-are-...</a>",1294766646

It's natural to see wage stagnation if the financial sector continues to skim off the top of productive industry.<p>And finally- the prices of education and healthcare mentioned by the author are most definitely tied to loose monetary policy that benefits the financial sector.  While some of these costs aren't measured in core inflation, inflation is still happening, the end result being that people make the same but have to pay more to send their kids to school, take care of their health problems, eat food, drive cars...",1294766096

I don't think they tell the whole story.<p>In particular, over a person's working life they'll typically increase income by gaining experience and probably jump jobs a few times for a pay raise, particularly early in the career.<p>Consider that college student with a summer job or the waitress putting herself through school; they will be part of the income statistics for ""no degree"" but clearly the lack of a degree isn't necessarily holding that person back.  The fact that they've chosen to go to school rather than work full time hurts their income.<p>If that's not clear, consider two people, one who graduates high school and becomes an electrician, and another who has a part time job and goes to college.  They're both included in the high-school graduate category before the student graudates, and the student's income drags the statistic down.<p>Now the student graduates and immediately gets a job with a salary on par with the electrician.  Even though they're now making the same amount of money, the statistics show the ""no-degree"" person is far worse off.<p>It seems there's a significant demographic bias at play here.  Arguing that a specific person is likely to benefit financially from getting a degree based on that data seems wrong.<p>And the salary chart doesn't include the opportunity cost of not working during the time it takes to get a degree, or the actual cost in tuition, etc.",1294765219

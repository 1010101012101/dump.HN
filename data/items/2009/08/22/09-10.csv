Would this be a sensible thing to do?<p>What would some examples of ""good"" programming language names be? Most languages I can think of have names from {English words} or existing proper nouns and so <i>any</i>  non new name has a potential to clash on  doing a web search at least till the language name becomes popular enough to rise to the top.<p>Do we really want new computer language authors  to create nonsense phrases as names for their languages?",1250935003

Crufty systems to rip out and replace with frameworks, databases which were being shared across applications, data migration (I feel your pain), etc.<p>On the plus side, after you get good at using a framework, you tend to accumulate a lot less debt.  The downside is that your first project with a framework probably incurs more debt than you would otherwise, although if ""otherwise"" is a using a home-brewed flat-file DB you might come out net positive anyhow. ;)<p>I've ripped out almost 70% of the code that was in the first commit for the Rails version of the Bingo Card Creator over the years.  (I did not know you could serialize an array in the database, so instead, I wrote it to a ... home-brewed flat-file DB...)",1250933166

779177,comment,778593,779155,0,0,gruseom,,,"It seems that the fact that Lisp is a parse tree is what makes it a limiting case. That is, if there's only one canonical structure for representing programs, and Lisp makes it explicit, then any other language that makes it explicit is going to be isomorphic to Lisp.<p>I'd like to know, though: <i>is</i> that true? Is an abstract syntax tree the only good way to represent programs as data? Has any other expressive way to do this been invented, or do programs always boil down to an AST after the syntax has been stripped away?<p>I say ""expressive"" because I can think of at least one other code-as-data representation: binary. But that isn't suitable for programming. If there is another representation that <i>is</i> suitable, but isn't isomorphic to a parse tree, then presumably one could derive from it an analog to Lisp that doesn't simply reduce to Lisp. Until then, though, I think the point that PG made semi-jokingly in the essay, that any language as powerful as Lisp will be a variant of Lisp, has to hold true.<p>Some day I'd like to research this question (or better, someone on HN could just tell me the answer). If other meaningful representations are possible, surely some must have been invented by now. And if they aren't, then the AST is a considerably more remarkable discovery than people realize.",1250931784

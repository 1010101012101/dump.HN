64567,comment,64475,64534,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"As ridiculous as things have got here with the welfare state and the size of government, the problem is much worse in Europe.  There is just no way they can continue to afford the government payrolls and social benefits they have.<p>The US has a chance of navigating out of the failing socialist systems.  The cultural heritage of individual independence and government mistrust means it's possible.  But Europeans exhibit nothing but obstinate rigidity, even with a more serious problem.  It's a ticking fiscal time bomb.",1191804945
64566,comment,64475,64563,0,0,shawndrost,,,"""if you never have a trade deficit after a surplus, that would mean your country is full of money that it never converts into useful wealth.""<p>My original question suggested a way to turn that money into wealth -- buy real estate, stocks, etc in other countries.  (This is, from what I understand, what actually happens -- more productive countries buy parts of less productive countries, in effect.)  Actually, I think there are only two possible answers to my question: first, that purchases of real estate, etc, are included in any analysis of trade.  (This would mean my question is just a misunderstanding of what a ""trade surplus"" is.)  Second, that Hume was wrong, and that a country  can maintain a trade surplus.<p>Now that I think about it that way, I'm almost certain the answer is the first.",1191804755

64564,comment,64475,64563,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> if you never have a trade deficit after a surplus, that would mean your country is full of money<p>Don't be ridiculous.  The surplus can be invested overseas to buy up foreign competitors and suck away the profits, creating even more trade surplus.  The surplus can be invested in creating higher margin export industries domestically, again growing the surplus.",1191804253

64562,comment,64475,64530,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> giving up their stuff they get money, which has only one use: getting some stuff back later<p>It's not just for ""getting stuff back.""  It's capital.  It can be used to buy up or create dividend producing assets.  Nations that accumulate capital can invest it, and through the magic of compounding interest and capital investment they can race ahead of competitors.<p>> countries with trade deficits are like new companies that get a loan and go do something useful with it<p>This way of thinking is so at odds with historical reality I need to know where you encountered it.  Every great and ascendant nation has run consistent trade surpluses.  Nations with trade deficits are either banana republics or headed that way.<p>The US trade deficit is not from imported capital goods.  The US imports consumer products.<p>The US now runs a trade deficit with every region of the world.  The US has a net trade imbalance in every category of industrial/scientific machinery and high-tech products.<p>Sorry, there is no way to spin trade deficits as positive.",1191803405

64560,comment,64536,64554,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I guess ideally each person would contribute something valuable to the team (maybe something the others dont have), making the even 1/3 split justified. The person you talk about would be contributing their domain knowledge.<p>If one persons contribution is low to point that an even split couldn't be justified, then I would just make sure that you really need them as a co-founder, as apposed to an early employee. If things are close though I would try to justify the even split so everyone is on the same plane.<p>In my opinion its just not worth getting greedy over small percentages, if it could compromise the success of the team or cause internal strife. The following quote comes to mind: ""I'd rather have a slice of the watermelon than a whole grape.""<p>",1191802880

It is hard enough to find co-founders as it is, so I figure giving away my idea for free is the price I have to pay to convince other people to join me. Hopefully we will still all get rich, so who cares. <p>It would annoy me if the co-founders were less dedicated to the idea than I am. In that case I would try to negotiate more equity from the beginning. ",1191801666

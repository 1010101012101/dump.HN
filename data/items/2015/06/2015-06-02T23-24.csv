As noted, they are merely functions which return either 1 or 0, True or False. They represent sets by examining their argument and returning True if and only if the set they represent contains that thing.<p>So, if x is a characteristic function and (x x) is True, then x &quot;contains&quot; itself. Then N is just negation, so if N (x x) is True then x does not &quot;contain&quot; itself. That much is simple.<p>Now we form a special new characteristic function, R, defined as<p><pre><code>    R x = N (x x)
</code></pre>
When is (R x) True? Exactly when x is &quot;contained&quot; in R. When does that happen? When N (x x), e.g., when x does not &quot;contain&quot; itself.<p>So this is a well-defined characteristic function and therefore represents what we might think is a well-defined set.<p>But what happens when we check (R R), i.e. to see if R contains itself?<p>Well, R, by definition, contains all things which are not members of themselves. If R is in R then (R R) is True, but then N (R R) is False and (R R) = False. Contradiction!<p>We can inline R into (R R) in order to take a look at the functional form.<p><pre><code>    (\x -> N (x x)) (\x -> N (x x))

and the author notes that this is the same form as the Y-combinator with its first argument specialized to N.<p><pre><code>    Y f = (\x -> f (x x)) (\x -> f (x x))

When nuclear power first started becoming popular light water reactors were easier to make and their fuel/byproducts aligned with the production of nuclear weapons. As years went on regulation and inertia did a great job of cementing us into our old ways. Today, advances in (material) science have made producing molten salt reactors more feasible. They also seem more attractive now that the public is generally very adverse to nuclear waste and power plant failures. I&#x27;m paraphrasing what was explained to me so someone that knows more please chime in.<p>Kirk Sorensen has been a major advocate of molten-salt reactors and gave a great Google tech talk on the subject.

Revealing those public keys has potentially given attackers months/years to try to factor them offline.  If the public keys were not known, Github would have a chance (and hopefully does) of rate-limiting brute-force attacks.  Heck, even if Github is doing nothing to help against brute-forcing, just hiding public keys might make the bandwidth costs more infeasible than the cost of factoring a known public key.",1433286155

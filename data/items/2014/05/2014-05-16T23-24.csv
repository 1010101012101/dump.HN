However, I also upvoted Michael himself, because I thought his description of the system itself was <i>also</i> right-on.  People can be aware of how systems work while still falling victim to those particular dynamics themselves.  And on Hacker News, we try to critique the ideas themselves rather than the people behind them.<p>FWIW, in my own personal experience, most of the guys I went to college with were not misogynists.  Most of them actually seemed pretty nerdy, with both men and women alike enjoying LARPing, duct-tape swordplay, D&D, and board games...and another group that enjoyed sailing and Kings...and another group that was all about music and arts...and another group that was all into technology & philosophy.  This is probably a reflection of who I am.  There were one or two people I can think of who <i>were</i> misogynist assholes, but I didn&#x27;t really hang out with them much, besides reading about them in the school newspaper or hearing an exasperated sigh that mentioned them.<p>I also have not met many truly horrible people in the workforce, so I suspect that is also selection bias.  I&#x27;m sure they exist; I just don&#x27;t work for companies or teams where they make up a majority, I usually can sense them in the interview process and steer clear, or quit and find a new job if they start popping up.",1400284701

In the simple case, say you as a developer build a new widget for the organization&#x27;s website. You finish it, feel chuffed, and move on.<p>One month later, the organization needs something new added to it, or there&#x27;s a security vulnerability in the tool you used to build it which needs to be patched, or the API the widget was connecting to got upgraded and it&#x27;s stopped working.<p>The organization now has three options:<p>- Hope for another volunteer who can come along and fix the thing which was broken. Hint - this never happens. Tech volunteers almost always want to offer their skills on greenfields projects or exciting extensions to functionality, not mundane business-as-usual work.<p>- Pay a consulting company to make the change for them. This gets very expensive very fast, because <i>consulting company</i>.<p>- Stop using whatever you built in the first place. This often has huge business implications by this point, because having trained everyone how to use this new tech you now have to take a step backwards and stop using it. Instant resentment of the system which put this in place.<p>As annoying as it is as developers that we can&#x27;t volunteer our services for a few weeks then disappear, that&#x27;s just not how IT systems work. A system is not finished until it&#x27;s been retired or replaced by something else, and if you&#x27;re providing something to a non-profit which does not have an in house IT team to manage the software through the rest of its lifecycle, you&#x27;re basically donating a liability.<p>Even if that&#x27;s not the case, you&#x27;re dealing with people who don&#x27;t necessarily view or understand technology the way that you do. You could spend several months building what you think they need, then you come back and they say they wanted something else, or some substantial modification to what you&#x27;ve built. You don&#x27;t have time to dedicate to it any more, they don&#x27;t have what they want, and both parties go away dissatisfied.<p>I&#x27;m saying this as a developer who has been involved with several non-IT non profits, including my current one which I&#x27;ve been working with for over 6 years now. I frequently do volunteer dev work for that project, but even the most self-sustaining piece of software I ever set up for them still needs someone to go in there once a year or so and apply software patches and security fixes, and every six months or so their requirements change in some way or another and I have to dive back in to accommodate. &quot;Three month&quot; volunteers are almost always much less help then you would expect them to be.",1400284088

In return for strict adherence to its philosophy, it promises to possibly help you create a better designed and more reliable system over the long run. Some cool cats are using Jabberwocky, many more denounce it. Some studies claim it&#x27;s at least not harmful, others say it&#x27;s a bureaucratic add-on.<p>Meanwhile, you mostly deal with small, simple, or short-lived systems and have little expectation in building skyscraper enterprise apps, so the promised benefits fall in the &quot;oh that&#x27;s nice&quot; bucket. Or perhaps you lead a team that is deeply invested in a three-year codebase not using Jabberwocky, and the cost of getting everyone to switch has a serious financial implication.<p>The stance of &quot;Jabberwocky sounds nice enough, but I do wonder if anyone systematically proved it is worthwhile&quot; is a perfectly valid position. It is not about what you <i>should</i> do, it is about what you <i>can</i> do, and you can&#x27;t just follow every trend (also see: Agile+XP) or even trial every alternative. For many non-engineering firms, there is &quot;real work&quot; to be done, and the never-ending increasingly expensive pursuit of operational excellence <i>can</i> be a hard thing to sell internally.<p>This is a huge benefit of science of the rest of us - a few million people can experiment on the edge of what is known, most of them will get nowhere, but a few thousand will determine that &quot;X448YAB&quot; tends to be superior to &quot;X28YNB&quot;.

I even uninstalled and re-installed chrome to no avail.\nI tried booting into safe mode to do some troubleshooting, and guess what, my computer got stuck in safe mode and would not boot back in normal mode.

Function argument pattern matching ought to be enough.<p>2. The retry options mechanism is somewhat limited - the options seem to apply only at the raise point itself (disclaimer: I&#x27;ve only had a quick glance at ribol). It is more useful to have multiple retry options at different scopes so you can partially unwind, try something, if that doesn&#x27;t work unwind some more (perhaps involving cleanup), try something else, etc.<p>I think muSE&#x27;s design is better on both these fronts.",1400281605

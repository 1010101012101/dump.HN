215478,comment,215367,215367,0,0,lowkey,,,"If you truly believe the patent would be valuable - e.g. a blocker patent excluding competitors from a valuable opportunity - then it really is worth seeking patent council.<p>Releasing establishes a prior art date for US patent purposes and starts a 12 month window within which you can file. Releasing your product publicly may mean giving up your rights in certain countries for a global patent filing.<p>However if your innovation would not be obvious to a user of the product, then releasing may not even constitute disclosure.<p>Like I said, get some professional patent advice. It probably won't even cost you anything for an initial consultation.",1213228167

Our company is based in NYC and you're right about VCs not talking to you if you don't already have a concrete business model that's already generating revenue. However, it seems from my experience that the west coast is a completely different world. I'm sure there are many good reasons for this, but I wouldn't say that most VC's/investors won't talk to you, I would say that most NYC investors won't talk to you.",1213228131

The point is that no one does: 2-300 people, or more, were involved in writing the software you're about to run as root.  It's a huge amount of code, and no one can even pretend to have audited all of it for security issues.  And, in point of fact, vulnerabilities are discovered in this stuff all the time.<p>Running that stuff as root is just dumb.  If linux attracted even a tenth as much attention from black hats as does windows, and you did anything non-trivial (e.g. surfing) with that box, you would be more or less guaranteed to see it rooted at some point.  So the desktop developers, being responsible about this stuff, are trying to warn you.  You are just choosing not to listen.<p>Like I said: you're wrong.",1213227123

If you ask more than two or three questions (username, password, optional email address), then your signup process is crappy and needs to be fixed.  Do you require all posts to parse a CAPTCHA?  Once during signup is probably enough--it's certainly enough until you have a spam problem to deal with.  Do you make people agree to a long ""terms of service""?

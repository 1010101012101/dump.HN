3458688,comment,3446056,3450888,1,0,jtheory,,,"I understand your points, I think -- you're talking far more about <i>taste</i> than about <i>ethics</i>.<p>""Ethics"" is about right and wrong -- what actions harm people on the whole, and what actions help them, why and how.<p>It's not directly related to obeying the law, or following rules.  Making decisions that greatly help the general public at the expense of a massive corporation, especially if those actions carry risk (like the risks that come with breaking laws)... that's easily interpreted as highly ethical.  I certainly don't know enough about Niel to make any judgements about his ethics either way, but your examples here don't show unethical behavior.<p>It's actually <i>more</i> ethical if he lowers his own image (by breaking strong taboos) to talk about things that need to be talked about (I'm thinking of his comments about executive lifestyles...).<p>As a counter-example -- think about the ethics of being a corporate industry leader, and always acting perfectly refined, but still actively screwing your customers as much as you can -- charging far more than your costs, tricking them with hidden & confusing charges, making it extremely difficult for them to get customer support or even to end their contract...  is that ethical?",1326416294

As tech people we have the ability to create stuff that other 'mere mortals' find  amazing and useful. You should think about that more.. not just that but find a problem and solve it. \nAbout being your own man it starts from within you and is not just something that happens to you. If you started a business you'd depend on your clients. As Ceo you are answerable to the board- they'd be hoping you dont screw things up. So it never ends.. things important to us will always be in the hands of others- also we need to give them what is important to them by solving problems. You are free first  from within!! Good luck!!",1326416068

I've spent the past 4 months working on an Android project and when I opened this page I was in shock.<p>Everything looks so awesome and shiny - but where is the actual implementation? Is this stuff just a ICS theme (I haven't used it myself as our app is in 2.2 land)?<p>Others pointed out to check the ""Developer"" link - but that is just the standard Android docs I've been digging through for months already. Searching for things like ""Index Scrolling"" (which would be awesome to add to an app) or ""Switches"" doesn't return anything useful - so what are the Building Blocks and how do I get them into my app?<p>This page should either a) include demos (or links to the demos if they exist already) or b) be embedded in the code docs (android.widget.GridView should show the screenshot and UI guidelines).",1326413699

3458561,comment,3457946,3458192,4,0,russell_h,,,"The problem is that the ""Back"" button has replaced onscreen upward navigation in Android apps. This means that the back button cannot function strictly as a means of returning to your previous activity if upward navigation is going to be possible. The options are for apps to build upward navigation into their UI (how its done on the web) or for apps to push their entire navigation tree onto the stack, regardless of how you get to a given location. Google seems to be opting for the latter option.",1326413556

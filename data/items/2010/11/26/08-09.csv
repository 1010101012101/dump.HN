1941948,comment,1941816,1941816,0,0,roel_v,,,"Can a parent with children at the age where they're capable of learning how to program chime in on how realistic this is? I mean I know that prospective and recent parents have grand dreams of how they'll spend weeks on end educating their child on how to avoid all the traps in life they themselves have fallen into (I'll be a dad in Feb, I know <i>I</i> do - and so do my friends who are in similar positions); daydreaming basically about teaching our children to become <i>us</i> as fast and efficiently as possible (where <i>us</i> is a moving target, of course).<p>The rational part of me thinks it's fruitless though - children at those ages aren't interested in abstract things like this unless there is an innate drive, and in that case you won't have to teach much at all anyway. Of all the people I know who are very good at something and who have older children, none of those children has an interest in their parent's area of expertise. And let's face it, programming is a very small and deep niche; as much as we'd like to tell ourselves that the world revolves around software, it doesn't, even if it powers most of the tools and things we use every day. The chance that our children will have the same interest in programming that we have is very small, it seems to me.",1290761864

The consensus is still, largely, that you can't do it.

We're pretty sure that some problems that do have fast serial algorithms don't have efficient parallel algorithms (this is akin to P vs NP type questions, and is beyond my current knowledge) and these problems are stalled at uni-processor speeds.<p>Research continues, progress is made, and most people don't care because most people just write emails, use facebook and browse the web.  Heavy computing with parallel or multi-processor machines is hard in general, and that's not changing fast.<p>I don't expect it to.

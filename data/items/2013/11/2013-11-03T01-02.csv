6661792,comment,6659874,6660936,4,0,csandreasen,,,"I&#x27;ll try to clarify since I&#x27;m being downmodded...<p>I&#x27;ve argued for some time that <i>how</i> the NSA is collecting is not nearly as important as <i>who</i> and <i>why</i>.  The initial disclosure about the cell phone metadata was a legitimate call for concern - I agree with everyone on that.  The cause for concern there wasn&#x27;t <i>how</i> they were gathering the data, it was that they were collecting on US citizens and we didn&#x27;t know <i>why</i>.  They left those questions to be answered by the administration, who has published a good deal of detail on the Section 215 collection program[1].  If their explanation is innacurate, then the ball is back in the media&#x27;s court to pull evidence showing so from that collection of 50,000 documents that Snowden gave them.  Meanwhile, Congress is continuing to debate this collection now.<p>My issue is with most of the other reporting.  Most of the other leaks so far have revealed <i>how</i> - PRISM, XKeyScore, the Google/Yahoo collection, etc.  What the media outlets have failed to do is show evidence linking this back to collection against ordinary citizens.  Articles that would be more accurately titled something like &quot;The NSA collects vast amounts of data using X&quot; instead are presented as &quot;The NSA collects vast amounts of Americans&#x27; data using X&quot;. They conflate collection authorities and present it as fact to the audience. For example, the NSA is permitted by law (under certain interpretations - the EFF is looking to challenge this in court) to collect American cell phone metadata under Section 215, but is expressly forbidden from collecting American data under FAA 702 authorities. Leaked slides show that the PRISM program is their mechanism for collecting FAA 702 data. Any article claiming that the NSA is collecting such-and-such data against Americans but then goes on to cite PRISM as evidence is conflating the evidence.<p>The <i>how</i> matters to the people being targeted.  The <i>who</i> and <i>why</i> matters to everyone regardless of targeting.  If there is evidence linking these other programs back to collection against ordinary citizens, we need to know.  If we are being targeted, we need to know the how to protect ourselves.  What we&#x27;ve been getting, though, is descriptions of collection programs with &quot;they&#x27;re probably using this to collect on everyone!&quot; sprinkled into the description.  If these programs are only used to target legitimate foreign intelligence targets, then what have we ordinary citizens gained by knowing how?  In revealing this, what have those being targeted learned and how does that affect national security, diplomacy, etc.?<p>If you read through the whole 7 pages of this article, they talk a good deal about who is being targeted and why; discuss the successes and failures, hint at what intelligence has had valuable impact and what hasn&#x27;t; talk about the immense funding and bureaucratic stumbling blocks that has led to an excess of collection that has never been and may never be analyzed; etc., and do so in a manner that the administration says will not affect ongoing operations.  I stand by my statement that this is important information that the public needs in order to ask informed questions to their elected representatives.  I would ask why it took this many months to surface, and why it didn&#x27;t come from The Guardian or the Washington Post, who have had this information for much longer.<p>If you disagree with me, I invite you to state your reasons why and continue with the conversation rather than downvote.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/document/administration-white-paper-section-215-patriot-act"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/document/administration-white-paper-sect...</a>",1383443394

The idea is to allow <i>some</i> limited forms of generic programming while keeping the type system simple enough that it doesn&#x27;t impose significant overhead during JIT compilation. Another advantage, is that it allows the JIT compiler to generate type-specialized code, which offers a significant performance advantage for unboxed value types.<p>The F# type system is a little more powerful, though anything it offers beyond what the CLR officially supports gets erased when the program is compiled (e.g., unit-of-measure types). See: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd548046.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd548046.asp...</a><p>One interesting thing I&#x27;ve realized recently is that F# could potentially support GADTs in the future, just like Haskell and OCaml. The hard part -- the GADT type inference -- would take place at compile time, so there shouldn&#x27;t be any problems encoding the result (the inferred type) in the CLR&#x27;s type system.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in type systems (and as a Haskeller, I imagine you are), there&#x27;s also F* -- it&#x27;s a dependently-typed variant of F# which is being used for verification research at MSR: <a href=""https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fstar/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fstar/</a>",1383443276

I know very little classical greek, but here&#x27;s an example from Latin:<p>malum - adjective, &quot;bad&quot;<p>maalum - noun, &quot;apple&quot; (I&#x27;ve written the long &#x27;a&#x27; as two &#x27;a&#x27;s, which is not normal practice).<p>Contrastive vowel length is a very normal language feature; consider modern Japanese.<p>> I wanted to double check on this belief, and thought about it while listening to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot; (which was already playing) and Stanford&#x27;s Magnificat in G to add a different genre, in both cases the emphasis is often on different syllables to how we would speak it if we just saw the text without knowing the music.<p>Modern songs and (especially) poetry vary in quality in how well the natural rhythm of their language fits the rhythm they&#x27;re set to (there&#x27;s no particular reason to believe that this only occurs in the modern day).  It&#x27;s definitely true that there&#x27;s a lot of material that doesn&#x27;t do that well, but I personally find that sort of thing jarring, and ovrwhelmingly the rhythm of the language and the rhythm of the piece are compatible.  Given a large enough corpus, it&#x27;s quite possible to figure out what rhythm(s) a word really wants to have.<p>Finally, remember how I said that marking vowel length in writing was not normal practice at the time?  You might be interested to know that we know the vowel lengths in Latin words <i>from</i> their use in poetry.<p>Fun side note -- there&#x27;s a famous Latin poet called Ovid; his name in Latin is Ovidius (four syllables: O-vi-di-us).  All of those vowels are short.  The last syllable is easily malleable, as it&#x27;s a case ending, but the fact that the three syllables before it are all short means that Ovid is always referred to in poetry by a nickname, since Latin poetry essentially never allows for three short syllables in a row.",1383442779

The equivalent Powershell code would look like this:<p><pre><code>  7zip a archive.zip folder

Pretty much exactly the same, since in both cases the shell isn&#x27;t doing anything other than invoking a standalone executable.

Compare that to your Powershell example, and I think you&#x27;ll agree that the .NET API is nicer to use (heh, don&#x27;t say that very often). But to return to the subject, how do you zip a folder in Bash? YOU CAN&#x27;T. Bash can&#x27;t zip folders. It can&#x27;t call libraries that can zip folders. It can only invoke programs that can zip folders. And any shell, even the wretched cmd.exe, can do that.<p>I have plenty of problems with Powershell but it is by far the best effort at a shell that the world has yet seen. I come from a Linux background and when asked what I like about working on Windows, I reply with &quot;well, it&#x27;s got a nice shell.&quot; Usually gets me a weird stare, but if we&#x27;re really comparing shells to shells (and not shells to a wide variety of standalone utilities) then Powershell blows everything else out of the water.",1383442419

He writes lots of things that sound good, but aren&#x27;t actually true.<p>For example:<p><i>In fact, there are lots of great reasons for bloatware:  For one, if programmers don&#x27;t have to worry about how large their code is, they can ship it sooner. And that means you get more features, and features make your life better (when you use them) and don&#x27;t usually hurt (when you don&#x27;t).</i><p>Every single part of that statement is false. Your programmers <i>should</i> be worrying about how large their code is. If they&#x27;re not, and your competitors are, then your competition will release a program that does everything your program does, but better and faster. So what if they&#x27;re a couple months (or even a few years) behind? First mover advantage is relatively short-lived, anyway. Microsoft Word wasn&#x27;t the first word processor and Microsoft Excel wasn&#x27;t the first spreadsheet. Google wasn&#x27;t the first search engine. Facebook wasn&#x27;t the first social network.<p>As far as more features being helpful when you use them and harmless when you don&#x27;t, well, that&#x27;s inaccurate too. I find it very ironic that he uses Excel as his poster child for this, since the addition of features has absolutely hurt Excel&#x27;s usability. These days, Excel is a tool that&#x27;s comparable to vim or emacs. It&#x27;s very powerful, but it has a ferocious learning curve to match. Moreover, he overlooks the fact that more features mean more bugs. I think the success of various web-based, minimalist tools has shown that users are quite willing to accept fewer features, if the features that are present work flawlessly.<p>And even the points that were true as of publication (e.g. ever shrinking prices for CPU cycles and RAM) are no longer true today. If you&#x27;re writing code today, CPU cycles are definitely not free. You get roughly 4 billion cycles per core per second on a desktop, and somewhere between 1 and 2 billion if you&#x27;re on a mobile device. Memory is slightly less constrained, but it&#x27;s rare for desktops to ship with more than 8 GB of RAM, and it&#x27;s unheard for mobile devices to have more than 1 or 2.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think bloatware is a &quot;mental health problem&quot;. I think it&#x27;s a real issue, and one that&#x27;s only going to get worse as we run into the limits of Moore&#x27;s Law.",1383440675

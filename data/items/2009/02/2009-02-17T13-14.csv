484489,comment,483740,483740,0,0,voidpointer,,,"Since when is it necessary for a color to be generated by a single wavelength of electromagnetic radiation?
A good way to look at colors their perceptual relationships such as complimentary color is the color wheel used in the HSL and HSV color models. Magenta is at 324° by the way; that's between red and blue (more towards red). Going to the opposite side of the color wheel (324°-180°=144°) gives you (surprise) green, the complementary color to magenta. 
Magenta happens to be the area where the color wheel ""joins"" the opposite ends of the visible electromagnetic spectrum. There is nothing mystical about that fact which explains why greens is the only color that has a complementary color that is not made from a single wavelength.",1234878420

We enjoy pay that's well above the Canadian average (read: we're not working for pennies), and within my family we have 2 masters degrees, 3 undergrads, and 1 soon-to-be PhD.<p>Overall I think we have contributed to raising the Canadian standard of living, instead of detracting from it, and I wish that the US has the foresight to implement these policies - as a startup-minded individual I'd rather be there than here.",1234878280

484480,comment,471660,471660,0,0,learntm,,,"1.Identity is the boundary that separates 'I' from 'non-I'.
2.In order for us to become universal, this boundary must vanish.
3.It is the 'I' that is the doer of anything we do,so this 'I' needs to be expanded rather than contracted. 
4.When the the 'I' expands, ultimately it can include everything within it's fold and the boundary can be pushed  off to infinity, for all practical purposes making it vanish
5.The way to do it is by experiencing our essential 'self' or consciousness, the sub -stratum of all our thoughts through a natural meditation technique like TM.
6.With practice, we can learn to live the boundless even while acting within the boundaries.
7.This will allow any amount of differentiation at the level of thought and action while keeping all differences integrated and mutually supportive.",1234877742

484455,comment,482257,482503,0,0,ideamonk,,,"Hey Zhang Rui, you're not alone, such a situation would soon arrive in India too. Recession is just another catalyst, for such way of thinking, to become popular here in India -- where opportunities aren't abundant and education system has been sleeping for years.
The child of scarcity of opportunities and avenues -- Competition -- about which so many people speak with pride. The word which gives us a false sense that after its occurance, the outcome will be pure gold! The word which kills aapasi bhai chara and life at large. The reason for so many stressed out people in 20-30 years of age... and I guess what not. Anyways coming back to my point, I think competition is the main m&*#^# reason behind all this. And the reason behind the competition is the layed back approach towards education that our government has been adopting and the way we have been giving respect to the ones who get good ranks in a competition.
We just keep forgetting that we as human beings we do, and yes we do, all of us, me you and everyone have the ability to learn things we like, to make changes to things around us to suit our needs, to devise better ways to do things, to create things, to do anything that we want. Now what fuck up competition does is that it puts a force, a palm on your back push you, all of you towards one direction. Now that is fundamentally wrong! You can't have the best outputs from me when you won't let me do what I want. And not everyone knows what one wants at ONE particular age. This introduction to competition at early youthful ages is the biggest fuck up of our life. Our education system is trying to hide its fallacies and fallouts under name of Competition and little are they aware that they are actually taking away our little right to do what we feel like at whatever time we want.
I know my thoughts haven't been presented in an organized manner, loads of you might just say wtf is he trying to say.
So go n relieve yourselves of the doubts and take a lesson, for if you enter the education ministry by your bad luck, your groundnut sized brains would also contain these ideas and with your rice grain sized heart, you would think, and not just think like they have been thinking after independence, you would rather DO something good for my kids, cousins and fellow young citizens who are yet to be born.",1234875648

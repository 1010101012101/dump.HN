2075491,comment,2075235,2075356,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Do you use the Store and iDevice syncing parts of it at all? The Store always has me running around in circles unless I know exactly what I'm after and can search for it directly. The back button and breadcrumbs often behave contrary to expectation, and for some reason there only is a global search. The store also seems excruciatingly slow; I assume the servers are all located in North America and the content isn't optimised for transcontinental latencies.<p>iDevice syncing is full of unhandled corner cases which lead to crashes, inconsistent state, nonsense error messages, or lost data. It's also really easy to accidentally delete stuff off your device if you don't have the same data locally. I probably get the short end of the stick for being a developer: iTunes and XCode have a kind of love-hate relationship. That's far from the only source of problems though, I've seen all kinds of weirdness outside the context of iOS development.<p>Even outside of this, there are some embarrassing hiccups, e.g.:<p>- The UI becomes extremely unresponsive while importing media - it seems the import runs in the UI thread, or otherwise causes the UI thread to block.<p>- If you're editing metadata for a file while it's playing, there's a brief pause while saving.<p>There's no excuse for either of those, and seem the sort of thing a decent programmer with knowledge of the codebase could fix in a day or so.

It completely blows the on screen keyboard out of the water, but I was never that fast at that. I was a major fan of hardware keyboards before swype (in fact, it's why I got a Droid instead of another Android phone), but I'm beginning to find myself becoming faster on Swype than an actual phone keyboard, and that's even with a 2+ year headstart of using hardware keyboards.<p>However, this all depends on the size of the tablet. If it was laptop sized (with Fn keys to allow for slightly smaller size even), I'd probably take the keyboard over Swype, but it would really depend on where I was typing. Swype is designed to be used one handed, and would be perfect for when you can't just set your tablet down.

After a bunch of research, I convinced myself that it might be true. Iwas officially diagnosed in August and have been on drugs since then. So it is early days for me...<p>The plan for me is to use the drugs long enough to cement behaviors that help me manage the condition within my current situation. For most of my life, I haven't had a 'straight-job', a marriage and two kids to raise. I structured everything so that I could basically do anything that I wanted, whenever I wanted. Now that I have to manage having family and a job (at least job in the short term), I need to have some way of maintaining consistent behavior. Right now the drugs are working for my situation.<p>I know the thinking-difference that this condition brings is a comparative advantage to others. I am way more creative, and much better at solving problems than others are. I just kind of suck at being reliable right now.<p>Personally, I have no side effects that I notice (none at all) with correct dosing and control of my behavior.<p>Within the first few days of being on Concerta, I had a stressful rush-job on one of my files at work and slipped into my 'work-zone' behavior (my main symptom is overfocus). The combination of the new drugs, and the adrenaline / anxiety was a strange sensation, probably what most experience when being on amphetamines. I just don't put myself in that situation anymore.<p>Other than that, I've nothing to report.<p>You might consider that it was not the drugs alone that were keeping you awake. You may have a great deal of latent anxiety that only becomes a problem once you 'wake your frontal lobe up'. That anxiety is what I used to stay sharp before drugs. Maybe massage or meditation would help you get to sleep  when you start on the drugs.<p>I do not claim to be an authority on the research, but I believe that the statistics are that more people die from using Asprin every year than medical stimulants (not that death should be the only measure).<p>There is evidence supporting good outcomes for the medical use of stimulants dating as far back as the 1930's - longer than any other class of drugs.

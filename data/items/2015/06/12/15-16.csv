9706693,comment,9705830,9706034,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"At my first job, we built I/O cards that did stuff like the Amiga in the article does. The cards used adapters so they could run on anything from TRS80&#x27;s to PC&#x27;s because at the time the system was conceived, the IBM PC hadn&#x27;t emerged as the dominant desktop yet.<p>The company is long out of business, but every so often someone finds some of their products at a garage sale or industrial auction or it comes in a box of other things on eBay. When they search for manuals on the product they often find me because by coincidence someone asked about those products on a forum I frequent and that conversation tends to come up in the first page on google.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how many really old systems are still running after decades without change and no one gives it a thought until something breaks. I&#x27;ve often wished I had a list of their old customers so I could contact them and offer my services to upgrade old controls.<p>[sigh] another business opportunity missed.",1434124765
9706692,comment,9705971,9705971,0,0,chollida1,,,"I&#x27;d say we are.<p>One definition of a bubble that my colleges use is an external force that artificially props up values, or put another way a force that if it was removed would see prices crash.<p>Now consider silicon valley,  what happens when a 2001 scenario happens and venture capital money dries up.  Ask your self the question, if there was no vc money tomorrow would valuations remain the same, probably not.<p>Now that&#x27;s not entirely fair as vc money won&#x27;t just all go away, but then ask is there more vc money now that before, the answer is yes to to tune of about 5x-10x(estimates differ) more than there was in 1999.<p>So a more realistic question would be to ask what happens if we removed 5x-10x the funding that we currently have, would prices go down?<p>The startup market looks alot like the junk bond market in the Milken days.  Junk bonds are very risky bonds but they can pay out alot and as long as there is money to roll the debt over into new debt everyone is happy.  However, if the market gets jitters then suddenly you go from a scenario where everyone can roll their debt to a scenario where almost no one except for hte &quot;best&quot; junk bonds can get rolled( similar to getting vc in 2001-2004).<p>ie a bubble doesn&#x27;t go down gradually, it goes down hard.<p>Another scary thing for valuations that doesn&#x27;t get enough air time is the percentage of gains made when a  company is private vs when its public.  I saw a great tweet when Larry Ellison retired that said something to the effect of final score Oracle shares up 32,000% since it when public.  It will be hard for a facebook to return that kind of return to investors over the next 25 years.<p>It used to be the case that the public markets got alot more of the stock gains than they are getting now.  This should scare people as its the public markets that give companies their valuations.  If the public markets find that stocks aren&#x27;t going to have the 20 year gains that they used to have, then money, being like water, will flow to where it can make better gains, which will depress public market prices, which in turn, will push down private market valuations.<p>This isnt&#x27; a short term trend but one to watch, over the next 10 years.  I know of a few macro based funds that are very concerned about this.<p><i></i>BONUS off the cuff prediction<i></i><p>We will see a private company start to pay dividends rather than go public in the next 3 years.<p>TL/DR \n- private markets value growth, public markets value profits.  You&#x27;ve hit a bubble when you have the largest private companies not being able to produce profits that the public markets expect.  Once that happens everything gets &quot;messed up&quot; with the chain of:<p>- the largest private companies can&#x27;t go public  at their expected valuations leading to<p>- lower valuations for private companies, leading to<p>- existing companies not being able to get teh vc capital they were expecting, leading to<p>- private companies going out of business, leading to<p>- vc losses, leading to less vc money in the system, \nleading to<p>- a &quot;virtuous&quot; cycle that deflates the bubble.",1434124747

9706680,comment,9704596,9706292,0,0,__z,,,">I wonder the same things about cancer and I believe that in the past 50+ years we have identified more types of cancer.<p>I wrote a long post about this a few weeks ago but the long story short is YES! We <i>absolutely</i> have detected more (asymptomatic) cancers with increased screening of healthy people.<p>Here&#x27;s my previous post - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9621249"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9621249</a><p>Here&#x27;s some random links:<p><a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/screening-for-disease-in-people-without-symptoms-the-reality/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/screening-for-disease-i...</a><p><a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-skeptical-look-at-screening-tests/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-skeptical-look-at-scr...</a><p>>Prostate cancer is very common but isn’t always harmful. It is found in 80% of autopsies where the men died of something else. Many more men die with prostate cancer than because of it.<p>>The screening test for prostate cancer is a blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This is not a yes-or-no test. It must be interpreted in the context of the patient’s age and risk factors and the rate of rise, and any cut-off level is arbitrary and will miss some small percentage of cancers. If the PSA test is positive, the next step is biopsy. Typically, 12 needle biopsies are done, 6 on each side. They find cancer in 25% of patients. But if you go back and do more biopsies, you’ll find cancer in 25% more patients. Theoretically, if you could see every cell in the prostate, you might be able to find a cancer cell or two in almost everyone, most of which would never progress or kill the patient. So you have to decide how many biopsies are reasonable. If you find cancer on a biopsy, the next step is treatment, and treatments for prostate cancer are not benign.<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/overkill-atul-gawande"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/overkill-atul-g...</a><p>>we’ve assumed, he says, that cancers are all like rabbits that you want to catch before they escape the barnyard pen. But some are more like birds—the most aggressive cancers have already taken flight before you can discover them, which is why some people still die from cancer, despite early detection. And lots are more like turtles. They aren’t going anywhere. Removing them won’t make any difference.<p>>Over the past two decades, we’ve tripled the number of thyroid cancers we detect and remove in the United States, but we haven’t reduced the death rate at all. In South Korea, widespread ultrasound screening has led to a fifteen-fold increase in detection of small thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancer is now the No. 1 cancer diagnosed and treated in that country. But, as Welch points out, the death rate hasn’t dropped one iota there, either. (Meanwhile, the number of people with permanent complications from thyroid surgery has skyrocketed.) It’s all over-diagnosis. We’re just catching turtles.",1434124675

9706668,comment,9706355,9706355,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"In my opinion the bubbleness will be reflected when the music stops. Back when the dot com bubble burst, the thing I found amazing was that people who had been customers just a month before, vanished. Not into chapter 11 (reorginizational) bankruptcy, but chapter 7 (liquidation). I vividly recall showing up for a meeting with a customer&#x27;s VP of sales at their fancy downtown San Francisco office and getting off at the elevator to an empty floor with a broker taking pictures to put it on the market. From the previous wednesday, &quot;Oh sure, lets talk monday.&quot; to Monday&#x27;s &quot;The previous tenant isn&#x27;t here anymore.&quot; was really startling to me. Almost like the movie trope where the shadowy agency removes its front company over night.<p>For those companies, it was the fact that they were &quot;pre-revenue&quot; and so the only way to keep the lights on was to raise money. And right up until every investor said &quot;No&quot; and they couldn&#x27;t make payroll with the money left in the bank, they operated like a company, and then they weren&#x27;t, For  companies these days that do have revenue, they basically have to try to shrink into a profitable place, which is keep as much of the revenue as possible with the fewest possible people / computers / real estate etc. Then they have a shot of surviving. But contracts like leases you can&#x27;t get out of, can bite you and force you to go into Chapter 11 briefly to renegotiate those contracts.<p>What is unique I think to tech bubbles though is that the developers are often fine when the bubble bursts, they just go to companies that are built on better financials, its the executives that pay the price and have a harder time finding a new job.",1434124625

But the other way around, someone who has used relational databases, will immediately understand formal set theory and find it absolutely trivial. Another example would be regular expressions. Anybody who has ever used them will immediately recognize what Kleene&#x27;s closure is about and effortlessly deal with it. I think that this is generally the case. If you first solve problems with tools that embody a particular theorem, and if later on you read up on that theorem, you will find that theorem trivially simple. In other words, math and computer science are only hard, when you have never used them.

It makes sense to talk about versioning at the component level, but it should rarely apply at the API level.  See this excellent article for further clarification: <a href=""https://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/10/25/web_api_versioning_smackdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/10/25/web_api_versioning_smac...</a>.<p>Versioning an API is a decision by the API provider to let the consumer deal with forward and backward compatibility issues.   I prefer the approach of focusing on the link relations or media type vice URI or some other technique of versioning because it is consistent in the direction (wrt Hypermedia-based APIs) of the link relations as the point-of-coupling for your API, which makes managing and reasoning about changes to your API less complicated.<p>Whenever possible, hypermedia-based media type designers should use the technique of extending to make modifications to a media type design.  Extending a media type design means supporting compatibility.  In other words, changes in the media type can be accomplished without causing crashes or misbehavior in existing client or server implementations.  There are two forms of compatibility to consider when extending a media type: forward and backward.<p>Forward-compatible design changes are ones that are safe to add to the media type without adversely affecting previously existing implementations.  Backward-compatible changes are ones that are safe to add to the media type design without adversely affecting future implementations.<p>In order to support both forward and backward compatibility, there are some general guidelines that should be followed when making changes to media type designs.\n1) Existing design elements cannot be removed.\n2) The meaning or processing of existing elements cannot be changed.\n3) New design elements must be treated as optional.<p>In short favor extending the media type or link relation and focus on compatibility.  Versioning a media type or link relation is essentially creating a new variation on the original, a new media type.  Versioning a media type means making changes to the media type that will likely cause existing implementations of the original media type to “break” or misbehave in some significant way.  Designers should only resort to versioning when there is no possible way to extend the media type design in order to achieve the required feature or functionality goals.  Versioning should be seen as a last resort.<p>Any change to the design of a media type that does not meet the requirements previously described in are indications that a new version of the media type is needed. Examples of these changes are:\n1) A change that alters the meaning or functionality of an existing feature or element.\n2) A change that causes an existing element to disappear or become disallowed.\n3) A change that converts an optional element into a required element.<p>While versioning a media type should be seen as a last resort, there are times when it is necessary. The following guidelines can help when creating a new version of a media type.\n1) It should be easy to identify new versions of a media type. \na) application/vnd.custom+xml application/vnd.custom-v2+xml\nb) application/custom+JSON;version=1 application/custom+JSON;version=2\nc) <i></i>* REQUEST <i></i>*\nPUT /users/1 HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\nContent-Type: application/vnd.custom+xml Length:xxx\nVersion: 2\n…\n2) Implementations should reject unsupported versions.<p>Hope this helps!",1434123476

Short Instance Lifetimes<p>An idiomatic system running on AWS (with autoscaling, load-balancing, and CloudFormation managing AMI changes to enable <i>immutable infrastructure</i>) has average instance lifetime (much) lower than one month.<p>In my current operation, most instances live a few days at most, many far fewer (some are literally just &quot;background processes&quot; instantiated as whole machines, and terminate themselves when their job is done. When instances are charged by the hour, this costs far less than it would seem!)<p>AWS isn&#x27;t a VPS provider, really. You don&#x27;t use it to run your snowflakes (<a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html</a>). It&#x27;s for building systems, living bodies made out of cells that are created and die without affecting the body as a whole.<p>A pretty valid comparison is that AWS encourages you to use VMs in about the same way that Erlang encourages you to use processes.<p>You might also consider that hosts like Heroku <i>consume</i> AWS and then <i>provide</i> something with monthly fees. When AWS calls itself Infrastructure-as-a-Service, it means it; it&#x27;s not for end-user developers, because end-user developers don&#x27;t need control over infrastructure. AWS is for ops-teams who need to declaratively instantiate an entire virtual data center.<p>If you want to <i>play at being</i> an ops-team (and I&#x27;m not knocking that desire; it&#x27;s fun and educational) you can use AWS for your tiny web-app. But it&#x27;s the wrong fit, precisely because you won&#x27;t <i>need</i> most of what AWS is trying to give you, or have answers to the compromises it wants to know your position on, because those compromises only matter at scale.<p>AWS also has ...<p>2. A Heterogeneous Substrate<p>AWS has both old hardware and new hardware laying around, and both older and newer data centers, and their regions (collections of interlinked data centers) are either over- or under-capacity. The prices are played with to incentivize you to use whatever currently costs AWS the least to give you.<p>The us-east-1 region, for example, is more expensive to launch instances in, mostly because it&#x27;s pretty hard to find more places to put new DCs in the area it&#x27;s in, so they want to prevent everyone from crowding into it (especially given that it&#x27;s the oldest region and the default.)<p>AWS spot instances are another example; if you&#x27;re willing to take whatever people are using the least of on AWS whenever it becomes available, you can boot up an instance for even cheaper than its nominal price, because you&#x27;re running it using machines that would otherwise be (pretty much guaranteed to be) idle.<p>One interesting thing AWS does, is make newer instance types only compatible with newer parts of their computational substrate. AWS never truly <i>deprecates</i> anything: non-VPC instances, 32-bit instances, PV instances, and instances with ephemeral public IPs, are still all there for systems that were designed way back then with those in mind and are expected to stay working. (This is also <i>why</i> us-east-1 is still the default, by the way. Old orchestration scripts assume they&#x27;ll continue to get us-east-1 if they leave the region off. You don&#x27;t want your new instances suddenly sneaking off half-way across the country from your old ones...)<p>But AWS isn&#x27;t gonna bring up any <i>new</i> hardware to run the legacy stuff if they can help it. There are only so many e.g. 32-bit boxes in the AWS DCs, and AWS isn&#x27;t going to allocate more, since one legacy customer moves away from 32-bit instances at about the same rate that some other legacy customer scales up to need more 32-bit instances. So 32-bit instance types (which are all legacy instance types, now) all stay the same price.<p>The new instance-types, meanwhile—like t2.micro or this m4 series—can afford to be cheaper, since they&#x27;re restricted to only launch on the modern parts of the substrate. This means both that they will get cheaper over time (because AWS will continue to grow the modern part of the substrate), and also that they start out cheaper, because the modern designs are more efficient for AWS to run in terms of computational/network overhead, power consumption, cooling, cost of replacement parts, etc.<p>---<p>Anyway, to answer your question, I didn&#x27;t bother with the docs; I used the AWS calculator (<a href=""http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a>). (Side note: it&#x27;s &quot;AWS calculator&quot;, not &quot;EC2 calculator&quot;, for a reason. It&#x27;s <i>very likely</i> some cost other than compute will swamp your compute costs. Bandwidth, for example, or S3 storage, or RDS Postgres instances with provisioned IOPS.)<p>Anyway, in the <i>us-west-2</i> region (a new-ish region with modern DCs), a <i>t2.micro</i> instance (the newest tiny instance type) run <i>on-demand</i> (no prepaid reservation) costs $9.52/mo. The cheapest you can get is a <i>t2.micro</i> run with a <i>3-year upfront reservation</i>: it&#x27;s $4.20/mo, or $151.00 total to get a VM that will sit around for three years.<p>But if you just want to try AWS, all of this is irrelevant: you get a year of hobbyist-grade resources (including e.g. one year of t2.micro instance-hours) for free (<a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/free/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/free/</a>) when you sign up.",1434123415

This is important to my customers, because they typically have planning and modeling work to do, and waiting around for batches just won&#x27;t fly.<p>There are a few ways to get this kind of ad-hoc reporting experience, but the easiest is by directly issuing queries against the data.  For this to be viable, though, you need two things: An expressive data manipulation language and the ability to exercise the hardware.<p>Oracle is the only database that delivers.  Oracle&#x27;s support for modern SQL and its proprietary extensions (e.g., [1]) are incredibly powerful, but they&#x27;re expensive CPU-wise.  However, Oracle will parallelize these, effectively running a single query over n cores.<p>Without those features, I&#x27;d have been building change monitors, data diffing algorithms, solvers, and all of that stuff to support background partial recomputation.  Job runners, queuing, cache invalidation... man, just thinking about all that stuff again makes me realize just how nearly impossible it would have been to get this company off the ground.<p>Also, a note on pricing: it&#x27;s expensive if you need these features, and licensing truly is arcane, but their are some pretty good options now.  Several others have pointed to Oracle&#x27;s free and cheap offerings, like XE and SE1, but Oracle is available on RDS with licensing included.  You can quite literally amortize the licensing cost by the hour and quit anytime, and it&#x27;s nothing more than an option when you provision your instance.<p>All that said, if you really need it, buying a $40k license is an awful lot cheaper than buying a couple $150k engineers to make it work on some other platform.<p>This has really informed my philosophy, especially when doing things on a startup budget.  Get the best tools you can and use the hell out of them for all they&#x27;re worth.  There are thousands of engineer-years behind Oracle, and they&#x27;ve tackled a lot of hard problems for you.  It&#x27;s always a shame when I look at an operation and see people doing suboptimal reimplementations (you did you own materialized view?) because nobody read the docs...<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14223/sqlmodel.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14223/sqlmod...</a>",1434122410

This is a <i>horrible</i> thing to put at the forefront, because it limits your view to the particular set of language constructs you use as opposed to broader properties of computer systems and computation. It is best to start by a rundown of high-level computer architecture (von Neumann and Harvard) so as to understand basic machine instructions and types, progressing into OS fundamentals (something like <i>The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System</i>, though condensed), then briefly into compiler construction and language VMs, onto practical usage of a CLI shell, the various ways of representing resources and IPC, data structures and how to use them in forming basic services (like a message/event broker bus or publish-subscribe with named pipes and the file system under a standard interface/toolkit), build systems and so forth. Ideas and concepts with code on the side.<p>Obviously these are rushed examples, but the point is that code-centric computing education in public schools will probably backfire by creating people with just enough knowledge to have extremely warped views of software. Unless your goal is to turn kids into ALGOL monkeys who can&#x27;t see beyond the mnemonics, I suppose.<p>You might say this would be too complex for public schools to implement.

9706317,comment,9703384,9704630,0,0,geebee,,,"Thanks for going ahead and expressing what you think may be an unpopular point of view.  Your points are fair, and are a bit part of why I feel so ambivalent about technical interviews.  While I don&#x27;t really like how they&#x27;re handled, I think they may be necessary, and they may be an unfortunate byproduct of a good thing.<p>For instance, I majored in math, not CS.  I took some basic computer science, but much of my programming was done in math classes, sometimes informally, sometimes as part of the course itself, and sometimes as part of those optional 1-2 unit pass/fail labs.<p>When I first opened a data structures and algorithms book, I was slightly amused by what I&#x27;d already covered and what I hadn&#x27;t.  For instance, I&#x27;d written DFS and BFS code for my graph theory class in college, and I&#x27;d done a lot of the linear programming at the end of the algorithms book.  Various numerical programming exercises had touched on a lotos other things, recursion, lists, and so forth.  But there were gaps, and I&#x27;ve studied a lot on my own for them.<p>Now, in most fields that wouldn&#x27;t be possible.  You can&#x27;t study something that overlaps quite a bit with law, nursing, or medicine, and then fill in the gaps on your own, demonstrate knowledge to an employer&#x27;s satisfaction, and go off to work as a lawyer, nurse or physician.  I think this is a pretty wonderful thing about software development, and things like the google &quot;entrance exams&quot; are actually part of why it is possible.<p>I didn&#x27;t get an offer from google, and reading these threads, I&#x27;m realizing that I should have taken months, not weeks, to review.  However, I didn&#x27;t encounter any of the arrogance or hostility, I found that the interviewers did a good job keeping things friendly and collaborative.<p>That said, it&#x27;s stressful.  People in other fields are often kind of astounded to hear what we go through.  You have nowhere to hide, you are at the whiteboard, with a pen, getting grilled technically, and you only have 45 minutes to solve the problem.  You fear looking like an idiot, even if the interviewer tries to be positive.  You may feel like an idiot, even if the interviewer had no intention of making you feel this way and made an effort to make sure you didn&#x27;t.  And of course, there are plenty of interviewers who may actually kind of enjoy making someone squirm a bit.<p>So while I may have a somewhat more positive view of the tech &quot;exam&quot; than a lot of people here, I still think something is broken here.  I&#x27;ve discussed this a few times with people here on HN, and I honestly do think that three big interviews may be roughly equivalent to taking the bar exam.  Seriously.  I could have studied for several months (though like I said, I have bigger gaps to plug than a CS major probably would).  I read a blog post about a guy who passed the California bar with 100 hours of study.  People talk about the &quot;grueling&quot; three days of exams.  Well, interview at google, amazon, and microsoft.  Between phone interviews, in person interviews, and so forth, sure it can get to that level.  Even if it falls short of &quot;bar exam&quot; level effort, the fact that we&#x27;re starting to talk about it reasonably in the same breath shows just how much effort goes into it.<p>And here&#x27;s the problem - it&#x27;s just an interview.  You get no feedback, no credential, nothing.  You might do well enough to &quot;pass&quot; under a reasonable set of scoring criteria, but all you get is a &quot;no hire&quot; with very minimal information about how you did.<p>I&#x27;ve heard people say (again here on HN) that they&#x27;d happily take a bar exam for software if it meant that they could be done, for once and for all, with the never-ending series of technical exams that we have to do over and over.  I&#x27;d be ok with studying three months, six, hell, even a year.  Because the exam would be consistent, rigorous, and would provide me with a lasting credential.  I&#x27;m just not willing to put this sort of effort into a single interview that may be decided very capriciously.<p>So, all in all, I see merit in these difficult technical exams (first step, let&#x27;s stop calling them interviews).  I think the whole thing could be handled vastly better, though.",1434121513

Oh well. This was over a decade ago - now I live in Berkeley, CA; I work as a consultant programmer on various web related projects,  after having done a few startups as a cofounder (none worked out) and at this point the fact that I lived at home during college is no longer relevant - after college I got a job, moved into a four bedroom apartment in Brooklyn NY with a couple of dudes some of whom I knew from high school, and pretty much spent all of my twenties doing what people do for four years in dorms in colleges: coding with my roommate, partying, self-analyzing, making mistakes, building and fucking up relationships, developing various professional and social skills.<p>My advice is probably exactly what you&#x27;d expect a reasonable, more adult and &quot;mature&quot; person on the internet whom you&#x27;ve never met say: don&#x27;t do anything drastic. Finish your college at home, maintain your GPA, see if you can maybe land a job, local or remote, while you are still in school so that you have some money ready to be at your disposal once you graduate. As soon as you graduate, move your ass to a major city that is an epicenter of whatever your career happens to be, and live in a cool neighborhood with lots of other recent grads. Hopefully there will already be people you may know - maybe from high school, maybe from college - this will be your starting point for a social circle. Or if not - there&#x27;s always meetup.com and okcupid.com<p>Good luck, and don&#x27;t worry about missed opportunities. I&#x27;ve missed ten times as many more opportunities in my twenties as I did during college. If I had spent a lot of time thinking about all the things I missed out on in life, I&#x27;d probably put a bullet into myself a long time ago.",1381294451

6519437,comment,6517553,6519144,8,0,malandrew,,,"If that is the case, why stop at child pornography. Physical child abuse like beatings present a far greater threat in terms of children impacted, but we aren&#x27;t discussing the wholesale monitoring of every adult with a child, are we? Are the children that are victims of physical abuse not deserving of the same attention we give to those that are victims of sexual abuse?<p>There are alternatives that mitigate the problem without centralized government involvement and dragnet surveillance. Opting for a law enforcement-based government solution from day one pretty much eliminates all creative thinking on how the damages from child pornography can be reduced to <i>acceptable levels</i>.<p>I emphasize acceptable levels, because the correction of all ills and dangers carries with it diminishing returns. If you want to completely eradicate something, it&#x27;s going to cost you an order of magnitude more to eliminate the last 20% of the problem than the first 80%. Costs here a both financial and freedom-wise. The in both time and freedoms for services (telecoms, etc.) and places (homes, offices, etc.) is good enough for probably 80% of the benefit. Beyond that the cost is just too high for too little benefit.<p>You can also get 80% of the benefit by just identifying the small subset of children that present the highest at risk group and providing special services for the monitoring and social support for that group. No need to drag in the rest of society.<p>First, child pornography itself isn&#x27;t really the problem, but the problem we focus on because its visible and elicits emotions. We focus on the end product, but the root problem is how child pornography is made. Child porn doesn&#x27;t only exist in electronic form. Getting convictions of users of child porn isn&#x27;t going to protect any children. We know undeniably that a market exists. Going after the buy-side is never going to have a meaningful impact, because there are a <i>lot</i> more buyers than creators and the amount of effort to bag a few consumers here and there is a drop in the bucket and will never be sufficient to reduce demand enough that there isn&#x27;t incentive for the supply side to keep producing it. If you make it harder, then the price just go up. Profits don&#x27;t change.<p>Personally, I would like us make the consumption of child pornography legal but keep it illegal to manufacture or distribute child pornography. By keeping the buy side legal, you gain enormous amounts of visibility into the market dynamics that don&#x27;t exist, when you force both sides to go underground making observation difficult enough that the privacy of many innocent people needs to be compromised to make policing even marginally effective. Furthermore, it would still be considered taboo and a sickness and we&#x27;d encourage purveyors of child porn to seek psychiatric care, where we would counsel them on their addiction and show them the damages caused by their consumption. To get access to free psychiatric care, we can solicit cooperation from the buy side in discovering who is operating on the sell side. This removes a lot of trust in that market, because instead of both sides being driven to trust one another for fear from prosecution of the same law enforcement entity, the sell side will end up with a healthy mistrust of their customers.<p>The fastest way to destroy a market is to destroy trust in that market. TBH, I&#x27;m surprised we don&#x27;t really spend any attention on how you effectively undermine markets like we spend time on how to foster liquidity in markets and making them more efficient.",1381293800

Basically, your example assumes that the system has a fundamentally risky design.<p>Even if you need a trusted party in your design, it should be the case that the party only has a limited ability to violate everyone&#x27;s security.  For example, consider an identity-based encryption system, which by its nature requires a trusted party to generate keys.  Under the right circumstances, that party can delete the master secret key needed to generate keys; one can imagine setting things up so that the master secret is destroyed periodically, say once per month, so that only keys that were recently issued can be compromised if the authority is compromised (your identity under such a system might include some information about when your key was issued).<p>&quot;I reject your justification and others which rely on a technical deficiency in Lavabit&#x27;s implementation to endorse the legality and moral authority of the court&#x27;s orders.&quot;<p>I think it would be fantastic to have a trustworthy government, but that is orthogonal to the issue here, because the security of a system like Lavabit is not limited to resisting court orders.  Suppose the Lavabit have become as big as GMail i.e. big enough that the government might threaten an antitrust investigation if special favors were not performed.  Suppose that a foreign government was trying to conduct industrial espionage against Lavabit&#x27;s users, and surreptitiously installed eavesdropping software or equipment.<p>For that matter, suppose that you were personally involved in a lawsuit against Ladar.  Would you communicate with your lawyer using Lavabit in that situation?<p>Also consider the reality that <i>laws can change</i>.  It might take a massive terrorist attack to cause laws to change for the worse.  Maybe a dictator will rise to power.  Maybe people will just stop caring.  Maybe it will be a combination of things, but the point is that building a system that relies on the law to protect users&#x27; rights is a fundamentally bad approach.  It was not merely laws that stopped mass surveillance previously; when letters were sent primarily via the postal system, it was the lack of abundant and automatic copying that prevented mass surveillance.

The reason people are &quot;stuck&quot; is many times because no one is telling or showing them that there are ways out. They are simply mailing them a check to hold them over until the next check. But I know more than a handful of people who got out of the ghetto and welfare situations and it wasn&#x27;t a government program that pulled them out. There was community help, like churches, for instance. But in almost every case they bootstrapped their way out. They started by deciding to be honest. They accepted responsibility. They listened to good advice.<p>When flat broke, what are you going to lose by moving?  What do you have to move?  Not much. Try something, anything.<p>My overarching point is that welfare handouts hurt more people than they help in the long term. They create reliance instead of independence.<p>EDIT: As I thought about this a bit more, I realized your scenario and my point are not that far apart. The 40 year old woman with a high school diploma and 3 kids in your example may not be able to change her own circumstances that easily but she has three little minds that she can mold day after day about rising above those circumstances. Instead, what we usually see is poverty passed on to the next generation. If she accepts poverty as a way of life she is more likely to pass the mindset on to her kids.",1381291798

I definitely agree that many erstwhile &quot;analog&quot; functions have joined the dark side. ;-) And I&#x27;ve been programming digital / analog systems since the early 80s.<p>But I think that two challenges / opportunities remain for analog. The first is that advances in digital capabilities place new demands on analog. For instance, the possibility of higher sampling rates and bit depths requires us to go back and update transducer preamps.<p>Second, some archaic skills can still be lucrative if the number of practitioners decreases faster than the number of remaining applications. I&#x27;m still betting my career on the need for <i>somebody</i> to care about physics, while also knowing how to program. At my workplace, I am possibly the last remaining person who knows how to compute a noise budget that includes transducers, analog signals, and digital processing, in an instrumentation system.<p>Horowitz and Hill had a chapter, &quot;Digital Meets Analog&quot; that discuss ways that digital designers have to keep up with analog concepts.

It&#x27;s only pointing out that &#x27;she&#x27; typically means grammatical female gender that I even think about it.  So when my father would use &#x27;she&#x27; for ships and aircraft I never thought about the pronoun implications. It was only until much later in life and seeing these issues discussed that I saw some oddity in the pronoun usage.<p>That is, in some cases it can be that a non issue is made an issue by bringing attention to it.

That dealer might have an incredibly minimal web site with almost no content -- maybe just contact information.<p>The original link-structure analysis idea in PageRank was meant to address issues like this a little bit: if everybody links to that dealer&#x27;s page, it&#x27;s a good suggestion that that dealer is important, regardless of the content of the page.

8958319,comment,8958192,8958192,0,0,informatimago,,,"Stay with Linux.<p>It&#x27;s really a personnal question, and depends on your preferences on user interface.<p>For example, I prefer the emacs user interface and I use emacs with ratpoison as window manager on X11 on Linux.  I also use emacs on MacOSX (and <a href=""http://www.emacsformacosx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacsformacosx.com</a> is a very good GNU emacs distribution), but I miss the rest of keyboard interaction allowed by ratpoison (which if you stay inside emacs, is not a big deal). I also use X11 on MacOSX.  In my situation, Linux is quite preferable.  On the other hand, since I&#x27;m currently working on a MacOSX application, while I could (and actually did during a period) edit and compile it from the Linux box, I&#x27;m currently using the MacOSX box to work on it (and therefore accessing my Linux workstation thru X11 on MacOSX, since it&#x27;s more convenient than moving around to the Linux box).<p>This later note, to mention that you can have a setup where &quot;the network&#x27;s the computer&quot;, that is, you actually use the workstation at hand just as a window on the whole network.  With a window system like X11, you really get a smooth experience having processes on the various computer on your network displayed on your screen. Then it doesn&#x27;t matter what OS your current computer runs, you are just using X11 apps, running all over the place.<p>And if this is your approach, if you&#x27;re using more a network of computer than a single isolated computer, then consider that (while NeXTstep DisplayPostscript system provided such network independance and indirection), the only window system nowadays providing it is X11 (which you can use on unix as well as on MacOSX or MS-Windows).  Also, and for somebody who uses the keyboard 12 hours a day, I notice that I can more easily configure the layout of the keyboard with X11 than with MacOSX (or worse, MS-Windows), and furthermore, I find that the keyboard is more responsive when processed by X11 than by the MacOSX system, notably in the handling of modifier keys (and that, with a DasKeyboard-3 keyboard, which has 6-key rollover (thru usb)!).  So when typing some kinds of text, I really prefer to use Linux than MacOSX.<p>On the other end of the computer system, there&#x27;s the persistent storage, and on this side, there&#x27;s some justified criticizim of the MacOSX file system (HFS+) compared to the much better Linux (or other unix) file systems.  This may be a reason to want to use a Linux workstation, but you may also just store your file on a NAS (or just a NFS or Samba server on your Linux box), so again, the network&#x27;s the computer, and the choice of OS on your workstation is not so relevant.<p>There&#x27;s the question of the hardware, with multiple considerations.  Ignoring the question of price, there&#x27;s the question of ease of use.  MacOSX seems to provide a &quot;it just works&quot; experience, which is good, but on the other hand, if it fails, you may have a harder time than with Linux, where you can usually repair it.  For example, sleeping a laptop, or switching to new wifi networks, are no-brainers with a MacOSX laptop, but I&#x27;ve spend hours configuring linux laptops to do that.  Perhaps there&#x27;s some hope and light at the end of the tunnel, in the form of the Libre15 laptop?  <a href=""https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-laptop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-laptop</a><p>Now, perhaps you will have to test your web development on a Safari browser.  Then you will need a MacOSX box to use it, and happily, MacOSX can also run Firefox (and Chrome, etc).",1422423306

This is gamification at it&#x27;s best - when it stops being a excuse to add some points and silly badges and developers use real, practical things they generally use to build good games and apply it to non-game products.<p>The end result is an experience, as opposed to just &quot;features&quot;. Hipchat doesn&#x27;t get it. Neither does Hall or any other startup in this space.<p>Slack&#x27;s only real threat, IMHO, is Whatsapp. Whatsapp has a brilliant mobile experience which works offline too - Slack is weak there and I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t have a mobile app that works properly offline. With Whatsapp coming to desktop (although via a mobile go-through), whatsapp is suddenly a bit more usable for a team.<p>Now if they introduce a whatsapp API which works without having a phone number, it can rapidly make it an amazing alternative to Slack.

Now that the system is live, we need beta users to start building some awesome automation and provide us with feedback/etc. We have 100 accounts to hand out to qualified beta users - people who know how to whip up quick JSON-speaking code that will be able to interact with our API and start using (and testing) the system.<p>Accounts will be distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you&#x27;re interested, please send an email to info at kragle dot io. The first 100 requesters should expect an email tomorrow afternoon with details on where/how to access the system, etc.<p>For those not JSON/REST-savvy, please feel free to email us with any and all questions/comments/etc, and/or let us know if you&#x27;d like to be put on a notification list so we can let you know when the system leaves private beta and is ready for public access (no spam - we promise).<p>You can also follow us on Twitter, we&#x27;re @KragleIO.<p>Cheers, and we look forward to hearing from all our future users!<p>-The KragleIO team",1422421715

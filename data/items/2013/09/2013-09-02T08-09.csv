6314174,comment,6309882,6311536,1,0,mrow84,,,"From what I have read basic income is often suggested to be combined with a single land value tax. This means the only direct taxes are on the unimproved value of land, which is fairly easy to administer in a country like the United Kingdom, for example. That tax is then passed on to people who consume the output of the land, be that actual produce, like vegetables, or more intangible things, like crossing the land in a train.<p>The land value tax can be scaled to match the requirements of the basic income, plus additional government costs (e.g. defence). I suppose in a libertarian interpretation of that system the additional government costs would be minimal. Personally I would favour more social spending, but I could imagine less being necessary than under systems where basic provision is lower, or has more strings attached.",1378112261

Some people may in fact never pay me or they may pay me but receive more money back from me.<p>* Everyone starts with 5 free transactions and test transactions do not count.<p>* If they were referred to me, they get an additional 5 transactions for free.<p>* After they use up those 10 total initial transactions and pay for credits, the original referrer gets 5 transactions for free, once, and 20% of what the person they referred paid me. This referral arrangement continues for a long time.<p>* I integrate the product into every customer&#x27;s website for free to eliminate the friction of them not knowing how to do it. It&#x27;s much easier to do a quick remote login than to educate customers how to do it.<p>* You can sign up to use my product by SMS. No credit cards required.<p>* I don&#x27;t prevent a customer from using the product when they have zero credits. They simply don&#x27;t get the product until they pay.

My technology quietly sits on their website and credits them for their passive referrals for clicks on my widget.<p>Due to the nature of my product, charging a monthly fee does not make much sense.

6314149,comment,6313925,6314037,12,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Ah yes, the classic &quot;middlebrow dismissal&quot;.<p>Sometimes refutation comments are good and valuable though.<p>In general the decisive factor in the value of a comment is what I will call the &quot;lebowski rule&quot;. If a comment contains a statement of someone&#x27;s opinion and nothing more it is rarely worthwhile.<p>By way of illustration, this comment would fit that criterion up to this point.<p>However, I will explain my reasoning which will hopefully rescue it. In the internet age most people are aware of the variety of opinions on a topic, especially the most obvious pro/anti points on a given topic. What can often happen on sites like reddit or HN is that the first comment that espouses a well-known opinion then becomes effectively an impromptu poll. This breaks the link + comments model though because the opinion of the link is inherent in the link itself so a post voicing unadorned agreement would be easily recognized as valueless and thus generally not created or voted up. Whereas the contrarian opinion has no representation and thus becomes the proxy poll for disagreement. The problem is that people voting for/against place their votes differently, either for the link or for the most popular &quot;middlebrow dismissal&quot; comment. But because these are two separate beasts they can&#x27;t compete against each other directly. Which is why you get the behavior of highly upvoted rejection comments, since that is effectively a reflection of the controversy around the subject. Even though that rarely improves the level of discussion.<p>In contrast, a more thoroughly thought out refutation which follows through lines of reasoning and evidence will be more likely to contribute to both the disemination of new knowledge to readers as well as higher quality discussions.<p>Additionally, the mere attempt to try to improve the quality of a comment through fleshing it out will lead to a higher rate of abandonment of less worthwhile posts.<p>P.S. Here is one area where I think the HN software doesn&#x27;t help, because it encourages shorter, more quickly written posts which tends to favor the exploration of shallower depths of thought.",1378111880

The reason is simple math.<p>Suppose you have a $5k/year benefit at $0 that phases out to $0k/year at $20k. The worst way to do that is obviously to have a cliff: at $20k, you suddenly get $5k/year less, effectively an infinite marginal rate. It&#x27;s as extreme a trap as you can imagine.<p>But now consider the opposite, best case scenario that&#x27;s the softest landing spread out over that entire income range: a benefit that phases out linearly. So at $10k/year, you get a total of $12.5k; at $15k/year, you get a total of $16.25k/year. That means you automatically get a walloping marginal tax rate.<p>If you wanted to limit benefit phase outs to contribute a maximum of 5% in marginal tax rates, you&#x27;ve got to spread it out over 20x the value of the benefit. A $5k benefit has to phase out over $100k.<p>Also note that that&#x27;s by itself: you&#x27;ve also got regular taxes to pay. Worse, few of these welfare benefits have been designed so intelligently, and there are a lot of them, so you constantly hit discontinuities in marginal tax rates that make it really irrational to do any additional work or try to improve yourself.",1378111579

6314121,comment,6306795,6310797,2,0,nekopa,,,">My guess is that you don&#x27;t run a company and have never run one. You probably never risked it all to start a business in your garage and grow it to the point where you can employ dozens of people. Self funded, not with other people&#x27;s money. There&#x27;s a huge difference there as well.<p>That guess is wrong. I have started, run and sold my own companies before, and I&#x27;m currently bootstrapping a new SaaS company right now. I don&#x27;t know about using other peoples money, as I have always self-funded, I am a firm believer of organic growth, as I have never been too concerned with becoming mega-rich, I just like to fund my lifestyle. First company I started and sold was way back in 1989, when I was 18 years old, of my bedroom and using hotel meeting rooms to see clients. Nowadays I mostly consult and mentor SMEs, as I enjoy working with plucky entrepreneurs. the only reason I&#x27;m starting a new business is that I just had my second child, so I need extra funds for my lifestyle now :)<p>>If you spoke to any one of my employees you&#x27;d quickly understand that the 18th. century mentality claim would be an insult...
>That is far --VERY FAR-- from an 18th. century mentality. How dare you!<p>How dare I? So it is fine for <i>you</i> to call people (experimenting with their own, so far successful, business) childish &quot;OK, I&#x27;ll be the grown-up in the room.Are you fucking kidding me? No, really.&quot;
But if I politely say that you have an old fashioned view of business your hackles immediately rise and you get morally wounded. Let alone throwing around the word hippy to describe something you don&#x27;t like. Why not just call him a commie-pinko-bastard and be done with it. Or do you use the term hippy to imply drug taking as well as loose morals? You could call him naive, inexperienced and so forth. I would call him brave and innovative. But those are just our respective viewpoints.<p>Part of this is my fault, so let me clarify what I mean by 18th century mentality (I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that you&#x27;re an asshole or a slave-driver, I did read your comment all the way through, and you&#x27;re one of my favorite commenters here on HN):<p>&quot;Business needs a hierarchical structure with one strong leader at the top, calling all the shots taking all the risks and profits, as this is the only way that works and without it fickle employees would destroy the company within a matter of months if left to their own devices.&quot;<p>Patriarchal is another way at looking at this type of business mentality, and I associate it with what you said regarding being an adult and &#x27;hippies&#x27;. You see yourself as the tough, but fair father figure of the company. There is nothing wrong with that, and a lot of successful software projects run under the auspices of a &#x27;benevolent dictator for life&#x27;. Being ex-military I know first hand that this type of structure is necessary for successful battle operations. I just happen to think that there are also other valid models out there, and people shouldn&#x27;t be attacked as acting childish or hippyish just because they try something different. Maybe for your industry the model you prescribe is they only way. That makes me sad as even you pointed out that a man <i>died</i> because of the stress, and you yourself went to hospital. Considering that business is an abstract model that we humans have invented, wouldn&#x27;t you rather find a better way of doing business than to push yourself into an early grave?<p>Business is often regarded as war, but that is a choice we make.<p>>Understanding business economics is NOT something you can learn in two weeks. The idea that this can be taught to every employee in an organization, regardless of station and education is simply ridiculous. I am not being elitist here. It&#x27;s just reality.<p>The reality is that it has been done, and quite successfully. It may sound ridiculous, but it actually has been done. Of course, two weeks won&#x27;t give you MBA level understanding of business economics (in all honesty, a lot of the MBAs I&#x27;ve worked with probably spent about 3 hours learning finance), but you can structure the information in such a way that they understand enough to be able to make informed decisions about their salary and so forth. I know that you&#x27;re quite intelligent ere&#x27;s a thought experiment for you: what information and at what level would you present to your staff if you only had 2 weeks to give them a solid foundations of money flows in and out of a company? Especially from a &#x27;street MBA&#x27; viewpoint. I bet you&#x27;d come up with a pretty solid course.<p>>You want employees at all levels working on what they were hired to do, and not busy trying to decipher states with faulty input information.<p>Some of the world&#x27;s most successful companies have employees who also know the bigger picture of what is going on in the company. It doesn&#x27;t have to be the extreme that you&#x27;re suggesting, where the janitor isn&#x27;t mopping floors because he is busy on excel trying to figure out a 10% cost cutting maneuver. But would you be against the janitor who, knowing his departments cost impact on the company, tries to see if the floors would look better with 2 instead of 3 coats of wax, thereby cutting his wax costs by a third?<p>>One example that comes to mind is that of sales people. This can be a really odd group.<p>You&#x27;re preaching to the choir here. I completely agree. I remember one salesman I worked with who didn&#x27;t understand the differences between profit mark-up and profit margin. He kept wondering why he was losing money when he discounted something. All agreement aside, one of the best salesmen I knew talked his managers into canceling his salary completely, but paying him a higher commission rate. Needless to say the managers wished they had run through the numbers a little more before agreeing to it, as he cleaned up.<p>>That&#x27;s how it works. Again, people are not analyzing business finances. Management puts a fork in the road in front of them. Two choices. Choice number one means you might lose your job. Choice number two, you don&#x27;t. No brainer.<p>In the above, of course it&#x27;s a no brainer, people have no access to finances, and management lays out the options. One company I consulted with worked with their staff during the financial crisis to work out how to deal with the problems of lay-offs. Three of the youngest staff members came up with a novel idea, where they split one job between them. They had objective results that needed to be achieved each month, and they split the time and money according to who needed what each month. For example, when one of them needed to go on holiday he worked a whole month by himself, and took all the pay. I also had the pleasure once of consulting with a board minus 2 employee at a large insurance company. He had to lay off people in his department (the department with the largest revenue and profit) even though he was already short of staff. His main complaint was that the monthly car allowance for <i>his</i> boss would pay for 7 full time sales people which could bring in $Xmm per year. Luckily for management those numbers are well hidden. All of this came from the result of a three-quarter of a million dollar consulting project which came up with a hard to find outcome - lay-off 30% of the staff to cut costs.<p>As for unions I don&#x27;t like them or believe in them and I think they are also a part of the 18th century mentality I mentioned earlier. They are a knee jerk reaction to the way a lot of traditional companies treat their employees. This again harks back to the idea that business is war, only for the unions the enemy is the employer, which is downright dumb. And let&#x27;s not even go into the levels of corruption present in unions.<p>Business is there to make money. I just think that there are more ways to skin that cat, and that you shouldn&#x27;t shout down someone who is trying a new method. The person who tried this seems smart enough, and with your experience you could probably give him some extremely useful tips about what to avoid, what problems may come, and see what he does with that. But why should he read past are you fucking kidding me you childish fucking hippy?!?<p>To find he should follow your method of business that leaves people in hospital or dead?",1378111436

The argument is that applying an idea to a slightly different domain already provides enough value that it doesn&#x27;t need to be encouraged by patent protection. I don&#x27;t hear many people saying it has little value. The number of companies supporting themselves completely on the proceeds of selling key-value store software and services trivially shows that there is a lot of economic value in non-innovative implementations of ideas.",1378109316

When I was the first developer at a startup in Stockholm I told my boss that we should really do all the documentation in English and only talk Swedish on the phone or in personal email. When starting we&#x27;ve only been me (from Germany) and two swedes, my boss and the guy with the money.<p>The first person we hired (that is besides me) was a Spaniard who didn&#x27;t speak Swedish. The second was also Spanish and didn&#x27;t speak Swedish either. The third was from Ukraina, she spoke Swedish quite ok already. And this went on in this direction, Norwegians, Greeks, more Spaniards, etc.<p>So our decision to go English all the way made hiring much much easier from the beginning and now English became the language half of the staff is communicating in even if you meet them in person.",1378109297

6314006,comment,6309882,6313901,5,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"Essentially, by keeping the basic income guarantee sufficiently low that most people don&#x27;t want to do that. Note that having <i>everyone</i> want to work is not necessary or even necessarily desirable, you just need to be able to maintain a low enough dependency ratio that the working people don&#x27;t have to sacrifice much more than what they gain from such system.<p>I personally think that the employment market for next few decades will continue to be characterized by endemic structural unemployment. We will continue to destroy jobs faster than they are created, through automation and efficiency improvements. What&#x27;s going away especially quickly are the &quot;middle-difficulty&quot; kind of jobs -- between highly trained specialists and burger flippers. For a simple example, self-driving cars will soon revolutionize long-distance trucking. They won&#x27;t eliminate the jobs completely, but they will significantly reduce their number. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the USA. How do you retrain a 55-year old truck driver to be a software engineer? If you can&#x27;t, should he go work at Burger King for a much lower wage instead? Maybe as a society we could just allow people like him the possibility of not working at that point?",1378109196

6314003,comment,6309882,6311477,2,0,yason,,,"BI isn&#x27;t so much of a radically new idea because nearly all if not each and every (at least non-developing) country in the world already does provide some sort of welfare and/or unemployment benefits.<p>Currently this is generally done in a highly inefficient manner though dozens or hundreds of different subsidies and benefits, and it costs a lot to process everything through a thick wall of bureaucracy, and it still ends up being unfair and unmotivational to many. The canonical class of problems is that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to work because your benefits received would drop in direct proportion to what you get paid. Or it&#x27;s simply forbidden work even a little in order to be eligible to receive benefits.<p>The point of BI is to redistribute the already redistributed money in a fair and simple way: everyone gets something that may or just may not be enough to live on its own, but there are no questions asked and if you work on top of that, you scoop most of the extra money to yourself after taxes.<p>If you&#x27;re really, really a scrooge you might just make it with the BI only if you&#x27;re willing to drop your standard of living a couple of decades back. But most people want more money and they&#x27;ll work for it, if it&#x27;s five hours a week or 20 hours a week, and they don&#x27;t lose BI if they do. For any middle-class adult, BI would simply translate into a slightly lower tax rate. They would still get $500 of BI per month or so, but because they would make $5000 per month in salary on top of that the significance of BI would be marginal.",1378109177
6314002,comment,6313591,6313591,1,0,whiddershins,,,"One thing I found can be helpful is to imitate a native speaker, as if you are doing an impression of them. I think there is a part of us which remaps phenomes from a foreign language in to our mother tongue, which creates the accent. However, if you imagine you are mimicing someone, like a comedian, a different mental process happens and you replicate more of the nuances.<p>When I was trying to learn Mandarin I had the good fortune to get instruction from a friend who is a native speaker and a concert pianist.<p>In order to teach the tones (chinese uses pitch to make vocabulary distinctions) she convinced me to sing the words. She literally wrote the tones out on staff paper (i am also a musician) and i treated the phrases as little songs. It worked surprisingly well.<p>I realized that it was really hard to make myself speak that way. I felt ridiculous singing at people. In a certain sense it felt artificial, as if I was making fun of them. But I think that is what it takes to start the process of speaking new sounds. You have to let go of &quot;your&quot; voice and &quot;your&quot; way of speaking, which is rooted in your native language&#x27;s sound, and almost assume a character who sounds like a different person.<p>Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t remember much Mandarin anymore. But if i were learning Spanish I would try the same thing. I would imagine myself as a Spanish dude and &quot;put on a Spanish accent&quot; as if I were acting in a movie.",1378109148

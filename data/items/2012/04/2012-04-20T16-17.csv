Obviously you can't build your whole system with a triple store backend; that would be too slow. Especially if you have a data explosion of millions and millions of facts.<p>I've thought of a neat little distributed p2p research project that exchanges news items like HN/Reddit with your <i>interest graph</i> as determined by the nodes you share upvotes with (or weighed by some scheme you can tweak). Do you simply use RDF/OWL ontologies like FOAF, SIOC, etc. as the data transport format and then actually store information in relational databases internally?<p>I want to do this so people can curate their own interest graphs, essentially; it's like prismatic, but software under your own control. Such a platform would be extensible since you can add new ontologies to support new needs. The Slashdot crowd, for instance, might moderate with tags such as 'insightful' rather than simply 'upvoting'.<p>And can you use these graph databases like Prolog systems? And can we make that intuitive for the end user?<p>Or as a more practical example, what about a molecule database? I'd need to store representations, properties, etc. There's a potentially limitless amount of factual information that I could store on one particular molecule. How do you make your software flexible enough to ""know"" what data you have on any given molecule and decide which ""context"" to portray it? (ie. if it's of medicinal use, synthetic chemistry use, is simply a common reagent, etc.) Is some of this just inherently kept in a relational database for fast querying with the graph database backing an asynchronously updating view?",1334940249

It is an appealing idea, and although we will likely do just fine by continuing on our bootstrapped path, we believe that additional capital would accelerate this process dramatically and would be worth the dilution.<p>That said, we have a problem.  We have literally <i>zero</i> access to either the angel or venture capital world.

I am a hardware developer by profession and don't often dive very deep in software, though I love exploring software space.<p>I find example A to be very clear and readable.  I like to look at things in bite sized chunks.<p>I also like to create things in bite sized chunks. In hardware design, specifically digital chip design, I will know what my overall problem is to solve (aka the requirements), but I don't always have a clear view of what pieces I need to get there.<p>In the cases where I'm not sure about the smaller pieces, I'll write the larger overall structure and when I get to a spot where I'll need a block of smaller functionality, I'll just make up a function name on the spot and pretend it's already written and does the right thing.<p>Then I take a second pass, implementing those smaller blocks, and keep going down.  I guess that's a typical top-down approach?  I don't know, but it is what I do.<p>But I also do bottom up.  Even without knowing all the steps between, I'll often have some idea that there are some basic building blocks I'm going to need, and I'll implement those.<p>So I iterate with some steps top-down, others bottom-up, until I meet in the middle.<p>All that is a long winded way for me to say that your example A fits both approaches for me.  I can start with the overall structure and implement ""main"" first, or know what my basis will need and start with ""is_prime"" first.<p>Whereas example B seems like an all at once approach that is both more difficult to write and read.

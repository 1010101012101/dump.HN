181427,comment,181391,181391,0,0,jamess,,,"Does anyone else think that all this head scratching over what is the most trivial of problems is hilarious? Twitter is just another naming service. Instead of addressing someone as foo@foo.com, they're now just @foo. All that's needed to make twitter distributed is a new protocol for name resolution. It could be as simple as GET <a href=""http://distribtwitter.com/whois?foo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distribtwitter.com/whois?foo</a> returning <name><a href=""http://www.foo.com/mytwitterfeed</name>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foo.com/mytwitterfeed</name></a>. You could write it in a day as a wordpress plugin.<p>Then other people could come along and write recursive caching distribtwitter name servers so that they can still twitter at people they've never twittered before when distribtwitter.com is down.<p>The only conclusion I can draw from this is that web 2.0 rots the mind and turns trivial problems in to seemingly impossible problems.",1209995905

181425,comment,181316,181362,0,0,paulajohnson,,,"How much original thought is going into the floor plan of the next McMansion to be built?  Or the next 3-storey steel-framed office block?  Are these truly developed from scratch by deeply original thought every time?  I admit I have no experience of the building industry, but I seriously doubt it.  I believe they are created by following standard recipes and checklists (square feet per desk, maximum distance to restrooms, maximum distance to window).  I work on a business park full of 3 storey office blocks.  They are all minor variations on the same theme.  I live in a housing estate where all the houses are also minor variations on the same theme.  Thats what I'm talking about.  Maybe architects don't design these buildings.  Maybe I'm talking about a more junior part of the construction industry.  Either way, it completely lacks any originality.",1209995877

Lots of heads is not a solution to a pure computer science problem.  Most companies are formed around a specific solution to a computer science problem.  They then make everything proprietary and profit.<p>That's like saying, only smart computer scientists exist in the open source world.  Not true.  In fact, you simply cannot claim that there is a strong trend in one or the other.  Many smart brains in open source...  Many smart ones in industry as well...",1209994947

I lived in India for a while, and in the bigger cities, this will not fly.<p>Someone once said that if you have don't say anything in a meeting, then you should not have attended to begin with. I take this (or try to anyways) in real life. Treat any interaction as a way of getting to know someone else. Everyone is interesting, everyone has an opinion, and everybody wants to be listened to. All you have to do is the opening act. But at the end of the day you have to be sincere. If you are _not_ interested, don't bother. People can smell phoniness a mile away (thats the reason why the whole networking thing has such a bad name).<p>""Never Eat Alone"" is a good book on this subject. I don't agree with everything he has to say, but I agree with his core philosophy. If I know you, and you succeed, then I succeed. And I will do everything I can to help me succeed.

181409,comment,181244,181244,0,0,raju,,,"I just started my blog (its been work in progress for over a year now). I agree with several others that it takes time, and commitment to keep good content flowing. I spent almost all day yesterday putting out two posts. But if felt good. And its because its my way of giving something back. Some of the best information I gather is from blogs. Whether it be someone detailing the inner workings of rails routes to a one liner that saves you an hour of work. And they have helped me, so this is my way of helping someone back.<p>One of my blog posts details the issues I had trying to get Console2 to work the way I wanted it to. I wrote my experiences with it, and can hope that someone out there is having the exact same issue that I had, and benefit from it.<p>Creating new content is hard, writing well is even harder. A blog gives you the ability to work on both simultaneously. But on the flip side, who says it has to be brand new content? Write what you think is useful, maybe only to you. Treat it as a journal of thoughts, a repository of solutions to problems that you came across, a bank of opinions on things that matter to you, a list of articles that reverberated with you, it does not matter. What does matter is you being the authentic you.<p>Those who think most blogs are bs, yes, most are. But seriously, are you telling me that you have never come across a blog that worked for you? If yes, why couldn't that have been your blog?<p>I agree with Daniel that one should write to make things clearer to others. Putting an idea/suggestion/article under public (???) scrutiny is like cleaning up your house when your parents are coming over. You are forced to clean up your act, maintain focus and continuity and ensure that everything is its place.<p>In conclusion, blog if you feel the need. Blog if you think you have something useful to say, or add to a discussion, or even ""retweet"" (or reblog, in this case). I have had several people begin following me on twitter, probably because I retweet a lot. I act as a news filter/trusted source for those who dont want to have to read everything @techcrunch puts up. And if you don't want that, unfollow, or unsubscribe. But it takes time, it takes effort on my part, and it may detract you from what you should have been doing.<p>Hopefully I answered some questions here.",1209994080

The US is on the easy end of the spectrum, definitely.<p>Also, what the author seems to be suggesting is really just a ""Company Corporation"" or a ""MyCorporation"" (both large companies that do most of this work for you for not a ridiculously high fee), rather than any real change of law. I also did a google search for ""incorporate"", and the first few google ads were big companies that streamline the process for you.<p>A final small note- I would prefer that we keep a small toll charge for incorporation. It does cost the states money to process applications and keep track of filings, and it allows people to create a limited liability shield (not something I think we should be giving away for free).<p>This is similar to the logic that makes me think we'd be better off with a very very small ""penny black"" type of email tax (like 1/10th of a cent or less), just to discourage spammers.",1209993404

News flash, architecture is a 5 year program just to begin the apprenticeship to get your license, and you need a doctorate before you will start working on a disease. All that time doesn't teach you HOW to do your job, it teaches you the information you need at a minimum to start learning HOW to do it. Computer science on the other hand can be learned on your own or its a 4 year program, and then you get to that part of learning. Don't mistake the fact that there is less material to learn for saying it takes more intuition. It just takes less time to learn the material in a discipline that has been around for 40 years than one that has been around hundreds or thousands.",1209993179

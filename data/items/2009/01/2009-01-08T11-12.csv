But Scandinavian government (Denmark in this case) couldn't care less about prosperity. Right out of college, you're in the top tax bracket, paying 63% on everything above $64.000 annual income (and just under 50% on everything below). Buying a car? 180% registration tax, and slap 25% sales tax on top of that.<p>But yeah, we've got worse schools than Portugal and free mediocre healthcare, but most importantly: we have high economic equality.<p>So no, unfortunately we don't agree on the goals.",1231415548

424778,comment,424665,424665,0,0,Dauntless,,,"I would just like to point out that Enron pushed for deregulation and always blamed government regulation of the market for the huge price rise that followed the deregulation, even though it was made on purpose by their corporation.

I agree that government regulation can be as dangerous as out of control police force, but libertarians (similar to communists) are completely oblivious (sometimes on purpose) of how absurd their idealistic word is and lack basic understanding of human nature. It's better to have an open, accountable, public police force than nothing at all.",1231414744

424776,comment,424699,424699,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Criticism is not the problem. How you say it, is.<p>Firstly, recognise that what you're about to hammer on is someone's child.  Respect that, and respect the effort that's gone into it.  Recognise that it's not perfect, and they will know it's not perfect, but also that it (probably) has merit.<p>Recognise that the person who made this thing is (probably) not an idiot.  They are, however, almost certainly not an expert in everything.  But neither are you.  Your criticism is intended to help.<p>Make an effort to find that which is worth praising. Observe that other aspects need work/attention/deletion, but there will be things that are good. Be genuine in your praise of that which deserves it - there will be something.<p>Express optinions as opinions.  ""That sucks"" is an opinion that is most likely not shared by everyone.  ""Linked lists can be slow"" is a fact, but it's easier to hear that when it's accompanied by ""... but fast enough sometimes, and can be replaced by better data structures when necessary.""<p>Above all, remember that you are expressing opinions to a person who has feelings, who has invested effort, and who has been brave enough to invite criticism.  When it's well intentioned and well expressed, opinions from others are incredibly valuable. When badly expressed, opinions can be of large negative value.<p>Strive to be of positive value.",1231414500

A B C (rephrase what they just said). Hmm. What about X? Does that have any impact?"" and let them get to Y and Z themselves.<p>Just using that phrasing will help you tremendously.

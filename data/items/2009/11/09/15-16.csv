That's how I learned that one could program a computer. For sample code I could turn to a number of magazines about my computer, or the manual that came with it. No questions or outside research dependent on anyone else (including the Internet) were required. This was when I was of single-digit age. The barrier to entry was tiny (type ""10 print hello world"" at the command prompt). Nothing like that exists for a curious child at this point unless their parents take the initiative, or the child waits until they're older.",1257782389

His rise at the paper was jet-propelled—he was a kind of legend before he was 20. And he was one of the first at the paper to realize the centrality of the web and also one of the first to realize that on the web, a journalist’s personal brand can sometimes be more valuable than that of the institution that employs him. With his DealBook e-mail, read by some 200,000 people, plus the blog, with 2.5 million unique monthly visitors, plus the weekly column, breaking news scoops, television appearances, and 60,000 Twitter followers, he is one of the Times’ most visible players. Media ubiquity is a strategic decision. In the cubicle jungle of the Times, he’s an entrepreneur. “All of it is self-reinforcing,” Sorkin says.<p>Still, part of Sorkin’s problem at the Times is that he’s a new sort of creature at an essentially conservative institution, albeit one that desperately needs new models. He’s not a Timesman, exactly. He’s his own creation, and he doesn’t genuflect to Times traditions.""<p>^ this is interesting, he has already started to garner resentment by other journalists at the Times, but he seems to be doing well for himself and is really building a brand",1257780181

People always say it&#x27;s not just a chat app, but if you use it just for chat then it&#x27;s a pretty good one with good voice and video chat quality, supports group chat well and has a clean UI. All the other features are opt-in, hidden in several level of menus. There are no flashy confusing buttons, no daily reminder asking you to try some new feature, no distraction. For me and my friends who has long abandoned the bloated and flashy QQ for simple gtalk (before google got banned), WeChat is a breath of fresh air.",1439288173

Against the euro, the CNY has appreciated by about 20% in the past 12 months, so any deval is as much about dollar strength (against which the CNY is semi-pegged). Europe has been devaluing through it&#x27;s own QE and it buys about 20% of Chinese exports roughly. The same picture is more or less true of all the emerging markets that China exports to. Thus it&#x27;s pretty much a rebalancing than anything else, and let&#x27;s not forget it&#x27;s only 2% (so far). Perhaps the most interesting chart is China&#x27;s fiercest competitor, Japan. The yen is down more than 50% against the yuan in the past 2 years:<p>CNYJPY past 60 months:<p><pre><code>     +-+------+-------+-------+------+-------+-------+--+

For syntax trees annotated with types he uses Tree[Type], which makes sense. Then for untyped syntax trees (i.e. trees without any annotation) he uses Tree[Nothing]. Now he needs unsafe hacks to get the desired subtype relationship Tree[Type] <: Tree[Nothing]. The compiler understands that Tree is covariant, so he overrides this with an unsafe annotation to make Tree contravariant. Using Nothing rather than the top/unit type (not sure what that&#x27;s called in Scala, Any?) is what doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Intuitively an un-annotated tree is a Tree annotated with values that carry no information, not a tree annotated with values of the uninhabited type.

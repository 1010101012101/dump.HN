And he replied, ""Creativity is not copying"". So simple and so obvious, I suppose, yet that was a key moment for me. Because until then I had always copied, but from that moment on everything changed. <i>I understood something I had never understood before. I passed from being a technician to a creator.'</i>",1219304137
282450,comment,281521,281521,0,0,jdoliner,,,"Having just completed a course in which this was one of the major topics of discussion I feel I can perhaps help to clear a few things up. Generally we consider the mark test to signify self awareness. What's important in the test is that in order to past the animal must realize that the creature is them. Human's have trouble seeing what a jump this is since it's very easy for us.<p>The example of robots, while probably more interesting to the members of this board is different in that these robots were instructed how to recognize themselves by humans that know they exist. They didn't have to make the jump of the concept of self by themselves. Unfortunately as is characteristic of softer sciences I really can't make this distinction any harder so take it or leave it.<p>An the other hand 5 magpies is a pretty pathetic sample size. Even picture perfect results have a 1/32 chance of occurring with random behaviour. I think we can rest assured that the next article on this topic will not include Magpies in its list of previous successes.",1219304043

282432,comment,281857,281857,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"I'm a bit surprised by some of the reactions here, starting with Jason's quoted in the article update (""Wasn’t worth the techrunch headache"").  It seems that there are a lot of people who either a) don't take Securities laws seriously, b) don't see the point of Securities laws, or c) think that Twitter is somehow different than other forms of publication.<p>To take these points in order:<p>First, selling shares in a company, even a privately held one, has legal implications, and shouldn't be done without consultation with a lawyer. (I'm a bit concerned that's not obvious to Jason.)  If you're going to play the game, take the time to learn the rules.<p>Second: I really don't see how the Securities Act can be viewed to be creating unreasonable barriers to entry for startups, or stifle innovation.  The regulations are fairly straightforward, and the intent is clear.  Again, anyone seriously doubting this ought to talk to their attorney about the matter.  And yes, you'll need an attorney if you are serious about a start-up.<p>Finally, for the purposes of the law, why should posting a message to the world on Twitter be considered any different than taking out an ad in a newspaper?  I don't see how Jason's message could be viewed as ""innocuous""-- this isn't casual, private conversation.  It's publication, and Twitter users should remember that.",1219302116

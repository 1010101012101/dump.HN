If I'm going to be happy working at any one of the companies, good perks can put one ahead of the other.<p>And besides, if the perks are outstanding enough, what is wrong with taking a job where the work isn't the most important factor in your choice to be there? For many,  jobs are just a means to provide for their needs and wants in life. Not a place to spend their creative energy or brain power.  They save those for the rest of their more enjoyable life activities.<p>Note: I personally have to work at a place where the work is interesting or I'll go nuts.  Work is important to me and is a form of expression.  But it's not like that for everyone.",1242766792

I don't doubt that indexing content in real time and making it searchable has some utility - see the comment on this article about some question on the t.v. show Lost - but maybe 1/100 of my searches are like that.

I am ok with this as long as Google keeps the Tweet search results separate but equal (somewhat like they keep the blog search results separate via blog search but equal in that blog posts with good pageranks do appear in search results.

I don't like the ""fake"" connotation; on the other hand, realizing others' reactions to you will correspond to your deportment, is useful.<p>Heck, <i>your</i> reaction <i>to yourself</i> will correspond to your deportment.  This is why a central tenet of self-help is self-respect.<p>Thinking of this another way, most people are social creatures and have a certain tendency to ""follow the crowd"".  If ""the crowd"" at a particular moment is you, and if you are demeaning or dismissive of yourself, they will pick up and respond to the message.<p>Sometimes -- often -- socialization not about some ""absolute"" of behavior.  It is all about context, and about relative values defined within that context.  Don't blemish your own reputation (or ""brand"", as they say these days), either by being a fake or by disgorging all its flaws.  People aren't too interested in the flaws, unless it's something they can and need to learn from.  And the situations and time for such sharing and learning are a limited part of overall social activity.<p>EDIT:  Upon rereading, I guess I may have digressed a bit from the business / start-up context of the original question.  But there, too, people are most interested in how you can solve their problems and make their lives better.  Don't let the challenges you face overshadow your ability to do this for them.",1242764607

617539,comment,616526,616526,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"Intro to Algorithms by CLR is the best first book on the subject I know of.  MIT has a complete set of lecture videos:<p><a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-046JFall-2005/CourseHome/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Compute...</a><p>But based on my own (admittedly weird) experience, Algorithms <i>per se</i> might not be the best place to start.  You might do better starting off with graph theory instead because:<p>1. It's an equally fundamental entree to the same theoretical CS material.  Graphs abstract data structures like algorithms abstract programs.<p>1a.  You wind up learning a lot of the same material.<p>2. The ""core"" of Algorithmic analysis is solving counting problems with recurrence relations, sort of like the way ""canceling terms"" is the core of high school algebra.  It's easy to explain the concept in a few words, so it's easy to think you understand it, but you have to practice it in a lot of different contexts to really master the skill.  There's also a lot of deep theory hiding below the surface.  Graph theory, on the other hand, starts out with definitions that you can blow through in a day, and then builds progressively more complicated structures for you to analyze.<p>3. Most of the proofs in graph theory actually involve writing programs to construct an existence proof or verify a property.  Obviously this is also true of algorithms, but the correspondence between proofs and programs is harder to see there.<p>4. Graph theory touches higher math in more accessible places than algorithmic analysis.  You can analyze graphs with matrices, mess around with their eigenvalues (although I think the preferred term is ""spectrum""), do some group theory -- ""advanced undergraduate"" stuff.  The only place in higher math where algorithms really come into play is number theory, which requires a lot of theoretical machinery to make its sausages.",1242764491

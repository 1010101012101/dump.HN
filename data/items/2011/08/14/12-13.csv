The KDK isn't public yet, and it seems imposible to get into the beta. On top of that, the KDK is lacking some basic APIs (like collection management)<p>- Indie support.

Several of them (the ones related to DRM, mostly) kept me from buying a Kindle for a very long time.<p>However, I love my Kindle.<p>First and most importantly, it means that books can now compete with the internet in convenience, and that's meant that I've read more in the last few months than I have in the several years before that. Thinking ""I want to read <X>"" and being able to start reading minutes rather than days later is <i>awesome</i>.<p>Second, I find the Kindle to be much nicer to read than cheap trade paperbacks. The text is higher-contrast and crisper, and only having to push a button rather than turn a page means I can read more comfortably. That there's less text on each screen was an issue at first for me (because, like the author, I read very quickly), but I've since gotten used to it and don't even notice anymore.<p>It has its downsides, and I really do hope they're resolved at some point in the future, but my Kindle has become something I really wouldn't want to live without, at this point.",1313324769

Although the world is slowly walking toward Python 3, it's still unclear when the majority of libraries and frameworks will support it. Starting with 2 will in no way inhibit someone from eventually moving to 3 when that's appropriate. Virtually everything (including 3rd party packages) in the Python world is available in 2, and a big chunk is not available in 3.<p>One of Python's deserved claims to fame is ""batteries included."" It comes with just about every facility you could ever want, and they're all generally easy to use. For example, to get input editing in a console program, ""import readline"" and you're done. Astounding.<p>But another benefit of Python is 3rd party library and framework support; ""extra batteries available."" Everything that can be done in and outside of Python can be done with Python 2, but a substantial portion of the 3rd party world has not yet converted over, and it's difficult to say when that will happen. The only people, IMO, who should use 3 are people who already know Python <i>and</i> who have a <i>specific</i> need for something provided in Python 3 or a 3rd party package.<p>I'd go with Python's excellent online tutorial to see how it goes, and then look at other resources if interest remains.<p><a href=""http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html</a><p>You'll note that python.org still defaults to Python 2 in their doc URLs.<p>Here's Python on the 2 vs 3 question:<p><a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3</a><p>I wouldn't go with PHP as a new programmer, unless there's a specific desire to work on WordPress or Drupal sites.

You can still do web work in Python if you want, so there's no advantage with PHP except with specific frameworks that use PHP; there's every advantage with Python because of the huge number of domains covered by it, including the web.<p>C and C++ are going to be very difficult first languages for someone learning on their own. Lots of system programming is done in C, and C++, and they have their advantages.

You're right, those languages do things <i>very</i> differently from one another - especially when it comes to OO. In this case, the stated goal was to define a class that exposes a public property.

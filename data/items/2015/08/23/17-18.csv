From his Wikipedia page: &quot;At the age of 19, he fled East Germany and began a month-long trek to West Germany to escape the East German state. During this trek, part of his finger was lost but surgically reattached. Kretschmann crossed four borders (Hungary, Yugoslavia, Austria) with nothing other than his passport and the equivalent of $100 in his possession.&quot; Pretty incredible!",1440352777

As you said, you feel confident in implementing something. I think that&#x27;s the key thing, getting the implementation done or getting the project built.<p>There is certainly room for the specialists, take security for example, implementing certain types of security take a specific set of knowledge and experience. If that&#x27;s what you love to do, then that&#x27;s a fine path. If you&#x27;d rather build things or like to experiment, a more general approach is good. You can always team up with other people later on if you need more specialisation in a certain area.<p>I think as well that Jack of all trades doesn&#x27;t apply as much to technology as it does to building for example. A builder may specialise in bricklaying for example. That&#x27;s great, building a modern building on your own is going to take a team anyway. Besides, bricklaying probably isn&#x27;t going anywhere any time soon.<p>Technology on the other hand is constantly changing. You could be a specialist in a programming language that five years down the line is mostly irrelevant with weak support.<p>I think in a way, you&#x27;re both. You seem to specialise mostly in programming, while generalising within programming. I think that&#x27;s a good mix to allow you to develop a strong and useful skill set while remaining lean and adaptable.",1440352290

Nobody knew what the line was for or what it was the store was getting in that day. Some people spend the night waiting just to be in front. After standing in line all day, finally by dusk a truck pulls up. Everybody looking in anxiety and worried about not being enough merchandise, still not knowing what was inside. A few men start unloading the boxes inside the store. All of a sudden people at the front of the line start spreading the rumors, &quot;it&#x27;s bananas!&quot;, &quot;what is a banana?&quot; I thought to myself. I was 5 years old and had no idea what it was. We made our way from outside, into the store. The store was full of empty shelves, there was literally no inventory. Finally we got the cashier, it was our turn and my grandpa got handed a big box and he handed the clerk money. &quot;Hurry&quot; my grandpa said, we rushed out of the store and started walking back home. &quot;There&#x27;s no more!&quot; I heard somebody shout out of the store. There were still at least a hundred people in line. We kept walking, not looking back. We got home and opened the box. It was full of green bananas. We tried to eat them, I loved it. Only later in life I found out bananas supposed to be yellow and not bitter :)",1440352289

A 15% tax on $20k a year will lead to eviction, hunger and health problems, creating social ills that we&#x27;ll need government programs to deal with. Or they&#x27;ll just not pay the tax, so again with the prisons. And again, the overall tax needs to be increased to deal with a stupid choice in the tax code. This is inefficient and arguably unfair.<p>I disagree. If you know exactly how much money you have to pay each month, you can budget for it. A well planned budget can make $20K a livable income. I grew up in a family of 4 at that level. We tithed 10% of our income on top of the taxes we paid. We never were on Government welfare. And I never went hungry or didn&#x27;t have a home. It wasn&#x27;t easy, lots of people helped us, but I never realy realized we were &quot;poor&quot; until I went to college.<p>Sure it&#x27;s just my family, but I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of other families I knew as a kid were in similar situations.<p>> b) Furthermore, if we don&#x27;t want to punish the poor for being poor, we have to reduce the ratio, meaning we greatly reduce investment in infrastructure, education, etc, mainly as a result of undertaxing the wealthy to avoid punishing the poor. This also seems hella backwards.<p>The goal is to help make it so that the poor are no longer poor. Government overspending, discriminatory taxation, loophole filled regulation, etc, helps mess things up so that it&#x27;s really hard for the poor to stop being poor.<p>Fixing the tax code would be one step in solving the overall problem.",1440351923

If you already have a system (e.g. similar to the current CA system) to tell the remote server to allow a newly generated key in, what purpose does the key serve here at all?<p>It protects against old key compromise. Sometimes the attacker will compromise a key from a week-old backup or because someone forgot to wipe the disk when they replaced a PC. If the key is changed on every use or on a short interval then it will be unusable by the time the attacker learns it.<p>Of course, that also means a backup of the key will be unusable to the actual user.<p>> Also - the encrypted private key is already two-factor authentication - you <i>have</i> the key and you <i>know</i> the encryption password for the key. Is this fact usually ignored by everyone because paswordless keys are that common?<p>Key files encrypted with passwords are weak because an attacker who compromises the key file can then crack the password offline. By contrast, when the password is verified by the remote server, the attacker has to guess passwords online, which is much slower and allows the server to block or rate limit the attacker after too many bad passwords.",1440351414

10106094,comment,10104203,10105842,0,0,useerup,,,"> PowerShell&#x27;s object pipeline is functionally analogous to function chaining in languages like Ruby, Python, and JavaScript<p>No, in those languages function results are bound upon returning from the function. PowerShell&#x27;s pipeline would be more like function chaining where each function is a co-routine that can yield partial results, which would make it considerable more complicated.<p><i></i>So your attempt at trivializing PowerShell fails from the start.<i></i><p>For your information, here is roughly how a PowerShell pipeline is set up, processed and torn down:<p>1. <i>BeginProcess</i> is invoked for each command in the pipeline, starting with <i>the last</i> command of the pipeline, working towards the first. When each command is initialized this way, it can start receiving objects from preceding command on the pipeline. Each command may start produce objects already during this phase, as all subsequent commands are ready to process them. If it produces objects, <i>ProcessRecord</i> of the subsequent command is invoked immediately.\n2. <i>ProcessRecord</i> is invoked on the first command of the pipeline. If it yields objects, <i>ProcessRecord</i> of the subsequent command is invoked for each object, thus &quot;pushing&quot; objects through\n3. <i>EndProcess</i> is invoked for the <i>first</i> command of the pipeline. It it yields objects, <i>ProcessRecord</i> of the subsequent command is invoked for each object. When EndProcess completes for the first command of the pipeline, <i>EndProcess</i> is invoked for the subsequent command and so forth until <i>EndProcess</i> has been invoked for all commands of the pipeline.<p>As you can see, each cmdlet has 3 phases: initialization, processing and completion. All cmdlets (functions?) become active at the same time, with the control flow passing to each command (function?) multiple times during each phase. This can be implemented in any turing complete language, but <i>function chaining</i> is a lame attempt at trivializing it. Throw in reactive sequences and it may get closer.<p>Consider how <i>Sort-Object</i> (alias <i>sort</i>) is implemented: It does nothing during BeginProcess, during ProcessRecord it adds to an internal collection but does not yield any objects (yet), during EndProcess it sorts and yields all of the collected records. This is clearly analogous to how sort in byte/text stream is implemented: When the process starts it does nothing but initialize and starts listening on stdin, for each &quot;line&quot; on <i>stdin</i> it adds to an internal collection, and when <i>stdin</i> is closed it sorts the collection and writes the &quot;lines&quot; to <i>stdout</i>. 3 phases.<p>Even so, it doesn&#x27;t really matter how it is <i>implemented</i>, a shell is inherently about how you <i>interact</i> with the shell.<p>> PowerShell&#x27;s object pipeline does not exist outside of the .NET runtime and you can not stream objects between arbitrary executables outside of the .NET runtime.<p>You are locked in the Unix view of the world and is unable to consider that long standing assumptions about &quot;the way to do it&quot; may need a refresh. If you want to leverage objects for system management then yes, you need a <i>system-wide</i> object model. Unix was not built with an object model. Windows was sort-of build with an object model (handles) but it is not versatile enough as a system-wide management model.<p>However, the good thing about objects is that they are abstractions which can easily wrap existing operating system concepts, such as files, processes, access control lists, drivers, users, groups, network connections etc. .NET is a mature object model and with a lot of tooling. Building PowerShell so that the abstractions over network adapters, users etc become represented by .NET classes enable a lot of tooling and infrastructure right from the beginning.",1440350734

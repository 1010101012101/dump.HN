(I don&#x27;t care if your components&#x27; average EPTs dropped 60% since last release if your app is still crap... You made it better but not in a way I care about, and tell me again why you need access to my list of contacts?)<p>Production telemetry is a godsend for developers to debug their crappy apps (I&#x27;d wish there were no buggy, crappy apps in the first place, but...) but I think there&#x27;s an acceptable way and a questionable way of getting it. The acceptable way is simply requiring user action. Many programs let you email or just &#x27;report&#x27; logs and other info if you or the program think there&#x27;s a problem you want someone to look into. Some make it easy to see what the data actually consists of which can help you tell if they put effort trying to know as little as necessary, avoiding things not their business. There&#x27;s also an expectation that the data will be used once for helping you and that&#x27;s all. The questionable way of getting the data is to just hoover up whatever behind the scenes.<p>The interesting cases (which apply to other data too) are in between. On one hand it&#x27;s acceptable for LinkedIn to ask for your email password so they can get a list of people you might know and want to connect with, but you have little assurance they don&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t in the future) questionably hoover up all your email contents for vague reason x, no reason yet/just in case, or inadvertently for really unfortunate reason y when they get compromised, and that&#x27;s enough for at least a creepy feeling if not fear in some cases.",1451991427

False advertising, in a sense.</i><p>They weren&#x27;t falsely bragging about numbers in marketing materials, they were listing specific doctors at specific addresses in their tools for finding in-network doctors that were not in their network or were not at that address. Different from geographic density but related.<p>> <i>That is very different from the problem statement: how do you make a network offer inducements at a loss to recruit additional providers?</i><p>It&#x27;s really not complicated: by saying they can&#x27;t operate in a certain area without a sufficient network. They either recruit more doctors or they pack up.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re missing that insurance companies in California don&#x27;t usually operate statewide? I assume this is common across the country. The key is that care has to be available near your house or workplace. When applying for insurance you are specifically offered companies that have coverage in those areas (often at the county or city level of granularity).<p>You can&#x27;t sign up for an insurance policy at the other end of the state from a company&#x27;s network of doctors and expect them to sign up doctors around you, because, again, if they don&#x27;t have sufficient density of doctors where you are, they don&#x27;t cover people there in the first place.<p>> <i>There is no element of law that says to an underwriter, &quot;Hey, you gotta add more providers in this area and that area now, or we will punish you.&quot; The law doesn&#x27;t give government that power.</i><p>Yes, it really really does.",1451991317

I might not have expressed myself clearly...<p>The point I was trying to make is that JSX is significantly more convenient for coders like me, as the markup is is the trivial part and the logic is usually the complicated part. So a javascript-first approach benefits me tremendously over trying to figure out how to get my logic working around the logic-less templating systems, or over learning a html-like DSL as in the case of Angular or Vue.js.<p>I&#x27;ve even considered not using JSX at all (a bit like mithril.js). The only reason I still do is that I like the visual separation of code and markup, and that I like seeing what the the end result will look like (more or less).<p>So if the JSX approach is so much more convenient for coders (not all, but many), and if the types of projects where you use React tend to be too complex to involve non-coders writing html/css anyways (in my experience), why not just use JSX?<p>That said, I don&#x27;t really have a horse in this race either, I guess, because I&#x27;ll adjust my choices based on circumstances. A while back, for example, I used Ractive.js instead of React.js for a project, because Ractive.js uses mustache templates and simpler two-way binding (a bit like Knockout.js). Because of the particular circumstances and the relative lack of complexity of the app, I figured I&#x27;d optimize for what cheap(er) front-enders with less coding experience could take over from me, as I wasn&#x27;t planning to stay on the project long-term.",1451991304

Then you should ask if there&#x27;s anything to talk about. If the manager then proceeds to go to HR, they will be very nervous about taking action against you, as you&#x27;ve shown that you may resort to legal action against the company, and the manager has just given you a piece of documentation that generally hasn&#x27;t been reviewed by HR/legal beforehand.<p>The thing is, a court could easily find such a document constitutes coercion, or if poorly worded (&quot;you will no longer have access to ...&quot;, or, God help an employer who does this, &quot;your pay/pension/hours/... will be reduced by xxx&quot; for instance) can be constituted as breach of contract, an attempt to force someone to quit (or worse: an attempt to force you to do something unrelated to your work), or ...<p>Keep in mind that employers aren&#x27;t generally all that likely to win labor cases.

It is designed for a full-fledged <i>schema</i> - it builds on the lessons of SGML and its predecessors such as GML[0], for people who need those things, which has historically meant &quot;documentation writers&quot;. DocBook and DITA do not really have equals at what they do, which is semantic, textual content with rich markup. (Yes, you like TeX. But it focuses on presentation for typesetting, not semantic meaning.)<p>This means that in practice XML is really useful for describing an abstract, pre-tokenized syntax. This is a useful tool from a language design perspective; it lets you take an intermediate position between human-friendly and machine-friendly formats, without going straight to binary data or writing a full string parser. When computer language tooling emits an XML AST, they give tool-writers who would like to manipulate or inspect the AST a major leg up.<p>Simpler forms like sexps or JSON exact additional overheads on that problem that can be nearly as bad as just writing a custom string parser, once you get beyond the &quot;strings, numbers, and simple containers&quot; cases that are basically about data serialization, not data parsing. You want to have nodes that have unique names or attributes once you get into the parsing problem, but they are superfluous if you have plain old data. And as soon as you get into mixing different types of documents validation becomes a major concern and XML has the right groundwork for that.<p>It&#x27;s just that most people don&#x27;t want or need to deal with data of that complexity, especially since XML as a plaintext document just looks like angle-bracket trash. For those needs they are better off writing in something that a string parser can work with and then using XML as an intermediate, if at all. Even for the documentation-writing situation, it&#x27;s easier to write Markdown for 98% of the prose and then convert it to add the last 2%.<p>Basically, XML has been used for far too many things that it shouldn&#x27;t, and the blame for that lies on some 90&#x27;s-era hype machines that decided that XML would be the buzzword of the future and pushed it into every technology. We got some nice tooling out of it, but in the end, it&#x27;s still most useful for a certain kind of document markup.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Languag...</a>",1451989134

I was largely self-taught, but I read many, many books and even wrote quite a bit of working code. I wish someone told me how naive I was, how mistaken in many areas. Instead, I went on to work - having quite a good luck and joining a very capable, professional team - and was in for the most depressing half a year in my life. All my teammates helped, and gradually I started seeing things in context and learned to appreciate all the accidental complexity and real-life requirements.

These conferences like to have acceptance rates of 20% or lower. Supposedly this ensures that only the best of the best papers are published in these venues. In practice, the 20% or lower criterion ends accepting a motley crowd of papers with all sorts of biases. IMO papers submitted by PC members are favored, certain &quot;hot&quot; subfields tend to be favored, papers written by well-established research groups are favored over papers from &quot;unknown&quot; groups. I&#x27;m sure there are many other biases.<p>From the authors&#x27; perspective, we end up playing all kinds of &quot;positioning&quot; games to try and increase the chance of acceptance. Maybe I really have a technique that I designed to increase performance, but the hot new thing program committees are looking for is reliability. So I&#x27;ll try and sell my paper as a reliability enhancer with a side-benefit of better performance. Or maybe I have some technique that works really well in practice but is just a combination of two previously known ideas. If my papers says so in plain English, there&#x27;s almost zero chance of acceptance a top tier venue. So instead I&#x27;ll go to great lengths to obfuscate the connection between the prior art and my work and spin it as brand new revolutionary insight that just so happens to be vaguely related to these previously known techniques.<p>The original point of peer review was: (a) catch unsound experimental practices and methodologies and (b) provide authors feedback to help improve the paper. The competitive nature of modern peer review seems to have lost sight of these original goals. Instead it&#x27;s being used as some sort of ranking system for estimated future impact/novelty based on necessarily limited current information. The review practices in the OP seem to be going back to the original goal.",1451988548

They have a very alpha/beta feel to them; Mac client random crashes, can't remove dock icon, etc.<p>2. Linux support is added. You know most of those netbooks you speak of are running linux now, right? ;)<p>Good luck gentlemen, I will be keeping an eye on this one...",1232200486

Maybe I'm terribly naive, but it feels like lying happens far less here than in other corners of the tubes.<p>So I believe icode, personally.  My feelings are ""good for him"" and ""I hope he enjoys his steak and strippers"".",1232200233

438068,comment,437853,437853,0,0,profgubler,,,"I don't know about you, be if I was the founder of Jaiku I would be very upset. You sold your company to Google, hoping it would become this great tool that everyone would be using, and then once google gets a hold of it they kill it, because they can't get it back out the door. So it dies before it ever evens has a chance. The company was Google's and they were free to do with it what they like, but that is just sad.<p>Then again maybe they aren't to sad, because they likely made a good bit of money on the deal.",1232199466

438062,comment,436989,437784,0,0,sokoloff,,,"0.5% is 200 vs 201, not 20 vs 21 (that would be 5%).<p>All an individual cares about is 1 vs 0 crashes-per-flight, not 200 vs 201 crashes per bajillion flights. So if I could buy a ticket on Qantas (0 fatalities in their entire jet era) or Aeroflot (31 in the last 19 years, including 2 unrelated on the same day from the same airport) for the same trip, I'll clearly take Qantas, even if the Qantas flight is 3x as expensive, as I assume most people would.<p>But here's where humans don't do math well comes in. Even a tiny difference in actual safety is dramatically over-valued. ""No child of mine is going to be subjected to an extra 0.5% risk just to see some big mouse in Florida! I'd sooner drive there than fly <i>THAT</i> airline!"" And that is how airlines with a bad reputation for safety end up merging, getting bought, shutting down or simply changing names. And how people who can't rationally make decisions end up driving 800 miles to Disney instead of flying, because the risks of driving are much less visible to them.",1232198838

438053,comment,431285,431838,0,0,11ren,,,"With malleability, I think you're talking about low-level control, where you work directly in terms of the data structures that will be serialized as JSON. You might be translating between the domain data structures and the JSON structure; or they might appear direction as JSON. This is malleable in that you tweak it however you want; and it's simple in that you have direct access to everything. You can do validation in the same way. If something goes wrong, you have all the information available to deal with it as you see fit.<p>The wire format doesn't affect this approach - it could be JSON or XML. However, JSON and data structures maps cleanly, because it's an object format already. To do the same thing with XML requires an extra level, and you get a meta-format like xmlrpc, which is pretty ugly.<p>So I think you're talking about a kind of object serialization, with object-to-object data binding.<p>XML Schema is an attempt to factor out the grammar of the data structures, so that they can be checked automatically, and other grammar-based tasks can be automated. I think this is a worthy quest, succeed or fail. One specific failing we discussed was error messages.<p>I'm trying to grasp your point of view, and presenting what I think it is, so you tell me if I got it right or not (assuming you see this reply).",1232198084
438052,comment,431285,431838,0,0,11ren,,,"Incidentally, I was just parsing some XML Schema documents, and the error messages were more helpful than I expected - it gave the rule of the grammar that was causing problems. However, this rule looked like it was taken from the English specification of XML Schema, when it could be (and should be) automatically inferred from the machine readable version of the grammar (i.e. the XML Schema for XML Schema documents).",1232197996

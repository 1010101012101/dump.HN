290522,comment,290216,290216,0,0,gcv,,,"It's a tough call. I almost pulled the trigger a year ago and then cancelled my appointment two days before the surgery. My reasons:<p>1. Google around for LASIK horror stories. Most people are happy, but I did not want to become a statistic.<p>2. Dry eyes. According to my research, it is a major complication that the surgeons do not mention. Anecdotally, a friend of mine who had LASIK has dry eyes now. Another friend does not (although he says his sight deteriorated since the surgery).<p>3. Alternatives. It's a little distressing that few civilian surgeons perform PRK. I understand that they don't want to deal with patients for four months, but my research suggests that it's the more reliable procedure in the long term. The Navy seems to trust PRK more for its pilots because it does not trust the flap's structural integrity.",1220050540
290521,comment,289631,289704,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"I'm not a veteran, but in High School I did attend a summer program at the Coast Guard academy that was aimed at Juniors who wanted to become engineers.
The USCG is <i>tough</i>. The academy (I know, you're entering as a reservist, not active duty, but the concept holds) prides themselves on being militarily the toughest of all the academies. Since a large percentage of the kids in the program applied to the Academy later, they always put you through one day in the life of a 'swab' (freshman cadet) and it ain't easy. I didn't enter the Guard, but did go to Merchant Marine school after that and it was cake compared to what New London would have been.<p>Being a Coastie looks like a rewarding, challenging life, but it ain't gonna be easy!",1220050484

Part of it is that, thanks to doing the startup I learned to multitask. And its fairly easy to get in shape if you multitask, we all need a break, so during the 1 hour I spend watching TV I also work out.<p>And I actually recommended that 100 push ups challenge(I'm up to 65 full fledged pushups, by which I mean you go all the way down hold, then go all the way up and hold), it really helps to get you into shape by getting you into the whole mindset towards working out. + its a huge confidence builder",1220049449

290505,comment,290332,290417,0,0,mdasen,,,"You have an ""'unlimited' line"" from Comcast?  Did you get that in writing, because their website doesn't seem to indicate anywhere that it's unlimited.  In fact, in the first 5 pages of google results, the only time Comcast uses the term unlimited with their internet service is to say ""High-speed bandwidth and network resources are not unlimited."" (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=Klr&q=unlimited+site:comcast.com&start=0&sa=N"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&...</a>, <a href=""http://www.comcast.com/customers/faq/FaqDetails.ashx?ID=4567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comcast.com/customers/faq/FaqDetails.ashx?ID=4567</a>).<p>In fact, it's impossible to be unlimited since that would imply infinite bandwidth per second.  Once it isn't infinite bandwidth per second, you can interpret ""unlimited"" in a number of ways.  You want it to be unlimited in terms of bandwidth transfer.  Comcast could argue (if they ever used the term unlimited) that it is referring to how long you are allowed to be online and not how much you can transfer.<p>There are lots of legal things that cost money.  Running your computer 24/7 costs more money (in electricity) than running it 8 hours a day.  Go yell at the electric company!  This isn't a matter of legality vs. illegality or proper use vs. improper use.  The fact is that resources (whether it be bandwidth, electricity, or food) is limited.  With bandwidth, it's easy to accommodate heavy users which is awesome (unlike electricity and food which generally scale up linearly in costs).  That's great!  It doesn't make bandwidth magic and there are still limitations.  Yeah, limitations suck whether it be the fact that bandwidth needs some sort of metering or the fact that I can't transport myself across the country Star-Trek style.  To be successful, one needs to understand, accept, and work within limitations to create and act in ways that work.",1220048783

My vision is around 20/30 with contacts, but I'm legally blind without them (20/400).<p>I know my condition isn't quite the same as yours, but here's some advice:<p>1. Do <i>not</i> get surgery unless it is absolutely essential. If you're only mildly nearsighted, then stick with glasses. Your eyes are very intricate, and any amount of surgery is going to do additional damage.<p>2. Sending time on the computer, even 18 hours a day (as I sometimes do), won't have major long-term impact on your vision. I specifically asked my doctor about this in May when I went in for a new contact prescription. Time on the computer will make your eyes tired, but that's all. Just take a break and you'll be fine.<p>Keep in mind I am not a doctor, and you should consult your own ophthalmologist.",1220048019

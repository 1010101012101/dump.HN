It&#x27;s a gallery of images, and each image has its own document.<p>The DOM is a dinosaur unfortunately, it just gets the job done for most basic websites. CSS is also a language made for the DOM. The thing is, the DOM isn&#x27;t required for a web page. Netflix could have coded up their entire UI on a Javascript 2D game engine and could have ended up with a faster app for sure.

(Provided the runtime itself can be well-specified in the project configuration and the language&#x27;s dependency management system defaults to exact immutable declarations.)<p>But throw in a dependency on Redis and Postgres, and you get into territory where traditional tools fall over pretty quickly, especially if different branches of your codebase depend upon different versions of Redis.<p>Personally Guix is more interesting to me as a way to keep my own stuff declarative rather than for sharing across a team of developers. But the cost doesn&#x27;t seem too high if your application has external dependencies which traditional tools suck at; I&#x27;ve felt that pain and it isn&#x27;t pretty.",1439430541

8291217,comment,8290067,8290986,3,0,lutusp,,,"> edit: downvoters can&#x27;t handle the truth?<p>No, your logic is flawed. Let&#x27;s say there is a population of 1,000 male programmers, with a normal distribution of IQ (mean 100, S.D. 15), and therefore 15.87% are at or above 1 sigma. That&#x27;s 159 male programmers, more or less, regarded as exceptional.<p>Let&#x27;s further say that we have a population of 100 female programmers with exactly the same statistical breakdown, with 15.87% above 1 sigma, reflecting the IQ stats for the population as a whole, male and female. This makes 16 female programmers, more or less, regarded as exceptional.<p>This means (a) there are more exceptional male programmers by count than female programmers, but it also means that (b) statistically, a selected male programmer is likely to be equal to a selected female programmer, and the more programmers you compare, the more equal the outcome becomes.<p>Mathematically:<p>emp / tmp = efp / tfp = 15.87%<p>Where:<p>emp = exceptional male programmers<p>tmp = total male programmers<p>efp = exceptional female programmers<p>tfp = total female programmers<p>This means that your claim above:<p>> So the male candidate is probably better a coder most of the time.<p>Is perfect nonsense, and coincidentally calls into question the presumed intellectual superiority of males.",1410281949

8291144,comment,8288682,8288682,3,0,neilxm,,,"The Case for and against U Waterloo<p>I did my undergrad as well as my master&#x27;s in Mechatronics at UWaterloo. Thought I&#x27;d pitch in to shed some light on two of the key themes of this conversation, Co-op and Academic research.<p>1. Co-op - \nThe Waterloo 4 month alternating Co-op program has its pros and cons. On one hand you get the chance to go out and sample a bunch of different kinds of jobs (if you proactively choose to do so), travel, fund your own education without drowning in student loans and get a taste for what engineering outside the classroom might be like. Currently with a large number of start-ups in Waterloo a lot of Co-op students work with start-ups which, for this forum, should undoubtedly be a good thing.<p>On the other hand, the obsession with co-op chips away from the culture of learning that a University should harbor. I remember freaking out about jobs, interviews and my resume from the 3rd week of classes in first year. It seems to be a common theme here. You spend most of your actual time on campus, preparing to get off campus and it creates less of an impetus to pursue deeper learning and research. That being said, as with everything in life, you get out of it what you put into it.<p>2. Academic Research -<p>Most schools, In my opinion, have good pockets and bad pockets. The fact that the model of scientific research worldwide is pretty broken is well known. Industrial partnerships drive research because that&#x27;s where the money is. At least until we all become millionaires and donate money back to our Universities for no-strings-attached research :D It also depends on the professor. Some professors choose to fund themselves off government grants that give them less money and more freedom while others choose to work with large companies like GM on industrial research projects. You need to find the professor that aligns with your interests. I was lucky enough to work on robotic path planning and multi-robot cooperation without any industrial interests breathing down my neck but that doesn&#x27;t always happen of course.<p>The good thing about a Waterloo master&#x27;s is that it is guaranteed to be fully funded by the University and, based on merit, you can choose to do either a course-based master&#x27;s or a thesis-based master&#x27;s. This is unlike American universities because we drive our own research for the entirety of our program. Being just a master&#x27;s student I&#x27;ve published as a first author in most of the major robotics conferences and journals (ICRA, IROS, JFR, TRO, WAFR) and not many master&#x27;s students in other Universities have the opportunity to do that.",1410281280

Generally, positions like what you describe are either politically protected: a manager with a large number of reports has more &quot;importance&quot; than a manager with few, so some managers try to inflate their staff, or, the position has just slipped through the cracks as times change around it.<p>The problem comes when you&#x27;ve been in that position for 10 years, doing little to no significant work, not building or honing any skills, and suddenly a new management comes in and cleans house, and you&#x27;re gone.  Now what?<p>I work for the government and we have a lot of folks like what you describe, but with less income. As long as they show up for work and answer a few emails, mostly, they can get by.  This works, I guess, if you&#x27;re just a few years from retiring.  But we do sometimes get aggressive politicians in office who promise to &quot;cut the fat&quot;, and we have had cuts and layoffs in the past.  So imagine yourself,  at 25, you take a position and intentionally don&#x27;t learn, don&#x27;t advance, and just do the minimum to collect the salary.<p>10 years later, you&#x27;re 35 and still working with Java 6 on some legacy system that needs 2 hours a week of maintenance.  That&#x27;s your whole job.  Suddenly, some political upheaval happens and a bunch of folks, including you, are laid off.<p>Can you get back in the game?  Of course.  Would it be a lot easier to get back in if you took that time to keep your skills at least somewhat up to date?<p>That said, I&#x27;m very sympathetic. I&#x27;m a computer programmer because I&#x27;ve always been good at it.  When I was a kid, and in high school, and so on. That&#x27;s the only skill I learned. But I don&#x27;t like computers. New frameworks don&#x27;t excite me, they make me feel tired. When I go home, I don&#x27;t want to play with the newest technology or even gadget.  I dream of getting out of computing all together, but, nothing else would bring the salary combined with the light workload.  It&#x27;s a &quot;bronze handcuffs&quot; situation (I say bronze, because, as a government worker, my salary is too low to qualify for anything else).  I had a job for a while teaching remedial basic math to adults, which was pretty neat, but it was part-time, no-benefits, low wage.  That&#x27;s the kind of thing that is fulfilling, but doesn&#x27;t pay the mortgage.<p>Even so, I read HN.  I sometimes do make time to try new ideas, even small ones.

I&#x27;m on the Dart team, so I&#x27;m obviously biased, but here&#x27;s what I like:<p>1. The language is statically shaped, meaning classes and methods have a declarative, not imperative syntax. It means that tools can understand the classes and operations in your program just by parsing it. That makes nice code navigation (go to definition, find callsites, etc.) easy where I&#x27;ve never found it to work well in JS.<p>Note that this isn&#x27;t about static types and type annotations and stuff like that. It&#x27;s just about being declarative versus imperative. I also find declarative code much easier to read than JS&#x27;s soup of SomeType.prototype.someMethod = function() { ... }<p>2. It has a really nice standard library. Solid collections with lists, maps, sets. Lots of higher-order functions for transforming them. Futures and asynchronous streams are built right into the core library (and used by the DOM!). A much cleaned up DOM library. For basic mucking around with data, I don&#x27;t need to lean on third-party libraries in Dart like I do in JS.<p>3. Static typing help find a lot of my bugs early. I don&#x27;t annotate local variables, but even annotating at method boundaries is enough to find all of my dumb typos. It also gives me auto-complete for methods, which is a huge time-saver when working with unfamiliar code.<p>4. Lots and lots of little nice language features: getters and setters, final, lazy-initialized top level variables, string interpolation, => lambdas, correct binding for this, solid block lexical scope, etc.",1410279584

To be clear, I think this work is very useful and appreciated though.  As someone that spends almost all of every working day in terminals on remote systems, often as root, I applaud any effort to reduce catastrophic mistakes.  Every time I have to rm -rf as root there&#x27;s that little after-I-hit-enter-panic, where I have to assure myself I double checked and didn&#x27;t accidentally just delete /bin.

8290826,comment,8290563,8290563,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"By and large I have concluded that except in extraordinary situations that job doesn&#x27;t exist. Sure a lot of people will look at job from the outside, not knowing what it entails, and make statements/generalizations about it requiring no work to pull down some big salary, but having been on both sides of that window my experience was that it was an illusion.<p>That said, at an abundant salary and a young age, you can go the mr money moustache route. Save your way into an early retirement. That is probably the easiest thing to do, then any money you make from working is just &#x27;bonus&#x27; and you can take jobs that pay less, don&#x27;t challenge you much, and are perhaps less stressful. I expect you will get bored though.<p>The situations where you can get a sinecure (the name for the job type your looking for) is when you are in a relationship with the ownership and simply your presence is valuable enough to justify your salary. Some very large names in a field for example can get by with just having their name on the employee list as their &#x27;value&#x27; to the company. You can also find spots in companies which are actually covers for a differently funded activity. An acquaintance of mine worked at a restaurant which was used to launder cash from some criminal group. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of business so they didn&#x27;t have to do a lot of work, but they got paid anyway. Granted it was at a much much lower wage but I expect there are larger companies with similar alternate agendas.",1410278511

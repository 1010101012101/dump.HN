36940,comment,36878,36878,0,0,stuki,,,"	Theoretically, as search engines and advertisers both get more and more sophisticated, the organic and paid for links should converge. The most 'relevant' results for (search term, searcher history, other relevant data) indicating someone looking to buy something will be the sellers most likely to convert the given searcher. At the same time, advertisers would be unwilling to pay for clicks from searches indicating unlikely buyers.\n	If matching ever get that sophisticated, some altruistic sounding blurb about keeping commercial links off the organic section probably won't be far behind, however.\n",1185482908
36939,story,,,2,2,zynoda,"What rights do I have over my domain name?",,"I bought a domain name about two years ago for a little web app I've been working on. For conversation sake lets call it Umize. Recently, a new startup launched with a similar name (Umizr). <p>Here's what bothers me: they use my name (Umize) as the title of one of their features. And this title is displayed prominently on their front page and throughout their web site. The feature is also somewhat related to my web app.<p>My question is: do I have any copyright for the use of my domain name? Do I have the right to ask the startup to rename their feature?<p>I'm not planning on taking any action now. I'm just wondering what my options are if this becomes a problem in the future.<p>Thanks so much!",1185482664
36936,comment,36905,36905,0,0,vlad,,,"Just yesterday I had a thought about the link between Paul and Lisp.  I came to the conclusion that since Paul was a published author of Lisp books at the time, and saw an opportunity to use it in production (maybe to gain experience and write another book about it to share his findings with others) but ended up learning about startups, dot coms, investors, and users as well, he instead wrote essays on paulgraham.com and used some of them in his Hackers and Painters book.<p>I dare say his essays are about starting up in general, and there is no secret plan to convert users into using Lisp.  Every week on YCombinator Startup News, somebody asks about learning Lisp to do a web app, when there are way more other things to worry about than the language.  Use something you want to use every day, not just in theory because someone else did.  I'd learn an unknown language if I was at a startup that used it every day, but otherwise, I would default to using a web framework that I have already used in the past.<p>My conclusion is that if you're creating a web application using a web framework in any language you find interesting at the moment, go for it.  Because that's exactly what Paul did.  It just happened to be Lisp that he was an expert at, but it could have been any other exciting technology.<p>Whether Paul would use Lisp today or not on a new project is irrelevant as far as your plate is concerned.  He could use Lisp, but it wouldn't mean that there aren't other good alternatives.  And if he did use a language other than Lisp, maybe it would be so because he would want to learn web framework since he wouldn't be writing Lisp books any more, but Lisp may still be something he would normally use more often.<p>I think this is a great question.",1185482542

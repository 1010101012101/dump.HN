The point of writing something is generally to communicate with others, unless it&#x27;s a personal journal or diary, meant to be kept private.<p>That&#x27;s what Hegel and Heidegger did. They communicated with others. It&#x27;s just that their thoughts are more complicated.<p>> Isn&#x27;t it much more likely that the difficulties are more due to the fact they are beginners, than due to the language used in the course? Did you teach identical material using other languages, and found the students understood the material better? (Honestly curious.)<p>The experience is that 10% of a course were able to write some Lisp. 40% struggled with the tasks, but made it somehow. The rest more or less did not get more than the basics and were confused by things like &#x27;code is data&#x27;, recursion for iteration, ...<p>> Meta-programming in Ruby has the same challenges<p>Meta-programming in Ruby is very limited to what Lisp does enable. Matz designed Ruby for &#x27;ordinary programmers&#x27; (his words). Ruby lacks the whole Code-is-Data idea and on the OOP side, it lacks many of the features of a MOP, ...

People have done it: Standard Lisp, Logo, Dylan, Eulisp, ISLisp, Scheme, Clojure, ... Some were more scaled down that others.<p>Common Lisp stayed like it ever was: a language with lots of flexibility and extensibility.<p>> There&#x27;s nothing about the language itself hindering broader adoption, or limiting it&#x27;s use to academics or elite programmers<p>I&#x27;ve seen research programmers struggling debugging macros which were writing macros. There are code bases where I myself struggle debugging stuff... Common Lisp is great, but it offers so many ways to shoot yourself into the foot....",1410159486

When this happens a couple of times in a row, they may start to question their own ability.<p>It&#x27;s easy to shrug off a couple of bad beats as &quot;running against the top of opponent&#x27;s range&quot;. Hit a string of these hands and suddenly you&#x27;re beginning to question your reads. Has the tone of the table changed and you missed it? Do you need to adapt quickly and if so, how? And perhaps most important of all, have you already done that without realising it?<p>In the long run the game is an infinite series of calculated risks. There is no trick to winning, other than having a strong enough bankroll, and to be better than majority of the field.<p>In this context, bankroll also includes mental capacity to deal with the blows. As long you&#x27;re doing everything, or even most things right, probabilities will catch up.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make the game any easier, though.",1410159453

8283665,comment,8281999,8283362,2,0,shmerl,,,"<i>> Why should the future of internet streaming be DRM free? </i><p>Because there is no good reason to use DRM. Ever.<p><i>> But for streaming video I&#x27;m merely renting.</i><p>You mix up the concept of streaming with renting. A common mistake that for some reason a lot of people make.<p>Streaming is simply a convenience. An ability to watch something from the cloud without downloading it first. Who said it has to be equal to renting? You can perfectly buy something and have it stored in the cloud to stream it while being able to save it for local backup at the same time. That&#x27;s exactly what GOG offer for their DRM-free video.<p>Now with streaming misunderstanding out of the way let&#x27;s take a look at renting. First of all using DRM for renting is pointless. If it&#x27;s intended to prevent potential abuse of renting terms, then it&#x27;s worthless same way it&#x27;s worthless to prevent any piracy in general since those who want can access all the same content through piracy sources at any time. So any kind of enforcement of renting with DRM is futile and only reduces usability of the product for nothing.<p>Now let&#x27;s also review the concept of renting itself. It doesn&#x27;t really make any sense for digital goods in general. For physical merchandise renting allows reusability, which allows in term using lower price for renting in comparison with selling since there is no repeated cost of production. For digital goods this problem is non existent because cost of reproduction is practically non existent (digital copying). So there is no good reason to make the price of selling any higher than the price of renting. Or in other words, the whole concept of renting is nonsensical for digital goods. It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to always allow the user to back up their data if they want to (i.e. complete purchase, not a rent).<p>Now with renting out of the way let&#x27;s take a look at Netflix. Essentially their novelty is not in the renting aspect, but in an interesting way of organizing the service. Instead of selling film per price, they give access to anything for a monthly fee. This can perfectly be done without falling into renting approach (which can push one to entertain the thought of DRM which is nonsensical anyway as above). Some say, that if you remove DRM from Netflix what would stop users from downloading the whole catalog within the monthly period? The answer to that is that DRM is still not needed, Netflix should just make terms of usage more realistic and use other, non DRM methods to prevent such abuse. I.e. instead of saying &quot;watch what you want in any amount by paying N money a month&quot; they can say &quot;watch / download up to M films by paying N money a month. If you want more - pay extra&quot;. That would keep basically similar approach but would prevent potential &quot;download it all&quot; abuse, while at the same time remain DRM-free. And there is no need to turn it into renting. I.e. those M films can be made perfectly downloadable and backupable. Since the main expense for Netflix is the streaming (it eats bandwidth / server activity resources), letting users back video up is perfectly fine - it will only reduce costs by reducing load if users will decide to watch their local backups next time.<p>The bottom line, Netflix can offer a DRM-free streaming service which allows downloads at the same time and uses their approach of &quot;watch what you want for a monthly fee&quot; except with an addition of &quot;not more than M videos per month. If you want more - pay an additional fee&quot;.",1410158527

Maybe &quot;you&#x27;d expect&quot; means what you think; maybe not.<p>Independent of my or your opinion, (or precisely because reasonable people may disagree over something so simple) the writing is unnecessarily unclear. It would be simple to add a quick note saying, more-or-less, that the author will revisit the point later.<p>I also disagree with another commenter who says that the later writing clears up this issue. The point about 33% not being a fair assumption isn&#x27;t addressed head on in the way that I think matters most.<p>Here is my main point, which was not received in the spirit I intended. Many smart people, even programmers, sometimes incorrectly assume a discrete uniform distribution (e.g. 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in the above example), probably because they think it makes the fewest assumptions.<p>I&#x27;ll put it another way with a related example. Alexa gives Bart a two-sided coin, tells him it may or not be fair, and asks the expected probability of getting heads. Bart reasons as follows: &quot;I know that the coin may be unfair, ranging from, say, 0%/100% to 50%/50% to 100%/0%. By symmetry, for each 1%/99% coin there is a 99%/1% coin. So, in the end, the coin will average out to 50/50, so the best answer is 50%.&quot;<p>Chuck comes along and says, &quot;Bart got it wrong. Any point estimate must be incorrect, because we don&#x27;t have enough information. The correct answer must be a distribution. Since we know nothing, the best answer is a flat (uniform) distribution ranging from 0% to 100%.&quot;<p>Danielle chimes in and adds &quot;Yes, Bart was wrong, and Chuck improved on the analysis, but Chuck did not go far enough. Both Bart and Chuck assumed symmetry, without justification. Chuck&#x27;s act of assuming a uniform distribution is tantamount to knowing the process that generated the coin. Does Chuck really know the chances of a 0-10% coin are the same as a 10-20% coin, and so on? No, he does not. Therefore, even answering the question with a distribution is incorrect. The only correct answer is that the probability of heads ranges from 0 to 100%, but no distribution can be given.&quot;<p>Danielle is correct. The author may well know this, but it is not communicated clearly in the article.<p>I would be willing to wager that many people, when confronted with Alex&#x27;s question, would answer like Bob or Chuck did.",1410156342

Google was not (and by a long shot) the first to think of and try to develop self driving technology. I&#x27;m disappointed to see technical people in silicon valley not think a bit more critically. All OEMs and many tier 1 suppliers have thought about and (especially larger players) tried to build self driving cars. When you&#x27;re a company like Denso or Bosch, this is a massive opportunity and not to aim a few people of your hundreds of thousands of employees to the problem is hard to imagine even if you know nothing about automotive. To be clear when I worked at Bosch from 2004-06, this tech was in development.<p>Secondly, the HN crowd specifically is notably biased. Check out Google self driving announcements vs GM (or any news about automotive manufactures other than Tesla). Having worked at both companies in product and engineering - yes they are of course different. But not nearly as much as you think. The single most notable difference is that Google is a very margin rich business. That allows the company to attract and retain top talent but it doesn&#x27;t mean engineers that doesn&#x27;t work at Google are bozos.<p>Thirdly, the technology that traditional OEMs have tried to develop is around 2 axis - cost and safety. Google is approaching the problem differently. Google&#x27;s approach of a $x0,000 LiDAR system might prove to work if LiDar costs fall but thats a big risk. Also, Google admits that their cars don&#x27;t work in things like rain. I&#x27;m not saying Google won&#x27;t win this space - the contrary, I think they have a great shot. What i&#x27;m saying is this is significantly complex tech and its complexity is hard to understate. There can and will be different solutions that work.<p>Lastly, GM and Google are not the only ones in the game. Nissan and Mercedes have announced they will have cars with similar tech in 2017/18. Ever single automotive player is investing huge amounts of resources.",1410156330

Typically, depression gets worse as stress increases (like in a matter of you having to go to court, I know mine did when I had to at one point). Also, a lot of people with depression develop thoughts of suicide and the notion that it may be the only escape from the pain. So I wouldn't call Aaron's case ""textbook suicide"". One might reason that had he not been subject to such stress by our justice system his suicide would be delayed if not prevented, but I wouldn't go as far as saying he died knowing he would be a ""martyr"".

5051801,comment,5051407,5051733,14,0,rayiner,,,"You're conflating two very different things. This was no case of overzealous prosecution based on vague laws for the kind of activity that everyone does every day. Swartz purposefully accessed a protected computer network without permission, and purposefully copied a huge number of documents which he had no right to copy. He did all of these things willfully, with no defense that he was incapable of understanding the implications of his actions. It is disingenuous to say that breaking into MIT's network to download millions of documents illegally is no different than the kind of activity that you and I might do every day that ""technically"" violate various laws.<p>Now, maybe you think ""breaking in"" to a poorly protected network should not be a crime. Maybe you think mass copying of copyrighted materials should not be a crime. But if you take action like Swartz did to protest these laws, you are engaging in an act of civil disobedience and inviting prosecution. And sometimes that's justified, but being prosecuted is part and parcel of civil disobedience.<p>The rhetoric around this unfortunate incident borders on intellectually dishonest. Our democratically-elected Congress has passed laws, and under those laws breaking into a poorly-protected network isn't any less ""hacking"" than breaking into a poorly-protected house is trespassing. Those laws also say that scientists own the copyright to their papers, and can license them to distributors, even when their research is paid for with public grant dollars.<p>The prosecutor in this case pursued her case according to the law. Not some technical ""letter of the law"" definition of the law, but in response to exactly the kinds of actions the laws were designed to address. Our democratically-elected Congress chose to make those specific things that Swartz did illegal.<p>That doesn't mean that no one is on the hook. But it's not the relatively simple matter of stopping overzealous prosecution in one agency. The techie community has a far bigger task: convincing elected officials and those that vote for them that there are degrees to ""hacking"" and that publicly funded research should be freely available. That's the root of the issue here.",1358109906

If people vote for whoever their union leader or ""community organizer"" or local party hack tells them to vote for - they shouldn't blame ""the wealthy"" when their lives do not improve. They should blame themselves. Congress approval ratings are in the shitter, yet the chance of an entrenched incumbent to be reelected are still high - even those in the middle of corruption scandals and bribery investigations. Same people get reelected for years, especially in mono-party environments. And people who elect them always blame somebody else for the inevitable failure.<p>>>>>  And you say voters want more people in jail?<p>If they didn't, politicians would be afraid to talk about more restrictive laws and more criminal prosecutions. For example, racism is despised by a large percentage of US population - at least open, overt racism - and show me one politician that is playing on the national scene and is openly racist? Does not happen. Did the wealthy do it? Nope, the people did. You want to make the problem of over-jailing become better? Make politicians supporting jailing people for minor offenses as popular as racists.

It is insanely complex and insanely messed up, and I have no slightest idea how to fix it. But I know one thing - blaming abstract ""wealthy"" for problems caused by regular citizens being stupid is not going to fix anything. Adding more stupid to the stupid doesn't make it better.<p>>>>> The statistics are quite clear regarding the increase in lobbying efforts by the wealthy and by large corporations during the 70s.<p>So what? Of course, lobbying is the most profitable investment in the known universe. Of course, there will be more of it. But try to think <i>why</i> it is profitable - who gives the politicians the power that they are selling and lobbyists are buying? The answer is - you do. Take it from them, and they'd have nothing to sell, and corporations would have to go and sell directly to you. Less profitable for them (wholesale is always cheaper, and buying power wholesale is not an exception), but better for you. The only thing you have to do is to get rid of the idea that you should give power to politicians so they solve your problems. If you can't - read your book and see what happens.

There are four things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we want to re-shape science.<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now a lot of the worlds scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.<p>Critical to achieving change in science is understanding how the reputation system works. Competition for funding is intense, and scientists optimize for the kinds of reputation metrics that the funding bodies and hiring committees check for. To achieve instant distribution, better peer review, multi-media sharing, and open sharing, one has to build reputation metrics that encourage that kind of activity.<p>Historically the main reputation metric in science has been the journal title. But over the last 4-5 years, new reputation metrics have emerged in science. Google Scholar pioneered the citation count: it released the count of how many inbound citations your work has received, and scientists started to take that metric and say to their funding committees 'this metric reflects well on me; I would like you to take it into account when evaluating my work'.<p>Academia.edu has been pioneering the introduction of usage metrics: page view counts for your papers. Our users regularly take screenshots of their Analytics Dashboard on Academia.edu and submit them to their tenure committees and funding bodies.  There is a good case of someone including their Academia.edu Analytics in their application for tenure here <a href=""http://blog.academia.edu/post/23302130233/user-spotlight-tim-ritchie-is-using-academia-edu-stats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.academia.edu/post/23302130233/user-spotlight-tim...</a>.<p>In the future there will be a family of reputation metrics in science, each reflecting a different aspect of impact.<p>If you are excited about building this future of science, we are looking for passionate people to join us.

The prosecutor isn't getting the ""benefit of the doubt"" because even a cursory look into her history shows that her office and attorneys (like Steve Heymann) have been railroading defendants and pushing spurious cases (google ""Ortiz Russ Caswell"" or ""Ortiz UIGEA""). Carmen M. Ortiz is a <i>bad person</i> who abused her authority and the public trust; with Steve Heymann she pushed for 35 years in federal prison for downloading pdfs even when JSTOR refused to press charges.

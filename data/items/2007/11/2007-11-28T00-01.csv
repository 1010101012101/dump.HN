84080,comment,83877,83877,0,0,neilc,,,"""the average corporate email user received 126 messages a day""<p>Wow, that seems on the high side to me. I realize you typically tend to get a lot of low-signal mail when working in a corporate environment, but <i>126</i> per day <i>on average</i> is still a little hard to believe.",1196209583

Porn is freely available on the internet.<p>Seriously, though:  I could care less about what shows up on the feeds.  Anyone who would criticize or judge me for what I buy isn't among my friends, in real life or on facebook.  Worried about your boss (as Doctorow says, you pretty much have to friend this one if they come a-courtin') seeing too much?  Just twiddle the privacy settings so he or she only sees the most innocuous of updates.<p>While there are many valid criticisms of facebook, I have never worried once about the ones you listed.  <p>Just my 2 cents.",1196209561

I don't have any quotes or statistics here, but common sense suggests to me that abusers will mark real inappropriate stuff and stuff they just don't agree with.<p>By keeping mum, you also lose the scare effect, though OTOH that might keep the ""I'll just create a bunch of accounts"" folks down.<p>A third risk is that legitimate marks no longer get made because the potential marker doesn't want to risk the ban. However, if the ban is ONLY on the use of the mark as inappropriate button and not for anything else, then I doubt it would actively scare users.<p>",1196208734

Basically, the idea is to make the equivalent of PayPal, but for identity management.<p>For most sites, authentication consists of an e-mail / password combo. Some require you to create a user-name as well, but it's basically a proxy for an e-mail address. The problem is -- a lot of people don't really want to give out their e-mail address. (1) Spam. (2) Linking multiple accounts to the same e-mail provides lots of info for data-miners.<p>To deal with 1, many users already create junk-mail accounts that exist for the sole purpose of signing up for stuff. The problem is that sometimes you want to see SOME of the newsletters those sites send. Leaving them all in the junk account ensures they're buried under all the other stuff. Use your non-junk-mail account and you may not be able to undo the damage later (ever try opting-out of some of the spam messages? PITA sometimes). It also doesn't solve 2.<p>So .. why not create different e-mail addresses for each site you create an account with? Have them all forward to your real e-mail address. When you no longer want spam from a certain source, simply terminate one of the fake e-mail addresses. This would be a pain for a user to do for every single account they created, but an entrepreneurial hacker could create a service that automatically generated fake e-mail addresses, strong passwords, set up any forwarding, and allowed users to track and manage their login info on multiple sites. You would also have to write a browser plugin or something that looked for user-name/e-mail form fields and filled in the proper login info (it'd be unreasonable to expect users to keep track of all the fake e-mail addresses on their own).<p>Just as PayPal allows you to pay without exposing your actual financial information, this would allow you to login without exposing your actual e-mail address. Even better, unlike PayPal or services like OpenID and Windows CardSpace, it requires no change on the part of the actual sites themselves. It's all done on the client-side.<p>For the truly paranoid, you could potentially extend the idea by creating full-blown fake identities (with names, addresses, etc.) for each site you visited, but I suspect you would run afoul of the law here.<p>There's a lot of room of abuse, but I don't see any absolute deal-breakers so far. I'm busy with my own project right now, so if someone's looking for something to do, go for it.",1196208627

He comes up with ideas then licenses them to large corporations. One of the key tools he uses is that he does not sell inventions, he sells benefits.<p>What is the benefit of the OLPC XO?<p>I'll tell you this in one sentence:<p>The OLPC XO gives your child a significant competitive edge.<p>I read the the hardware specs. Those were nice but not compelling. When I read the software specs, I realized that the XO contains many of the ideas that the MIT Media Labs had been trying to get into mainstream computing for years, but failed. A great example is garbage collection. LISP programmers have been using garbage collection for over thirty years or more, but its benefit has only recently reached the programming communities at large through languages such as Python, Ruby, and C#.<p>However, the XO takes garbage collection one step further. It will automatically save revisions of your files and garbage collect that too. When you run out out space, it tells you what junk you should throw out, and you decide what you want to 'keep'. Otherwise you never worry about having to save because the computer might crash in the middle of writing something. There is no other OS that is built to do that from the ground up out on the market. It is one of the many things about the XO that will give a child a competitive edge, having grown up with it.<p>More importantly, when they become adults, they will demand this functionality from mainstream operating systems. Some of them, having grown up with the 'view source' key will have the technical skills and the perseverance to make it happen. If the adults are too clueless to want it, they will go ahead and make it. How's that for competitive edge?<p>When I realized that the main benefit of the XO is to give a child a competitive edge, I found it highly interesting that the original plan called for distributing the XO exclusively to developing nations. Think about that.<p>There has been a long-standing discussion over the decline of the US educational system. A device that gives a US child a non-trivial, competitive edge should have its doors beaten down by their parents ...",1196208175

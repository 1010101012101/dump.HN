6429848,comment,6429325,6429325,78,0,PakG1,,,"I look at UI changes in a totally different way now.  My saw me come online on Skype, so she called me.  There&#x27;s an ocean between us currently.  She said she called me because she was writing an email to me, but couldn&#x27;t find the Send button, so didn&#x27;t know how to send it.  Either it made her feel stupid or frustrated, or she felt so sad that she couldn&#x27;t send an email to me that she had spent some time writing, or whatever, but she started crying.  She was crying because she couldn&#x27;t find the Send button in gmail.  She&#x27;s approaching 60 and isn&#x27;t as technically adept as some of us, so that is admittedly a factor.<p>Seeing her cry about this made me change the way I think about what some users go through when they experience unexpected UI changes.  I remember hearing people say they got confused by Windows 8 tiles, and didn&#x27;t think it was such a big deal.  After seeing my mom cry over a UI change, I think there are better ways to implement UI changes than simply shoving them down people&#x27;s throat.  Sure, if it must be done, it must be done (UI change), but don&#x27;t shove it down people&#x27;s throats unexpectedly and with no hand-holding at all.",1379930234

6429842,comment,6428757,6428757,3,0,netcan,,,"I think this is probably a part of a larger trend in migration. I lived in 2 countries as a child and 2 more as an adult. I&#x27;m 30. I think around 70% of of my coworkers have lived in more than one country. Basically, migration isn&#x27;t an extreme decision anymore. Your lot doesn&#x27;t need to be bad or hopeless to migrate from Germany to Spain or spend a couple of years on Seol. The difference in earnings/lifestyle doesn&#x27;t need to be an order of magnitude. A marginal improvement can be enough to move some people.<p>Wealthy modern states rely quite heavily on the middle class for taxes. Within the middle class you&#x27;ll find groups (eg single, childless, urban Europeans) that pay very high taxes while consuming very few services. They earn via highly taxable salaries. Most of their earnings are consumed and thus subject to GST/VAT and excise taxes. They also play the real estate, credit card, car financing, etc games that funnel money into finical institutions & industries which are so important to the political-economic goals politicians take on.<p>The net result of this is that for a middle class household in a wealthy country, wealth is somewhat of an illusion. Imagine a 30 year old unmarried couple earning 100k - well off on paper. They can expect to pay about 30-35k (depending on how the salary is split) in income tax. 1-2k on flat taxes (car tax, tv tax, local tax). Then 25-40%  of the remaining on a mortgage - say 21k. That leaves 40k-50k per year for taxable spending. Most of this will be taxed at 23%. Some stuff like petrol, alcohol, tobacco & cars will be taxed at a higher rate.<p>These people are still well off. It&#x27;s hard not to be with to above average salaries and no expensive children. But are not near as well off as their earnings suggest they should be.<p>In some Eurpoean countries those taxes prop up a wasteful government. In some, they are paying for recent bank bailouts. In some, they are paying for an expensive legacy welfare state (with corresponding welfare class). In some, they are paying for past infrastructure investments. The best run countries (Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavian countries) do a good job of funneling those revenues to the same people at different stages of their life. Only a portion of most people&#x27;s life is spent in this highly taxable, no need for government services state. But even in these cases it might make sense for a self interested individual to study at the countries expense and then earn outside of their tax jurisdictions.<p>If middle class migration and &#x27;shopping around&#x27; for high quality of living becomes more prevalent, the tax revenue implications are enormous.",1379930131

6429840,comment,6429657,6429657,3,0,beberlei,,,"some feedback from me:<p>1. the value types are not immutable, which will make it very hard to work with them on larger scale. You should create new instances instead of modifying the original ones, keeping the originals intact.<p>2. The object hierachy is borked. You are exposing way to much information. Instead of generically allowing to save values and options in the Object, you should specialize the types much more and hide the actual value.<p>3. You should convert the value when creating the type, using (int) for example, or throw an exception if not convertable.

Although I believe that&#x27;s somewhat true in the U.S., too: while many Valley companies will hire someone without a degree, my impression is that there is a higher bar for hiring someone foreign without a degree. E.g. Google is more likely to sponsor a German degree-holder for a U.S. visa than a German non-degree-holder. The world of good tech jobs without degrees is a lot easier to unlock (in both the U.S. and Europe) for permanent residents / citizens.<p>Yeah, I wouldn&#x27;t leave the Valley if you want to make a higher salary, unless it&#x27;s a jump to some kind of high-level management position. The Valley has pretty much the highest tech salaries afaik. Switzerland might come close.<p>You might come out ahead in some places in lifestyle after cost of living, but it depends on your lifestyle. A nice thing about Copenhagen is that, while it&#x27;s expensive to live in the city, it&#x27;s not NYC/SF levels of expensive (or Paris/London, for that matter). It&#x27;s maybe $1500-$2000/mo for a nice centrally located 2bd... rather than the $3000+ my friends in SF pay. And you can buy a condo for maybe $300k, which last I checked was completely impossible in SF.<p>As far as private universities, there aren&#x27;t any: only state schools are accredited. There are some private professional institutes, like an animation school and a film school, but they aren&#x27;t allowed to give degrees (instead they give their own certificates), and are seen as a different kind of thing.<p>The time limit for the student stipend is the regular length of the degree, with possibility in some circumstances to get another 6 months. So, 3 years for the bachelor&#x27;s, plus 2 years for the master&#x27;s. A hard max (after both degrees and extensions on both) of 6 years.<p>Typically students will do the two together as one five-year program; you <i>can</i> stop after the bachelor&#x27;s, but the traditional Danish first degree was a 5-year degree (called a candidature), which is still sort of expected. The 3-year bachelor&#x27;s/2-year master&#x27;s split was introduced in 1993 to harmonize with other EU countries&#x27; systems, but a bachelor&#x27;s on its own is still seen as not quite complete education (may change as memories of the old 5-year candidature fade).",1379927018

The painful part was the graphical editor, or, I&#x27;d say, the idea of using graphics for programming instead of text. Imagine aligning all these rectangles and then realizing that you got a part of algorithm wrong: now you&#x27;ll have to realign everything!<p>I think it would be much easier to edit some textual representation, and then use a program to convert it to the graphical one, if you want to read it this way.",1379927001

Maybe your company has patents covering RStudio software and wants to go suing its customers. That would indeed pose a problem with AGPLv3.<p>Maybe your company produces devices which have web servers in them, and those servers are going to host &quot;toy&quot; pages which uses Shiny, <i>and the devices are locked down with DRM which prevent modification to Shiny</i>. I guess it would be possible...<p>Or maybe the company does not want to ever give out code under any circumstances, regardless if it&#x27;s a toy project with no inherent value to the company. This is clearly possible, which is why a dual licensing scheme sometimes is a good choice.<p>I am intensively curious about which one it is.",1379926950

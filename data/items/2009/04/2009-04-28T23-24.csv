Well my first piece of advice is to slack off in school, if you can. DO all of your homework, but only due the minimum. Just aim to get above 75% in all of your classes. You may not be able to get amazing scholarships with this mark, but you can graduate and get into College.
Now what i would recommend to make your life more enjoyable: Find something to do that you love and do it
I co-founded a web design company (Kerplunc.com) with a friend of mine in the UK, i run a successful web hosting company (KerpluncHosting.com) and run a blog/webcomic with a bunch of my friends (ExplodingWumpus.com).
I'm not sure if your loves are going to be anything similar to that, but that's what i love to do.
If you want someone to talk to about this kinda stuff, or just someone to discuss nerdy shit with, feel free to email me (matt@kerplunc.com) and i can give you my MSN etc.<p>Oh and don't start doing drugs or partying",1240962994

For example, reading one of the links referenced in the OP, it says<p><i>""It doesn’t simply return documents that (might) contain the answers, like Google does, and it isn’t just a giant database of knowledge, like the Wikipedia. It doesn’t simply parse natural language and then use that to retrieve documents, like Powerset, for example.

I am guessing since everybody is very excited about Wolfram Alpha that there must be more than this, or qualitatively different.<p>[Edit following comment below: I am not saying they are competing, I was asking whether the same underlying technology is powering both, for example with Wolfram being a more complex version of whatever GoogleLookup is doing, or whether the algorithmic approach is fundamentally different.

Because it technically meets the province's definition of a power assisted ""e-bike"", you get a slow speed scooter without the hassle of licensing and insurance requirements. They allow a lot of freedom because you can legally ride in both bicycle and car lanes, and park almost anywhere. People are also illegally removing the 32km/h regulator (among other hacks), which is difficult for the police to enforce.

Particularly since it gives me insight into what lots of people are yelling about.<p>For example, look at the unemployment rate, and click Alaska (where I live) & California (where half the web seems to think that everyone lives).<p>We see that employment in AK is highly cyclic with a yearly cycle, that there isn't a whole lot of variation otherwise, and that current unemployment is a tad high, but not outlandishly so, and not the highest in the last 20 years.<p>On the other hand, unemployment in CA in not very cyclic, has significant variation on a scale of 5-10 years, and has recently gone shooting up to the highest level in 20 years.<p>So perhaps both sides can understand each other a little better.<p>P.S. Also compare California and Wyoming. And then stop wondering why some of the people in Wyoming don't seem worried.",1240959979

Serious question - I am not sure if men actually have the better deal in our world...<p>Not claiming that there is no discrimination against women, but I also don't think it is obvious that there is. I highly doubt discrimination is the reason behind the low numbers of women in tech, for example.",1240959939

Native uses the system API and follows your system options, like when deciding on how to antialias. Embedded uses the embedded fonts with the antialiasing method the developer chooses. Many developers pick the latter because they want to know exactly how text will work on all platforms.<p>It's up to the developer to select which method to use. And the new flash.text.engine.* API make both a lot more powerful.<p>> Second, copy-paste, as others have pointed out, is a problem (...) enough apps out there fail to enable it properly<p>Like the first one, this becomes a developer choice, not a platform problem. It's not that ""it can be done"", it's that it's easy. People who don't do it, don't do it because it's the option they've picked, not because it's difficult or anything.<p>Your third point totally stands as having a separate DOM kills the user's control over the content and its form. But point 1 and 2 are due to conscious developer decisions and not the technology.",1240959850

The prime example here is Microsoft, which started in Albuquerque (a tech hub at the time) and moved to Seattle (not a tech hub at the time). Bill Gates is the first person that comes to mind in terms of being 'relentlessly resourceful,' as this move was for the intention of being closer to home, not for business reasons, AFAIK.",1240959725

2524987,comment,2524975,2524975,9,0,michaelpinto,,,"My guess is that Jobs would have made his killing by selling Pixar to Disney  and would be CEO of that company. The funny thing about NeXT and Pixar is that they re-energized two giant companies. By the way had Disney purchased Pixar they might also have grabbed NeXT and that company (sort of like Sony) could be in the computer biz.<p>It's also interesting to note that the founders of Google were interested in Steve Jobs as CEO when they first started  so they may have purchased NeXT to do that and poor Eric Schmidt would have been out in the cold these last few years.<p>As for Apple without Jobs my guess is that they could either have faded or ""just held on"" by adopting the Be Inc. operating system (and perhaps Jean-Louis Gasse as well). My guess is that if Apple was in fade mode they would have been merged with Sun or purchased by Oracle.",1304816155
2524986,comment,2523824,2524062,8,0,bane,,,"A trait I've noticed when working with or arguing with the products of elite universities is the incessant ability to respond to most challenges in the form of a blank stare. Harvard grads in particular, but I've noticed it in some military officers as well.<p>They won't get riled up, they won't back down, they won't...well...do anything in particular.<p>While being incredibly infuriating, it also makes them nearly impossible to read or assess. Are they smart? Are they dolts? No idea!<p>This enigma-like quality <i>can</i> get one very far in certain contexts. The ability to operate in elite positions, without becoming ruffled is a tremendously valuable skill.<p>The downside of course is that if things really do go pear shaped, the normal response is to show some kind of stress reaction and hopefully buckle down and get to work. Not acting like there is anything in particular going on just makes those around you wonder if the ol' gears are actually turning at all. Are they out of touch? Do they care? It can be tremendously demotivating to those around.<p>A company I worked for early in my carerr had to let two people with this trait go (both top-tier uni graduates) because the management didn't think they were taking a then current crisis seriously enough. We came to find that with both of them, they were effectively doing no work at all as there was almost no extra work that came out of their leaving.<p>When asked why they were kept around for so many years, promoted etc., management simply responded that they seemed well poised, like they knew what was going on, attended tons of meetings, sent out lots of email...so it <i>looked</i> like they were burning furnaces of activity.<p>When the crisis struck, they kept plodding along this track, scheduling meetings, refusing to let them run long, sending out dozens of emails a day, long after the rest of the team had changed behavior patterns to deal with the issue. It became such a nuisance, especially the content free, but tightly scheduled meetings, that they were finally put under higher scrutiny.<p>It's a office-space-esque/dilbert-esque lesson I've kept with me through my career and have run into this trait dozens of times.<p>I've personally found it so infuriating a trait to work with that I'm loath to hire people from certain majors in certain universities under the assumption there is some kind of communications coursework that teaches people to respond with this blank stare.<p>I've coined the term ""the management stare"" for this phenomenon.<p>On the other hand, the people who I've found to be top performers were consistently the dynamic, emotive people in an organization. They responded rapidly and naturally to changing conditions, showed outward emotions and got really emotionally involved in conversations, meetings and tasks. They brought an energy to the company that drove the rest of their peers along with them.",1304816139

It (JRebel) uses an agent to do the hot swapping instead of modifying the jvm.<p>I grabbed DECVM (and unfortunately I had to grab ICED Tea to run it on OS X, so this limits my use) and it works wonderfully so far.  The only thing that JRebel does offer, that perhaps some of us will figure out for DECVM, is reloading Spring configurations.  Since a lot of us are using DI, the DECVM tool only gets us to point, then the wonderful JVM restart has to happen.",1304813586

You can't even guarantee that MX didn't immediately route the message to /dev/null after accepting it from your server.

    This couldn't be more wrong... The reasons why an interviewer throws you
    a brain teaser or design question is to understand your thought logic
    and problem solving skills. While you talk through how you would solve
    your problem, they are assessing your communication skills, your process
    in solving a problem and also what knowledge you have as part of your
    experience.
</code></pre>
The problem here is that a lot of the brain-teasers I've seen bandied about for interviews are the kind of problems where you either get them via an a-ha insight, or you don't get them at all. That's kind of what makes them good brain-teasers.",1304813116

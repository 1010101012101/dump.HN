Rust is a completely different animal than Go yet I think both are awesome!<p>The idea that all languages have to cater to all people is silly.  Generics are ALWAYS a trade-off.  None is hard for developers, C++ style is terrible for compile (tons of code-gen, macro crap, duplication, de-duplication stages), and Java style (box-box-box-box) is slow at runtime.<p>The misunderstanding that generics are free and there lack of inclusion was an oversight rather than a choice is misguided.  The Go team aren&#x27;t fresh faced neophytes, they move with purpose.<p>Additionally -- if you want lots of features, there are LOTS of ways great languages for you!

First, the number of\n   commercially available standards of secondary metabolites\n   reported to be present in a specific plant species or\n   tissue is low. Second, in an automated online separation,\n   PDA detection, MS measurement, and/or MS/MS fragmentation\n   of mass signals, it is difficult to meet optimized levels\n   for all eluting compounds. Due to overlapping compounds,\n   low intensity mass signals, or difficulties in the\n   isolation of the mass signal for MS/MS fragmentation,\n   the extraction of usable information for identification\n   purposes can be complicated. Third, the lack of dedicated\n   software and databases that integrate spectroscopic and\n   MS data limits the identification procedure to a manual\n   level. Nevertheless, by these means 43 metabolites could be\n   readily assigned in the tomato fruit extract (Tables III\n   and IV), leaving more to be identified.

Reliability, Locking and Data security (not losing data) are never first priorities on their to-do list, they just push new features and busy doing marketing propaganda about how web-scale mongodb is(which is fake).

I tried the latest 2.0.1 release, and it's still cause data loss. Every time I sync a new slave, I pray to god, hoping not lose data.<p>How come a DB lose data so frequently and it sill call itself web-scale? It just breaks when you need scale!<p>For auto-sharding it's also super unreliable, tried once and it failed, and now we are using a lib that do application level sharding. We are also considering move to other databases that at least know not losing data is the first and most important thing of a DB.<p>Some one summarized the issues of mongodb, <a href=""http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=FD3xe6Jt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=FD3xe6Jt</a> , we experienced most problems in the article.

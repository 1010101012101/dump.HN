Your argument is that processed food is bad for you and cheaper because of production scale and I completely agree.  My point is that if I take two meals and put them in front of someone, one with a red steak wrapped in bacon and vegetables and one is a hamburger and fries, I suspect most people will chose the high fat meat and veggies.  However, the government has been pushing the food pyramid <a href=""http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pmap.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pmap.htm</a> as a school indoctrination program for as long as I can remember.  As far as I can tell that hamburger fits right in with your six to 10 servings of bread a day, and they would tell you it's the bacon that is making you fat and giving you heart disease.  So yes, cheaper food is worse for you generally speaking but that is about economics, not evolutionary tastes.",1339009186

     Hello, world.

[xargs] allows you to pipe the output of one command as an argument to another command.  By default it will show up at the tail end of the second command's arg list, but if you want to interleave it you can use -I flag:<p><pre><code>    $ echo /usr/share/dict/words | xargs head -5

     A
     A's
     AOL
     AOL's

    $ echo petard | xargs -I {} grep {} /usr/share/dict/words
     petard
     petard's
     petards
</code></pre>
[xargs node -e] therefore allows text from STDIN to inserted into a script to be evaluated by the node interpreter, accessible via process.argv:<p><pre><code>    $ echo is dog this yes | xargs node -e ""console.log(process.argv.slice(1).sort().reverse().join(' ').toUpperCase())""

There is some ground between the perfect tenant and the idiot who burns a place down. There are all those people in the middle that go about their lives and little things happen. But have you ever heard the saying ""drive it like its a rental""? People will naturally be slightly more careful with things they own or have a direct responsibility to take care of. The more people you have using a space that are not directly responsible for its care, the more likely those little things will happen. We're not talking about the catastrophic damage. We're talking about things like the extra nicks in the banister caused by someone dragging their suitcase up the stairs. When you have a new person dragging their suitcase up (and then back down) the stairs once a week, the chances for additional nicks goes up. Eventually all those little things start to build up. And it is pretty easy for a one of those rotating guests that caused a little more damage to just move along since its not their apartment building. People who live there and have a responsibility for the place (and coincidentally have been vetted) are more likely to notify the landlord to get it corrected.",1339008942

Everything about the system would work as a standalone service, save one component: authentication and authorization.<p>Stop and look at the moving parts for a moment. HBO isn't letting cable providers deliver HBO content through cableco apps. HBO has their own dedicated service and applications. When I want to view HBO content, the experience is HBO from beginning to end; save the login page to my content provider. The cable company's role feels a lot like an OAuth provider.<p>HBO is in the content business, and they know it. I wish I could find it, but I recently read an interview with an HBO executive where he very eloquently expressed the current HBO business model. Essentially, cable companies serve as channel sales agents for HBO content. HBO knows that consumers want their content, but opening a direct channel risks their current (and very profitable) channel.<p>Now take another step back. If the cable companies are merely a sales channel for HBO, what does that say about HBO's long term positioning. Keep in mind that HBO is doing a great job keeping the cable providers in that role, even from a technology standpoint. I think that HBO is putting themselves in a position to jump from one sales channel to another as soon as those channels are capable of supporting their business, or at least capable of mitigating the significant risk posed by alienating the channel that currently delivers 89% of their operating revenue.<p>EDIT: Here is the article I was recalling: <a href=""http://dcurt.is/hbo-forbes-journalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dcurt.is/hbo-forbes-journalism</a>. And a relevant excerpt.<p>> What you don't want to do is to pursue a distribution channel over here [ed: the internet], where you think, well, let's go around the affiliate and we'll get a couple hundred thousand subs. But the promotional, and packaging support we get over here [ed: the affiliate networks], which, by the way, is the foundation of our 30 million subs and enables us to get 10 million transactions, if that dissipates, and that shrinks, then we will lose a lot of subs over here. Because with 10 million transactions, you have to generate a lot of subs every single day. You can't afford to have that machinery slow down. So we'll gain a little over here, and we'll lose a lot over here, and we think there will not be a net gain, there would be a net loss. So it's really about economics and a business issue.<p>Meanwhile, HBO puts themselves in a position to leap when the economics are right. Very savvy, IMO.",1339008173

The basic idea is to intellectual property artificially behave like physical property, so that the market can work.<p>There are a couple of disadvantages to this approach. (1) it makes IP goods more expensive to the consumer than they ""should"" be, so there will be underconsumption compared to what people would consume if the price was lower. (2) people can easily cheat.<p>The major advantage of this approach is that it leaves the decision of what works get made up to the market.<p>The other major way to address the market failure, which is the one Stallman suggests, is that you do artificially make IP act like physical problem, and so go ahead and let the market make and distribute copies without restriction, and address the problem of creation by public funding.<p>This is arguably fair since almost everyone does consume music, movies, and other forms of art. Essentially it is treated as a public good.<p>The advantage of that system is that consumers end up paying close to the marginal cost for their entertainment (i.e., $0), which is the economically ""correct"" price. Another advantage is that it does not rely on people obeying a legal fiction.<p>The disadvantage is that if art is being treated as a public good is that you (1) have to decide on the source of funding, (2) the funding level, and (3) how to distribute the money.<p>For source of funding, the most sensible seems to be some kind of tax specifically for this, probably tied to something that at least vaguely correlates with art consumption.<p>I have no idea how one would go about determining the funding level.<p>For distribution, something based on popularity seems sensible. Note that under this approach, all copying and sharing would be completely legal so there would be no need to try to hide it, so it would be feasible to figure out popularity by sampling network traffic. In fact, since it would be in the interest of content creators to ensure accurate measurement of popularity, I suspect that there would be big official free fast download services sponsored by the content creators, with good search and recommendation features, and most people would download through those rather than use P2P.",1339007637

Expired means the registrar has renewed it for free for X days (it lasts up to like 45 days I think, it depends on registrar's policy).  RGP is expensive expired, the registry charges I think $50 and registrars generally charge $100+.  Then pendingdelete, means it DELETES in 5-6 days depending on registry (verisign/pir... not sure on neustar).<p>If its just expired and NOT RGP, then you have to check for registrar relationships.  Most places call it something like pre-release and have an agreement with a dropcatcher/auction site.  The most popular ones being NameJet, SnapNames, Pool.  Figure out which one has pre-release rights and backorder there.  IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY EXPIRE IF SOMEONE HAS BID ON PRERELEASE.<p>If its hit RGP (redemption grace period) it is going to drop eventually unless the owner renews it.  You can try to contact the owner and buy it that way, it's risky, but it's the only thing happening at that point.<p>PendingDelete means it's expiring.  It will be delete from the registry and whomever orders it fastest will get it.  The original registrar has ZERO advantage at this point.  big companies like namejet/snapnames/pool have a ton of registrar partners who they use all of their connections at once to try and grab these domains.  Most of them allow you to backorder for free and if they catch it, it goes to auction between those who ordered it.  Backorder it for free at ALL of them.  Hopefully one of them catches it and not a private company investing in domains for themselves.<p>Good luck.  If you have any questions I am happy to answer more.",1339006228

But it's completely conceivable that it could happen.<p>But if there are hundreds of apps and services out there storing your contacts (and there will be if you're careless), then it's a virtual certainty that they will be used in ways you didn't attend.<p>It almost seems more likely than not these days that a big trove of personal information will be hacked.  Even if it doesn't contain your credit card numbers, personal information is still extremely valuable because it allows hackers to bypass security questions and reset passwords.<p>EDIT: Haha, front page, huge dump of linkedn PW hashes leaked: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309</a>.  I had written something about LinkedIn probably having ""decent engineers"", and being safer than giving your personal data to a shoddy government website.  But I realize security is more a matter of process than hiring top engineers.  And all these startups in a huge rush.  They're only going to do security right after they're embarrassed.

The RIFT is certainly an improvement (1280800 vs 640x480); we'll see if the ""visual acuity"" twist and improved tracking gives VR the push it needs. Hopefully Carmack (and if anyone can, it's him) can solve whatever the limiting nuance is.<p>Then again, the Newton came out around the same time, and took just as long to be reborn in a viable ""killer app"" form (iPad).

The dogs lose their underfur in summer and can cover long distances then too (you can see this if you do a river trip with the dogs running on the riverbank). You'll also see wolves sometimes cover huge distances very quickly, regardless of season.

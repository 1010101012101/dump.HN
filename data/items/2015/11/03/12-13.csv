I know people all over the world still have thoughts like this, but I thought people on hacker news are smarter than that.<p>#1: Things weren&#x27;t &quot;better&quot; in colonial times anymore than they were better in Apartheid-era South Africa or Jim Crow-era America. Hell, we can even go back to Slavery-era America. Sure, things were more peaceful and ordered. At the expense of the subjugation of a significant percentage of the population.<p>You can absolutely attain peace and prosperity at the expense of the freedom of your citizens. We call that Fascism.<p>#2: Most of the problems that occur in post-colonial hot-spots are not  there because the European colonial administrations left. They are there because THEY WERE THERE IN THE FIRST place.  \nThe Europeans:\n* Deliberately destablized peaceful areas so that they would be the one to introduce order\n* Divided and conquered previously peaceful tribes by boosting support for one in order to attain power (see: Rwanda)\n* Toppled democratically elected governments because of fear of communistic populistic ideas that threatened wealthy western industrialists\n* Created borders abstractly - merging peoples that did not want to be together and dividing those that did.<p>Western countries would not be this far ahead of the rest of the world without decades if not centuries of exploitation. And maybe, just maybe, if progress happened at a more natural rate we would have been able to learn some more sustainable practices.  Maybe we wouldn&#x27;t have the internet or smart phones for another century, but maybe we wouldn&#x27;t have been responsible for The Sixth Extinction.",1446555422

That automatically means they&#x27;re behind the US in technology.<p>2) You can&#x27;t attempt to claim that title without long-range bombers. B1? B2? B52? Anything? The tech, targeting and global deployment capabilities to support all of it? Nope, Singapore has nothing there.<p>3) Their drone programs are very far behind what the US had ten years ago. They&#x27;re relying on weak, short-range Israel UAV tech. The IAI Scout is the core of their drone capabilities and it&#x27;s 40 year old tech. It can only fly to 15,000 feet and at 109 mph. Then the IAI Searcher, which is only capable of 20,000 feet and 125 mph. Those are toy drones.<p>The Global Hawk goes to 60,000 feet, and 357 mph. And that&#x27;s considered old US tech.<p>4) Their global air force integration capabilities are non-existent. That includes complicated logistics and the ability to fly anywhere globally, and refuel for long-range strikes while ensuring the safety of all planes in question.<p>That means the Singapore air force can be destroyed locally without ever posing a threat. That&#x27;s not an advanced air force, it&#x27;s a sitting duck. China would dismantle their air force in a matter of a few days.<p>5) They have no space capabilities at all. That includes the ability to shoot down satellites, a required capability for the next 20+ years to claim an advanced air force. They have no ICBMs, and no other long-range missile capabilities.<p>6) They don&#x27;t have a fraction of the global spying and data gathering (targeting, situation awareness, et al) capability the US air force has.<p>7) They don&#x27;t possess the F22, which is the best fighter jet in existence.<p>8) They&#x27;re incapable of producing the bulk of the hardware that makes up their own air force, including the planes, UAVs, missiles, helicopters, etc. That means they&#x27;re always behind and always will be by default.",1446555123

For example, you have a nice sunset picture but its dark and you can&#x27;t see the people in front. As a result, you try to increase saturation, contrast and exposure. The people&#x27;s faces are still dark so you try to change the exposure more aggressively. That&#x27;s when the picture breaks down. The sky sunset becomes pixelated, maybe the skin becomes white etc. If you use a 8-bit display you wouldn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the effects or because of the 8bit monitor. With a 10-bit display, if it looks crap, at least you know its from the picture you took.<p>This might look an extreme example bit it happens often for photographers and videographers. It can also happen for consumers if they try to check a picture which lots of minimal variations if the same color in the same picture. A good example is a picture of a white sky.

10499171,comment,10498473,10498473,0,0,hnhamdani,,,"As an Indonesian, I&#x27;ll give some context and nuance around the burning.<p>1. Who did the burning? mostly It is CORPORATIONs that owned massive chunks of lands (which some of the case these lands overlap with National Park territories).\nThe rest is small land owners (which also cover big areas if you sum it). These companies though have a strong lobby in the government across layers, whether it is in the national level or province level.\nFYI, many of the companies are foreign ones including Singapore companies and Malaysian companies.<p>2. Why did the government not make it illegal to burn land? \nThere are several factors. Actually the amount of land that CAN BE burnt is limited. However the government do not strictly enforce it, because you know, it&#x27;s Indonesian government.\nSo a step back, how come the government allow people to burn land in the first place? There is an old local bill (in Borneo area) that protect land owner to burn land. This date back\nto an old tradition that in Borneo, in order to farm you gotta burn the land first because of the nature of the peat land itself. I agree that in 2015, there should be a solution in \nmaking a farmland productive without even to burn it. This bill is not yet overruled and even so, being abused by corps to justified the act.<p>3. Another reason why there is almost no response from the Indonesian government is that the burning happened only in Sumatra and Borneo to the (North)West side (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand).\nFor better or worse, Java island doesn&#x27;t get the haze at all, thus many politicians can&#x27;t relate how bad it is actually.<p>What is sad is that it is the epitome of capitalism, that we can&#x27;t do much about it. Palm oil is used everywhere and as long as there is a demand, supply will be there too.",1446554702

However, you do have to manage the GL context yourself - QOpenGLWidget has no 10-bit suppport.  You can still use Qt&#x27;s GL abstractions, just not QOpenGLWidget.

This ensures that, when the next bushfire comes roaring along, it rips through at lightning speed, leaving the core of the tree alive to regrow and eliminating the weaker competition.  It&#x27;s just a bit of a shame if your house happens to be in the way...  and what&#x27;s happening in Indonesia and Singapore right now is basically an intensified, human-supercharged version of the same phenomenon.<p>And FWIW, I lived in Singapore for 8 years and endured some of that haze myself.

We&#x27;ve been happily using Xamarin for a year, even though it was closed. I constantly evaluated other options, including Avian and XMLVM, neither of which came close to either Xamarin or RoboVM in terms of functionality and performance.

If RoboVM stopped the free indie licenses, it would only hurt RoboVM&#x27;s bottom line.<p>The close sourcing was badly communicated, no question about that.

Google still has unlimited storage for photos up to a certain size and 1080p video. Then again they are not using Azure Storage.<p>That Microsoft is having problems with scaling Azure also makes sense of the announcement that they are reducing the free tier storage. If you looked at it from just that they are being abuses by people storing 75tb then reducing the free tier storage does not make sense. However, if they are having issues with the underlying Azure Storage and are wanting to relieve pressure on it, then reducing the amount of storage and the number of accounts because of existing users migrating to other cloud storage providers makes sense.<p>If you are considering Azure for your cloud provider, consider that their halo internal customer OneDrive decided that Azure Storage did not allow them to fulfill what they promised to their customers and they are being forced to cut back at the cost of a huge customer backlash and loss of goodwill.

Getting it to perform well here requires you to figure out how to prune the size of the diff. You&#x27;re doing it by splitting the app state into finer grained trees (each tree is pruning the branches it&#x27;s not listening to) but any gains you&#x27;re picking up from doing this could be done on the single root solution with appropriate shouldComponentUpdate methods.<p>The alternative (and easier) way of reducing the diff size is to simply window your data before passing it into the render, which can work for things like grids and lists but doesn&#x27;t sound like your problem.<p>You also need to occasionally reshape your data to make the diff smaller. I work on a search app that thrashed for 1.2s every time new search results came in. The problem was that the results were invalidating a recursive menu component which was re-rendering 4 times per update. Avoiding the invalidation fixed the specific delay but the menu was still slow. Switching the menu&#x27;s data organization from at tree of objects with `open` attrs to a static tree + open path and only rendering the visible nodes solved the perf problems in the app.",1446552921

(E.g. the writer really knows how to set up an email server from scratch and has done so since 1993.)  In this case, the writer has isolated a particular component as &quot;free&quot; and then worked his thinking outward from that.  The &quot;free-ness&quot; he&#x27;s fixated on has distorted the thinking and is causing <i>all other costs to be ignored</i>.<p><pre><code>  - The Unix sendmail,postmail,etc programs are free.\n  - Mozilla Thunderbird, Roundcube, etc are free.\n  - SMTP specification has no license costs and is free.\n  - They are all free in both meanings as in libre (&quot;free speech&quot;) and cost (&quot;free beer&quot;).\n</code></pre>\nHowever,<p><pre><code>  - Trust is not free.\n  - Reputation is not free.\n  - Diskspace is not free.\n  - Bandwidth is not free.\n  - Time and attention for eyeballs to look at unwanted email is not free.\n  - all the above contribute to umbrella effort of &quot;fighting spam&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nTo understand why thinking outward from the phrase &quot;softare freedom&quot; is a flawed framework, replace it with &quot;English Language freedom&quot;.<p>We can all use the ~200,000 words[1] of the English Language without paying EnglishSoft Inc a monthly subscription fee.<p>Despite my EnglishLanguage freedom, it is being blocked by other agents and gatekeepers.  I should have the freedom to communicate my English to anybody including actors, rich people, and high ranking officials.<p>For example, all the following middlemen are trampling on my freedom:<p><pre><code>  - The agents for Tom Cruise and Jennifer Aniston who screen everyone&#x27;s calls.  \n  - The secretary who blocks my communication with Warren Buffett.\n  - The White House Chief of Staff and other gatekeepers to the President.\n</code></pre>\nIn another related example, we have the global phone network.  In some sense, we collectively have a &quot;phone dialing freedom&quot;.  \nHowever, I wish there were big companies that I could pay to screen <i>every call</i> on my behalf.  Many people would <i>want</i> them to keep centralized blacklists on annoying telemarketers, political pollsters, etc. For example, I&#x27;d prefer Verizon/AT&T maintained the blacklists instead of me keeping adhoc blocklists on my iPhone for every unwanted call.  I don&#x27;t want my phone to ring at all for such calls.  I also don&#x27;t want  a spam voicemail that I have to later delete.   If I use such a service, did I trample on your &quot;phone dialing freedom&quot;?  I certainly did!  I think many of us would like the &quot;freedom&quot; to do that!<p>Therefore, focusing on &quot;English Language freedom&quot;, &quot;phone dialing freedom&quot;, or &quot;software freedom&quot; will make one blind to the bigger picture of why blocking&filtering manifests itself as an <i>emergent property</i> of any communications network.  The fact that it&#x27;s also crazy hard to communicate credibility to get off those blacklists and honest people like the author suffered is unavoidable.  Otherwise, spammers could <i>also</i> trivially remove themselves from blacklists.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/how-many-words-ar...</a>",1446552278

10498976,comment,10494831,10498709,0,0,alevskaya,,,"Reverse engineering binary or obfuscated code does take long chunks of unbroken time and a lot of attention.  You have to fill up your short term memory with many structures seen or guessed at in order to begin making connections between them.  Making diagrams can help, but mostly it’s reasoning through things step by step while jumping around the code and learning to recognize patterns.  Sometimes little scripts can be useful for globally altering the code or testing an idea.<p>In the guess of a cpu emulator, it’s actually much simpler, there’s extremely comprehensive documentation on how the 386 is supposed to behave.  In this case I simply had to recognize the clever tricks used to emulate such behavior efficiently in software, e.g. using XOR operations to efficiently simulate the behavior of the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).  It was mostly just reformatting, documenting and renaming things intelligently.<p>I have to confess that I find it all therapeutic in a way.  Normally I read papers and do experiments and attempt to design things in biology, where nothing is clear at all, ever.  We have the genome, which looks simple, but no way to simulate anything usefully (microscopic physics is hard and traverses a vast temporal hierarchy in “running” a cell).  We’re left with uncertain measurements of the behavior of enzymes and molecules to guess at what’s going on inside the stochastic, dynamic maelstrom of a cell.  It’s still reverse engineering, but it’s so much slower to do on an alien, practically uncomputable architecture than in a synthetic universe made by human minds to be understandable by human minds.",1446552087

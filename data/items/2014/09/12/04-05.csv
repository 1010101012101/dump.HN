But engineering has gotten very lucrative due to the IT boom, overall growth in economy and general demand for engineers in a high growth environment.<p>Also engineering has a lower barrier to entry and pays better than what many physicians make these days. To make anything decent as a doctor you have to do your MD, which is expensive both in terms of investment of time and money. And even after that, the job at the hospital won&#x27;t pay you anything close to what your average engineer at a MNC would get paid.<p>And then don&#x27;t forget the fact that many engineers can make money through side projects, freelancing and take adhoc risks like doing start ups which isn&#x27;t even an option to most doctors.",1410497962

8306639,comment,8304019,8304561,1,0,kamaal,,,"Nice to hear that you had a good experience here in India. But don&#x27;t get too excited yet.<p>Medical industry is only lucrative to foreigners coming to India because of the foreign exchange factor. Otherwise its the same this there too. Not the kind of Insurance company mess I hear happening in the US through folks on this forum, but there similar things here too.<p>To start with most doctors will write down a series of tests even if they are dead sure of what the problem is. These even include stuff like viral fever, common cold. People fall for it because dengue and typhoid has been always been for a while here. We have a famous test called &#x27;basin test&#x27;- basically it means collecting the patients blood and draining it in the basin, because every one is so sure that the patient has no issues there is hardly any point wasting time and resources testing.<p>Doctors purposefully prolonging treatments to keep the consultation fees coming is pretty common. Most physicians close to your home, where you would generally go have a deal with a the nearest pharmacy for commissions in exchange for writing down drugs which are only available in the pharmacy. Same works for writing down tests. Although these days &#x27;polyclinics&#x27; are getting pretty common, the doctor will generally have a small test lab at the clinic and will to makes some money through that too. I even know doctors who run diabetic camps, thyroid camps and obesity camps and what not just to get patients to clinics because drug companies want some free marketing and trap more patients to believe they have some disease which they don&#x27;t.<p>Medical education is expensive in India. Sure you will get respect but even for an ordinary Indian, overall tuition and capitation fees means the only way for them to recover their investment is through either cheating or dowry.<p>The bigger problems like are a little different, but even there mishandling of cases and purpose full wrong treatment to pump up the hospital bills is pretty common.<p>Its the same everywhere. Its about greed, people in US and India are no different. Greed works the same way in US the way it works in India.",1410497465

On a slow portable 2.5&quot; 25MB/sec USB2 connection it&#x27;s never taken me more than 1hr on completely cold caches to verify that no file needs to be copied. With caches being hot, it&#x27;s a few minutes. And on faster drives it&#x27;s faster still.<p>Unless you are doing something weird and force it to checksum, checksumming mostly kicks in on files that have actually changed <i>and</i> can be transferred efficiently in parts (i.e. network; NOT on local disks). In other cases, it&#x27;s just a straight copy.<p>Have you actually used rsync in the setting you describe, or at least read its manual?",1410497362

8306634,comment,8302303,8305231,4,0,ryao,,,"I am working on tearing down barriers to this. Expect to see the fruit of that effort later this year.<p>That said, I do not consider absence from Linus&#x27; tree to be a barrier because being in Linus&#x27; tree limits the ability of end users to obtain bug fixes. That is a problem other filesystems have that I am happy to see ZFSOnLinux avoid.<p>Also, Linus Torvalds and I discussed the possibility of merging ZFS into his tree because of feedback like yours. In short, Linus has no interest in merging ZFS into his tree. Linus thinks that it might enable Oracle might sue people unless they provide a signed-off to confirm that the code is under the CDDL. He also thinks that the kernel signed off keeps Oracle from suing people over btrfs when software patents are a likely loophole.<p>Lastly, I realize that my statement about the signed off confirming that the code is under the CDDL might sound strange. However, there are two cases to consider. The first case involves source code. The GPL does not restrict the redistribution of source code, so there would be no problem. The second case is binaries, which the GPL does restrict in situations in which a court of law would consider to be a derived work. Being a module only option should be sufficient to deal with that. Linus did not seem to have any problem with that idea. However, he insists on Oracle&#x27;s signed off with the preference that it be Larry Elison.",1410497345

8306630,comment,8306611,8306611,3,0,ggchappell,,,"Yes, that idea does allow for measurement of distances to astronomical objects. Sadly, to get decent measurements for things like stars, the two telescopes need to be <i>very</i> far apart -- farther apart than the diameter of the earth. But we can be clever about it; if we take a picture of a star and then take another one 6 months later, then the distance between the two positions we took pictures from is the diameter of the earth&#x27;s orbit around the sun -- around 300 million km (while the diameter of the earth is less than 13 thousand km).<p>That allows measurement of the distance to nearby stars. For most stars, though, even 300 million km isn&#x27;t far enough.<p>From Wikipedia[1]:<p>> Astronomers use the principle of parallax to measure distances to the closer stars. Here, the term &quot;parallax&quot; is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star, as observed when the Earth is on opposite sides of the sun in its orbit. These distances form the lowest rung of what is called &quot;the cosmic distance ladder&quot;, the first in a succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax</a>",1410497277

8306618,comment,8302303,8304144,3,0,ryao,,,"That is not a requirement. ZoL has the most sophisticated build system of any Linux kernel module in the world to enable it to live outside of the main tree. ZoL relies on autotools&#x27; API checks to do this. In addition, the project has an automated buildbot that helps us to detect regressions in pull requests before they are merged. It is similar in principle to how lustre filesystem development is done. Lustre is also (primarily) outside of the tree and lived entirely outside of the tree for years.<p>That being said, being inside the kernel source tree is not necessarily a good thing. As I wrote in the blog post, other filesystems on Linux generally do not provide the latest code to older kernels, but ZoL provides the latest code to all supported kernels and distributions. This ranges from Linux 2.6.26.y to the 3.16.y in 0.6.3 and will include 3.17.y in 0.6.4. Something as important as a filesystem should be updated to fix bugs, even if the kernel proper cannot be. The inability of all Linux systems to update to the latest kernel is an issue that Linus Torvalds mentioned at LinuxCon North America 2014 and ZoL is one of the few filesystems that can deal with it on systems where it is deployed.",1410496760

The result of both is identical: The ISPs won&#x27;t be permitted to charge fees.<p>Look at it in a different context. Because of a technicality in the wording of a statute, all existing traffic laws are found unconstitutional. The legislature introduces a bill that reinstates most of the traffic laws in a way which is constitutional but the bill doesn&#x27;t reinstate the prohibition against driving while intoxicated. Are you really claiming that someone who points out that the bill &quot;allows driving drunk&quot; is incorrect?

If I&#x27;m a company that doesn&#x27;t pay the fee, will I get the same service I did before, or will I be slowed down/cut off?<p>In the presence of sufficient capacity no packets are dropped and there is no fast lane or slow lane. The only way to have a fast lane is to have insufficient capacity and then allocate the existing capacity in preference to the fast lane at the expense of the slow lane.

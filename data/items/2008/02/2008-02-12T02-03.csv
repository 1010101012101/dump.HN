113771,comment,113473,113473,0,0,tx,,,"I refuse to believe in memcached. Apache, along with other web servers, has a built-in in-memory cache for static content. Decent SQL-servers have <i>several</i> caches on different levels, in fact those caches in theory should be far more effective than a simple remote hashtable that memcached is. And all that - on top of OS level disk I/O caching.<p>I suspect that memcached was born as a result of sloppy SQL querying multiplied by inefficient SQL schema and lack of RDBMS tuning skills. Moreover, anyone can have memcached with zero programming by either hosting DB on a RAM disk with replication, or using in-memory tables.",1202784614

I use Litespeed (<a href=""http://www.litespeedtech.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.litespeedtech.com/</a>) for the web server. It is excellent for Ruby on Rails hosting. It dynamically manages Ruby processes - if there is no traffic it shuts down the processes, if there is traffic it ramps up the number as necessary up to the max that you specify.<p>On my slice I have a few PHP sites, a few static sites and 4 RoR sites (most of which get very little traffic.) Overall about 30k page views a day.<p>Litespeed isn't open source, but it is free and it works great for my hosting.",1202783464

One of the office evangelists became a Xobni user through our in-app invite system.  He liked the product.  He reached out to us and then we spent a couple weeks putting together screenshots, and answering questions.

The site isn't hackernews.com, it's news.yc. That comes with certain connotations.<p>One of which is that the site gets free publicity and name recognition. Another is that people are on their ""best"" behavior, since their comments might be counted as part of their YC app.<p>The downside is that people are going to associate anything that goes on with the core YC project.",1202782821

113754,comment,113531,113645,0,0,xirium,,,"I've seen one of these websites in the media. It must be a PR hit because there is nothing new about storing recipes on a computer. It was a common vision of the future since the 1970s to have a computer in the kitchen which would retreive recipes. The Commodore VIC20 manual, circa 1982, had an example recipe program.<p>Also, this something that search engines could do for 10 years. I worked in a Internet cafe and I explained to a old woman that a search engine allowed you to search by content. She reponded ""Does that mean if I search for a list of ingredients, I get a recipe?""<p>This was an absolutely geniusly insightful response. Indeed, I distinctly remember trying this technique with AltaVista at least 10 years ago. Of course, then, the number of webpages was sparse compared to nowadays. So, AltaVista allowed partial matches. Nowadays, you'd only get an exact match.",1202782127

This theory became dogma, despite abundant evidence that red, yellow, and blue primaries cannot mix all other colors, and has survived in color theory to the present day.[16]<p>Using red, yellow, and blue as primaries yields a relatively small gamut, in which, among other problems, colorful greens, cyans, and magentas are impossible to mix, because red, yellow, and blue are not well-spaced around a perceptually uniform color wheel.""",1202781860

Prices are therefore pegged to local currencies, and if you want to keep that then it&#x27;s no longer low cost because conversion to/from local currency costs just as much. The speculation and (eventually) deflationary nature of BTC significantly hinders the chances of it ever stabilising, and therefore a true &#x27;bitcoin economy&#x27; emerging (ie. where people do not need to peg to or convert to local currencies).<p>Then there is the fact that it is not a limited good-- someone could quite easily come along with a BetterCoin making BTC almost useless-- there are various things that could be improved, eg privacy, or the slow confirmation times.<p>E: also, there will be an &#x27;oversupply&#x27;-- Whoever buys these bitcoins won&#x27;t be buying other BTC because of it -- it&#x27;s irrational to think that the auction is creating a significant new demand that wouldn&#x27;t have existed otherwise! Selling over weeks/months would still affect the price, although more in the normal supply/demand manner than causing a crash/panic. But that could be happening before any of these BTC are sold anyway!",1402613988

IIRC, the documentation says that `needs` only applies to singleton controllers. If you have a controller associated with a model (vs. a view + controller + route combo), I would assume that it&#x27;s not a singleton (i.e. controllers associated with a view are singletons in that Controller.init() is only called once, even when switching away and back to a view).",1402613981

7886510,comment,7884815,7884815,1,0,kinow,,,"Interesting post, I want to take a look at GoCD to see if there are things to be migrated to existing plug-ins in Jenkins.<p>Though I like and follow some brilliant minds in ThoughtWorks, I think they took too long to Open Source Go. With +900 plug-ins, supportive community and being used in different fields (I use Jenkins in bioinformatics and for software development, but there are people using in robotics, testing medical devices) I don&#x27;t see why I would use GoCD.<p>> Jenkins pipelines are somewhat simplistic and comparing the respective visualizations is in fact misleading (Jenkins top, GoCD bottom):<p>The diagram displayed in the post is misleading. That is the view created by the pipeline plug-in. While this plug-in works great, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t play well with other plug-ins (e.g.: build flow [1]). My bioinformatics pipeline has several build steps (tasks in GoCD?) that invoke several different tools.<p>Each build step is usually provided by a different plug-in. And some jobs run in parallel too (with the Build Flow Plug-in). There are parts of the pipeline that run in a batch server (PBS Torque server) using a plug-in built by our team. Build flow provides a different pipeline view [2], but it is quite easy to create another plug-in to display pipelines in a different way.<p>Maybe this same pipeline could be created with GoCD, but at the time it was created (2010) we had to use Open Source tools for this. So I find it easier to port features from GoCD to Jenkins, rather than re-create plug-ins to use the pipeline feature in GoCD.<p>[1] <a href=""https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14302"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14302</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/download/attachments/66847200/Capture+d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran+2013-08-08+%C3%A0+18.54.39.png?version=1&modificationDate=1375980909000"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/download/attachments/66847200/Ca...</a>",1402613954

7886500,comment,7885173,7886406,5,0,PeterisP,,,"Actually, when talking about possibilities for election fraud in contested places, threats seem much more common and plausible than simple votes-for-cash trade. It&#x27;s more widespread in places with less democratic traditions, but USA history has also a fair share of examples.<p>The most common current method worldwide for &quot;vote buying&quot; seems to be done by large regional employers organizing voting as such for their employees (time schedules, transportation, lunch/party after voting), sometimes that can be very effective as strategic voting (i.e., bussing large numbers of voters to a different district). If the votes would be actually verifiable, then even without any illegal violence it&#x27;d simply mean near-permanent unemployment in that town for &quot;wrong-party&quot; people.<p>And that&#x27;s about ordinary elections. For a different example, the recent referendum for Crimea joining Russia, according to their official results, had ~32000 people voting against. I&#x27;m not informed about what&#x27;s happening in Crimea now, but I&#x27;m very sure that if I was one of them, I wouldn&#x27;t want that vote to be verifiable - the hypothetical risks far outweigh any possible benefits.",1402613857

Thus their will be an oversupply in the market and cause the price to decrease.  Expecting this, people are taking that into account and trying to get out before the oversupply, causing a self fulfilling prophecy based on bad underlying analysis.<p>Why would someone go long bitcoins (i.e. buy them and in such quantity) through such a difficult process as dealing with the US gov&#x27;t to so quickly exit their position?<p>My hypothesis is that it will be either rich institutional investors, hedge funds, or similar large investors who see this as an opportunity to acquire bitcoins at an undermarket price.<p>I think many of those groups would sit on their position (and not sell them).  Further, if they were to sell them, they would want to do so in a way that didn&#x27;t dramatically affect the price (thus over many days, weeks, or months).  Given that 30K bitcoins is far less than the total bought/sold on exchanges every day, it should be presumed that they can exit this position over a sufficient timeline in order to not cause negative pressure on the price (if the auction winners even want to sell -- which as I analyzed above, I don&#x27;t think they would).",1402613023

FreeBSD has its merits, and I think it&#x27;s a cool project, but the popularity of its derivations has nothing to do with its quality.<p>I can understand the legal-freedom angle of non-copyleft.

When I want to release a body of code as free software, but not have that code be used to develop nonfree software (nor DRM, nor patent abuse, ...), legal complexity has to come into the picture.<p>The MIT and BSD licenses are really simple, and I get that appeal. I long for an AGPL-like license that doesn&#x27;t run over 600 lines. Thankfully, the GNU project has a lot of documentation of its licenses, so the most common questions are already answered.<p>I think the GPL licenses are only problems for people (or employees) who - implicitly or explicitly - are trying to avoid contributing to free software.

7886430,comment,7886192,7886192,4,0,srean,,,"Places where this bites you is using numerical optimization algorithms in Python/Numpy, particularly when using gradient based methods. They make a HUGE boat load of calls to evaluate the objective function value and objective function gradient.  Typically both are callback functions. Worse they do it in a very tight and CPU bound loop.<p>This is one place where the much repeated &quot;write your most expensive part in C or Fortran&quot; does not give enough benefit unless you encapsulate the entire thing in C. Here I have assumed that the objective function and the gradient function has been exposed to Python&#x27;s runtime through a C module.<p>Although the time spent evaluating the function and evaluating the gradient can be reduced hugely by switching to C explicitly, or implicitly by using Numpy vectorized expressions, there is still this large overhead of making that many calls to a Python function. Same issue with JNI.<p>Cython helps some here by encapsulating the entire thing in C, however if you have to call out to Python&#x27;s or Numpy&#x27;s C-API you are back to square one. This is important because if you want to write readable Cython (meaning something that looks like Numpy) that is free of low low level loops, it is very hard to avoid those API calls.<p>I would assume that a JIT with a good inliner would help a lot here.<p>In fact C itself does not fair well for this use case. This is one place where, ... wait for it.... a smart enough compiler for a high level language like Lisp can give a lot of speedup, example Stalin, and Stalingrad. You can do a lot with C++ and D&#x27;s compile time metaprogramming machinery. C++  metaprogramming is quite painful if you are rolling your own. It was never designed for this use case. D is great but code-generation part of their toolchain arent that mature yet. Although it can be as fast as C++, one often has to desugar manually. Hopefully it will get better at it soon.<p>Fortran is also supposed to beat C routinely here, but I am not quite sure why/how it does it. If you know why it turns out to be faster I would be eager to know. I think Fortran semantics restricts possible data dependency paths enough that the compiler can (a) do a lot of SIMD vectorization and (b) avoid reloading data from memory and work with cached values. I dont know whether Fortran semantics helps in inlining away function calls.",1402612882

It is more a report of a design tradeoff: the authors of those CP systems completely understand what happens, but were not happy to pay this performance price for reads. One thing is to have a data store that has a very limited performance in write operations but is very fast when you need to read, another thing is a data store where both writes and reads are very slow. However once you read potentially stale data from nodes, many of the advantages of having a CP system are gone.

Because, er, the market will select companies that protect freedom, right?<p>An MIT/BSD/Apache project means: people can take it, extend it, incorporate it into their totally non-free product, and they <i>may</i> contribute back to the original project <i>when it suits them</i>.<p>An AGPL project means: people can take it, extend it, use it for whatever they want privately, but, if conveying it publicly, the covered work must have the freedoms required by the AGPL.<p>Your argument is basically that many companies prefer non-copyleft, and this means that non-copyleft projects will have a larger contributor pool (from their employees). Thus, non-copyleft projects will be better off than copyleft projects.<p>There are a number of issues with that argument.<p>First, just as there are people who prefer to contribute to non-copyleft projects because it means they can use it to develop nonfree software, there are people who prefer to contribute to copyleft projects because they don&#x27;t want to contribute to nonfree software. Unless you have reliable data on the exact numbers of people who like or dislike copyleft, you can&#x27;t make the claim that &quot;more people will participate in a non-copyleft project&quot;. There very well could be more individual developers who prefer to contribute to copyleft projects, than there are employees that companies will pay to contribute to non-copyleft projects.<p>Second, whereas it&#x27;s a choice to release your extensions of a non-copyleft project, it&#x27;s a requirement of using copylefted projects. Thus, a copyleft project can be assured that all copyleft-friendly developers will give back to it if they extend it, whereas a non-copyleft project has no such assurance. I believe that this is a large reason why Linux has thrived and persevered over the past two decades; Linus Torvalds agrees. [0]<p>Third, and most importantly, <i>free software shouldn&#x27;t be about practicality</i>. Copyleft is about protecting free software, and thus the freedom of a society dependent on software, by enabling free software development, and not contributing to the development of nonfree software. Google, Apple, Facebook, startup bubblers all hate copyleft - what a surprise! They can&#x27;t use my code in nonfree software without paying me for a proprietary license; boo hoo. Free software licensing should never be about companies&#x27; convenience, winning popularity contests, or other vacuous exercises. Free software licensing should should be about protecting the freedoms of the software - for all users now and future.<p>Look, there are cases of copylefted projects succeeding and non-copylefted projects succeeding. If someone wants to write and release non-copylefted code, I&#x27;m still thankful for that because the code itself will stay free forever more. However, when someone releases code under a non-copyleft license, they are making our future just as comfy for nonfree software as it would be for free software, and that&#x27;s certainly not ideal. I want nonfree software developers to have as hard a time as possible, because I think nonfree software is harmful.

But remember, that&#x27;s my point: you won&#x27;t ever know why the price rises or falls.

Someone out there willing to give you X dollars for Y bitcoins. (Consider the concept of X dollars for Y barrels of gas, or Z oz of gold).<p>Money is used multiple times. The dollar you spend at the store is then split up and spent again, and again, and again. So the value of the whole currency is what is important, how much buying power the currency you have is based on how many dollars there are, what they can be spent for, how often they are spent, etc. By offering X dollars for Y bitcoins, what people really mean is: offering x% of all the dollars for y% of all the bitcoins.<p>This sale adds more bitcoins (because portions of the markets believed them unrecoverable, and they haven&#x27;t been in circulation for a while), so Y bitcoins is now a smaller percentage of the whole buying power available for bitcoins, which means they are also worth less dollars. Similar effects are seen in fiat currency (like dollars) when more money is printed, it affects the money supply, and allows the government a modicum of control on inflation (when used correctly) but also can let the government to let inflation get out of control (re: most cases of Hyperinflation[1]).<p>The simpler explanation is simply: Because the supply of bitcoins went up, with a constant demand of bitcoins, the value goes down because more people are trying to sell them, and the price goes down due to competition etc (e.g. basic supply and demand).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation</a>",1402611431

In ANSI C on whatever processor he used, you can make over a billion function calls per second.  Even in Python, you can do about 2 million.<p>Take a look at a profile of your program sometime.  The vast majority of your functions get called maybe 20 times or less, with many of them being called only once (at startup) or once per operation (eg. setting up a request).  Then there are obvious hot spots, eg. in many profiles I&#x27;ve run malloc() is by far the biggest single offender.<p>The Python strategy is to use Python as a scripting & glue language, and drop down into C for the critical parts of your program.   You can get really far just writing initialization code in Python, keeping your data structures in C, and writing the inner loop of your algorithm or the critical part of your request processing in C.",1402610585

7886254,comment,7874699,7885514,1,0,opendais,,,"> If you want vouchers, you need to fund every child equally...including the fact they may live in the wrong neighborhood. You don&#x27;t get to say &quot;Too bad, kid, you live in Compton. No one can get you to a good school on time unless we gave you more than every other kid.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if your didn&#x27;t understand that bit or what the issue is. I&#x27;m fine with vouchers as long as they actually <i>cover what is currently provided</i>.<p>And you are assuming they all live in major cities [hint: 20% of the population is rural/small town america].<p>Look, your plan requires:\n1) Preventing poor kids from eating lunch [because they have no money]\n2) Preventing poor kids from having sufficient transportation to get to school in all areas of this country, not just major cities.\n2b) You want kids to walk unescorted in terrible, unsafe [your words, not mine] neighborhoods to make it to &quot;better schools&quot;.<p>In reality, my objection is the fact you won&#x27;t pay for the above which you conveniently and consistently ignore. Instead, you claim you are trying to &quot;help them&quot; while simultaneously starving them and increasing the economic burden on their family to get all students to a good school.<p>The reality is you cannot magically cut spending and rely on the free market to fix things. If you want services to remain roughly the same, you have to spend roughly the same amount of money regardless of if it is the government spending it in the form of public education or vouchers.<p>Personally, I think vouchers <i>that provide the same level of service as currently exists in an apples-to-apples way</i> is perfectly fine. The problem is, people like you pretend these services are somehow a complete waste of money servicing an imaginary need. They aren&#x27;t an imaginary need.<p>I know poor people who live in a rural area that literally <i>have to cross a lake that is more than a mile across</i> to get to a <i>school that teaches K-12 because it is the only school in the area for about 50 miles in any direction</i>.

7886249,comment,7877147,7883686,1,0,zbowling,,,"Javascript is inherently single threaded. It goes back to it&#x27;s roots. It would extremely difficult to make it multithreaded. Apps developed in Javascript are heavily asynchronous and avoid blocking for too long because of this limitation. In some ways this is good.<p>In the right situation, for example in node.js, this discourages anyone from doing anything that would block the single thread handling requests for very long and makes it easier to handle the C10K problem in a much more interesting way (where traditional servers create a thread per request or queue them to handle one by one from a pool, where node does it all from a single thread). In other ways this can be bad it causes (in the case of Node developers) developers to not do a lot of the heavy lifting in Javascript itself and to hand off to native code that can do long hard things that may block on real threads (database queries, persistence backends, file IO).<p>The thing is that some code is easier to write with threads in mind. If I know there are 4 processes on a system, I can make 4 threads and use effectively use all for processors (potentially) at the same time. This is not really possible with Javascript. This makes heavy apps on a device like the Firefox phone (which is all about Javascript only) that want to could really benefit from using multiple cores impossible to take advantage of them (unless the user uses webworkers).<p>There are also just an epic amount of legacy with apps that are inherently built around the concepts provided by threads. Javascript is basically becoming the bytecode of the web. Things like ASM.js and emscripten are pushing it this way. But it&#x27;s not really easy to port all code and fit on a model where threads are not allowed.<p>Conceptually web workers are more like processes than threads. It&#x27;s a shitty work around in Javascript since we can&#x27;t easily have threads without breaking the way Javascript works (which would break the web potentially). That means we have to write code into different processes where everything is isolated. On top of that, you can&#x27;t share memory and you have to message and marshal data between webworkers. This is awkward and impossible to target from something like emscripten making it near impossible to port something expecting threads exist (theoretically if you have a C app that didn&#x27;t use threads but different processes, you fit better but this almost never heard of). Most operating systems provide threads (pthreads most often except on Windows).<p>My solution is to make a scheduler that is used by my fork of emscpriten. All functions use return on call semantics and a &quot;scheduler&quot; in Javascript will decide which function should be called next from a list of virtual thread &quot;stacks&quot; (arrays) or if it should yield to the browser (setTimeout). The &quot;scheduler&quot; is single threaded itself so it&#x27;s not really &quot;threads&quot; but does make it possible to emulate them for porting from native code.",1402610449

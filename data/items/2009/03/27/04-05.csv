534726,comment,534521,534606,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"I think it's not about the affordability of the OS, it's about the affordability of the whole machine. In choosing a business strategy that allowed any OEM to load their OS on any HW, MS has ended up being on much cheaper machines (because of the competition in the HW market), and on machines that are less reliable and easy to use, partly due to that very openness (sure, not all Windows' faults are the consequence of this choice). So far all the things that Windows isn't, and all the faults it has, it is still the cheapest way to buy a personal computer, so I think it makes sense to MS to talk about that.<p>The thing I find strange about this ad is that they are trying to associate with people who can't afford a Mac (quote: <i>my budget can't stretch..</i>). Surely those people will buy a Windows machine anyway? If you wanted to make a point about price, wouldn't you try to associate with the people who do have the cash for a Mac, but point out to them that if they get a Windows machine their <i>other $x000</i> can be spent on something else, e.g. a DSLR, holiday, etc. So maybe the real point of this ad is simply <i>feel good factor</i>, ala 'Windows is your friend'.",1238129938

Arguably, two very potent advertising concepts executed in a short and effective commercial.<p>The targeting of these 'i'm a pc' ads and this particular one is 'I'm a person, with dynamic requirements as to what I need in a computer, one of those happens to be a 17"" screen on an affordable laptop'.  Contrast this with the Apple ads.  There are people (read: average consumers) that see those ads and then walk into the Apple store (without knowledge of all the particulars that comprise the Mac experience) and think ""wow, these are really nice, but a bit out of my budget"".  They then go into Best Buy, see something in their price range, and settle on that.  I'd be willing to bet this happens everyday.  More often than not, these are satisfied customers who could really care less about owning a Mac because they didn't just pay $1799 extra for a similar (in their mind) machine.",1238129322

You're talking about being frustrated with stupid people: stop focussing on them. Avoid toxic people and spaces - cultivate your selfish world.

534682,comment,533864,534339,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"First of all, I think your thesis is an example of ""agent bias"". Humans have a tendency to scapegoat, to blame <i>someone</i> for events rather than impersonal forces.<p>Based on what I have read about monetary crises, financial panics, and recessions (past and present), I find it hard to accept the thesis that if we only had fewer ""douchebags"" in the world, that we could avoid all problems. Financial flows would still induce bubbles, and bubbles would still play on mob psychology. Devaluing a currency would still push GDP above its natural level, and require a period of readjustment.<p>Furthermore, the corporate culture of the 2000s and the 1990s was far, far, far more professional and less ""douchebaggy"" than what I've heard of the 80s. Why, you can get fired for sexual harassment nowadays, which would have been impossible 20 years ago.<p>Again the system you describe where ""douchebags"" rule is far different from my experience in the system. You say that non-""douchebags"" cannot climb the corporate hierarchy because it is stacked with ""douchebags"". Your crude term does not describe the majority of the MBAs, CEOs, MDs, associates, CFOs, accountants, lawyers, and others that I had the pleasure to be acquainted with, although there was a minority of people that I certainly would not like to ever see again.<p>Lastly, I suspect you are getting upvotes merely for using rhetoric that makes teenagers giggle, which I find sad. Such a juvenile word choice lowers your credibility, because it appeals to the inner snickering child, and not the logical mind.

It's nice to find that it's not at all difficult to find people online who share my views on religion.<p>Yet, I still do have good relationships with friends and family despite differences on religion and other subjects - and I think the key to this is focusing on the common ground we can share and enjoy together instead of on the differences.  After all, we're all human beings with different emotional biases and flaws, even those of us who consider ourselves among the more rational.  And love and enjoyment of art and music and nature and sex and humor, etc. - all of that is emotional rather than rational.

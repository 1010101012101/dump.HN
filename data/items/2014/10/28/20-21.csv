Many times \nthat person is the Blowhard, but too many times that person \nor entity is the boss,wealthy parent,  or teacher.  When I was in school, I was surprised how few students would correct the teacher.\nI understood they were concerned about grades, but there&#x27;s \na point where I literally wanted to strangle a teacher, or \nboss. I came close, and my grades suffered.  As to bosses, I \nwould quit, or hurt them &quot;the old faschioned way&quot;.  Right now, my biggest gripe with people who &quot;just go \nalong with&quot; is our current treatment of the Homeless.

Driverless cars will. A world with driverless cars could follow two models. Let&#x27;s call them Apple and IBM.<p>Apple: each household owns a driverless car. Perhaps it can be occasionally rideshared via UberX, Lyft, etc. In this world, you are right: Uber tomorrow will be Uber today.<p>IBM: Uber (or Google or Tesla...) owns (and finances and repairs and replenishes) a fleet of driverless cars. Households pay it use fees. In this world, Uber&#x27;s strategic autonomy is dramatically improved over today. If I were Uber, this is the long game I&#x27;d be playing for. I would be (a) training riders to depend on hiring cars with minimal personal contact, (b) encouraging the development of driverless cars, and (c) building a cash pile for rapidly acquiring a vast fleet of driverless cars the moment they become viable.",1414529750

8523528,comment,8515370,8521889,0,0,tedks,,,">It was my understanding that most harassment and abuse is about dominance of the mind rather than physical. It&#x27;s not about exercising entitlement, it&#x27;s about establishing ownership. Subtle, but different.<p>Well, yes, abuse is about power and control, certainly. But an abuser exerts power and control in a variety of ways and for a variety of reasons. The root cause of street harassment is certainly for men to exercise power and control over not just a specific woman, but over the class of women as a whole; however, a factor that enables this is the narrative that men are entitled to women and women&#x27;s bodies. This is why there are &quot;nice guys&quot; -- because men are taught that women are vending machines, fed tokens of chivalry and dispensing sex as a result. I wouldn&#x27;t call the abusive pattern of &quot;nice guys&quot; about specifically women&#x27;s minds vs. bodies, but rather that &quot;nice guys&quot; seek to exert dominance, power, and control over women by punishing women that do not behave according to the rules of the game that they set.<p>So, subtle, different, but not wholly distinct either. In a phrase, why do men feel entitled to own women&#x27;s bodies?<p>>Killing 4chan would be like dropping a brick on a piece of shit - you don&#x27;t have any less shit, just scattered.<p>But there&#x27;s a lot of value in scattering the shit:<p>* You immediately damage the command-and-control system, fragmenting it into many subforums that are less individually efficacious for at least a period of time before a spiritual successor emerges<p>* You send a message to everyone involved that what they are doing is not, in fact, okay. This is very important. Most 4channers/GamerGaters/men feel that it is <i>normal</i> to want the things they want and to do the things they do. Feminism is a dirty word and feminists are an aberration. Everyone imagines themselves the hero of their own story, but it&#x27;s hard to maintain that image if the world denounces you. Heroes are not often denounced by the world.<p>(Further, I personally care nothing for the implications to the platform. If you allow this filth on your platform you deserve what happens to you. You can&#x27;t hide behind the actions of users when this is what you&#x27;re actively profiting from -- the vast majority of 4chan ads are violently misogynist Japanese sex toys.)",1414529679

History showed that that did not happen for many businesses who used Groupon.<p>Similarly, so much of Uber&#x27;s marketing is targeted towards the supply side (i.e. drivers) and the promise of making more than they could at any other available job, with &quot;flexible hours&quot; and other dubious perks. This is just the latest article to show that that is not the case.<p>Groupon&#x27;s and Uber&#x27;s business both depend on acquiring and retaining the best local businesses and drivers respectively, and as these kinds of stories keep coming to light, I wonder whether Uber will be able to retain all the drivers they acquire. Lyft has focused from the start on making their drivers happy, which is a smart way to differentiate from Uber&#x27;s mercenary mindset, but I also wonder if that is enough to really differentiate itself in the eyes of drivers, at least enough to make Uber really worry.<p>In all honesty, I am rooting for someone to beat out Uber.

Domain knowledge and math skills are tested by your eduction. Motivation and leadership by committee work. Other skills by teaching. The only difference is your focus on proposals rather than results, and this is already the case in some fields.<p>I come for a &quot;search for physics beyond the standard model&quot; background, where other than the neutrino mass (from the SNO collaboration, which I was part of) there hasn&#x27;t been a positive result in decades. So there is already a good deal of focus on proposals rather than results, and yet almost all the issues I see in the biosciences (I jumped ship to genomics in the mid-00&#x27;s) are also present in that area of physics.<p>Ergo, empirically, I&#x27;m doubtful that focusing on proposals rather than results will make much difference.<p>The difficulty is that science never makes economic sense for an individual. I spent a decade of my life measuring zero to higher and higher precision, and I know people who have spent entire careers doing so: putting new limits on branching ratios to exotic (which sounds so much better than &quot;nonexistent&quot;) decays and so on. It was fun, although I took a year off in the middle to do some medical physics and imaging, which was even more fun because I actually got to measure phenomena that exist.<p>So when I read things about the paucity of &quot;breakthrough discoveries&quot; I think that mostly the low-hanging fruit have been picked and genomics turns out to be a whole lot harder and more of a slog than people expected, with a vast amount of uninteresting material to be waded through for the sake of a slow accumulation of knowledge that we are still a century away from putting to any very good use.<p>I don&#x27;t know what an economically rational model for reward in such an environment is, and it&#x27;s good that the article raises the issue and explores some alternative approaches, but I don&#x27;t think there is any easy fix for the problem because I don&#x27;t think science makes any economic sense.

Settlement free peering is free because the two sides transfer the same amount so it&#x27;s a net of roughly zero. In these cases, the net is heavily on the Cogent or L3 side.<p>Now I think there is a decent argument that ISPs should have to have free peering available at their local loop level. If congent wants to peer at the CO office of the local telecom, it should be able to do it.<p>The issue is that Verizon is not just a local ISP, it&#x27;s a nationwide T1 provider. It sells transit service. It should be allowed to charge for transit to it&#x27;s own local loop networks.<p>2) There are no enforced monopolies anymore, and haven&#x27;t been for a long time.

I live in New  York. There are many transportation options. Like my tendency to default to a &quot;top of my wallet&quot; credit card, I tend to fire up Uber first. Other options are considered if Uber disappoints. It seldom does; Uber remains at the top of my &quot;stack&quot;.

The technology is easy to copy, but the ecosystem is not: network effects.<p>Let&#x27;s now consider the effects of changing technology on consumer behaviour. I can walk out of the aeroport in San Francisco, Paris, Austin or Abu Dhabi and have an Uber fueled and ready. Uber has been the driving factor behind me abandoning my driver&#x27;s license, and with it expectations of ever owning a car.<p>Here&#x27;s another technology: driverless cars. Driverless cars reduce fleet costs and risks, and increase scalability on the supply-side (i.e. scale is no longer limited by driver availability and quality).

The tradeoff there is that this means that customers who need something must <i>always</i> wait a certain amount of time before they can take care of their business.  That&#x27;s wasted time.

You pay with your time.<p>That 15 minutes waiting in line at the only open checkout register in a row of 20 point-of-sale terminals is a cost that you pay, that does not appear on your sales receipt.  The 30 minutes spent waiting on hold for a call center employee is a cost you pay, that does not appear on your billing statement.  The natural opponent to these incursions is the one entity that people created to ensure that costs and benefits for the individual could be subordinated to the collective cost and benefit to the whole--the government.  But being composed of individuals, it suffers from the same biases: severity is more important than frequency.<p>Nickel-and-diming is therefore a profitable strategy, and we will continue to see it, and be diminished as a result.

They get no permissions by default, but they can request, for example, network access and the user can then grant it once, per-session or always.<p>&quot;Untrusted 3rd party domain&quot; is the rest of us, and basically any app I ever installed, in which case the user is prevented from selecting &quot;always allow&quot; for network access and is prompted once per session, which was highly annoying.<p>So if anything, it was too secure! Sun sank their own standard by requiring expensive certificates for normal functionality. If they had used self-signed certificates they way Android does (checking on upgrade that it&#x27;s the same certificate) it would have been great.<p>&quot;Operator protection domain&quot; and &quot;Manufacturer protection domain&quot; mighty work differently, but that&#x27;s no different from the stuff that comes pre-installed on Android phones having access to everything without asking.",1414526643

8523229,comment,8520045,8523029,0,0,andreasvc,,,"This is not about memory allocation. OOM occurs when too much of the allocated memory is being <i>used</i>. For example, forking happens with copy-on-write memory, so if I have a 3G process on a 4G machine, I can fork it 10 times without problems. It&#x27;s only when those ten processes each start to write to their memory that the physical memory usage will quickly become too much to handle. In the scenario in the blog post, the OOM killer is disabled, and instead Linux can only prevent the memory from being accessed to avoid things getting worse. I would agree that this setup does sound like it needs fixing, but it&#x27;s what we got in exchange for having cheap process forks.",1414526613

I struck up a conversation with Larry Page, Google&#x27;s brilliant cofounder, who became the company&#x27;s CEO in 2011. “Larry, I still don&#x27;t get it. There are so many search companies. Web search, for free? Where does that get you?” My unimaginative blindness is solid evidence that predicting is hard, especially about the future, but in my defense this was before Google had ramped up its ad-auction scheme to generate real income, long before YouTube or any other major acquisitions. I was not the only avid user of its search site who thought it would not last long.<p>> But Page&#x27;s reply has always stuck with me: “Oh, we&#x27;re really making an AI.”",1414526515

What happened around age 20 when she decided to give up with the neurotypical way of vocalizing? An older brother or sister that never veers far from neurotypical would begin the influence on you with, for example: ""what? you don't have a cell phone? thats not normal!""",1204207126

It's great academically, <i>and</i> it seems to understand how to encourage students to get involved in startups.  In the startup world, it's Stanford and everyone else.<p>That said, ""everyone else"" still has some excellent options.  MIT, Harvard,... yeah, all good options.  But don't rule out the big public research universities.  Berkeley and Illinois grads (among many others) have produced a lot of great startups - great by almost any measure (except that damn university to the south ;) )",1204206780

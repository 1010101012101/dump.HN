I might be able to make vacation money though.<p>Also I should check to see if there's a difference in odds between betfair and intrade. Might be able to run some sort of cross-site arbitrage if possible.",1202320571
110370,comment,110035,110151,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"What does ""no predictive power"" mean? The Emperor's Nose technique has a certain amount of predictive power: it's very unlikely that it will be off by more than an inch, for example.<p>Similarly, in the hands of a conscious reader such as myself, my tarot deck has lots and lots of predictive power. Right now it tells me that Mike Gravel does not have a 50% chance to become President this year, that Barack Obama will not live to be 200 years old, and that Bill Clinton, with 99.999% certainty, has not invented a perpetual motion machine.<p>I'm not saying these markets are wrong. I'm suggesting that, at best, they're as correct as an off-the-cuff guess by the average reader of the New York Times. That's not all that impressive, but it's just good enough that I can't consistently outguess them without doing some research -- and, given that the total size of most of these penny-ante markets is less than a postdoc's annual salary, I'm never going to make any money doing that.",1202320370

I didn't mean to say Planck's right forever.<p>Phrased another way, I don't think his point in saying how science progresses by funerals is to point to his own death.  It was to highlight the misconception that most people have that current science theories come to prominence in science because the revolutionaries changed the minds of the old guard through proofs and experimentation.  Rather, proof and experimentation changed the minds of young revolutionaries, and only when old guards die off, the revolutionaries rise to take their place and make prominent the new theory.",1202320327

110365,story,,,7,11,mwmanning,"Ask YC: ""Why would I want to do that?""",,"I'm working with a friend on a chat application that we think is a unique approach to an idea that's been around for a few years but has never been implemented in a sensible way. When I tell people at work or at school about it, most of them get pretty excited, but I've noticed that I get quite a different reaction when I explain it to non-""tech-savvy"" people. Their response is either, ""I don't get it,"" or more frequently, ""Why would I want to do that?""<p>At first, I found this response rather disheartening, since as an entrepreneur, my top priority is to make something that people are going to want.  After some reflection, though, I think that this response is OK . . . at this early stage at least.  I think about applications like Facebook and Twitter, both of which are hugely popular presently, but would have sounded tedious and pointless to Joe Sixpack a year or two before they were launched.<p>I'm crossing my fingers, and hoping that when I have a workable demo to show non-tech people, they will ""get it"" and be as excited as my technologically inclined peers.   Is this leap of faith necessary, or am I being foolish in trying to sell people something that they may not readily understand?<p>Either way, I think my elevator pitch needs some work.",1202319734

The settings used are based on the results of SYN packet analysis by p0f. While the OS reported by other OS detection scanners were not identical to those of p0f, testing against Nmap, xprobe2, queso and cheops showed that they were unable to identify the correct operating system/version after Security Cloak settings had been applied.",1202317638

I would pour-your-heart into the application and if you do get the offer - write a hand-written letter (<i>no email</i>) and FedEx it to your internship contact. In the letter, tell your internship liason exactly what you told us - explain your feelings for why you regret turning them down (tell them how you feel, don't use logic). people buy on emotion and rationalize with logic (even the most logical people).

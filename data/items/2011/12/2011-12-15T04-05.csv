I'm sure one could train oneself to get a feel for the visualization better, sort of in the way that if you read music long enough you can sort of play a piece in your head and get a rough feel for the relations in the notes (not necessarily the correct pitches unless you have perfect pitch, but the correct relative pitches...if that makes sense - a musician could very well think in their head what a C-E-G sounds like, but not all would imagine a 440Hz tone for the C, perhaps one would think of a 500HZ, but the ratios between the notes in their imagined C-E-G and an actual C-E-G would be the same.",1323923361

I largely enjoyed my time, because it provides a (mostly) easy-to-deploy, fast-to-develop platform for web development. What it also provides is a maintenance nightmare. It promotes sloppy coding, and the library of standard functions are horribly inconsistent. Many people never run into this, but whe you really want to design something properly, using strong OO ideas, then PHP just isn't up to the task (type hinting is for objects only? what?).<p>Ruby I've never used personally, but it seems kinda popular. It doesn't have the market penetration for deployment of PHP or python, though.<p>Python is my new favourite for web development due to a couple of very nice frameworks. Django for when I want to build something fast, and don't care too much about controlling the particulars like user management, etc. Pyramid for when I want to develop something which will involve a lot of customising parts. They both have their strengths and weaknesses, and what you use is both personal preference, and should be decided based on the project.<p>Java - Oh, Java. GWT provides a nice way to build webapps with Java, but I'm not a fan of using it to build 'page' based web applications. That's personal preference, though, and I've got no good reasons not to use it - it just rubs me the wrong way for web.",1323922225

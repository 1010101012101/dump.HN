We do have time tracking exactly in the sense which you mentioned - while someone works on a task, or when he completes it - he gets a bubble asking &#x27;how long did it take you and what were you doing?&#x27; - then he just inputs the time taken and optionally a comment - and BAM! you can see the history of work in his profile.  Plus you can see the total time/cost of each project, plus estimated time of completion for each task and project.<p>We do have a kanban-like board where you can specify in what exact order an employee should work on tasks.<p>The reporting part is not fully fleshed out yet but we will work on it as soon as we launch.<p>Regarding CRM - it&#x27;s the first big item on our TODO list once we launch, and stabilise the system.  And it will base on our internal task/discussion engine so we won&#x27;t have that much work to do.<p>We share your opinion about the need to fully onboard users and collaborate with their existing tools.  Right now we are finishing up desktop file synchro, and mobile contacts/calendars synchro.  The stuff you mentioned will come next.  We have a really small but very talented team and it&#x27;s about time to launch at last after so many years - so we can&#x27;t have everything in version 1.  But we already have enough to interest people and it&#x27;s comprehensive enough to satisfy all their basic needs (except CRM :).<p>Please sign up on our beta site and please contact me directly via contact at dynado.com if you have any additional questions.  I will be very grateful for your ideas now and feedback once we launch.  If you are not worried about bugs and would like to look the product sooner than we launch - please let me know.",1390582526

There are a number of problems with their description that make it hard for me to evaluate. Having tried designing a memory-hard algorithm, I&#x27;d like to see what their key insight was, but there are a number of problems with their article. They use confusing operators, the wrong terms, and seemingly random constants.<p>How did they come up with the numbers 2, 3, 11, 2^21, and 2^22, for example? Is D the hash function or the underlying data? Or is &#x27;data&#x27; the underlying data? Does + mean addition or string concatenation? What about &quot;++&quot;? They never even use &quot;||&quot;, which they defined as string concatenation... Where does the nonce N come in? Is that actually supposed to be &#x27;n&#x27;? How do they justify that the optimal algorithm is the naive one? There is essentially no proof of this claim in the article.<p>In short, I&#x27;m very suspicious of their &quot;memory-hard&quot; algorithm. It took a fairly dense, multi-page whitepaper to explain Scrypt, and yet their &#x27;superior&#x27; version is just a couple of sloppy lines of pseudocode with no justification.<p>Here is what they wrote, for reference:<p>Let D be the underlying data (eg. in Bitcoin&#x27;s case the block header), N be the nonce and || be the string concatenation operator (ie. &#x27;foo&#x27; || &#x27;bar&#x27; == &#x27;foobar&#x27;) . The entire code for the algorithm is as follows:<p>0: D(data,xn,0) = sha3(data)<p>1: D(data,xn,n) =<p>2:     with v = sha3(data + xn + n)<p>3:          L = 2 if n < 2^21 else 11 if n < 2^22 else 3<p>4:          a[k] = floor(v/n^k) mod n for 0 <= k < 2<p>5:          a[k] = floor(v/n^k) mod 2^22 for 2 <= k < L<p>6:     sha3(v ++ D(data,xn,a[0]) ++ D(data,xn,a[1]) ++ ... ++ D(data,xn,a[L-1]))",1390582037

And we can perform experiments that verify this, and we can - more or less - perform those experiments while moving at speed (or we can find clever ways to test the theory using the motion of the Earth, as with Michaelson-Morely), and we observe that they still hold.<p>So then just think about objects moving at constant velocities, and how to reconcile their observations with each other - for simplicity, you probably want to start with 1D space. Plug the observations in, write some numbers, and special relativity more-or-less drops out as the only way things could possibly work. It really is a lot less confusing than it sounds.",1390581811

Because flask already supports a lot, the saved time would not be much for a long-term project.<p>Django or Flask matters only for small projects, such as one month long. The choice doesn&#x27;t matter for a large project. Yes, django template sucks, but you can change to mako or jinja or something else. You like django ORM?

The trouble is that coordinate change breaks the warrantee on the space-time continuum because it will stretch a plank length out to something macroscopic.  making quantum phenomena visible.<p>A simpler paradox which has never been taken seriously is that an outside observer sees that it takes forever for something falling into a black hole to hit the event horizon.  However,  knowing about Hawking radiation,  you know the black hole doesn&#x27;t last forever,  so an outside observer never sees anything fall into a black hole.<p>Thus the classical black hole was always a pipe dream.  In the 1970s the information paradox showed that a classical black hole (which makes information disappear because you can&#x27;t tell the difference between a black hole that was made out of gold bars or feathers) makes information disappear,  but information can&#x27;t disappear in a quantum mechanical universe.",1390581561

However even if I built a low-cost arcology in the middle of SF, I can guarantee that it would find a ready market of rich people willing to pay premium for it. Until the supply of real estate exceeds the demand of rich people willing to pay for it, the market will cater primarily to the wealthy and prices will remain high. A vasty liberalised zoning regime would probably help -- but not until it had saturated the market to the point where the wealthy were no longer crowding out the rest.<p>Unfortunately the financialisation of the real estate industry makes this very difficult to achieve, as the wealthy will keep acquiring real estate as an investment long after their need for it as an actual <i>place to live</i> has been sated.<p>Solutions to this will almost certainly need to include all of the following:<p>1.) Liberalisation of zoning & development, as you suggest (see Germany for a good example of this).<p>2.) Ending tax breaks which reward the accumulation of real estate. Probably other measures to de-financialise the real estate sector somewhat, such as requiring significantly higher reserves for banks.<p>3.)

The original ancestor of this thread was put off Owncloud by the fact it was PHP and Pydia was offered as an alternative. The name suggest at least to me that it would be Python based.<p>Now whether the PHP should put us off is a separate question. I have probably unfair doubts about the quality of things developed in PHP based worrying about the sort of people who would choose it when they have a free choice (see fractal of bad design post). However I personally don&#x27;t want to learn PHP so I would prefer something in Python, Rails or possibly even Node (I&#x27;ve a feeling that I&#x27;m going to need to learn Javascript one day), Java, C or C+++ so that the barrier to me tinkering/fixing is lower.",1390579534

Just opening a website in (up to date) Firefox literally opened .exe files on my PC and infected the entire OS. I burnt my hands once - not again. This might be an anecdote to you but boy that scarred me - the idea that clicking a link could compromise my entire system like that.<p>Even then - an antivirus program is unlikely to stop such an intrusion. It&#x27;s just utterly ineffective, and I got viruses before despite having an anti-virus. Also, my anti-virus always deleted my hacktools and own programs which was a nuisance. Hence I don&#x27;t use it anymore.",1442797119

Govt funded infrastructure projects are totally out of control, it&#x27;s not just NYC.<p>My favorite example is local, in Oregon. In 1982 a very fine bridge was opened across the Columbia River. It cost $170 million.[1] Fast forward to recently. Before the plug was finally pulled, estimated costs for a second bridge a few miles away were $2.8 billion.[2] And that was for a scaled down version. Other estimates were as high as $10 billion.<p>Yes we&#x27;ve had some inflation in the last 30 years. But the  cost increases far outpace inflation. And nobody in government cares. All they do is say &quot;we need it&quot;, without doing any critical thinking. What they really mean is &quot;we want it&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s like the teenagers in my house. They want everything, they don&#x27;t care how much it costs. They haven&#x27;t earned the money they want to spend, so to them any possible costs are meaningless.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_L._Jackson_Memorial_Bridge"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_L._Jackson_Memorial_Brid...</a>

2) No measurement of managers against what actually makes a good manager (ie- only rewarded for results, ignoring if your team hates you and is quitting left and right).
3) First time Founders may not have had great role models or training themselves so they won&#x27;t set a great example either.
4) First time managers are common because you were an early employee or around longer, so I guess you should manage.
5) Misaligned incentives: the only way to get a raise is to go into management
6) Being a manager isn&#x27;t for everyone, but few companies make it safe to go back after 
7) Turnover is tolerated more in the Valley than other places which can hide management problems others companies could never afford (it costs about 2/3rds of a salary to replace someone).<p>Re: Being able to be flat sounds great, but at scale creates a lot of challenges when you need decisions made and you don&#x27;t all fit in a conference room anymore.

I&#x27;m from a working class family, and grew up in an European culture that has somewhat particular views on romance. I&#x27;ve lived in San Francisco for about 5 years now, dating my fair share of people similar to the ones described in the article; including a relationship that lasted a bit over 3 years and ended last spring.<p>Those kinds of people (typically upper middle class Americans born in the 1980s or later) are so in love with themselves that they just have no room for falling in love with anyone else. It&#x27;s easier to waste time on Tinder while obsessing about the best place to go for overpriced brunch and then cry about it to your therapist while your friends tell you that &quot;omg you&#x27;re the best in the world, of course you shouldn&#x27;t settle for anything&quot;, than to pursue deeper, more meaningful interests and relationships.<p>My very unscientific and cynical view of that is that modern consumerist American culture is reaching the paroxysm of fuckery, encouraging everyone to treat their relationships and fellow humans as fungible goods that should be swapped out for this year&#x27;s new, better, shinier model. My solution has just been to just not waste my time with people whose life tends to exhibit the patterns described in the article.<p>If you too belong to the higher upper middle class but can&#x27;t stand that kind of crap, go volunteer and meet people from outside of your social strata. I&#x27;ve been dating someone from a very different, non western culture for the past month or two, whose struggles include more than just what they&#x27;re going to post on their blog next, and it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air in comparison.<p>YMMV.",1442796559

We depend on others to help provide food and water for us, accommodation, etc. Most of us won&#x27;t stay alive if we&#x27;re isolated from the support of other people we depend on. Some autistic people with more extreme cases not only can&#x27;t provide their own food, but also can&#x27;t put on their own clothes.<p>Did you mean to say &quot;Most [autistic] people&quot; in the first line?  Because if you didn&#x27;t, then your comment seems like a non sequitur to me.  Of course most people can take care of themselves.  If they didn&#x27;t, then society would collapse, as there would be more people requiring care than those able to give care.<p>This discussion isn&#x27;t about the interconnectedness of the modern world.  Yes, we no longer live in a hunter-gather society, and most people probably couldn&#x27;t farm their own crops or hunt their own game, but that&#x27;s not what we mean when we&#x27;re talking about people who are unable to care for themselves.  What we mean is someone who is unable to earn money, who cannot navigate purchasing food at grocery stores, who cannot arrange their own accommodation.<p>I live in Manhattan -- because there is no game to hunt here and no available land to farm, would you truly paint me as someone &quot;unable to care for themselves&quot; simply because I have to subsist on food from grocery stores and restaurants that is trucked in from farms in areas with less expensive real estate?

It&#x27;s usually tin flashing covering some kind of insulating material. If the insulation is asbestos, then it&#x27;s not acceptable to have any of it blow off into the wind at all.<p>Next, the surface has to be polished, usually with a rasp or grinder, so that the probe has clean metal to make contact with.<p>Then, the probe, coated in ultrasonic-conducting jelly, gets applied to the surface, and must maintain sufficient contact for as long as it takes for the instrument to get a reading (at least a few seconds, and it&#x27;s not always reliable). This step has been done in the past with robots, albeit in different access environments.<p>Finally, the insulation gets re-applied, covered in tin flashing, and sealed with caulk.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not possible in principle for a flying robot to carry out steps one, two, and four, but I can&#x27;t forsee a technology able to do this within, say, the next ten years.<p>As for RT, you have to understand that a lot of refinery inspections are done in what&#x27;s called turnarounds - where the refinery is <i>turned completely off</i> for a week or two at a time. Tons of contractors are called in to work overtime on top of one another in order to carry out planned maintenance and get the thing back online ASAP (time is money - big money). Obviously, <i>extreme care</i> is taken when doing RT in this kind of environment, because a mistake can be extremely dangerous.<p>It simply isn&#x27;t safe, in any universe, with any technology, to put a radiographic source (actual radioactive elements) on a flying object and zip it around in the middle of a refinery turnaround. Period. Maybe during normal operations, but only at the cost of extreme interruption of everybody&#x27;s work - eg, everybody literally has to exit the entire facility.<p>EDIT: on second thought, having everyone leave the refinery isn&#x27;t even possible without turning the thing off. There are operators who need to be on-site at all times, monitoring and making adjustments to the various processes. And sometimes a valve really does need to be turned by hand ;)",1442796413

I found myself often going stir crazy and ended up spending lots of time in coffee shops/mcdonald&#x27;s/panera/library/whatever in order to just have human contact.<p>I remember after a 3 month stint working virtually alone I found myself going to the grocery store to buy something I didn&#x27;t need just so I could interact with the cashiers.<p>What I found helps is to schedule a place you&#x27;ll be (like a coffee shop) and what you&#x27;ll be doing there and for how long (usually a couple of hours) and stick to that schedule. Go there, work and leave on schedule. And when you&#x27;re there interact with every human you can -- don&#x27;t take the automated checkout kiosk route.<p>Also, it&#x27;s easy to end up working outside of normal office hours simply because there&#x27;s no &quot;break&quot; from work to home.

Over time, the replacement costs will add up and you&#x27;ll &quot;pay more&quot; for clothes.<p>Another example: if you buy in bulk, you can get some items cheaper, but poor people tend to buy in small quantities (e.g. cigarette and alcohol &quot;singles&quot; are a phenomenon that only exist in poor areas for example)<p>This all sounds kind of stupid, but there&#x27;s a rationale for it that makes sense from the inside, here&#x27;s a scenario:<p>I just paid rent, I have $100 left in my bank account and payday isn&#x27;t for 2 weeks. I work a physical labor job and my work boots need replacement. Do I?<p>a) Buy the $29.99 on sale boots at Walmart and hope they last for a couple months?<p>b) Buy the $259.99 boots at the high-end boot store and they&#x27;ll last for a couple years?<p>c) Buy the $84.99 boots at the discount shoe store and they&#x27;ll probably last for 6 months to a year?<p>Of course the answer is a). This leaves me with $50 to eat on for two weeks. I can&#x27;t afford b) no matter what so it may as well not exist and c) leaves me starving before payday.<p>You count pennies when you&#x27;re poor, you know exactly how much small amounts of things cost because you spend all your time buying small amounts of things and balancing out the bottom few rungs of Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs against your daily purchases.<p>Getting out of this cycle is <i>very</i> hard. It&#x27;s not like you can save up enough to be worthwhile. Even with $5/mo left over at the end of every month, it takes 52 months to save up to buy the b) boots.<p>This means also that you live in a constant state of emergency. Literally <i>everything</i> is an emergency -- and this short circuits your ability to prioritize and make what seems like rational decisions. It also means that whatever spare money/time you have you may as well spend on stupid bullshit because you&#x27;ve convinced yourself it won&#x27;t make any difference anyway.<p>It really is a vicious cycle.",1442795511

10249727,comment,10238797,10238797,0,0,bobthechef,,,"The article was an entertaining read. However, it contains a few errors.<p>First, Spinoza was not an atheist. He was a pantheist. He identified nature/universe with God and tried to overcome the infamous &quot;mind&quot;/matter duality posed by Descartes by claiming that both were but aspects of the infinite substance, namely, God. That is, he subscribed to a certain panpsychism. Comparisons to Buddhism are actually very superficial. Other attempts at surmounting Cartesian dualism included Malbranche&#x27;s occasionalism which claimed that God was the bridge between the two (there is a humorous anecdote that on his deathbed he was asked what good the world is if God was the cause of our ideas, after which he purportedly sighed in realization and died).<p>Second, I don&#x27;t know what it is about Hume, but he seems to be quite popular among those with little philosophical background...which would be fine if there were some humility attached to the enthusiasm. Hume is notorious for misunderstanding Aristotle, never having read his works, and relied instead on mediocre secondary sources. Furthermore, (his) skepticism is self-defeating and incoherent. I found a good link that describes some of the objections for those who are interested: <a href=""http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/06/hume-science-and-religion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/06/hume-science-and-rel...</a><p>Third - and this is more of an observation - Buddhism, and perhaps especially of the ostensibly Tibetan Californian variety, seems to be one of those dying fads in some aging academic circles who hadn&#x27;t yet properly digested it or moved on to some other colorful New Age Americanism (popular adoration for the Dalai Lama has always been incomprehensible to me; most who do haven&#x27;t the slightest idea of whom they&#x27;re adoring). Lhasa is far enough from the West that envisioning it as a sort of Shangri-La where all of the nastiness of the West is absent. It&#x27;s kind of a secular New Jerusalem or Promised Land (the truth about Tibetan theocracy isn&#x27;t quite so pretty). To her credit, the author admits the first bit.<p>Fourth - another observation - the Jesuits seem to be a kind of least hated order in the Catholic Church among atheists because of certain perceptions I won&#x27;t elaborate here. These perceptions seem to stem from a certain Enlightenment inheritance that portrayed the Catholic Church as a stale, largely monolithic institution wallowing in superstition and unilaterally bent on destroying Science-with-a-Big-S and keeping people ignorant. Many accusation are outright fabrications or comic book worthy oversimplification that never seem to get checked by armchair historians (e.g., the Galileo affair) because the vilification of imaginary enemies is too juicy to rectify. Whatever apprehensions one might have about the faith, it is important to remember that history requires proper interpretation by keeping in mind the times and a sample of the relevant facts. For instance, if a medieval king punishes a vociferous heretic (most were clergymen, btw) by imprisoning him, we must try to understand the historical context. Was it a merciful punishment for that time period? Why was heresy seen as a threat exactly (no facile answers, please)? What did it mean to have your book placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (hint: probably not what you think if what you think is the stock answer of reactionary anti-Catholics)? I mention these consideration to inspire a search for a deeper understanding of the actual nature of such things...for those who can and dare.",1442794440

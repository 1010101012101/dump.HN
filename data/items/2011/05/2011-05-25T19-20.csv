     from first-class functions
</code></pre>
Dealing with first-class functions in Scala is awkward (getting and returning functions requires juggling with generics, currying is half-baked), and if you are ready to make that compromise it can be argued that Java doesn't need first-class functions as long as it has anonymous inner classes.<p><pre><code>     in statically typed functional languages, 
     type inference
</code></pre>
Scala doesn't have the Hindley-Milner type inference that ML/Haskell have. It only does local type-inference, saving you from some boilerplate, but other than that it doesn't and cannot have type-inference where it is truly needed - in the declaration of functions / generic types.<p><pre><code>    The entire Haskell standard library could be 
    rewritten, more or less, in Scala
</code></pre>
Haskell relies a lot on type-classes for its polymorphism, which aren't really possible in Scala, and if you are going to work around that, well, the entire Haskell library could be rewritten in Java too with those workarounds, only with more boiler-plate.<p>The question is, does Scala provide enough value to bother with its deficiencies (the type system is more complex and awkward, the generated code more inefficient especially for Android, which doesn't have the luxury of the Java SE GC).<p>Well, it does, but for Android at least, a version of Java that had local type inference and a lighter syntax for instantiating anonymous classes -- would have been so much better. And personally I'm not ready to commit to C++ version 2.",1306353599

People contributing to the index on a private server could do whatever they want but since that instance of the index is not public, no one else will care about what the owner has done to it. Forks can be pushed to a public staging area where others can view it and verify it's accuracy, and then the major players can merge those changes into their forks.<p>The complaint (with github) that it is hard to figure out the canonical repo is also invalid in this model, as one can start with a fork of Google or Yahoo's public repo, and then build their own through merging or hacking directly on it, just like one can fork Linus' Linux kernel, and then merge in other's forks to incorporate other changes.<p>Remember, the index itself, as in the raw data taken in by GoogleBot or Yahoo! Slurp bot, would be the shared information. The analysis of the data, as in pagerank and other factors that Google decides makes one page more relevant to a keyword than the other, would not be shared as that is the bread and butter of each engine.",1306353150

Indeed, the very new and deeply intractable problem of the law vs. reality is that in the digital world, anything you do involves copies. Suddenly, theres no part of human intellectual activity thats outside copyright regulation. If anything, wisdom regards this with horror.<p>The current, and notoriously short-sighted beneficiaries of the copyright cartel see this as a good thing, as it appears to hand them a massive (and totally unearned) expansion of their power. The (mostly young) people who are most exposed to this hubris display a reassuringly mature recognition of this badness, and resist accordingly.<p>Good government (i.e. government of, by, and for the people) would avoid open conflict by adjusting the law to the benefit of the people's constitutional liberties, challenging the old commercial order to adapt peacefully or die gracefully. The fact that this isn't happening is de facto evidence of growing corruption. If anything, the wisdom of age makes this less - not more - tolerable as time goes by.<p>After all, there is no precedent (at least in America) that suggests a system providing total domination over all aspects of cultural and intellectual is a good and worthwhile thing. Indeed, much of America's involvement in the 20th Century revolved around violent opposition to the horrific and miserable places that did try to institute this level of control. Today, we're discovering that we can't even be 'friends' with countries that behave like this (Exhibit A: Egypt), since majorities everywhere find these orders deeply hateful, rendering them inherently unstable.

Opening the index, while good for the web, would not necessarily be good for the company. Google could mitigate that by licensing the data: for data more than X hours old, you get free access; for data newer than that, you pay a license fee to Google. Furthermore, integrate the data with Google's cloud hosting to provide a way to trivially create map/reduce implementations that use the data.<p>3. On the other side, what a great opportunity the index could provide for startups. Maintaining a live index of the web is costly and getting more and more difficult as people lock down their robots.txt.

The line moves the smallest amount possible each iteration (1 pixel for example).<p>After the line has moved one pixel, a new angle is picked for the line move, from 0-360, and it increments 1 more pixel. If the randomly generated line crosses the center line of the square (if you folded the square in half from left to right) force the line to randomly pick a new angle before incrementing.<p>Do not allow the line to cross over itself.<p>Now you have your first line. Take this line, replicate it, rotating it 90 degrees, then 180, then 270.<p>This is your first square. Set the program to keep generating new squares, add rules as you see fit.<p>Now you have more solutions to this puzzle than you can count.<p>Edit: This is pretty badly explained, but it is based on the idea of a single line leaving the midpoint, moving randomly until it reaches an edge. You then replicate that single line 3 more times, each rotating by 90 additional degrees.",1306351250

2585111,story,,,5,5,hxf148,"How do you market your startup on a shoestring?",,"Since launching a startup (http://infostripe.com) earlier this year I have been learning a lot about how things truly work online. I've been around the internet since the mid nineties, I have worked in web development throughout that time (for a government) and have intensely followed tech news, podcasts and events very closely as an interested observer. I have gotten a lot out of that practice but it was truly when I tried to reach out with my own thing that I discovered the height and depth that is the 4th wall of the marketing underbelly.<p>We are not yet in a position to spend what resources we have on a lot of things so it has been a grassroots campaign to reach out to tech punditry, journalists, bloggers along with some minor experimental spends on Adwords, Stumbleupon and Facebook Ads. This has been somewhat successful on small scale but we have run into some interesting observations.<p>- It seems to matter who you know more then what you are if you have little to spend.
- Tech journalism is in some corners a vapid recycling of the same daily hot air with very little investigative instinct.
- There is a lot going on each day online and getting heard is tough.
- Spammers have made us all afraid of each other and new things.<p>So the question, How do you market your whatever as a small yet unfunded startup on a shoestring?",1306350422

In his seminal work ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" Thomas Kuhn pointed out that paradigm shifts (a term he coined) don't happen because lots of people who used to think one way start thinking another. Rather, a very select few who are capable of changing their minds start thinking differently, providing a guide around which new entrants can form their own opinions. This continues until the advocates for the displaced view have reduced themselves to a minority by literally dying off.<p>In other words, you never see a true paradigm shift take place in a single generation. Two or three is the more realistic norm.",1306350371

Now, it may be unavailable because the user said, ""make the Internet unavailable"" instead of being unavailable because the phone is inside a tunnel... but the end result is the same.  An action the user took caused your app to be unable to contact the Internet.  If this is a problem, pop a dialog saying, ""hey, get out of that tunnel if you want to play my game.""<p>The ""permissions"" that a user gives to the device say that the app has permission to use the Internet.  The permission does not make the Internet magically 100% available.  It may well never be available.  All you're getting is permission to use the Internet if the Internet happens to exist.<p>Anyway, I know you're trolling, and that's fine.  Because your opinion doesn't matter: it's my phone, my internet connection, and my open-source firmware.  Your software is an invited guest.  If you don't want your app to run on my phone, don't let it get on my phone.  Once you've done that, it's mine to take with me into tunnels (virtual or otherwise) whenever the fuck I want, and there's not a thing in the world you can do to stop me.

Solving that may turn out to be mundane, but it may lead to the development of new techniques and insights.  You never know.  It's like the Collatz Conjecture.  Simple to state, no one knows if it's true, no one know how to prove (or disprove) it, and who knows what techniques may be developed to answer it.<p>You say there are ""nearly infinitely many ways to accomplish this.""  Can I ask, what do you mean by ""nearly infinite""?

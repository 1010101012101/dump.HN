7309776,comment,7303533,7306437,2,0,tsmith5432,,,"I don&#x27;t have any of the old papers / results.  But my recollection is that the Lisp workstations greatly outperformed LISP on a contemporary VAX for a given cost, in part because of the workstation&#x27;s microcoded instruction set tailored to Lisp.   Over time, though, commodity hardware increased significantly in relative performance simply due to the economies of scale in producing it.<p>You might&#x27;ve been able to buy a Xerox workstation for, say, $15K-$20K, while a VAX box was over $100K.  BUT for a production system, the VAX could run multiple Lisp processes at the same time.  (I&#x27;m guessing at costs here, it&#x27;s been too long.)<p>Also, Richard Gabriel did a bunch of Common Lisp benchmarks, might help to look for them.  (Great fellow.)<p>The real threat to Symbolics et al, circa 1987, was things like Gold Hill Common Lisp running on, say, a IBM PC/AT with a 286 chip and maybe a meg of memory.  At, perhaps, $3,000.  It ran pretty fast, the Gold Hill tech folks were very good.  But GHCL had an unsophisticated development environment compared to Symbolics / Xerox.<p>As excellent as the workstation environments were for development, a market demands that you eventually deliver a cost effective product into customers&#x27; hands.

At 3 shifts/day * 5 days gives the really too nice and round 400 / shift (or almost 1 a minute off all lines give a 7 hour production).  And this is with Toyota&#x27;s lean changes so making significant improvements would be hard.  For example if you watch UltimateFactory you can determining the takt time in your head of other auto manufacturing facilities, some including GM are able do do 450+ in their plants (btw for those of you in the EU and you ever get the chance see Porche&#x27;s factory, it is fantastic).  But the fact is that the cars being made are not the same and so you might be able to get that efficiency gains simply from the smaller number of value added steps required.  Really it all depends upon the amount of waste (non-value add) that is in the system and how easy it is to make improvements.  Given the opportunity I would love to checkout Tesla&#x27;s facilities and would probably geek out more on it than the car.  25% might be doable, but without more real information I guess this is like saying sports team X could win Y without looking at the current stats.",1393466036

The big problem with the shuttle was that it was a non-solution to arguably a non-problem, and having created this very expensive non-solution, a mission had to be found for it. And it also turned out to be horribly unsafe (aside from the people lost in the Apollo fire -- which was during a training exercise, all of the US casualties in space vehicles have been from the shuttle).<p>E.g. one of the highest profile achievements of the shuttle program was repairing Hubble.

Haskell seemed like a good win there (other folks might use Go, or whatever). It turned out to be really easy to write a network server in Haskell that receives the messages that the service needs to receive. Also, it was the first time I used a language that had good (or really, any) pattern matching, and I&#x27;m sold on it.<p>The &quot;business&quot; logic of the system is all currently in Racket. It could certainly have been written in Haskell, but I&#x27;m still getting up to speed in it, whereas I was able to get pretty minimal functionality up and running with Racket very easily.<p>Right now only the web interface is Clojure. I briefly considered using Yesod for the web piece, but it seemed really complicated. And although Racket has a nice web server, it requires buying into the &quot;continuations&quot; style that they advocate (or rolling your own web libraries, which seemed like a bad idea for this project).<p>I think the continuation-based approach for web servers is certainly valid, and maybe even technically better, but they&#x27;re swimming against the tide with that approach, and as web programming is so far my least favorite part of building this system, I wasn&#x27;t willing to buy into that enterprise.<p>Thankfully, I was able to get a Clojure web app up and running very quickly (basically just Ring and Compojure).<p>The system is designed where there&#x27;s pretty hard boundaries between all the parts, so by the time all is said and done, it might all be written in the same language; but that&#x27;s not necessarily a design-goal. I figure different languages seem to have different strengths, and there&#x27;s not really a good reason for me to try and shoehorn everything into one.",1393465526

It was built using Rails 2.0 without any attempt to upgrade it since it was first deployed. Since I really don&#x27;t have time - my time is taken up managing 3 to 4 to 5 other projects at the same time as managing this web site - I&#x27;ve been unable to spend the pretty large amount of time it would take to bump the application up two major versions so that incremental updates become easier. Nor does the company want to pay me to do that.<p>I think a lot of applications reach an early end of life because of the nature of subcontracting. You build the application, your contract reaches an end, and then the company wants to stop paying for upgrades, seeing them as optional. They will only pay you to keep administering the existing site indefinitely.<p>But where I might differ? Maybe that&#x27;s the way it should be, short of being reckless (you should always be applying security updates). Technology and methodology changes so much in three or four years that retrofitting new features on the old, crufty application seems like going backwards. Ultimately the company ends up wanting to rebuild the whole thing. In the case of the application I&#x27;m talking about, almost all of its features would be done better by an existing CMS system. I would feel sick to my stomach adding new CMS features that I know would work more beautifully inside of off-the-shelf CMS software that has been extended to complete the custom task.",1393464896

However, this does gloss over the major fact that this is a bad situation to find yourself in, and you are much better off spending energy getting yourself into a good situation than you are swimming upstream in a bad one.  And while I&#x27;m sure being in YC does help with fundraising (extra social proof), you certainly don&#x27;t need to be in YC to raise money successfully.<p>If you don&#x27;t think you will be good at fundraising (because you don&#x27;t know a lot of rich people, you are a first-timer, you aren&#x27;t good at pitching, etc), then you should be operating your business in a way where you don&#x27;t need to fundraise.  Be incredibly incredibly lean, generate revenue from day 1, figure out how to incrementally achieve ambitious goals, etc.  There are a lot more ways to run a successful business than there are to run a successful fundraising --- investors are all looking for the same thing, and they could all be wrong.  But if you grow fast enough or make enough money they&#x27;ll come around.<p>There isn&#x27;t too much reason to get into more details because pg wrote the canonical piece on fundraising, which certainly applies to non-YC companies as well: <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/fr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/fr.html</a><p>But generally, the premise of this whole article is flawed.

And doesn&#x27;t seem to have any concept of how UI/UX should be done.<p>Don&#x27;t be harsh. We all have different ideas of what wireframes are.<p>> Wireframes are typically used for determining how much of each screen something will take up. After that you move to a Mock up.<p>I guess web design is a bit different from the more app design field I&#x27;m used to, where wireframe is more of an interaction tool used to describe non-visual user experience and flow while the visual toolkit/guide does what the web wireframe would otherwise (not just layout, but everything else visual also). Mockup is mostly used in the early concept and planning stages before design begins in earnest. You move up from wireframe and visual guides to...prototypes.",1393462985

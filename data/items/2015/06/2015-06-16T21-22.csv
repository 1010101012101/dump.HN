The big assumption in the industry right now is that &quot;what people REALLY want isn&#x27;t necessarily the same as what they SAY they want&quot;.<p>But isn&#x27;t that dreadfully cynical to put the emphasis on the &quot;really want&quot; side?  Like - I want to eat healthy, but if a bowl of crappy chips were put in front of me, I&#x27;d probably eat some.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t want to eat healthy, though.  It doesn&#x27;t mean I REALLY want chips.<p>It&#x27;s really just that they&#x27;re invested in serving our urges rather than what we think of as important.<p>Think of it as our &quot;better selves&quot; versus our &quot;worse selves&quot;.

9728952,comment,9727098,9728830,0,0,bcantrill,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m Joyent&#x27;s CTO and I work for Scott.  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t comment on something on which I&#x27;m so obviously conflicted, but the record needs to be set straight on this point:  Scott was taken entirely out of context by the reporter.  In reference to the node.js incubator, the reporter (reasonably) asked about io.js.  As an attempt at humor (albeit perhaps an ill advised one), Scott responded with: &quot;IO.js -- what&#x27;s that?&quot;  When there was an awkward silence, it was instantly clear to Scott that his attempt at humor had fallen flat -- and it was immediately clarified to the reporter that it was a joke: that he obviously knew what io.js was, and that the emphasis of the program was on node.js.  That the reporter published the quote anyway (implying that Scott didn&#x27;t, in fact, know what io.js was) was to take Scott grossly out of context. When we later asked ReadWriteWeb to clarify that Scott had been taken out of context, they flatly refused -- which is unfortunate, because it has resulted in heaps of undeserved abuse. (Many who have been involved with io.js have, in fact, gone out of their way to praise working with Scott.[1][2])<p>Now if I may inject my personal (if biased) opinion:  the objective of the reporter was not to get the facts straight in this case, but rather to get eyeballs on the page -- ginning conflict if and as necessary.  This is unfortunate, but it&#x27;s not at all a surprise.  It should also serve as a warning to all who engage with those who write about current events for a living:  some (many, in fact) hold themselves up as journalists and work hard to get the story right -- but not all do, and one must be very careful, especially when attempting humor that might be deliberately taken out of context!<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/mikeal/status/555572909247574017"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/mikeal/status/555572909247574017</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/dshaw/status/610821802466639873"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/dshaw/status/610821802466639873</a>",1434491829

See this excerpt from &quot;Are Chickens Smarter Than Toddlers?&quot;:<p>In 1996, I discovered Dr. Lesley Rogers’s book The Development of Brain and Behaviour in the Chicken (1995) in the Beltsville, Maryland Agricultural Library outside Washington, DC. I sat on the floor of the stacks, reading it in tears, because Rogers was affirming that birds are intelligent beings, and that prejudice, not science, says otherwise. She said, “it is now clear that birds have cognitive capacities equivalent to those of mammals” (p. 17). She said, “With increased knowledge of the behaviour and cognitive abilities of the chicken has come the realization that the chicken is not an inferior species to be treated merely as a food source” (p. 213).<p>She explained that a chick “hatches with a well-developed brain, immediately able to make decisions and to form memories” (p. 118). Of battery cages for hens and all forms of industrial conditions for chickens, she said: “In no way can these living conditions meet the demands of a complex nervous system designed to form a multitude of memories and to make complex decisions” (p. 218). Citing recent demonstrations of complex cognition in birds including chickens and others once denigrated by mainstream scientists as “unquestionably low in the scale of avian evolution,” Rogers called for more research in the field of comparative cognition, given how recent studies had “thrown the fallacies of previous assumptions about the inferiority of avian cognition into sharp relief” (p. 218).<p>I was ecstatic. A bona fide avian scientist was saying what I already knew to be true about birds, and about chickens in particular, in forthright language that could be quoted without ellipses. She spoke of “the cognitive demands of the hitherto underestimated chicken brain” (p. 213).<p>The chicken’s brain is equipped to enable it to meet the complex demands of the natural world in which this brain took shape. There is a fit between the total mental system of the chicken and the tropical forest habitat in which chickens evolved. Chickens have thrived for tens of thousands of years within the complex ecology of their forest world – a world that is reflected in their genetic makeup. The neurophysiology of the chicken embodies a system of interactions between the genetic, hormonal and environmental factors that figure in the developing embryo and express themselves in the adult bird.<p><a href=""http://www.upc-online.org/thinking/are_chickens_smarter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.upc-online.org/thinking/are_chickens_smarter.html</a>",1434491661

Too many things would be unknown, and it is easy in both C and C++ to, at compile time, check the sizeof(size_t) and perform totally different behaviour depending on the value.<p>I can see an issue with template instantiation in C++: for example, if a template uses SFINAE to specialize a template for types of certain sizes, that needs to be evaluated purely at the C++->LLVM stage of compilation.<p>What is the compile time part of C do you mean? sizeof(T) is evaluated at compile time of course, but it would still produce pseudocode like:<p><pre><code>    if (4 < 16) { // sizeof(T) replaced with 4
        // do something
    } else {
        // do something else
    }
</code></pre>
Of course, an optimizer would likely constant-fold that conditional expression to remove the branch entirely, but
I&#x27;m having a difficult time seeing how one could perform different behavior <i>at compile time</i> with sizeof(T) in C.",1434490443

9728839,comment,9726514,9726514,0,0,vixsomnis,,,"Micropayments are not an option right now due to the friction: no one is
going to give you their payment information. It requires a large amount
of trust.<p>One particular advertising model I like is internal advertising. I&#x27;ve
been brainstorming a business model to compete with a webcomics ranking
service that removes the need to rely on external advertising services
(Project Wonderful, Google AdSense, etc.). In my opinion, this is the
least intrusive monetization strategy.<p>Since your ideal users would be generating content, with the intention
of having as many people as possible view and interact with their
content, you should use this to your advantage. Instead of
advertisements, you have &quot;curated content&quot;. Since you have a wealth of
internal data (from, say running Piwik analytics) and can categorize
the content on your service, content creators can pay to have their
stories presented to users, beyond whatever free presentation they get.<p>Meanwhile, you can return some of that overall money to reward content
creators based on the number of users they&#x27;ve generated, or perhaps
users returning on a normal basis. This should incentivize better
content.<p>The downside to this model is that you already need a sizeable
viewership for any creators to pay for sponsorship. You&#x27;d have to invest
heavily in your service before you get any returns at all, especially
since you have to attract quality content creators.<p>In the first 6 months or so, I&#x27;d imagine any &quot;rewards&quot; would have to be
given out of your personal finances, since you won&#x27;t have people
throwing money at you until the rewards for purchasing sponsorship are
tangible.<p>Advertising isn&#x27;t much better in terms of income, however. You make almost no money
when your userbase is small, and the adverts tend to make users think
less of your site (and not come back).<p>(Disclaimer: I have never tried this before, although I intend to. I
also doubt I&#x27;m the first to think of this model.)",1434490408

OpenCV can help you start off by easily being able to detect that there is an eye in frame, but I think you are on your own beyond that.<p>My general approach was to use haarcascades to detect that an eye was in frame. Then you have to isolate the iris, and pupil. You can use Hough Circles or the Daugman algorithm for segmentation. I got a reasonable result using the Daugman algorithm, but Hough circles seemed to be more erratic. I had a huge problem with reflections though, which I think it is known that the Daugman algorithm suffers from. You pretty much have to take the picture of the eye in a controlled setting where you flash a light in the subjects eye such that the reflection in the eye is a small isolated circle. Even then I wasn&#x27;t always to get a correct result. I think I may have not implemented the algorithm perfectly though.<p>I never got farther than that, but even if you are able to capture the eye perfectly you then have to actually build up a model of the persons features and then be able to compare it.<p>I would be interested if anyone else had better luck than I did.",1434489568

LastPass alleviates all of that. People make the same claims about TouchID (it&#x27;s not secure, look at these theoretical bypasses, etc) but the fact is (which I thought I pointed out earlier) that <i>convenient security is better than no security</i> and no security is what you&#x27;re going to get.<p>You think the government can&#x27;t download things from your Dropbox and you think they can&#x27;t decrypt your database?

Even if they can&#x27;t get to your password, they&#x27;ll just go straight to Google or worst case scenario, straight to AT&T. The difference between encrypting like SpiderOak vs uploading an encrypted file like DropBox is that DropBox can hand over your password database to anyone they want to give it to. SpiderOak can&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t need to try to hide the fact that you have a password database, no one can tell in the first place. Security through obscurity isn&#x27;t no security, it&#x27;s just poor security and poor security is better than nothing (and far better when combined with good security).<p>You&#x27;re using a password manager to keep your accounts safe from petty criminals and identity thieves, not from APTs or shady governments. And if you&#x27;re using DropBox, the government probably already has it. I guess you&#x27;d have to ask Condoleezza Rice about that.<p>Use whatever you want, everyone has different needs and opinions.

In my case, I had to relocate to a small town in Kentucky for the job where (at the time) no American tech worker was willing to move to. I was essentially hired out of frustration on part of the hiring manager. I had other job offers but decided to go with that company because of it was a reputed (Fortune 500) company.<p>That said, numerous issues plague the program:<p>1. I noticed my fellow H1B co-workers who were Indian were paid much lower than I was. (I’m not Indian and I was paid market-rate). I’m not sure why but it seems companies think Indian workers are more desperate and will take less money.<p>2. H1B workers have absolutely no power. Your boss/company really does OWN you. You have little room for negotiating raises/work environment/responsibilities/schedule etc. If your boss doesn’t like you, you might end up in legal limbo in a few years.<p>3. H1B workers are constantly worried about the company’s bottom line/future/decisions. It’s very difficult to change jobs and a layoff/termination automatically invalidates the visa. Even if a H1B worker manages to switch jobs, the time limit on the visa doesn’t reset and the new working conditions might actually be worse than previous company.
This lack of mobility also has a dampening effect on the H1B worker’s career. Six years is a long time in the tech industry and H1B workers usually end up stuck with old technological stacks because they were unable to move on to jobs with better opportunities.<p>4. Many companies bring H1B workers on board with promises of sponsoring a green card knowing fully well that they have no intention of ever doing so. Some companies tell H1B workers that they have filed an LCA or are working on some other step without actually doing anything. Reason: It costs money.<p>5. Some companies ONLY hire H1Bs even if domestic workers are available. This is because they can get away with paying SOME H1B workers lower wages and H1B workers are more easily controlled.
Also, some unscrupulous managers use the H1B system to hire their friends and relatives who are absolutely unqualified for the job.
I can’t prove it, but I’m sure their is a shadow market where some managers demand BRIBES from H1B applicants in illegal pay-for-play hiring schemes.<p>6. H1B workers have been brought in by companies (like the Disney case) to replace American workers. Sometimes, the domestic workers are forced to train their replacements before being laid off. This has caused a lot of resentment towards H1B workers.<p>7. The Indian “Consultancy” companies: Tata, Wipro, Cognizant, etc. — Too much to talk about. These companies are the worst offenders and chronic abusers of the H1B system. I’d implore both American workers and H1B applicants to stay away from any company that has a large swath of H1B workers — read: INDIAN",1434489220

EV certificates do not guarantee the site isnt using a insecure cipher. EV certificates do not guarantee that the private key was not sent via plain text in an email while a network admin was installing it.

A registered TM is prima facia evidence of an enforceable TM and ownership;<p>2.  The legal standard for violation of the TM is <i>likelihood of confusion by the consumer</i> (i.e. people are buying Fony intending to buy Sony).  The article mentions certain issues such as category/class of goods, but notes even that is not determinative of actual infringement.  Also, mentions the concept of dilution of TM (the infringer is hawking a substandard product), but this is not a requirement of the analysis, the infringing product could be superior and still infringe the TM rights.<p>3.  At the end of the day the legal standard of <i>infringement</i> is very subjective, and while not directly mentioned, it is not only possible but occurs regularly where different Courts will arrive at different conclusions as to whether there is TM infringement.  The one thing I disagree with is the claim this is an unsettled area of law, certainly it is more subjective than I like in my legal standard, but it is not unsettled.",1434488406

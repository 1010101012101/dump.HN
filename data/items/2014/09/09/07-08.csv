8289152,comment,8287479,8288264,2,0,k-mcgrady,,,"I doubt it. I won&#x27;t repost my other comment which addresses this [1] but in my opinion people like Dawkins are fanatics. And science/atheist fanatics are no better than religious fanatics. Religious fanatics drive me away from religion but Dawkins fanaticism drives me away from atheism.<p>I think it&#x27;s calm, rational argument that has swayed me most away from religion. Just a simple thought experiment:<p>1. You think religions like scientology are crazy.\n2. You believe in a man who was born of a virgin, died, rose from the dead, and who hundreds of millions of people eat and drink every weekend.\n3. How can you call them crazy when you believe that?<p>Even still it&#x27;s hard for me to get off the fence but simple arguments like that, which aren&#x27;t arrogant and totally patronising, but lay out the facts in an honest way, are what convince people.<p>I think the problem with a more aggressive approach is arrogance. Most religious people probably accept they could be wrong - their belief is based on faith. But aggressive atheists argue that religious people are wrong and stupid when from a religious persons perspective the atheist has no proof they are wrong. Evolution is real and correct but isn&#x27;t proof their is no God. Atheists say it&#x27;s not up to them to prove their is no God, it&#x27;s up to religious people to prove their is. But if you&#x27;re calling someone out as wrong they will think you need to prove it. Because there is and never will be a way to disprove the existence of a God I don&#x27;t think this approach works. You have to present the facts in a way that is honest but in a way that the other person hasn&#x27;t thought about before.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8289140"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8289140</a>",1410249233

8289148,comment,8288119,8288449,2,0,jacquesm,,,"> Another reason is that YC is the gold standard, and having that endorsement opens all kinds of doors.<p>Yes it does, but it <i>actually</i> should not. By becoming an endorsement YC loses a bit of its effectiveness and the eventual rate of success will probably decline measurably.<p>Ideally investors would properly investigate the companies they intend to invest in rather than to just use YC as a way to increase their probability of scoring a hit. That&#x27;s just another variation on the &#x27;dumb money&#x27; theme and the field as a whole will lose from such inefficient allocation.<p>It will put fewer wood behind more arrows. Even though YC companies are probably already over-valued it would be more efficient if VC capital would concentrate on those companies the VCs actually believe will succeed rather than to see these blanket investments in anything that moves that has been backed by YC.<p>It even matters to the founders.<p>As long as there is a glut of capital chasing these companies a number of companies that did not go through YC will likely be passed up on simply because they don&#x27;t have the stamp of approval that YC offers.<p>This is a gap that might be large enough for a smart VC to exploit. Ignore the YC stamp of approval, treat all applications equally and invest in a couple of dark horses that did not make it to YC for various reasons (geography, timing, bad fit), but to have their application roughly around the same time as YC has theirs.<p>That way they can use the YC &#x27;vetted&#x27; companies as the benchmark against which they can evaluate their batch of &#x27;dark horses&#x27; substantially increasing the hit rate of the latter without having to compete with all the other investors in the YC batch.",1410249124

Over the last year I&#x27;ve been swayed towards atheism but people like Dawkins turn me off.

He&#x27;s right about a lot of things but it seems he and a lot of &#x27;famous&#x27; atheists just trade in religious fanaticism for science fanaticism.

8289119,comment,8282048,8285223,2,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> It&#x27;s like pointing to a guy walking his dog at the park after noticing a parked car with it&#x27;s lights on, and saying &quot;there&#x27;s the owner in the car&quot; vs &quot;there&#x27;s the owner of the car&quot;.<p>So here&#x27;s a bit of nuance for me.  I can parse &quot;the header<i>s</i> of the packet<i>s</i>&quot; in one of two ways:<p>1) For each packet, the header of said packet (clearly referring to the IP layer header)<p>2) For each packet, the header<i>s</i> of said packet (ambiguous)<p>&quot;The header of a packet&quot; is relatively unambiguous, and akin to your analogy.  I would grant this kind of mistake to be rare, although I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;d agree on how rare.  Certainly not impossibly rare - more common than those spurious 3s in my own writing, and yet we see one of those quite clearly.<p>&quot;The header<i>s</i> of a packet&quot; is more ambiguous.  A packet has only one header.  The header has options, so that could be what&#x27;s being referred to.  Or it could be more loosely referring to metadata, or headers of another protocol contained within the packet data.<p>I could see myself using this kind of loose terminology quite easily.  I&#x27;m not a network engineer, I don&#x27;t do switch configuration, I don&#x27;t have to get down and dirty with IP layer issues with MTU and MRU misconfigurations, so it&#x27;s quite possible I&#x27;m more prone to this kind of mistake than you are.<p>I&#x27;m just a programmer who&#x27;s occasionally asked to dabble with layer 7 networking stuff, and mostly interact with this when I e.g. fire up Wireshark to debug why my Amazon S3 authentication isn&#x27;t working, only to discover Unity&#x27;s WWW class ignored the (HTTP) headers I wanted to send on iOS (explaining why it worked perfectly fine on Windows!)",1410248036

Even if China just up and landed an occupying force on Japan&#x27;s Senkaku islands.<p>Perhaps not over the Senkaku Islands, but I think that if China were aggressive toward one of the four main islands (or Okinawa), the Japanese people would definitely support war -- even if not in actual name. I was really surprised at the general sentiment toward the proposed amendment in that it was a lot more supportive than I personally would have expected from a heiwa-boke Japan.<p>Especially against China though, there&#x27;s already a lot of dark, anti-China sentiment (especially with the recent chicken fiasco) that I feel like could be stirred up into support for a non-War armed conflict/proportional response... though I don&#x27;t know how the people would act after seeing the results.<p>Edit: In addition, I feel like war-weary Americans would be similarly ambivalent about entering war against China if China tried to annex, say, Wake Island.<p>> As with the Philippines, I think the USA is the main deterrent to Chinese aggression.<p>This is for me personally the number one reason I don&#x27;t think that China would be willing to escalate against Japan, actually.

If it came to it, I&#x27;d take the rUK one for now, it&#x27;s not a big issue - it&#x27;s like all the people I know who&#x27;re from other countries and also have a UK passport.",1410247537

8289095,comment,8287479,8287479,1,0,kiliancs,,,"If we accept that nations (that is, communities of people with a feeling of belonging to the same group that share history, culture, language, traditions, etc.) exist, then we must accept that they should be considered equal in the same way people are considered equal: they should treat each other as equal and should care about the wellbeing of each other. They should look for their own wellbeing, but consider the common good of all nations to be even more important.<p>Given these principles, the world should encourage nations to take care of their own issues and reach the maturity and capability to function economically and advance culturally and socially, and to interact with the rest in spirit of cooperation; they would provide the means for that.<p>This would be, in my opinion, one of the requirements to ensure lasting peace, as well as a potent boost for the world economy. The alternative is that these nations are not recognized or only partially recognized, and that they are unable to manage their own issues the way they wish, and to have their own voice in the world, for so many of the important matters are global nowadays. Ignoring them will always lead to growing instability, as these nations and their aspirations will not disappear -and if they do, that would be a loss for humanity.<p>We have the tools of democracy to achieve this peacefully. The editorial of the NYT a few days ago[1] talked about the value of achieving this democratically. Xavier Sala-i-MartÃ­n, economist at Columbia University, often explains a story that makes the same point (I tried to improve Google&#x27;s translation a little):<p>&quot;What if an alien interested in bringing democracy to its planet suddenly appeared in our living room and asked us how do we earthlings make collective decisions? Surely we would explain that to choose our leaders, we vote; that to pass our laws, we vote; you to decide how public money is spent, we vote, and to set taxes, we vote. If, suddenly, the galactic sir stood in front of a world map and told us: &quot;I guess you also vote in order to change the borders on this map, right?&quot;. We would have to embarrassedly respond: &quot;No, the borders can be changed only by fighting&quot;. Given this bizarre revelation, poor Mr. green would turn green (if that was not its original color) and would run, exclaiming that we are barbarians.&quot;[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/opinion/scotlands-identity-put-to-a-vote.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/opinion/scotlands-identity...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.caffereggio.net%2F2012%2F11%2F17%2Fel-col%25C2%25B7lectiu-wilson-de-xavier-sala-i-martin-en-la-vanguardia%2F&sandbox=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&tl=en&u=h...</a>",1410247225

I mean, in the end game they have nukes and Japan doesn&#x27;t. But even if it didn&#x27;t get to that level, China is a totalitarian regime with a history of brutally suppressing dissent, and I also assume that China would be willing to lose a lot more lives to make gains.<p>Japan is a high-functioning democracy, and has been one of the most peaceful advanced economies of the world since losing the war. Before that, yeah, they were a definite bad actor on the world stage. But they haven&#x27;t committed any military aggression toward <i>any</i> country in more than 65 years.<p>It is my personal opinion that there is almost no way that the people of Japan (where I live, though I am American) would support a war against China.

In this case the &#x27;research&#x27; was obviously done by first letting someone cycle WITH hair, then they were shaved (with time to recover I imagine) and then they tried again. I say &#x27;obviously&#x27; because this little participants is not enough because you&#x27;d need more people to be able to compare means in performance differences.<p>The problem I see however is that after being shaved the participant would feel faster and thus behave faster. A sort of placebo effect if you will. At the same time, the cyclist-cultural effect of being &#x27;unshaved&#x27; in the first test would make them feel sluggish. The same effect as seen in experiments where participants are presented with negative messages vs positive messages and asked to perform tasks. The participants exposed to negative messages, as expected, perform poorly in comparison to the other group.<p>In conclusion, I feel, that this &#x27;research&#x27; can only be used as something to base you hypothesis on, but it is in no way conclusive in its current setup. You&#x27;d need to have random groups of cyclists, some of whom are, to begin with, shaved, and some who are not. It would maybe be easier not to use cyclists in order to find a diverse enough set of participants. Then again I don&#x27;t know how many regular cyclists go around unshaven.",1410246776

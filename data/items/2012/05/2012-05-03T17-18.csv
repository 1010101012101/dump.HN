By accepting a lower salary that simply covers a comfortable style of living you're simply putting even more money in the owner's pocket instead of yours.<p>It's a classic case of pareto optimality. The only explanation I can think of is that many developers don't see themselves as professionals commanding the salaries of professionals as skerrit_bwoy pointed out. There is no reason that good developer in any market shouldn't be living at the exact same standard of living as the good doctors, lawyers, finance people in that market. They should be living in the same homes and sending their kids to the same schools, etc.",1336067953

Seemingly quite stable w/ plenty of nice UI eye-candy.  Only criticism is that it hides a bit of the default customisation settings stuff from the last time I used Ubuntu (last LTS), however, it's definitely a nice push forward for the linux community (in so far as perhaps drumming up new open source users).

Compared to today's game titles it looked very simple but the responsiveness of the machine to the mouse while moving the craft was just amazing. People from all over town came around just to play with it. At that time a typical game that included '3D' would render hidden line removed wire frames at best. Contrast that with Lander displaying filled and shaded quads to generated the landscape, small polygons used to depict smoke and fire and other goodies. There were some short-cuts taken to be able to do the 3D transformations fast enough (for instance, only two directions to move in with a fixed camera angle, 'third person' viewpoint) but whatever the details Lander was a huge step in gaming and worked very well to show off the power of the ARM, even though the game that eventually got released based on that demo was disappointing (it was called virus).",1336067595

contact: dustin@hockeyfollower.com
The Company
Hockey Follower is a web application that combines a social network for competitive hockey players with an unparalleled aggregation of statistics from hockey leagues around the world.  In a model similar to LinkedIn, players, coaches, and scouts can communicate and track statistics on the private side, and fans can follow and interact with players on the public side. 
Founder Dustin Sproat recognized the need for better statistics and communications within the hockey community while managing Hockey Players for Kids (HP4K), a successful charity engaging over 70 pro hockey players with kids in their communities. The Hockey Follower site will feature game statistics, an interactive charitable application, and the hottest news, blogs, videos, and twitter postings about the players.  Amateurs can get noticed by scouts, and pros are  able to brand themselves by using simple applications that make it easy to interact with fans.  Once proof of concept in hockey is realized, a rapid expansion into other sports with similar cultures will ensue.<p>The Position  Technical Cofounder (CTO)
We are shifting our development from being outsourced to being done internally.  The CTO would manage this transition and all technical components of the business.  This Full-Time role would require:
	The ability to program virtually any portion of this database-centric social media platform
	Project management and vision in creating a strong technical architecture 
	Daily management of internal staff, consulting support, and any outsourcing requirements
	Interaction and integration with the business development side of the company
	Use of traffic analytics to direct feature set, online marketing, and SEO
Candidate Profile
The ideal candidate would live in Vancouver, have a BSc in Computing Science, and have 3  5 years of related work experience. Skills, competencies, and passions would include: 
	A desire to work very hard in an exciting, high risk-reward startup environment
	Ability to self-start, lead projects, and manage teams
	Experience with DBMS database management software and social media 
	A passion for sports  particularly hockey  and knowledge of related statistics
	Proficiency with at least some of the following: MySQL, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby on Rails, Python, iOS, Objective C, Amazon EC2
	Should be an open source contributor, please share Gitub projects 
Compensation
The technical cofounder and CTO will be granted a major equity stake in the company, and this would comprise the main form of compensation.  A cost-of-living salary in lieu of some equity would be negotiable.
Please apply with resume and links to online projects:

However, there is a more interesting truth hidden in there.<p>People talk. Not really too surprising but Silicon Valley, like Hollywood, or Washington D.C., or any community being warped by a common theme, is at its heart people. And I don't know it if it part of our genetic heritage or what, but many people love to talk about other people, and so there is the undercurrent of a social fabric (made more visible by LinkedIn or Facebook but its the same fabric).<p>What Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and Washington DC share is a very low viscosity when it comes to job change. People move around, some move around a lot, and so the stories of people, and opinions about people, move with them.<p>Finally there is an external valuation that gets applied to folks, that is part who they are, what they are doing, what they have done, and who they have helped or hindered.<p>This isn't rocket science, but its good to be aware of it if you're working here, or thinking of working here because it can and does affect how you experience things.<p>So a new college graduate goes to work for a company. They come to know the people around them, and may develop opinions about their relative value to the company. After a few years they move on. The next company is looking for help and they ask you to 'reach out to your network' meaning ""Let's see if we can poach the 'good' people from your previous job."" This cycle repeats ad-infinitum.<p>Within that repeating cycle you will discover a truth which I learned from Bob Lyon at Sun which is this ""There are no bad employees, only bad fits"" which you may or may not believe, but it is true, that people who perform poorly in one environment can be superstars in another. And the flip side is ""There are no good employees, only good fits."" which is a scarier thing. At some point you will experience hiring some person who was a superstar at X and they join your company/group and don't get anything done.<p>Over time, and we're talking decades, you find people who are good to very good in most environments, and those who are poor to very poor in most environments. The latter tend to move on (either out of the valley or into different roles), the former become 'targets' for being recruited.<p>The interesting aspect though is that someone has done well in a wide variety of roles, that usually means there are lots of people who know them from interacting with them. Further they often know others who are good in a wide variety of roles. Sometimes it seems like there is a secret society somewhere, but there isn't.<p>When you encounter this phenomena for the first time, you might feel like they are a secret guild, folks who know the other 'good' people who can get things done. And yes, they can demand, and get, a higher than nominal salary (see today's front page story on 'pay'). But that comes from the probability they will do well, regardless of their role.<p>Three things to take away from this:<p>1) If you think your co-worker is a 'loser' consider they may just be in a bad role, if your managing them put them into a different role to see if they are better.<p>2) Track records can only be created over time, so don't worry that you're not 'a superstar' in 3, 5, even 10 years. Get to know people, try different things, test your own boundaries.<p>3) Recommendations and criticisms of someone by a former co-worker who has only seen the subject in one role, can be misleading. It only tells you about them in that one role. If several people have worked with a candidate in different roles and you are getting feedback that is both 'great' and 'skip this one' consider the roles at the time and weight based on your proposed role.",1336065786

When we asked how he implemented past projects, his answers were really vague.  We got suspicious and dropped down to a simple problem like, ""write a loop to print the numbers from one to ten.""<p>The guy was writing some really weird stuff.  When asked to explain, he confidently told us that in C++, every time you reference the iterator variable inside the loop, it gets increased.  His solution was something like:<p><pre><code>    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
    {
        printf(""%d\n"", i);   // <== i gets incremented!
        i--;  // need to compensate for the extra increment!
    }

(except I'm pretty sure he didn't get printf right)<p>So, yeah, I see FizzBuzz as a <i>wonderful</i> way to weed out the incompetent right away, allowing you to focus on deciding whether you need capable or exceptional.<p>Incidentally, one of the guys on my senior project team in college didn't understand how variable assignment worked.

If the median income for an area is $28k vs. $50k, they're simply not able to afford legal services that cost twice the market.  This might mean that lawyers in rural areas only work half as much at the same rate, but that means that without some clever accounting, their yearly income is still (approximately) halved.<p>I'm not saying that no such positions exist, but I know that doctors, lawyers and the like ARE subject to cost of living variance.

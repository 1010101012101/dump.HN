""Hey PG, we know you're busy funding startups and stuff, but we're mildly inconvenienced by some UX decisions you've made with that experimental site you run on the side, and were hoping that you could take the time to implement these seemingly-minor features that've been discussed on HN for years.

The CIA (led by Gary Schroen, who wrote about his mission in First In <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/First-Insiders-Account-Spearheaded-Afghanistan/dp/0345496612"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/First-Insiders-Account-Spearheaded-Afg...</a>) and 2 ODAs, combined with air power and some ground controllers, essentially accomplished all of the world's critical policy objectives before the end of 2001.<p>The primary security risk from Afghanistan is our presence there, exposing forces to attack.  The secondary risk is corruption and terrorist groups funded directly or indirectly by us or enemies funding due to our presence there.  There is essentially no external threat from Afghanistan, even to Pakistan, and there hasn't been since 2002.<p>I think in retrospect, one of the greatest faults with the Obama presidency was deciding to ""double down"" in Afghanistan in 2009, rather than an accelerated withdrawal.  It's hard to believe Obama actually wanted to remain there, so it's primarily that he didn't feel strongly either way and relied on the advice of others, for either domestic-political or military reasons.",1362448651

And, under Windows, a dual 200 MHz machine was much smoother than a single 400 MHz one.<p>The same goes for 64-bit machines. On the Unix side of the fence (which was also the RISC side), 64 bits were useful mostly for the extra memory. Having more than 4 gigs of RAM was outrageous until relatively recent times and the demand for larger address spaces was somewhat smaller than the one for more processing power but, again, it wasn't until Windows XP started supporting them that AMD64 processors became common.

I've found there's no easy way to do this with most drawing/note taking apps on the iPad because you're restricted by the imprecision of your fingers when drawing. I've resorted to pad and pencil.<p>Therefore, the most important aspects for me are:
- zoomable
- ability to draw anywhere
- ability to add a text note anywhere
- neatening up (ie shape recognition) is a nice to have<p>So, feedback for your app:<p>- Zooming position - I expect the zooming to be centered on the midpoint between my touches rather than the top left of the screen/canvas.<p>- Zooming levels - I really want an infinite canvas...<p>- Line width - can there be a mode/setting where the line is the same width no matter the zoom level?<p>- Moving the canvas around - there needs to be some work on the gesture for doing this - after zooming in or out I found myself trying to use one finger to move the canvas and it of course drew a line. I know this is a really difficult problem! (I'm working on an iPad app myself with these kinds of UI problems). Perhaps, after zooming, switch modes to a move canvas mode and the user has to tap on the pencil icon to go back to drawing mode.<p>Anyway, keep up the good work and let me know if you want me to beta test.",1362446886

Just a fantastic job.<p>But the search box, it requires educating the user, and this is your initial and most important functionality on your site.  The funny thing is, you allow your user to type in the search as if they are speaking to a person which is a great idea and obviously the way it should be, but that is not how users have been trained to interact with random websites.  I am sure you are aware of this, I am sure the search box is very important to you, but I think you should revisit the search box and homepage.<p>Here are some ideas, feel free to love them, hate them, praise them, trash them.  I hope they are good and if not I hope they give you some new ideas.<p>* Home page - plain white & bare, logo centered, add airplane or luggage to logo so you don't need to describe what you are offering, text ""Where do you want to go?"", text box, and nothing else.  (Format it like google and people will be more inclined to use it like google)<p>* Automatically figure out where they are coming from. Google analytics knows already, so I am sure there is some way to grab that info. Assume this is their starting point until they tell you otherwise. It currently is defaulting to LA.<p>* The first question anyone answers when traveling somewhere is ""Where"", thus the only text on your page asks, ""Where do you want to go?"".<p>* As the user types in his destination / search, the website immediately responds informatively and aesthetically.<p>* Once you have matched a destination, the background of the page changes to a beautiful image of that location, the vacation doesn't start once you get off the plane, it starts now.  Going from plain white bkgd to a destination image bkgd ideally will slowly start to pull your user into a vacation mind set.<p>* Once you have matched a destination, the text on the homepage changes from ""Where do you want to go?"" to ""When? You could type next week, or 03/22"".<p>* If the user deleted the destination before entering ""When"", repopulate the input field with both the destination and when they want to travel text, he will now understand that you just keep entering information into the field as if you are talking to a person, or searching on google.<p>* Once you have matched when, introduce new imagery of activities you can do there and/or native food dishes.  You are continuing the theme of providing your user with an vacation experience now, not later.<p>* Once you have matched when, the text on the homepage changes from ""When? You could type next week, or 03/22"" to ""For how long? You could type a few days, or a weekend""<p>* After you have all needed search data, proceed to results, and if possible continue vacation now theme<p>* The search box should still work as originally intended as well.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>Keep up the good fight, don't let them leave the home page without thinking ""This is cool!"", and I would love to one day hear people say ""I need to adioso!""",1362446577

I mean, how necessary of a drug does it seem to be -- or, to put it another way, how bad are the withdrawals, compared to antipsychotics, painkillers, etc?""<p>I'm 36 and I've been taking Adderall approximately since I was 32. So I've lived most of my life without it.<p>I've never smoked and I've never been on antidepressants or any other psychiatric drugs so I have a limited number of reference points as far as addiction/withdrawal goes. I <i>have</i> had an off-again, on-again caffeine addiction. In my experience, Adderall is significantly less addictive than caffeine.<p>Quitting Adderall is easy in my experience. I take less on the weekends, and on several occasions I've had no problems tapering my Adderall dosage down to zero over the course of 3-4 days just so I could do a little ""reality check"" and see for myself if I'm truly better off while taking it.<p>Adderall is not a medication that really lends itself to abuse in the sense that you want to cram mouthfuls of it into your body or anything.<p>In some ways, Adderall is very comparable to caffeine -- the first few times you take it, you feel a bit of a rush, but your body acclimates to it rather quickly and you stop feeling it. Unlike caffeine, you don't typically get the same sort of ""crash"" an hour later.<p>Though I have pretty poor impulse control at times, I've had no problem moderating Adderall usage. My psychiatrist, after a year or two of developing trust in me, actually prescribes me twice the dosage I need (30mg daily instead of 15mg daily) because he knows it will last me twice as long and therefore I can save myself some insurance co-pays for office visits.  :)<p>I've never been on antidepressants but I've watched friends struggle with getting <i>off</i> of antidepressants, and I've also seen what they're like after missing a few doses. They have found themselves in <i>really</i> rough shape unless they carefully taper their dosages down over the course of weeks or even months. From those secondhand observations, I feel Adderall is not even close to being in that league when it comes to withdrawal.<p>""And if you've lived with Adderall usage, do you chronically feel like you have a reduced appetite and all the other kinds of symptoms?""<p>It hasn't affected my appetite much. (I kind of wish it had!) The main negative side effect is that Adderall makes me more high-strung. However, falling behind on one's obligations due to untreated ADHD can also negatively one's mood, to say the very least.<p>edit: grammar/spelling/formatting",1362445440

Donna made me feel pretty welcome and off I went on tour with them.<p>During the tour I started a fanzine to make money and help keep me alive. That fanzine was assisted by her (providing material) and I sold it to the fans.<p>The bit where it became more was after the tour had finished. How now to find money for food? I still had the fanzine but Elastica were on the cover and Elastica were not playing. I removed the cover, and would make a new cover according to whoever was in town headlining that night. Having the band on the cover is the difference between selling 20 copies and selling 150 copies.<p>Something about that first transformation from being on the streets to earning a decent wage off my own back has pretty much influenced every action since: I won't go back to the street, and there are always new ways to approach existing problems.<p>I could cite many more that are related to what we do, are more recent, are more obvious, etc... but none provided an epiphany greater than that first one.",1256557412
902986,comment,902541,902874,0,0,twp,,,"I was a long term ion user and contributed code over several years to the project before switching to xmonad.<p>As I remember it, with ion you basically created your own layout manually.  You'd make horizontal or vertical splits to divide up your workspace and then manually move windows around in to the resulting frames.  It worked brilliantly: with a few keystrokes you could get exactly the windows you wanted in the order you wanted.<p>xmonad manages the layout for you, you don't have to do it manually.  This means that when you create a new window xmonad automatically creates a new frame for it.  To contrast, ion would add the window as a new tab of the current frame.  If you wanted a new frame in ion then you'd have to create it.<p>The automatic layouts of xmonad are what make it so interesting, but you do need to spend some time getting them set up for the way you work.  xmonad is without a doubt the most customisable window manager ever (which is both a blessing and a curse).<p>xmonad also works much better with other software than ion.  This is a reflection of the developers behind each window manager.  The ion developer had very strong opinions about everything and told anything he didn't like (like anti-aliased fonts, automake, GNOME, etc.) to f'ck off.  The xmonad team are super-friendly and play well with others.  xmonad has great GNOME support, for example.<p>I think I still prefer ion's way of working, but I strongly suspect that it's possible to duplicate it in xmonad, I just haven't done it yet.  Maybe now that 0.9 is out I'll review my xmonad configuration.",1256557389

902976,comment,902899,902923,0,0,BobbyH,,,"Your take sounds plausible, but there are several conceptual inaccuracies:<p>1. Financial derivatives have no relationship to derivatives in calculus. (The two concepts are just coincidental namesakes.) A financial derivative is called a ""derivative"" because the price of a financial derivatives is _derived_ from the price of an underlying something. However, the price of the underlying asset is just one of many inputs into the price of a derivative on that option, so nobody is taking a ""first derivative with respect to price"".<p>2. It would be impossible to make a billion dollar bet on a penny stock using ""plain vanilla"" (regular) derivatives like options, because stock options are not offered on thinly traded penny stocks (because nobody cares about the stock, so nobody will care about the stock option, so an exchange won't invest in offering that stock option). The only way you could make a billion dollar bet on a penny stock is if you found an large institution or billionaire to make a customized bet with you about that stock (or a coin toss). However, there is almost no liquidity for a non-exchange-traded option of this kind.<p>3. A stock option and its underlying stock have an intimate relationship. An options trader will often buy or short a stock to hedge the risk s/he has from owning the stock option (and vice versa). An options/derivative trader definitely has to worry about how ""unwinding a position"" in one market will affect the other market.",1256556934

This is an external marker, something other people judge you by and you can advertise with. When you have to solve actual problems, it's no good to think of yourself as smart and experienced, because that will only frustrate you if your amazing talents don't immediately suggest a solution. Taking yourself out of the equation and treating each problem by its own merits rather than your own merits is what's required, and that's the point of the ""lazy"" and ""dumb"" epithets: they're a deliberate kick to your ego, something programmers can usually use less of.

If there is a market, a demand, and a willing supply then there should be little or nothing to stop the flow of labour. The EU for example in the 90s was worried about the entrance of Polish and Greek labour onto their market. The experiment turned out to be successful. Where, in the UK, there was much higher competition for plumbers, an example. Before, if you had a problem you would pay through the nose to get a plumber*. Now, the work is much more sanely priced.<p>Now that the UK economy has tanked the same Polish migrants are heading home or to other areas of the EU. Obviously, some have decided to stay in the UK. But a lot have gone to Poland to start a business in their home country because now their is demand and money available. If the immigration rules were restrictive than most would be reluctant to leave because you're either in or out.<p>Immigration should be a simple process; a bit of paperwork and a background check.

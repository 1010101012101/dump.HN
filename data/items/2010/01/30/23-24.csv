1089573,comment,1089479,1089479,0,0,archgrove,,,"Well, the browser has tabs (at least, the iPhone Mobile Safari does, so it's no stretch to think this does as well). The lack of a camera is, I agree, silly.<p>Rather than rebut the rest of his ""points"" directly, I'll focus on ""multitasking"". Frankly, the iPhone and iPad <i>do</i> multitask, in the ways that are important to (most) people. Multitasking in an end user product really means ""I can do more than one thing at once"", not ""The computer runs many processes"". The iPhone OS currently accomplishes exactly this, via saved state.<p>In any well behaved iPhone app, if you quit, the state of the UI and your data is persisted, so that when you return, it's like you never left. The UI for this multitasking is a bit clunky - hit ""Home"" then pick the app - but for most people, this works fine. There are only two situations when this doesn't - when the app does something interesting in the background, and when the ""stack"" of application interactions collapses - if I click a mailto: link to open Mail, quitting that doesn't return me to Safari - I have to go there again manually.<p>The two cases of ""Does something interesting in the background"" that really people want are audio streaming and notification of some event, and they're real problems. However, Apple's persistently said they're trying to protect the user experience (stability, battery life etc) by denying background apps. I've no reason to believe this isn't the case (I'm mean really, what are they gaining except geek ire by restricting this?). The audio case is annoying and needs a solution - the notification case is slightly better since push was rolled out.<p>Outside of these cases, the iPhone multitasks well enough for 99% of the world. His reading case, catching up on the news etc all are handled - you just have a slightly painful app switch process (i.e. you press two buttons rather than just one). The only case that isn't is background movies/music from 3rd party apps - and really, the only sensible case out of that is music (Do you really watch a movie <i>and</i> browse at the same time on a 10"" screen?). Regardless, I suspect the point will be moot soon enough - OS 4.0 seems very likely to bring some notion of background processes.<p>The geek anti-iPad ire really confuses me. What did we expect, other than what we got? It was <i>never</i> going to run OS X - the user experience would have been awful without major changes that broke all 3rd party OS X apps (and then, what's the  point?). The hardware, modulo camera, seems entirely reasonable at a price that's damn good - who realistically expected anything more from an affordable tablet machine at this point in technology? The ""walled garden"" is a real issue, but I think we have, as a group, gained far more than we've lost with the App store. All these people saying ""I could never have been a tinkerer with an iPad"" - poppycock. Download the SDK for free, develop all you want. Pay a nominal fee to deploy to 100 other devices without ever giving Apple a look at your app. Or hell, just jailbreak it if the limits of the SDK are so onerous.<p>Alternatively, just don't buy it. Having chosen this please, stop filling up HN/Reddit/The Internet with ""The iPad doesn't raise the dead, make me a billionaire and cure cancer, so all my dreams are shattered and Apple is awful"".",1264895865

I just switched from php to python about 3 weeks ago in order to deploy apps on the Google App Engine. My deepest language experience is in frontend Actionscript 3, so Python feels very similar to that in that you have imports, packages, and modules. I do still find myself typing "";"" on rare occasions to end lines.<p>Here are a few things that I got tripped up by:<p>- I was searching for a substr? function. there is none; instead you do things like str[0:1]<p>- <i>Dont Count on autocompletion (at least not in eclipse)</i>. I was hoping I could duck type things like i had done in php Eclipse and get object info autocompleted. This is not possible, so you have to keep a lot more info about objects in your head. Perhaps one way around this is to try keep all your classes in one module.<p>- <i>Test with IDLE</i>. I was used to testing php code by whipping up a single page and browsing to localhost. With appengine, and possibly your web server, this isn't justifiable when Python ships with a pretty cool cmd IDE.<p>hth!",1264895715

Of course, it seems to me that all the controversy is warranted: I subscribe to the theory that the problem is with the software that controls the engine and transmission.<p>This is because of my own experience with a Camry that shifts at the wrong times and has unpredictable acceleration or lack of acceleration. Several months after we bought the car (a 2007) we were able to get a firmware upgrade that improved the performance somewhat, but at the cost of gas mileage. Since the car doesn't perform as well as it should (it's nowhere near as responsive or efficient as our '97 Camry was), it seems like the underlying problems still haven't been fixed.<p>Toyota has offered two other ""solutions"" for their problems, but neither rings true, and as the LA Times points out, neither can explain all the reported incidents. If Toyota were covering up their inability to find and fix the real problem, this is what it would look like.

You can literally order and have a coffee in the time it takes you to pay (one person is on the cash, the other is making your order by overhearing). Today the store close to me made over 300 breakfast sandwiches (bagel/tea biscuit, bacon/sausage/egg or any combination) in 4 hours.<p>Including redundancies in your order causes complications and the ability to induce error. Why this isn't simple to understand for so many people here, I don't know.<p>Coffee here in Canada is <i>always</i> served black. Stating 'no cream' or 'no sugar' sounds like 'one cream' or 'one sugar' to the person making the drink (note: <i>NOT</i> the person you ordered from). The person making drinks can have to deal with upwards of 100 coffees during a 10-minute rush, this means less than 6 seconds per coffee. When they get a pre-work rush at 6am, and the staff serving you have been working since 10PM, there's no chance in hell they'll spend 6 seconds listening to you order your coffee when it takes them that long to make it. That 10-minute rush will be backlogged to taking 20 minutes.<p>I'm not even discussing the people that order like that through a crackly 10-year-old drive-thru intercom and expect their order to be interpreted properly.<p>Perhaps it's an American thing that orders take needlessly long to be served and are needlessly complicated. I can't order a drink at Starbucks without being forced through an impossible discussion, or listing off a grocery list. Similar happens at McDonalds here in Canada, a simple 2-item order can take a solid 10 minutes to be dealt with.

When iPhone first came out, developers found out that their apps were completely shut down by the OS when they switched away, so they imagined their apps working the same way as they would on a desktop OS when they get closed and reopened: back to the ""main menu"". There's no reason that has to be the case, though, if developers just persist the relevant bits of the user's state when they switch away then restore it gracefully.<p>* in general; if memory is running low, Safari will ""forget"" everything about other pages, so if you were writing something substantial, it'd be best to remember to Select All + Copy before switching away.

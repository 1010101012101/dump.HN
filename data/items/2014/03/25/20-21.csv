7468928,comment,7468153,7468153,1,0,rafweverbergh,,,"&quot;However, I think this market is in the wrong direction of technology. In pure software, marginal cost of a new unit is zero, while of course for each new Louis Vuitton bag or each new Rolex, there’s costs for material and craftsmanship. But projecting forward into a world with ubiquitous, sophisticated 3D printing, the value of material and craftsmanship attenuate.&quot;<p>What luxury goods sell (art, handmade Rolls,...) is a <i>story</i>, not a product. The category that looks more likely to suffer are the luxury goods that are merely almost-luxury products - industrially manufactured but high priced (I&#x27;m thinking Nespresso here). What will hurt them is the increased transparency - the cold spotlight on their industrial value chain. They will be exposed as fakes.<p>But what will likely thrive is everything that has nothing to hide but everything to gain from this new transparency - everything that is ugly, earthy, hand made, at the expense of sweat and blood and occasionally the lunacy of the artist or artisan. That stuff will probably become astronomically expensive.<p>And then, someone will figure out how to produce that semi-industrially and we can start over again ;)",1395781158

Dynamic typing is fun for the simpler cases, but as soon as you go into trickier computations like crunching analytics data, you continuously run into run-time type mismatches that take forever to correctly pinpoint. Also having to continuously keep in your head just what exactly you&#x27;re threading through functions is a pain and requires a lot of mental overhead.<p>The JVM also doesn&#x27;t seem to bring much of a benefit to the table, considering that we only ever deploy onto 64bit Ubuntu 12.04, so there&#x27;s not really a big need for portability.<p>The best part has been how fun it is to work in clojure and the community around #clojure channel with so many of its freakishly smart people.

7468894,comment,7465036,7468526,2,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"First, I explicitly was not talking about sending patches, but about pull requests. You can actually write an email that says &quot;please pull from git://foo.example/project topic-bar&quot; or whatever, that is something quite different from sending mails with patches inside.<p>Second, this is not in any way about github necessarily doing something wrong, but about its users doing something wrong in making it into a central quasi-monopoly. If you do offer non-proprietary ways for submitting patches, that probably goes a long way - but the way github is used by its userbase (that is, people just assume you have a github account, and don&#x27;t invest in non-centralized solutions anymore because github is so easy, ...) leads to there being projects that don&#x27;t have that option anymore, so I actually can not contribute, and in that way, github does get in the way.<p>The problem is not so much the individual who happens to be hosting some project on github, the problem is the centralization and monopolization that happens when too many people do that.<p>Also, yes, I do understand the individual motivation for using github, because it has some short-term advantages, but you maybe should not ignore the long-term consequences. The problem is that github&#x27;s UI being more convenient does not technically depend on github&#x27;s centralization (technically, github is completely unnecessary for solving the problem), but it is what github uses to build its monopoly. Let me sketch out a technically different solution that would be equally convenient with no risk of monopoly abuse: How about we define a machine-readable open format for pull requests, assign it a MIME type, and then just have git itself or some local git UI (of which there obviously could be multiple different ones, open ones as well as closed ones) registered for handling that MIME type on your system. Suddenly, you could simply use your existing mail account in order to send such a machine readable pull request via email to anyone at any other mail provider (probably with a single git command or UI mouse click?), and they could with a single keypress/click in the mail client start processing/reviewing the pull request. People could host their repos whereever they want, including on their own server, and among the providers possibly could be github, but there would be no risk of monopolization, everyone could use their preferred UI, their preferred git hoster, their preferred mail provider, ..., without that being a hurdle in any way whatsoever. Now, one reason why that does not get developed, I would suggest, is because &quot;github is so convenient&quot;.<p>My point is: There is nothing wrong with making things more convenient, but it would be a good idea to think about ways to make things more convenient _without_ building monopolies, if only because those tend to be highly inconvenient in the long run.",1395780853

Sexual relationships with minors are illegal because in many/most cases they involve an unhealthy power dynamic.  Now there are exceptions (and the rules are pretty arbitrary in that a 17/18 year old couple is a completely different thing than a 15/30 year old couple).  But on the whole this is good and important.<p>Now I could be completely off on my understanding of polygamy in practice.  But I have a lot more information about what LGBT relationships are like in real life and therefore feel far more conviction that they are healthy and should be fully accepted.  Show me people in healthy polygamous relationships who want to see them state-recognized and I am open to changing my mind.<p>The &quot;healthyness&quot; of them is important, not only to protect vulnerable people from unhealthy power dynamics, but because if legalized, the state would need to become involved in all sorts of questions like what happens when a polygamous marriage is dissolved.  What if just one person leaves?  How does custody/property work in all of these cases?  What if there are disagreements about power of attorney among remaining spouses when one spouse is in the hospital?  The legal aspects of marriage get complicated quickly when there are more than two participants.  Unless society has a good understanding of what these polygamous relationships mean and how they function, it would be pretty hard for the courts to decide what is &quot;fair&quot; in these difficult cases.<p>These are the reasons I don&#x27;t think you can reason about this in a logical vacuum.  You can&#x27;t just extrapolate and say &quot;well if you can marry one man, the stat is being unjust if you can&#x27;t also marry two.&quot;  Life and laws aren&#x27;t a logic puzzle.

You may not hear about it because generally these founders&#x27; startups are either not yet well known, don&#x27;t end up making it or they don&#x27;t share this information until later. It&#x27;s not always desirable to share that you&#x27;re sleeping in your car or making sacrifices others may deem unhealthy or unsustainable.

7468725,comment,7467721,7468464,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"I agree. The problems with your point about taxing the workers start at the asymptotes:<p>150 million workers have relatively little income compared to the top 1% who obtain a very large share of the income. They also have a lot more &quot;tax events&quot; and derive them not from wages but from capital gains.<p>We currently have 150 million workers and a middle class. Unemployment is going to have to be embraced when one janitor can clean 100,000 sqft building using a few very efficient machines, or a dozen workers can run a car manufacturing facility that produces a new vehicle every 3 seconds. At this level of productivity, which we are going to approach, the form of capitalism that assumes that those unemployed are a fringe group of people between jobs is not going to work. A new system is going to need to be developed, unless population is going to decrease at the same rate as productivity increases.<p>So the solutions as I see them are:<p>1. Make the government more productive so the tax wouldn&#x27;t have to be quite so high. The government uses money in two ways: to run its internal services and to re-distribute the money. The former should be streamlined (making the IRS simple would be along those lines), while the latter can be reigned in by cutting spending to less needed services (e.g.: excessive military spending, tax loop holes, etc.)<p>2. Make the sales tax progressive by the type of item being sold. This goes hand in hand with your third point and can get complex, but the states already do this: food, clothing, and everything else are all taxed differently. Let&#x27;s have a 50% tax on tobacco, and a 0.1% tax on food. Note that this is still more efficient than reviewing every single person&#x27;s return and looking for exceptions.<p>3. Since the tax is national, there will be less problems than with the state tax in terms of determining where you have presence. Just charge the tax and that&#x27;s it.<p>4. Issuing a refund at the end of the year does a person no good if throughout the year they cannot afford to buy food and shelter. To fix this, we need a minimum wage that actually lets someone support themselves. The amount should be re-evaluated yearly or if inflation jumps more than a regular percentage, and should rise with at least inflation. As we approach the productivity asymptote, basic income is going to need to be implemented as well.",1395779346

Way more. And I am not just talking about the fact that they might leave mid-project or have a moral hazard of screwing up a project knowing they&#x27;ll have their next job to fail upwards into. But something even more basic.<p>For example if I have to pay the cost of 1-5 once every 3 years, that&#x27;s 3 times less than if I have to pay it every year. So will I bear the full cost of 1-5 every time or pass it on to the employees I hire into that position? Of course I would pass it on, and moreover I can justify it by saying that they don&#x27;t have &quot;seniority within the organization&quot; or that we are a meritocracy.<p>So you are completely neglecting this side of the phenomena, and blindly claiming that salaries will go up because poaching increases.

It&#x27;s easy to look at companies like Snapchat, but most startups will not become so popular that they can obtain the type of funding that allows them to significantly delay the implementation of a revenue strategy. Monetizing a modestly popular consumer property that can support more than a handful of employees is still very, very difficult.<p>In the B2B market, creating a successful business requires that you build something people want (or, more preferably, need), that you can sell and sell at a profit, and in sufficient volume. B2B sales can be difficult and slow, even if you have a great sales team and a great product, and the cost of sale can be much higher than you anticipate. If you do crack the sales puzzle in a profitable manner, scaling sales to the point at which you actually have a real business is a hurdle many startups never get past.<p>If you look beyond the top 1% startups, you&#x27;ll quickly find that Silicon Valley is littered with stagnant startups that are based on seemingly good ideas and that might even elicit comments like &quot;I would use that!&quot; But they&#x27;re not &quot;wanted&quot; enough to get from <i>great idea</i> to <i>great business</i>.<p>None of this means creating a company is a bad idea, but starting the journey with the &quot;build something people want&quot; mantra in mind, and little else, is more often than not a path to disappointment than success.",1395778230

The state I grew up in has a long list of poor people exemptions by industry.  Everything in the grocery store except hot deli food is tax free, for example.  Tuition, medical care, bunch of other poor people things all tax free...  As a poor person the only taxes you&#x27;ll likely ever pay are the 100% or so gasoline sin tax and sales tax on a car.  5% depreciation on a new car is a fraction of driving it off the lot, and for used, especially for poor people, there&#x27;s a wink and nod that if you&#x27;re not involving a bank just don&#x27;t submit anything completely ridiculous, and they don&#x27;t enforce sales tax at all on family sales because they know we&#x27;d just avoid it via gift tax if they cracked down and other than divorce situations you&#x27;ll never get family members testifying against each other.<p>Its important to keep the tax rate reasonably low compared to the &quot;real world poor folks&quot; inflation rate (not the made up one).  Another way to think about it, is I live in a civilized (non-california) area and our cost of living is much lower.  So you can express our 5% sales tax as living about 18 months in the future, or as living about 1/20th more like Californians.  Its just not a big deal.<p>Now if you want a euro style 50% then the big problem isn&#x27;t so much the poor as all the people trying to evade that kind of tax rate.

Pussy-licking finger-fucking ho-ass cunt.<p>And then he smiles as if it&#x27;s his fifth birthday.

The only thing that is banned are the Nazi party symbols and the general patterns connected with it (Holocaust-denialism, preaching against a minority, that sort of thing) and it has been an effective tool to counter any resurgence of &quot;The Nazis 2&quot;.<p>Because, as most non-Germans are most likely unaware, Neo-Nazi groups have been actively trying to gain a foothold in youth culture here for a very long time. I can distinctly remember the knuckleheads that tried to distribute &quot;those&quot; tapes/CDs back in school.<p>Of course having the &quot;illegal&quot; tapes was enough to radicalize some, but they never could organize on any scale, since any organization or music group that attracted too big a following was rapidly banned.<p>Weighing the good and the bad consequences of our German law comes IMO very much out on the positive side.

E.g. if you try &#x27;bento small plate&#x27;, when the answer is &#x27;bento #small plate&#x27;, then there needs to be an explanation as to what you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> do.

They are essentially treating Bitcoin as gold (actually slightly better, since gold has a collectible tax rate of 28% which doesn&#x27;t qualify for the long term capital gains rate). The trickiest and scariest consequence will be for miners, who might need to report taxes at the time their bitcoins were mined and at the current market rate. This will mean a lot of people will need to retroactively declare gains, many of which may not have been realized. For small mining operations likely the miners will avoid reporting and just sell for cash. But for large miners who will need to use the exchanges, this becomes a real issue.

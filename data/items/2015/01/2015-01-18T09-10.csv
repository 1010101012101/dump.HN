I mean, we both ate like pigs at the time, and I wasn’t surprised that Ben had to let one go, but man...what a doozy.” Ben and Jacob left the breakout room early; they feared a hazmat team was required to make the room usable again. But they couldn’t stop listening to the video as they walked back to Jacob’s apartment. Jacob remembered his epiphany; he didn’t think much of it then. “I didn’t like having to pull out my Flip cam to listen to it over and over again, when I had my iPhone right there. It deserved to be more convenient.” As soon as they returned to Jacob’s apartment, he built a (aptly described) “quick and dirty” iPhone app that could serve his purposes. All the app displayed was a big red button and the word “FART!” underneath it. Satisfied that it functioned as expected, Ben spent some time prettying up the button, and installed it on his own phone. The novelty refused to disappear as they pressed the button over and over again; the staying power of Ben’s indigestion was unprecedented.",1421575042

I was just about to go sleep when I noticed a retweet and a lot of new stars on Conception; this explains it.<p>The linked C++ project was the result of an initial year of working on it, which culminated in a winning entry to LIVE 2013 contest [1] and me switching to working on a version of it written completely in Go [2]. I no longer work actively on the C++ version, but I do on the Go one [3].<p>Primarily, it has been an extremely insightful learning experience. I had a lot of ideas and I wanted to try them, and by building Conception I found out the reasons why certain things that are commonly desired do not actually work well in practice, and why our seemingly outdated practices of writing code no different than decades ago are still so predominant and effective.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting to go back to my old notes and goals and, with hindsight, truly understand _why_ they didn&#x27;t work out, and what it would take to make them work.<p>The Go version is go-gettable and working [4] despite having lots of dependences (as proven by the green Travis build). This is one of the benefits of using Go and not the case for C++ version. You can easily try it, but at this point the UI is so far from finished, it&#x27;s not really fit for general use. If you&#x27;re interested, I highly recommend watching the repo so you&#x27;ll see further development. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://liveprogramming.github.io/liveblog/2013/04/live-programming-contest-winners/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liveprogramming.github.io/liveblog/2013/04/live-progr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception-go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception-go</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception-go/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception-go/graphs/contributor...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception-go#installation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception-go#installation</a>",1421574521

8907128,comment,8903378,8903825,0,0,oulu2006,,,"Background has been mostly in C/Java and Scala. Scala for the past 3 years. It&#x27;s a fantastically complicated language with even its creator Martin Odersky looking to do a major rethink and turn it into something simpler [1]. I never could finish reading the language standard. There was a lot of effort put into a lot of libraries that just made it harder to use Scala, like Scalaz which pimped almost every standard scala library class. Almost every time I went to use an external library I had to also learn the DSL that came along with it (the popular dispatch library for HTTP requests, &quot;dispatch&quot;, needs a periodic table to decipher how to use it [2]). Then usually after that cognitive load I would encounter the inevitable limitations of the DSL and find no-way out of DSL hell; I went through 4 different DB libraries, trending down from ORM-high, ORM-ligher, ORM-almost nothing to &quot;just some string interpolation around SQL&quot;. Some people find a lot of pleasure in debating language feature X and Y, and at first I cared about that, I really tried, but I was just fooling myself, I didn&#x27;t really.<p>I like Lisp and specifically Clojure, for a number of reasons, with a lot of those reasons being because it&#x27;s the _same_ .....everywhere. I read Clojure code like I read English, I can glance at a piece of Clojure and not wonder why there is an implicit argument that needs to passed and where the compiler might be finding it; the rules for Scala static implicit resolution go in and out even after reading them a few times for me.<p>Clojure has a lot of improvements on CLOS, I&#x27;m not sure how much Clojure experience you&#x27;ve had? There&#x27;s enough differences that some of the arguments I noticed in the paper (which seem to be really just syntactical) on why ruby is an acceptable Lisp don&#x27;t really apply to Clojure. For example, in Clojure you don&#x27;t use lambda, you use &quot;fn&quot; to do the same thing. One of the things I really like about Clojure is that I get to run it on the JVM, which still beats hands down the Ruby VM, AFAIK, I did check a little while ago.<p>I&#x27;m not that familiar with the Python REPL, but Clojure&#x27;s is pretty good and I love being able to jack into production when I have to and modify executing code to do tracing or debugging without having to restart it :) I know, it should never get to that point, but testing only covers so much.<p>Ok, I think I&#x27;ll leave it at that.<p>Another poster on this thread made a comment around, people think in different ways, some people love thinking C++ and classes for everything....I&#x27;m not one of those people, I want to just say exactly what I want to say and nothing else; if I want a class I&#x27;ll make one, else get it out of my way. I think LISP so when I type it&#x27;s an almost 1-1 correspondence.<p>Cheers!<p>p.s. nice work on the Javascript port of arc, I didn&#x27;t know that had been done.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/article/2609013/java/scala-founder--language-due-for--fundamental-rethink-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2609013/java/scala-founder-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.flotsam.nl/dispatch-periodic-table.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flotsam.nl/dispatch-periodic-table.html</a>",1421573927

I am guessing it boils down to preference, but writing code as it is written now involves a lot less &#x27;mouse&#x27; and much more keyboard, which most developers, me included, take for granted. 
I do agree that currently code written has very high limitations on re-usability, primarily because code is written with a specific project in mind. I believe two things can be done to make it more re-usable: 
1) either have all developers write code with the idea in mind that they are writing independent libraries and not code for part of a bigger project so the code becomes much much more modular and decoupled and can be used in other projects on the fly.
2) create an extension which creates a project specific visual map for the code, which would in turn allow other developers to pick and choose code to their liking while having a greater understanding of how the code actually works.
This being said, the author&#x27;s efforts are much commendable.",1421573353

8907093,comment,8904980,8907043,0,0,datashovel,,,"I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say I am certain I have a foolproof answer, otherwise the solution would probably already be apparent.  What I am saying is, certainly, the problem is a difficult one.<p>I think the idea behind &#x27;1984&#x27;, the book, (before I understood what terrorism was) only seemed a flippant idea propositioned as the plot of a fictional book.  Surely no human being would ever consciously choose to govern the world (or their nation) in such a way, and even so they would likely be cut off early in the process if they tried.<p>Now with more life experience and knowledge of the current state of the world, I can only reason that &#x27;1984&#x27; makes complete and total sense once the concept of &quot;terrorism&quot; is understood to be the catalyst of such a movement.<p>Here are some basic scenarios:<p>1)  Terrorism scares citizens and thus, as a knee-jerk reaction, wish to empower their government with omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent powers.  The kinds of powers that any subsequent (corrupt) government could easily take advantage of.<p>2)  Terrorism scares citizens, and as such citizens decide to be proactive to collaborate with their government to help prevent terrorists from causing harm to their nation and to make them as effective as they can possibly be, while at the same time working to preserve basic human rights such as the right to privacy.<p>3)  Terrorism scares citizens.  Knowing that entrusting their government with the kinds of powers they would need in order to act against terrorism would be overreaching, as such citizens decide their government should have no such powers and decide not to give their government God-like powers, while also deciding not to collaborate and blaming all failures on their government, and so citizens continue to live in a world of constant alertness and fear worrying that their next trip to the city could be their last...<p>Just like the Goldilocks fairy tale, I think the world is not looking for a solution that is &quot;too hot&quot; or &quot;too cold&quot;.  Rather we&#x27;re all looking for the solution that is &quot;just right&quot;.  The specific solution I can&#x27;t say I have the answer, but with continuous iteration and improvement I&#x27;m certain smart people can come to a sane (but more than likely imperfect) solution that does not violate any single group and their goals / objectives / rights.  And at the same time does not necessarily handicap future generations with rules and regulations that are almost insurmountable should they find themselves ruled by a corrupt / power-hungry government.",1421572438
8907092,comment,8906684,8907074,0,0,declan,,,"Well, there is no U.S. law requiring key escrow. There are a very few laws that impose escrow-like requirements on some sectors. If you&#x27;re a financial services firm you may be required to monitor employees&#x27; email, which makes some forms of encryption tricky. And even the CALEA excerpt you quoted above authorizes telecom carriers to provide secure end-to-end crypto (they wouldn&#x27;t have &quot;the information necessary to decrypt the communication&quot;). CALEA doesn&#x27;t apply to the tech firms HN knows and loves; they&#x27;re not telecom carriers, a term of art.<p>But putting all that aside for the moment, banning crypto without backdoors would, at a minimum, create real difficulties for U.S. companies and require many open source/free software projects to move overseas. It would also make felons of many HN readers. That&#x27;s no exaggeration; an ex-Mozilla fellow now building the crypton.io framework wrote to me this evening saying: &quot;That bill would have made my work criminal.&quot; <a href=""https://twitter.com/deezthugs/status/556678844120576000"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/deezthugs/status/556678844120576000</a><p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t believe the FBI|NSA|DOJ|DEA|DHS|CIA|etc. cadre of TLAs are pushing for a ban on domestic crypto now. But they tend to take the long view. Look very carefully at what <i>is</i> eventually proposed. Is it a ban on whole-disk encryption without backdoors? Would it extend to PCs? What about open source projects and AOSP? Would mere possession of non-backdoored crypto be a crime, or distribution, or commercial sale? Etc.<p>I view a lot of this as the Feds trying to pressure Apple and Google into adopting an escrowed solution for encrypted devices -- without actually enacting a law. Laws are public, subject to legal challenge (a federal appeals court in the Junger case held there are 1A issues involved in a crypto ban), and tend not to make it through Congress very quickly. But extralegal pressure can be applied in secret, is not subject to legal challenge, and can happen much sooner.<p>HN threads in the past have discussed some of these extralegal pressures that can be brought to bear. Multi-billion dollar .gov contracts are a big one too.",1421572437

Plus, there&#x27;s more to the movie than just assassination - its also a reflection of the condition of the North Korean people, and the constraints placed upon their lives by a repressive regime.  Sometimes all thats needed to push the needle into the red-zone of revolution is a reminder that things are not always as they seem; while I personally think its a stupid movie from a purile industry, my opinion doesn&#x27;t matter here.  The North Korean people have to decide for themselves if they can do something about their dire circumstances, and what to do.. perhaps this movie will plant some hints in someones mind, and something will get done about it.<p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;m no fan of Hollywood being used as a tool for propaganda against us by our own imperial, authoritarian masters, either.. its a double-edged sword..)",1421572320

2745439,comment,2742596,2745240,2,0,aik,,,"I think this study is being misunderstood here. Giftedness in most cases isn't something you either have or 
don't. Often it's a result of a better intellectually stimulating environment when growing up. Students of the same age that grew up in less stimulating environments will naturally be behind in a number of areas due to having less developed (or less extensive) neural structures in the areas of background knowledge, mental models, and other various mental procedures. In a lot of cases I believe these students can catch up, but placing them in even less stimulating environments will not accomplish this, and rather widen the gap.<p>Secondly and in addition, a major part of this study is about the effects various influences have on an individuals' intelligence theories and motivation -- effects of expectations, stereotypes, and also teacher behavior in class. Plenty of studies have shown how various external influences have a massive effect on a students' achievement due to the theory on intelligence they form from these influences.<p>So I agree giving good teachers to everybody is the solution, however there are definitely other environmental factors involved that complicate the issue. For one, breaking up students into gifted/non-gifted categories adds yet another stereotype that could potentially be harmful to both the non-gifted and gifted students.<p>I believe the solution would encompass having teachers that understand how these influences affect students, which will give them the capability to structure their classes and their instruction in such a way to dissipate any damage these influences can make, and instead turn them into catalysts for growth.",1310209123

It is, if anything, at most an distributional fairness issue among the people living at any one point in time.<p>You might worry that in the future, the people won't have the tools at their disposal to fix those distributional fairness issues. However, since a monetarily sovereign government has the ultimate control over the interest rate that it pays on its debts (and the flows of interest payments are what is most relevant), this is not a concern.<p>I realize that this last part is very counter-intuitive if you're used to thinking only in terms of options available to the currency <i>user</i>.

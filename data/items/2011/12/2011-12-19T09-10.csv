This is an all-or-nothing argument that isn't based in reality.  The reality is you make choices at every level, and an ORM like ActiveRecord doesn't do much to prevent you from using the full database feature set at your disposal.  Granted, if you do everything with stored procedures and foreign keys then you won't be able to use all of ActiveRecord's features, but you really can do things any way you want.<p>> <i>then what benefit do you get from using an RDBMS? Wouldn't NoSQL be better?</i><p>Now assuming you lean more in the ActiveRecord direction and don't do much heavy database engineering, why no use NoSQL?  Well, take your pick from the usual reasons.  RDBMS systems are mature, performant, extremely rich for ad-hoc querying and, easy to administer, etc, etc.  Just because ActiveRecord only explicitly uses 20% of the features of the typical RDBMS doesn't mean those features aren't extremely useful per se.<p>The way I look at it is that using an RDBMS for almost any new project is a smart hedge, because an RDBMS is the most type of flexible data store.  It will allow you to pivot more easily compared to a NoSQL store where things may be extremely scalable in the dimension that you foresee, but if you need to pivot your data model you are in for a massive rewrite.  People complain about adding columns and indices to SQL databases vs the ""agility"" of just adding keys to Mongo or whatever, but honestly it's just a little busy work most of the time, it doesn't really hurt until your data gets huge, at which point you are going to be running into unanticipated bottlenecks anyway.",1324288608

If so, the world-renowned university is willing to give you a new kind of credential to prove it.
Not a full-fledged diploma  that's still a possibility only for the 10,000 or so students admitted to its Cambridge, Mass., campus. But on Monday, MIT is announcing that for the first time it will offer credentials  under the name ""MITx""  to students who complete the online version of certain courses, starting with a pilot program this spring.
""This is not MIT light. This is not an easier version of MIT,"" said Provost L. Rafael Reif. ""An MITx learner, anywhere they are, for them to earn a credential they have to demonstrate mastery of the subject just like an MIT student does.""
The announcement comes as elite universities like Stanford, Yale and Carnegie-Mellon are experimenting with how to use the Internet to extend their teaching to a global audience hungering for instruction on platforms like YouTube, Apple's iTunes U and others developed by universities themselves. MIT's OpenCourseWare has been among the most popular, making course materials such as syllabi, tests and lecture videos from over 2,000 MIT classes available free online. The 10-year-old program has been accessed by more than 100 million people worldwide.
But where elite universities like MIT have mostly stopped short is offering some kind of credential that carries the university name and proves the recipient has mastered the high-caliber curriculum. One concern is that awarding such credentials too readily could dilute the value of the degree earned by students in the university's highly-selective traditional programs. But MIT officials said while OpenCourseWare has distributed knowledge widely, the lack of a credential keeps many from benefiting.
Many users ""want to have piece of paper saying they learned something and maybe that will help them get a job,"" Reif said.
Now MIT is looking to strike that balance  with an extra letter. University officials described ""MITx"" as a non-profit entity established inside the university that will offer an ""MIT-sanctioned certificate"" for completing various courses or, perhaps eventually, whole course sequences  though MIT emphasized full degrees will not be in the offing.
How exactly will it work? On a conference call Friday, university officials were short on many details  how many courses would eventually be offered, how much it would cost, even the name of the first course for the experiment in spring.
They did say they would focus, at least initially, on science and engineering, where assessment is fairly objective and easily scaled up. Users might include a high school senior who wants to take an early freshman class at MIT, or college students at overseas universities where a particular course isn't offered, explained Anant Agarwal, an electrical engineering and computer science professor who is helping lead the initiative.
Users will experience courses in a new, open-source online learning platform that will also be made available to other universities to operate themselves and develop their own courses. For each MIT course, students would find interactive videos and other materials, and could even potentially complete science laboratory assignments from afar.
It's not clear how much if any direct access participants would have to MIT faculty; as Agarwal described it, computer models might alert professors to the most common questions for them to address, but less common questions might be answered by other students taking the same course. Most assessments would be automated, but MIT said everyone would be held to the same standards as regular MIT students.
So far, everything would be free. But students who want to receive a credential from MITx might have to take an additional exam at a secure testing site to demonstrate mastery, and would also have to pay. The university said it hadn't decided yet how much to charge. Officials said they want the courses to be affordable, so prices might vary between countries, but they believe it's important for students to pay something.
Reif said ""money is not the driver."" But with MIT's global brand and the huge interest OpenCourseWare has already generated, there's clearly revenue potential. Roger Schonfeld, director of research at Ithaka S+R, who follows the field, said the potential market will depend on a range of factors  namely what MIT charges and whether other universities decide the MIT brand is meaningful enough that they will accept transfer credits from a program that is not-quite MIT.
While many universities  both for-profit and traditional  offer online courses for credit, Schonfeld said he believed this was the first time a highly selective university has offered a credential on this model.
Stanford offers a ""certificate of completion"" for some of the hugely popular online engineering courses it offers, but it holds no value as part of a degree program, the university said. Stanford's highly popular offerings on YouTube and iTunes offer no opportunities for credit, nor do the popular ""Open Yale"" courses.
But in a way, Schonfeld said, MIT's project is kind of a throw-back. A number of prominent universities, such as Harvard and NYU, have extension programs or colleges of general studies where they offer at least a version of their teaching to a much broader swath of the public than those who make it through the bottleneck of the traditional admissions process.
""The prospect of taking that kind of model, if that's what this is, into an online environment, and scaling it up into a global model is really exciting,"" he said.",1324287054

You could reuse almost all of your Unix build scripts, and the rest boils usually down to making your scripts aware of different file extensions (<i>.exe/</i>.dll instead of <i>/</i>.so).<p>Even better, you can do <i>cross compiling with MinGW</i>. So if your toolchain dosn't perform well on Windows, just use GCC as a cross compiler and build your stuff on a Linux or BSD machine. Then use Windows for testing the executable. (On smaller projects, you usually don't even need Windows for that, since Wine does the job as well.)<p>(Full disclosure: I'm the maintainer of a Free Software project that makes cross compiling via MinGW very handy: <a href=""http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/</a>)",1324286355

I've setup lots of build machines sans Visual Studio, projects build just fine with out it.<p>MSBuild does suck in that there is little implicit parallelism, but you can hack around it. I have a feeling that the Windows build slowness probably comes from that lack of parallelism in msbuild.<p>As for directory listings it may help to turn off atime, and if it's a laptop enable write caching to main memory. I'm not quite sure why Windows file system calls are so slow, I do know that NTFS supports a lot of neat features that are lacking on ext file systems, like auditing.<p>As for the bug mentioned, it's perfectly simple to load the wrong version of libc on linux, or hook kernel calls the wrong way. People hook calls on Windows because the kernel is not modifiable, and has a strict ABI, it's a disadvantage if you want to modify the behavior of Win32 / Kernel functions, but a huge advantage if you want to write say, graphics drivers and have them work after a system update.<p>Microsoft doesn't recommend hooking Win32 calls for the exact reasons outlined in the bug, if you do it wrong you screw stuff up, on the other hand, rubyists seem to love the idea that you can change what a function does at anytime. I think they call it 'dynamic programming'. I can make lots of things crash on Linux by patching ld.config so that a malware version of libc is loaded. I'd hardly blame the design of Windows when malware has been installed.<p>Every OS/Kernel involves design trade offs, not every trade off will be productive given a specific use case.",1324285842

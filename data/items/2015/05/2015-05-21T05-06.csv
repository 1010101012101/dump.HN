9581183,comment,9580742,9581105,0,0,ggreer,,,"One reason meditation is so varied is that it&#x27;s unlike most skills. You can&#x27;t learn it by watching someone else, and teachers can&#x27;t see if you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Progress is only made through trial, error, and dialogue. This is quite different from any physical activity, where visual feedback makes errors obvious.<p>To borrow an analogy from Sam Harris: Imagine if looking at the stars required building your own telescope. Nobody could ever see someone else&#x27;s telescope, or even the images from it. They could only listen to each others&#x27; descriptions. This would make research much harder and much less rigorous. But the stars would be no less beautiful. That&#x27;s the state of meditation today.",1432187980

9581133,comment,9566542,9576167,0,0,geoelectric,,,"With the caveat I haven&#x27;t read Lakos&#x27; book, there&#x27;s a pretty big backlash going on in the industry against hyper-granular unit testing. Comes down to people realizing that when their <i>implementation</i> needs to change, they often have to change a bunch of unit tests that were written to the implementation.<p>One problem is that modularity should let you change implementation without friction; that&#x27;s the whole point of modularity to begin with. So there&#x27;s not much profit in writing a bunch of client code (tests) that intentionally break modularity and put friction back on the process. It&#x27;s not quite as bad as just random breakage, because at least you know where it all is, but it&#x27;s still painful.<p>Another problem is that if you&#x27;re not careful, you end up with a set of tests that don&#x27;t tell you when something works as expected or not, it just tells you when something changed. Having a test that tells you something isn&#x27;t <i>coded</i> as expected anymore is pretty useless. You know you changed it.<p>And still another problem is that the testing itself has become too invasive. We&#x27;re architecting things for dependency injection that would never really need it if it weren&#x27;t for invasive tests. It&#x27;s fine and well to drop some testing hooks in, but if you&#x27;re having to completely invert control in your code to do it and that makes things significantly more complex, that may not be great.<p>I think there were some fairly recent Martin Fowler posts on this, but I believe his point was that we&#x27;re very possibly doing it wrong: if the point is to guarantee an interface then tests should be to the interface. And maybe injecting test doubles is good in some cases but too invasive in others--especially when it&#x27;s done to test an implementation--and so forth.<p>So not sure where Lakos is on the scale there, but what you describe about putting in layers upon granular layers of tests strikes me as setting yourself up for these issues. I&#x27;m a pretty big believer in testing to the interface, and do try to draw a line between functions that are there to serve a particular implementation and functions that describe something more abstract. I test to the latter.<p>Modularity is the key to maintenance; the biggest benefit of this type of testing to me is to validate your modularity, even more than validating the code within the modules.",1432186754

If not, there is no agreement, no deal. The other party was not suckering you, you were happy with the deal, you took it. Why do you put something as important as your salary entirely into someone else&#x27;s responsibility and then complain later?<p>Whoever raised or educated you forgot to mention some critical things to you.

Christians might &quot;meditate&quot; on a passage in the Bible. Theravada Buddhists have the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. There are Zen koans. I have no idea on other forms but I imagine there are way more.<p>Even among Theravada Buddhist meditation instructors there are clear disagreements on what the experience should be, how concentrated the mind should be, etc.<p>For example, for something as simple as a pull-up there are questions like: what muscles are being worked? What is the proper form? Pronated or supinated grip? What pace and why?<p>If I read an article on any subject I expect to see lots of footnotes.<p>Meditation is something way more subtle than doing pull-ups, yet most guides seem to assume that there is one concrete definition in the learner&#x27;s mind.

For a few months, people in China could buy Bitcoins using funds in yuan, transferred normally through the banking system in China.  Then they could sell the Bitcoins for dollars outside China. Then the People&#x27;s Bank of China (roughly equivalent to the US Fed and the US Treasury as a regulator) forbade that, and stopped all the Bitcoin exchanges in China from connecting to the banking system.<p>For those of you who don&#x27;t know, China has currency controls - it&#x27;s difficult to convert yuan to dollars from within mainland China.  There are ways around that, such as physically carrying yuan notes to Hong Kong, which is allowed up to some limit. But Chinese can&#x27;t just do a wire transfer to a bank outside China. Going through Bitcoin, for a brief period, allowed such moves.<p>After the PBC clamped down, it took a while for the Bitcoin community to get over its delusion that the PBC couldn&#x27;t do that. Then Bitcoin crashed.<p>Bitcoin mining in China may be an extension of that currency movement. From the standpoint of China&#x27;s financial system, Bitcoin mining looks like an export manufacturing business. That&#x27;s encouraged.  It&#x27;s OK to make stuff in China, sell it outside China, and keep the currency used to pay for it.  Bitcoin mining is inherently limited; only US$800K a day is generated, which is far too little to affect China&#x27;s exchange rate.  So there&#x27;s been no effort to crack down on that.",1432185938

9581048,comment,9577476,9577476,0,0,softgrow,,,"Buses bunch as they move further along the route as a consequence of having a dwell time (the time spent at the stop) that increases as a result of the number of passengers boarding at each stop increases AND having passengers arrive at each stop randomly. You can reduce bunching effects by:<p>* loading passengers who have already paid through multiple doors like Curitiba which every transport engineer includes on their honeymoon :)<p>* having passengers use smart cards rather than cash which is slower<p>* running infrequent services so passengers read the timetable and do not arrive at the bus stop randomly as their is an incentive to be their at the timetabled time.<p>The last method is obviously not acceptable in running a service but it highlights the curse of running frequent services. As frequency increases, people&#x27;s behaviour moves to &quot;turn up and go&quot; rather than read a timetable and the buses bunch. So you in effect trade waiting time, waiting for a timetabled service for bunch delay time. Hence one good reason to go for smart cards or bus platforms where you pay prior to boarding the platform like a train station to speed up loading.",1432184920

Most people I know that use paleo as a standard to live by don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the be all, end all. That if you eat anything you couldn&#x27;t get 60,000+ years it&#x27;s automatically bad, that isn&#x27;t how people that actually follow paleo go about it.<p>> There is no &quot;one and only&quot; stone age diet - you ate what was around you! The Inuit aren&#x27;t eating oranges and spinach, that stuff doesn&#x27;t grow in the tundra. Similarly, you won&#x27;t be eating deer and bison in Greece, but you will be eating fish and olives.<p>The fact that you put this out as an argument against further proves what im saying, I really don&#x27;t see how this applies to anyone but the hardcore strict paleo which doens&#x27;t really exist outside of the ones who write and sell books.<p>> There are societies across many geographic regions with long life expectancies, and their diets vary wildly.<p>Yes, these kind of conversations are the ones I find myself having with paleo-minded people more often. About trying to work out what food our bodies work better with, I really am stumped as to why you are seeing this is a knock on paleo.<p>> The Grecians eat lots of fruits, veggies, olive oil, fish, goat milk and wine. The Japanese eat soybeans, sweet potatoes, white rice, seaweed, and fish. Sardinians eat lots of game, goat cheese/milk, beans, and barley. Each is home to peoples with the longest life expectancy on earth today, and each has at least one staple that is not considered paleo friendly.<p>If you read the book outliers you would also know that food isn&#x27;t the only contributing factor to life expectancy by a long shot. The example in the book about the greek town who by any dietary standards was eating incredibly faty and unhealthy foods had extraordinary high life expectancy, believed to be due to their extremely high happiness due to their tight-knit social structure.<p>> Alan Aragon did a great talk critiquing the paleo diet, which you can read more about here<p>I don&#x27;t see why I should even bother when you start off your comment talking about the dogma needs to stop and you throw out a bunch of half assed arguments which don&#x27;t address paleo directly.<p>This dogma needs to stop.",1432184834

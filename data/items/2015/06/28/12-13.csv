I&#x27;m no expert on the culture, but I&#x27;d assume that public drinking is a great deal more socially acceptable in South India.<p>Singapore is lucky enough to be close to a tremendous supply of inexpensive human capital - even more so than the US/Mexico. Their immigration policy allows low-paying marine/construction jobs to be filled quickly, but workers&#x27; rights are essentially nonexistent.<p>Those 12% of foreign workers are almost all guaranteed to be earning enough to support themselves and their families back home - and that&#x27;s without the benefit of a minimum wage or membership in an effective union. This sort of public policy may attract foreign investment, but it&#x27;s unfair to the workers that have made Sg rich and it&#x27;s unlike anything seen in the rest of the developed world.<p>>not to mention the ST has had its own feuds with the Singaporean government\nAre you referring to the long-standing tradition of the PAP suing print journalists for libel?<p>I was browsing the front page of their site after I looked up coverage of the riots.

Some of these are just slow at updating, but will eventually get around to it at some point. However given how old Django is now, there&#x27;s going to be plenty of old projects which clutter up search results for packages which are no longer maintained.<p>Maybe djangopackages.com could add support/filtering to hide outdated Django projects. Or perhaps the encouragement could come in a more official way with a Django Package Index - a site which uses PyPI data, but with filtering biased towards the current released version of Django to encourage people who maintain those packages to get a new version out with support for the latest version.",1435495621

However, Germany and France were breaking max deficit rules at the time, and they would look like huge hypocrites if they complained about Greece&#x27;s numbers. So they didn&#x27;t. Rose colored glasses and political expedience played a huge role here.<p>- A country can&#x27;t go bankrupt. They can simply refuse to pay their debts, and because they&#x27;re a sovereign nation they&#x27;re in their right to do so.<p>- When banks lend money to a country it isn&#x27;t charity. They get interest payments and in exchange risk not getting paid back at all if things go sour. It was astoundingly unwise for banks to lend money to Greece at practically zero interest (as they did during the boom period). Had the banks been responsible, or had the oversight institutions not been asleep at the wheel, this crisis would not have happened.<p>- The banks who lent to Greece got 90% of the bailout package. Not the people of Greece. So it&#x27;s not true Greece received &quot;several hundred billion in aid&quot;.<p>- &quot;Some would say it is doubtful whether they are actually effective at all.&quot;.

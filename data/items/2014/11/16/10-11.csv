Do you know any craft, e.g. sewing, that could be used to make money in that market. Motorbike saddles, tarpaulins, seats and cushions are things I produce when tired from coding. Hand crafted quality sells well, and builds up a customer base that is even more loyal then a mainframe service contract.<p>Especially the biker scene has the tendency of regular up or outs. Some bikers move up, others move out, when ever a club closes, or is patched over. Same happens to good quality saddles also. So even if you do not sell to the Angles right now, they will might ride your saddles in 10 or 20 years, and they will be top paying customers.<p>Same same but different with sailing boats. Even if one can not move a tarpaulin from one boat to an other, like you could do with a Harley saddle, the sailors themself move up or out regular. They either buy a bigger boat, or quit sailing.

Look at where it was published.  Proceedings for a CPSC conference in Bangalore.  Bangalore!  This paper started an entire field that entire departments at multiple universities are devoted to now. If it hadn&#x27;t been so radical at the time it would have made it into a high impact journal.  Instead, IEEE conference proceedings, Bangalore.<p>I went through grad-school in this field. This paper started it all so, needless to say, I wanted to see an original copy of it.  <i>I never found one</i>.  These conference proceedings were not widely distributed. People passed around copies of copies of copies and there were, of course, reprints in other publications. I had to borrow a book that included this paper as a chapter from my supervisor, and that wasn&#x27;t long ago.  The only reason I was able to read this field-creating paper was because, even though the peer-reviewed journals that should have jumped at the chance to publish this work balked, other people recognized something good in it. Today, a pdf of the original is linked to by Wikipedia.<p>How much bold, radical, totally unpublishable (in any respectable journal) work is out there waiting to be dusted off and used to start new fields of study?  BB84 could have slipped through the cracks.  It&#x27;s a safe bet that other such work actually did go unnoticed.

8613866,comment,8611922,8612953,0,0,andolanra,,,"JavaScript is <i>not</i> a homoiconic language, because the important feature of homiconicity is not that the syntax &quot;mirrors&quot; the syntax of data, but that the syntax is <i>actually represented</i> as a piece of data that can be manipulated in the language.<p>For example, in Scheme, I can easily generate data structures and interpret them as code to be executed <i>or as data to be manipulated</i>. For example, here I can generate code corresponding to a given factorial, and also muck with it.<p><pre><code>    > (define (fact-code n)\n        (if (= n 0) 1 `(* ,n ,(fact-code (- n 1)))))\n    > (fact-code 4)\n    (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1)))\n    > (eval (fact-code 4) (the-environment))\n    24\n    > (eval (replace &#x27;* &#x27;+ (fib-code 4)) (the-environment))\n    10\n</code></pre>\nWe can write a function similar to <i>fact-code</i> in Rebol, which I&#x27;m borrowing from an earlier comment[^1]<p><pre><code>  >> fact-code: func [n] [either n = 1 [1] [compose [(n) * (fact-code n - 1)]]]\n  \n  >> fact-code 4\n  == [4 * 3 * 2 * 1]\n  \n  >> do fact-code 4\n  == 24\n\n  >> do replace/all fact-code 4 &#x27;* &#x27;+\n  == 10\n</code></pre>\nThere is no analogous way of generating and manipulating JavaScript code using JavaScript. If <i>all</i> JS code could be understood as JSON that then could be fed back into JavaScript and manipulated there, then it would be homoiconic.<p>[^1]: Borrowed from this older comment with a minor name change <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5809980"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5809980</a>",1416132955

They have more influence on &quot;discovery&quot; of everything from podcasts, books, applications, journalists, and everything else than any other company. They certainly use that weight. They can get users to any of their products. But, it is true that these products are not usually very lock-in. Search is very easy to switch from. Gmail is pretty easy.  Network effect products like Wave, talk, circles, hangouts are actually the products Google has had trouble getting traction with. They got users, but not the lead in their markets.<p>MS have &quot;weight&quot; with OEMs and decision makers at companies from one man shows to fortune 500. They use that, which creates a nasty distance between liking the software you personally use and the decision to keep using it. Even Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s website is made with frontpage.<p>Apple have an interesting version of this. It may be their achilles heel, but it&#x27;s also made them bold and creative. Apple products sell to the public, not to businesses and not through businesses. They don&#x27;t rely on deals with OEMs, retailers, distributors, corporate buyers or telcoms to make sales. They don&#x27;t even rely on discounts and competitive pricing. They definitely don&#x27;t chase price/feature niches. More than any other company they rely on sheer consumer demand for their products. That means they would find it very hard to survive a &quot;Windows Vista&quot; period of ambivalence about their products. The trait is probably a long term liability. But, it is a version of level paying field, win by winning approach that produces bold product decisions.<p>All three are &quot;cheats&quot; by some standards, including (probably) the standards of the other two.",1416132482

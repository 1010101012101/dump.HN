Of course not, because that's not how laws work.  They can <i>try</i> to extradite me, of course, but no reasonable country would ever assist them.  Similarly, it makes very little sense to extradite programmers at Megaupload.  Sure, Megaupload is probably illegal in the US.  But we're not in the US, so it doesn't matter.  (They got the extradition by saying that Megaupload is laundering money, among other things.  This is like extraditing a coffee shop owner in Amsterdam for selling pot.  It's illegal in the US, after all, and he's laundering his ill-gotten money by pretending to sell coffee.)<p>This is garbage and I can't believe any court in the world would uphold this extradition.

3487881,comment,3485933,3486397,4,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Do socially awkward people only out-compete socially smooth people strictly in situations where interaction among humans is truly minimal?<p>As someone who's been socially awkward in the past (yet good with math, a typical nerd type I guess) but who eventually taught himself to be social to the extent that I can arguably surpass most of my former friends at this game (yet who is nowhere near Paris Hilton yet), here is my hard-won perspective:<p>1. Being truly social requires two things: (a) social experience, (2) a sophisticated theory of mind, a brain ""faculty"" that is incredibly resource-intensive, possibly more so than the faculty which performs abstract reasoning. In evolutionary biology, there is an influential theory which claims that it was theory of mind (which is being able to figure out what others think) that developed due to the pressure of living in groups and not tool-making that was the original cause of humans becoming sentient. This is why I don't believe for a second those who say that women are less smart than men (most women were simply taught to be dependent on others from the early age).<p>2. Our education system especially tends to value social skills less than hard problem-solving skills and therefore convinces us at early age that being social requires less brain power than doing math (because ""brainy"" is always ""good""). This is because of two things (1) people with high social skills are somewhat more likely to steal money from you or cheat or use you in some other way without you ever knowing it, (2) most people except the autistic minority are capable of powerful theory-of-mind type thinking given enough social exposure, while only a select minority (whether because of education or biology) is capable of high-level abstract reasoning.<p>3. At one point in my life I felt I could be very social if I wanted (and I indeed could), yet I still avoided social interactions because being social felt incredibly draining to me (all those neurons firing consume glucose...) and I did not learn yet to derive pleasure from being social.<p>4. People who are very good at being social (past a certain threshold) derive a lot of pleasure from it, to the extent that they forgo most non-social intellectual pursuits which they perceive as less rewarding. This is actually a dangerous trap to fall into (similar to a drug addiction) if your main area of work requires quiet contemplation.<p>5. People who are truly brilliant (I'm not there yet) learn to balance the amount of interaction with others (and pick those they interact with carefully) because they understand that social withdrawal can give them a serious advantage, since most of the society (perhaps except tiger-educated Asian kids) falls squarely into the social-driven category.",1327023675

Layout-wise it makes sense as preset layouts, but other than that the group doesn't help at all.<p>The best split-screen implementation is E-Text Editor.  In E, you can drag the tab to create a new split, then ""Cmd T"" in ANY tab will bring you to the previously opened file in the split.  Basically I don't have to remember where the file is opened, as long as I know its name, I can just jump by typing the name.  That is how quick jump should be.  Also, you can arrange the windows by dragging-and-dropping to another split.  I stop using E after version 1 because I made the switch Mac and I have to use Textmate, which does not support split-screen at all (what a shame!).  And I miss E dearly.<p>Currently Sublime Text quick jump is still bad, because it still requires a context switch (switch to the group that has the file opened, then Cmd T), or worse, complete loss of current context (Cmd T would open the file in current group, thus you lose the view of the current file you're working on).<p>So as long as split-view doesn't get implemented properly, Sublime Text is still just another editor.",1327023296

I can say that the 1% of middlemen and lawyers that call themselves 'rightsholders' are afraid of people point out how bloated they are, and how Un-American it is to be bad at your job, inefficient, and dictatorial.

3487787,comment,3484164,3487685,-1,0,snowwrestler,,,"I would put your position into the ""clearly less informed"" camp, sorry.<p>Copyright originally was created as a legal concept shortly after the invention of the printing press* because individual small printers were making and selling copies of other people's books. At that time (about 400 years ago), there were no ""well capitalized industrialists."" The industrial revolution had not even happened yet, and the few corporations that existed at all were captives of the sovereign rulers who created them.<p>In addition, from the very beginning, copyright was an individual author right that accrued to people, not companies. That is how it was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for instance, although at that point in time it was already an old concept. The idea that it has always been (or is even today) a matter of industrial law is not accurate.<p>> In truth, copyright law - as it exists - is fundamentally and irredeemably incompatible with a democratic society in which citizens have the power to duplicate and distribute at virtually no cost.<p>This is the exact opposite of how public policy works. It is the very ease of copying that creates the need for a legal framework to regulate it. Before the printing press existed, copyright did not exist either--because it was not needed.<p>In a free society where copying is free, the most precious thing is original throught, original opinion, original content. That is the last true scarcity, and must be protected. Otherwise how are we to distinguish one citizen from another?<p>* BTW it is worth spending some time reviewing the history of the printing press and the impact it had on the world. I would argue that it was much more of a revolution than the Internet has been so far, although of course the Internet is still in its early stages of development.",1327021832

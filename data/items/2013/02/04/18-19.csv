In the case of building computers - you take a bunch of components from individual producers, slap them together & call it a new product.  The actual work done is very little & the margins are small but the total cost of the finished product has to reflect the cost of the components.  Putting $10 of labor and $5 of infrastructure to make $5 of profit on top of a $1000 device become unfeasible.<p>Reading the article, they claim an operation like this is an ideal remedy to being ""too big"" yet their proposed tax plan makes it untenable.",1360004397

As with most technological shifts, IDE market share has grown very quickly and has come to seem normal, but that doesn't mean the previous approach has stopped being useful. I would guess that in absolute terms there are as many people writing code sans IDE as ever. When you consider the growth in web services, and the fact that people coding in languages like Python and Ruby often just use plain text editors, it may well be the case that the popularity of IDEs has already peaked.",1360004389

I've had my design work copied before, so I know that there is an emotional response that comes along with having your work copied. But there also needs to be a practical assessment of what impact the copying will have on your business. If the site(s) copying you aren't big names and aren't competing with you, it's likely a waste of your time and energies to be pursuing them. That's time being taken away from your core business to focus on other people that ultimately have an inconsequential impact on your ability to be competitive and make money.",1360004365

We are responsible for the consequences of our actions, but our obligation to our fellow man is circumscribed by context and reasonable expectations. There may be situations in which it is reasonable to expect someone to kill himself, but this was not one of those situations. Carmen Ortiz cannot be held responsible, morally, for someone's unreasonable reaction to her actions.

5166104,comment,5162170,5163306,0,0,shmerl,,,"<i>>for subscription services DRM doesn't even get in the way</i><p>You are saying that some DRM doesn't get in the way, how is it exactly? DRM prevents users from using their system of choice, since DRM is practically never cross platform, and DRM stands in the way of copying (that's what it's created for) i.e. in a way of copying for legitimate purpose such as format and time shifting, backups, accessibility and various other applications of fair use. To put it practically - can you use Netflix on Linux let's say? Not without jumping through some weird hoops. Can you make backups from Netflix content? No. So I'd challenge that it's transparent and doesn't get in the way.<p><i>>  It's a necessary evil, I fear.</i><p>No, it's an unnecessary evil. And there will be online content without DRM - content creators just need to come to grips with reality and do the right thing. DRM doesn't add any value - it only degrades it for legitimate users.<p>Content creators have two ways forward. First is dropping all DRM, which makes experience better for end users, and respects paying customers. It doesn't stop piracy, but it provides incentive to buy from those who treat customers with respect. Second way is pushing DRM, degrading the experience of paying customers and treating them as potential criminals by default. This way doesn't stop piracy as well, but such disrespect towards legitimate paying users doesn't create any incentive to deal with content creators and distributors who treat people this way, and artificial limitations which degrade the experience and flexibility of such content reduce the incentive even more (guess what incentive they increase? Exactly - for piracy).<p>Music industry realized that DRM doesn't offer them any benefits (and only offers disadvantages) so they dropped pushing it. Other industries are still catching up with the idea, but they'll come to it. DRM as a trend is dying, though in many areas DRM free distribution channels are still a minority. You can get more and more DRM free e-books, DRM free distributors like GOG and Desura show that it's not needed at all for gaming. What's really dragging behind is video distribution. Besides DVDs where DRM is trivially removable, there are virtually no DRM free channels especially for streaming. But I don't see any conceptual difference between music, books, games or videos and etc. In any of these cases DRM offers nothing positive to end users (totally on the contrary) as well as doesn't prevent piracy. So as a trend - it's dying but it will take time for it to be gone forever.<p>My whole point was - it doesn't make sense to make a Web standard out of a dying trend which on top is unethical and user hostile. Therefore Netflix is doing a really bad thing with pushing DRM into HTML standard.",1360003593

Current weapons use canned neutron generators which are effectively black boxes, inert until needed and long lasting.

5165930,comment,5165667,5165761,4,0,lutusp,,,"> The hardest part of developing a nuclear weapon(as i understand, correct if wrong) is actually getting the fissile material.<p>No, not for a plutonium-triggered fusion weapon (or a plutonium fission weapon). Getting some plutonium involves setting up a breeder reactor (as Iran is now doing). That's hard, but not really hard.<p>The hard part of a plutonium weapon design is setting it off. Plutonium has a natural decay rate that's high enough that the core must be assembled very quickly to avoid a ""fizzle"", an event where a chance natural disintegration triggers a non-optimal chain reaction, before the core is fully assembled and at maximum density.<p>The single most difficult part of the Manhattan Project was solving this problem, not acquiring the plutonium used in the devices. The core must be assembled very, very fast, then an abrupt pulse of neutrons must be generated at the precise moment of maximum core density.<p>The Manhattan Project U-235 weapon ""Little Boy"" was a very simple design that resembles a gun barrel, because the natural decay rate in U-235 is low enough that there is little chance of an inadvertent chain reaction. In fact, that design wasn't even tested in advance -- the prototype was just dropped on Hiroshima with full expectation that it would work.<p>The ""Fat Man"" design was the plutonium device, and the prototype was tested -- on July 16, 1945 -- at great effort and cost, because the team was sufficiently doubtful that it would work as designed.<p>During the project, a great deal of effort went into designing lenses of high explosive, meant to symmetrically compress the plutonium core and assure correct functioning, but with very, very fast assembly.<p>So core assembly is by far the most difficult part, and remains so today.",1360002102

That was in the job description and we talked about it during interviews. It was a deal breaker, for me, if the candidate was unable to commit an hour over the time between ""Friday and the next work day"" to manage answering tickets and helping customers.<p>But going from zero employees of any kind to two full-time CS employees so that you can save time is foolhardy, at least in the short term. If you think you have no time to code now, just wait until you have employees yet have no training plan/manual for them to follow. I'd suggest you find one ""all around"" person and have them do CS as part of their job. The other parts of their job are various admin duties - mail, filing receipts, etc. If you find that, after 3-6 months, you need another employee, then you have a built-in trainer for the new person.",1360001625

The paper is suggesting a difference of ~10000 cycles, which may be ~5us. So, yes, you need to have a good connection to the server to be able to measure that difference, but that's not unthinkable to me. I know that you could get such a connection to a Google server if you were willing to pay some money to get a machine hosted in the right place.<p>But it also appears that it's fairly easy to get a process instantiated on the same EC2 host as a target application.

Saying that it's secure as long as you don't allow the attacker to be close by, or you don't run it on a slow machine isn't good enough for me.<p>But I admit that it's unlikely to anyone will ever actually perform this attack in anger.

I think managers do have a careful balance between helping candidates (providing full disclosure as to why they rejected) and potential exposure (being sued or coming across the wrong way), so they tend to err on the side of caution.  But having dealt with many managers, they too are in a time crunch, especially if they are being fed lots of unqualified or unvetted candidates (the numbers game you allude to) and also fear the risk.  This is more prevalent in the contingency recruiting market.<p>The manager should have the incentive to provide great feedback to the recruiter, as the recruiter will hopefully hit the target better on future candidates if they are aware why their candidates are being rejected.  The recruiter has little incentive to share that feedback with candidates other than goodwill and keeping the relationship strong with the candidate.  I always try to get feedback from managers for my own purposes and for helping my candidates improve, but it isn't always as easy as you'd think.",1360000910

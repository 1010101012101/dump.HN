Gambling creates a lot of problems that are not paid by the companies or individuals participating, but by the society at large. The heavy taxing and limited advertising makes a lot of sense so the industry is accounted for all that hidden costs. \nGambling addiction is a real issue that harms families and communities. If the gambling industry doesn&#x27;t takes care of that paying higher taxes, that same communities are the ones dealing with that extra cost. A social lose-lose situation. \nFor me an ever better solution is state owned gambling. It is much more controlled and it is harder to open loopholes for abusing it using bribes, historically a common thing with this kind of industry.",1454140777

So is the IoT space, both in APIs and in actual hardware designs.<p>Another situation is things that are fundamentally valuable yet unprofitable. Like drugs that are out of patent and have multiple uses but are not FDA approved for all those uses. Or figuring out how to make more existing research actually public and shared as widely as possible.<p>Another situation is areas where the existing research establishment is busted. Reproducibility is a big one here. Try finding articles in Nature or Science that you can&#x27;t reproduce and then make a big stink about their results being false.<p>Overall though I think every answer to this question should include an answer to, &quot;why is this a better fit for YC Research than for a new startup&quot;.",1454140222

What&#x27;s actually sensitive is your files, your saved passwords, your browser cookies, your emails, etc.; the ability to reconfigure drivers or replace OS components is only a problem because it allows all of those things to be compromised. Instead of throwing roadblocks in the way of root (remount ro, expose it as something more complicated than a filesystem so innocent users aren&#x27;t tempted to look at it, etc.), let&#x27;s take all the stuff that users <i>should</i> be able to do and make it accessible by nonroot, and take all the stuff they shouldn&#x27;t be able to do and put it in the realm of automation.<p>UEFI has a pretty reasonable concept here, of a distinction between &quot;boot&quot; and &quot;runtime&quot; configuration; the BSDs have a conceptually similar idea of the securelevel. The idea is that if you&#x27;re around during the boot, you might be interested in reconfiguring what the machine is doing, but as soon as you&#x27;re out, you permanently abjure any further ability to reconfigure that. If we take a variant on that, that the OS doesn&#x27;t abjure those capabilities as a whole but instead reserves them for itself, disabling all user-controlled ability to change things, I think we get very far. You can install new software, but not change the trusted sources for software. You can apply firmware updates via an existing cronjob, but not make arbitrary changes to firmware variables. If you want to do any of that, you have to reboot and enter a special setup mode. Apart from protecting against simple human error, this also serves as a very effective protection against malware: non-OS software simply has no ability to do unwanted things.<p>Then let&#x27;s use UNIX users (which are a pretty solid isolation technique) to isolate things like your banking info from your Flash-requiring music service.<p>Chrome OS, incidentally, has this concept of things the OS can do that the user has no interface to, and Chrome OS is basically the most successful Linux on the desktop, so.",1454139606

It is also a little edgy for most governments, who would prefer people to default to a centralized fiat asset system that is more taxable but usually very high-friction and change resistant. It is also very connected to the basic income notion, as it should easily facilitate concrete modeling of the benefits of such against arbitrary academic models, including actor-emulation, risk-model tuning for all parties and failure simulations: Chaos Monkey for business, economic, legal and social systems. Quite possible impact in law.<p>It should also work well for modeling a lot of the other ideas presented in this thread and others (eg. Shypmate et al), so many in fact that quoting them in brief apparently exceeded a length limit.<p>The fact that <i>so many</i> of these suggestions could potentially benefit from a decently extensible, actor-based approach to economic (maybe &#x27;social&#x27;) and risk modeling becoming open source standardized (and thence easily neural network explorable) suggests strongly that it is a useful area of research. When the idea was first raised, someone from the IETF energy working group suggested it would be a great way to model electrical power in national grids (and possibly in embedded applications). There are no doubt other real-world economies that would love a reasonable toolkit.<p>I believe that, if backed by YCR, possible members of an initially rapidly assembled team could include 1x very high level, successful global finance entrepreneur and executive (British; already investing in the area, keen to work together, met personally last week), and 1x pure maths + quantative finance masters (Australian) currently wasting brainpower in a conventional investment house sharing interest in the field. The nature of the problem domain is certainly more long term YCR than startup, so it&#x27;s hard for any of us to dedicate time at present.",1454139246

The reason being, if you care about your career, it ends up being 20% _on top of_ 120% you&#x27;re already putting in.<p>From what I&#x27;ve heard from close friends who work at Google, this depends a lot on the team you&#x27;re on and the manager you have. If you Google around a bit you&#x27;ll see a lot of mixed feedback on the idea for this reason.<p>> And I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather the company did not know about anything I do on my own time and with my own resources, so that they couldn&#x27;t lay any intellectual property claims to it.<p>They don&#x27;t need to know about anything you do on your own time to lay IP claims on it. In California at least, there are very clear rules [0] that state that an employer can lay claim to IP under a number of conditions, none of which is that the employer knew it was happening at the time.<p>If it&#x27;s anything worthwhile, it&#x27;s likely to come up on your employer&#x27;s radar at some point. It&#x27;s better just to be upfront about such things instead of sneaking around. If you can&#x27;t trust your employer you should probably find a new one.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=02001-03000&file=2870-2872"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&gr...</a>",1454137658

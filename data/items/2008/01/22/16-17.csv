Well I somehow doubt that, especially as they didn't fix any of the problems that created the recession.

I'm not sure which one is the case though I really hope it's me.<p>The reckless mortgage boom and the ensuing crisis was caused when the Fed cut rates to avoid recession and made borrowing so easy. Now to fix the mess caused by lowering interest rates, they're trying to lower interest rates?<p>If you're bleeding from your wrists because you slashed your wrist with a knife, you don't slash your arm higher up to stop the bleeding from the wrists. Well true, it does stop you from bleeding from the wrists but now you're bleeding from the upper arm! Of course, you can stop the bleeding there by slitting your biceps. Pretty soon you're going to have to cut off your arm to ""stop"" the bleeding.<p>How about they just let there be a recession so the organizations that were investing poorly lose money and go out of business while the investors who were smart and focussed stay in the game?",1201018472

102242,comment,101506,101904,0,0,lylia,,,"""there should be more women in CS and that the industry is extremely sexist.""<p>I don't think the industry is extremely sexist at all.  If anything, it's incredibly equalizing.  I do web design, code in XHTML/CSS, and manipulate PHP/ASP/JavaScript -- it's how I make my living.  I don't think any other field has such an emphasis on raw skill and talent, and if anyone demonstrates the ability to do it, the field welcomes it.<p>I took only one course in CS, got a fluff degree in liberal arts, and can never call myself a ""hacker"" because I'm just a code monkey, but I've been attracted to the technology / computer field since I was 12.  A lot of things here are interesting to me, so I read this daily (and sometimes resubmit to reddit if it hasn't already been submitted).<p>If a woman wants to make it in this field through her looks, wit and charm alone, she won't.  She can't expect the fact she's female to give her any edge whatsoever, just like the men in this field do not expect to be given breaks because of their maleness.  If she wants to make it through her skill, ingenuity, problem-solving ability and willingness to learn new things, she'll do just fine.",1201018196

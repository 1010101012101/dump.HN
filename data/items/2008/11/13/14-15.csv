363086,comment,363066,363066,0,0,beaudeal,,,"My first piece of advice would be this: don't bank on YC funding. Sure, it would be great if you got accepted, but that shouldn't stop you from pursuing your idea. Especially if it is still just an idea - work on it at home, in your spare time, and then evaluate your options once you have done everything you possibly can do on your own.<p>If you decide that you need outside funding, and even Mountain View is too far, then your options for YC (or a similar program) become more limited. The next YC round will be in Cambridge, but there is TechStars in Boulder, Colorado which is obviously much closer, but may still be too far.  The only other programs I have heard of are in the Philly / DC areas.<p>Like you said though, there are more traditional routes. A Google search for 'arizona angel network' brings up over 2m hits. My point is that, I'm sure there are options, you just need to look for them, and then evaluate.<p>First things first, though: start hacking!",1226588300
363085,comment,362694,363059,0,0,jd,,,"No. No. No. It doesn't matter. Not one bit. Exception: for FF maintainers, opera programmers. But ordinary javascript programmers never have to worry about a ms here or there.<p>Let me quote again from your blog post:<p><i>This was quite odd since the tests should've taken, at least, a couple milliseconds to run and getting consistent times of ""0"" is rather infeasible, especially for non-trivial code.</i><p>Conclusion 1: The code _is_ trivial! Why? it takes < 64ms to execute.<p>Conclusion 2: The actual time spent by the code doesn't matter, because you can't notice the difference between the reported 0ms and the actual 3ms or so that it takes to execute.<p>Next paragraph:<p><i>Second, I was running some performance tests, on Internet Explorer, in the SlickSpeed selector test suite and noticed the result times drastically fluctuating. When trying to figure out if changes that you've made are beneficial, or not, it's incredibly difficult to have the times constantly shifting by 15 - 60ms every page reload</i><p>Why does it matter if loads 15ms to 60ms faster/slower? It's not noticeable. And once you see that the difference is roughly 15ms a quick google search will reveal it's a simple timer accuracy issue.<p>So why the graphs? Why test different browsers on different platforms when the outcome can't be anything else than the 60ms fluctuations you've already seen? But you knew the second you saw a single time reported as 0ms that that the time accuracy is not on the 1ms precision level, which means that they use GetTickCount or something which has a 15ms precision.<p>> It certainly wasn't obvious to the WebKit, Firefox, and Chrome teams who were all happily testing on Windows XP using bum tests<p>If they used the tests they would've noticed the 0ms results. Therefore, they either thought 0ms means it's <15ms, which is fast enough, or they tested it primarily on other platforms.<p>I don't believe for a second that the WebKit, Firefox and Chrome teams have done ms comparisons with tests that don't report data on the ms level. 0ms results stand out, after all. They probably are pretty smart people, and they realized it doesn't matter.<p>> Any performance tests are better than no performance tests<p>Nope. Silly performance tests are worse than no performance tests.",1226588264

363075,comment,362626,362842,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"Revenue is great.  But what about profitability?  Right now it is unclear how they will ever profit and I think you have to take that into account when you make your valuation.  You can't say, ""well Google did not know how they were going to profit but they figured it out"" because when you do that you just bloat the evaluation through mindless speculation.  Bloated valuations == bubble, which is why I think we may be blaming fb if/when the next tech bubble arrives.<p>Revenue is relatively easy to generate.  Profit is much more difficult.  I have seen revenue projections between 250 and 300 mil for this year, which is ~2.08 to 2.50 per user.  That sucks.  Plain and simple.  End of story.  It costs more per user to run the site right now.<p>Then again (yes I am arguing with myself) the valuation can and should take into account what someone else could do with that data.

I think that you can get all the expressibility of OWL and more using rules - in fact the fastest current OWL reasoner, OwlIm, is based on using rules to model owl. A constraint like this would be something like SELECT ?invalid WHERE { ?invalid rdf:Type your:Class . ?invalid your:value1 ?v1 . ?invalid your:value2 ?v2 . FILTER(?v1>?v2) } Sparql queries can contain a construct clause which turns them into rules. For querying an RDF view of a relational database, I don't think anyone has solved this yet - D2RQ tries but like you say the performance tends to suck. A lot of the current promising work is using triple stores to store RDF directly, with a big leader in Franz with Allegrograph.",1226586894

363065,comment,362810,362976,0,0,owkaye,,,"thanks mseebach, I don't think your concept will work (and I've been known to be wrong before) ... but at least I understand how you're approaching the problem, and that helps me to get a better grasp of how I might have to go about it.<p>It seems to me that I'll have the fastest performance by storing all the bid values in a single 'column' (in RAM of course) to make it faster to find a new unique high bid when someone posts a bid that matches the existing unique high bid.  So here's my current concept of how to structure the RAM data:<p>Create a RAM-based 'table' with only two 'columns', bidValue and bidStatus.  The bidStatus column will store a single character such as 'D' for a duplicate bid, or 'U' for a unique bid, or 'H' for the unique high bid.  Then go through this procedure when someone posts a new bid:<p>- See if his bid matches the 'H' bidValue:<p>- If so, change the bidStatus from 'H' to 'D' then identify the new unique high bid and change that bidStatus from 'U' to 'H'.<p>- If not, and if there is already a matching bidValue in the table, set that bidStatus to 'D'<p>- If not, and if there's no matching bidValue in the table, append a new row, then:<p>---------- If the bidValue in the new row is lower than the one in the 'H' row, set the bidStatus to 'U'<p>---------- If the bidValue in the new row is higher than the one in the 'H' row, set the bidStatus to 'H and change the old 'H' status to 'U'<p>- Append the new bidValue, timeStamp and bidderID to another RAM-based table designed to store this data for each bidder (to create an archive of the auction).<p>-- Send the status of the member's new bid back to him so he will see it in his browser.",1226586558

Why would any company rely on a yet to be successful rocket to launch them into space?<p>Don't get me wrong it's a cool idea but wouldn't you want some reasonable assurance of success ie: past success before you forked over your cash?",1217782441
265609,comment,265575,265598,0,0,breck,,,"This appears to be a design pattern on a number of blogs. You know how ""Top 10"" type lists are so popular and easy to do? It appears this pattern is also popular, and even easier to do.<p>1. Take list someone else researched(successful YC startups).<p>2. Write first idea that comes to mind for each one(generally something obvious, wrong, and controversial).<p>3. Hit publish.<p>You get to capitalize on a number of proven traffic techniques--lists, pingbacks, and controversy--for only a few minutes of work.",1217782437
265608,comment,264943,265433,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I disagree with your central thesis. Programming is the stringing together of predefined constructs.</i><p>I see what you mean. Yes, but in not the sense I meant. My point is that the predefined constructs in the GoF book are at varying levels of abstraction and granularity, and mostly can't effectively be strung together in the way the book implied. That's my attempt to explain why people mostly created messes when they tried (an empirical observation).<p>If DP were actually about ""indirection and abstract techniques"" per se, that would be fine. But it's more than that. It's a cookbook of specific clumps of indirection and abstraction. And I don't think programs can be decomposed into those clumps or composed out of them.",1217782193

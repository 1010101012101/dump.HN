Sometimes lack of concentration is due to lack of a structured plan of attack on your 'todo' items. Breaking it into small pieces can also help by not making it some sort of 'monumental' task that you feel is going to take a long time causing you to allow yourself time to do other things because the task isn't going to be immediately done.",1255024780

A recent example is that it took FREAKING forever before Firefox 3.5 was in the Ubuntu repositories, and it's still only in Jaunty.

869510,comment,869034,869034,0,0,angelbob,,,"One thing I had to work hard to figure out is that I code in two different ways, and I need to alternate them.  They are physically incompatible -- I can only be doing one or the other in a given hour or so.<p>One of these is design.  When designing (software, not visually) I need to avoid getting into ruts.  I need to rethink constantly and brainstorm frequently.  I should consider wildly different or thoroughly impractical structures for code and programs, because those frequently lead to more practical but non-obvious ideas.  Design mindset is facilitated by having enough sleep/rest, having eaten reasonably (especially protein, but not too much), and not having much else on my mind.<p>The other mindset is for execution.  I need to take that design and churn through it.  I'm not rethinking, I'm building.  This mindset is excellent for churning out a lot of code fast when I have a good understanding of it.  I do less of this in Ruby than in C (less grind-work!), but it's still important on occasion.  Execution mindset is helped by minimal distractions, caffeine or other stimulants, and being slightly tired and undernourished, as long as it doesn't get too extreme.<p>These states alternate, and different coding tasks call for different proportions of one versus the other.

She lost control and there ended up being a whole franchise of 'Teach yourself X with Laura Lemay' books.<p>EDIT: Found the link. Thanks archive.org!<p>""I wrote a lot of books from 1994 to 2000. Both my HTML and Java books did really well, and I had a series that I didn’t write that nonetheless had my name on it. It felt like I was riding this wave of popularity, I would probably never be this successful again, and I felt that I had to milk it, to push it as far as it would go. My publisher was all too happy to accommodate me in this goal. They reworked my writing over and over again, customizing it, repackaging it, reselling it under different titles and for different purposes. I cheerfully and naively agreed to a lot of this repurposing, but a lot of it happened without my knowing it under the terms of existing contracts. I would go into bookstores and find books there with my name on them that I had never seen or agreed to or had any idea they existed.<p>With this much writing being produced not all of it had to be great. Towards the end not much of it was. By the end I didn’t feel like I had much control over my own work. even with the writing I was actually doing I was so stretched and overworked that the quality wasn’t there. Eventually I felt I didn’t even have any control over my own identity.<p>Who is this Laura Lemay person who has her name all over all these books? Me, I think I’m an OK writer, I’m good at explaining stuff to people. Laura Lemay just produces huge numbers of not very good books.

Both sides thought each other were idiots.  We knew the market and the new guys had no experience with either web or the industry we were in.  We knew how to save money and generate profit and they knew how to spend it.<p>Within 2 years there were at least 8 VPs in a 40-person company (only about 20 of them worked full-time onsite).

They may not understand the sales process, they may not understand the considered risk you took when you sold that feature YOU KNOW you didn't have even though clinching that deal was strategically essential.<p>Therefore you really need to ensure that you communicate effectively and listen to them effectively. Most mis-placed anger is just a massive misunderstanding. 
You can also mitigate this by having a reference in their development-sphere who backs you up if your decisions are brought into doubt (which you need in companies that are so large that you don't have the time to give to them).<p>- How can I best approach a software engineer with an idea?<p>Slow the fuck down. I mean sure build it up a bit but don't pile on the features, it needs to be a challenge but business types seem to be very good at talking about a huge number of features which makes projects sound like death marches. Work on the core principles of the project and leave the star-gazing out of the initial conversation.<p>Oh and have a plan and some work done that looks like work.

It also seems like the amplitude of the sine wave is going to need to increase, based on the distance from the penny, to cause grosser adjustments to the penny.  I'm assuming that because in the opposite case, when the penny is close to the electromagnet, it seems like you will only need to make small adjustments to keep the penny a specific distance.  I assume the relationship between distance and the amplitude of the sine wave will be non-linear, which will determine the maximum distance the penny could ever be.<p>Here is a specific question: how do I determine the force of attraction between the penny and the electromagnet given the distance and the voltage of the magnet?<p>This is still in the earliest stages, so any advice at all will be appreciated!",1255022483

However money is often not the major motivator as you mentioned.</i><p>I might have explained myself poorly, but I disagree here. I'm saying that if money (long term) is the motivator they should go for whoever offers the biggest royalty rate. As I showed, if PragProg published my book, I'd have earned the same with 2000 copies as I did at Apress with 8500 copies (or thereabouts) :)<p><i>Sure they'll give up royalties but they will receive what they want. Small and medium-sized publishers will generally not have the resources and expertise to perform those same functions at the scale a big publishing house can do them.</i><p>Not always. I think the Pragmatic Programmers do an incredible PR job - especially as they have a PR umbilical cord with O'Reilly. Apress, on the other hand, shut down their entire Berkeley marketing department recently (and lost some great people).<p><i>Your case of selling 8500 copies through Apress vs. 2000 through Pragmatic Programmer is important since some might perceive that the book was a failure because it ""only"" sold 2,000 copies. And those ""some people"" might include potential employers, industry colleagues or the author.</i><p>But.. most authors don't publicly disclose their sales. There are quite a few other Ruby books published at Apress and I'd be interested to know how they've sold.. ;-) There are ways to get rough figures but they're as accurate as using Compete for Web stats (IME).<p><i>It also does not take into account the perceived prestige someone might feel with being accepted to be an Apress author vs. a PP author (again ""some people"" might have never heard of PP books and so it might not have the same weight).</i><p>In my limited experience, and especially amongst the Ruby world, I'd argue being a PP author has more prestige than being an Apress author - perhaps only trumped by being an O'Reilly author.. I know this isn't your point though ;-)<p><i>Apress starts to take notice and they hire someone to write the Beginning Ruby book for them and they market the shit out of it. What do you do now? You l-o-s-e, that's what. PP can't afford to market your book - they don't have any budget left after your 50% royalty and paying their staff - so you are SOL.</i><p>You make some good points in this paragraph but I don't think they apply for <i>me</i> or my market - though they might in other situations. There are other introductory Ruby books from more popular publishers out there but mine still outsells them - and this isn't because Apress is doing a great marketing job.",1255021793

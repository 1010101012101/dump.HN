These jobs revolve around the invention of novel algorithms, research into theory, and so on, sometimes without even having a practical application in mind. The work product is often papers, but is also sometimes new languages or proofs of concept.<p>Software engineering jobs tend to be what you see in &quot;senior developer&quot; positions in industry. They&#x27;re about applying known  concepts (i.e., existing languages, implementations of approaches from the literature, and so on) to build a defined system in sometimes-novel ways. The work output is usually a product or service that you have some degree of responsibility for.<p>Software as a trade is what most junior programmers and general employees at larger companies do. This is the application of very specific learned skills to implement pre-solved problems (i.e., a ticket to &quot;make X work like Y using Z method&quot;). The final product is closed tickets / implemented features.<p>And still another large group of &quot;programming&quot; jobs are actually more about knowing the problem than the solution. These are really jobs about using programming to do something else. Process and product optimization as well as a lot of engineering support jobs fall into this category. The work product is an improved process or system that happens to use a computer.<p>You can learn in <i>any</i> of these jobs. In the science job, you learn the fundamentals and then think of advancements to the field. In the engineering job, you study the fundamentals to apply them to solving a problem. In the trade job, you build the biggest possible toolbox of code to apply to each solution you&#x27;re given to implement. And in the non-programming job you learn a whole new field and then apply code to it.<p>All of these jobs can be lucrative, fulfilling, educational, and fun, but you need to know which one you&#x27;re getting into ahead of time. &quot;Programming&quot; and &quot;industry setting&quot; are awfully vague and useless terms.",1425934792

9174019,comment,9172048,9173076,0,0,deeviant,,,"Well, first of all, just to clarify, I was asking a question, not a statement. I recently ordered a HPC server for my company, we&#x27;re using caffe to train/detect very large sets.<p>I went with the K80, the company we ordered it from charged us $4400 for the card, so there must be a good amount of markup that can be negotiated out of it.<p>I have since read some material comparing the K40 to the 980, giving a slight edge to the 980, which is surprising considering the price points, but I have not yet found any good benchmarks/posts about the K80 vs the 980. The K80 is <i>not</i> just two K40&#x27;s glued together, as it uses the GK210 tesla chips rather than the GK110.  The GK210 is a more advanced chip with more cache and better energy efficiency but I&#x27;m really not too sure how it translate into real world performance.<p>If anybody has any data or perspective on this, I would appreciate it.",1425934762

And one of those is that a BigCo generally gets what it wants in terms of NDAs, within reason, before it opens up.<p>But if OP&#x27;s investor purports to be a &quot;real&quot; investor (financial and serial) then there are serious yellow/red flags.<p>(A &quot;real&quot; investor is one who is financially motivated but also has interest in doing several deals in the community into the future -- hence, they have a reputation to protect and they will tend to hew closer to market norms.)<p>From the VC perspective, if I had a good customer lead (in my portfolio or otherwise) for a new application of an unfunded startup&#x27;s technology, I would unhesitatingly make the intro.  It benefits me several ways: 1. it may help the customer; 2. seeing how the customer responds is extra diligence information to help me form an investment perspective; 3. if it works out, I am viewed favorably by the startup and more likely to have my term sheet accepted going forward.  (This is not speculation; in fact, I am a VC and we do this sort of thing all the time.)<p>It would be a strange situation, indeed, where I would feel the need to forgo those benefits because of needing an NDA.<p>(Now, if it&#x27;s the end customer who wants the NDA, then the normal &quot;commercial relationship&quot; rules, above, apply.)",1425934719

9174007,comment,9165614,9172001,0,0,pjmlp,,,"> But the whole idea that any high level language could be even close to competitive with assembly was a very radical idea considered laughable by the mainstream, for many years, which I think is the underlying idea here.<p>From the papers I used to dig during my degree, I would assume Algol derivatives were already quite competitive, given that quite a few OS were implemented in them.<p>> I wasn&#x27;t a Turbo Pascal user, but wasn&#x27;t it, too, tied to the one platform?<p>Yes, to the PC. I eventually moved into C++ as time came to move along to more portable languages, as C was too primitive for my taste and I had just got hold of Turbo C++.<p>> Wirth&#x27;s languages after Pascal, I dunno; everyone heard of them but they were never that widely adopted. I guess I&#x27;m unclear on why.<p>I was lucky to discover Oberon, and to use the Native PC version.<p>It opened my eyes that is it possible to have workstation OS done in GC enabled systems programming languages.<p>It also made me research Modula-3, Component Pascal, Oberon-2 and Active Oberon.<p>Coming back to the original point, back when coding for home computers, if performance was an issue, Assembly was the only option (Z80, 68000, x86).<p>For me, C was something I would see mentioned in some computer magazines about those new expensive UNIX workstations.",1425934635

You pay about $11 a week for a EC2, which is quite good once you compare it against the electricity costs that come on top of running a personal computer.<p>The downside is that you have a slow EC2 GPU with 4 GB RAM. Conv nets that take 3 weeks on a EC2, will take less than 2 weeks on a GTX980. If you run large conv nets, the 4 GB can be limiting (for example on ImageNet or similarly sized data sets).<p>Another point is that is more convenient to work on your own desktop and you can run multi-GPU nets, which is not possible on EC2 because the virtualization kills the memory bandwidth between GPUs.<p>If you think about it, over the long term a personal system will just be more cost efficient (you can keep a good system for years). So for deep learning researcher and those that apply deep learning this is just the most cost effective option.<p>A example calculation: You can buy a faster system than a EC2 for roughly $400 (GTX 580 + other parts from eBay). Together with electricity costs thats about 1 year worth of EC2, or 2 years worth if you use deep learning sporadically. A high end deep learning system will be about $1000-1400, which is about 3 years worth of EC2. So a EC2 makes good sense, if you use deep learning only sporadically and work with small data sets. If you use deep learning heavily, want a faster system or want to use multiple GPUs, a personal system will be better.",1425933882

I&#x27;ve never hired someone based on their undergraduate major; I rarely know what they are. The skills imparted by an undergraduate educational institution are very valuable, but not directly applicable to professional work, and that even applies to graduate schools such as law, for example -- no law firm cares what classes you took or believes those skills qualify you to do that kind of work; they care you learned to write, think, and work like an attorney well enough to apprentice you to a real one. Professional learning, in every field I can think of, starts with your first job as an apprentice. Most fields consider a graduate degree to be the minimum serious credential.<p>And after a few years in the professional world, nobody even considers your undergraduate major. Name your co-workers&#x27; or any tech leaders&#x27;. Does anyone mention it in their HN profile? Could you imagine being asked about it in an interview?<p>> Can you get well-rounded on your own? Depends. If you only read what people in your bubble tell you to, maybe not so much. Having someone else curate things for you to read, reflect on, discuss, and do has great value in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;d take it much further. I think people underestimate the value of a college environment. You get a cirriculum designed by an expert in the field, and then their personal tutoring. You are surrounded by resources unmatched elsewhere, from research libraries, to a room full of peers, to labs (if applicable), to a department full of experts available to talk to you. Want to learn about a subject? Try going to the office hours of a professor who spent their life studying it, and see if they have time for you. How do you even know which books to read?

What I would do in that instance is get a feel for their product and what their market is, and in the pitch relate everything to graphs of what their trajectory might look like and what their trajectory could be using your technology.  Show the curve of their current growth and a curve that breaks up much sooner which represents what their growth rate <i>could</i> be.  Back that up with data and solutions about how you&#x27;re going to increase their revenue.<p>I think what impresses non-technologists the most is if you have a full and utter grasp of their <i>business</i>, not just their product offerings.  You can show great prescience if you can thoroughly research their products and say things like &quot;I bet your customers have said that they wish they had x feature&quot;, or &quot;Have you considered y alternate method to monetizing your core product?&quot;.  Chances are, all the ideas you toss out they will have thought of, but it will show that you&#x27;re in the business of helping them get to business solutions and not just build them some cool software.  This will make them feel like you&#x27;re on their team, and greatly increase the chance of landing a contract.<p>Consequently, if you find this part to be difficult (extracting the core business that someone is in from their product offerings) then it becomes more and more difficult to pitch technology solutions, since you&#x27;re basically missing the whole point of their company and just attacking their pain points from the outside->in.

I expect several people in my family will try this out.<p>Off the top of my head, some challenges:<p><i>Insurance</i> Equipment can be rendered unusable in so many ways. It&#x27;s not even in the same ballpark as an Airbnb guest ruining the carpet. You&#x27;ve <i>got</i> to have insurance for this. Who pays? How much? Does anyone even want to offer insurance to this market? The &quot;About&quot; page mentions verification, which in theory might reduce EquipmentShare&#x27;s risk, but I wonder. It <i>won&#x27;t</i> be the same as insurance sold to existing rental companies. I doubt that a standard contractor&#x27;s worksite insurance plan covers this either.<p><i>Maintenance</i> Most of the equipment pictured on the website requires <i>daily</i> maintenance by a qualified operator or mechanic. Sure, the interval gets stretched, but that&#x27;s usually by the owner or her agents, so they get what&#x27;s coming to them. I understand that this is the primary headache for equipment rental places, but they are better able to deal with it than an individual contractor would be, and typically they know their customers pretty well before they e.g. rent a Bobcat for a month.<p><i>Mobilization</i> If it fits in the back of a pickup, this probably won&#x27;t be a problem. Lots of stuff doesn&#x27;t. Who is hauling the equipment? When? Is it a separate fee? Does the hauler have insurance that will cover the value of the equipment? (Is that the sort of thing that we should leave to reviews?)<p><i>Fees per what?</i> Lots of stuff is fine to rent by the day. If it has an engine, however, it&#x27;s often better to rent by the operating hour. If the lessee just wants to use something for an hour a day, however, minimum fees might be appropriate. This could get complex.<p><i>Find the right model for older equipment</i> With old enough heavy equipment, operating costs swamp equipment value. That is, if you have an old bulldozer sitting out in a field, it&#x27;s costing you nothing. (The capital is fully depreciated.) If you then use it for a month, you&#x27;re going to have to replace all the many filters a couple of times, run a couple of buckets of oil through it a day, fix all the dry-rotted hydraulic hoses, locate and repair some seals, replace both batteries, locate and fix clogged grease fittings, and then pray that nothing big like a pump or a turbo goes out. If this stuff is the lessor&#x27;s responsibility, the rental fee will need to be higher than one might expect. If it&#x27;s the lessee&#x27;s, it won&#x27;t get done, the machine will be ready for the scrapyard after a week, and one might expect lawsuits. The right model <i>might</i> be &quot;don&#x27;t allow old junk&quot;, but this is an area where this service can differentiate itself from existing equipment rental, so maybe not.<p>Actually now that I think about it, this service might be better for specialty tools like hammerdrills and scaffolding than it would be for motorized equipment like that pictured on the landing page. Fewer details, and less money on the line in case of disaster. One suggestion I would definitely make would be to sign up existing rental companies and equipment dealers (perhaps through a separate website if you don&#x27;t want to confuse contractors). They have a lot of existing inventory and will view this as another sales channel.",1425932821

9173751,comment,9170395,9170395,0,0,otakucode,,,"I have been doing something a bit related to this.  I&#x27;ve been approaching programming as teaching.  As I read books, I try to write code to accompany them.  If they have exercises, I write code that will solve them.  It certainly takes me to different challenges, things I don&#x27;t normally face when writing typical applications.  I especially enjoy doing this with completely non-computer-related textbooks, such as physics or chemistry books.  In teaching the computer how to do these things, I most definitely benefit in understanding the tasks better myself.<p>Of course, when I do this I face some common hurdles.  For instance, parsing whatever representation is used (equations or chemical formulas or whatever).  In an &#x27;interactive book&#x27; situation, I could see approaching an exercises section with a proper parser made available, so the &#x27;reader&#x27; could easily manipulate the important portions of the problem.  Other things come up too, such as using clumps of data.  Whether a list of atomic masses of a mole of an elements atoms or proportional relationships between various factors, those things ought also to be made available in easy-to-use data structures.<p>I could see the IPython Notebook environment growing in this direction easily.  People are already starting to use it as a platform for putting together entire books with a great deal of interactivity built in.  You execute the code as you &#x27;read&#x27; and see what it does step by step.  In my opinion it should replace any scientific papers presenting any sort of data analysis as soon as possible.  For whole-book projects, though, the platform needs some work.  And the creators are aware of this and intending to fix issues and add features to support this.  Read through their Issues page on Github sometime and you&#x27;ll see authors really pushing the bounds of what the Notebook format can do and developers responding.",1425932645

In industry, you typically learn more about business and current &quot;trends&quot; in technology, whereas in school you improve your fundamentals and have the opportunity to learn more hard skills, like machine learning, programming languages, etc.<p>I&#x27;d argue there is a lot more opportunity to learn in school than industry though, if only because you can go at your own rate in school so if you wanted to learn about current technology in school you could easily do so on your own. Still, I think a lot of it really boils down to having responsibilities that you are getting paid for vs not being paid but having the freedom to do what you want.<p>I certainly have learned a lot since leaving school, but the majority of it has not been due to being in industry but learned on my own time.",1425932303

The people who do these jobs are either undergrads who worked incredibly hard to pick up these skills or phd&#x27;s.<p>Can you elaborate? I am an undergrad and this sounds incredibly interesting. What are those skills? How do you pick up them?",1425931225

Premium hardware is nice, but if it is slowed down by bloatware and doesn&#x27;t get software updates or patches either it has a hard time to justify the price. Replacing a 80$ &quot;shitphone&quot; (I don&#x27;t like the term) every 2 years is easier to stomach than a 400$+ &quot;premium device&quot;.",1425931225

How will they achieve this ?<p>A large marketing budget helps, e.g. see the video they launched with. Making it easy to use and frictionless would also help (no need to log into the website, no need to figure out how to sign a PDF or download a consent form or whatever the normal user flow is).<p>What concerns me is people gaming the apps; downloading them and filling them with fake data just to be malicious.

Hardware wise, this thing is a cell phone with a really nice screen, a full size keyboard and a gigantic battery. Could they have made the battery a little bit bigger? Probably, but I&#x27;m sure they have detailed metrics on how often people charge their laptops. Apple doesn&#x27;t strike me as the type of company to make arbitrary design decisions. Hate them all you want, but they don&#x27;t do things without research.<p>And Apple laptops already give really good battery life: my 2014 retina MBP gets 6+ hours on a full charge -- and that&#x27;s while running VMWare Fusion with 2-3 VMs. I have yet to see a Windows laptop give anywhere close to that battery life under that type of load without a bulbous battery pack protruding from the back.",1425931208

Sure, they bump it on the $1,600$ model, but  by then not having ~512 seems silly.<p>PS: You can get a 512GB desktop SSD drive for under 180$ so cost wise it&#x27;s a non issue.  And 30$ micro SD cards are at 64GB so 512GB would not be a space issue.",1425931202

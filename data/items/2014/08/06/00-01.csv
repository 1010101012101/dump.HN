8140407,comment,8138227,8139927,1,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;d like google to stop making the GUI worse and start making it better.<p>For example, I like subscribing to various channels, but hell if I can figure out what shows I&#x27;ve missed from day to day. What I want<p>1) Click &quot;play from subscriptions&quot;, start playing all the videos I&#x27;ve missed. If I&#x27;m in my living room, I&#x27;d like this to basically be my personal TV station. I&#x27;d like to focus it down to just play from one of my collections at a time if I want to since I&#x27;ve spent lots of time collecting my subscriptions into collections in the first place. If I get to a video I don&#x27;t care to watch, I like to hit something like &quot;skip&quot; and just move onto the next one.<p>2) If I finish that or get bored, have a &quot;find new channels&quot; page.<p>Here&#x27;s what actually happens:<p>1) Go to www.youtube.com shown &quot;what to watch&quot;. I have zero interested in the recommended list.<p>2) Scrolls down, I see videos from 1 channel I&#x27;ve subscribed to. What are these videos? New? Old? Repeats? ones I&#x27;ve missed? It doesn&#x27;t matter because I can&#x27;t even just start playing the list. I have to click on one that looks interesting, watch it, then go back, click the next one, repeat until I&#x27;m irritated and don&#x27;t want to come back.<p>3) Scrolling down more some of my channels have lists that scroll off to the right, some only have two or three videos, why? If I go to some of those channels, there&#x27;s dozens of videos I haven&#x27;t watched, why am I presented with these ones and not the others?<p>4) The 3rd &quot;channel&quot; in my list is one I&#x27;m not subscribed to and couldn&#x27;t possibly have less interest in.<p>5) I&#x27;ve also categorized my subscriptions into different interest areas. But this &quot;what to watch&quot; list is just a mish-mash of stuff seemingly randomly selected from all of them. I have no way to narrow down or select all or some of the channels from one of my categories.<p>&quot;What to Watch&quot; is useless to me.<p>So there&#x27;s a &quot;My Subscriptions&quot; section I can switch to.<p>1) It&#x27;s set to &quot;All Activity&quot; so I see all the random stuff the people who own the channels I&#x27;m subscribed to are doing. Which I supremely don&#x27;t care about in the least.<p>2) I switch to &quot;Uploads Only&quot;<p>3) Now I have a list of seemingly random videos selected from all of my channels. Still no option to &quot;start playing&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if these are new, old, unwatched, watched, missed or some other category of video. Google just appears to have populated my list completely at random.<p>4) This list is dominated by a couple high-volume special interest channels I&#x27;m subscribed to for easy access, but really don&#x27;t care to see every single 20 second video they upload. I have them collected into a special interested collection, but there&#x27;s no way to select just the special interest I want to watch at this moment.<p>5) When I hover over a video in this list, there&#x27;s a hamburger menu, one of the options is helpfully titles &quot;hide these videos&quot;. I click it to hopefully suppress these high-volume videos. It hides one video, not all of them. When I reload, it shows up again anyways.<p>6) There&#x27;s an option to only show uploads from the specific channel, but I could do that just by going to the channel in the first place.<p>There&#x27;s a permanent Hamburger menu at the top, maybe what I want to do is there?<p>Among lots of useless garbage, most of it duplicating what I&#x27;m already looking at, I see my subscription collections. Perhaps if I click on one of those I can filter down to just my interest area.<p>Okay, that seems to work. Now where&#x27;s my &quot;play all&quot; button? How about &quot;play since all new&quot; or &quot;play all since last visit&quot;. Or whatever. The list I&#x27;m presented with is the same kind of mysteriously populated list of random stuff I saw before, but at least it&#x27;s focused onto a topic I care about.<p>In the mean time, at every opportunity, I get hit with countless recommendations to subscribe to more. But to be honest, what&#x27;s the point? Youtube tries to kill all the value from subscribing to channels.<p>Also, the terminology is all wrong! I&#x27;m really subscribing to &quot;shows&quot; and collections should be more like &quot;channels&quot;. I should be able to just &quot;play channel&quot; and have it start cycling through all the &quot;shows&quot; I&#x27;ve subscribed to.<p>It&#x27;s gotten worse and worse. I used to really watch lots of content on youtube, and now I barely due because Google has managed to squash almost all of the value of what I&#x27;ve subscribed to and constantly inundates me with irrelevant bullshit I&#x27;m absolutely not interested in.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely terrible, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be.",1407286795

After this multiplication, the first 4 bytes and the last 4 bytes of &#x27;key&#x27; are nonzero.  E.g. a key of 1 will yield 0x27BB2EE687B0B0FE, a key of 2 will yield 0x4F765DCD0F6161FB, etc.  (The fact that the first 4 bytes become nonzero is important for the next step.)<p>Step 2:<p><pre><code>      double(1LL << 31) / double((key >> 33) + 1)  \n</code></pre>\nThe lower 33 bits of &#x27;key&#x27; are discarded, then 1 is added.<p>In order to understand what can happen, let&#x27;s examine extreme inputs.<p>If key is 0, the denominator will be 1, and the result will be (double)0x80000000, which can be represented exactly.

It&#x27;s a uint64_t, and its value is always less than &#x27;num_buckets&#x27; due to the nature of the while loop.<p>&#x27;num_buckets&#x27; is an int32_t, so its max value is 0x7FFFFFFF.<p>The result from step 2 has a maximum possible value of (double)0x80000000 and a minimum possible value of 1.0.<p>(b + 1) is promoted to a double, which is then multiplied with step 2&#x27;s result.<p>Since all of the following conditions are true...<p>- step 2&#x27;s result has a max value of 0x80000000<p>- the final result must be less than &#x27;num_buckets&#x27; to continue iterating<p>- the final result is less than 2^53 (the maximum integer that can be exactly represented by a 64-bit float)<p>- each iteration of the loop quantizes the final result from a 64-bit float to a 64-bit integer (by storing it into the variable &#x27;j&#x27;), preventing error from accumulating<p>... then it must be true that this floating point arithmetic will always yield consistent results.  It can&#x27;t matter which compiler you use or which optimization level / strictness settings you choose.<p>(It&#x27;s probably possible to trim this proof down, but since it gets the job done, I&#x27;m just going to post it as-is.)<p>EDIT:  In fact, I&#x27;m pretty sure that the algorithm would still produce consistent results even if it tried to store integers larger than 2^53 into a 64-bit float.  Even though that would be out of range, the truncation would still be consistent.<p>The reason why it&#x27;s consistent is because at each iteration of the loop, it quantizes the intermediate 64-bit float result into a 64-bit integer, essentially flooring the result.  This prevents small floating point errors from carrying over into the next iteration.  A secondary reason why it&#x27;s consistent is because the actual values being divided and multiplied are very small (less than 0x80000000).  For small integers x and y, it seems like (uint64_t)((double)x / (double)y) will always truncate consistently regardless of compiler variation or floating point optimization settings.<p>Maybe (uint64_t)((double)x / (double)y) will always yield a consistent result regardless of compiler or optimization settings, even if x and y aren&#x27;t small.  But I&#x27;m definitely sure that (uint64_t)(9.0/5.0) will always result in 1, and (uint_64)t)(11.0/5.0) will always result in 2, etc, and in that case, x and y are small.  So, since the max intermediate values are less than 0x80000000, it seems likely that there&#x27;s no numerator/denominator combination that could cause inconsistent results if you switch compilers or float optimization settings, as long as numerator > denominator.",1407286392

8140372,comment,8138578,8139687,1,0,pron,,,"I think you&#x27;re attacking a straw man by very narrowly defining &quot;imperative programming&quot;. Wikipedia says imperative programming is &quot;a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state&quot; (this is as opposed to <i>declarative programming</i>, BTW, and not not functional programming, which has no accepted definition at all). There is nothing in there saying that state has to be shared, or if it is, whether or not it can have transactional semantics. Using shared, mutable state with transactional semantics in an imperative style has none of the problems you mentioned; neither does non-shared mutable state, which is just as much a cornerstone of imperative programming as shared state.<p>You&#x27;re also implying it is possible to program without shared mutable state. To the best of my knowledge, practically every interesting program (other than compilers) has shared mutable state (yes, even Haskell programs), even if it is delegated to a database (which, of course, also has to be concurrent, and has to be programmed by someone).<p>Now, the quest for a true general purpose STM has been abandoned, but more domain-specific forms (or even in-memory databases, which are, essentially, STM) are still very much in the game.",1407286196

Even at the most advanced startups I&#x27;ve seen up close, more of the software is built using custom frameworks than using &quot;cutting-edge&quot; modern frameworks. Adopting each new modern framework has a cost, and if a startup&#x27;s problems are largely orthogonal to the problems the framework solves, adopting the framework is unjustified. I can remember only one job interview where extensive Rails experience was a hard requirement, but it was probably because the company&#x27;s founding team wanted help learning Rails. You should be able to find many jobs where experience with modern frameworks is not a hard requirement.<p>If I were in your situation, I&#x27;d do two things. First, I&#x27;d write a list of 10 ideas to make my career really fun. This list would probably describe companies to interview at and projects to pursue. Second, I&#x27;d write a list of 10 ideas to make my current job really fun. This might require some extreme creativity, but it might be better to make a possibly futile attempt to enjoy the current job while working on finding the next one than continue to waste away in misery.<p>Here are a few crazy ideas that come to mind. Your ideas will be better:<p>1. Make a bingo board where each square is a common annoyance you encounter in the code. Share combinations of the bingo board with your co-workers. Give a candy bar to whomever gets bingo first.<p>2. When faced with an annoying task, set a countdown timer and do everything you can to finish the task before the time runs out. Don&#x27;t let the bomb explode.<p>3. Stand up and do a fist pump every time you make an especially clever commit.<p>4. Listen to music that is fun.<p>5. Periodically listen to comedy that makes you laugh.<p>6. Think of the people you admire or respect in your workplace. Try to meet with them and learn from them. Give back to them too - perhaps by giving them ideas that you think could possibly help them in their projects, or introduce them to people you know who could help them.<p>7. Bring in snacks or some particularly tasty treats to share with your co-workers. It might help build some emotional connection and friendship.<p>8. Bring a bag of M&Ms and eat one every time you save a file.<p>9. Try working for an hour using only one hand.<p>10. If you&#x27;re in an office setting where talking out loud won&#x27;t bother other people, try narrating everything you do during the work day like how YouTube stars narrate playing video games. An immensely talented engineer I knew at an internship would sing rap lyrics all morning and swear vigorously at his machine when things went badly wrong.

Data can usually still be localized to the routines that use it without throwing it in the global scope. The inherent problem of two threads sharing data is also something that will _have to_ be dealt with on some layer of the implementation if you want the threads to communicate, regardless of programming paradigm. Some languages provide really nice abstractions to deal with this in ways that don&#x27;t explicitly have the programmers invoke locks. Among imperative languages, Go provides a really useful and sensible such abstraction with channels.<p><i>> In concurrent programming, you are opening the doors to this type of problem: and what is worse is that shared variable x can change at any time, not over some predictable action like calling a function. When you assign 42 to x, x could turn into 43 even before control passes out of the assignment statement and to the next statement.</i><p>Still nitpicking, but you should separate the concerns of parallel programming that don&#x27;t necessarily have anything to do with concurrent programming.

8140241,comment,8139137,8139137,5,0,scoofy,,,"Before my wall of text, i first understand the difficulties of network effects, getting credit cards accepted world wide, much less state wide, but i think with the advent of square, stripe, paypal, etc. the barriers to launch are much lower than they were even 5 years ago. I&#x27;m sick of banks trying to squeeze every last drop out of the customers, and i&#x27;d gladly pay for a banking service rather than be the product it&#x27;s selling.<p>Credit cards are surviving in the stone age, firms would rather make it easy for you to get yourself in debt that to provide a service that prevents fraud and abuse. So, VC people out there. If you want to make a billion dollars, you should start a bank. People who work for the credit card community, there are simple upgrades that would make life a lot safer.<p>Simple upgrades to make security safer:<p>Chip and pin is low hanging fruit in the US. The fact that most americas have no idea what those threes words mean is an international embarrassment.<p>READ ONLY passwords for bank account information, in addition to different read write options, that have an extra level of security. I&#x27;d gladly use services like Mint, except i&#x27;d rather not give write power to anyone except me and a browser i only user for banking only at home.<p>Tie credit cards to cell phones. Get a text after EVERY purchase (this would honestly not amount to more than 10 or so texts per day). Have this as opt-out, not opt-in. Yes, i would use this, yes it would effectively stunt any fraud. You would not have to respond to the text at all, however, if you suspect fraud, you can immediately cancel the card.<p>Voice recognition for phone calls. When you take out a card, you are require to read a paragraph or two, and upload, or mail in a recording of your voice. This could immediately alleviate much of the phone security nonsense that i deal with when i&#x27;m on the phone. It&#x27;s not a cure all for passwords, but it&#x27;s certainly an additional level of security.<p>IP zones for online credit card purchases. I know about five 100 mile radii that i will be making an online purchase from. Add an extra level of security for any time i&#x27;m outside of that.<p>As far as credit agencies are concerned, there is a serious issue with quasi-oligopoly situations there. Extremely difficult to disrupt, but developing secure credit vehicles could create incentives for the current oligopoly in credit cards to improve security for their own cards.<p>At the end of the day, i&#x27;m more than willing to admit that people themselves are a big part of the problem. Example: a year ago, watching a man freak out on an apple store employee when he would not give a computer to him, that apparently belonged to his son, who gave it to the apple store a week earlier. The son apparently signed off that only he could receive the computer, and only in person. The enraged father was rambling on about how insane it was that they would not surrender the computer to him, and how he would never use apple products again. I wish there were profitable business models for people who actually like following the rules and read the contracts they sign.<p>tl;dr: I don&#x27;t want a credit card that makes it easy for me to spend money. I have cash for that. Give me a credit card that makes me feel safe entering the number into any website, and i&#x27;ll gladly pay a premium for it.",1407283443

Maybe computers will be modeled on the brain with billions, maybe trillions, of cores (neurons) and trillions of interconnects.  We wont be using arc, java, or even python to program them.

471352,comment,471207,471309,0,0,jaxn,,,"You hit the million dollar question.<p>The problem is that the ""subscriber count"" metric is bullshit.<p>First I will explain what that count is. Then I explain what we think people want from the subscriber count and how we are working to address that need.<p>The subscribe count is based on the feed reading tool and the IP address (if it is a desktop client like NetNewsWire or FeedDemon). FeedBurner has explained a fair amount about this number and this post provides some good background (<a href=""http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2006/09/a_peek_inside_techcrunchs_100k.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2006/09/a_pe...</a>).<p>The problem is that ""subscriber"" is supposed to equate to ""person"", but it does not. In email marketing this works because we have a person identifier (the email address). There is no similar identifier for feed. What that means is that out of TechCrunch's 100,000 subscribers, I as an individual represent 5+ subscribers (once on Google Reader, once on bloglines, once on NewsGator, once with NetNewsWire at home, once at NetNewsWire at work). I am a pretty typical TechCrunch subscriber so it is possible the number of ""people"" is actually 20% of the number of ""subscribers"".<p>The converse is that many corporations and Universities have only 1 outgoing IP address. So all FeedDemon subscribers at Belmont University here in Nashville show up as 1 subscriber.<p>Why this is important is because of what people want the ""subscriber count"" to be. They want it to be an apples to apples comparison to compare popularity across blogs. It is just too inaccurate to be that measure.<p>We initially had this count and as we looked at the data we felt that it was inaccurate at best and sometimes completely misleading. This was the driving force in our decision to remove this feature. It is a risk, but I think it represents an intellectual honesty that our customers will appreciate.<p>The other reason people like the ""subscriber count"" metric is to measure growth and decline in their individual blog. This is why having the number fluctuate so wildly in FeedBurner is so frustrating.<p>We have not solved the apples to apples comparison yet, but we have some promising progress.<p>As for measuring growth, once you break that out as a goal it is easy to see that there are other ways to answer this question.<p>As you said ""The fact that FeedBurner has such a struggle with accurate counts hurts their credibility"". Hopefully our willingness to find a better way, even if it may be perceived as a shortcoming in the short term, will help our credibility.<p>What do you think about our strategy here?

But to go from there to saying you don't deserve responsibility for what you've done is a grossly illogical step to take.<p>You could argue that Zappa did everything because of circumstance. You could make a good and utterly meaningless case because of that, that everything is responsible for everything. It's good because it's generic enough to be obvious; it's meaningless because if everything causes everything it's the same as nothing causing anything.<p>In Zappa's case particularly: I know of no other musician that learned music through modernist composers and then translated that into rock music, who started off playing drums in a small band, took control of that band, taught himself guitar and became a virtuoso, and produced 90 albums in about 30 years in every genre imaginable. Nobody even comes close in that regard, and nobody has ever done anything like it. So, who's responsible for that genius? The record stores, for selling albums that caught Zappa's eye? Zappa's parents, for letting him buy records? The band members who ducked out and let Zappa take control? Those aren't genius acts. The genius is the thing that Zappa provided that came from him and him alone.<p><i>Most historical genii I know of attribute their greatest work to something outside of them. Is there a good counter to this observation?</i><p>Shakespeare didn't. Joyce didn't. Beckett didn't. The author of my favorite novel, Daniel Handler, is quoted as saying something to the effect that the only sacred thing about his writings is that he took the time to revise them. Bach wrote <i>for</i> the church but I've never read something saying that he was merely writing for God. The attitude stated here, that genius comes from an outside force, is incredibly rare. I've never heard anybody who's made anything truly extraordinary crediting anybody but themselves. The act of creation requires ego above anything else.",1234029989

(OK, just kidding there!)<p>Secondly though net neutrality is immoral by Objectivist standards because it regulates free enterprise and crushes healthy competition. If my DSL from ISP 1 doesn't give me the bandwidth that a DSL from ISP 2 could give me, I have the consumer choice to switch to ISP 2. Ayn Rand would roll over in her grave at this notion of net neutrality which is pretty much close to socialism, because it ruins consumer choice and competition. If ISP 1 and 2 are forced to provide the same bandwidth then my consumer choice goes out the window, and if I am a shareholder for ISP 1 or 2 then my opportunity as a shareholder to profit from different DSL packages gets reduced to. This hurts the consumer by destroying competition and thus choice, and this hurts the shareholder by hurting profit potential by undue regulation.<p>Think about it this way, as Sen. Stevens of Alaska mentioned, the internet is like a series of tubes, with finite carrying capacity. I don't want to have to wait until Monday to get a video emailed to me on Friday because the government has forced my ISP to adhere to some arbitrary standard of how my ISP can utilize the tubes of the internet. No, I want my video on Friday, the same day it was emailed. I want the choice, the freedom, to choose an Internet Service Provider who can pick the biggest tube out there to use to send me my video. I do not want my ISP to be forced by the government to send me my video via a smaller tube, where it has to wait in line behind a bunch of other videos in that same tube. (Note: I am using the loose terminology here for clarity, but I actually work in tech as a software qa engineer with a background in unit testing and gui automation, I am A+ and Network+ certified, so I do understand what I am talking about, just to be clear.) I want the consumer freedom to have an ISP that chooses the biggest tube out there to send me my video and I don't want the government telling my ISP what tube to use. Period. Net neutrality hurts me as the consumer, and it hurts the shareholder. An ISP should be allowed to operate however it likes to provide value and choice to the consumer and profit for its shareholders, and big brother should not get in the way. Ayn Rand would be ashamed of this conversation. I hope for the sake of Western civilization that net neutrality is rejected, or else we will all be singing the Internationale before long.<p>I realize this might not be a popular sentiment, and I also realize my ""karma"" may be affected by it, but Ms. Rand would not let fear of karma reductions keep her from speaking out on behalf of truth, justice, and the American Way, and neither should I. :-)",1234029816

Ask them when in the past have they busted through the boring slog and what it was that motivated them to do so.<p>Or hey, do what most people with boring projects do: find someone who isn't (or doesn't know they are) great, and exploit them.

But honestrly, after trying this ubiquity for a while, i have difficulties finding it ""user-friendly"".<p>It's like calling a unix-shell ""user-friendly"" because with all commands, and pipes, and possibilities to combine them you can do everything. It's possible, sure, but who really can, besides like 1-2% of computer users ?<p>I get the same feeling from this thing. It's supposed to make you feel like you only ask your computer for something and it comes naturally, but basically, it's only typing a command to make an action. And the main flaw of it, is that words that are obvious to one person, are not to another.<p>And last point, I know, it's still alpha software, but not everyone does everything with their keyboard. I do, i'm quite a big fan of utilities like Launchy, for example, but most of people prefer to use a mouse for their actions, they want a flow of action, they want drag and drop.<p>Basically, this ubiquity, it's just a unix command line adapted to a browser, but i can't see that becoming very useful to most people.",1234029653

2830936,comment,2830659,2830659,2,0,Derbasti,,,"I have worked productively with quite a number of different toolchains. Among them\nwere full-blown IDEs that worked great (VS+VisualAssistX and Eclipse for C++, XCode for Obj-C), there were IDEs that worked less than great (VisualDSP, Matlab) and several combinations of dynamic languages and Emacs or Vim.<p>I feel that some languages/environments benefit more from IDE support than others. But in the end, whatever works well for you is a good tool. Bad tools however drain the life out of me and leave a hollow shell of a coding monkey. I hate working with inadequate software.<p>In general though, the text editing capabilities of Emacs and Vim blow anything else out of the water and make a huge difference to my productivity and enjoyment. IDEs often lack that (but there are usually plugins like ViEmu or VsVim that can make up for it). Another great thing to have is good autocompletion, which Vim in particular is not that good at (again, plugins can help). Lastly, refactoring tools are a nice time-saver, even though a comparatively rarely used one. This is where IDEs usually have an edge.<p>Taken as a whole though, my enjoyment usually peaks when I feel powerful. With Emacs or Vim, you sometimes feel like a code surgeon, slicing and dicing code as if by magic. THAT, is cool. It is an experience that IDEs have a hard time to make up for. Also, the customizability of Emacs an Vim allows you to discover new stuff whenever you want, which is a great thing that avoid becoming bored of your tools. So in the end I guess I concur with the author in that I prefer simple tools to those slick IDEs.",1312177799

What this is doing is taking the ""success rate"" (which is whatever you want to make it be) and assuming that it works as a forward-looking probability.<p>In reality, the growth rate is likely to be higher for many people due to learning and the relatedness of successive ventures. There are also likely to be limiting factors which scale more rapidly than experience increases the probability of success - you're not likely to ever reach 83%.<p>But keeping in mind that it is a generalized approximation, the conclusion of the first-order model is still good.<p>* Start early, there are no ideal conditions.<p>* Evaluate often, if you don't do anything that can fail then you are likely over-invested in the single attempt.",1312177228

The government gets less money from you, and you personally spend an amount of time on something that could be much better spent /generating/ or spending capital.<p>I honestly think governments should remove all deductions and just charge a lower tax rate. I know it is an economic tool to get people to do or buy certain things but income tax deductions really add very little value to the economy and waste people's time. Note, that I am talking about income tax deductions, deductions can be put on other taxes to encourage purchasing but then it is your choice to buy it or not and the gain is immediate instead of at tax time.",1312175386

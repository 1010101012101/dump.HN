ANY social news site that is full-featured and doesn't censor its users will almost invariably start out great then begin it fail as more people find out about it.",1208389950

I gotta admit, I almost certainly would pay for that (although it's almost completely hypothetical since paying for it goes completely against the entire philosophy of the service, and if it had always been a pay service, it wouldn't be as extensive).",1208389825
165790,comment,165621,165621,0,0,baddox,,,"The problem with this question is, when you think about it, one big reason all the popular free web services ARE popular is because they're free.  So pretty much my answer to any of the sites I use would be, I might be willing to pay if I couldn't find an alternative, yet at the same time, I'd probably never be using any of them in the first place if they weren't originally free.  However, I would NEVER pay for social news/discussion sites like this one (or digg, reddit, etc.).  Regardless of the quality of the stories and discussion, social news sites are services I only use in my leisure time, I would probably not visit them if I didn't have tons of spare time anyway.  No offense to social news sites, it's just that I wouldn't pay for them.",1208389739

165781,comment,165098,165536,0,0,scott_s,,,"Actually, I started out with Dive Into Python, because it was showing me <i>this is how to do it in Python</i>. I can already program in several languages (and paradigms), so I wanted to know what the idiomatic Python way is.<p>By doing that, I absorbed some of the important languages concepts and capabilities. I find that I learn best by example; show me what a correct solution looks like, and I'll figure out why it's correct, and hopefully generalize that to the whole language.<p>Once I started doing some Python programming, I jumped to mostly using the online library and language documentation.<p>Disclaimer: I still haven't used Python extensively, but I feel comfortable when I use it.",1208389300

Learning the STL requires learning more concepts, but this is true of all higher-level features. You get out what you put in.<p>Further, I'm mystified why you said learning the STL is premature optimization, and then further advocated premature optimization regarding memory allocation. I don't see how learning the STL is a premature optimization. As for your performance problem, STL containers can take a custom allocator as a template parameter.",1208388377

The lack of general resources, made people and families to be much more connected, as you had to rely more on your family (not just the inner circile, but everybody, from uncles, aunts, third cousins, etc).<p>When comunism fell, some people started making more money, getting new cars, houses on the beach, while some were left with less,  which obviously made them unhapier.  They might be slightly better off than in comunism, but they were much worse than their peers.<p>Well, accoding to Kant's principles, is the extra hapinness gained by those that made it well, worth equal or more than the happiness lost by those that are faring less well?  It is a very hard thing to quantify.<p>But even in the 80s, we could watch Italian TV, so we kinda new that the rest of the world was doing much better, (and eventually overthru our comunist goverment),  BUT everybody around us was doing about the same.<p>My mom told me a while ago;  well we are doing much better economically (as a family), and have a lot more now,  BUT we seemed to be a lot happier back than.",1208386854

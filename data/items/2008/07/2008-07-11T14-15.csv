But if you send her to the homepage and she can't figure it out, I think thats a great focus group. If she's not technical (obviously, I don't know your mom) and she thinks its a breeze, you've done an incredible job. I won't say more, since having conversations about people's mothers never seem to turn out good, but in this case, I think it would be great to see how your mom uses it. Note that I said ""how she uses it,"" not if she likes it. Of course your mom will like it :) Er, hopefully.",1215787922

I am not interested in both, but I do bother if some company gets funded, if some website gets bought or if someone writes a 'hello world' app in a hundred languages. I don't have the same interests as Tom or Harry. And featuring their likes on my headlines just because they clicked doesn't make an uber-cool feature or a handy tool. To me, it just sounds like a bad automated-Digg clone.<p>This is totally a commercial idea. They seem to be interested in the clicks and henceforth the dollars. The idea would have been a runaway hit if they tried to personalize news as per personal interests.<p>Well, this system cannot personalize news until they ask me to specify my interests and tweak the news personally for me.
 It can be done with a Yahoo Pipes app ofcourse. But its still like using a calculator for 3+4. How about a direct feature - ""personalize ur news"".<p>One way to read such news is to use the Google News Search RSS feeds. It works for me.<p>I mentioned just a few days back, that I was working on a news engine - for news analysis and news search (it's for a contest and I'm working on it since I am a news buff). The idea is currently half complete since I have my exams on(will be over by 15th of this month). I found a simple way to personalize news :)
I just gave the idea a try and it does seem to be crappy, but its an easier way because that's the simplest data I have access to as a developer. Will post it here soon.

It would be crazy to think that management broke fiduciary duty here (as the article implies, with the references to legislatures/taxpayers).<p>It was twenty years before GM saw competition from the Japanese (in the wake of the oil crisis), and it's hard for us to see six months out in our own companies.  Any rational shareholder, were they so smart, could have dumped GM in 1973.  And, really, 1950 to now is two whole generations (generally defined as 30 years).  Fiduciary duty means a ""reasonable person"" standard.  While, yes, it would have been better now if they had the government take on these obligations then, it's clearly not unreasonable for GM to have decided otherwise.<p>Second, and more interestingly to me, is that it was in GM's <i>interest</i> to bear health care costs.  GM needed to attract and retain skilled labor (which is why they compensated them so well in the Treaty of Detroit).  Bearing healthcare costs, as a flush company with two full decades of prosperity ahead of it, provided a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining labor versus other fields that these workers could have gone into, such as plumbing, construction, or the like.<p>I'll leave the historical nature of the Big Three's political biases to others.",1215786367

578426,comment,577557,577557,0,0,joe_bleau,,,"My Koh-I-Noor was a 0.5mm Rapidomatic 5635, white plastic barrel.  Great pencil, until the barrel broke.  I replaced it was a Rotring (probably the 600, although I'm not exactly sure), sold by Levenger under their name.  (The clip is stamped Rotring, though).  It's very nice, solid brass, and easily as good as my (plastic) Koh-I-Noor.<p>I've had a few other very nice pencils.  Less technical is the Pentel Kerry (<a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/45_356"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/45_356</a>) --everyone should own one.  The Ohto Tasche (<a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/45_131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/45_131</a>) is almost as nice.<p>The Pentel Graphgear 1000 (<a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/340_118"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/340_118</a>) is good drafting pencil, but not quite as 'dense' as the Rotring.  It has a decent retractable sleeve, which might give it just a bit more wiggle.  I also have a Ohto Promecha 1000 (<a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/340_154_659"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/340_154_659</a>) and Super Promecha 1500 (<a href=""http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/340_154_663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/cPath/340_154_663</a>), but to me they seem to be more about trickery than solid quality.

578420,comment,578292,578349,0,0,potatolicious,,,"IMHO the problem is not that developers don't want to rewrite their programs, it's that they don't want to <i>maintain</i> them, and don't want to <i>learn</i>.<p>There's no problem with letting old software stop running at some point, provided said period is long enough. The problem with Windows and its back-compat is that it supports more than legacy apps - many developers release <i>brand new applications</i> that still rely on long-deprecated API and technologies. This complicates back-compatibility, since removing API will now kill new apps instead of just the decade-old ones it's meant to target.<p>Developers need to get a lot less lazy - if the API says ""deprecated"", do NOT use it. Do <i>not</i> use undocumented calls... If people started programming instead of layering on hacks, this wouldn't be a large problem.",1240619884

Seriously?<p>If you are running a system with significant data churn (think: a Reuters news feed expiring at N days), Postgres is at a massive disadvantage if you're concerned with system throughput. Postgres 8.4's rewritten Free Space Map looks promising, but 8.4 was just announced in beta on 4/15/2009. In 8.3 or earlier, you can expect significant latency if ""VACUUM"" is going to touch any significant percentage of your table size.<p>Given sufficient data churn with a Postgres system in a processing pipeline, we can be talking about an hour or more for the ""VACUUM"" operation per evening. Yes, I speak from experience. The MySQL (5.0.45 InnoDB) systems downstream from these Postgres DBs have zero measurable latency due to space-recovery operations.",1240619351

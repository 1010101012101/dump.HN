2169229,comment,2168587,2169075,0,0,tkahn6,,,"> And PBS is decent, but it's mainly targeted at people 60+ and retired. Waiting until 7pm for news from last week just isn't viable for people who actually need to know what's going on.<p>I'm sorry that's just ridiculous. Not only do they have a website that's constantly updated, the news they present is timely according to the importance of the event. They usually have a mix of a) news that happened that day, b) follow up stories from events from the past few days or week and c) long term international news (Haitian recovery, Peru's economy, etc.). And then they have ~5-7 minute rundown of the headlines from that day. Recently they've been devoting almost the entire program to Egypt.<p>I seriously cannot understand HN's infatuation with Al Jazeera English. It's simply a more sophisticated version of CNN or BBC. I guess if you're looking for a 24 hour news, then yeah, go with Al Jazeera English. I've watched it for their live coverage of Egypt, but I can't imagine watching AJE every day.",1296626278

It's amazing how far out of his way Gruber was going to avoid any criticism beyond the harmless dig at the rules changing without the rules having been changed. He even went so far as to suggest this would actually improve the user experience!<p>And Amazon did specifically get critiqued for strong-arm tactics in that post, so it's not like he was just in a cheerful mood and didn't want to say anything negative about anyone.",1296623108

Because of this it doesn't really make sense to read it like a newspaper, though their take on specific issues is often good, albeit brief. Many of their article are barely more than headlines.<p>And PBS is decent, but it's mainly targeted at people 60+ and retired. Waiting until 7pm for news from last week just isn't viable for people who actually need to know what's going on.",1296623102

I've personally observed PHP applications going into fairly high CPU use, and then settling down a lot once I installed APC (which prevents the machine from having the parse the PHP on every request).  It's not conjecture, it's observation.  I also know that due to the nature of how .NET apps work, they never have that kind of problem.  Neither do most other modern web frameworks.

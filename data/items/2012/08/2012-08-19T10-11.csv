You have more context against the rest of your life and the OP might be using that as the reason we perceive life going quicker.  But to me it's more like the ""weight"" of my life to date allows me a lot more perspective, I often measure an event against the birth of a child, a marriage, a house I used to live in etc.  Less about the MM/DD/YYYY and more about the ""Around this event this happened"".<p>When time seems to have moved quickly is when you're talking to your mom and dad about your grandson and the day your baby girl was born and how they're going through all the same things you did when you were having children.

4403737,comment,4402110,4403670,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Oh also one point on the absurdity of how sexual harassment laws are interpreted (in part because of vague standards like ""severe"" and ""pervasive"").<p>In the Jacksonville Shipyards case, there was a real sexual harassment problem.  This included some pretty vile behavior including male workers opening up a female co-workers tookbox and placing pornographic images there.  The behavior was vile, included real trespasses of personal space (the toolbox) and was pervasive.  She rightfully won her case.<p>However because the judgement ordered Jacksonville Shipyards to have a policy banning pornographic images in the workplace (reasonable even given 1st Amendment issues in the context of the <i>specific</i> behavior at issue), everyone has cited this case as an authority that presence of pornographic images in the workplace equals sexual harassment, in part because the standards are so vague that lawyers can't give any bright lines aside from ""ban all behavior that anyone <i>might</i> find offensive.""  But this flies in the face of logic.  In a nation where porn consumption is rapidly approaching <i>gender parity</i> no such rule makes objective sense.  This gets even worse when looking at hostile public accommodation harassment because there have been cases where businesses have been held accountable for customer actions.  Perhaps someone should sue reddit over the fact that they have subreddits that are for porn?  After all, reddit is a public accommodation, right?  But that would be silly and it would <i>not</i> be ok first-amendment-wise, would it?<p>Also I think your post fails to realize that semantic systems really do require negotiating possibilities.  If ""no"" may or may not mean ""never"" I think you have to give people any benefit of the doubt, and require that the person wishing to establish any no-further-contact rule be absolutely clear.  Otherwise rules no longer rule, and whoever takes the greatest offense gets the most power.  Such a subjective approach is wholely unacceptable any view that people should have reasonable opportunity to stay within rules defined ahead of time.  Otherwise where do you stop?",1345372898

And the bubble doesn't look like popping because it's propped up by massive immigration from Asia, previously Korea and Taiwan, but now especially mainland China. There's always more international students who'll rent the apartments and immigrants who'll buy the houses.<p>The last 5-yearly census held in 2006 showed (<a href=""http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/abtcit/ps/pdf/2006AucklandCensus.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/abtcit/ps/pdf/2006AucklandCensu...</a>) the percentage Asians in Auckland is 19%. It was maybe 1 or 2% only 25 yrs ago. The next census is due in Feb 2013 (delayed by 2 yrs because of the Jan 2011 earthquake in Christchurch), but based on impressions during my last trip back earlier this year, I'm guessing it could be up to 25%. That's quite a quick change in the ethnic makeup of a city.<p>When the NZ government ran out of money in 1991, they cancelled welfare benefits for anyone aged under 25. Suddenly, all these unemployed ""kids"" shifted back to their parents houses, and landlords had to half their rents to get tenants. To appease landowners and force those rents and house prices back up, the government opened the gates to Asian immigration bigtime.<p>Because of the automatic right of Australians and New Zealanders to live and work in each others country, many Asian immigrants move/d to Australia's big cities of Sydney and Melbourne after becoming a NZ citizen after 3 to 5 years of residence. That 19% Asian population of Auckland is only the tip of the iceberg of the immigrants who came.",1345372261

4403718,comment,4400797,4403617,7,0,einhverfr,,,"No.<p>Basically the issue has to do with how MySQL folks and PostgreSQL folks see the RDBMS.<p>MySQL users see the RDBMS as the bottom tier for the applications they are developing.  Consequently the system's design is aimed at letting the application steer the interaction.  If the application wants to treat 30 February as a valid date, that's the application's call and the app can set sql_mode appropriately and allow such values to be stored or not.<p>In other words, with MySQL, the db is there primarily to serve the application.<p>With PostgreSQL, it's very different.  The database is there not to serve the application but to manage data.  The applications are just users of that managed data.  In this model the database has a very different responsibility.  You might therefore call PostgreSQL data-centric.  Applications cannot decide how strict data handling should be because that would defeat the whole purpose of the RDBMS in the PostgreSQL worldview, which is the system which manages and ensures meaningfulness of data.<p>So MySQL sees the RDBMS as ultimately serving (and being accountable to) the applications and app developers.  PostgreSQL sees it as ultimately being accountable to the data and DBA's.  The problem is that this makes MySQL have trouble when multiple codebases are used to access the same data since each application could conceivably be operating on different sql_mode settings.  Each application can therefore be seen to be interfering with the other apps' state rather than all consuming shared managed data.<p>Hope this helps clarify things.",1345371911

Perfect strangers share apartments with each other, we figured <i>that</i> out, so once we realized we really do need webspace, and that it costs money and is complicated, respective services and culture will be established within months.

Yes, harassment generally is a bad thing.  Most people you would hope wouldn't keep asking someone out on a date after getting shot down  a bunch of times.  That's not necessarily harassment though.  It could be socially clueless or stupid, or whatever.  Moreover at a bare minimum such behavior smacks of the sort of failure that builds on itself.<p>But being <i>afraid</i> of committing harassment is <i>as big a danger</i> (or perhaps even larger) as actually harassing someone. You can't have the confidence that people find attractive if you are always afraid of crossing lines.  Sexy men are unafraid of sexual harassment lines.  They don't need to be.  It will never become sufficiently severe or pervasive because there are always greener pastures and one isn't going to waste time with the uninterested.<p>If ""no means no"" means you don't get to ask again for a date even if it is not made crystal clear that no means never, then if you are ever turned down by your spouse for sex, I guess you have to get a divorce if sex is important to the marriage.

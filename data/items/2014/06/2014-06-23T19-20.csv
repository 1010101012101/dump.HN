Gets things done.&quot;) and Rands (&quot;Be productive, be fantastically clever when necessary, speak truth to power, hit your dates, and don’t ship crap.&quot;).  These are people who deliver the goods.  Deliver them often enough and folks will know your name.<p>The second way is harder, particularly for the introverted.  This involves self-marketing, being obviously and repeatedly correct.  It also requires a bit of political adeptness and a bit of visionary helps as well.  Both Joel and Rands have done very well here and there&#x27;s a number of others who have made a name for themselves via the web.  If you have a choice, choose this method as it yields better visibility.  Although it also means that screw ups are magnified if and when they occur.<p>Am I the best programmer going?  No.  If you&#x27;re reading this, I suspect you&#x27;re not either...  But I work hard at delivering the goods, and I&#x27;m good at what I do.

Think about it, if SF were built _for_ cars, why would it be at the end of a peninsula so cars have to cross bridges to get to it? SF was built so that it was easy to access by sea from ships. Cars came much, much later and the issues with parking, etc... really stem from the city not being in a very good location vis a vis cars.

It&#x27;s only used to identify known child pornography that has already been reported, to make sure it can&#x27;t be re-uploaded.<p>2. Automated flesh tone detection only runs when a photo is shared.  (This is a change in policy; it used to run on upload.)  There are heuristics that try to measure whether it&#x27;s personal sharing or broad sharing, and we&#x27;re continually improving those.  The goal is to make flesh tone detection only run during broad sharing.<p>3. If the broad sharing criteria is met and automated flesh tone detection triggers a positive result, that is the only case in which an item is anonymously sent to manual review.  It&#x27;s some highly controlled clean-room environment where a dedicated team tries to determine whether the content is a legal risk or not.  Clear cases of shared child exploitation porn are reported.  (A parent&#x27;s &quot;baby in bathtub&quot; type of photos are not the target here.)  In most cases, it&#x27;s adult pornography or family photos.  In those cases, the folder is marked as porn and simply can&#x27;t be shared again.  (There&#x27;s a user-visible message on the web UI.)  It&#x27;s not deleted, and it continues to be fully accessible to the owner across all machines.<p>The scanning policy used to be more aggressive and didn&#x27;t exclude content that was unshared or only shared to a small set of people.  None of us liked that policy to begin with, and then some high-profile false positives helped force the policy to be revised.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoDNA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoDNA</a>",1403552916

Recently an investment group bought the last 11 lots in my 54 lot subdivision, they had been empty for three years.<p>Within short order 11 new homes were built and are being rented. There are two different companies contracted out to rent these homes for around 1300 a month.  Single family only, background checks, and a host of rules. Two other nearby subdivisions are trying to sell their incomplete lots but the builder for this group told us the appeal of ours was no pool or tennis courts. Toss in large homes, existing were 3800 to 5200, large lots, and it was ideal for their investment. The new homes are 2400 square feet but fit in architecturally.<p>With the possibility of an airport expansion in Paulding I suspect NW Metro Atlanta will see a large expansion in rental housing. Contracting out to build homes in numbers of near a dozen does save good money",1403552908

7934154,comment,7933386,7933386,3,0,grayclhn,,,"Two thoughts:<p>1) this is a somewhat bizarre exercise. It seems like it&#x27;s more relevant to work out the probability that the better team wins, for empirically relevant values of what the author&#x27;s calling &quot;expectation value&quot; --- i.e., give team A an expected scoring rate of (say), 2.0 goals per 90 minutes and give team B a rate of 1.9 goals per 90 minutes, then see how likely each team is to win. (R code, based on 10,000 simulations because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t feel like working out the probabilities by hand:<p><pre><code>     > mean(rpois(10000, 2) - rpois(10000, 1.9) > 0)\n    [1] 0.42\n    > mean(rpois(10000, 2) - rpois(10000, 1.9) < 0)\n    [1] 0.38\n    > mean(rpois(10000, 2) - rpois(10000, 1.9) == 0)\n    [1] 0.20\n</code></pre>\nIn words: the better team wins 42% of the time, the worse team 38%, and they tie 20%;)<p>The numbers 2.0 and 1.9 were made up, and the disadvantage of this approach is that you&#x27;re required to get some data and estimate reasonable values of each team&#x27;s scoring rate, or make them up. I should note here that OP has to do the same thing; the line<p><pre><code>    &quot;We can turn the Poisson distribution around, and ask: if a team scores N\n    points, what is the probability (or more technically correct, the probability\n    density) that the underlying expectation value is X?&quot;\n</code></pre>\nis nonsense without a Bayesian interpretation, which requires a prior density (which is the equivalent of making up numbers like the 2.0 and the 1.9 I used above, and weighting them by how likely you believe they are). Note that I could put a dogmatic prior on 2.0 and 1.9---a point mass for each team at one of the points---which would make me believe that the &quot;expectation values&quot; are 2.0 and 1.9 regardless of the actual score. Clearly that would be a bad prior, but it&#x27;s not clear that the implicit prior used in the article is a good one.<p>2) More important: teams sit on leads, so the probabilities aren&#x27;t constant. A team that outclasses another team probably won&#x27;t win by 19-0, because at 8-0 they&#x27;ll focus less on scoring and more on playing defense and avoiding injury. The same concept applies less dramatically with a 4-1 win, a 3-2 win, etc. Modeling strategy is much harder, so I&#x27;m not going to provide R code :). But one effect is that a poisson process will probably predict too many extreme scores.<p>That said, the OP&#x27;s thesis is self-evidently true: &quot;My thesis is that soccer is an amalgam of random processes whose net effect produces rare events—those more-or-less unpredictable events spread more-or-less uniformly in time.&quot; It&#x27;s a game with about 3-5 goals scored in 90 minutes. They&#x27;re rare!",1403552775

Cage Tic Tac Toe, where someone actually does start losing due to their weaker constitution?<p>While that could be imagined to be a fun sport, just as the soccer you describe is a fun sport, perhaps there is a way to play with some other rules that achieve more fun for the fan, for the player, and which give a sense that you know who is the best team in this tournament, rather than who comes from the country with the better long term immigration policy with respect to the game of tic tac toe?",1403552414

I put it out there to get feedback on it and was rather disappointed with the initial reactions (&quot;You don&#x27;t understand MVC!&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ve done it all wrong!&quot;).  But I put myself aside and tried to understand the feedback from their point of view.<p>One thing that became obvious is that most people didn&#x27;t see the solution as valid because they had completely different context and approach.  Fair enough.  There were also several that simply &#x27;cargo-culted&#x27; mvc responses without realizing that my gem was a thin wrapper around methods that DHH had already put in Rails (so if I didn&#x27;t understand MVC, neither did he! ;)  And no one commented on the biggest problems I legitimately saw with my approach: thread-safety and closures on controller instances in a prod env.<p>But none of that stopped this gem from being incredibly useful as I tried to break apart a giant monolithic legacy app that challenged traditional refactoring approaches.  Maybe it&#x27;s not perfect, but at least it&#x27;s a way forward.<p>So the moral of the story is: put your idea out there, expect feedback and criticism (maybe only criticism since the people who like things tend to keep quiet (e.g. the rvm story last year)) -- but so long as this thing is useful to one person (only you?), use it to make your life easier!<p>If it&#x27;s useful to others, that&#x27;s a bonus learning opportunity, but that shouldn&#x27;t be your sole motivation.",1403551846

I suggested that we target &quot;about the size of an MP3&quot; because that was the most common unit of download that a lot of people understood in the early 2000s and downloading software was something people weren&#x27;t terribly comfortable with.  I did some quick estimates and came up with 4MB as the goal based on the size of popular MP3s. By the time we shipped Firefox 1.0 in late 2004, we managed to get the download to about 4.7MB.<p>That was 2004 though. Today the Web is a lot more capable <i>because</i> browsers are a lot more capable. Also, typical download bandwidth for consumers is a lot more capable than it was in 2004.<p>Most of the growth in Firefox download size since then is a result of Gecko/Web platform feature growth, not the GUI features that users interact with.<p>That web platform capability isn&#x27;t free. It takes code to make JS dozens of times faster than it was in 2004. It takes code to add HTML5 and CSS 3 features, WebGL, WebRTC, and all of the other great stuff the Web platform includes today. That code makes the download larger.<p>That being said, I&#x27;d love to see another round of evaluation to see what can be trimmed or slimmed.

There are a limited number of spots; who gets them?<p>In the current situation, the spaces are free/subsidized, but you pay instead by driving in circles. That&#x27;s a big waste of time and adds to traffic congestion. Maybe that&#x27;s more &quot;fair&quot; in some sense, but that doesn&#x27;t make it good.<p>The app in question does either nothing or very little to help ration. It allows people who really need to park, and have the money to pay for it, to be more certain that they will get a space, which I guess is something. But it creates so many bad incentives that it&#x27;s making the problem worse, not better.<p>The city is in a better position to create market incentives, because they can charge for the entire duration that you&#x27;re in the space, not just the moment you happen to park. That means people would have no reason to camp out in a space waiting for the price to go up, which means more spaces will be available for useful purposes. It saves time and congestion, but perhaps loses out on some definitions of &quot;fairness&quot;.<p>Any other ideas?",1403551759

There would still be excitement, there would still be upsets, but the upsets would be based more on a cinderella team summoning their (admirable cheerable) &quot;will to win&quot; (or the champions failing due to hubris, cf tortoise and hare) and less due to statistical noise.<p>The sense I get watching soccer is, this is a good game with skill and athleticism, but something could be done to ensure that the best team wins more often; not that the outcomes would be more predictable, but that the outcomes would be more satisfying. And also, with fewer tie breakers.",1403551506

This state variable accumulates over long periods of time in the game, and is thus influenced by skill.<p>On the other hand (the claim goes), scoring potential in soccer is mostly affected by possession of the ball, which changes frequently, and there isn&#x27;t a persistent state.<p>The effect is that, with each possession, there is a small chance of Team A scoring.  The ball passes to Team B, and then back to Team A.  Team A then has another shot at scoring, which (due to lack of persistent state) is largely independent of its earlier chance.<p>To be more definite, the final score of Team A is:<p><pre><code>  S = C1 + C2 + ... + CN\n</code></pre>\nwhere the Ci&#x27;s are almost statistically independent, 0/1 random variables, with P(Ci = 1) rather low.  Each Ci indicates a score on a given ball possession.  This is a situation where the Poisson limit (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_limit_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_limit_theorem</a>) is applicable.<p>The NFL situation does not decouple this way, because the Ci&#x27;s are not independent, due to the field position issue.  The corresponding state variables with baseball are balls-strikes and players-on-base.<p>If you believe in the Poisson model, then Poisson model + low counts is an unfavorable regime to determine if Team A&#x27;s score-probability is less than Team B&#x27;s.  On the other hand, if it&#x27;s high counts (i.e., S is large) then it&#x27;s easy to tell.  This validates a commenter nearby who says he thinks season-wide scores provide more insight than tournaments.<p>As you mentioned, hockey would seem to be another good parallel to soccer (I think).  It was smart to notice that.<p>Incidentally, I don&#x27;t care one way the other about any of these sports, but I think the probabilistic analysis is interesting.",1403550796

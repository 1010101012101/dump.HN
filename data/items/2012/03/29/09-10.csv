3770426,comment,3770357,3770357,13,0,drostie,,,"Ah, the good old Wikipedia Effect. I think we could phrase it more precisely like this: when following anything anecdote-like, your mind becomes unaware of the causal process of following connections, and perhaps even unaware of the time spent doing so (although that might be more of an effect of Flow[1]).<p>If anything, this article is too shallow: I have actually gone past the consumption level and into a further abyss, at times. What I mean is, it's possible to crave an even deeper high, and to receive one.<p>The ""trick"", if self-destructive behavior can be called that, is that your brain has many different centers, like a language center and an audio center -- some of which are mostly idling while you're consuming information. You can use those zones to consume other information. So, like, I will sometimes play FreeCell (or solve other logic puzzles) while watching a lecture sped up by 33% to eliminate the time wasted by the ""ums"". The only limitation is eyestrain from staring at a screen too long and that feeling you get after about half an hour of delicious ""too-much-ness"".<p>Not all of the mechanisms of addiction transfer. So, here is one of the central mechanisms of addiction, the mechanism of escalation: an addict consumes Z in order to feel better in some sense -- a rush or an altered mental state -- but as time goes on, they build up a tolerance. They stop consuming Z to feel better. They start consuming Z to feel <i>normal</i> instead. That particular situation doesn't happen nearly so much with information, unless you count being nonplussed when you hear someone say something that you've already thought about.<p>The central problem of addiction is also only incompletely transferred over. I am not consuming information <i>in order to lose control</i>, which is what seems to shift e.g. alcohol-abuse into alcohol addiction. I was for a while addicted to the game Morrowind because I would actually jump into it in order to waste a day -- that was my goal, to lose control of myself. We need to make this distinction early: there is <i>information abuse</i> -- getting so saturated with information that you don't actually do anything with it -- and then there is <i>information addiction</i>, where the information itself wouldn't be interesting to you, if you weren't going to get lost in it.<p>[1] What I mean is that <i>creation</i> is not an antidote to losing-track-of-time, and therefore that's not really central to the problem. It is easy to create so much that one forgets to be productive: I will often lose track of the time when I am helping people with mathematics and physics; or even just now, as I am writing this on Hacker News. I could have been programming something useful to my larger goals instead.",1333014281

Personally I'm missing internet tethering (update coming soon, apparently) and Spotify, which exists but is so buggy I removed it and downgraded my account. I'm not too happy with the calendar app but I've been too lazy to look for a replacement. You're tied into Bing for search which I don't appreciate. File transfers over bluetooth are not supported, not sure if anyone still does this.<p>On the other hand, the UI is silky smooth, not at all like the Galaxy Nexus I have lying around here for development. I guess it's just a personal thing, but I really can't live with the UI lag and jitter on Android. You don't have a ton of options to play around with, but the features that are there just work without hassle.<p>Things like email, messaging, facebook all work great. The browser is nice and responsive too. You get Office for free so you can open Word documents on the go, and Nokia Drive 2.0 gives you free navigation with free offline maps. It works well here in the Netherlands and is a big plus for me. Skype is available as a beta which is still rough around the edges, but it's nice to be able to call my mom over Wi-Fi without wasting minutes.<p>So I guess it's a bit of a mixed bag. For me the positives greatly outweigh the negatives, so I'm a happy camper. Maybe you should just go play with one at a store and see if it's for you.",1333013840

Both work internationally though neither are sold outside the US (and Canada for the Captivate Glide), AFAIK.<p>The Desire Z is still sold though it is getting harder to find (e.g. retailers like expansys don't seem to have it any more). On the other hand, T-Mobile also recently had a surprise revival sale (now over, I believe) on its twin (the G2).<p>There are also a fair number of lower-end QWERTY devices (both Blackberry-style and sliders), but there is absolutely room for a high-end QWERTY ""hero"".

So this shouldn't really be a surprise. If on the overhand Farnell/RS have both just said that they aren't going to ship out of the blue, then the cynic in me would probably guess that there would be some other underlying reason why there is a delay, such as other manufacturing problems.<p>Either way, I don't think too many people are going to be too concerned.

(it should be noted that this is a common property of hobby projects)<p>It's fast, which is nice for the small boy (or girl) in all of us. It is gratifying to make software that can run like blazes.<p>I get the control over memory layout that I really want. By day I am a Java dev, by night I used to hack Erlang. Neither of these allows me to lay out an array of structs contiguously in memory. I did this for a quad-tree implementation and got 2X speed up on read operations. This means that all the stuff I am reading about CPU architecture, cache-lines and latency etc. can be experimented with in an easy to use environment. That's just pure fun and gratification.<p>Comprehension. In Java I recently wrote a SOAP server (I know, lame) and it took me an hour of XML fiddling before a more informed person told me that we do that with annotations now.<p>""Which annotations?\nThese magical ones.\nAh thanks""<p>That is a server in Java. At the end I was as ignorant as when I began. But I had the annotations and I had a server. This is bullshit. Programming without learning is like eating without tasting anything. In Go I am learning as I code - this is ecstasy. When I am confused I can jump straight into the library source code, ever tried that in a JEE server? It is painful.<p>Websockets are fun. Go supports websockets in the easiest way I can imagine.<p>Errors. Explicit errors in Go are just great. Verbose, yes. But, the clarity of this approach surprised me. All the networking code I have written in Java seemed mysterious. I would hack away and end up with a block of code that would fail from 'somewhere' inside. Errors have taught me a great deal about the different ways my networking code can fail. This is possibly my favourite part of Go (which makes me sound a bit boring).<p>Green threads are great. I'm sure plenty has been said about this. And message passing too. I won't say more about that.<p>Closures are marvellous. I have to say that I had a lot of reservations about closures in an imperative language. But if you are careful they are as safe as anything else (in that soup of mutable state). And so much fun.<p>It should be noted that a lot of my complaints about Java can be remedied. I can read a book about the latest JEE annotations (I did start reading one). I could study the Java networking code better and learn about things that way. But the crucial point is that Go allows me to do all of this while I do what I like best. Hacking. I can build systems and learn at the same time.",1333011768

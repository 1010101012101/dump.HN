The DS213 supports torrenting via the &quot;Download Station&quot; and I use various RSS feeds to automatically download the shows I like right on the NAS itself.<p>I stream content from the NAS to a little Pivos XIOS DS device running XBMC on the local network. This little streamer handles HD content easily and it&#x27;s also officially supported by the XBMC team. I spray-painted it black so it looks very similar to an AppleTV2. The Pivos is connected to my Samsung TV and I use an MX-500 Universal Remote to control both the Pivos and my TV. It&#x27;s a great remote with amazing IR range, you don&#x27;t even need to aim it.

First of all, a ship will likely be owned by someone, who then had to hire sailors to come work on the ship. This is an excellent framework for setting up some clear rules to which those who come aboard must sign up. The answer to your scenarios lies in what those rules are. Throwing someone overboard implies violence, so that&#x27;s no-go, but it&#x27;s perfectly plausible that there could be a clause for a majority to buy out a minority.<p>To answer your answer in the more general sense: If you raped someone in my community, I might maintain that I&#x27;m not justified in causing you direct physical harm. But I do know that you&#x27;re never doing any business with me. Other people in the community might feel the same, some might not, and if they shelter you, depending on the circumstances, I may or may not include those individuals in my exclusion. If I&#x27;m too broad in my banishment, eventually, I myself lose out, so there&#x27;s a feedback mechanism somewhere in there. I guess that&#x27;s punishment.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re a direct physical threat to the community, that community is justified in using proportional force in resisting that threat.

The syntax gets a bit silly with pointers, because you can have const pointers and pointers to const (and const pointers to const of course):<p><pre><code>    const Foo* foo; // Cannot change *foo, but can change the pointer (e.g. foo = 0)\n    Foo* const foo; // Can change *foo, but cannot change the pointer\n    const Foo* const foo; // Cannot change *foo or the pointer\n</code></pre>\n> The fact that working with non-const-correct libraries is a nightmare (prepare to const_cast a lot!).<p>Agreed!<p>> As far as I know, Common Lisp users have some kind of RAII with macros, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough to compare it to C++.<p>In my experience, the kind of problem RAII is useful for is far less common in Lisps (can only really speak for Clojure). One tends to not encapsulate resource management in any way, so handling it explicitly in the caller is fine. And you can use macros to do something when the scope is excited.<p>So in Clojure e.g., you can use with-open to do something with a file:<p><pre><code>    (with-open [writer (io/writer &quot;foo.txt&quot;)]\n        (write writer &quot;Hello&quot;)))\n</code></pre>\nwith-open ensures that the reader is properly closed when the scope is exited or when an exception occurs.<p>In C++ (or any OOP language I guess), you&#x27;d want something like this:<p><pre><code>    File foo(&quot;foo.txt&quot;);\n    foo.write(&quot;Hello&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nSo I suppose it depends on the philosophy.

It&#x27;s the <i>second</i> after Nix if I&#x27;m not mistaken, and it doesn&#x27;t reinvent the purely functional wheel either; it builds on top of existing core parts of Nix. Why not use Nix? Most importantly because it&#x27;s not GNU; NIH is sadly a real problem for GNU. But Nix also uses C++/Perl and a stand-alone package recipe language; Guix uses Scheme as much as possible. ISTR Guix also has some features that Nix lacks, such as unprivileged package management. Don&#x27;t quote me on it though; mayhaps it&#x27;s trivial to add to Nix or has already been done.<p>Cooperating with existing infrastructure is, I imagine, very difficult for a purely functional package manager, given the whole &quot;purely functional&quot; aspect. :-)<p>It&#x27;s also extremely unlikely that Debian will just give up apt, and RedHad will just give up rpm.<p>And every programming language platform seems to have its own package manager precisely because of that reason: there is no one package manager on all systems, but a proglang platform wants to offer package management on all systems, so each bake their own implemented in and special-made for the language.<p>It&#x27;s a sad state, but that&#x27;s the world of software for you.<p><a href=""http://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/927/</a>",1416322347

Why should I be bothered trying to develop ideas of other people who don&#x27;t put forward even a little bit of effort?<p>The concept is similar to SCrypt. He wants to utilize a memory-hard problem to make the difficulty of creating ASICs more difficult. However, this blog post has no ideas on how VLSI circuits work, nor any crypto calculations, nor any math or proofs that describe his thoughts.<p>He has a supposition: that using maybe AES (or any block cipher) as a random-number-generator, he can randomly traverse memory to increase the difficulty of hashing. (I&#x27;m assuming he&#x27;s just using any ol&#x27; block cipher for this process). He leaves a component of the calculation in one memory block to keep it &quot;inside the cache&quot;, presumably to keep it working quickly on modern CPUs.<p>Maybe. I dunno. He has no example code, which makes this sort of thing _very_ hard to discuss. I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;m reading his post correctly.<p>But assuming this is how he&#x27;s doing it (and mind you, I really don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about because he&#x27;s so imprecise), my $0.02 of &quot;serious&quot; criticism is that its not obvious that these calculations cannot be pipelined and simplified in an ASIC or FPGA... at least any more than SCrypt (or BCrypt) was.<p>And remember, SCrypt has ASICs coming out of the pipeline, and also ended up being much much faster on R9 290x GPUs than your standard CPUs.<p>Honestly, the X11 proposals from the alt-coin community are better researched and more precise than what this blog-post proposes.

If you have access to a Wordpress install that has some data in it, take a backup of that and restore it to your machine and learn how to write queries for it.  The way to figure out what to query is ask yourself questions, like, how many blog posts were posted in the past year.  What was the count of blog posts per month for the past year. Stuff like that.  And anything that you could see someone asking you to answer.  BTW -- I am not suggesting that Wordpress is an amazing database design, but it is fairly typical of what people do so its a reasonable place to learn.<p>Then once you feel pretty comfortable there, take a couple of the public datasets you can find online, Amazon shares a bunch of them and you can find others. Then create a database, import the data and write queries against it, following the same process of asking questions that seem interesting.  You can even take the max-mind CSV file they provide and create a database out of that to learn how to query it and get answers.  It is a small and simple dataset but there are a number of things you can figure out using it.<p>While I personally prefer postgres, I think MySQL is probably a good place to learn as there are a ton of tutorials and resources for it.  After you master the concepts then you can switch between platforms much easier, MS SQL, MySQL etc.  The basics are the same between them all, even though each has their own quirks and gotcha&#x27;s, knowing how to work in one you can always ask Google how to do X in Y if you already know how to do X.",1416321975

Then we learned to read their writing, and discovered they were incredibly violent and war-prone, just like every other human civilization: <a href=""http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-05-27/news/8601310832_1_temple-walls-torture-new-history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-05-27/news/8601310832_...</a><p>The similarity between the article&#x27;s claims about the Harappan civilization to the myths about the Maya are so striking that I&#x27;ve got to say the author and editor are both pretty far out of their depth to have not mentioned it.<p>So my prediction is that contrary to the article&#x27;s closing complex question, we won&#x27;t ever find out how the Harappan civilization avoided war, because they didn&#x27;t. When their writing is eventually translated there will be the &quot;surprising&quot; revelation that their highly ordered civilization was heavily regulated by highly organized violence at all scales, just like every other one we know anything detailed about.<p>As a river civilization, state control of irrigation may have played a significant role in social control, but violence underpinned it, and warfare was the largest-scale expression of that violence. Lack of evidence of sacked cities is evidence that they didn&#x27;t sack cities, not that they didn&#x27;t engage in war. Maybe they simply killed all the inhabitants in a more organized way. They were, after all, highly organized.<p>In general, it is more likely that the gaps are filled with things similar to well-studied cases than completely and entirely at odds with them. These mysterious people are deeply fascinating and were clearly extremely accomplished, but the odds are they had basic sociological similarities to everyone else.",1416319629

Check if hash(userid+password+salt) appears in Password table.<p>Password reset process: Given a userid and new password, change salt to a new random value and save to User table. Insert hash(userid+new_password+new_salt) into Password table. The old hash remains in the Password table and could still be used to log in, but in theory is useless because the salt has been destroyed.<p>Implementation detail: Make sure the old salt really is destroyed.<p>EDIT: After thinking about this, I think the reason <i>not</i> to do it is that it doesn&#x27;t really win you much protection over the usual approach -- a single table with userid; salt; hash(userid+password+salt).<p>In that scenario, if your database is stolen then the attacker will have to brute force each user password individually and compare it to the stored hash for that user. You hopefully used an expensive hash() algorithm so that will be a slow process. The only thing the separate table adds is an extra table lookup during each brute force attempt, which compared to the cost of hash() is basically free.<p>So yeah, I don&#x27;t think this really gets you anywhere.<p>EDIT2: In fact, you get almost exactly the same effect by making your bcrypt()/scrypt() parameters one notch harder.

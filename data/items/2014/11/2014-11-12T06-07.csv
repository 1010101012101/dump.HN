He believes that if employees want to own part of the company where they work, they should take their salary and go buy stock on the open market.<p>So, at least Buffet is consistent in his own view of the world.  He&#x27;s no hypocrite, and he&#x27;s not guilty of what the author is accusing him of.  The author should go read more of Buffet&#x27;s writings.<p>That being said, I disagree with Buffet and believe that the Silicon Valley model of throwing equity compensation to rank-and-file employees is justified.

</code></pre>
No, it&#x27;s not zero, it should be a number that corresponds to 3% and 10%, respectively. Yes, those numbers suck, but it helps to get the math right.<p>If the number is only 3% and 10% from those schools, then the problem starts at the funnel that feeds those schools [1]. More minorities and women need to apply to those schools, so that the percentage goes up.<p>Should companies look beyond those five schools? Yes, but...<p>I&#x27;m not going to speak for any other curriculums, but the truth is that most computer science curriculums in the US are absolute garbage. Many CS programs are just java schools [0]. What these companies have done is identified the schools whose programs have a reputation for not being java schools. Historically, you could figure out which programs are not java schools by looking for those that use books like SICP, K&R, CLRS, TaoCP, PAIP, AIMA, EOPL, the dragon book, etc. as the basis for their CS curriculum. If there are schools out there with a much greater percentage of minorities and women that use such books for foundational courses, then you should suggest those schools as places to recruit from.<p>Simply put, the criteria for spending time, effort and money to recruit from other schools needs to be based primarily on the rigor of the curriculum, with demographics of the student body being a secondary goal.<p>That all being said, a lot of the best software developers I&#x27;ve met that didn&#x27;t go to those top schools didn&#x27;t graduate with a degree in computer science at all. Pretty much all the others are auto-didacts. Assuming this is generalizable, the only actionable you can extract from it is not to recruit based on school at all.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchool...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8593277"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8593277</a><p>[2] FWIW, I didn&#x27;t graduate from a top school (NCSU) and double majored in textile technology and apparel mgmt and psychology, so I&#x27;m not even advocating a position I myself gain from.",1415773893

I&#x27;m sure that from their perspective it&#x27;s the obvious best advice. I am commenting to say that people who have invested the most valuable years of their life in school tend to spend the rest of their lives hunting for evidence that they made a great decision.<p>The simple fact is that their answers are more about their own confirmation bias than giving actionable advice.<p>While it&#x27;s true that lots of successful people went to college, the simple fact that you taught yourself to code and you&#x27;re hanging out on Hacker News puts you into a completely different category than 99.9% of people that don&#x27;t go to college.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people talk here about ROI on degrees and &quot;the path&quot; and what makes a good student. I&#x27;ve seen far less about how people are highly unlikely to know what they should be doing with the rest of their lives right out of high school. That there&#x27;s so much focus on 18 year olds paying crazy tuition to get a piece of paper that proves they attended some generic lectures on a generic subject is criminal.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m ranting. I&#x27;m projecting. I didn&#x27;t go to college and I have been very successful. It&#x27;s because I decided early on to feed my intellectual curiosity and give myself permission to fall in love with things that themselves lead to other things. It&#x27;s way more important that you learn about music and travel and optimize for interesting than push your square peg through a round hole.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you won&#x27;t ever go. But if you don&#x27;t think this is the right time, then you are the best person to know that. Just don&#x27;t be idle; try to imagine that your life will be a series of well executed five year plans.<p>Don&#x27;t let yourself get burnt out along the way, it sucks.<p>What I recommend is that you join a startup and work there for about a year. Then get the hell out of California for a year; I recommend that you go work at a startup in Berlin or Amsterdam for a year. Get a global perspective.<p>Hacker News is an incredible resource, but it&#x27;s also really full of people that buy into a California tech ideology that can be self-limiting. It&#x27;s just one of many lenses through which you can see the world.<p>Good luck; I&#x27;m really excited for you. Just remember: no person has ever been on their deathbed and thought, &quot;man...

However, the trading in any intermediate currently pair between those, NOK-USD-JPY, for example, will negate that wall in no time at all for sheer volume alone and any artificially imposed walls based on this kind of numerology would be chopped down by HFTs looking for arbitrage opportunities in milliseconds.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at a big pair like EUR-USD with a hypothetical wall at 1.25, for example, it&#x27;s possible it might last for a little longer. But again, arbitrage across currency pairs - EUR-JPY-USD or EUR-GBP-USD or whatever - will wipe out any numerical niceties in marginally longer than no time at all.<p>That said the more TA traders are out there the more the actual investors (and with SPY having an annual volume 8.5 times its number of shares there seem to be too few of those) can get themselves a long-term good average of &quot;Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.&quot; just through regularly putting money aside and investing through dollar cost averaging in index ETFs/mutual funds.",1415772870

One of the design goals for that language should be to work well for graphical UI - imagine if a framework like React had a language designed around it instead of being shoehorned onto JS. We could start talking about ideas like separating the layout, styling, and interactive components in a better balance than that between HTML, CSS, and JS.<p>Really my main point is - There&#x27;s a conversation to be had around starting from (near) scratch. I think in the end a lot of *nix would have to be incorporated to deal with the realities of hardware and established protocols, but we could also look at starting in a VM and working towards bare metal.

8250347,comment,8246706,8248307,0,0,vorg,,,"You relate Haskell to standard theory and Clojure to non-PL-theory structures. I think the real issue is that strongly-typed lazy functional code (Haskell) and dynamically-typed isomorphic code (Clojure, and Lisp) have an &quot;impedance mismatch&quot; such that they don&#x27;t inter-translate very well. I think that&#x27;s based on the different foundation of each language.<p>Haskell is strongly typed and lazily evaluated, which easily enables functions to take only one argument at a time. Although a function could take a tuple parameter, it can be, and usually is, rewritten to take each component of the tuple as a separate parameter, which makes the strong typing and builtin currying simple, higher structures like monads possible, and the syntax can designed to suit this style.<p>Lisp functions, on the other hand, must take many arguments at a time to cater to the isomorphicity of the language. It&#x27;s therefore much more difficult for parameters to be typed, or to curry them. The syntax requires explicit visual nesting. Inter-translating between this style and the Haskell style therefore is difficult.<p>I&#x27;d even suggest the Haskell and Lisp styles are two different peaks on the ladders of programming language abstraction, and the poster child of each, monads and macros, just don&#x27;t interoperate very well, simply because of the different required foundations of each language.",1409518447

8250343,comment,8249052,8250283,2,0,Erwin,,,"He does not mention it, bug ZFS has great support for snapshots (compared to e.g. LVM snapshots). You don&#x27;t have to carve out disk space in advance where snapshots are stored and they are relatively high performance, so you can have an hourly, daily and weekly rotating set of snapshots (there are some scripts around for that retention). As the snapshots take up space, your available disk space just diminishes. And you can set it up so while in you are in dir &quot;foo&quot;, your &quot;foo/.snapshot/16:00/&quot; has the contents of that directory when shapshotted hourly.<p>Another cool feature: you can do a send a diff between 2 snapshots as a file stream (over e.g. SSH) and replay it on another machine. So that&#x27;s like using rsync except it&#x27;s actually a stable snapshot (rsync can&#x27;t fully handle files that changes while it&#x27;s copying them) and you don&#x27;t have to re-checksum every part of every changed file.

I do not recommend anyone use SATA PM for anything that really matters, and if you must use it, do not run more than one port multiplier on a single system at a time.

I don&#x27;t have figures for only that machine, but my entire rack, which includes a router machine, two ISP modems, the ZFS-running machine and two SAS expanders, averages around 330 watts.<p>After setting it up, I wouldn&#x27;t say that it requires any time to manage. Getting it all set up just right, with SMART alerts and capacity warnings and backups and snapshots, all of which I roll myself with various shell scripts, took a long time. Besides that initial investment, the only &quot;management&quot; I have to do is respond to any SMART alerts, add more vdevs as the pool fills up, and manage my files as I would on any other filesystem.<p>I use the space for just about everything. Lots of backups. I use the local storage on all of my workstations as sort of &quot;scratch&quot; space and anything that matters in the long term is stored on the server. The highest density stuff is, of course, media: I have high definition video and photographs from my digital SLRs, I have tons of DV video obtained as part of an analog video digitization workflow, media rips, and downloaded videos. (I even have a couple of terabytes used up by a youtube-dl script that downloads all of my channel subscriptions for offline viewing, and that&#x27;s something I doubt anyone would do unless they had so many terabytes free.) I keep copies of large datasets that seem important (old Usenet archives, IMDB, full Wikipedia dumps). I keep copies of old software to go with my old hardware collection. I have almost every file I&#x27;ve ever created on any computer in my entire life, with the exception of a handful of Zip and floppy disks that rotted away before I could preserve them, but that is only a few hundred gigabytes. I scan every paper document that I can (my largest format scanner is 12x18 inches, so anything larger than that is waiting for new hardware to arrive someday), so almost all of my mail and legal documents are on there too.<p>(I had a dream the other night that someone got access to this machine and deleted everything. Worst. Nightmare. Ever.)<p>A cloud solution would not have met my use case, since one of the primary needs I have is to be self-sufficient in terms of storing my own data, and I also want immediate local access to a lot of the things on there. I do use various cloud solutions, but only for backup, never as primary storage.<p>Rolling it myself was definitely cheaper than any out-of-the-box hardware solution I&#x27;ve seen. The computer itself is a Supermicro board with some Xeon middle-of-the-range chip and a ton of RAM, and an LSI SAS card. Connected to the SAS card are two 24-bay SAS expander chassis, which contain the drives, which are all SATA.<p>I&#x27;d say that building something like this would cost you maybe about 4000USD, not counting the cost of the drives.

8250301,comment,8248946,8250184,8,0,saurik,,,"Persona assumes something trivially false for most end users: that email addresses are canonical and precious; in fact, email addresses tend to be recycled (by schools and ISPs), users have many of them (causing them to never remember which one hey are using, a problem compounded  y the usage of clients that aggregate their email together), and they are extremely temporary (users throw them away and get new ones when they start getting too much spam, and are even forced to do so when they change jobs, graduate from school, move to a new area, or simply change email providers, as even savvy users tend to rely on third-party domains, including gmail.com).<p>This makes persona both frustrating for the user (having to do account migrations at the least convenient time <i>on every website they use</i>, always using the least convenient flow as by the time they notice they have already lost access to their old email address) and insecure for everyone involved (the situation where user&#x27;s account is compromised when their email address is recycled is bad for everyone). In comparison, users tend to have one account on Facebook, and that account is theirs and theirs alone essentially forever.<p>Facebook has amazingly well-engineered mechanisms to do account password recovery (my favorite is the one that shows you uncommon pictures of your friends--old shots, people in Halloween costumes, etc.--and asks you to identify them), the account has a username independent of email addresses (to the limited extent to which email addresses matter, if the user changes addresses Facebook will be the first thing they think of to update <i>before</i> they go through with the process, and even if they don&#x27;t they will catch it immediately as most normal users use Facebook often), and Facebook provides a central location to store a bunch of common profile information (in particular a picture) that the user will actually keep up to date (which is pleasant for both the user and the website). Using Facebook as a login provider actually solves problems for both users and website operators in a reasonably secure manner.<p>Users on websites like Hacker News, developers, the kinds of people who build websites, sadly don&#x27;t notice these problems, as they are the kind of people who value email addresses and understand the issues related to security if addresses are reused: this is fundamentally unlike a normal user or sadly even a normal system administrator. I have been saurik@saurik.com since 1997 and will be until the day email is dead: I was really argumentative any time my University asked me to use saurik@cs.ucsb.edu (an address they later cancelled on me and recycled :/) and so avoided third-party addresses, and noticed the canonicalization problem after only a year of saurik@poboxes.com (a service that happened to also help users get &quot;vanity&quot; email addresses, as users care more about cool addresses on domains like starfleet.com than ones that won&#x27;t change). I am not typical: Persona, sadly, is designed for users like me at the exclusion of normal people :(.<p>For more details about these issues, I will refer you to earlier discussions of Persona and social login mechanisms, where I provided much longer comments, examples, walkthroughs, etc.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7243021"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7243021</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5408735"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5408735</a>",1409517424

It makes sense and it&#x27;s true that going to a smaller, more affluent school is a big advantage for a student.<p>I imagine that there&#x27;s a minority of white parents that like the segregated schools simply because they don&#x27;t like black people. But, I also think that the majority of the white parents sending their kids to economically/racially segregated schools are simply seeking and advantage for their own kid.<p>The problem comes from the long-term effects on the community. We&#x27;ve ended up with concentrated black communities that are less economically developed and harboring students with fewer opportunities for advancement. There&#x27;s no good reason that a black student should be denied the same opportunities as a white student. We&#x27;d all be better off if black people had the same opportunity to achieve as a white person -- because white people would be better off if poor people (even poor white people) had the same opportunities as rich people.<p>Self-segregating is normal but doing it purely along color lines is abnormal, or at least irrational. I have friends of all races and from most continents (I don&#x27;t have a friend from Antarctica and I can&#x27;t remember an Australian friend) but I don&#x27;t have many impoverished friends. People hang out with similar people but it&#x27;s short-sighted to see it as a race thing; it&#x27;s a socio-economic thing.<p>We&#x27;re all better off with highly integrated schools because we&#x27;re all worse off with a large and growing class of second-class citizens that have fewer opportunities. Poor people with fewer opportunities commit more crimes, make less money and cost more public money to support (even if you only consider prison costs). People with a good education and good access to  career opportunities commit far fewer violent crime and pay way more taxes and increase the prosperity of any community they join. We&#x27;re better off being integrated.",1409517397

Messages as function calls, and MVC comes from 70s smalltalk.<p>It&#x27;s not strongly coupled because of a few reasons. Firstly because in JavaScript it is simple to dynamically reassign objects and functions.  The receiving object does not care where it got the function called from. Only the sending object knows where it is sending to. However, from Coupling theory in Software Engineering, we know that if there are a small amount of outputs then the strength of the coupling is still low. Luckily in many apps there are often only a few places where you want to send a message. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29#Module_coupling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programmin...</a><p>Yes, if there are lots of outputs it may be useful to reduce the coupling. In my experience, even with large apps (100 person teams), this is often not the case.<p>It is often useful to know what your app is doing by looking at where the events are going. Just using function calls makes this very easy, both in source code and in the debugger. So this also needs to also be weighed up in the decision of how you are passing events around.",1409517279

Or if you are completely wrong about your prior, then you may do badly too. It&#x27;s a classic &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot; situation. This reminds me of the Charles Babbage quote:<p>&quot;On two occasions I have been asked, &#x27;Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?&#x27; I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&quot;<p>Furthermore, the frequentist method doesn&#x27;t do well either, they just aren&#x27;t eating most of the berries (and the berries that they are eating, are the wrong ones!). If apparently eating berries isn&#x27;t worth much to you, but dying has a big negative cost, you should give that to the Bayesian loss function, and it too will be conservative about eating berries. I&#x27;m very surprised that you seriously consider a method that lets you eat the more poisonous berries, simply because they are rarer, a valid criticism of Bayesianism! If you had given the correct loss function to the Bayesian, he would simply only let 20% of the people eat berries, but that 20% would be eating the mostly edible berries, and not the mostly poisonous berries of course.<p>Saying that Bayesians also care about things that did not happen because one of edible/inedible is something that did not happen is a bad comparison. It is unknown whether the berry is edible/inedible, so it makes sense that we consider both. On the other hand, it is known that the berry is blue, so why would we care about what if it was red?",1409516807

Essentially the only assumption about a random variable is measurability, and I essentially gave that.<p>Each of the limit theorems has assumptions, and in some cases minimal assumptions are difficult to consider, e.g., for the Lindeberg-Feller version of the central limit theorem.<p>For a random variable with the Cauchy distribution, as I recall, the integral of the positive part is infinity and that of the negative part is infinity so that to define its expectation we would have to subtract one infinity from another which, with the measure theory approach to &#x27;improper&#x27; integrals, we are not willing to do.  So, that random variable does not have an expectation, and the law of large numbers does not apply to an independent, identically distributed sequence of such random variables.  Again,<p>> We don&#x27;t have rock solid theorems that the average is of any interest.<p>Sure, we do:  Maybe for real valued random variables X and Y and real number a, we are told that<p>X = a + Y<p>and want to find a.<p>Suppose we have E[X] exists and is finite and for i = 1, 2, ..., we have real value random variables X(i), independent and distributed like X.  So, then we also have independent Y(i) distributed like Y. Suppose we are told that E[Y] = 0.<p>Then we can use the law of large numbers to estimate a.<p>> If we&#x27;re interested in knowing whether a dam is likely to overflow based on historical water levels, the average is of limited use -- for heights well below the highest historical depth, an average will be something that we can at least calculate, but not precisely.<p>If we have random variable X that is 1 when the dam overflows and 0 otherwise, then the probability the dam overflows is just E[X].  If we have independent, identically distributed &#x27;samples&#x27; of X, that is, X(i) for i = 1, 2, ..., then we can use the weak law of large numbers to estimate E[X].<p>The role of &quot;historical water levels&quot; here is not trivial to evaluate; the main reason is that we are not sure we have the values of a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables.<p>Generally from experience in applied probability and statistics, we should know well that saying what the probability of some particular water level is in the next 100 years is a challenging problem with no royal road to a solution and not a weakness of the axioms, expectation, or the laws of large numbers.<p>> This makes no sense.

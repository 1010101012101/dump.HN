8158485,comment,8150292,8150979,2,0,mpyne,,,"Interception of phone calls in Afghanistan is a very easy example. It practically by definition fails to implicate <i>any</i> domestic liberties concern for American citizens, and has completely defensible purposes to include counter-terrorism and military intelligence (it may surprise people to hear this, but the U.S. military is still fighting and dying in Afghanistan).<p>Likewise with intercepting the communications of foreign leaders (even allied ones): It&#x27;s literally what the NSA is paid to do, it doesn&#x27;t implicate domestic liberties concerns, it&#x27;s not mass surveillance, and the U.S. government (and the American people they&#x27;re to serve) has very real reasons to know what the leadership of the rest of the world is thinking behind their public statements. It&#x27;s the same reason the rest of the world spies on the communications of American politicians and diplomats (e.g. the leaked conversation between U.S. and E.U. diplomats regarding Ukraine during the Automaidan revolution).<p>The only outcome that possibly could have come from Snowden leaking that information is the outcome that actually happened: Justified outrage by the German population which significantly strained relations between Germany and the USA, and at almost the worst possible time for that to happen.<p>Even PRISM I would argue went beyond the pale. It didn&#x27;t help that initial reporting about PRISM was simply inaccurate, but PRISM, if you look at it objectively, actually represents nothing more than a Web-based automation of a legitimate and legal government function. The <i>only</i> thing PRISM is, is computer-automated warrant/subpoena compliance.<p>Again, PRISM isn&#x27;t mass surveillance (as it needs specific selectors), it&#x27;s not even warrantless (even when only an NSL is used, an NSL is still more than is Constitutionally required for foreign citizens), and it&#x27;s not unilateral on NSA&#x27;s part (companies receiving NSLs or warrants via PRISM still have to have their own legal teams review them and sign off, and if they don&#x27;t agree can have the orders reviewed by FISCR).<p>What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s an incredibly useful tool for one of the few functions of NSA that most people agree is legitimate... or it was, until Snowden told the jihadist world that Skype and Facebook were unexpectedly unsafe. It&#x27;s not Snowden&#x27;s fault that jihadists were under that mistaken assumption, but it is his fault for splashing awareness in their face in such a manner, and for not ensuring that Greenwald and WaPo&#x27;s coverage of the technical aspects of PRISM were correct in the initial stories.<p>Finally (perhaps most ironically) Snowden leaked private information about many targets of NSA surveillance to a group of people ranging between journalists and activists. Hopefully all such recipients were as careful with that cache as the Washington Post was, but to quote The Week:<p>> Is it chilling that The Washington Post now has these [160,000] intercepts? Yes. Does it represent a huge failure by the NSA? Debatable. The person who obtained them originally, Edward Snowden, spent more than a year, with very high clearances, trying to figure out how to steal them without triggering alarms. To say that they weren&#x27;t protected by the NSA is to blame your grandmother for keeping her purse in a simple combination lock safe the kitchen, and not the thief who broke into the house to steal it. (In this case, the thief cased the house for a long time and had to figure out the combo to the lock.)<p>Even though the WaPo piece in question is intended to be damning of the NSA, even they noted many things that the NSA had been claiming all along: &quot;fresh revelations about a secret overseas nuclear project, double-dealing by an ostensible ally, a military calamity that befell an unfriendly power, and the identities of aggressive intruders into U.S. computer networks&quot;. The double-dealing one is especially intriguing, as it explains why the USA might be spying on German leaders in the first place, due to long experience with double-dealing by allies.<p>Likewise, the WaPo reported &quot;Months of tracking communications across more than 50 alias accounts, the files show, led directly to the 2011 capture in Abbottabad of Muhammad Tahir Shahzad, a Pakistan-based bomb builder, and Umar Patek, a suspect in a 2002 terrorist bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali.&quot; The inescapable conclusion is that Snowden leaked operational details of successful operations to apprehend no-shit actual terrorists who no-shit actually killed people (and presumably were working to kill more). This intelligence didn&#x27;t implicate crimes by the U.S. government so it can&#x27;t be called whistleblowing with a straight face. How would <i>that</i> news article read on its own: &quot;NSA whistleblower accuses NSA of tracking down Bali bombers&quot;?<p>All of this is the more damning IMHO given that Snowden made sure to distinguish his behavior from Pfc. Manning&#x27;s, with Snowden saying he made sure to be selective about what he took and passed into the hands of others. But his actions prove his words a lie; 160,000 intercepts taken for no better reason than they were intercepted is no more selective than Manning taking a database of years worth of Army operational logs just because they were there, not to mention the 1.5 million other documents scraped laboriously from NSA servers.<p>Far from being &quot;more selective than Manning&quot;, Snowden used even more breadth than Manning (who after all, really &quot;only&quot; took the helicopter video, Army theater daily operational logs and diplomatic cables).<p>I hope you take this in the spirit it&#x27;s intended. Whistleblowing is vitally important to the health of our nation, but disagreeing with legitimate (and legal) government policy because it&#x27;s not libertarian enough is not the same as whistleblowing, and that gets conflated in the Snowden discussion all the time, usually to whitewash the excesses of Snowden&#x27;s actions.",1407632142

8158464,comment,8157425,8157425,2,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>So what type of software developer / hacker are you? What kind of company do you work for? How did you start off in the industry? What new technologies do you want to learn next?</i><p>I&#x27;ve been developing software for a living since 2000, and before that I was working in IT since about 1995. I started out doing a lot of network admin (Netware 3.1 anybody?) and AS/400 operations stuff while I was still in school.  I dabbled in programming when I was a kid (8-9-10&#x27;ish or so) but we never had a PC in my home, so I never got deep into programming until college.  I took a programming class in college about 1992 and was immediately hooked.  I bought a copy of Herbert Schildt&#x27;s <i>Teach  Yourself C</i>, downloaded a shareware C compiler from somewhere, acquired a cheap PC and have basically never looked back.<p>Over my career I&#x27;ve mainly worked in Java, with some C/C++ before that, and now do a lot of Java and Groovy stuff. I&#x27;ve also worked with Visual Basic a bit a long time ago, and with Python a bit circa 2008-2009 or so.  More recently I have some ambition to learn R, Prolog, Go, Clojure, Scala, Julia and a handful of other stuff that&#x27;s on my &quot;learn one day&quot; list.<p>What kind of company do I work for? By day I work for Open Software Integrators[1], a boutique professional services firm in Durham NC, where we focus on helping companies apply &quot;Big Data&quot; technologies.  One of my most recent projects was building a Hadoop data warehouse for a big pharma company that was doing some <i>really</i> cool stuff that I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m not allowed to talk about (non-disclosure agreements and what-not).<p>By night and weekend I work on a startup called Fogbeam Labs[2].  We are focused on applying Semantic Web tech, social networking, machine learning and related tech to create a kick-ass Open Source organizational knowledge management / collaboration system.<p>And like (many|most|some|???) hackers, I am also generally interested in tech beyond programming.  I am a member of the local hackerspace in Durham[3], and I dabble in various things there.  I&#x27;ve been learning to do some embedded / microcontroller stuff with Arduino, rPi, Beaglebones, etc., building electronic circuits from discrete components, started on building a coil-gun (but have kinda let that go dormant lately), and I have a goal to build a Mantis PCB mill at some point.  I&#x27;d also like to build a 3D printer (maybe a rep-rap) someday.<p>I did dabble in the &quot;black hat&quot; hacking scene a bit back in the mid 90&#x27;s, but was really more into phone phreaking stuff.  My claim to fame from that phase of my life is that me and a couple of friends had admin level access to a phone switch owned by the local telco (I think it was a DMS-100) for a while.  But by the late 90&#x27;s I was getting into my professional career and it was becoming obvious that playing in that world was a fast path to either jail or at least a big hit to my career so I dropped out of that scene pretty much completely.  I mean, yeah, I still read 2600 and Phrack every now and again, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.osintegrators.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osintegrators.com</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.fogbeam.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fogbeam.com</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.splatspace.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splatspace.org</a>",1407631539
8158463,comment,8156786,8157517,5,0,amag,,,"I&#x27;ve done a bit of carpentry around my house. Since I live in Sweden I always use the metric system.<p>For me the focus on division by three is a bit strange. Sure I sometimes need to divide by three, but I also need to divide by five, or two or seven. I guess the thing is that our building standards are expressed in the metric system, so it makes sense thinking about them in terms of meters or centimeters. US building standards are expressed in the imperial system, so it makes sense to think about them in feet and inches.<p>Why would I want a unit that&#x27;s 1/60th of a meter when I have a perfect 1/100th of a meter? A third of a meter is 33.3cm, working with wood you don&#x27;t need more precision than that, if the decimal sign makes it difficult to do calculations, just step it up to 333mm.<p>I&#x27;m not a carpenter by trade but I guess that a professional carpenter here learns quite well how to divide by three even in metric. I see this argument popup every time there&#x27;s a discussion about using the metric system in the US and I find it weak. For me this argument only sounds like &quot;but it&#x27;s hard to learn something new&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are pros and cons with both the metric and the imperial system, but in the globalized world we live in, the fact that The Rest Of The World uses the metric system should be a pretty convincing argument to use it in the US as well. I mean after all, The Rest Of The World has accepted English (in one form or the other) as the Lingua Franca in order to make communication across borders easier. You don&#x27;t see us whine about stuff like &quot;but in Swedish I can much more succinctly express that it&#x27;s my paternal or maternal grandparent I&#x27;m talking about, so I don&#x27;t want to use English&quot;.",1407631536

8158461,comment,8157921,8158374,4,0,xaa,,,"First, there&#x27;s no way you could offend me by anything you say. You&#x27;ve already done me a great service by explaining your views. I&#x27;ve met people with similar views before, but usually they&#x27;re reluctant to describe them at length.<p>I agree that traces of people remain after their death -- genetically, in their children, and in the memories of those who knew them. But those traces fade quickly, and for all but the most famous, virtually disappear in a few centuries. And surely you agree that a memory is a poor substitute for a person -- I&#x27;d rather be able to talk to my dad or neighbor than have even the fondest memories of them.<p>We both seem to agree that improving the quality of people&#x27;s lives, as well as the quantity, is extremely important. Aging is far from the only problem society faces. Tackling inequality/poverty, political dysfunction, war, ignorance, and other problems are also extremely important goals, and I greatly respect people who work on them. I also recognize that curing aging will introduce new societal problems even as it solves others (e.g., rising health care costs).<p>I think where we differ is that I think these other problems can be solved as well, and I believe that curing aging will, on balance help society more than it harms it. Consider how our scientific progress is retarded when our best scientists die or lose their mental acuity later in life. I&#x27;ve already alluded to the fact that people seem to ignore problems ranging from global warming to the national debt because &quot;I&#x27;ll be dead before it becomes a problem.&quot;<p>I have several responses to your concern that if people stop aging, we won&#x27;t have room for future generations. First, it is well known that wealthier people and countries have a lower birth rate, so by solving poverty, the birth rate will decrease. Second, even if people don&#x27;t age, they can still die from accidents or disease. Also, I think eventually humanity will expand to the stars, although we are far from it now.<p>Massive societal change is coming, from many sources, whether or not aging is solved (although I make no claims about when). Technology is going to put many people out of work. AI will eventually be created. Methods will be developed to improve human intelligence, enhancing technological development but increasing wealth inequality. Even if none of these developments occur, there is still an increasing centralization of wealth and power in developed countries.<p>It is hard to know how curing aging would interact with these trends, except to say that I think people would be more circumspect about societal decisions if they knew they would have to bear the long-term consequences. I think the demand for religion would decrease, which would have positive effects on geopolitical stability. Living longer would also give people more time to get educated, which would help with the electoral ignorance that is at the root of so many problems in the US.<p>Finally, your proposed principle for determining the &quot;correct&quot; lifespan is not a new one:<p>> When you start to try and reverse or disable aging as opposed to attempting to cure disease.<p>The NIH takes a similar view. The problem is that almost all major diseases (diabetes, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease, to some extent cancer) are all diseases of aging. Young people don&#x27;t (usually) get them. It may well be that to &quot;cure&quot; these diseases, we will have to solve the underlying problem -- that is, aging.<p>Also, consider that it is just genetic happenstance that our species max lifespan happens to be 120. Why should it not be 15 or 60 or 240? Letting evolution decide our lifespan is certainly the simplest method, but it seems fairly arbitrary.",1407631487

Or it can be also an example of ageism if both gender and age are involved.<p>But let&#x27;s forget it for now, there&#x27;s another problem here and that is the title is just poor writing. If the author aimed for comical value, then he should have used someone who certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to create a website. A cat would work. Caveman, too, really. That&#x27;s because being comical in this case is based on a sharp contrast - it&#x27;s hard to imagine either a cat or a caveman building a website, and images we tend to see when trying are rather funny.<p>By using someone who could want to build a website, and someone almost all people have deep connection with, you&#x27;re just dividing your audience into two groups, those with &quot;website making&quot; someone and those without. What do you think is to gain from such a division? Maybe a flamewar, at best.<p>Either way, whether it&#x27;s just poor writing, poor marketing or sexism, it&#x27;s still counter productive. It attracts bad kind of attention and encourages off topic rants. Don&#x27;t do this. If you&#x27;re (the author) not skilled in writing enough, just find a copywriter who will write the piece for you. Or write it yourself and send it to all your friends asking for corrections.

When you are dead you feel no pain. You don&#x27;t even know you are dead.

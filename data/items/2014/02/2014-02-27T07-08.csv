Backwards compatibility and platform stability are GOOD THINGS that we need more, not less of. Lest we perpetually build content for doomed platforms, and leave no mark, no history on the world.<p>the better course is evolution, not revolution.</i><p>Candles oil lamps, and torches were pretty good at providing light at night in the 18th century, then there came electricity and the light bulb, everyone slowly threw away their candles for something better. Many people tried to design better candles instead of switching over. Candles that would burn brighter and longer, candles that would not blow out as easily and did not put off as much smoke, but you know what? These were was mere evolutionary changes and could not &quot;hold a candle&quot; to the revolutionary benefits of the light bulb.<p>Sure it took a lot of work for people to take their oil lamps and candle fixtures off of the walls and ceilings. It was a lot of work to run wiring and put up new electric fixtures. But the time spent was an investment. Eventually it led to a lot better solution and a lot less effort in total.<p>You are one of these guys who was using and evolving candles and oil lamps. You just can&#x27;t see the bigger picture.<p>These HNers who are not happy with still being forced to use candles are the real innovators... The technologists. You who are happy with the candle are merely paint and canvas artists.<p>Paint and canvas artists in the 80s and 90s started to scoff when computer art and graphics began to gain prominence. These artists lacked the skills to do art with new technology, and lacked the ambition and any passion which was required to learn something new that would have diversified their artistic talents. They had their tools and they didn&#x27;t want new ones. Their opposition actually was a result of a fear of being displaced, they wanted to stay in their stagnated comfort zone.<p>Many web designers today are much the same. You want to make art with your old tools and are not really technologists at all, perhaps with new brushing techniques (JS libraries) in some instances, but never with any major evolutionary change.<p>This stagnates innovation, even worse you are actively supporting the suppression of choice because you are afraid that you may become obsolete in your complacence with the technology behind your art.",1393487220

You still have to decide how rows returned are converted back to your golang objects, deal with nils, relations etc, all that logic has to go somewhere, and it&#x27;s not in the db drivers.<p>The problem with ORMs is not with just storing data, that&#x27;s pretty simple and you don&#x27;t even really need an ORM for that. The most difficult problem comes when you introduce complex relations, and need a way to retrieve those datasets from the database. AFAIK golang does not help you in any way with that, so you&#x27;ll have to invent your own ORM and conventions for representing things like belongs_to, has_many and join relationships. If you have join tables you&#x27;ll be doing the relations yourself which is not always simple or performant - this is what ORMs are useful for.<p>Clearly ORMs break down in apps of a certain size and have their own issues (largely due to non-optimal SQL and/or a reluctance to break out of the ORM when necessary), but every app contains the sort of logic which is in an ORM, because it must map storage to in-memory and view representations.

(Do you get to keep your old number if you switch?)<p>- Since you are stuck with the cellular service they can pretty much charge you whatever they want during that time. Sure they gotta give you an incentive to renew the contract but as i see it the competition between carriers isn&#x27;t that much.<p>Now here&#x27;s how things work in my country:<p>- You buy mobile independently and then pay for the service<p>- You pay the service typically below 3USD for most users. And it depends ENTIRELY on your usage. No usage = zero payment.<p>- No contracts with the carrier. You get to switch at the drop of a hat.<p>- Thing is, cellular services mostly &quot;prepaid&quot; (post-paid is available but few users go for that). So you just pay the service in advance what you think will use and that is credited to your account. This doesn&#x27;t expire for several months so no worries about over-estimating.<p>- So switching a service = getting a simcard of that service, adding balance to it (which you can from any corner store).<p>- Oh they even let you keep the number provided by the old carrier so virtually no switching costs.<p>- Hence the competition here is unimaginable! &quot;Price war&quot; would be an understatement. They even keep giving incentives to inactive customers to plug in their old sim cards.<p>- Its so freaking affordable people buy multiple-sim cellphones so they can use multiple services at the same time (hence utilizing best of each provider)",1393485435

The NBA has a unionized workforce, with a collective bargaining agreement which sets salary minimums as well as caps, with all sorts of rules regarding compensation, employment, trades, etc.<p>Interestingly, an economist recently estimated LeBron James&#x27; fair market value at 50 million dollars a year, which is far above his 20m current salary (which is largely driven by the CBA to keep player salaries low).<p>Also, when you sign an NBA contract, most of it is guaranteed both ways. That is to say, a four year contract means you get paid for four years even if you get injured or your performance is lacking. The converse being, you can&#x27;t simply sign with another team for higher salary if you feel you&#x27;re being underpaid, underutilized, or under appreciated. There are exceptions, player and team options, but those are typically in the final year of a multi-year contract.<p>I don&#x27;t have strong thoughts on the general point of the article, but I thought I&#x27;d clarify some of the basketball background info, because I feel it&#x27;s somewhat misleadingly presented.

The NBA minimum salary for a rookie is currently over $500K a year and around $1M a year for a veteran with at least 4 years experience.  The $25K salary figure is misleading because they are taking into account extremely short term contracts for a handful of games.

A top-level athlete or ballet dancer will have a complete support staff around them which provides coaching, physical therapy, etc. They will spend most of their time practicing. Imagine how good programmers we could be if we were treated similarly! And of course, elite athletes are well paid in dollars too.<p>I guess the difference is that the numbers of players on the court is capped. Even if a good player is only (say) 50% more likely to score a goal, having the best player makes the difference between winning and losing, so it&#x27;s worth paying a lot. And the only way to get a good concert is to spend a huge amount of resources training one particular pianist.<p>With programming there is no cap. Rather than paying a particularly good programmer 10x as much, you can just hire 10 mediocre programmers, and they will probably get more done.

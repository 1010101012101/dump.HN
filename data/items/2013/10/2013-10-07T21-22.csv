It&#x27;s the desire for continual improvement and willingness to start where you are and improve from there.<p>Anytime you attempt to make a huge process shift you are tempting fate and risking failure. The short term drawbacks to huge change can often stifle the process before it reaches maturity. The trick is to work through the rationalization with the team based on current observable problems and lead them towards self-realization and analysis of their own problems.<p>Most people have ideas of how to make things better, but if you lead them towards the desire for slack, optimizing for the bottleneck, rather than maxing out everyone as if they&#x27;re all the bottleneck, then you can easily get from there to Kanban-like WIP limits. From there you can adopt other solutions as the problems they tackle are realized.<p>Smart people frequently arrive at similar approaches whenf aced with the same problems, but not always. Your team may find some novel approach that works better for your context, or they may go looking for options and find Kanban. But the goal should begin with being able to communicate process problems, ask how they can be improved, test the potential solutions, and adopt the best ones.<p>Unfortunately, the biggest hinderance to gradual process improvement (once your team is on board) is that software tools tend to offer a &quot;whole solution&quot; and don&#x27;t have the ability to grow with your team&#x27;s maturity, unless they&#x27;re writing it themselves.",1381182984

Even if they have, to date, inserted only $70,000,000 of counterfeit bills, the impact to inflation is minimal, and really it only hurts a few individuals here and there who aren&#x27;t able to circulate the bills. But how can you measure this impact, and, if we don&#x27;t fight it, what would its projected potential impact be?<p>Then I&#x27;m curious about these questions:<p>1. Is this the most cost efficient method to deal with it? It seems a bit silly, to me, as this is a game of cat and mouse, and those tend to be very expensive in the long run, if you want to win.<p>2. Would it be worth investing in a digital solution such that a bill could be copied, but only one copy of that bill can ever be recirculated, so you could &quot;back up&quot; your money, digitally, then re-print it somewhere else, but you could never spend it more than once, as a general solution to counterfeiting?<p>3. Would either of these actually save more money than just ignoring the problem?<p>4. 100% digital? Maybe not online as a requirement, but definitely tap your card to transfer funds to someone? Why do we still have paper bills anyway, with multiple demonstrated cryptographic protocols that could replace them entirely?",1381182945

Stick around a while and hopefully you can get to know everyone better and even become a part of the community that has formed here. As far as non-drug items go, it&#x27;s not that surprising. This is a niche market for things you can&#x27;t get more easily from places like amazon, ebay, and retail shops. There is an added cost to doing things the way we do, and at least for the time being, you&#x27;re going to be able to get legal goods more cheaply and easily from these other places. Eventually, we may win out because of our advantages over these other markets (e.g. vendors don&#x27;t have to pay taxes on their profits from sales here). From what I&#x27;ve seen, despite some problems like attracting scammers, the market has only gotten better as more people have joined in. More buyers means more competition among sellers in the form of excellent customer service, low prices, and quality goods. More sellers means an expanding array of offerings, which attracts even more buyers. So far, this is the virtuous circle that has driven growth here IMHO. More people and a diversity of opinions is a good thing, and I would be hesitant to lump our diverse community into two opposing categories. By and large, there is much more cooperation and camaraderie than conflict and I&#x27;m generally impressed with the level of discourse. Maybe you have a point, though. There very well could be a place for multiple similar markets that cater to different folks. In fact I hope that is the case. I&#x27;d rather Silk Road be the leading market in a growing industry, than trying to take on the establishment alone",1381182938

While I have a ton of blog design ideas, I lost a personal bet that I&#x27;d have them done by the end of September.<p>- I have had lots of posts backlogged over the past several months. I was starting to have a fear of posting due to the design of my older site.<p>- Octopress is wonderful, but to use it right you really need to be familiar with tagging your repos correctly / using a separate repo for your posts. I didn&#x27;t want to think about all this in addition to all my usual pickiness about the front-end design.<p>- I really didn&#x27;t want to fiddle with wordpress. This is a personal blog, not something I plan to delegate to other content writers.<p>- As glennf and others have mentioned, I didn&#x27;t want to use medium, or any other free site. I want my own domain to be used, and occasionally look at google analytics.<p>So far, I&#x27;m happy with silvrback. Liking how it properly scales images when I use refer to them within a list, Markdown is the first class  citizen, and psychologically I&#x27;m not thinking too hard about blog design for now. Yes, there&#x27;s some UX annoyances with the initial release of silvrback, but I&#x27;m sure Damian&#x27;s working on them.<p>Will I still be using it in couple years? Maybe not, but for a site that&#x27;s only got a couple posts and already gotten a couple thousand visits and mentions from sites like hackaday & packlite.tumblr in the past week I&#x27;m happy enough with it.",1381182486

He gives normal people what they want, makes them feel smarter and more confident analysing the world, and, most insultingly, does it without respecting the rules of conduct developed by academics. This really stings because the community itself has failed to communicate with normal people, but its members still feel like they deserve to be listened to because they <i>know</i> they are right.

6511405,comment,6510996,6510996,16,0,tuke,,,"If you ask me . . . :-)<p>The rhetoric of Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s work represents that of the &quot;new historicism&quot; in literary studies, which emerged in the 80s.<p>There is a common style to these works:<p>-- They start with a startling and interesting anecdote, and, basically, tell a story.<p>-- They leverage finding from various articles.<p>-- They use a lot of argumentative ju-jitsu. For example, when the author is going to basically attempt a kind of whopper, they will admit that there are some failing to the argument. The rhetorical tic for Greenblatt is to write: &quot;To be sure . . .&quot; to make the reader feel that, yes, there are other opinions, but I&#x27;m kind of right. Then they go barreling ahead with a highly contentious argument.<p>For Greenblatt and the literary historians who write about the past: Their claims are rarely falsifiable. Sometimes other scholars will say that the new historicists are &quot;wrong,&quot; but it is not uncommon for the critics&#x27; basis for their own claims to be equally frail.<p>If you asked Greenblatt, he might not claim that what is describing is &quot;true,&quot; but, rather, &quot;good to think with.&quot; For the past, maybe that&#x27;s reasonable.<p>But:<p>Gladwell is almost always talking about the present, and making claims that should be testable with a robust experiment. Very frequently, he will cite incredibly thin research (as Chris Chabris notes).<p>I think this is the essential problem:<p>Gladwell&#x27;s style is OK if you can&#x27;t really test the hypothesis (new historicism).
But if you&#x27;re talking about the here-and-now, you have to answer to a higher standard of argumentation.",1381181322

It&#x27;s an absurd idea anyway, but what if that coin was made and then lost. Someone says they&#x27;ve found it, but how do we know they&#x27;re not lying and have just made a forgery?<p>Assuming that all details of the coin (its exact elemental composition, dimensions, etc.) are publicly known, I thought a possible solution would be to take an electron microscope and image the grain structure[2] of the coin in a specific region (e.g. the eye of the statue of liberty? if that were on the coin). Then hash that grain structure (in a similar way to how one &quot;hashes&quot; fingerprints), sign that hash with a very-private-key, and laser etch the signature onto the coin. Since it&#x27;s not possible to recreate exact grain structures, it&#x27;d be impossible to forge your coin :)<p>Alternatively, you could probably introduce some specific radioactive isotope to definitively age the coin, such the time since the coin was minted could be definitively measured, and any attempt at forgery revealed, though I&#x27;m not sure how to make that work in practice. There are probably other solutions too, though I can&#x27;t think of any off hand. There must be things people do already to authenticate high-value &quot;natural&quot; objects such as gemstones?

Windows servers aren&#x27;t that much more expensive if you host in the cloud, and BizSpark makes it free for the first three years. What you want to avoid is being locked into SQL Server, and other proprietary things that get expensive.<p>To make it scalable you can use different types of storage where it makes sense, use CDN&#x27;s, etc, all the best pratices for making it scalable.<p>The best argument against building in .NET would be: How easy will it be to find <i>good</i> developers who code in .NET?<p>I sometimes feel stuck in .NET. I like C#, and I use OSS alternatives and generally accomplish whatever I need to. I see projects similar to what I build by myself bungled by consulting firms that employ teams of &quot;enterprise&quot; developers to build .NET solutions for a company that my employer partners with. I interact with and/or follow as many of the dev&#x27;s in the OSS .NET community as I can online, but I have never met another one in person. Because of that I feel like I&#x27;m alone. I don&#x27;t consider myself a great developer, but I&#x27;m the best overall developer compared to all the .NET dev&#x27;s I&#x27;ve worked with in the past decade. .NET isn&#x27;t bad, but the talent pool there seems to be really poor. I don&#x27;t know if the same is true in the non-.NET world. It could simply be that great developers are all working for the big & cool companies and startups. Maybe impostor syndrome keeps me from feeling like I&#x27;m good enough to jump ship over to those companies.<p>I think the stigma of .NET has some merit in some areas but is very exaggerated, and while it is prevalent in the dev community, it bleeds over into the business side as well. It actually even gets worse there because business users are even more prone to misinformation. Someone looking to acquire your company will say &quot;Oh, but it&#x27;s built in .NET. I heard that .NET is: slow/ is really bad / only makes websites with ugly fonts / costs 100x as much / etc.&quot; Some of the things they think are pretty ridiculous. Attribute that to the game of telephone that passes the exaggerated hatred for .NET from the technical community as information to the business side, becoming even more distorted on the biz side.<p>Some of the things biz guys think are rational too. For example they might be concerned about integrating your .NET stack with their ruby/java/python stack. That would be an unattractive proposal to many. Companies looking to acquire might also nix a  potential deal because their CTO will be uninformed about .NET. They will automatically think the code was bad, that you&#x27;re using viewstate and web controls and Sharepoint, and all the other horrible things that people hate about the .NET world. They might be worried about the licensing cost of SQL server. I see no reason to use SQL Server unless you are locked into it by an existing system.<p>If i were building a company right now:
- I would go ahead and build in C#. 
- I feel like I could find good enough C# dev&#x27;s if i needed to (rather pay senior dev salaries for 3 good-great C# dev&#x27;s than 5-6 guys who are 1/3 as good but cost 80% as much). 
- I would avoid SQL Server, and just design things to be able to use non-MS techs for the critical pieces like the databases/key-value stores, etc. 
- I would follow the best practices for perf/scaling
- I&#x27;d use a framework like ServiceStack or NancyFX.",1381179776

My heuristic is this: if a framework is giving you huge productivity advantages, there&#x27;s nothing stopping someone from figuring out how to GUI-ify/sugarcoat the parts you write as a good disciple of this week&#x27;s True Framework. After all, that&#x27;s what VB did: made it easy for non-devs to make a Windows GUI with a little bit of code. It will happen to webdev, and it will happen to iOS (usepropeller.com).<p>How do you counter this? Easy: specialize in something requiring hard-fought knowledge.

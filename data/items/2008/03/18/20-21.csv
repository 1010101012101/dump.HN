140159,comment,139847,139923,0,0,hugh,,,"I'm no expert, but it seems to me that reading stock charts is just a particularly unsophisticated form of statistical arbitrage, and that it _might_ work provided that nobody else in the world is doing it.<p>Real statistical arbitrage firms, as I understand it, work by looking at the historical variation in thousands of asset prices at once, putting them into an enormous covariance matrix, and using dozens of very smart mathematicians and millions of CPU hours to figure out which assets are likely to be currently underpriced.<p>That's how folks like Renaissance Technologies got rich. Unfortunately, as soon as the secret got out, other folks started doing it as well, and pretty soon the mispricing of assets got smaller and smaller, so they're in an arms race to find more and more sophisticated algorithms.<p>So I guess the point is that if mispriced assets are that hard to find when you have a hundred PhDs and a supercomputer, you're not likely to do very well just by looking at whether a squiggly line is currently above or below its recent average. All the easy money has already been vacuumed up.",1205871794

This is not what -O2 does. According to the GCC -O documentation...</i><p>-O2: Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported\noptimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. The\ncompiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining\nwhen you specify -O2. As compared to -O, this option increases\nboth compilation time and the performance of the generated code.<p><i>On the other hand, -O3 performs space-speed tradeoffs, and -O performs fewer optimizations. Thus, for these tests, I think -O2 was the best choice.</i><p>Uh...what about optimizations performed in the JVM (or, more specifically, the JIT)?  How do they compare?  How do you know that -O2 is the right choice, other than ""it's kinda in the middle between lots of optimizations and not many, so that sounds good.""?

I've never been very good at decoding GCC's error messages, so if I couldn't fix a test with a trivial modification, I didn't include it in my benchmarks.</i><p>What??  If you can't read GCC's error messages, I don't get any warm fuzzies about your ability to decide which tests compare the things you want to compare or not.<p>There's plenty more to be critical of here, but the above two really were the sore thumbs in this article.<p>/me gets back to <i>real</i> work and plans to dissect this more tonight",1205871600

I'd hemmed and hawed around my idea for months, but once I started building it, using it myself, and had a few friends as alpha testers, it became much more exciting to work on because I was making it for me.  I could see the incremental things needing to be done to improve it as opposed to just a giant mount of unformed and uncompleted toil.<p>I also like the idea of using wasted time to at least learn something.  Of course, the danger there I face is reading a new blog post that more elegantly solves a problem than I recently had and wanting to go back and refactor (or worse, rewrite from scratch).  As long as I can keep that in check and moving forward, it's great advice.",1205870953

140139,comment,139235,139605,0,0,zealog,,,"""The thought of wasting 4-5 months of my life like that scares me.""<p>I get that.  It is incredibly difficult when you look at it like that.  I have personally felt that pain of, ""So, who I do I take time from, my wife or my kids?""<p>However, in the case you mention, it is only 4 or 5 months of nights and weekends.  What is that, 30 actual days max?  Would you trade 30 days of the thousands and thousands in your life to be able to make something you are proud of and potentially allow you to spend all of your time doing what you love?  I know I would.<p>Obviously, thinking like that can lead to a workaholic, Cats in the Cradle (google it, young'ns) type existence, but with measured use of it and diligence at maintaining boundaries, I think it is possible.<p>I remember when I had a friend ask to me run in a 5K. Before that, I wouldn't run unless being chased, and even then... However, I realized as much as a pain as it might be, even being slow 5K is about 30 minutes.  No matter how painful, annoying, embarrassing, it is, that's half an hour. 2% of 1 day.  I decided right then that I could do anything for 30 minutes - and did. This is the same sort of thing.<p>You can do anything for 4 or 5 months and see what happens.  This IS your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.<p></pollyanna boosterism>",1205870691

7252309,comment,7251779,7252259,2,0,_delirium,,,"The overall technical/scientific ecosystem of Switzerland also looks like it will be at least somewhat damaged by this closure. US startups often start off as university spinoffs from NSF or DARPA-funded research (Sun Microsystems, Google, etc.), or as partnerships between universities and industry (a number of machine-learning/data-mining startups fit that category). The same is often true in Europe, just replace NSF/DARPA with the EU research framework (keeps changing names, but essentially the same). It gives large grants to multi-national consortia of universities and companies. Switzerland was part of the 2007-2013 &quot;FP7&quot; program, but they&#x27;re being suspended from the 2014-2020 &quot;Horizon 2020&quot; program, at least for now. Existing funded projects will be allowed to complete (funding is usually for 3 years), but Swiss institutions and companies won&#x27;t be allowed to be part of 2014 applications. That&#x27;s causing a bit of turmoil around here (not Switzerland) right now because people had planned to submit proposals with Swiss partners who are suddenly ineligible.<p>It&#x27;s possible Switzerland will cover some of the damage by pulling the money they would&#x27;ve contributed towards the EU research framework, and using it to increase domestic research funding instead. Will have to wait and see how that goes.",1392649043

7252165,comment,7251490,7251490,6,0,pallavn,,,"Thanks for letting us know your stance on this but you have got the reading wrong. Let us clarify.<p>When we say hobby projects, we don&#x27;t mean open source projects at large. We mean those charting libraries that an enthusiastic developer decides to build over a weekend, as a learning project, and release to the world. Developers in other organizations looking for a charting library come across it, pick it up and start implementing it in their applications. The initial results feel good, but as soon as the developer moves onto implementing advanced capabilities, they start running into product limitations, cross-browser compatibility issues etc. And when they go back to the creator trying to get a fix for it, the developer has abandoned the project because it was a hobby project for him and his day job is keeping him busy. At this point, if you want to stick with the same product, you&#x27;ve 2 options; either extend the project yourself, or find someone who can do it for you - both of which could be distraction for your main development, and delay execution for you.<p>We have been in business for over 11 years now and have seen a lot of players like this that come up, and hence our stance. As an enterprise, when you are building an application, charting might not be your core strength. And hence, when you are looking for someone to take care of that, you need to find yourselves an enterprise-grade charting component. Not only does that cover you on the product part of things and meaningful implementations that can inspire you, it also gives you extensive documentation, assurance that it will continue development and that when you have a tech query, you can go to a support team that will be there when you are running on a tight deadline and need a fix.<p>That being said, we are not against open source at all. A good chunk of our own development tools and infrastructure are open-source. There are some good open source charting libraries as well, which we have listed in a competitor comparison table on our website at www.fusioncharts.com/javascript-charting-comparison/.<p>Here&#x27;s a good read on when choosing a commercial library, instead of open source library, for a niche purpose makes sense - <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/581146/8-reasons-to-choose-commercial-library-instead-of"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/581146/8-reasons-to-choo...</a><p>But, at the end of the day, the decision is in your hand - for, developers are the king-makers!",1392646717

If you break that you get the symmetric key and can decrypt everything passively.  OTR has been using a 1536 bit modulus for its Diffie-Helman exchange since 2004 [1] (The weakest one from RFC 3526 [2]).  Seems they are still using the same one today.<p>In 2004 this was probably a fine choice, especially considering the tradeoff between CPU processing (usability) and security.  But considering the NSA scandal, specifically them recording all encrypted communications forever, and Bruce Schneier increasing his key lengths [3], and the ability for CPUs to process higher keylengths without any noticeable slowdown, I don&#x27;t feel confident it is strong enough today.<p>Other than this gripe OTR is amazing and everyone should be using it.<p>Edit: xnyhps&#x27;s post [4] concludes that only a single &quot;cracking&quot; of the 1536 bit group would need to occur to then decrypt any past or future OTR conversation &quot;instantly&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20041215062523/http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/Protocol.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20041215062523/http://www.cypher...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3526.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3526.txt</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6376954"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6376954</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://blog.thijsalkema.de/blog/2014/01/17/misconceptions-about-forward-secrecy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.thijsalkema.de/blog/2014/01/17/misconceptions-a...</a>",1392646658

Then I realized that to sketch from imagination, I need to understand the 3D structure of things, not just how they look from one side. So here&#x27;s some exercises I&#x27;m doing now:<p>- Drawing a lot of boxes, spheres cut in half, cones, other simple 3D objects in various views<p>- 30-second poses using Posemaniacs, and quick poses from imagination<p>- Head structure from imagination, like in Loomis &quot;Drawing the head and hands&quot; (available online for free)<p>The next problem is going to be color, I can already tell that I&#x27;m OK with structure but will need a new set of exercises for color and value, no idea yet what they will be. Can anyone who&#x27;s further along help me out?",1392646130

For many environments, a centralized VCS is all you need.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding what these extra &quot;costs&quot; are. I haven&#x27;t used SVN in a while, but I think the only extra cost is an extra command to push your changes to a repository.<p>Meanwhile, the advantages of a distributed VCS are huge. Even if everyone is developing on the same LAN it seems beneficial to have a DVCS. I&#x27;ve been on multiple projects where the centralized VCS goes down for a day or even a week. In that scenario everyone has to stop committing changes. Sharing changes with a coworker now requires making a patch file or some other cumbersome operation.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a situation where a centralized VCS is better for any team.",1392646062

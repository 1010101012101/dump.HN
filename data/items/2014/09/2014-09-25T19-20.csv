Then you can read notifications about suspicious links pointing to your site and disavow the ones that are spammy.<p>I am not so sure that you are under a link-based penalty. I know you did not ask for this, but I had a look at your website&#x27;s link profile, source and index health.<p>1. SEO: The online web form market is hugely saturated. You probably can not compete with Wufoo on terms like &quot;web form builder&quot;. Honestly ask yourself if you currently deserve a top 10 spot for this term. Are you a top 10 player in this field? Explore more specific and longtail keywords. Create better targeted pages and page titles. &quot;Documentation - NicSoft Software&quot; is a missed chance. Create more content on the blog (inbound marketing).<p>2. Links. You do not have enough natural links to beat competitors. They get linked from webdeveloper forums by real users of the software. You also should check out Google&#x27;s stance on &quot;Powered by&quot;-links. If this turns in the majority of your backlinking profile, you get links from a lot of bad neighborhoods. These links may thus do more harm than good. It is not an editorial link, but probably in exchange for a free version of the product. Much safer to nofollow links created for profit or SEO/online marketing purposes.<p>3. Site HTML is not well-structured for information retrieval. For every page on your site, the first heading is &quot;Home&quot;. Browse your site with styles disabled. Reorder repeating boilerplate code below the relevant page content. Specify a canonical or make sure only one version is served to visitors with redirects (both www- and non-www versions of the site return duplicate content).<p>4. Index health is poor. Robots.txt file is indexed. There are a few inactive subdomains, an unattended Wordpress and Drupal install in a subdirectory. Includes are indexed as separate pages &quot;/inc/footer.php&quot;. Documentation (the content &quot;meat&quot; if the site) is off limits for bots. Over 90% of pages on the site are in the secondary index, which is not a good sign.<p>About 10 hits a day from Google is far too low for any commercial site to survive on. You could get more than 10 hits on a random wordlist.<p>Do not solely think about in-links. Are you even linking to reputable sources yourself? End-node sites are far less interesting for visitors than hub sites.",1411674815

Why not use something that is performant with a history of successful apps behind it like Java?<p>It seems that everyone in web is just blindly following whatever flavor of the month tech stack tech bloggers who probably spend more time writing about software than they do writing software are hyping. CRUD apps(IE 90% of web based companies) are probably one of the most solved problems in tech. Why is it that every week there is some post by some inane startup nobody has ever heard of about &quot;why we rewrote our stack from Ruby/Python to X shiny new language that people use buzzwords I probably don&#x27;t even know the meaning of to describe&quot;? This sort of lines up with that post from yesterday I think about companies just wanting to push out the product as fast as possible rather than caring about the actual quality of it.\nWhy wait until you need to scale and hire 10 100k/year engineers to rewrite your app into a capable language and migrate it with 0 downtime instead of just doing shit right the first time? Seems like it would be a lot less headache, even if VCs were throwing piles of cash at you. Snapchat, for whatever other things you can fault them technically for like being hacked or whatever, did this right. They built on Java and deployed to App Engine and their application scaled right up.<p>I can understand extreme cases like Twitter(went from Ruby/Rails to Scala), where it was essentially a trivial CRUD application that eventually got so enormous that language performance features became an issue.<p>Also I don&#x27;t understand why web people are so obsessed with &quot;concurrency&quot;. How does concurrency help webapps that are just getting a request, doing some stuff with databases(which have their own well implemented concurrency mechanisms) and sending a response back so some tween can look at pics of their friends and send gossipy messages? Unless you are doing something that requires long running processes like video streaming or an online MMO type game, what is the point of it?

Oftentimes you finish up paying thousands of dollars for expensive tax help* only to demonstrate that your tax liability is $0 because foreign tax credits cancel out your foreign tax obligations. Besides all the difficulties with opening bank accounts as noted.<p>The solution is simple: the US needs to join the remaining 99% of the developed western world and switch to residence-based taxation instead of the current citizenship-based regime. In other words you tax people within your physical borders only (citizen or not), but suspend their tax obligations when they leave for as long as they leave, unless they still have income-producing assets within the borders of your country.<p>* Taxes overseas are not something you can just whip up Turbotax to handle. You oftentimes need to reconcile foreign tax statements with your US ones to compute tax credits. Worse, the foreign tax ones are rarely due on the same deadlines as the US ones, and foreign currencies need to be converted and so forth. The whole thing is difficult for most people but almost completely unworkable for entrepreneurs owning corporations overseas, owing to the need to file obscure and complex Controlled Foreign Corporation tax forms.

During the last decade the whole region has improved, so the economic situation in Uruguay is quite good right now (and the new government takes credit). But the worst thing is the way they&#x27;re squandering this money in sort-of-well-meaning but very badly implemented &quot;social&quot; policies, so when the &quot;up&quot; economic cycle turns into a &quot;down&quot; economic cycle and the easy money runs out, there will be no reserves, a disfunctional and violent society, truly pathetic education level [3],... it&#x27;s a ticking bomb.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/ninos-mataron-amigo-horror-maldonado.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/ninos-mataron-amigo-hor...</a> (two kids, 11 and 14, killed their 11 year old friend with a machete, and then went playing football)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.taringa.net/posts/info/15613143/Mujica-el-terrorista-tupamaro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taringa.net/posts/info/15613143/Mujica-el-terrori...</a> <a href=""http://diurnarius.com/jose-mujica-de-ladron-a-presidente/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diurnarius.com/jose-mujica-de-ladron-a-presidente/</a> <a href=""http://www.periodistadigital.com/opinion/politica/2009/11/30/peep-mujica-un-ex-terrorista-colaborador-de-eta.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.periodistadigital.com/opinion/politica/2009/11/30...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.montevideo.com.uy/auc.aspx?220385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.montevideo.com.uy/auc.aspx?220385</a>",1411674062

When they came back up, all of the relation columns in an entire production database for one of our client&#x27;s apps were magically deleted. This created a myriad of issues that we had to painstakingly traverse. To make it even worse, they have no true concept of backup and restore. Sure, you can backup and restore regular data columns and pointers, but there is no way to restore relational data through their data browser. Go ahead, try, it just errors.<p>If that&#x27;s not enough, they constantly change the way things work on the back end. Is your app working perfectly this week? Great, it won&#x27;t be next week. All of the sudden you could no longer check if an object was equal to [NSNull null] - the way I&#x27;d seen as a recommendation on their own forums multiple times, and something that was working perfectly until one day, it simply stopped working without any client or cloud code changes. This caused queries in a production app to suddenly start returning wrong data, and chaos followed.<p>As far as support, it has been a joke. We have reported showstopper bugs multiple times, and every time we are met with rude responses, followed by NO ONE addressing the issue for weeks, then the issue magically gets closed. I&#x27;m sorry, but if you can&#x27;t backup or restore data on their platform, they probably shouldn&#x27;t be spending so much time redoing your website every other week. It&#x27;d be nice if they&#x27;d fix mission critical features instead.<p>Lastly, the downtime and limitations. They go down literally 10 times a day for short periods. If you&#x27;re an active developer, you&#x27;ve definitely noticed this. The least they could do is acknowledge the regular service interruptions on their status page, and have some accountability for the slowness. We will be developing a data migration tool for people who want to escape this terrible platform, and the tool will allow for migration of their data to a MySQL setup. In the time we&#x27;ve wasted trying to work around their countless limitations, we could have build complete custom REST APIs for our clients.",1411673768

That can be a big deal. Having to gate-check your bag can be irritating if you&#x27;ve got things in there that you need, and the longer the flight, the more important this is.<p>Second, at least on Delta, the people who board priority have a separate line. That line continues to exist even after general boarding starts. The upshot is that, even if you board with everyone else, you can cut the line and not have to stand around waiting. If you prefer sitting down to standing in a line, then this is valuable and good.<p>Third, and related to #2, boarding early means you&#x27;re likely boarding with other frequent travelers. Those people are better to board with because they are quicker and more efficient, on average, about things like clearing out of the aisle, getting settled, etc. This means less waiting around and being jostled in the aisle.<p>All of this adds up to a much more pleasant experience.",1411672854

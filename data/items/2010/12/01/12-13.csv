So this person's post made more people aware of yelp and they used it to air their frustration, a bunch of people on reddit got mad and made up claims to make this company look like nothing more than a scam (one poster actually called for reddit to do exactly that) or some combination of those two.<p>I just posted this as a great example of about the worst way to deal with customers I've ever seen.  If the company isn't a scam they could have asked the customer what they could do to get rid of the rating.  If it is a scam he could have just shut up, maybe posted a few fake positive reviews and left it at that.  Instead he wrote an amateurish fake-lawyer letter <i>threatening</i> the customer angering a portion of the Internet against him.",1291208331

(Oddly, removal of <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> prefix isn't one of these things, I supported that...)<p>So I went back to firefox, albeit FF4 as MineField, and added in Omnibar and gTranslate extensions to get the functionality of chrome that I depended on (the combined nav bar and the ability to auto-translate web pages).<p>Haven't regretted it since, although I do keep a chrome install around as my backup browser - every few weeks minefield will have some earth-shattering bug that causes it to be unusable for a few hours or so..",1291208016

1957638,comment,1957354,1957354,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Bad explanations of the prisoners dilemma are a constant fascination to me. They pop-up in so many otherwise excellent bits of writing, imho, because the standard mental image of two prisoners being interrogated is such a mismatch for the actual dilemma.<p>For example, in this case he's talking about ""defecting by accident"", yet two paragraphs before he's just outlined the fact that ""the best solution individually is to defect"".<p>So you're ""accidentally"" following the optimal strategy, which is the same one you'd pick if you had perfect information about the situation. I fail to see how that's a problem.<p>The key to the prisoner's dilemma is to avoid being in that situation. Once you're in that situation, a situation that is fascinating precisely because you are so totally screwed once in it, the ""game"" is over. You (and your partner) only have one rational choice and it leads to a poor outcome.<p>Change the game when and if you can, that's the lesson of the prisoners dilemma (also, if you can't change the game then defect because the other guy should logically defect too leaving you high and dry if you try to cooperate and if for whatever irrational reason he doesn't defect then you get the best possible outcome by defecting when he doesn't).<p>To be extra clear, ""defecting"" will always gain you something in the standard Prisoner's Dilemma. That's kind of the whole point. In an iterated prisoners dilemma, where the guy you betrayed previously gets a chance to get even it's not so simple and gets more confusing if people hold irrational grudges. Interaction with colleagues obviously fits that kind of iterated version better as does pissing off your partner in crime who'll have you shanked in the prison showers as revenge for betraying him.<p>For a discussion about nerds needing to communicate better, leading off with a false technical analogy seems like a perfect way to piss the techies off and make them ignore the rest of your message, which all seems reasonable enough in itself and doesn't really need the reference to the PD and talk of defecting to jazz it up.",1291205958

1957634,comment,1957433,1957497,0,0,rednum,,,"Well, python is nice, but must algorithm competition (for reasons i dont really know) allow only C/C++/Pascal. Learning C++ seems to be the best choice here (though I don't like it), as usually you are allowed to use standard template library which comes with a few useful structs/algorithms.<p>I have taken part in similar competition (but not world class, though), and my advice is:<p>- learn c++ so you can express basic algorithms - creating an algorithm which solves task and not having enough time/skills to code it is extremely frustrating. However don't spend too much time learning the language - you probably won't need to write your own templates or do some advanced OOP stuff. learning python is ok too (personally I like python much more than C++) - it is really easy and cool, but you won't be allowed to use it anyway<p>- learn some maths, you will need it. You wont need arithetics or calculus - rather combinatorics or some number theory. Try to choose 'tricky' tasks rather than that requiring much computation - in IOI you are the one who thinks about tricks, and computer does the computation ;)<p>- read about algorithms mentioned in texts. learn about:\ndynamic programming (knapsack problem), greedy algorithms, trees and graphs (dfs, bfs, dijskstra, maximum flow, minimal spanning tree (kruskal-prim)), data structures (start with lists and binary search trees, then move to queues more advanced like interval trees - there are lots of interesting, both trivial and complicated structures), text algorithms (KMP, Manacher algorithm), computational geometry (sweep line algorithm, convex hull).\n- also, learning some tools - like good editor and debugger (vim and gdb) and some basic linux command line knowledge (e.g. when you test your programs it's better to redirect input from file than to write it each time manually) is really handy - it will make coding/debuggins much easier<p>It seems that there is quite a lot to learn - if you are a newbie to algorihtms, at the beginning I recommend learning what is algorihtm complexity - sorting algorithms are good place to start here. Then spend a while with basic data structs (writing your own linked list is an obligatory exercise here), then move to something different. Dont try to learn everything at once, rather focus on single subject at given momment. Personally I learned algorithms from 'Introduction to algorithms' by Cormen/Rivest/Leierson/Stein - I did only a few chapters on graphs/geometry/data structs but it was hard, I didn't understand most of the math - however many people I knew who were good at algorithms gained some kind of intuition whether something works or not or what complexity it has(obviously, you dont have time to write a proof of your algorithm during competition - also, it isn't necessary) and didn't use it too much - anyway it's good to grasp basics (so you can e.g. estimate complexity bounds to your solution). Also don't start algorithms by trying to copypaste them from your book to editor - try to understand them first (pen and paper are your friends here). However it is good to code at least once each of well known algorihtms as an exercise.<p>I mentioned cormen earlier - however this book is tough. Some of the algorithm tutorials on topcoder site (<a href=""http://www.topcoder.com/tc?d1=tutorials&d2=alg_index&module=Static"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topcoder.com/tc?d1=tutorials&d2=alg_index&#38...</a>) may be useful for you - topcoder seems also as a good place to start coding (however, imho many tasks in div2 are rather brute-force, requiring much time coding than a good idea). Participating in your national OI may is a good idea too - usually you can find some useful resources on its site.",1291205622

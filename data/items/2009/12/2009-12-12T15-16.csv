If there's global warming, what's the extent of it? How much is caused by humans? What are the pros and cons of climate change? And so on. These questions aren't answered, and there's recommendations for trillions of dollars of resources</i><p>My first thought (speaking as a scientist myself) was that <i>ofcourse</i> these models are incomplete.  Climate change is <i>difficult</i>.  Hell, predicting the weather with any degree of accuracy 7 days out is difficult.  To put together a cohesive document spanning hundreds (thousands?) of scientists and have them all agree with its contents seems like an almost impossible task for me to envision.  I have trouble agreeing with my own co-workers sometimes and we work on the <i>same funded project</i>!<p>The argument about spending the money elsewhere is complete bull.  Have you ever applied for government grants... lets say from the NSF?  The money is always globally appropriated and the grants are always applicable to many fields.  You don't get funded based on opinion. You get funded over a 30-40 page proposal that you clearly state your objectives and what you will use the money for.  Then you are put through a thorough vetting process where the granters look at ALL the proposals being made (undoubtedly there are hundreds) and choose the one that meets their criteria the best.  They also look at the track record of each of the groups based on prior research and the like.  On some governmental projects, they'll even tell you certain objectives that you propose which they <i>will not</i> fund.<p>People make the same point about stem cell research and it drives me crazy.<p>There is always benefits to funding basic scientific research.  Just look at the output from Fermilab and CERN over the last 20 years--MRIs and the Internet most notably.<p>But getting back to the climate change models.  These are enormous problems to tackle.  They have supercomputers chugging on data 24-7.  Just envision trying to track cloud formation to see if there is a pattern in storms-- you've got to find some way to <i>measure</i> all that and then you have to compute it to form a predictive model.

The surface facts that we know and can believe (detained and released) smack of punishment for some small slight.  His punishment (beating, citing for a felony a being immediately released) is completely consistent with many other cases of people saying the wrong thing.<p>Make no mistake, when you really do cross the actual line with a cop/border guard, you will pay with all the force of the law (and then some).",1260631922

The internet and tech community is extremely sci-fi and video game friendly. This was one of us, and bad things happened to him.<p>Second, it's not a news article. There's no presumption of being two sides to the story. One side is given, by a friend, and a call to action given out. Were the officers interviewed? Was the video-tape released (And you know they have video tape)? Nothing of the barest minimum was done to provide some sort of context. The purpose of this piece is clear: it's a call to action, an editorial, an opinion piece. Don't confuse it with a news article.<p>Third, there's lots of loaded language in here -- ""was subject to a beating and arrest"", and ""the gang of border guards"", ""and losing it may cost him his entire life"" etc.<p>Look -- I'm not taking sides. Border guards screw up and are badly-trained sometimes. That's why we have video on all border crossings. On the other hand, people crossing the border have been known not to be able to handle submitting to requests from people in authority for various reasons. There is a very good case for using physical force on occasion. I simply don't know what happened.<p>What do I do when someone starts singing sweet songs of injustice that sounds wonderful to my libertarian senses?

I believe your starting environment can have a significant effect on your progress.  If you pick something too obtuse and low level it may get hard to grasp some of the basic concepts you will need to master.  These days I'd recommend JavaScript since you can start quickly in the broswer without having to learn an IDE.  Also having the DOM to play with right away is fun, easy with obvious visual feedback that what you are doing is working (or not).  I'd also start simply with the basic language, from scratch (without a library).  Just learn the language and syntax.  Get the O'Reilly  JavaScript book make your dead simple index.html with inline JavaScript and see what you can do.  Only once you get the basics, migrate to a framework (jQuery's a good choice).  Oh, you'll want FireBug (or something similar too).",1260631785
991596,comment,991012,991481,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, I've been in and out of many countries in my time, including multiple times through Canadian customs and through the US border. I've been greeted by surliness before, but usually less than I get in a coffee shop or supermarket checkout from people who are being paid to be nice.<p>My first time into Canada had me dragged through the entire process. Questioned, threatened, bag searched, more threatening, etc. In the end the other officers were telling the one dealing with me to lay off, I overheard one say, ""He's got nothing, you've got to let him go through."" The man who searched my baggage was downright courteous, he even complimented me on my packing skills.<p>The first thing in the article that made me question WTF was when he got out of the car. In my experience with police, you <i>never</i> get out of the car until you're directly told to. Whether he was told to or not, I didn't get from the article. If he wasn't told to, that would have at least got him slammed to the ground and handcuffed.<p>This wasn't his first time crossing the border, so this seems a little erroneous. He should have known how to behave at a border crossing, what he did to let this occur is beyond me. I've been greeted at customs by four cops with MP5's (gotta love the Spanish hospitality), and I doubt a single one had less-than-lethal rounds in them. I acted courteous even though I was speaking a foreign language, the immigration officer was a bit abrupt but I let it slide. The captain, or whatever he was, of the squad asked how good was the book I was reading (a Terry Pratchett novel I believe it was) and wished me a good vacation.

Also, depending on the US state, and if it's in any other western country, animals have rights and injuring a dog is a criminal act, and when it's owned by a cop you can be sure as hell you'll be charged with animal abuse. If you're lucky, you won't be charged with both and won't be sued civilly by the officer in question for damaging property.<p>IMHO when a German Shepherd latches onto your arm and is attempting to force you to the ground, you do as it says. Also when there's a half-dozen cops (usually 1 for the dog team, and 2-4 cops called in for suspected drug possessions) shouting ""Stay down, stay down! DO NOT FIGHT THE DOG!"" then you do what they say.<p>Fighting the dog only does 1 of 2 things. 1st it angers the dog, which will mean it clamps down harder and will likely mean it breaks the skin (which it is trained not to do), which means any attempt to remove your arm can literally shred the muscle from your bone. 2nd if you're lucky and get free with your arm intact, running turns that highly trained dog into nothing more than a wolf, it will no longer bite your arm or try to pin you down, when it gets you it's likely to be going for the throat to kill you.",1260630682

And yes, I have read them.</i><p>You chose your words very carefully.<p>Emails (regarding AR4) were deleted. Phil Jones did say ""I think I’ll delete the file rather than send to anyone"". But yes, it's true no one admitted to deleting the files that later turned up missing.<p>It's not enough evidence to convict them in court, but it is enough evidence for the rest of us not to trust them.<p><i>No, the burden of proof is on those who want to show that the null hypothesis, that human-produced CO2 has the potential to cause direct harm through accelerated warming, is incorrect. The reason this is the null hypothesis isn't because the scientists say so, it's because it's the best physical model we have.</i><p>Your comment reflects a complete lack of knowledge of how the scientific process works.<p>a) Science can't tell you what the correct null hypothesis is. That's a completely subjective matter.<p>b) When engaging in hypothesis testing, the standard procedure is to take the opposite of what you want to prove as your null hypothesis. Trying to prove cigarettes cause cancer? Then you take ""cigarettes don't cause cancer"" as your null hypothesis.<p>If you are taking AGW as the null hypothesis, you are assuming that which you need to prove.",1260630082

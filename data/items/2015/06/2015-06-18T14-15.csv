9738926,comment,9736446,9738881,0,0,hoodoof,,,"I still think there is a healthy amount of teasing and there is too much teasing.  People can tell when it is too much.  Often people who were brought up in an environment with pervasive teasing (typically from siblings) do not have a sense of &quot;how much is too much&quot; when they become adults. The continue to tease beyond the point that is sensitive and healthy and fun - they are not tuned in to the impact of their teasing.  Others notice it though - like wives. Typically though the over-teaser dismisses such concerns.<p>This guy says &quot;biggest discussion my wife and I have is whether I tease them and push them too much&quot;.  I read that as someone who is not in touch with the fact that he is over-teasing, and is not effective at putting himself in the shoes of others to see and feel what that teasing is like.<p>When adult tease, they are carrying on the behaviour they learned in the family situation as children.  They have not learned that teasing is a behaviour either best left in childhood or strongly curtailed/regulated - it&#x27;s not an effective way to relate to people if you are an adult, does not grow relationships.  Except perhaps as described in the case of this article where a bit of teasing with the kids is fun.  A bit.",1434639594

This is because the system is trained as a discriminative classifier, and it never needed to learn this structure, since it was always present in the training set. This also means that the algorithm is going to be ignoring all sort of structures which are relevant to generation, but not relevant for discrimination, like the precise count and positioning of body parts for instance.<p>This makes for some cool nightmarish animals, but fully generative training could yield even more impressive results.",1434639565

Your &quot;O(length of string) version&quot; takes O(length of string) <i>per step</i>, not for the total time. To match an entire word (which you have to do to ensure that you have a match), you have to call step O(length of word) many times, so you&#x27;re back to quadratic complexity.<p>Also, it would have been nice if you had done your analysis with k as a variable instead of saying linear when you actually mean &quot;O(nk) for a very small k&quot;. Furthermore, if you have a maximum edit distance k, you can also implement the dynamic programming approach for a pair of strings in O(nk) time [1].<p>Still, your description prunes the trie nicely. It&#x27;s a nice and simple method that&#x27;s a lot faster than the naive implementation and good enough for nearly all applications.

Sites have a choice if they offer connections over https, it&#x27;s far from universal. By accepting http connections the site has indeed notified the browser that it wants to only allow secure connections. The problem is that a browser is refusing to connect to a server that has declared that it requires security but that it can&#x27;t connect to because the browser has implemented it correctly and the server hasn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t matter if that&#x27;s temporary or not, the message of &quot;I need a secure connection&quot; has been understood.<p>Perhaps the browser should have a fall-back to http button, in which case the server&#x27;s choice of how to redirect to https will be the deciding factor. I doubt many users routinely type <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> to signify that it&#x27;s <i>their</i> wish to only have a secure connection, so in this case it is certainly the server that&#x27;s enforcing it.<p>We need to move to TLS by default with no unencrypted HTTP, that can allow old crypto and unverified certificates.

You&#x27;re right: all data has some kind of relation - when we say &quot;non-relational data&quot; we almost always really mean &quot;loosely related.&quot; But some data is much more strongly related than others.<p>Think of a traditional RDBMS application such as an ordering system where there are strong relational constraints that need to be enforced <i>before</i> committing your data: ie, your <i>order items</i> had damn well better correlate with an <i>order,</i> which damn well better correlate with a <i>user,</i> or else nothing makes sense -- you had better raise an exception and should definitely not store those things in your database if the relational integrity is not there.<p>Now constrast that with other types of data collection where relational integrity is much more relaxed.<p>Generally, these examples would be (near) real time data collection - times when you&#x27;re collecting data with a &quot;collect first, analyze/correlate later&quot; mentality. Specific examples would be a service that aggregates logs from a server farm in real time, or things like tracking user behavior statistics on the web. Or even an onboard computer that collects data from a car&#x27;s engine - you want to read that data every 50ms no matter what, and maaaaaybe you will correlate it with events (accidents? combustion issues? whatever) later on oooooorrrr maybe not.",1434638389

What will your reaction be when Apple again makes a &quot;legitimate business decision&quot; and leverages the success to the benefit of their company and implicitly disadvantages other platforms? Maybe they double up on Swift support on Mac and start shipping additional features first for LLVM/Clang on OSX. Will you brush it off again as an understandable move by Apple?<p>This is not the optimal business decision anymore. Platform protectionism of this nature is not helpful today: customers expect their products to work across multiple platforms. Apple open sourced Swift because having more people use Swift is good for Apple&#x27;s developer ecosystem. Even if they use Swift to create programs for non-Apple platforms, they still know the lingua franca of Apple products and could easily develop for them. Programming languages are a dime a dozen; Swift as a language isn&#x27;t objectively superior to Java or Ruby or anything.<p>But ultimately, most people don&#x27;t write software for fun. They write software to make money, and Apple has a great platform for doing that. Yes, in order to make money on Apple&#x27;s platform, you have to pay Apple a cut -- and sometimes you have to write libraries to support certain features, and it&#x27;s up to you and your priorities whether or not you open source those libraries.<p>&quot;The community&quot; as you describe it has no power. So long as there is money to be made on iOS, there will be a deep line of companies looking to make a buck. And so long as Apple is the gatekeeper to getting your apps in front of iOS users, you have to deal with the fact that they treat iOS and OS X as their preferred development platforms.

Sure we could have <i>that</i> argument about advertising but Apple doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot of that and the advertisements they do create are hardly designed to manipulate you - not to mention we are comparing them to the Romans here...<p>> This is a wonderful sentiment to approach commerce with, but it&#x27;s all too easily forgotten when you&#x27;re already at the top of the game. To stretch my already two-dimensional metaphor, it&#x27;s at this point that empires start to stagnate, and eventually fall.<p>It&#x27;s not a sentiment, it&#x27;s the very essence of commerce.  If you remove that incentive (and decline to implement an authoritarian regime to organise by force, like communism) then you have nothing but a bunch of former bureaucrats twiddling their thumbs (and likely starving to death.)<p>Commerce is about trading things you have for things you want: no more and no less.  The problems of today are not the fault of freely organised trading by independent actors - that, instead, is the thing that brought us out of the stone age - but by the truly pain-in-the-arse implementation details of making this &quot;system&quot; moral and fair (define those terms however you will.)  The reason I&#x27;ve air-quoted &quot;system&quot;, btw, is because it is no such thing.  If the apocalypse comes and the political/financial system falls, and you find yourself holed up in some basement with a stash of weaponry but no food you&#x27;ll see that commerce is as natural as breathing.  We have literally studied magpies and chimps making what we would call <i>business decisions</i>.  Commerce is not evil, the system we&#x27;ve built around it is - I think this is the paradigm you have issue with, and it&#x27;s something you ultimately need to take up with the political system.<p>Apple&#x27;s success is owed to being good at this fundamental notion of trade, instead of gaming the system to their advantage (how many Fortune 500&#x27;s would fall with a fraction of the competition Apple faces?)  In order to fall one of four things would have to happen: 1) the entire system turns against them; 2) they stop being good at being Apple; 3) someone else learns how to do as they do or; 4) their actions ancillary to the product they provide me (like OPs points) become so offensive that they outweigh the benefits of being an Apple customer for a significant proportion of the consumer base.

  4     ____     no message
  5     100     Frame=5 x=100 dx=5      we can start displaying where things are

So we set our local state to what the server says and then step forward by 4 frames to get what we think the current state should be.<p><pre><code>  12    130     no message
  13    134     Frame=6 x=105 dx=5

We ignore this message from the server as it&#x27;s out of order (we&#x27;ve already received frame 7)<p><pre><code>  14    138     no message
  15    142     Frame=15 x=142 dx=4
</code></pre>
No need to do any stepping forward from this server state as we are in sync.<p>One thing to be careful of is that normally it&#x27;s not just a case of saying it&#x27;s 4 frames so I just multiply everything by 4 to get the new positions. With physics engines and more complete calculations you probably want to step the world forward frame by frame to get a better simulation of where everything is.<p>Hope that all makes sense.",1434637451

9738589,comment,9737230,9738323,0,0,pron,,,"That was before OpenJDK. There are a few ways you can license Java. You may freely implement it yourself, but then you must pass the TCK and abide by Oracle&#x27;s field-of-use restrictions, you may negotiate a license from Oracle (Sun at the time) for their source code and use of the technology, or you can do whatever you like with OpenJDK (although to use the Java trademark you probably need to conform to some other requirements)[1]. BTW, Oracle/Sun&#x27;s JDK <i>is</i> OpenJDK with a few advanced monitoring/profiling add-ons.<p>In any case, OpenJDK was released in May 2007, and Android unveiled in November later that year and made available only a year later. The reason Google used Apache Harmony was because they couldn&#x27;t reach a licensing agreement with Sun <i>and</i> chose not to use OpenJDK because of its GPL license, believing phone vendors would reject it.<p>As Google probably wanted to have a non-standard edition of Java, it&#x27;s unlikely that Sun would have licensed it to them (or they would have required a new standard being formalized first). Their best option was to use OpenJDK, but they didn&#x27;t. They wrote their own runtime -- which, to this day, is at a great performance disadvantage compared to OpenJDK -- suffers annoying incompatibilities and is a few Java versions behind, all in order to not use GPL software.<p>Was Google right in thinking that phone manufacturers not have put up with GPL? I&#x27;m sure that at the time that&#x27;s what the phone makers told them. Perhaps Android wouldn&#x27;t have taken off if they had tried to shove the GPL down their throats. But I believe that with the iPhone breathing down their necks and no better alternative, the phone vendors would have yielded. We would have ended up not only with a much better, faster, more compatible Android, but with the most ubiquitous operating system on the planet being truly free. This also would have prevented the Oracle-Google lawsuit.<p>Instead, we&#x27;re left with a slow OS that&#x27;s years behind embedded Java, not truly open (as closed-source modifications are made by vendors), and a legal battle that some believe may have far-reaching consequences. All because people are afraid of the GPL.<p>[1]: For example, I believe (though I&#x27;m not sure) that IBM&#x27;s and Aicas&#x27;s JDKs follow the first choice (maybe the second), Azul&#x27;s Zing JVM the second, and Azul&#x27;s Zulu the third.",1434636757

And note that the reason that fathering&#x27;s importance has been missed is basically that it&#x27;s not mothering, and scored poorly on metrics that measure mothering, with significant casual assumptions built into the system that mothering === parenting.<p>There&#x27;s no changes in science or technology recently that would lead to this being any easier to discover or quantify now. From a strictly scientific perspective, it&#x27;s actually quite shameful that only now is this being uncovered scientifically, and points to deep and systematic problems in the relevant disciplines.

Big companies have had the resources and time to iron out HR and management issues over their half century of existence...<p>When you look at it more closely, the Samwers have effectively managed to reallocate billions of dollars into startups all over the world in places where raising money, or working for a startup, was practically impossible. Remember the second largest location for venture capital funding, the UK, only receives about 1/20th as much as the Bay Area alone.<p>The more mature Rocket companies (btw Zalando isn&#x27;t, strictly, a Rocket company - it had a distinct set of actual founders) are now pretty desirable employers in their respective countries, and deliver relatively good customer service, certainly better than many much bigger and more resourced companies, and usually crushing the non-existent, overwhelmed service you can expect in most emerging markets. Is the backend a little messy and &quot;move fast and break things&quot;, sure, but I was surprised by how BAD most backends actually were in the business world period, and the codebases I had a look into were, by those standards, alright (for example: enforcing foreign keys! a luxury in the Era of Mongo and &quot;logic is in the ORM&quot;). What about the warehouses? Perhaps not quite Amazon, but definitely a huge step up from the average e-commerce startup. At least you know where your inventory is, you&#x27;re not somehow missing 3%.<p>Yes, Berlin can be a bit abrasive on egos. I left in part because of that, or at least it tipped me over the edge of setting up my own thing after dealing with one too many fake-angry German (hi H!). But with a bit of time and distance I really appreciate what the Samwers tried to do, and there&#x27;s definitely a lot of founders who got their &quot;change in life&quot; thanks to a few months/years in a Rocket company, making their mistakes at someone else&#x27;s expense.<p>It&#x27;s also quite impressive that Oli is still as hands on as he is, very numbers driven despite flying continuously around the world, spending less than a day in each business yet knowing their numbers better than their managers. I think the tone of the email, and his motivational speeches, is taken out of context; also, the &quot;vision&quot; is, when you strip the hyperbole away (in Australia: &quot;I do not want to be before the wave, or after the wave, I want to surf the wave&quot;), relatively accurate. By modern and especially American standards, he&#x27;s quite a polite fellow if demanding.",1434636000

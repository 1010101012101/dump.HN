We have found that pairing a physics person with a CS person leads to the best outcomes.<p>I think you should emphasize the things you are good at (probably modeling and data analysis) and not worry too much about the CS gaps There are a ton of opportunities out there for your skill-set.",1205019795

I just met a lead architect on a major personals site, and he noted that none of their success stories are repeat customers. Perhaps the ideal (evil) business model is to find people with a steady income and lots of hope but prevent their success.",1205019089

If we're solving a problem, there's always room. Who would have thought google would become the biggest software company in the world. Software moves to the web, and google is the leader in that world. Almost everyone uses goog applications in one way or another. When our startup is in the idea stage, many companies can emerge into our market, and we wouldn't have time to track all of them down.
If we have a competitive advantage, there's always room. We don't start a startup to be 20% better than the competitors; we start a startup to be 20 times better than the competitors. When goog started, there were excite, lycos, aliweb, altavista, webcrawler..., but goog came in and kick ass. If we have to know something about our market, make sure we know if the market is new, or declining.
Trust me, if we're solving a problem, and we have competitive advantage, there's plenty of room.",1205017781

Please note that I've enormous respect for both of them, as I've read most of the Norman's and 37signals's work.
Believe it or not, I still am at a loss to figure out the <i>philosophy</i> of their design. Even pg once said that he tried using Highrise and even took the trouble to email Jason but then again he was being arrogant. But what worries me is that people are still paying money for it. That said, best thing they have done is Rails, all other products are well hmmmmm (technically I somewhat like Campfire :-) )....",1205017465

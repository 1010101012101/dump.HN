What happens when you can instantly know what everyone else know? What will the hive mind be like?<p>However, it seems that at some point, if you didn't have enough factual knowledge stored in your head, that you could not fully utilize your creative capacity. Creative thoughts, in my opinion, seem to emerge from the application of one fact or memory or learned principle to another, in order to create new ideas.  Perhaps there is an optimal balance between recallable data and creativity.",1252979984

I think your second and fourth activities are the same, but one models abstract concepts, and the other models concepts of concrete things. I wouldn't bring in code reuse at this level; every practical programming paradigm tries to include code reuse. It's the mechanism that's a distinguishing feature, and the mechanism OO uses is a combination of subtype polymorphism and dynamic dispatch. It's a baked-in version of the function table / union|variant record idiom from procedural programming, and it has a transposed expression in sum types and pattern matching in functional programming: OO limits the addition of new (virtual) methods (on the base) but accepts the creation of new types (even at runtime), while FP limits the creation of new types (in most implementations I've seen) but accepts the addition of new methods (which costs some in discoverability in modern IDEs, and has namespace implications).",1252979292

Who decides what's fair? Treating everyone equally isn't necessarily fair: Forcing everyone to live in the same housing regardless of health issues certainly isn't fair but neither is creating a system that tries to balance individual needs into a sort of universal scale a such a thing doesn't exist.<p>Furthermore it misses the point that ethics is ultimately an individual issue as it's individuals who make ethical decisions. The moment that you have a bunch of people in clouds planning what the world should be like you've missed the whole point, which is 'what is justice?' which is an entirely different question, but 'How should I behave?' That is, Ethics is not so much the search for a universal code of action, but the search for a principles in human behavior.  With this realize that the search is not for a better means of wealth distribution but for the best set of virtues that a man can embody.<p>Thus the question is not whether Larry Ellison should buy another Yacht or immitate Mother Theresa, but whether he should practice is fortitude or his charity, his temperance or his, decisiveness.<p>Of course such things as universal codes of ethics come into play here, but they are tangential to the key issues.",1252979200

823044,comment,822354,822876,0,0,barrkel,,,"Ellipses have major and minor radii; in circles, both are the same length. Attributes in these kinds of objects are a bit of a red herring, though, as one set of attributes can be calculated from another, and vice versa. A circle can be described as a parametric function of angle, x = r * cos(t), y = r * sin(t); or the more familiar r^2 = x^2 + y^2. Which attributes you choose as the canonical, and which you choose to calculate, is just an implementation detail.<p>FWIW, I've felt for some time that the benefits of object orientation have been over-emphasized, though the general pattern of industry and language development has been moving in a better direction of late (say past 5 years).<p>I also have no well of respect for Uncle Bob - that's not to say he isn't a very intelligent, wise guy with lots of insightful things to say, it's just that I haven't read much of his stuff, and had never heard of him until a few months ago. But when I read him try to make an analogy between types in a program representing things in the world, and two lawyers advocating for a divorcing couple, and saying that since it's not the lawyers that are divorcing, you shouldn't model your types in an isomorphic correspondence to the things in the world you're modelling, well then, I think he's overreaching. If all your world is immutable rectangles, and you need to handle squares differently, and you're solidly orthodox in your subscription to OO, then I think modelling the relationship with inheritance is perfectly fine. In static languages, the fact that inheritance creates a subtyping relationship and introduces the possibility of polymorphism and dynamic dispatch is usually more interesting than the inherited scope of member lookup.",1252978618

Probably the least risky thing they could do with ticket trading is monitoring ticket listings in real time and buying ones that are listed below the prevailing market price, for events that are expected to have an increase in prices over time. However, 85% of events decrease in price as it gets closer to the event, until the last 48 hours which are harder to predict. Of course, the most money is to be made from buying from Ticketmaster at face value before events sell out.<p>Also, the secondary ticket market is very sensitive to momentum, so if SeatsGeek did a lot of trading they could unintentionally move the market in ways that cancelled out their profit.<p>They can make more reliable money from the affiliate fees on their sites. The prices for sold out events may vary by 40%, but the sites like Stubhub and Ticket Network take another 20% which makes it very difficult to flip tickets for already sold out events.<p>Something that often works better is short selling tickets for events that haven't gone on sale yet -- the price will crash down to the true market value after the market has more than a few tickets available.",1252978107

Perhaps they will win, though I'm not convinced. They seem to have setup a big hurdle they'll have to get over that we in the tech-web bubble like to forget; namely that not everyone in the world is so web and computer focused, especially in the market they are after. In fact I believe the Yext presenter stated himself that the businesses they talked to preferred receiving phone calls when obtaining business.

I didn't feel that there was a lot of innovation or the sensation that the software / products demoed would really make my life or others lives better.  It felt more like the presenters were taking problems that have already been solved outside of the web and trying to bridge the gap between the current solutions and online solutions. That's not to say doing so they won't be successful, but it did leave me feeling constantly disappointed, like I was being sold a bill of goods while having someone yelling at me about how my life will be so much better by using their service.

And their kids tend to go the same route, that is, they tend to end up on welfare. That might be sensationalist reporting of our newspapers, though. Also not saying that the solution would be to ""curb"" the birth rates - you might find a twist to make the kids fare better than their parents or whatever. I don't know - but it makes me wary about incentives and treating everybody equally. People are not equal - I wish for everybody to have a good live and a fair chance (and that includes if you are born dumb - which might mean you can't take advantage of chances, and it is not your fault - but then what if suddenly a lot of people are dumb - a ka idiocracy?).<p>Also, about the demographic curve - how come human history is a history of war, struggle and genocide?

You end up with more draconian restrictions on immigrants causing resentment. You end up with more distortion of market signals.<p>What happens when a startup goes under? Visa cancelled? Well that's reason to pour more resources in or just pretend it's still alive. What happens if they do some consulting on the side to stay alive? What happens if it ends up all consulting? What happens if people come out with the intention of doing this. How are you going to stop it? Force them to develop products?<p>What is a startup? Does a lawn mowing startup count? How about if they invent their own lawn mower? in 'The Founder Visa,' Graham proposes that the Governemnt could <i>""use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.""</i> Recognised by who? Do you really want to erect an official barrier to entry for investors?<p>What about an existing startup in country X that wouldn't mind moving to the US. Now they need an officially recognised investor. They don't need an investor. They need a visa. They can pay for it. The investor is in a position to sell a visa, even if it looks like he is just getting a good deal on some stock. It might even look like that to the investor. I offered a deal. They took it. The power to grant a visa is worth money and even if you can control the granter's morals or incentives (you can't), you cannot control the grantee's reasons for accepting a deal.<p>4 consultants doing remote work for mostly US clients decide they could double their (say $150k p/a) revenue by moving to the US and doing the same. Theoretically, they can afford up to $150k p/a for the visa. Say they take $100k ""investment"" form a recognised investor in return for a promise to pay $50k p/a. How would the visa process weed these candidates out. Review the business plan? Make sure that they are planning to build a business that scales? Consulting doesn't scale. Are you sure? Will we have a list of business plans that scale?<p>The article mentions setting up ""<i>a board of investors, entrepreneurs, and tech lawyers who are used to vetting tech ideas; they'd review applications and choose which ones are worthy of a Founder Visa.</i>"" This, it reckons, would be open to corruption.<p>I don't think it is possible to have ""controlled immigration"" that is this controlled to this extent without these ugly issues.",1252976846

Arbor kept me with a small raise, but put some effort into a breakdown of how much my equity would be worth under some acquisition scenarios.<p>I'd have been better off taking the Bloomberg gig in retrospect, but I liked the negotiating approach; it allows you to put your spin on the equity numbers (which I think is fair, because people are dumb about equity), while still being forthright.<p>Everyone in your company should know what ""the number"" is. This is just an extension of knowing the number; ""if we make our numbers, and then 2 years from now get bought, how much am I likely to make?""",1252976844

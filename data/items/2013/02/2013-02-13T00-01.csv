I would have hoped that it was clear: I was asking about the effect that being paid directly by the customer has on the performance and motivation of the teacher.

If I'd had that kind of money in middle school, I would have blown it on video games.  (I didn't know about GNU, I don't think the DOS port of gcc, the Allegro system, was yet born, and I didn't have any mentors.)<p>The source is messy and compiler-specific, and many implementations are irrelevant to modern systems.  For example, I recall Chapter 14 is about implementing multiplayer over serial cable by directly writing to I/O ports in assembly language to drive the UART.  I never did get that to work, but trying to translate the book from the Watcom C + MASM toolchain to the QBASIC + DEBUG toolchain -- without access to a working copy of the former and zero prior C experience! -- actually taught me a lot.<p>So maybe there is a reason toolchains should be expensive -- to encourage starving students with lots of time but little money to expand their minds by jury-rigging alternatives :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tricks-Game-Programming-Gurus-Andre-Lamothe/dp/0672305070"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Tricks-Game-Programming-Gurus-Andre-La...</a>",1360716878

The US is able to compete with China by taking advantage of Mexican labor. Furthermore, Mexico is a big market for american products. The ideal situation is to have american companies opening the Mexican market and at the same time take advantage of the available labor. There many advantages, the younger generation of Mexicans is very open and understanding of american culture(music, movies, sports, video games, clothing, etc) and they are willing to learn, travel is done as easily as traveling with in the US, times zones are the same, etc.",1360716787

They would sell you each additional wireless controller (and it would be sweetly designed, I suspect) for the standard $79 peripheral cost.<p>The primary contributor to their bill-of-material cost savings vs. competitors is that they already own and/or license at huge volume their CPU and GPU cores and know how to fabricate them in multi-core formats with high-speed cross-connectivity. They can also buy RAM and flash for SSD storage at better costs than anybody else. These are the primary cost drivers (basically money flowing to IBM, nVidia, etc for CPU/GPU and money flowing elsewhere for RAM/SSD/HDD) for xBox, PS, Wii.<p>Apple would have dramatically lower overall startup costs versus the original xBox/xBox360 and PS2/3 given they already have a toolchain and SMP operating system with sandboxing, an App Store and its back-end, user-accounts and payment infrastructure, and numerous other costs shared with the rest of the Mac and iOS ecosystems.<p>Apple wouldn't have a lot of work to do to train developers: tell us the screen resolution, how to interact with the controller and any other new hardware capabilities, tell us anything special about the GPU's and let us go to town with the existing toolchain we are using for iPhone and iPad.<p>So, again, I have no idea if they'll do it, I just think it would be a very profitable business for them.",1360716771

And of course that increases their productivity (messages handled per hour) and possibly even has an effect on happy customers per hour although that is harder to measure and seems less of a interest.<p>The net result are email responses that are indistinguishable from robots, and I suspect the systems would take an initial stab at which macros should be used for a response.<p>The real problem is companies rarely seem to take the effort to work out why people used email or call centres instead of self service.

This means they have to create a modern console platform AND sell it at the price of an iPad. I'm not sure how the ghost of Jobs will take the news once he finds out Apple is selling hardware at a loss.<p>Next I doubt they would have anything to gain other than ""you can now play CoD on the Apple ecosystem."" They would lose money on the hardware, they wouldn't make much on the software if App Store profits mean anything (<a href=""http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-07-11/tech/29964545_1_app-store-gene-munster-apple"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-07-11/tech/29964545...</a> reports they may have made ~$300 million). It just doesn't seem like a good idea finically. As far as the game console ecosystem goes I don't think MS/Sony/Nintendo will ever have to worry about Apple.<p>All in all, I am not really convinced that the App Store market will work for any of them. I strongly believe only Valve has the resources (and direction* ) to transition into the digital delivery era, at the expense of introducing yet another company into my living room. Still the question is how do you effectively deliver a magic box capable of playing Call of Duty at 1080p at the price of current consoles sustainably/profitably. Vavle's success so far doesn't worry about hardware. Their customers are either willing to spend $1000+ on a gaming every couple years, or just suck it up and blame Dell/HP for why their laptop can't play CoD.<p>* If Sony got their shit together, you are right, I believe they would take over the living room. They almost did it with PS2, and if the PS2 had come a bit later, or the PS3 was able to sell as much they might have done it. I think Sony could have built an Apple level brand loyalty (in the sense of having a Sony Computer, Phone, Laptop, Console) and (if they got much better at software development), they could have built a Sony store to manage your content on all those devices (after all they already own most of the movies and music).

5210495,comment,5208461,5208461,1,0,zanny,,,"I graduated High School in 2009. I want to tell a story about what my experiences lead to conclude the root problem is in public education and how NCLB impacts it.<p>My school was a public high school in a college town, so a large fraction of students were children of professors or college staff. The school did fairly well from local taxes so we had a lot of programs other schools couldn't dream of - for one, we had school provided Macs. Starting in 2004, every student got a laptop to use in class if a teacher wanted to use them.<p>I was in 5th grade when NCLB hit the scene, and experienced the <i>noticable</i> shift (though the causaution of this is questionable) I saw a significant repetition of topics to such a degree that between 4th grade (I was reading at ""12th grade"" reading level, had experienced everything up to algebra in math) and 8th grade, I learned <i>nothing</i> new. They were completely dead years. My middle school at the time went through a transition into this new model and structured around standardized tests that moved a significant chunk of the material I had covered in gifted / advanced classes years earlier into every classroom in reaction to the tests. That is the fault of the school though, and doesn't necessarily indicate a systemic issue.<p>The problem showed itself in high school, and presented itself in two ways - one, I took AP classes, and it was the <i>same</i> 15 - 30 kids taking <i>every</i> AP class. I had a few gen ed. classes (Spanish, Art, Technical Writing) where I got to experience an entire seperate <i>class</i> of student who were thoroughly disenfranchized with the system and being in school was wasting their time, and everyone elses. They were in the ""basic"" of the basic-standard-honors class placement, they didn't do the homework, they got D's/F's, and got pushed through an assembly line to meet quotas. Everyone involved behind the scenes absolutely knew this was a tremendous waste of time, but nobody did anything about it, mainly because it was systemic and inherent to compulsory standardized rote education.<p>I had some <i>really</i> good high school teachers. I got scores in 5/5 AP tests that placed me out of an entire semester of college courses and I graduated a year early with my BS as a result, combined with some extra courses to meet the credit requirement. They had <i>passion</i>. They were being <i>crushed</i> by the mass of the student body that wasn't in that select AP student group.<p>The laptops actually demonstrated something peculier - state assement test scores fell <i>dramatically</i> following their introduction. The school went from top 20 in the state to bottom 50. However, that select group of 30~ students (in a graduating class of 150, the school was delightfully small) were getting better scores than ever.<p>It is much more generic than this story, but from my experiences technology dramatically enhances the learning potential of an engaged learner, and acts as the ultimate distraction from the disenfranchised. The 80% of students who didn't care and didn't want to be in school used the laptops as a get out of jail free card, intentionally taking classes to get teachers that let them use them. The AP and honors tier of students had group collaboration projects, we make power points rather than cardboard posters, we would regularly look up bios and short stories of famous authors in real time.<p>That divide comes back to NCLB because the students that <i>want</i> to go further with good teachers that can promote that lose the capacity under a strict standardized testing regime. The year I graduated, the freshman class (the 4 years of ""honors"" students pretty much knew each other) had around half as many ""honors"" quality students in a class that was 200 students in size (133% the size of ours).<p>I think the perspective of someone who went through the NCLB origin years might be useful. I agree the article does come off as somewhat circlejerky ""kids these days just aren't as good as they once were"" in some aspects. But I definitely felt the impact of standardization strangling the good teachers and students and it made it blatantly apparent the root problem in public schools is that you are carrying around a majority of students who <i>don't want to be there</i>. And the solution to the latter is a harder problem to solve than throw more tests at them.",1360714557

To insure that the entity is respected (meaning it's assets alone are solely liable for satisfying any judgment) it's important to do at least the following (not an exclusive list):
1.  when you form the company, have a decent amount of capital in the company's bank account (yes a separate account in the company's name);
2.  make sure you follow all corporate formalities, including:
(a) regular meetings with minutes
(b) updated books and records containing minutes, authorizations/resolutions for company officers to act on behalf of the company, etc.
3.  Try to have more than just yourself as an officer (have more than one officer);
4.  Keep separate accounts and don't commingle personal and corporate money;
5.  Purchase a reasonable amount of liability insurance;
6.  Make all required federal and state filings (including employment development department, etc.)<p>I always get the feeling that lots of startup entrepreneurs get the impression that just setting up a corporation through an online provider is the end of the process, in reality it's just the beginning.

I've recently gone back to watch the classic Looney Tunes[1] and was surprised at how much satire was in them related to the 30s, 40s and 50s. It's the kind of stuff you would only really noticed if you studied the history of the era and are somewhat aware of the pop culture then. They were definently not meant for children, but the slapstick comedy and music draw in all audiences. Looney Tunes was my first real introduction to classical music. I would later go on to play Violin (probably somewhat influenced from Looney Tunes) for a number of years in school and still listen to classical music when I program quite often.<p>I don't know what happened to cartoons, but nothing seems to be interesting that's also geared towards children these days.

First of all, ""correct documentation"" might exist in an ideal world, but it rarely exists in the <i>real</i> world. Given this imperfect world, it seems prudent to use technologies and idioms that mitigate the consequences of this imperfection to the best that we are able. Of course no solution is going to be able to eliminate such consequences completely, but that's no reason not to use solutions that offer some benefit.<p>Secondly, the OP claimed that OO design is generally superior to functional design because it's easier to support overriding of behavior and it's easier to override behavior. Neither of these claims is true. In both cases, attention to detail is required.<p>Furthermore, in the OO case programmers using a class often fall into the attractive nuisance pit of thinking that just because a method is there, they can and should override it, and programmers implementing a class often neglect to even consider what might happen if a subclass overrides some methods. It's not just a matter of documentation; it's a matter of not even considering the consequences of providing this flexibility by default.<p>Additionally, when you <i>do</i> parameterize behavior using OO idioms such as template methods, the fact that parameterization is occurring has been obscured, while doing so using the typical functional programming idioms represents paramaterization as, well paramaterization.

We all know Google is incapable of decent customer support, and even if we do pay money for something like a phone, the very corporate nature that reigns in this company still sees us as products of free services. Here's a thought, instead of hiring outsourced help for their Nexus sales crew, why not use their AdWords support staff? Those people are obviously the only ones trained to deal with humans.",1360713692

On the same day our campaign was frozen due to a complaint from someone alleging we were infringing on their patent (we're not). It is policy of Indiegogo to freeze any campaign until the matter is resolved. Anyways, this is the letter we shared on our site. I'm curious to get feedback on tone, transparency, and clarity. Thoughts? Letter is up at centup.org",1360713665

5210425,comment,5209526,5209699,1,0,bathat,,,"> I'm always amazed at the quantity of people that show up on these to piss all over what is a pretty amazing project.<p>Well, I'm not here to piss all over the project (which is amazing).  However.  There are about four or five things I need a spreadsheet to do, which OpenOffice does not do and which MS Office does do (one example off the top of my head is generating polynomial regression lines on charts--I specifically need to generate quadratic fits).  I've found that many people are in a similar situation, but the things they need are slightly different from the ones I need.<p>So when someone posts a story about how OpenOffice is ""just as good"" as MS Office--or at least strongly implies that by claiming the value of a copy of OpenOffice is the same as MS Office retail--those people (like me) tend to come out of the woodwork and tell the other people (like you) the following: Although OpenOffice is a fantastic project, it just doesn't do what I need it to do. Which means that I am going to continue to forking over $90 to MS to get a spreadsheet (and word processor and presentation software) that does what I need it to do.",1360713634

5210421,comment,5208203,5208203,1,0,rlf,,,"Finally, something that I'm an expert in.  I've had Tinnitus in one of my ears for about 12 years.  When it started out, it was at a very high frequency but as time has passed the frequency has gotten lower and the sound louder which leads me to believe that it's getting worse.  The only way I've found to cope with Tinnitus is to try not to think about it.  At night, I've found that it helps to have a sound machine or fan running to help mask the sound.  As for Melatonin, I've taken it off and on for about a decade and have never found that it's reduced my Tinnitus.  I'm hoping that medical researchers will begin working harder to find some way to alleviate or even cure the condition since so many veterans are coming home with Tinnitus.  There are a few so-call treatments such as Tinnitus Retraining Therapy and Neuromonics but I'm skeptical about their effectiveness since they don't seem to have any scientific studies to back back them up.  There is a new device at TinnitusHearing.com that claims to mask the sound.  To me, this at least seems plausible since all sounds are just sound waves.  I would think we could create a device that is tuned to have a frequency that's inverse to your Tinnitus's frequency that would help mask it.  I could see this being very helpful at night when you're trying to sleep.  Hope this helps, and good luck!",1360713602

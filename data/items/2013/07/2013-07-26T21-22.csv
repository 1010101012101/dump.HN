I just SELECT. I opened a 30,000 row cursor, then, a 1,000,000 row cursor, and finally another 500,000 row cursor and got the data (while storing all of the fetches in leaking arrays)!&#x27; Usually on keys without indices or tables without primary keys.<p>SELECT a, b, c FROM abc (30,000 rows)<p>BEGIN<p><pre><code>  SELECT e, d, f FROM edf WHERE e = a (30k * 1m)

I was interested enough at one point to find out what all the hype was about. I&#x27;ve watched most of the seminal talks from Peyton-Jones and I&#x27;ve read numerous papers on Hindley-Milner type inference, category theory, monads... and perhaps countless more articles than I care to remember that extoll the virtues of the pain of getting your types right (in fact I think I&#x27;ve read it from numerous sources describing the experience as &quot;pain,&quot; but that, &quot;it&#x27;s worth it&quot;).<p>Weird.<p>In the end my conclusion, different and ignorant though it is, is that purity is over-rated and not worth the trade-offs. I prefer languages that let me be the judge of what is useful and avoid languages that make broad generalizations about purity, mutability, and types.<p><i>I pointed out that your broad claim is unsupported by evidence, and that my personal experience was directly contradictory.</i><p>And my experience is directly contradictory to yours. So what?<p>If we needed hard numbers to settle this I think we will find that the majority of web applications in existence are not written in Haskell. And if we take a survey of developers who build and maintain web applications about whether they would consider switching to Haskell I imagine very few would answer, &quot;Yes.&quot; I think they will continue to maintain and develop new features and applications without Haskell and the world will continue to turn.<p>Yes, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, there are other people out there like you. Sorry, you&#x27;re in the minority. The vast, vast minority.<p>There are a plethora of considerations to make when writing web application software. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever stopped and said, &quot;You know, I should wrap all of this in a state transformation monad and combine it the an IO monad and ensure that my entire program passes through my compiler&#x27;s type-checker.&quot; And I write large, eventually consistent data-stores without type checking... and most of the time they work!<p>I just don&#x27;t see why type checking up-front is such a huge deal.

6110819,comment,6110595,6110699,6,0,cdwhite,,,"This sort of stuff doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> the politicians in question to change their minds. Think of it as a two-fold selection effect. First, the candidate who <i>already</i> holds views of which the defense industry approves, receives campaign contributions therefrom and is therefore more likely to win. Second, I would think that defense companies are hardly likely to donate to a politician of the Ron Paul stripe when they are in a race against someone more ... conventional. As rayiner pointed out elswhere in the thread, correlation does not imply causation.<p>This mechanism may have deleterious effects on our political discourse and decision-making, but it&#x27;s hard to call something that doesn&#x27;t involve a politician changing his mind as a result of money &quot;bribery&quot;. This mechanism is a systems problem, it seems to me, not a problem with individuals.<p>Now I&#x27;m sure this is far from the only thing that&#x27;s going on. (In particular, I think I remember Lawrence Lessig talking about how money may or may not buy a change of views, but it surely buys <i>access</i>. You pick up the phone for the guy that contributed $LEGAL_LIMIT to your campaign.) Moreover, I haven&#x27;t ruled out that the money changed their minds---just provided an alternate hypothesis. Nonetheless, this toy model provides a not-totally-implausible explanation for things we observed, without invoking bribery.<p>Edited for style.",1374875806

In terms of externally observable behaviour they both prompt for inputs and then add them up. In terms of design theyre both infinite loops that maintain one item of state.<p>I understand that the example was written to show the State monad, and obviously the same externally observable behaviour could be achieved in other ways in this simple case. My point is that in imperative languages you get that State behaviour for free, and unlike the simplified alternatives to the Haskell that rely on recursion instead, such as the one you posted, the imperative state-for-free model scales up when you start to get lots of state and mutation going on. It doesnt start to suffer in performance metrics like speed or memory usage, nor does it start to have unpredictable performance characteristics in complex systems.<p>As Ive stated elsewhere in this thread, this argument is not meant to belittle Haskell or dismiss the clear advantages its model offers. Im arguing that there is a price to making those things as explicit as Haskell does, and that price is probably too high for mainstream industrial acceptance, so if were going to reap the benefits of the sound foundations on an industry-wide scale, they need to be available more transparently.",1374873416

One of the definitions would be using extra-market coercion to influence the price - see unions example - is not fair, since it uses forceful coercion to benefit one side. However, unions often claim they need the coercion to reach &quot;fair&quot; prices since otherwise it is &quot;unfair&quot;. So what is &quot;fair&quot; here? How you find out if voluntary agreement of two people is &quot;fair&quot; or not?<p>>>>> we have to destroy capitalism and abolish wage slavery.<p>Since the only other alternative that we&#x27;ve seen so far is non-wage slavery (at least until we find enough people that agree to work for free that we can create non-scarcity economy) this makes this definition of &quot;fair&quot; rather unappealing. The problem here is that voluntary structures tend to become markets, and calling non-voluntary arrangements &quot;fair&quot; has to rely on notion of fairness of those who apply coercion to support the non-voluntary nature, which very soon devolves into very peculiar understanding of &quot;fairness&quot;.",1374872475

That&#x27;s enough to make users look hard for any mistake, and can be done in about 10 lines of js, automatically whenever the email field loses focus. I&#x27;ve found even a very simple script checking common errors/domains has a significant effect on typos and bounce rates, and it has the advantage of not sharing the email and being a lot quicker. If you&#x27;re only ever warning the user to take a second look, you don&#x27;t have to worry about false positives.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that anything other than basic checks adds a lot of value, and I&#x27;d worry about sending off users&#x27; email addresses to an API on a third party website before they&#x27;ve even agreed to terms - I don&#x27;t think most users would be happy to find out that was happening.<p>It would be interesting to experiment with different levels of checks, and see which ones provide the most value though.",1374872440

It gets installed in the application folder and provides user with a clear API.<p>Here are the links:<p>- http://mac-r.github.com/highland/ (official website)<p>- https://github.com/mac-r/highland (Github repo)<p>- http://vimeo.com/55018195 (1 minute video about Highland)<p>John Nunemaker (the creator of mongomapper) once told me: ""I do not get it. When would you use highland over any of the other databases out there?"". You may ask me that question as well. Further is the answer.<p>The simplicity of highland is the core advantage. Now I am working on the datamining framework called Ajaila (http://ajaila.github.com/). There is a wide range of Ajaila users who are not familiar with databases at all.<p>They spend a lot of time to install MongoDB and other databases. Highland is  expected to be the first DB for such users (the default DB in Ajaila). It's extremely easy to play with it before getting familiar with other solutions.<p>I do believe that Highland can find its niche among existing DB solutions. At least it makes Ajaila users happy. Maybe there are other people who can get happy as well.<p>This is my first more or less finished opensource product. I am writing here to get your feedback. Maybe some of you will find this project interesting and will participate. There are many challenging issues.",1354959600

4891236,comment,4890858,4890858,1,0,benaiah,,,"The problem with replacing email is the fact that, unless you're using the standard email protocols, it's not really email at all. What needs to be done is to write a wrapper around the normal email protocols, and allow integration and interoperability with vanilla email that way. Then, you could write a new protocol if you wished, as long as the old ones kept working. If you want to replace email, you actually need to replace it.<p>I don't know if that's what you were already thinking, but thinking that they can make the world move to another protocol all of a sudden is a problem I see a lot of ""reinvent email"" guys having. That and building it so it only works with specific providers (usually just gmail) are big problems. (I use Hotmail, now Outlook.com, for my email, which is @ my own domain).<p>So, I think this could work, and I'd be interested in helping, but only if\n- It works on classic email protocols\n- It supports arbitrary providers (this goes along with the first point).<p>My suggestions as to features:\n- I really like the idea that alokhar mentioned of the unnecessariness of attaching a document. You could sort documents in different ways (types, who they're from) and list them along with email (which would be toggleable, for obvious reasons). If you need to send them, you send them with a stub email with some sort of markup in it that lets this service ignore the actual email, but is human-readable so it works with vanilla email.\n- An integrated inbox would be really nice - this would work well with the calendar/todo list integration. You could have some sort of human-readable, human-writeable metadata that would allow for various functions (setting a due date, etc).\n- Any email sent to an address by that address could be treated as a note - this would include todo-list entries (mentioned above), as well as just text notes. You could even sync these with external services (such as Evernote), which would be pretty cool.\n- The first image in an email could be used as its thumbnail in some views (or be overridable by the attributes described below)<p>These ideas hinge a bit on the idea of ""Markdown for metadata"" - some sort of obvious, flexible way to include metadata that, when read by a human, just looks like what you might write anyway. For example,<p><pre><code>  due: may 5\n  due: tomorrow\n  due: 2012-06-21\n  \n  task: development\n  \n  email type: attachment\n</code></pre>\nThis last one could be used for something like the stub emails I mentioned earlier, where a dumb email client would just ignore this and display the text, while a smart email client would hide the email and just add the atttachments to the inbox. You could include some explanatory text (""This is an attachment from johndoe@example.com""), but if this attribute was set to attachment, then it would be ignored by the smart email client. You would probably include a way to see these hidden emails anyway, to mitigate accidental invocation.<p>You <i>could</i> use a similar attribute for todo and calendar entries, but these could be inferred from other attributes in most cases.<p>In order to be as flexible as possible, you'd want to support many different aliases and formats (so I could, for example, write ""date"" or ""when"" instead of ""due"", and use any of the above formats).<p>These are just examples (the task would probably just be the email title, not an attribute - if it was an attribute, it would at least default to the email title).<p>I like the paradigm of having one line per attribute, with<p><pre><code>  <attribute> : <value>\n</code></pre>\nAttribute and value could be parsed on a case-by-case basis - see the several different date formats I used above.<p>You would use this parsed metadata to implement things like to-do lists, calendars, etc, and it would look like something you might type anyway.<p>Sorry, I've rambled a bit.

Even if all I ever did was sit in a room and <i>learn stuff</i>, I would never learn it all.  Not just that, but if I sat in a room and learned only the <i>interesting</i> stuff, I'd still probably croak from natural causes before finishing.  And even if that was all I did, why would I want to just sit in a room learning stuff if I never had time to apply it and build interesting things?<p>Maybe you learn faster than me.  So be it.  But, given all that--that I don't even have enough time in my life to learn all the interesting, no, fascinating, things that are so boring as to be considered the current scientific consensus--why should I want to waste my time listening to things that are likely to be bullshit?  I don't.  I don't have time for bullshit, and neither should you.

Distributing any kind of stuff for free has major economic impact, especially in poor countries where you replace or obsolete parts of the economy[1]. It's very common in the poorer parts of africa (Mozambique, Zimbabwe, ...) that people make their living of buying fuel at the gas station and reselling it by the liter for use in cookers and lamps or by collecting and selling wood.<p>A better way to go would be to validate the concept and find a way to produce the lamp and as much parts of it in the target communities, helping them to become self sustainable. The current idea just replaces local economy with earnings for a {american, european, chinese} manufacturer, effectively funneling funds away from the people that you want to help. So the goal is laudable, but I can't support the approach they're taking.<p>[1] other examples include food help which drives the local farmers out of business or donating clothes. Clothes often get sold for cheaper prices than the locally produced ones. Both may be useful in very specific circumstances, but are harmful in large scale.",1354958014

4891207,comment,4890788,4891181,1,0,ehsanu1,,,"Thanks, interesting! Not mentioned on that page, but a notable natural language which is similar in its goals is Lojban [1]. It's actually based on predicate language, which is actually what Inform 7 uses as well in order to derive the actual meaning from natural language sentences. It manages this because it is based on a limited subset of English.<p>But I'll note that we humans manage to understand each other just fine without resorting to a controlled natural language. We solve the ambiguity problem basically by taking the most likely interpretation of a given sentence, given the context, or asking questions if too confused. And in fact, there are natural language parsers out there that can predict the mostly like parse reasonably well for single sentences.<p>The biggest problem here is that programmers like having full control of what's going on, whereas this sort of idea brings in a large dose of unpredictability: how will the parser interpret this sentence? I think this can be solved to some extent by having the parser tell you what it parsed in less ambiguous terms. In fact, you might ask the parser to present a normalized version of the code that is more specific about exactly what's going on (and probably more verbose), and also expanding out phrases to show you exactly what they mean for debugging purposes. Also, when a clear parse cannot be made, the parser can simply ask you to clarify, presenting the multiple parses that it could not decide between.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban</a>",1354957975

You can't really expect a language with such a small group of speakers surviving the advent of the automobile and the radio for very long. And these languages did not die by a thousand loanwords: the young folk didn't learn them, and the old folk who could speak eventually died.<p>There is also another factor at play here.

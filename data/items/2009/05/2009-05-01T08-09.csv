If you'll get an extra 6 months' vesting with the cliff, ask the new company to pay you an extra signing bonus NOW, with which you can buy N shares of call options at a strike price of S; N being the number of shares you'll vest in 4 months (6 months minus July and Aug), S being the same as your options' strike price.<p>If there's no options market, you'll have to guesstimate.<p>There should be other opportunities beside this offer?",1241168175

588274,comment,588187,588263,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Once again, I don't think it's mutual self-deception. People see that agile principles work. Some don't understand how it applies to their job. Some, quite frankly, view agile as a bunch of new age, feel-good crap. In a big organization, life is about compromises. That can look like self-deception, but it's not.<p>I'm not a big corporate guy, even though I work with them, so I understand the freedom of getting out. When I'm in startup mode I'm about a hundred times more happy and productive than working in a large group.<p>But corporations still exist, and people still need to work in them. Some people <i>want</i> the imagined security that things will not change -- that they can punch a clock every day and work at the same place for 30 years.<p>Now you and I know that stability is an illusion, but it's one that people cling to.",1241167794

Threads in what is pretty much an event driven language, make very little sense. What operations 'block' in js? Threads encourage sloppy inefficient programming.<p>If you start 20 WebWorkers, and it's faster than having 10, you have to ask some serious questions of the interpreter/VM.

588268,comment,588139,588139,0,0,chops,,,"A very clever way to go out.<p>It instantly reminded me of the story of when Carmack and Romero decided to go on their own after they were working together at Softdisk.  At the time, there were no side-scroller games for PC for performance reasons.   Carmack (20 years old at the time) had an idea, I believe it was about shifting the pointer of the display (or something to that effect), that allowed smooth side-scrolling enough to emulate the effects of the NES. He stayed up all night, and left a floppy at Romero's desk for the next day.  When Romero got in the next day, and played the disk, Romero pretty much said ""That's it, we're outta here"" and from that initial engine was born Commander Keen, and the beginning of the legend of John Carmack.<p>It's been a few years since I read the book ""Masters of Doom"", so some of the details are hazy, but I thoroughly recommend it.<p>Carmack's genius is just out of this world.<p>Edit: Factual Correction.",1241167315

588262,comment,587271,587271,0,0,Tichy,,,"Interesting, but in the same sense you could say ""there is no such thing as waste"", because in theory everything could be recycled somehow (and if we have no use for it now, we might find some in the future - just as the article states about some of the radioactive waste).

588259,comment,588224,588224,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I went shopping for a laptop a few days ago, and checked out the MacBook Pro 15"", which is $1738 at Club Mac (and that's after a $150 mail-in rebate).  I instead ordered a Dell Latitude E6500 for under $1250 (plus $50 for a Mini 9 netbook, which was available in a combo deal), equipped with twice the RAM, the same CPU, the same disk, a magnesium alloy chassis (not as pretty as the Mac's aluminum, but not bad and very light), same resolution LED lit display, similar dedicated video card, backlit keyboard, a 9 cell battery (reportedly ~2.5 hour longer battery life than the Apple), web cam, roughly the same weight, roughly the same height (1"" vs. 0.95"" for the Apple), and more ports.  Oh, and a three year pretty comprehensive warranty.<p>So, Mac OS X tax = ~$488, and I would have gotten less RAM, and deal with a rebate which I seem to never actually receive even when I remember to fill out the forms and stuff.<p>Just saying...the MacBook <i>is</i> a fine looking machine, though.  This Dell is reportedly hackintosh ready, too, but I always end up just using Linux, anyway.",1241166720
588258,comment,586782,588046,0,0,weavejester,,,"Hold on. Why is a stack based language any less able to do that? If anything, it's closer to your ideal, as it has less inherent syntax than Lisp.<p>And for that matter, why do you think Clojure is so awful? It has no reader macros, true, but it does provide a more succinct way of writing hashes and vectors than most other lisps. Other than that, well, it's a Lisp.",1241166685
588257,comment,588187,588241,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I produce software on a regular basis. And I'm also one of those high-priced gurus you mention.<p>It's not black or white. Organizations are full of good, intelligent people who want what's best for both the people and the organization. It's just that everybody has a different idea of what that is.<p>I wish it were as simple as ""adapt or die"" but many times it's ""adapt enough and survive"" which means big companies do a little bit of everything.<p>And it's the agile true believers that are many times behind this make-agile-just-another-heavy-process movement. Take a look at the various lists for defining if a team is ""really"" doing scrum or not.  Read up on what some of the practitioners want to do. The agile community is doing a lot of this to itself, large organization or not.<p>So big companies pay us gurus to come in and try to change everything. And then nobody wants to change. And nobody gets fired if people miss a sprint. And everybody wants to perfectly define what agile is. And upper management wants to start tracking what metrics make ""good"" teams and what make ""bad"" agile teams. If you're lucky, you improve productivity by 5-8 percent using whatever generic agile principles the teams can accept.<p>That's a winning preposition for everybody. Doesn't feel great, and there is no break in the clouds with sunlight streaming in and music playing, but from a cost-benefit perspective it's a worthwhile cause.<p>Yes, agile is full of wonks preaching TDD that haven't coded in 20 years. Or analysts with 2 years of experience apply agile with a checklist. But that's where the movement is at right now -- it's spread from emphasizing delivery to being a little bit of something for everybody.<p>I wish it were as simple as you say.",1241166597

588251,comment,588187,588187,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Pretty good.<p>Nice observation that organizations are simply taking the old command and control and factory mentality and trying to make Agile fit into it. But, of course, it's not vague ""organizations"" that do this, it's all of us. As technical people, we naturally drift towards wanting to define more and more exactly what something is -- we want to program the people. We think that by continuing to define exactly what is agile that we're helping more than harming.<p>I also take issue with the discussion at the beginning that pits ""Software Engineering"" versus Agile. This is broilerplate agilista bullshit. If you're converting a conversation into something useful you're using Engineering techniques. That's the whole definition of Engineering - moving from spec to value in some kind of organized way. And that way can be formal, informal, conversation-based, etc. Duh. Now what you might <i>think</i> of as heavy engineering is a different subject -- but those are just deployed flavors, not the true thing. You can't argue that agile is cool but the way organizations are doing it suck without (hopefully) realizing that software engineering is <i>also</i> cool but just done in a really sucky way at times by those same organizations. It's the same difference. So I think making this false choice shows a real immaturity/lack of deep applied knowledge on the part of the presenter.<p>Maybe it's just me, but I'm also getting tired of seeing that same old manifesto crap with every agile presentation I see. It's not the Ten Commandments. Get over it. If you're spending 60 slides to explain what agile is, then that's your presentation topic, not how agile is being applied. I guess I liked the conclusion but thought the build-up was overly done.<p>Overall it was worthwhile to see.",1241166105

588241,comment,588187,588187,0,0,gruseom,,,"The fact that agile would be overrun by bureaucrats and vendors and thus turned into the same old bullshit was not only predictable but predicted from the outset. The new bullshit may not be quite as bad as the old, but it will take decades if not centuries for the real principles of software development to be worked out at a macro level.<p>A big part of the problem is the myth of ""organizational change"" that is endlessly propagated by consultants and enthusiasts. I've seen fathomless amounts of time and energy spent on trying to do this. It is largely poured down a drain. Inefficient, anticreative organizations don't change, except by dying. The idea that they can somehow go through an enlightenment experience and become productive places that are good at making software is extremely seductive. People are willing to put a lot of money into it and there's a steady supply of gurus happy to take the other side of that bargain. Note that the gurus don't produce software themselves, they just talk (at high hourly rates) about how <i>you</i> should do it. From what I observed (and I saw a lot of it) this is mostly mutual self-deception.<p>The way we will get better at software overall is not by ""organizational change"" in the places that suck at it, but by starting new organizations (e.g. startups) to provide new outlets for creative energy, some of which will succeed and render the old ways obsolete.<p>Happily, the situation at the individual level is not as gloomy as at the macro level. We are free to do things differently if we want to.",1241164909

Even if you make a few mistakes, it won&#x27;t lead to catastrophic failure.  Don&#x27;t worry about work.  Save your money dutifully, and go to your kids activities.

The assumption seems to be that older people who are hardworking and exceptionally intelligent are likely not to be conversant with the latest technology/programming language du jour and therefore have nothing to offer.

6756956,comment,6754918,6756427,2,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>I&#x27;m not convinced that any technology exists today that will be so set-it-and-forget-it wonderful that companies should plan to build it now and leave it the hell alone for a decade.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re making an implicit assumption that a LoB application must be built with a single technology.<p>The recent fast pace of technology development has demonstrated that specifics come and go, but foundations can remain stable for much longer. Data portability matters more than code portability. Open formats matter more than open source. Communication protocols matter more than whatever is on either end of them.<p>If I were trying to implement a major LoB application with reasonable longevity today, I&#x27;d go back to basics and plan the software architecture with that goal in mind. Ideas like modular design and separating interface from implementation might not be trendy in a world of web frameworks and &quot;living standards&quot; and processes that are described as &quot;Agile&quot; but really just mean not bothering to plan anything properly. However, those basic principles are as valuable today as they ever were.<p>There is no reason an LoB application using a SQL-based data store running on Linux servers and accessible using tried and tested mechanisms like sockets shouldn&#x27;t easily remain viable for decades. Probably the most you&#x27;ll ever have to do is upgrade some front-end technologies to keep up with whatever devices and software platforms your people use to access the system, but that&#x27;s easy.<p>The problem with a lot of these legacy intranet applications that have relied on successive generations of proprietary browser plug-ins isn&#x27;t the dependence on the plug-ins themselves, it is that they didn&#x27;t really have that kind of clean separation of responsibilities. Business logic was coded up in the front-end, so when the plug-in became obsolete, a core part of the application&#x27;s logic was left in limbo. Communication was done by sending custom formats over home-grown protocols, so when new technologies came along, all of these formats and protocols had to be reimplemented from scratch and often without a proper spec.<p>It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s ever been a secret that these tactics were likely to cause maintenance problems sooner or later. The people who planned ahead still have in-house applications that work just fine. Hopefully the people who didn&#x27;t will at least learn from their mistakes and know better next time.",1384808281

6756945,comment,6755817,6755817,7,0,summerdown2,,,"I worked in a company that changed their old, legacy office block for a brand new open plan one. Everyone was out in the open, and though there was an obvious hierarchy of seating, most of the desks were unassigned and changed ownership each day. The floors themselves opened out into a huge open space, and all the meeting rooms had glass sides.<p>I have to say I wasn&#x27;t a fan. There was a lot of background noise, and it was very difficult to have a private conversation. I constantly felt like someone might look over my shoulder (a problem if dealing with sensitive documents), or interrupt work I&#x27;d struggled to get focussed into. It was also hard to have private conversations about sensitive topics without having to search for a space away from everyone&#x27;s desk. Previously we&#x27;d just talk about stuff without moving.<p>My biggest frustration, though, was the fact it was very hard to be anything other than corporately bland in our attitudes. When we were split into floors and rooms, it was much easier to laugh and joke, and I often saw people bring something in to announce someone&#x27;s birthday and make a fuss of them.<p>After going open-plan, it seemed the only way to celebrate anything was to interrupt the entire office, which put a large dampener on it.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue that if you tend to be introverted, open-plan offices can be exhausting.",1384808207

As evidenced in this thread, there are also many &quot;missing&quot; bitcoins (lost wallets), which further increase the scarcity of whole bitcoins. Assuming BTC gains traction. As it does, the limited resource will be spread over a larger and larger group of people. Each person will have a smaller amount than what would have been possible were it still limited to just thousands of people in the economy. If only 21 million people participate in the economy, 1 BTC would be the average per participant, 10x increase and 0.1 BTC would be the average. The median will be much lower as bitcoin itself does nothing to address wealth distribution issues, so if you retained 1 BTC from the early days, only considering the number of participants, its value is directly proportional to the number of participants (individuals, businesses and states).<p>TL;DR - 1BTC is not quite infinite, but <i>assuming</i> the bitcoin economy becomes established and grows to a reasonable size, 1BTC today will be a small fortune in just a few more years (possibly sooner, but that&#x27;d be due to hype, IMO, rather than real value as a currency).",1384807413

But a business is not a charity it&#x27;s a business. And it needs to hire the person that (from experience) will stick around more than a short period of time. Doesn&#x27;t mean the manager was right about him. But we have to assume that his judgement was based on what he ran into in the past in similar situations.<p>And the example he is giving is for dramatic effect anyway.

Raising the minimum wage either increases costs everywhere or makes jobs less available.  In short, I don&#x27;t pay the guy that mows my lawn enough money to live off of.

He&#x27;s not making any more money off of me, at least, not without it being an incremental increase.<p>I don&#x27;t know why Wal-Mart should be expected to pay their employees a &#x27;living wage&#x27; at their own expense.

From the essay:<p>&quot;So Fedco, while it still has a bit of the cooperative flavor, is mainly organized around the other model of bad corporate governance: control by contractors (essentially, employees). To be exact, most of Fedco&#x27;s decisions are made by its civil service.<p>As a general rule, an employee-controlled enterprise will never, ever be profitable. In fact, even its bondholders are lucky if they see any payments. The primary interest of contractors is, first, if they can get away with it, in distributing profits to their own pockets; and second, if they can&#x27;t, in expanding or at least protecting their own power bases. They will make as much work for themselves as they can get away with.<p>Of course, even the CEO of a company is a contractor. This is why corporations have boards, who work for the shareholders. (In my opinion, it&#x27;s an abuse to have any corporate employees, even the CEO, on the board.)<p>If you combine a shareholderless governance model with an enormous revenue stream, you have the perfect recipe for massive and permanent inefficiency and incompetence, and an enormous overgrowth of pointless, self-serving tasks.

This comes through innovation, creativity, a highly skilled and motivated workforce....""</i><p>This is what most of the Western world wants, yet it is very difficult to achieve this - largely because of education. Most of the West, not just America, wants the bulk of it's jobs in high value-added positions because of labour costs arbitrage which many companies are forced to engage in because of intense competition. Where education is concerned, some people don't want to go to college, some aren't suited to it and well, funding education is <i>damn expensive</i> and the pressure on politicians to cut educational spending (which takes a long time to payoff) is huge. So you are never going to get all of the workforce in the country to work in high value-add roles, for various reasons.<p>I was fascinated by this interview with Andy Grove, because I had read an interview with Craig Barrett (current as chairman of Intel) who took a largely polar opposite view to what Grove has said in this article. Barrett was talking about how Ireland must change in order to move out of recession. I think he would be appalled at the notion of the US entering into a fully-blown trade war with China, as Grove advocates.<p>Barrett quote [on Ireland]: <i>What I said is that [having] smart people (good education) is important, smart ideas (investment in research) is important, and then letting smart people get together with smart ideas to do something is the third thing (the environment).</i> The very same could just as easily apply to the US.<p>Full article here (a very good read): <a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0212/1224264272768.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0212/122426...</a>",1278064307

1480648,comment,1480582,1480582,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"That is a nasty linkbait-y retitling. As far as the Helium Privatisation Act goes, the government was being accused of ""waste"" in 1996 when it was sitting on a vast stockpile of helium (from prior military uses.) It decided to sell it off over a controlled period so as to not depress the price excessively and put private suppliers out of business. They gave themselves the deadline of 2015 to have it all sold, presumabley so as to reduce the government debt in a reasonable time frame. [1]<p>Now it seems that helium is much more valuable but the price is depressed because this stockpile has to be sold by 2015. So something that made sense at the time now doesn't, and a new act is needed to say they can take longer to sell the helium. Government fail? Only if they don't change the policy.<p>Oh, and the HPA almost unanimously approved by Congress (411-10, with 12 not voting.) [2]<p>EDIT TO ADD: I am grumpy about this because titles like that generally go with the articles along the lines of ""nasty government interfering with the market."" But in this case, the report wants the government to be the government, to act strategically, not to sell at the market price but above it, and generally to interfere. The 1996 Act stopped the government doing its job in order to cut perceived waste and debt. The act should never have passed congress in the first place, or at least not in such a fixed way, but it did because it fitted people's stupid, prejudiced narrative that the government is too ""big"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.helium.com/items/874929-understanding-the-helium-privitization-act-of-1996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helium.com/items/874929-understanding-the-helium-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/104/house/2/votes/137/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/104/house/2/vote...</a>",1278063795

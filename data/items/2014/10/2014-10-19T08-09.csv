8477676,comment,8475809,8477317,0,0,beagle3,,,"First, it is not equivalent - next() cannot apply to range() output, for example - you will need to do some iter() games and watch out for iteration order side effects if your values are iterators vs. lists.<p>Second, it is ~10% faster, but that speed difference disappears completely if you eliminate the namespace lookup (that is, add e.g. &quot;o = r.append&quot; before the loop, and call o() instead of r.append() inside the loop). It potentially uses less memory - but not the way you did it (unless Python 3 gained TCO when I wasn&#x27;t looking. Did it?) - your formulation does not load the call stack, but it does create len(iterator) generators that - until the innermost StopIteration - all need to live somewhere on the heap. recursive solutions without TCO are rarely good enough to replace iteration.<p>Even if you did it right, it&#x27;s more efficient, but not significantly so timewise, and slightly easier to use iterators in general, yes. It is mostly space-efficient in general.<p>I think it is more idiomatic, though - and also Python2 compatible - to just replace references to &#x27;r&#x27; with yield in my code, than using the recursive definition you gave above - which is more idiomatic in functional languages, but less in Python (and harder to debug in any language than the iterative version)",1413708748

The nodes are multi-core and threads divvy up the work of rendering the image in tiles.  That&#x27;s not to say that production renderers can&#x27;t do multi-process renders too, but you don&#x27;t see it nearly as often as multi-threaded renders.  Remember that it can often take several minutes just to read scenes in; even if you split up an image into individual pixels and gave each node just a single pixel to do there&#x27;d still be a limit to how quickly you could get a frame back.  So if you parallelize across your cluster on frames, then yes, there&#x27;s usually several hours latency for a frame sequence, but you also get much better throughput.<p>By the way, if you haven&#x27;t heard of Blinn&#x27;s Law [0], you may find it interesting.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.boxxtech.com/2013/07/15/blinns-law-and-the-paradox-of-increasing-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.boxxtech.com/2013/07/15/blinns-law-and-the-parad...</a>",1413707434

Which is why we can get visuals as awesome as Jurassic Park on modern GPUs - while the hardware isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as the rendering farms used for that movie, other advancements allow us to achieve what are in many ways more spectacular results.<p>So, he may be wrong about what makes this happen, in essence he&#x27;s probably correct. In the time frame he outlined, I expect both Ray Tracing and Radiosity solutions on both hardware and software to match and possibly exceed what he has outlined in terms of capability.",1413706115

8477619,comment,8477241,8477241,0,0,yason,,,"Still wondering why make physical ignition switches that actually mechanically cut the flow of electricity.<p>For years, cars have been equipped with all kinds of &#x27;convenience&#x27; electric components such as Bluetooth, touch panels, and on top of that all critical elements in the engine have been controlled by an ECU for decades -- yet still only some cars have electrically, not mechanically, controlled ignition.<p>The car key doesn&#x27;t even have to be wireless: you could still have the lock and ignition key as now if you really wanted but turning the key would only give a signal to the car&#x27;s computer to wake up from sleep, authenticate the key, close the main circuits electrically to let the components start drawing the big current from the battery, and start booting sequence, self-tests etc. and eventually drive current to the starter motor to crank the engine up.<p>That&#x27;s a huge number of things to do, and it had best be left for the computer to handle. Pulling the key from the physical ignition switch is aking to starting and stopping your PC by pulling and inserting the plug from/to the wall socket. You&#x27;d better push the suspend button and let your laptop put itself to sleep and let it wake up by itself.<p>It&#x27;s also much easier to design a system that will handle startup and shutdown by itself, rather than a system that must survive opening and closing the main circuits at any time.",1413706088

8477605,comment,8477402,8477550,0,0,pron,,,"That is correct. The law is sexist, and women&#x27;s choices often are, too, as they try to meet the biased demands placed on them by a male dominated society. And that&#x27;s not my view, but the accepted definition of sexism. You should look it up - it&#x27;s a fascinating topic. As to the standard of proof, that was me trying to simplify things. It&#x27;s generally safe to assume that any discrimination against a non-dominant group is sexist/racist until proven otherwise. Speaking about choices is also often a cover for racism, as some groups are often nudged - gently or less so - towards making certain choices.<p>Once you begin looking at any discrimination this way, you stop taking certain things for granted, and start examining society in a very interesting way.",1413705696

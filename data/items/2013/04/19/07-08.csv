To accept more, except when compensated or in extreme circumstances, makes the engineer unprofessional. One comes to soon realize this. (See The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers (Robert C. Martin.)) Most companies, especially startups, don't. It's sad to think that the culture values high stress, long work hours with the inevitable diminishing return, and literally anything, no matter how unhealthy, to get workers to be slaves. At the same time, a lot of these companies have mediocre health and dental benefits with high cost to the employee.<p>Yeah, companies don't give a shit about you. And why should they? Corporations exist to make money. That's all. Your health, while in the long-term helps this goal, in the short-term it doesn't. The shorter the lifespan of the company, the less they care. This is easily observed.<p>The question is, why do you give a shit about your company?",1366358351

5575435,comment,5574368,5574368,12,0,kfk,,,"Please, bear in mind that Krugman has a very opinionated view against austerity (he seems to be going the Keynes way these days) and this article is not about Excel. He just wants to show how right he is and how sloppy the austerity guys are.<p>The way to compete against Excel is actually learning to love the tool (it took me 2 years, but I almost can say I love it... sometimes).<p>EDIT\nSince I am on HN, I always try to have a serious discussion about Excel and business software. That's why I always try to tie this kind of topic to my general idea: that we need to understand very well the type of work people do in Excel before proposing any solution.<p>But... if we want to talk about austerity, let's talk.<p>What is the real problem with anti-austerity measures today? We could accept a GDP/Debt ratio of 200, 300, 1000, infinity, and let people live their lives, right? Well, hell no. For 1 simple reason: interests. And I am not talking about the obvious problem with interests (that you have to pay them), but the bit that everybody forgets: they are a bet against the future that growth will be high enough to pay them. And that's the problem. We have a low growth rate expectancy (we western countries). And that's why serious economists (meaning: not Krugman) are telling us that increasing our debt exposure is the path to future ruin.<p>Now, you will say, but anti-austerity financed with higher taxes will bring growth! If that were true, we would have had serious growth the last 50 years (a period within which tax ratio on GDP increased pretty much everywere). The truth is that historically public spending has brought much less growth (if any) than private spending. Meaning: for each $ that we take away from privates to the public we are deliberately reducing present and future growth. And why public spending brings less (if any) growth? Well, simply because the market is so complex that we need multiple agents. Giving too many resources to 1 agent (the State) is like betting most of our money on 1 black jack game, does it make sense? No. You need to spread risk and resources, you need to let people make decisions and you need to let people keep most of what they produce.",1366358141

5575381,comment,5574429,5574891,5,0,tikhonj,,,"For UI code, you should check out functional reactive programming (FRP). It essentially provides first class time-varying values instead of implicitly modelling time with mutable state.<p>This makes UI code more declarative and allows you to create things like neat combinators. As an example, it's very easy to write a function like `when' with FRP, which could be used like this (code roughly from a game of life app I wrote):<p><pre><code>    when (not <$> paused) (step <$ time)\n</code></pre>\nHere `time' is just a stream of events every x milliseconds. So what this code does is create a stream of step events which represent stepping the life simulation forward at each time step, as long as the game isn't paused. `paused' is a value based on a button, but it could easily have multiple inputs.<p>So you get signals and event streams like `paused' and `time' from UI widgets (or the system), and then combine them into new streams that you can plug directly into UI widgets. This then lets the widgets themselves be much simpler structures with not internal state. In essence, this replaces arbitrary mutable state with an explicit dependence on time which leaves less room for making mistakes while also making it easier to write high-level functions like `when'.<p>There's a ton of other cool things you can do--this is just an example meant to illustrate the sort of abstractions you can use; it is by no means exhaustive!<p>I've found that FRP leads to much nicer UI code than callback-based OOP.",1366356849

If you are trying to figure out whether this is worth a read or not, I don't think you'll be disappointed spending an hour or two following along through the interview. For those of you that are tight on time, here are some heavily paraphrased notes I've been taking, referencing some of the more thought provoking parts of the interview. (And I'm only half way through! I'll need to finish reading this tomorrow):<p>- We should create human readable (memorable) hashes to map names to specific data, so people can trust the documents they have are not tampered with and so that such documents can't be removed from the public record. Sort of an immutable DNS system for data built on hashes. Readability is important so the keys can be transmitted independently of computer networks. Bitcoins may be a good reference technology for this. (See: ""So this Bitcoin replacement"" and passages leading up to that)<p>- We need secure, robust communication systems for medium sized groups of people (think revolutionaries) that don't need to rely on centralized (government owned) networks. Possibly use UDP to message someone (since without ACKs you can send to many hosts, and a listening host looks the same to the network as an unrelated host). More ideas about this in passage: ""Right, so you send it to random internet hosts""<p>- The internet lets one hear their own beliefs echoed back with such force that it drowns out any other input. It reinforces (makes extreme?) the person's original thought. This creates a ""radicalization of internet educated youth,"" makes us highly political.<p>- The US doesn't need to care as much about free speech since free speech won't change the fiscal outlook of those at the top (US is in a ""rigid fiscalized structure""). China and Egypt are a more political society though, so they still need to control free speech. (See passage:""I am not going to say governments"")<p>- ""censorship is always cause for celebration. It is always an opportunity, because it reveals fear of reform. It means that the power position is so weak that you have got to care about what people think.""<p>- Censorers don't care what information exists in darknets. They only care that their bosses don't find out about the darknets. (See: ""Even the censors in China"" passage)<p>- There is a second type of censorship beyond overt government censorship: ""Censorship through complexity."" Harkens back to the earlier discussion in the interview about the 'self-censorship' pyramid for journalists.<p>- Journalists should give all of their source data, not just choice quotes, so that people can make up their own minds. (See: ""scientific journalism"")<p>- ""Most wars in the 20th century have started as a result of lies. Amplified and spread by the mainstream press. And you go, well that is a horrible circumstance, that is terrible that all these wars start with lies. And I say no, this is a tremendous opportunity, because it means that populations basically don't like wars and they have to be lied into it. And that means we can be truthed into peace.""",1366356536

5575305,comment,5575144,5575144,26,0,kevingadd,,,"Employers, even the good ones, will put as much work on your plate as you can handle and then keep going. Systematically a workplace just isn't set up to help an employee handle stress, or even pay attention to an employee's stress level. They'll ask you to work overtime even if it is obviously killing you because that's just how the typical work environment is structured. Even moving higher up in the food chain, to be a producer or manager, doesn't change this.<p>You need only observe how many workplaces will let employees who are obviously sick with a cold/flu come in and work to understand how poorly most workplaces respond to an employee in trouble: They will not send someone home who is <i>actively</i> exposing coworkers to infectious diseases, so do you think they're going to notice if you're risking your health with stress? Sadly not.<p>So, as an employee, it's up to you: Pay attention to your stress level. If you aren't sleeping well, do something about it. If the stress is making you gain weight, do something about it. If you're having serious, serious problems, do something about it. You can't count on your employer to support you if shit hits the fan - even if it's their fault - because 99% of them won't. You have to be proactive.<p>You won't get promotions or raises for managing your own stress level and working reasonable hours, but you won't get promotions or raises for literally killing yourself either.

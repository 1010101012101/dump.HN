764610,comment,764535,764535,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Let me say up front that none of this is a criticism of Phil Schiller.  Just the opposite in fact.<p>But the bottom line is Mr. Schiller is a downright brilliant marketer (he’s Apple’s highest ranking Marketing executive for God’s sakes) and marketing is all about getting people to think what you want them to think.  More importantly Marketing is not about setting corporate policy (though I’m sure Mr. Schiller has the ear of Steve Jobs in a way that very few others do).<p>I guess what I’m saying is when you’re thinking exactly what someone as good as Mr. Schiller wants you to think you have to ask yourself whether it’s their marketing skills leading you there or whether something is actually happening.  What I see right now is a few well placed communications but no real change in Apple’s overall policies.",1250332482

A collection of Django applications which cover the common features of a variety of different types of sites, vetted for functionality/reusability/etc.<p>2. Some bits of glue to pull together the various applications for different types of sites.<p>So, for example, you want to build a social-networking site. Regardless of the specific focus of your site there's lots of infrastructure you're likely to need/want because it comes with that territory (user signups, ""friending"" and other relationships, profiles, ratings, etc., etc.). So Pinax offers a set of pre-vetted apps which provide that functionality, and some bits to make it easier to plug them all together.",1250332317

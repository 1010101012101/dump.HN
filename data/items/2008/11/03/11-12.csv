Somehow, I can't help but think Starcraft could be a useful if crude litmus test to divide people into social groups. I wonder if there are any entrepreneur focused lan parties...",1225713165

It is really exciting to see the quantum leap the brain-computer interaction field has taken in that time.  This can be done without any brain implants as well.",1225712476

This is, after all, what a beta is all about - to get out there, learn as much as we can, and iterate iterate iterate.<p>Thanks for being brutally honest, this is just what we want to learn!<p>Dave",1225711699

We see the same thing with some android handsets. Open source is freedom and creativity, we need to protect that freedom, if not, open source will die. Stallman understands this.",1225711267

Their solution was to move them to the public's balance sheet. Perhaps the real asset prices will rise and the financial companies will be wishing they didn't sell, but who are we kidding? The folks on Wall Street will be vacationing on their super yatchs as the American taxpayer is buried in the debt of their bad investments.",1225711235

Tourists aren't interested in when the next Linux user group meeting is! You need your own list of events updated from local knowledge. Half the interesting stuff is only advertised by people handing out fliers on the street. That means you need to pay people to gather this information for you, which has the knock on effect that you can't cover the whole world, just the bits of it to which lots of tourists go. Isn't this already obvious to you?",1225710640

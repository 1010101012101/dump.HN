Instead of always using tedious import and require statements, simply call/use your functions, objects, gems, plugins, etc. directly and let the compiler and/or runtime infer from your usage which  you are referring to in the case of ambiguity. Only if the ambiguity cannot be resolved in this manner would the programmer need to be explicit. Intelligent metadata and indexing could also add a lot of power to this sort of system.<p>Currently even our best languages require a large amount of cruft and legwork that is only really necessary in those 5% of cases where ambiguity can't be automatically inferred away.

But if you pair an idea up with:<p>Idea + capital,
Idea + connections,
Idea + salesmanship,
Idea + passion + market opportunity + timing etc...,
Idea + hustle,
Idea + mentorship / experience,
Idea + proof of concept, initial customers etc,
Idea + market knowledge with a significant edge over others,
Idea + accounting / misc biz skills<p>or a combination of those...and then you should be able to find a developer that is able to see enough upside to work with an idea person. The default answer shouldn't need to be 'learn how to code' in most cases. My viewpoint is to not do what you're hopeless at in 99% cases. There's not a lot of leverage there - ideas like speed. It's more valuable to get better at what you're already good at. If you're stubbornly trying to learn how to code and design despite hating the process, you simply didn't exhaust other avenues that yield a more expedient route to launching whatever idea/vision you have.<p>I did go down the learn how to code/design/market myself route because it's fun to me and that's a form of leverage that gives a potent edge. But I really hate seeing people struggle because they suck at what they are trying to learn, don't enjoy what they are learning but yet are using such things as obstacles to be conquered that they falsely believe are necessary to succeed.

2580884,comment,2580383,2580383,1,0,olegp,,,"You already have this with CommonJS packages and modules as used by Node, RingoJS, Akshell and others.<p>The latest additions to require() mean that if you do something like require('foo') and there's a directory 'foo' in your require path that contains a package.json file (i.e. if you have package foo installed via the likes of npm), then the main module mentioned in that package.json file (which contains the meta data Joe speaks of) is immediately available to you. The module isn't a function, but rather an object, but then JavaScript isn't a purely functional language.<p>Now, admittedly, currently you need to pre install the packages, but there's no reason why require couldn't be modified to install them for you if they're unavailable or, if your code ran on a platform like Akshell, the packages wouldn't already be available to you.",1306260361

There was a comment thread on HN a few months ago about this as well (no way we'll be able to find it now, I don't remember the story), but it summarized my views very well. I like knowing what is or isn't being installed on my computer. I've got a bash script to automatically download and update to the newest Firefox, so the act of upgrading isn't a chore. But I don't want a given company, be it Google or Mozilla, to arbitrarily change what's on my computer.<p>That's not to say I don't see the allure of automatic updates, but I just don't want them to be silent and mandatory.",1306260312

I also wrangled with the issue of encapsulation. I now know exactly how modules should work, what they are good for and why we need them ;-) And why you cannot have proper modules in Erlang without radical change. I am currently writing up these ideas in the spec for the new version of Babel-17 (v0.3) and implementing them. An implementation of Babel-17 that has modules will be available in about a week.",1306260145

2580862,comment,2580176,2580506,1,0,owenmarshall,,,">I do also think that the survey is flawed in that it doesn't track post-bachelors degrees. Psychology degree holders came in at the bottom of the list, but anyone who knows even a little bit about the mental health field knows that virtually all practioners have masters degrees or PHDs. So, yeah, if you just get a BA in psychology, you probably aren't making very much, not least because you probably aren't working in the mental health field as anything other than an entry level person.<p>As a study that compares bachelor degree to bachelor degree, this is still useful. To wit, I don't know of a school that charges more for a lucrative BS in CS than a less-useful BS in psychology,  nor one that charges less for degrees that can only be used as stepping stones.<p>That said, a study that includes post-bachelor degrees in the ranking would be interesting. What would be especially informative would be a combined ranking that factors the average cost of education in with the average earnings increase/decrease. Perhaps a masters in psychology still gets you less than a BS in mathematics, perhaps not, but it would be neat to see.",1306260005
2580861,comment,2579668,2579668,1,0,phamilton,,,"I agree with the article, but one thing makes me wonder.  Initially one reason that developers are hesitant is because the difficulty of the project is underestimated.  Layer, the author says to do it yourself, it isn't too difficult.  This seems to be a bit of a contradiction.  While I understand that easy is a relative term and agree that learning to code isn't too difficult, some may take that suggestion to mean that "" if I can learn how to do it, your skills can't beer worth that much.""  Not everyone will think that, but some will.  But I guess that's another clear warning sign not to work with them.",1306260000

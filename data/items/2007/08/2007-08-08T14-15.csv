Our application wasn't considered by ycombinator last spring, but the exercise of working though the questions has proven invaluable several times over the last few months.  In another job I've seen $300/hour consultants do no better for a group than that application form did for us - and we considered that consultant good value.<p>Sorry to be blowing sunshine.  But I'm sure you thought through that application form carefully and you should know that it's effective.",1186584987

40505,comment,40472,40472,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"This reminds me of ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" by Thomas S. Kuhn (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-Thomas-Kuhn/dp/0226458083/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-Thoma...</a>).  Kuhn dissects the idea of the ""paradigm shift"" in scientific thinking in the context of classical physics.  It is basically argued that it takes people who aren't indoctrinated with the ""old thinking"" to come up with the ""new thinking.""  <p>In physics, this usually turns out to be people younger than 26, often through seminal PhD theses.  But not always.  Sometimes people dabble in secondary fields at older ages and come up with significant breakthroughs, like Linus Pauling (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling</a>).<p>I'm not sure what I think about this regarding entrepreneurship.  It seems that very successful entrepreneurs are not always coming up with revolutionary thinking, but instead executing well and paying attention to small details that make things work where they haven't before.  As such, the age indoctrination barrier may not be as present as it is in physics.  But of course there are the risk and drive barriers--people get settled and less willing to take risks and go through the arduous process of starting something new later in life.",1186584202

I couldn't agree more but I prefer to classify people as either Ninjas or Pirates. My wife recently blogged about this and our friend Kathleen introduced a new variable into the equation: Monkey or Robot.

40501,comment,40472,40472,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I remember a Forbes article on a new small airplane business, featuring profiles of the 5 founders. The youngest, if I remember correctly, was in his 40s, and he was an accountant. The engineers were all old. There is very, very little innovation to be had in the airplane business (the US military is, remember, still flying planes designed in the 70s) and success is dependent upon age--which brings a tendency to 1) Not make fool mistakes 2) Understand horrendously complicated, but mature, technology, 3) Have critical contacts, 4) Have personal wealth to risk.<p>Something like...say...Twitter. What 50-year-old would even consider doing something like that? And if a kid does it, and botches it, no one gets hurt. Clearly the trade-offs between enthusiasm and experience are at work.<p><i>Dr. Simonton points out that the periods of Beethoven's career that had the most hits also had the most misses</i><p>I can't find that in the article. If by ""hits"" he means contemporary hits, perhaps. But Beethoven's late stage was both sparse, and choked with his greatest works. Compare that to rock music...the rolling stones' past 30 years can't compare with any 3 consecutive months in the 1960s.",1186583670
40500,comment,40412,40427,0,0,pg,,,"Actually, we consciously try to make this so.  We try to make the questions on the application questions that would be useful for a startup to answer, even if they didn't submit it, and we try to make in-person interviews de facto consulting sessions that would be worth the time even for startups that didn't get funding.<p>Obviously it's harder to guarantee the latter, but it's what we aim for.",1186583633

Either the VC is interested in having you in for a meeting, but can't because of circumstantial issues (e.g., scheduling), or the VC needs a few high-level questions answered in order to see if you fit the investment criteria and determine if he wants to invite you in for a meeting.

My tools were:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.texniccenter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texniccenter.org/</a> Great UI to get you up and running. You still type in LaTeX markup, but you can compile to PS or PDF very quickly.<p>2. OpenOffice to produce the images, which are exported as PDF. LaTeX has a way to include PDF files directly into the output.<p>3. For anything else, get a PDF printer and generate PDFs that way. You might need a PDF editor to set the bounding boxes properly though, so it will take some hacking.<p>4. For bibliography, I used a very hacked up system. EndNote allowed export in a format that LaTeX understood, except that it had a bug in the output markup. So I wrote a quick PHP script to fix that and add a unique, deterministic, ID for each reference so I can refer to it in the text. Worked a treat.",1267973987

After my wife and I moved from living at the beach (exp$ensive) to the mountains (equally nice, and much cheaper), Carol was able to stop working except for a few fun jobs and charity work, and I can afford to turn down more consulting jobs and spend more time writing. We have several people in our social network here who write fiction (ouch, a tough business!) and I'll ask them tonight if it helps them live in a less expensive area.",1267973976

People come and stay mostly for the winter months.<p>While they're there, there are all sorts of activities: woodworking, singing, crafts, etc. It's the hobbies that many of them have had in their life, and now they have time to fully explore them in a cooperative setting with lots of other people who are also interested in their hobby.<p>It doesn't take a genius to recognize that in another 20 years or so, a typical ""hobby"" is going to be web programming, application creation, or online business.<p>It's not going to happen soon, but at some point 20-40 years out we're going to see an explosion of highly-educated older people with lots of time on their hands and lots of life experience competing with the 20-something startups.

I especially don't know why they make $300M instead of $3M or even $3000. How does the product work? How is it sold? Who buys this service? Does it require heavy hitter sales people or are customers just entering their credit card number in to a web form? Do you just make up the prices as you go along?<p>Sadly, I believe my lack of understanding means that I'll probably never be successful as an entrepreneur.

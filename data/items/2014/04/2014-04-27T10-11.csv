7654637,comment,7653013,7653013,8,0,chrisdone,,,"I wrote (the start of) this page. Please bear in mind this <i>is</i> the Haskell community. We like our static types. This page is also kind of old news (2 years old) for us, the discussion is over, really. But I&#x27;ll describe the history of it for those interested.<p>So I wrote this paragraph (<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_JavaScript_Problem#Others"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_JavaScript_Problem#Ot...</a>) in 2012 in a reply to a reddit comment. Around that time the Haskell community was growing in its web dev circles, and we as a community were cultivating a sense that writing our web apps was not fun in 50% of the task, which was the front-end.<p>There were actually a bunch of alternative attacks.<p>* Using so-called widgets which are compiled by Haskell and contain very minimal pieces of JavaScript that the user of the library never sees. This is okay. But if you&#x27;re developing something more complex, you start to wish you were back in Haskell.<p>* Some were also thinking, perhaps it&#x27;s just the framework that makes this work awful, we just need to pick the right reactive-MVC kind of framework.<p>* Use HJscript, an EDSL of JavaScript embeded in Haskell. This is not bad, I used this in hpaste and it&#x27;s still running today: <a href=""https://github.com/chrisdone/lpaste/blob/master/src/Hpaste/View/Script.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisdone/lpaste/blob/master/src/Hpaste/V...</a> However, you&#x27;re still left with the semantics of JavaScript, it doesn&#x27;t really improve upon it. Although, if you&#x27;re interested in this approach, definitely checkout Sunroof <a href=""https://github.com/ku-fpg/sunroof-compiler"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ku-fpg/sunroof-compiler</a> which is like a new and improved version which has continuations out of the box.<p>* Some thought maybe CoffeeScript was enough, but it quickly becomes obvious that the problem is nowhere near syntax-deep.<p>In the end, I think everyone pretty much agreed just using Haskell would be better. But there were no viable transpilers, so we were continuing with JavaScript feeling that things could be better.<p>After that I decided to start trying out the bitrotted crop of compilers. I tried GHCJS first, and reported my findings: <a href=""http://chrisdone.com/posts/ghcjs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrisdone.com/posts/ghcjs</a> The first couple paragraphs are now on the wiki. I thought this community &quot;feeling&quot; should be documented, and copying “The Expression Problem”, thought it would be catchy to make a “The JavaScript Problem” post that is concise, opinionated and comprehensive. Ask any random Haskeller and they will pretty much agree with both paragraphs. It&#x27;s easy to point someone to a wiki article to have a common understanding of the problem.<p>I&#x27;m not one to simply whinge about things, however. I wrote down alternatives and tried a few out myself. I experimented with GHCJS (above) and UHC (here <a href=""http://chrisdone.com/posts/uhc-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrisdone.com/posts/uhc-javascript</a>) and HJScript. Eventually, unsatisfied, I wrote the Fay compiler: <a href=""https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki</a> which was inspired by the simplicity and small output of Roy and the FFI in UHC, and was a success (to some degree) because it was super easy to setup and its output was understandable. We&#x27;re using Fay at FP Complete for the IDE, we have about 16k lines of code in Fay.<p>In parallel, the GHCJS codebase got a new set of very active maintainers, the Haste compiler appeared <a href=""http://haste-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haste-lang.org/</a> and generally the community started to feel “hey, not only is compiling to JavaScript practical, but we&#x27;re starting to feel this should become standard web dev in Haskell.” If you look at the crop of Haskell web frameworks (big three are Yesod, Snap, Happstack) they all support compiling via Fay and I&#x27;d expect haste, too.<p>I see some comments in this submission that the Haskell community is &quot;snobbish&quot; and &quot;complaining&quot;. We&#x27;re apparently among the people who “wish JavaScript was something else” and we shouldn&#x27;t be one of those people, that we just don&#x27;t really “get” JavaScript and how to write it properly. We want a car because we don&#x27;t appreciate how to ride a horse properly. I&#x27;d say the opposite. Here we saw the problem (as we saw it), and started working on practical solutions and now people are getting paid to write Haskell that runs in the browser. If that&#x27;s not putting money where your mouth is, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>Also look at the OCaml community with <a href=""http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/</a> (also an inspiration for my endeavors) and the Clojure community with <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript</a> They identified the same problem and got to work. :-)<p>Since I added that wiki article, a bunch of new compilers and languages have been added to the page (or invented). For the chorus of people asking &quot;why isn&#x27;t X listed?&quot;, it&#x27;s simply because users contribute to the article, it was much smaller. So if you&#x27;ve heard of another approach, and, importantly, if you&#x27;ve tried it and can report practicality, please go ahead and add it. I think I&#x27;ll add Opa to the list, it&#x27;s like Ur in that you write front-end and backend code in the same language.",1398596012
7654636,comment,7652925,7654181,1,0,cornholio,,,"I don&#x27;t think the GP advocates a barter economy, rather he defines what sharing really is. If 50.000 people go to the stadium, there&#x27;s a large chance close neighbors go there so there&#x27;s no point using four cars when they can use a single one. No economic product is generated but our lives are suddenly better, less congestion, less resources wasted, etc. So the sharing platforms should find these synergies, when they exist, and you should purchase a transportation service otherwise.<p>What they actually end-up doing is competing the incumbent services in a fly bellow the radar illegal operation which actually makes the taxi drivers themselves poorer while diverting most of the extra cash to the ring masters.",1398595993

7654633,comment,7654392,7654392,5,0,wmkn,,,"When doing computer vision the first thing being done is usually camera calibration. The most common calibration technique is to make images of a physical object with know spatial properties (grid patterns are often used) and to extract 2D point positions from the resulting images (e.g. using a corner detector). Given the match between the extracted 2D points and the corresponding locations on the calibration grid it is possible to determine camera and lens parameters such focal length and distortion.<p>An in-house camera calibration application at my company solved the correspondence problem by using an algorithm that looked at properties that are not invariant under projection (i.e. angles and distances). This made the calibration process extremely fragile. The algorithm often failed to detect the calibration grid even when the image was crystal clear, which made calibrating a camera a very frustrating endeavour.<p>Since it was an in-house application there was never much priority to fix it. Eventually I got so annoyed though that I wrote a whole new real-time algorithm for the detection of arbitrarily-sized grids from a set of 2D points. The algorithm is capable of dealing with a significant amount of outliers (even when between the valid grid points), it can handle missing grid points and it is not affected by perspective or non-linear lens distortion. In the end it took me longer that I had hoped, but the resulting algorithm is one that still makes me proud.",1398595868

I think the nastiest thing I&#x27;ve debugged there was a machine that HP [1] was making in about 1994 which had some native HP bus and an EISA bus hanging off it for expansion cards from PCs.<p>I was working for a company that made NICs which went into the EISA bus and we were seeing data corruption in this machine.<p>After a long, cold night in the Apollo works myself and an engineer from HP tracked it down to a timing problem on the EISA bus where the 16 bits being sent were arriving in two 8 bit chunks slightly delayed. Our NIC was spinning on a 16 bit word looking for a change in the top 8 bits as a single that the data had arrived. We&#x27;d then read all 16 bits, but 8 bits weren&#x27;t ready yet.<p>Luckily, HP made lots of test equipment and getting a logic analyzer with 32 inputs, an in circuit emulator for the CPU, and some logic probes was easy...<p>[1] I think it was an HP 9000 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_9000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_9000</a> being made at the old Apollo works outside Boston.",1398595683

For every interrupt, the compiler would copy the entire (call)-stack to a different memory location, then enter the interrupt routine and finally copy the entire stack back, resulting in latencies of ±100 cycles before and after the interrupt. \nSo, to get rid of the timing jitter, we had to fire the timers early, and then wait for the final timer counts in the ISR.<p>Later, we switched to the NXP LPC platform using only open source tools: GCC ARM Embedded toolchain, OpenOCD + gdb for debugging and vim, make as &#x27;IDE&#x27;.

Most of the rants are about respect and not being willing to respect the specifics of the language. Why has JS to be built to suit test suites and tool chains originally designed for C/C++? Why not adapt those tools for the use with JS? Isn&#x27;t this, what a universal machine is for? &quot;Sucks&quot; may be an easy answer, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a general one.<p>Edit: There are only few high level languages which would adopt to such a wide range of programming patterns like JS does, or which would allow to be redefined by such large an extent. (This is mostly for the much frowned on late binding.) Isn&#x27;t this rather adorable than awful?<p>Other reasons, why JS would &quot;suck&quot; seem to be quite deliberately: Curly brackets -- what about C or Java? Semicolons -- In the beginning, JS was critiqued for not requiring them and using them rather as a separator (in the first syntax version). Verboseness -- isn&#x27;t the lack thereof why APL used to be quite a horror? Type coercion -- Isn&#x27;t this, what made Perl that useful as a glue-language?

Take weak typing / type coercion for an example: This is a common feature of scripting languages of the time, e.g.: Perl. I never read Perl being complained on for the same issue, which might well be, because it is a &quot;serious&quot; system language and because you might have to &quot;really&quot; learn it for any advanced use. (Even the boolean testing of int return types in Unix and C could be considered as some kind of premature type coercion.)<p>Late binding is probably most powerful feature of the language. (The language is built around it.) If it doesn&#x27;t go with your test suites, considering that both the language and the language the tests are built with are Turing complete, adapt the tests rather than the language.

This caused a slight DC bias within each sub band filter.

Essentially from Delphi to web development, passing by QT/C++ development and with some excursions to android and other things. Journey destination : got really, really, really tired of web development and ran to something without UIs (beyond cli).<p>Manually making sure your frontend/backend matches. I&#x27;ll repeat. Manually. Weakly typed. Constant bugs. Constantly seeing parts of your implementation getting deprecated, going unsupported, and of course not matching clients&#x27; &quot;hot new thing&quot; (WHY do you need a UI designer, which is a title given to every fuckwit that has ever started photoshop, successfully or -usually- not on an internal order management system ?). Impossible to generate tests that actually catch those bugs. Inconsistent language implementations, to say nothing of dom. Zero support for any kind of legacy thing. Layout engine inferior to what was available before I was born on machines that get their ass kicked by my watch (talking about the NeXT platform).<p>HTML/Javascripts idea of &quot;cross-platform&quot; does not mean even the fucking basic integer datatype is actually cross platform. HTML UI&#x27;s don&#x27;t reflow at all. There are UI engines that reflow pretty badly (VB). There are UI engines that reflow kinda bad (android/delphi, with delphi slightly better). There are UI engines that actually reflow (QT/GTK), I wouldn&#x27;t say they do it really well, but acceptably. Web is undoubtedly much worse than VB/Delphi in reflowing. Much worse.<p>Getting 4 buttons stuck to the lower right of the component currently on display, which will push out other things is in-fucking-possible. You see theses written, hundreds of pages, on -get this- getting 2 columns of text displaying side-by-side. Editing a string correctly, knowing it might contain non-latin characters, is impossible. Translating a webpage dynamically from one language to another, impossible (you can change it on the server, which of course means that any strings generated in javascript need a different solution -aargh-).<p>Getting a redraw loop going for a game is so ridiculously difficult and slow it&#x27;s painful to write about it. Give me a fucking canvas that calls me when it needs to draw itself, with OPTIONAL double-buffering. Doesn&#x27;t exist (no, HTML5 canvas is not this, is slow and resource hungry, and this will never change due to how it&#x27;s designed).<p>I was happy for 6 months with a small side-scroller implemented on a microcontroller that, together with the LCD, ran for about 6 months on an old CR2025 battery. This thing provides 225 mAh over it&#x27;s entire lifetime, keeping a game going for 6 months.<p>The state of the art HTML5 side scroller at <a href=""http://playbiolab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playbiolab.com/</a> drains my phone battery in 42 minutes flat. Granted, the music&#x27;s better. The screen size isn&#x27;t. That battery is a rechargeable 2300 mAh.<p>Getting anything remotely resembling productivity going on these platforms (I refuse to refer to web as a single platform) was so hard that I just gave up and ran the other way.

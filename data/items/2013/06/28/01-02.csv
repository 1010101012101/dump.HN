This is why, at least within the context of the EU, you cannot say Germany did this or Germany is in favour of that. When it comes to data retention German politicians dont have a uniform view. You cant even say that they are clearly opposed. Most probably want some kind of data retention (but its a complex issue that is passionately fought, so this is taking time).<p>On the EU level Germany was very much pushing for data retention and a big reason why it passed in the first place (while some other parts of Germany were very much against data retention and worked against it on the EU level).<p>Its wrong and misleading to talk about the EU abstractly  as is frequently done, especially in the media. If decisions are made on the national level all different opposing views are shown in detail and points of contention are discussed at length  but the EU apparently hands down laws like god on Mount Sinai. But thats very clearly not what happens.<p>The EU has many faults and is far from perfect, but one easy fix for many issues would be better and more thorough media coverage. To me this is also very much a failure of journalism. If no one portrays the conflicts and discussions in the decision making process then thats very bad. The decision making process has to be scrutinised and the people have to be given a chance to protest. But if the media is unable to do it that just wont happen.<p>Because the decision making process is on the EU level very much is long-winded and complicated, with dozens of different views on any given topic and many people who have a say. There would be lots to cover.",1372384066

I still don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m uninformed to suggest this is not a coincidence, despite you berating me.<p>I was chatting with my colleague at work today, who actually stood up our landsat servers and does all of our tiling work, and he thinks that the pixel-averaging technique to de-cloud the images was an innovation that was pretty unique to MapBox. According to this article, they noticed a guy doing it in February 2013, and hired him right away to do it for them: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/design/2013/05/a-cloudless-atlas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/design/2013/05/a-cloudless-atlas/</a>.<p>MapBox got to market with it in just a few months, and it&#x27;s a particularly absurd argument to say this was too hard for Google&#x27;s hundreds of maps engineers to implement. I heard at the State of the Map conference that it was just a few guys working on it at MapBox. Given Google already has the imagery, and the processing pipeline, I think adopting this declouding technique was actually a piece of cake.<p>Also, while Google has been removing clouds from their images for a long time, I think their technique has been to pick the best of many images. Their imagery used to have many more clouds in it, until all of a sudden.",1372383956

5955743,comment,5953756,5954590,1,0,mpyne,,,"> In practice it happens rarely, and if it does the police officers tend to be pretty friendly and reasonable. Case in point, one of the two or three times this has happend to me in my life, my ID was invalid as it had expired several months before. They were basically like &quot;Well you better get a new one soon, m&#x27;kay?&quot; and then sent me on my way. YMMV of course.<p>Well remember, when we discuss government programs the only valid point of discussion is what could possibly go wrong in the hands of a despot, not how the program is applied in practice. ;)<p>> The big difference though between the ID card thing and privacy violations by spying is that the spying happens behind people&#x27;s backs, and they may never know how broadly their rights are violated until one day the gathered information is used against them.<p>That has always been true in the U.S. though. Just look at the NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez, who was arrested on murder charges yesterday. During his arraignment the prosecution managed to produce a horrifying assortment of evidence against Hernandez, after only a week&#x27;s worth of police work (all fully legal and with proper oversight).<p>The only effective difference was that in this case the government did not retain the records by themselves, but subpoena&#x27;d them from the companies as needed.<p>The government could still theoretically switch to doing this too. PRISM is a good example, but there&#x27;s no technical reason why the NSA couldn&#x27;t just require the phone and Internet companies to store all the data that the NSA would anyways, and access it on demand.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that the things &quot;spying on us behind are backs&quot; are the things we&#x27;ve built onto the Internet.

I specifically disagree with this statement, assuming that Z == &quot;Snowden&#x27;s actions&quot; and X == &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;.  Snowden&#x27;s actions no more resemble Civil Disobedience than shooting a man or robbing a bank; all of these involve breaking a law, but only one of them involves breaking a law that the perpetrator believes to be unjust, in the hopes that their defiance will inspire people to strike down the law.<p>I don&#x27;t know what this jibber-jabber about &quot;indirect civil disobedience&quot; is.  I agree that a lot of people say Z looks a lot like X.  In fact, my entry into this thread consisted of saying &quot;Z does not look like X at all&quot;.  They are so different, in my mind that applying delta X is like saying &quot;imagine that instead of leaking documents and fleeing the country, he had not leaked documents, but instead sat at a segregated lunch counter, and instead of fleeing the country, he calmly complied with the police and spent the night in jail&quot;.<p>I agree with all of your points about Civil Disobedience itself; and you beat me to quoting King&#x27;s Birmingham Jail letter by the barest of fractions of hairs.  If you choose to, say, not pay taxes, and when the government gets wise, you skip town to avoid paying, this is not civil disobedience; even if you chose to not pay taxes to specifically protest the tax itself.

I&#x27;m typically only productive in collaborative groups, so I&#x27;m looking for coders interested in helping out. I haven&#x27;t decided on a language yet, but would feel most comfortable in python or javascript. Here&#x27;s the initial repo:<p>http://github.com/crawfordcomeaux/Poppins<p>Background: I&#x27;ve attempted to baby-step my way through addressing my different ADHD-related issues/habits (ie. &quot;executive functions&quot;) with and without the help of friends/family/coaches/counselors to no avail. After conducting a SWOT analysis of Crawford with friends/family, I took the list of weaknesses and drew lines from the issues that reinforce others (eg. disorganization reinforces perpetual tardiness). What I wound up with was two well-connected clusters of weaknesses and a few standalones. The disconnected issues were all related to personal interaction with others, which I&#x27;ve improved on over the years, and the clusters were all executive functions.<p>Hypothesis: Without an extremely strong support system, any attempts to tackle an executive function that&#x27;s supported by other issues are likely to fail. In the absence of a strong support system, clustered issues need to each be address concurrently while addressing the negative side effects that stem from trying to change multiple habits at once.<p>Additional Problem: I&#x27;m a tech-savvy coder without any self-discipline and a rebellious streak. I&#x27;ll rebel against things that get in my way, even if it&#x27;s for my own good, unless it&#x27;s just not worth the effort. How that translates to the project is that all components must be &quot;sufficiently&quot; protected from me (ie. takes longer than 3-5 mins for me to bypass the system).<p>Check out the GitHub repo for more information.",1372381589

367406,story,,,38,16,Eliezer,"Ask HN: Community software for Overcoming Bias?",,"The two main posters on the blog Overcoming Bias (which has appeared on HN many times) plan to cut back on posts in the near future.<p>One possibility under discussion is to split off/convert to a more community-oriented site - one that e.g. would let anyone submit their own articles or stories; the readers would vote up or vote down; and good posts would get promoted by editors to a front page.  E.g. Scoop has been suggested to us.<p>Dear Hacker News - over the last years, billions of dollars in venture capital have been spent on Web 2.0.  A rationalist community is surely a good cause.  What has that money built that can help us?<p>We're even willing to spend money - not enough money to develop code from scratch, but we aren't restricted to free products.<p>We don't want to throw sheep at each other.  We do want to have sensible discussions (which requires some kind of community policing such as downvoting).<p>We don't want people with lots of time to waste, to waste that time at our site.  We do want busy people to be able to check in, quickly see the newest comments, and check out again.<p>(Hacker News does great on e.g. downvoting trolls, making them nicely invisible, but still letting me drag-select to see the text.  But HN doesn't do so well on e.g. letting me see the latest comments on posts I've previously upvoted.)<p>We occasionally have meetups.  It'd be nice to know who else, or at least how many other rationalists, are within 10 miles of my zip code - that sort of thing.<p>But mostly I'll throw the question open - what has all that venture capital, and all the efforts of so many of you, built that will help us?<p>Please go ahead and say ""obvious"" things if no one else has said it yet, i.e., ""You should have a Facebook group (and use it for X, Y, and Z)"".  Think of it as if you were creating a standard reference list for new communities.  I don't know where to start, myself; and I'm sure this won't be the last time the question comes up.",1226958864

Different measures of profit help you figure out which bits to concentrate on, just like having a good profiler helps you pinpoint bottlenecks.<p>In this particular case, showing that a company can get to gross profit streaming purely by web is valuable info -- it shows that the hoops Joost is going through to do P2P distribution may not be necessary. It also chips away at the assumption that pipe-owners have a natural advantage. I did some work in this area, and I had thought Hulu would get murdered by their bandwidth costs.",1226958509
367402,comment,367391,367391,0,0,trickjarrett,,,"Sure you can sell it.<p>Options:<p>1) Online site markets, sitepoint.com and others have forums and tools that allow site owners to sell and either set their price or run an auction for the site. These are probably your best bet for a quick sale, though not for the highest ROI.<p>2) Maintain the site and let it run adsense to generate a trickle of side income. One new tutorial a week, or some sort of new content to help with SEO and user returns. The ROI on this sort of site is high, even if the total income is low, the time investment remains low.<p>3) Try to convert the site to include an editorial / blog to entice ad brokers. A much higher level of time investment with potential for the gains to increase as well.<p>3.a) To minimize your own time investment, pull a FHWW and look to hire virtual assistants to generate new content or content ideas. Will still require time editing and finding the freelancer / assistant, but can also reap benefits.<p>Best of luck!",1226958477
367401,comment,367277,367277,0,0,lethain,,,"This article buys into the idea that entrepreneurship is hard, and most people can't do it. Beyond being an exercise in self-love, this is the perspective that the 'big dumb companies' crave. Whether we say ""damn, I'm not good enough to leave"" or we say ""damn, I'm one of the few that is good enough to get out"", we're still buying into the vision that industrialists wrought for us a century ago.<p>Pre-industrialism, essentially everyone was self-employed (if we want a specific example, lets take the USA 150 years ago, rather than regressing into feudalism or Egyptian slaves); despite the posited inability of non-elites to be entrepreneurs. The barriers to entrepreneurship are not inherent flaws in the majority of humanity, but intentionally manufactured barriers to promote the industrial model of production and consumption.<p>Whenever you're cribbing euphemisms off of eight year old 50 Cents' songs, then you're probably driving the wrong way down a one way street.",1226958469

Entrepreneurs have the audacity to believe that the odds do not apply to them, because they know they are going to win.""<p>This sort of hubris has always bothered me about some entrepreneurial types. I understand ""looking past limitations"", ""going against the odds"", and ""taking risks"". But, I think:
a) There <i>are</i> outside forces which you cannot control and which can drastically affect your business (even to the point of failure). To ignore them is foolish, IMO. 
b) I think failure is a <i>key part</i> of being an entrepreneur. It's how you learn and grow. Failure happens sometimes.<p>Also, I wish his points on humility were a little more thorough (and included points on failure). I'm not sure W. Churchhill and John Lennon even qualify as entrepreneurs.",1226958446

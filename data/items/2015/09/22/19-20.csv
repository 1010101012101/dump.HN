It&#x27;s basically an entire book dedicated to the subject of misdiagnosis and how our modern medical system has some systematic flaws that contribute to it.  If I think about just how often I&#x27;m incorrect in trying to diagnose an electronics or software problem, and how little time an average doctor spends on a problem, it&#x27;s not surprising to me that anything that is remotely outside the norm could be easily misdiagnosed.  For me the takeaway is to just accept that for common problems doctors can do a great job, but if you have a condition that is not making progress despite seeing a doctor be open to the fact their diagnosis could be incorrect.  I had a minor problem with my ears a few months ago, went to a doctor, was given a diagnosis and treatment which temporarily improved the condition but did not seem to eliminate it.

This is probably overkill over a cheaper CRC.<p>Having been on the receiving end of entirely too many corrupted files in my life, I <i>strongly</i> approve of their use of a hash that&#x27;s been standardized and fast for decades and remains cryptographically strong.  &quot;But fast&quot; if you <i>fail to store it</i> isn&#x27;t very helpful.  TCP has a CRC too.  We&#x27;re wallpapering over it with better ones and everyone serious has been for years: it&#x27;s time to accept that cheap CRCs aren&#x27;t a good place to get stuck.<p>Improving the API to avoid the 2-pass problem is spot-on though.  Another possible solution is to require either a subsequent API call, or format the first message as a multipart, and use that route to have the caller submit the hash that&#x27;s used to confirm and commit the file to storage after the body upload.  This would solve the 2pass problem while still ensuring the client is actually doing the integrity check -- and since Backblaze is more than likely to take the heat on any corruption issues, it&#x27;s probably a good policy for them to make sure lazy client implementations aren&#x27;t going to cause problems that their storage then gets the publicity smear for.",1442951150

10261102,comment,10260174,10260174,0,0,VLM,,,"Its interesting that the article was entirely top down driven by statistics, and most of the discussion here is anecdotal.<p>Looking bottom up from a biochemistry point of view:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_metabolism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_metabolism</a><p>First there&#x27;s ethanol itself.  Enough in your bloodstream will quite effectively kill you.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  Its a poison and the liver will drop everything to save your life by converting it as fast as it can.  It has some tranquilizing effect on the brain which is the likely source of improved lifespan... lower psychological stress leads to lower blood pressure, lower adrenaline levels, etc.  Fun as it is to get high, that stuff is really bad for you.  On to the first hop.<p>The acetaldehyde conversion stage is a good strong kick in the liver.  Its clearly a net negative for the liver with no possible, no imaginable, redeeming characteristics.  Dosing the rest of your body with acetaldehyde is clearly not wise and its quite neurotoxic once theres enough.  Not as bad as ethanol, but poisonous, sure.   I am a little fuzzy on what causes more damage and kills people, the ethanol in the blood or the acetaldehyde output in both long and short run.  Its interesting that kids don&#x27;t express the correct proteins to clean up poisonous ethanol and its all fuzzy what is meant by &quot;adult&quot;.  Obviously fetus-grade young will be totally screwed up by ethanol and the immature liver&#x27;s attempt at cleaning it up.  At teen age, I donno, the normal adult response should have kicked in?  Tolerance should build as teens age, I think?  I think a kid that can feed itself and walk and all that is probably medically safe to drink in small amounts?<p>The oxidation to acetic acid isn&#x27;t too awful.  Hard on your Vit B and Vit C stockpile.  Acetic acid is great for making pickles, not that you&#x27;d want to pickle your internal organs.  Its none the less less toxic than the previous step (you see the path of ever lower toxicity...)  This is the step that&#x27;s wildly genetically variable across races in our species.  Most &quot;whites&quot; have the strong enzymes to devour acetaldehyde quite effectively, most asians not so much, they stew their innards in acetaldehyde, which will probably have some kind of statistical result in the top down studies.  Or maybe the lifespan effects of alcohol in the top down analysis have no racial component implying its nothing to do with the acetaldehyde pathway.  Acetaldehyde is specifically toxic to kidneys and I&#x27;ve never gotten a straight answer about alcohols legendary diuretic effect as self preservation or is it merely happy coincidence.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that if alcohol didn&#x27;t make you pee you&#x27;d have heavy abusers dying of kidney failure rather than liver.<p>Now we&#x27;re at the acetic acid stage.  Very few people die of pickle poisoning from eating too many dill pickles.  Then again soaking your blood in it for decades is likely not totally wise.  At this stage I&#x27;d call it &quot;mostly harmless&quot; and stop excessive worrying.<p>The next hop is to some funky intermediate that basically tosses acetyl carbons into the right place to join up with the big ole citric acid energy cycle later on.  Its more or less on the carb and fat metabolism pathway, nothing too far off the map as long as you don&#x27;t consume ridiculous quantities (like enough to make you fat beer belly).  Now we&#x27;re at the point where slamming a cup of soda or fruit juice or lard would be biochemically mostly indistinguishable from slamming booze.  Of course in the top down study maybe having the time and money to slam a fruit smoothie would have the same top down study long term results, I donno.<p>The final hop is the harmless-ish intermediate becomes part of the boring harmless normal citric acid cycle.  Thats boring and theres nothing &quot;interesting&quot; about alcohol once it hits this stage, other than maybe getting fat.  This is a rather normal and boring energy processing cycle.<p>Anyway thats the biochemical bottom up analysis to compare to the article.  So your brain chills, which might help with mental health and stress related cardiovascular stuff.  Its a hard kick in the liver best avoided if at all possible.  And later on its outright bad for your kidneys.  How this all balances up I donno.  Frankly if you want to chill your brain a little there are helpful little pills that&#x27;ll do the same thing without the giant kick in the liver or punch to the kidney.  Or inhale some nitrous oxide laughing gas or something.  From a bottom up analysis ethanol is not looking all that good, its basically a crappy poison.  If it were not socially popular, it would have a rep as being the shittiest illegal drug ever, right up there with drinking cough syrup to get high.",1442950753

Since this is a public forum, let&#x27;s just saw my revenge was a keen interest in the front counter, and the cash register.\nYes, I was finally making a good salary.

Guys of my generation(basically the 80&#x27;-90&#x27;s) would look for gravy, especially if treated horribly.  I wonder how that has affected the economy today?  Back in the day, if you had a gripe, and willing to take some real risk; you could get revenge.  (I saw other guys doing what I did--basically being horrid employees in the end, but they all went into this weird denial?  I guess it&#x27;s human nature to not admit someting like this?  (&quot;This&quot;--could be just cleaning the register keys.  They can get so sticky? And my ip is open sometimes, and I think my neighbor is a Reaver?)<p>Anyway, the last I heard, Dodger (the 45 year old jerk) was caught the second-third time trying to give flowers to high school girls, and he sold his store to someone.  The sale was unrelated to being a creep.  He would stand at their cars, dusted in flour, didn&#x27;t believe in bathing, with his bouquet of flowers.  He didn&#x27;t understand why the 16 year olds didn&#x27;t want to date him.<p>The only thing I miss was the fresh onion bagels, with 1/2&quot; fresh lox, creme cheese, and onions.  I would sneak out two and eat them in my chit box.  Thinking, &quot;I need to go to graduate school!&quot;, and &quot;Why does my head hurt?&quot;.

It&#x27;s possible to argue that loss is outweighed by the benefit everyone else in the world gets from having access to any kind of bagel at all, but it&#x27;s definitely a loss.<p>Second, it&#x27;s tied up with longstanding anxieties in the American Jewish community (anxieties that will be familiar to any immigrant minority) about assimilation. On one hand, if you are Jewish or love Jewish culture, it&#x27;s exciting to see something as central to that culture as the bagel exploding outside the Jewish community to the plates of the nation at large; when Jewish food becomes American food, it helps reinforce the idea that the days when Jews were seen as foreign or alien are over. But the flip side of that is that you can look at the bagel that&#x27;s landing on all those gentile plates and worry that maybe the price of becoming &quot;American&quot; involves having to give up the distinctiveness that makes Jewish culture Jewish. Is that too high a price for what it buys? How much of traditional Jewish culture can you give up before you&#x27;ve given up your Jewish identity altogether?<p>None of those anxieties are unique to Jews -- I imagine Americans of Hispanic extraction must feel the same way every time they see a Taco Bell. It&#x27;s a question that immigrants to America (and those descended from them) of all kinds have always had to grapple with: how do you embrace your new home without completely losing your connection to the old one? How much assimilation is too much?",1442949622

As people have pointed out, hardware has gotten faster and many user interfaces have gotten slower, so it seems more likely that: the target response times have been rising (people tolerate higher response times in exchange for more features or whatever), or people with older and slower computers observe much higher response times than the original target (iphone 3gs vs iphone 5 for a given app, for instance).<p>Stable hardware solves the second issue at least, but not sure about the first one.

For example, even if you gave me the biggest possible car, with some magic CO2-neutral power source and what not, I would still not like commuting.

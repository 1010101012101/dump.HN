I&#x27;ve actually been thinking about building a thrown-together site for just that purpose.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to get into <i>both</i> Rails and Django twice now (I&#x27;m a PHP guy usually), but every time I seem to get going, I get bogged down by StackOverflow after StackOverflow that have seemingly contradictory information or offer a third party solution rather than solving the problem within the framework.<p>In Rails, for example, Rails is easy enough, until you&#x27;re dealing with RVM * , Passenger * , and installing correct dev versions of database drivers.<p>In Django, you deal with South migrations when you want to update your database schemas, virtualenv * , virtualenvwrapper * ; in fact, I&#x27;ve heard that one of the criticisms of Django is that, in order to get to production quality, you essentially have to switch out every component of it with a third party.<p>* The starred apps don&#x27;t technically have anything to do with the framework; they&#x27;re more utilities for managing multiple framework instances. Still, you&#x27;re likely to find tutorials that use them as a de facto standard, which only adds to noob confusion.<p>I&#x27;ve started reading Michael Hartl&#x27;s Rails tutorial, which seems promising. I found that the highly-recommended &quot;Two Scoops of Django&quot; book was a little too narrative for me (just tell me what to do, dammit!); there&#x27;s definitely a need for more Django tutorials than just the Django website&#x27;s basic one -- kudos to the author for that.",1382450015

It&#x27;s built into the core of the company.  In the boom days, while Pets.com was betting on sock puppets and others were making ludicrous Super Bowl half-time ad buys, Amazon was building warehouses.  And they still are.  The seem to understand that infrastructure, over all other things, is what will let them win in the long run, no matter how unsexy it seems.<p>Their own logistics / delivery component would be a gargantuan undertaking, even for them.  They seem to understand what businesses they can get into and do very well in (cloud computing, generic branding (Amazon Basics), eBooks), and which ones to steer clear of.  I suppose they could launch this in urban areas, but that would be shortsighted in an area that they are particularly smart, so I wouldn&#x27;t count on anything past a pilot program.<p>Regarding what could be done to make more Amazons...  You can&#x27;t.  Walmart is the closest competitor (although they are a bigger company, but let&#x27;s see about that in 15 years).  If there is one company on Earth that can beat Amazon at efficiency (warehouses, shipping, and general business ops), it&#x27;s these guys.  They&#x27;ve made an empire around it.  But it seems their only strength here is their storefronts, so it seems like their online strategy would be to go the &quot;pick up in store&quot; route, which is a giant hassle for most.  So as Amazon finds ways to improve selection and reduce costs, Walmart will go the way of Borders, and a lot of other brick and mortar stores that came before it, albeit very very slowly.

AWS, for example, has a 50% gross profit margin, and their gross margins on digital goods (mp3s, ebooks) are also high. These aren&#x27;t small potatoes, these are multi-billion dollar businesses in their own right.<p>As for shipping, amazon already has a delivery service (amazon fresh) but I don&#x27;t think they have a strong desire to completely own delivery, they have very cozy relationships with all of the major shipping companies. If you knew how much money amazon actually pays for shipping you&#x27;d be astounded, they&#x27;re very good at using their volume as negotiating leverage.<p>Logistics is at the core of amazon&#x27;s business though, and it&#x27;s a big reason why they are succeeding where others are not. If you order through amazon you can expect most items to be en route in less than 24 hours. That takes a lot of work especially considering the sheer quantity of stuff they offer.<p>Aside from that, they aren&#x27;t just trying to do one thing, they are trying to diversify the company, so that it will rest on multiple multi-billion dollar divisions over the next decade (retail, AWS et al, ebooks, mp3/VOD, etc.)",1382449250

6591746,comment,6591186,6591594,5,0,leoedin,,,"I think the article puts forward one point - if the number of devices using DC is large enough, the load will become much less variable. Less variable loads mean one power supply can operate at peak efficiency rather than having many sitting idle most of the time.<p>I&#x27;m not completely convinced that this makes sense though. Any low voltage DC distribution network will need fairly thick wires to distribute anything but trivial power levels. The power lost in the cables over tens or hundreds of feet would probably make any efficiency gains fairly moot. The efficiency of modern switched mode power supplies is fairly high, and my understanding is that the no-load power use is almost trivial (milliamps).<p>One issue that seems to have surfaced recently is that there&#x27;s loads of very, very cheap AC-DC power supplies which are awfully made. It would definitely make sense for a single high quality supply over a bunch of cheap, noisy and dangerous ones, but I think the best solution is investing slightly in wall-socket based power supplies of a known quality.<p>As an aside, power transmission with DC is actually quite a lot more efficient than AC. The reason AC won the power race was the ease of voltage change with transformers. As solid state power electronics improves, we&#x27;re going to see more and more DC based transmission lines. We&#x27;re probably centuries away from a DC grid (if ever).",1382449063

First, if you make a minimum income of 1,000, anyone making less or around that will demand a raise, after all why would I work if I could get the same amount loafing around the house.  So the mid-lower tiers get a raise, and now the tier above that doesn&#x27;t want to make the same as the lower tier and they get a raise, so there is inflation as everyone suddenly as a lot more money to spend.<p>Which feels great for maybe a month or maybe a day, but with everyone making more money, goods in that area will rise in price, as landlords find they can make more money etc... and then we&#x27;re back in the same situation.  In theory goods outside of this economy with a floor would remain the same, but since the people that need to import it, store it, etc... would also be affected by the inflation in the end it doesn&#x27;t net anything.<p>TLDR; a basic income is an illusion, and inflation would quickly catch up.",1382449062

Depending on lighting, visual acuity, and the use of glasses, the DOF of the human eye can be startlingly small (less than a foot), or it can be very large (practically infinity).

Outside of software, <i>real</i> engineers have <i>real</i> liability when their systems fail [1]. PEs [2] are held accountable in most countries that license engineers when they sign off on things that should not have been signed off on. Too many people on the software side, even in safety critical systems, play fast and loose with the &quot;engineering&quot; aspect. We know how to design sound software, we know how to analyze it, we know how to test it. Deliberate, systematic approaches to these tasks can bring orders of magnitude greater confidence in the systems we produce, we just choose not to do it. Technically, in aerospace, we have DO-178C, which provides guidelines on artefacts that need to be produced, but too often these artefacts are created after the fact, rather than prior/concurrent to the development (where they belong). Criminal liability, career ruined by loss of licensure, these are risks that might actually temper some of the recklessness in the industry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse#Aftermath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse#...</a> - no criminal penalties, but civil penalties and lost their license to practice.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_eng...</a>",1382448259

6591622,comment,6590518,6590518,1,0,notacoward,,,"I was working on HA software in 1992.  Specifically, I was working on the software from which Linux-HA copied all of its terminology and basic architecture.  We ourselves were not the first, and often found ourselves copying things done even earlier at DEC, so I&#x27;m not complaining, but I want to make the point that this article from 2010 is actually a rehash of a much older conversation.  As cute as the metaphor is, it gets two things seriously wrong.<p>(1) Fencing and STONITH are not the same thing.  Fencing is shutting off access to a shared resource (e.g. a LUN on a disk array) from another possibly contending node.  STONITH is shutting down the possibly contending node itself.  They&#x27;re quite different in both implementation and operational significance.  Using the two terms as though they&#x27;re interchangeable only sows confusion.<p>(2) You only need STONITH if you have the aforementioned possibly contending nodes - in other words, only if the same resource can be provided by/through either node.  If the resources provided by each node are <i>known to be different</i>, as e.g. in any of the systems derived from Dynamo, then STONITH is not necessary.<p>To elaborate on that second point, the problem STONITH addresses is one of mutual exclusion.  It might not be safe for the resource to be available through two nodes, because it could lead to inconsistency or because they can&#x27;t both do a proper job of it simultaneously.  As in other contexts, mutual exclusion is a useful primitive but often not the optimal one to use.  <i>In general</i> it&#x27;s better to avoid it by avoiding the kinds of resource sharing that make it necessary.  That&#x27;s why &quot;shared nothing&quot; is the most common model for such systems designed in the last decade or more, and they don&#x27;t need STONITH unless they&#x27;ve screwed up by not fully distributing some component (such as a metadata server for a distributed filesystem).",1382448115

If you ask FTDI they&#x27;ll reserve a small block of PIDs for you to use for your own products that use the FTDI USB chips. 8 PIDs cut out of a 65536 block is not a significant cost.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that VTM still allows them to do it though, maybe it&#x27;s a special case because you&#x27;re using their IC.<p>The problem is that VTM maintains an &quot;official&quot; list of VID/PID owners, so that they can keep drivers on seperate IDs and prevent clashes for users. Most hobbyists just pick a random VID/PID for their personal projects and hope for the best, but for small scale hobby releases it&#x27;s problematic since &quot;technically&quot; they are going against the terms of service for the USB protocol.

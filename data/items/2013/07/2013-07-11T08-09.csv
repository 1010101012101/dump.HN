6025084,comment,6022001,6022950,1,0,jbert,,,"> For who, how often and when exactly? As far as I have understood, we are doing something wrong if we have to deal with debugging protocols which implement an abstraction, rather than just let the abstraction do it&#x27;s job.<p>Any time you&#x27;re debugging &quot;one layer above&quot; and you&#x27;re in Sherlock Holmes territory (i.e. the problem <i>seems</i> impossible, so one of your basic assumptions must be incorrect) you have to check stuff.<p>And if you check your protocol by using the protocol-parsing tool which comes with your protocol implementation, you&#x27;re not doing an independent test that it&#x27;s actually working OK.<p>As a more concrete example, I&#x27;m using a library doing AWS request/responses over HTTP. There are various places I could add instrumentation to dump information but:<p>- it takes work to add or enable. I can grab the on-the-wire protocol with strace or tcpdump (this a reason why it&#x27;s always good to provide a non-SSL option for your protocol)<p>- whatever is causing the problem could be below the layer I&#x27;m logging at<p>- they are all error prone. Maybe I miss a part of what goes on the wire. The data-on-the-wire <i>is</i> the only thing which matters for the protocol. The other end has no additional state.<p>When you&#x27;re debugging, you have to validate stuff. And look for patterns. Human-readable protocols facilitate both of those difficult activities, reducing friction.",1373533082

At the time the 6501/6502 was introduced MOS charged $20 per CPU while Motorola was charging $175 for 6801&#x27;s. Motorola dropped their price to $69 near instantly, but that was still a substantial percentage of the cost for a typical low end machine.<p>On a machine with more memory it might have mattered, but for a machine constrained to 64KB, the 6502 instruction set was easy enough to work with - it&#x27;s not like you could afford to use a large stack most of the time anyway, for example.",1373533051

Overwhelming force draws people (rightly so) into believing an injustice has been done.<p>What police <i>should</i> be doing is being rudimentary members of the community at large.  That is being just as vulnerable as the rest of us.<p>We have all seen the situation where a traffic cop gets killed by someone they stopped for speeding and has a warrant and kills the cop.<p>Then the state police go crazy and embark on a manhunt which can and has had collateral damage.  As if because that policeman died that a mob of local and state police can avenge the death of one of their own at any cost.<p>This is a sick psychological proposition, if police can unleash a vigilante hell against citizens when someone shoots or injures one of them, then why cant citizens do the same without repercussions? The police state is setting a very bad example for the rest of us.<p>If police were part of the community in the same sense of being vulnerable to the same bad forces the rest of us are, they would command a lot more respect and be seen as our protectors, but as it stands they have adopted the overwhelming force of stormtroopers.<p>As a result the respect they attempt to pursue from shooting dogs, breaking down doors, driving humvees, shutting down streets, invading homes with no-knock warrants, targeting people with no facts, will only erode their standing in our society while putting more people in jail unjustly, but also deny citizens from having any rights based on our national constitution.<p>And Washington will call it a debate.",1373532731

It therefore succeeds in living up to Penn and Teller&#x27;s goal. Also, again, they tell you exactly what you&#x27;re in for before you begin, so nobody can claim to be surprised.<p>A truly bad game involves false advertisement, where the seller (publisher, developer, whoever) falsely claims to have a good game when, in point of fact, they have a festering piece of dung. &quot;Pac Man&quot; for the Atari 2600 is an example: It claimed to be a version of the arcade Pac Man, but it&#x27;s a very bad copy at best, rushed out in an unfinished state to disappoint many, many people. &quot;Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing&quot; has already been mentioned; it shipped in an alpha state so broken the game is entirely unplayable. &quot;Superman: The New Adventures&quot; (&quot;Superman 64&quot;) for the Nintendo 64 is less obviously broken, being at least competently implemented, but the design it&#x27;s an implementation of is in no way an enjoyable game.<p>Anyway, those are a few examples of bad games.

Not data in transit.<p>Those agencies that have a more direct linkage to federal funding, for example, the ATO on the input side, and Social Security, for example, Jobcentres on the output side, are those bodies that probe metadata the most it would appear, under the provisions in the Act regarding defrauding the public finances without suspicion of criminality or otherwise, though such a suspicion is in itself also a justification.<p>While the funding provided to local councils via the states is also public funding, direct funding by the Commonwealth has as its aim efficiency of course, but also control and competitive negotiation between councils. The single representative present at the COAG meetings can only be partly effective at representation given the competition between the states. One size doesn&#x27;t fit all, and there is a case to be made for greater efficiencies by having direct negotiation with the Commonwealth, and for greater formalisation over things like standards of delivery and varieties of services.<p>With these advantages also comes responsibility, in things like reporting and budget control. Just as happens with the states that have an interest in maximising funding, and where effectively punitive financial penalties are extracted in future COGM rounds because of either malperformance or political difference, I contend that the pressure upon councils to protect their funding will only increase, as it has with the states, which face competitive constraints. Some will win and some will lose, but maintaining maximum levels is something that we expect in any case.<p>This is a significant constitutional change I think. Local councils, when directly accountable to the Commonwealth, and as providers of services financed from general Commonwealth revenue, will I think behave more broadly alike in their attitude to income and expenditure, and use the methods already allowed them, and already employed by certain other councils. The linkage between council revenues and the revenues considered exactly in the Telecommunications Act are more direct perceptually.<p>I think Australians should be cautious about this, and so do some of Australia&#x27;s politicians as well.

This is not just for publishing -- what makes it so interesting and fruitful is the way it can be used to structure many kinds of applications in the form of published resources...<p>&quot;Calling it a day and forking it&quot; seems in some way to mean giving up on this fruitful encounter between two paradigms. Then you get a binary socket protocol with no resource structure but with a lot of potential for shiny stuff, versus a document-centric protocol that&#x27;s slower and more restricted...

The ""downsides"" he lists are all excuses that suggest he's not really that committed and isn't willing to go ""all in"".<p>It's also important to understand that the 6% that goes to YC will be diluted by subsequent rounds of investment, and could easily end up as 1%-2% by the time they cash out.",1173927333

His point is that in order for a new idea or product to catch on, it first needs to be adopted by the ""innovators"" -- the ""geeks"".  Then, and only then, can it spread to the broader population.  If you try to skip the geeks and go straight to the mass market, you will fail.<p>I'm not sure I buy that as a hard and fast rule, but I think the concept is generally solid.  If a company makes it on TC, it will subsequently and consequently grow beyond TC.",1173927231

4297,comment,4281,4282,0,0,dfranke,,,"That math assumes that the only two options on the table are either accept funding from YC or don't accept funding at all.  The benefit you get from multiple investors is not orthogonal because you get diminishing returns from extra funding and because of the potential (for better or for worse) for interplay between investors.  So, if you have a different investor offering you different terms (or even the potential for such), as is more likely to be the case for a more established startup, then things get more complicated than that simple cost-benefit analysis.",1173926566

We'd love to try OpenID but it's complicated concept for many users. You can totally create a slideshow without giving us your email, today. If you give us your email we'll auto-post it to myspace so you don't have to<p>3. Look out for changes here<p>4. On the roadmap for the next couple of weeks<p>5. Yep<p>6. Agree, it's a question of how much time we had at that point. <p>thanks again!<p>/Gustaf",1173925934

54490,comment,54465,54488,0,0,vlad,,,"He doesn't sound angry at all.  I've read similar discussions.  Most foods in the supermarket are manufactured and flash-baked, not baked or picked.  This really works and you'll feel great.  Avoiding grains, milk, and corn syrup (found in sodas and juices, hot dogs, and other places you wouldn't think of) as well as all manufactured foods is exactly the best way to go.<p>The problem is, this can get much more expensive.  I'd love to be able to follow that for sustained periods of time.  On the other hand, everything you eat that's not manufactured gives much more energy throughout the day.  Who cares how much 'heat' a food generates in calories?  What matters is what kind of energy you get from it.",1189741132

The major problem with this diet (where 'diet' is what one eats on an average day, not necessarilly as a weight-loss tool) is you'll have so much energy, and your body will be so happy, you'll want to be physically active.  It will be very hard to stay on the computer.",1189741012

Do something creative with the design of the box and separate yourselves from the pack. The original Macs stood out because of their innovative look. Repeat that.<p>Steve Jobs got the authority and the designs are great.  That's why I've got an iPhone in my pocket and a MacBook Pro in front of me.",1189739316

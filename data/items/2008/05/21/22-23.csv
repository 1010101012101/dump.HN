196642,comment,196275,196620,0,0,mike_organon,,,"I look forward to having dynamic languages improving on the JVM.  When I moved from doing all of my work in Java to learning and doing mostly Lisp at work, I learned one of the biggest headaches of coding wasn't a lack of <i>static</i> typing (strong is not the issue), but NullPointerExceptions, which doesn't plague my Lisp code.  And for the defmethods where nil's might cause an error for not being handled, NULL is actually a <i>type</i> that I can code for to avoid the problem entirely.<p>Another thing I realized was how much code, or rather code-supporting files, where already in other languages around Java.  There's Ant, ejb-jar, properties, SQL, numerous internal and external XML, Javadoc, annotations, manifest, xslt, jsp, html, css, javascript.  Point 1: don't worry about Python, it's a better language than many of those you're already using with Java.  Point 2: with Lisp, it can be all Lisp, or you can integrate with other such languages where you need to.  I think the reason Java has all of these satellite languages (especially XML) and files is because the language is so weak and inflexible - Lisp is as flexible as XML, but works nicely as a programming language.",1211410140

All of our software is deployed, hackers are cracking away at code and everyone is happy.<p>We've got 4 hard drives going, 1 for production and testing, and the other is live.  The 3rd is for personal stuff, and the fourth is just sitting there doing nothing.<p>My co-founder suggested a rather interesting idea.  Offer small business email for local businesses, and use Google Apps for a front-end until we (either decide to or find another solution for) develop a front-end.  I think this is a great idea, the team agrees.  This may require upgrading our connection coming in to a T1 (running on a 10meg drop at the moment without a twitch).<p>This would be an expensive move, but if we get businesses on board that would be a very solid amount of passive income rolling in that we could put towards net profits.<p>Thoughts?",1211410045

With your original wording, it didn't make sense, since each roll would have the same prob, no matter how many times you rolled.  That's why I figured you meant that rolls weren't independent from each other.<p>But it seems that you mean, what's the chance that given x number of rolls, the very last one is a ""1"" (assuming you only need/want to get rich once).

Definitely Twitter more now for the small stuff, and my blog for the infrequent but more thoughtful posts.<p>So at the company I work at, we are in the midst of using a new CMS that was purchased within the last year. It sucks. We were using an old version of Vignette which definitely had its problems, and there was a well-defined need to switch to a new modern system.<p>So we've invested a LOT of money purchasing this proprietary system which, from my perspective as one of 2 front-end developers, is a steaming pile. It seems to work well on the engineering side as far as scalability, but beyond that its really horrible to develop for.<p>So my question is primarily this: I want to blog and/or twitter about my experiences with this. I feel like its a civic, moral duty to be able to share my feelings and warn other developers against making a bad purchasing decision.<p>However, a lot of my friends that I work with (including senior level people who made the purchasing decision) follow me on Twitter and read my blog.

What I discovered at Fog Creek was that they become super-efficient coding machines. The code looks pretty good, it's object-oriented and robust, but you don't waste time using tools that are at a level lower than you need. I've spent years writing code for C++/MFC and years writing code in Visual Basic, and let me tell you, VB is just much, much more productive. Michael and I had a good laugh today when we discovered somebody selling a beta crash-reporting product at $5000 for three months that Michael implemented in CityDesk in two days. (And we actually implemented a good part of ours in C++/ATL). And I also guarantee you that our Visual Basic code in CityDesk looks a lot better than most of the code you find written in macho languages like C++, because we're good programmers, and we write comments, and our variable names are well-chosen, and we do things the simple way, not the clever way, and so forth.""",1211407773

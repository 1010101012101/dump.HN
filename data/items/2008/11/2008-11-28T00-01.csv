379005,comment,378658,378658,0,0,davo11,,,"Doesn't this mean that<p>1) There exist mathematics (systems of logic) for which there is no way to reach logically from what we know now to how this system works, it must be intuited<p>2) But does this mean that reality is embedded in one of these mathematics? This is not necessary as far as I can see, so this still leaves the door open for a theory of everything in the physical world (string theory or some such).<p>3) But it does seem to imply that no infinite system can be described by a finite system ( a restatement of Godel ). So we can't set up a computer program to run the universe - no real surprise there.<p>or are the implications bigger?<p>from <a href=""http://plus.maths.org/issue37/features/omega/feat.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plus.maths.org/issue37/features/omega/feat.pdf</a><p>""To put it bluntly, if the incompleteness phenomenon discovered by Gödel in 1931 is really serious and I
believe that Turing's work and my own work suggest that incompleteness is much more serious than people
think then perhaps mathematics should be pursued somewhat more in the spirit of experimental science rather
than always demanding proofs for everything. Maybe, rather than attempting to prove results such as the
celebrated Riemann hypothesis, mathematicians should accept that they may not be provable and simply
accept them as an axiom""<p>So, for example, if we have the axioms of set theory, then for any theorem, it may not be possible to prove this theorem from the axioms as a set of linear deductions, somewhere along the line we may find a new theorem that requires to be stated as axiomatic, i.e.<p>we have axioms A,B
we have theorems C,D,E provable from A,B
then we find F which seems to be true, but we can't prove F from A,B, F must be stated as an axiom, probably not that surprising really.<p>Again just because systems like this exist, doesn't mean we live in one.",1227832240

379001,comment,378847,378847,0,0,netcan,,,"This is quite interesting.<p>On one hand, this article really gets it: 'above the line spending vs below the line spending; objective cost-of-sale vs speculative cost of branding.' From an investors' perspective, this will give you the picture. I agree with the conclusions. I think that online advertising largely because of google/adwords/google analytics, their competitors & the complex of supporting technologies & services, mean that the base chunk of online ad spending is much more robust then the average.<p>But on the other hand, the article seems to be written in the context & jargon of the advertising world that doesn't get it <i>""awareness, consideration, preference and loyalty""</i> is part of the consumer behaviour concepts behind traditional advertising selling 'ordinary products for ordinary people'- washing powder, toilet paper & cars. It's really squeezed in here. Then they mention hulu. That's dumb (IMO). Hulu is part of analog tv advertising. It replicates the analogue environment enough to be able to take their customers with them. I have no beef with this, but there is nothing the about.com, facebook or even (i think) youtube can really learn from them.<p>The second thing is that the undertone seems to assume that big traditional advertisers are the driving force behind everything. They were in tv-land where there is only room for a few dozen advertisers that needed to reach everyone & above all wanted to become 'your brand.' That has nothing to do with online advertising. The revolution is that advertising is now in chunks of whatever size you want. You can advertise a local auto repair shop on a $1000 a year budget with approximately the same ROI as a as a big name nationwide chain. That's the revolution. I'm sure coca-colas & Fords will eventually take a big piece of this, their big companies. But it's not their pie.",1227832060

You're basically saying they should commoditize their own hardware to the point where its at parity with Intel.  I'm saying they need to do the opposite - they need to increase (or at least maintain) their margins and focus on selling it to the people who really need it - enterprises and top end institutions that value the incredible robustness and scalability you can only get with that kind of hardware.  I think trying to do both ends of the spectrum on the same platform is just going to ensure they do neither effectively.",1227830678

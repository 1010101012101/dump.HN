I was a ""Vertical Manager"" responsible for managing labor, defining tasks, etc.  Here are 3 things that I learned:<p>Educate people.  Don't ""teach"" or ""instruct"" them.  Truly educate them on what you need done, why, and what you expect the results to be.  Education is a talent learned through experience.  Not everyone is good at it and more often then not a failure in labor can be explained in part by the quality of education distributed.<p>If … Then rewards often fail.  They can be demotivating and worst of all, people will naturally do the lowest amount of work or preform the lowest quality labor for the ""then"" reward.  Dan Pink author of Drive authored an exceptionally good book on the subject of reward and motivation.  You should read it.<p>Kindness, honesty and respect are conveyed in every action that one makes and if people know that you will treat them well, they will treat you well.  Motivation isn't some secret science and ""doing onto others"" is perhaps the most significant cornerstone of it.",1282501625
1624988,comment,1617205,1617205,0,0,CallMeV,,,"You become happy through a combination of factors.<p>First, resolving not to do anything beyond a level that you would recognise as ""hard work."" You set the bar on what level of work you would call ""hard"" and stick to that level.<p>Second, knowing when a certain amount of income is enough, and working to maintain that income level so people get used to you working at this level. If you keep putting in overtime to get more money, sooner or later the bosses will start thinking that they're underworking you and suddenly you'll be swamped.<p>Third, maintaining your ripcord. Put aside your ""fuck you"" money and save it. Add to your pot and forget about it unless and until you need it.<p>Fourth, making your work environment the place where you earn your money - not the arena in which your life is played out. Your colleagues are not your whole life. Work in the hours you have to, but live your life the rest of the time.<p>Fifth, don't bring work into your home life. Assert your right to bring your home life into your work. Let them see how unimportant work is to you.<p>Sixth, even if your home life and work life are tied up, everybody crowding you at home and at work, make certain that you have something to do that is entirely your own. Whatever it is, this is the thing you genuinely love. Share this with no one.<p>Seventh, become a polymath. Get interested in a whole bunch of things, not just your work. Imagine if you pick up mental arithmetic from reading of the Trachtenberg Method and start teaching it to your kids so they won't be afraid of maths. Now imagine picking up skill in a musical instrument, swimming, studying body language and learning Portuguese. All at once. Come on. It's fun.<p>Finally, the only way to be happy is to choose to be happy; to understand that you own your time, and to respond accordingly. Being happy comes first. Everything else is just gravy, because it's all something you will want to do.<p>Me, I'm broke, between jobs and under pressure to find one fast. And yeah. I'm ecstatically happy.

All of it: YouTube (when actually done for its intended purpose and not flagrant copyright flouting); facebook/myspace, foursquare, getglue. It's all about what you're doing and more recently _where_ you are when you're doing it. It's about the inherent need for self-fulfillment.<p>Let's say you have great taste in music. Just by someone noticing your daily playlist, you have an admirer. That admirer might want to know more about you based on that superficial quality, and follow you on your social update tool of choice. It's a tool of communication, much like a phone (actually more like a partyline, but I digress).<p>When it boils down to it, people need people, and as social creatures, we find every convenient avenue of acquiring and managing our social sphere as we can without expending too much energy. If we didn't care about any of that, hell, we wouldn't ever even comment in HN, right m0nty?",1282500128

And wouldn't that mean that the line would be in between those two rather than being longer?  Or is this referring to no <i>high school</i> diploma?<p>I'm also curious what the graph would look like if you included people who have Masters and PhDs.",1282500036

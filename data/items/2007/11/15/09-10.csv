Point shortened, logical reasoning requires no competition, hence logical inferences, which can be new knowledge, are not evolved. They are ""merely"" deduced.<p>I'm just attacking that one statement of yours and not discounting your criticism of the Montessori method. It is a worthwhile clarification though, because you are talking about ""serious theories of learning."" I have not thought much about it, but I do think there are merits, at least theoretically, to the Montessori method.",1195120448

BTW children's brain structure is fundamentally different from adults, the neurons literally are different - one concrete example of this is how children seem to learn languages effortlessly until they're about 8 or so; adults can never become as fluent.  japanese people literally cannot hear the difference between 'r' and 'l' - again, brain hardwiring is different.",1195118918

80110,comment,79898,80097,0,0,curi,,,"Where else does complexity/knowledge come from, besides evolution, then?<p>While it's possible some answer to that question will be invented in the future, it definitely doesn't exist now, and is not known to Montessori.<p>--<p>A computer finding a prime number isn't creating new knowledge. The knowledge about prime numbers was in the program. Following those <i>mechanical</i> instructions isn't a creative act. The chain doesn't go back further because the programmer created knowledge that wasn't a mechanical/simple transform from some previous chain link.",1195118304

80108,comment,79987,79987,0,0,SamanthaG,,,"Hi,I'm a uk based lawyer (also doing a start-up - looking for a co-founder), in the UK we have a free council run service for small start up businesses called ""Business Link"", is there anything similar in the US for you? If not, I think if you pick up the phone and call 3 or 4 law firms, explain that you're a small start up doing whatever and ask if they know anywhere/one that can help you for free at this stage. You should try and avoid paying legal fees just yet. If it were me, I would pick a very large, prestigious law firm, get some email details for attorneys in the corporate/business areas and email them and ask if they can recommend where you can look for some free guidance at this early stage. They are often quite helpful and like to assist if they can. Hope this helps.",1195117998

A few VCs shuffle you off to a Jr. Associate, which has some negatives, the biggest being that if you had any experience at all, you knew more about running a business than they did.  <p>If I was in PG shoes and I had to scale the business, I'd definately recommend getting some Sr. Operational folks with a like-mind to work very closely with the portfolio companies.

6765,comment,6668,6668,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I'm only partly covered by this list. It's true that I don't really have an immediately viable potential cofounder, but it's also true that if I had one, I still don't think I would start a startup in the near future. My main problem is that I'm most interested in machine learning and robotics, and neither of those seem particularly friendly to starting a startup. (Alexa doesn't run on robots, so I can't bypass the need for revenue, and selling robots to people other than the government has so far been a fairly limited market.) Grad school is much more friendly that way, and that's what I'm planning to do at the moment. <p>This may change in the next few years, but it doesn't seem like robotics will ever be as low-capital an operation as the Web.

6762,comment,6668,6668,0,0,mallipeddi,,,"Question to Paul: First of all I've to tell you I'm a big fan of all your essays. But a lot of things which you say in your essays seem to work really well only if you're developing Web 2.0 sites. Version 1 of any Web 2.0 app can be built with 3 people in 3 months with very less capital needs (especially if the founders are fresh grads, all you need to do is to feed them for the three months). So as an investor, I would assume that you don't have to care much about revenue models, business experience & age of the founders, etc because in the event the startup tumbles, you don't stand to lose a lot?<p>But what about bigger projects? Projects which need maybe 10 people working for an year? Hardware? Would your views change when you are asked to invest in projects of these kind? The reason I ask is because I'm a final year CS student in Singapore and I've developed a 360 degree video camera along with a couple of my friends and we've been talking to a lot of angel investors here. They all love the idea and are amazed by the demo but most of the time their major cause of concern is that we don't have business experience and we're very young (21). How would you evaluate an idea like this one (hardware+software)? Would you be interested in seeing something like this sent to YC? Or do you prefer sticking to web 2.0 sites?",1175045799

I'm not sure what the business model is, I wouldn't have called it ""stupid""<p>I imagine they put the IP warning up in response to the techcrunch press.  The real solution would be a message when someone picks up telling them to ""Press 1 to stop this service from calling you in the next hour.  Press 2 disable  it permanently""",1175045184

6757,comment,6668,6668,0,0,STOpandthink,,,"There will be more startups over time, but eventually this growth will hit a limit. There are only so many people who can participate in a startup. Eventually the startups grow and merge with big companies and that's where <i>most</i> of the people will spend their life working. Startup will always remain an adventure fit only for the elite.

After Startup School I talked to Adam D'Angelo about spam on facebook (largely because I'd never seen any); he said that there is a lot of spam activity, but that internal safeguards prevent most of it from ever being visible.  If the researchers were using internal, pre-filter datasets, their claim is reasonable.",1175044011

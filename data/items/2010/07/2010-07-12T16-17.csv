Back then, the web was a brand new world and I was having a lot of fun trying out new thing - as my first project, I created a fan site for the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip (Cool Calvin & Hobbes Collection - <a href=""http://www.nivmedia.com/calvin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nivmedia.com/calvin</a>).<p>After a few years, I moved state, degrees, jobs and stopped maintaining it. In 2005 I happened to check the web logs and noticed that it was still getting several hits a day. In a fit of nostalgia, I redesigned the whole site using the knowledge I had gained in the past decade (web design was always a hobby, not a job), and in the process added some Amazon links and some Google adverts.<p>I've barely touched the site since 2006, but it still consistently gets several hits every day and generates around $1-1.5k in Google ad revenue and $400 in Amazon revenue a year.<p>Nothing to retire on - but as the first site I ever created and for something I don't maintain, it still brings a smile to my face when the ad revenue arrives in my bank account :)",1278952563

It is worth optimizing this to be as pleasant as possible.<p>I can absolutely respect people who prefer the 'classic' old straight edge shaves, or the dollar store single blades, or the ultra-manly outback shave with a friggen knife..

In most states most private businesses can't prohibit concealed carry; in other states they can, but only with specific language on a certain size sign.  Plus, if you violate, it's just ""please leave"".  There are legal prohibitions against carry in certain places under state law (usually bars, schools, sometimes government buildings), and there are federal prohibitions at airports.  Not carrying when you're going to be drinking, or at a place like a club where people will be bumping up against you, is probably a good and prudent idea.<p>If it is concealed, no one should know.  Open carry IMO is a bad idea in a lot of places, and not something I would want to encourage.  <i>That</i> is what Starbucks seems to have a problem with.  Open carry is bad because it makes weapon retention a much bigger problem, plus it negates the ""no one knows who MIGHT be armed"" value of citizen concealed carry.

1508379,comment,1507887,1507887,0,0,10ren,,,"real competitive advantages:<p>(1). New technology that you have developed secretly and roadmapped into the future (so that as your previous release is copied, you are ready to release the next one). Of course, those developments must also be needed by customers (eg. enhance an attribute that they care about; meaning that the initial release was lacking in this aspect, yet it still had some core value that made it worth buying). It's a bit like having your own private giant upon whose shoulders to stand. Because you've done the experiments, you've seen more. You do more experiments, and see more again. This is keeping ahead of the engineering curve, and so it's a supply-side advantage.<p>(2). Customers that have developed a habit of using your product, especially if they have changed their behaviour in order to adopt it (they might have done so because you were the only one to offer the technology, and then being the one with the best technology - due to point 1). This is related to switching costs. Demand side.<p>(3). Related to point 2 is when you not just have customers, but you are recognized as the leader, because you have dominant market share (here's where it's an advantage to focus on a niche: it's easier to dominate a small pond that a big one). Psychologically, people like winners. It also means that you win all sorts of races, where people have to make a choice: third-parties choose to support you; big companies choose to standardize on you; users choose to train for your product. Demand side.<p>(4). Network effects! Again with the customers, but here, because of interaction between customers, the value of the product is proportional to the square of the number of customers. This makes it harder to stop you, but you first need to be ahead - so it's more of a multiplier than a CA in itself. Demand side.<p>(5). Feedback. Once you have customers, you get feedback from them, and you can improve. If you can get this feedback before your competitors (eg. by launching before them), it can help you keep ahead. It's a kind of secret information, as you learn about what the market really wants; and it's also specialized to your product. In these senses, it is proprietary (owned by you). Another private giant. Supply side.<p>(6). Revenue. Once you have money coming in, it's a kind of magic, because you can reinvest and grow. Smaller competitors can't match this (assuming you can spend the money in ways that make a difference - like advertising - but it can be surprisingly difficult to find such ways...) And even large companies don't want to bother competing with you, once you really get going (they might buy you though). Supply side.<p>(7). Although particular skills can help, there's always someone smarter, more experienced etc. However, I like to think that a particular combination of skills can approach a hard-to-replicate advantage (though of course it has to make a difference to the start up. It's no good being an art-expert + TCL programmer unless that's somehow needed).<p>(8). There are also milder ones like good PR (a kind of advertising), being attractive to talented workers (which in turn increase your success), being inspirational (more advertising).<p>I agree about patents. They're a good piece of paper as a bargaining  chip in acquisitions.<p>Now, the difficult thing for me is to apply these abstract ideas to my own actual startup (it's easier to be wise when you're not involved). They all seem to point to agility and getting your product out there <i>now</i>. Scary.",1278951343

Having the blog with online portfolio really helped - not to mention that I learned the technology side of web design from managing my blog.<p>When I was tired of CA, I moved to Chicago. I still love the Silicon Valley way of business though. Someone working at oDesk found me through a blog post around that time and then I started working with them as a client - remotely. They've been a great client, and having them didn't hurt in winning new clients.<p>I have the top hit on Google for ""lump in mouth."" The page gets about 25k hits a month, plus spun off into a forum, <a href=""http://lumpinmouth.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lumpinmouth.com</a> I make some okay ad revenue from that.<p>I also have one of the top hits for ""transfer itunes"" from a blog post I wrote about a method for transferring songs, ratings, playlists from one computer to another.

I have a straight razor that I love but I haven't used it in a while because (I assume) my honing technique is faulty.  I have been using the ones that use a disposable razor but it isn't the same.",1278950617

Sometimes more important than <i>how much</i> money you have is <i>what kind</i> of money it is.  There have been a few articles posted on HN about the different kinds of money.  I suspect that if you love your career and make little money doing it, you can be happier than you would with a high-paying career that you hate.<p>I'm sure that the basic trend would be the same, that happiness or life satisfaction would generally increase with wealth, but if you were to look at people who were happy with their careers, that plateau at $75,000 might vanish.",1278950537

You'll be able to filter out Irving's opinions and still see another perspective on the war. One in which Chamberlain and Halifax are statesmen who might have been successful in avoiding armed conflict, but for the determined war party of Churchill. I'm not here to make that case -- just saying, there are mighty few revisionist histories you can pick up at Borders, and you should read them.",1278950451

We were heading out to somewhere and, having an Android phone for work and seeing that her iPhone had a Google Maps application, figured that we could use her phone to help us get to our destination.<p>Imagine my surprise when not only did it not have turn by turn navigation, but it didn't recalculate the route when we made a wrong turn and were clearly driving off of the calculated path. I couldn't believe that such a feature was missing on the iPhone version of Google Maps.<p>Is there some reason that this is the case?

Tort reform is often not done because 90% (pulled from the air based on recollections of other vague memories of articles and statistics) of politicians are lawyers!

I recently launched my open source hardware startup, UPGRADE INDUSTRIES, and am looking for great projects to sponsor. If you have or know of a project run by students or dedicated hobbyists that needs to use a microcontroller board (mine is Arduino compatible out of the box), let me know!<p>Just drop me a line (kevin@upgradeindustries.com) with your project idea and why you think my product is the right tool for the job and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.<p>Here's some info about BoardX:<p><i>What is BoardX?</i>
BoardX is a collection of electronic circuit boards that stack on top of one another to share resources, communicate, and extend the functionality of one another. This system is built on the BoardX Motherboard that acts as both an electrical and structural foundation.<p><i>What is the difference between BoardX and other boards like Arduino?</i>
Unlike similar products (but much like a familiar PC system), the motherboard does not come with a processor pre-installed. Processors come as simple, low cost add-on boards, which allow any processor (or multiple processors) to be used with the system. If you buy the AVR-X Add-on, you can have a powerful Arduino system that is fully compatible with the Arduino SDK out of the box, no modification required. In addition to that, if you pick up the XBee-X Radio Add-on and follow the instructions, you can use the Arduino environment to program BoardX wirelessly!<p>You can check out my work at: http://www.upgradeindustries.com",1336747895

You should also divert money towards long-term, non-tax-advantage funds.

If you accept that you will never beat the market (which in all likelihood you won't, especially if you don't have time to research stocks), you should never purchase individual stocks as a means to make money.<p>Now, I purchase a few individual stocks on the side, but this is my equivalent to gambling or buying lottery tickets.

The latter is more financially devastating but the first is more terrifying to be on the receiving end of and could result in you dying or being crippled.<p>Further, I didn't really have in mind some guy doing a hold up.

3959232,comment,3957899,3957899,2,0,k4st,,,"One of the reasons I like C++ is that it lets you throw away type safety and still maintain it through abstraction. This sounds awful, so let me explain.<p>In one project, I implemented an EDSL for performing a destructuring bind on a string (CFG production, actually). The types of the components of the pattern determined what the pattern would actually match.<p>This was all done in a previous version of C++, so I didn't have variadic templates available. I also didn't want to heap allocate the internals of patterns.<p>What I did was to store an array of void pointers and a function pointer as private fields within a pattern class. When constructing the pattern, pointers to the things to which parts of the string to be bound were put into the array, thus throwing away their types. BUT, the function pointer pointed to a static method in of a class template, which only operated on the array of void pointers in a type-safe way, precisely because it was compiled with the knowledge of the types.<p>I use this type of subversion when appropriate, and it's often a very convenient solution to an otherwise tricky problem. Such a thing would either not be possible--or be incredibly inconvenient--in C. It's often very useful to treat different stuff uniformly, knowing that your abstractions can maintain type safety.",1336745397

Like any measure it picks up some signal and a lot of noise, e.g. bullshitting skills. The trick is to combine measures such that the noise largely cancels out while preserving the signal.<p>If this were the only type of interview question used the points you brought up would be a legitimate concern. Given that it was, in my case, married in a much greater proportion with concrete questions I maintain that it generated unique, useful information.<p>Traders generally have, prior to entering a trade, the opportunity to think through everything thoroughly and ask for help on the bumps. There are also times when the cost of the time for analysis is so great that a gut, if rough, call is needed, e.g. holding hard drive manufacturer equity as news of Bangkok flooding breaks. Being able to ball-park figures, after issuing a disclaimer about the uncertainty of one's estimates, is also a generally useful analytic skill.<p>It should also be noted that part of recognising the priority of things to be analysed is the degree by which they deviate from expectations - generating many of those expectations is a form of intuitive estimation.<p>But, as I said, it's mostly to estimate whether this is a person we'd like to spend 10-16 hours a day near.

3959209,comment,3957230,3957230,1,0,kennu,,,"I can share Puppet's two greatest weaknesses from my point of view (managing an AWS infrastructure of a few dozen servers):<p>- It handles dynamic host environments like AWS badly. Puppet's SSL infrastructure gets often confused when hostnames and IP addresses of servers change and you can't disable certificate checking completely, even if you don't need it. As a result, Puppet sometimes dies and can't continue until you manually resolve the certificate issue (usually by deleting the client certificate and letting it regenerate). This can be helped by using fixed certificate names, but I've still seen these problems occur and they shouldn't.<p>- The dependency based configuration model gets very hard to manage when you keep adding new features to servers over time. Unless you reinstall the server from scratch every now and then to test it, you're bound to make subtle mistakes in the dependencies. This will bite you the next time the server is being fully reinstalled (e.g. after EC2 instance termination), as Puppet needs to run multiple times to satisfy the dependencies and this will take hours (because it runs in 30 minute intervals).<p>Because of these problems, I've been considering switching to Chef for a while but haven't gotten around to it yet.",1336745109

I close site very often few seconds after it's loaded because I don't want to read such ugly stuff. I'm delighted if site looks well. I guess it's because design tools evolve and we must wait a bit before good readability becomes standard. You know, few years ago we were happy if there was any text on website at all. Maybe one day MS Word documents are going to look like LaTeX ones. I hope so.<p>Thanks very much for those ""read later"" stuff. I think I might find them useful.

There are ~11.5 million Catalan speakers in the world, and most of them in Spain. While the majority of Catalan speakers can also speak Spanish, they are extremely defensive of their language and you will find most road signs, governmental correspondence and general communication in Catalan as well as Spanish.<p>Most Ad networks will shoe-horn these users into Spanish ads. I imagine some Catalonians find that practice offensive. When you compare the number of Norwegian speakers in the world (~5 million), it puts things into perspective.<p>In actual fact these ad networks are missing a pretty big slice of the market when you add everything up. In Europe there are huge migrations of different nationalities. In a very short time the numbers of Greeks who leave Greece for other European countries will start to sky rocket.

The best-seeming one I've heard of is YippieMove -- http://www.yippiemove.com/<p>Has anyone here used YippieMove to either migrate from Gmail to Gmail, or from Gmail to self-hosted email? Does it do what it says on the tin? What about security? It's bad enough that Google has access to all of my messages -- I'd prefer that random employees of another company not read them, too.

They have an incomplete feedback loop, and are isolated from the repercussions of their decisions. This at first makes a non-coding architect useless and then makes him actively wrong. This is especially true in systems as complex as enterprise systems.<p>Because code is design and because building the design is free (in comparison to building a bridge), you need to actually translate your mental design into the real blueprint--the code. If you are isolated from that, then it's like sketching blueprints. You may be consistently wrong on some aspect of it, but you'll never know.<p>If skyscrapers could be built and torn down overnight, I bet you money architects would build the skyscrapers without the same rigor of blueprints, look at the result and say ""Nah, move this a foot over!"" and build again.<p>The correct equivalent for building construction workers is the <i>compiler</i>.",1341603849

Power will be your primary issue, and to a lesser degree, internet. When we ran a lot of servers on UPSs, the UPSs start to become a major pain. UPSs fail much more often than hard-drives. And when the battery dies it cuts off power to the computer. You're using low-end desktop machines, so you probably don't have dual PSUs in each machine (if you did you could run each PSU to a different UPS). UPSs are also much more likely to fail when the grid power fails. So the power goes out, your UPSs will kick in, then 30 seconds later one or TWO fail. Can your power distribution can handle that? I'm no UPS expert, but this seemed pretty common across a variety of UPS products.<p>As for internet, multiple links is a good start. Load-balancing outbound traffic is fairly straight-forward. Inbound traffic is much harder. Really you need BGP. A BGP-based set of links isn't cheap, and doing the configuration yourself is hard if you don't have experience with it. The alternatives that aren't IP routing based are usually based on DNS, which is better than nothing. But the effectiveness of it is dependent on how your users servers/clients/browsers implement DNS caching. It will work OK for some users but some will cache the stale link IP for 24 hours -- not cool.<p>You certainly can work this way, and probably get three nines of uptime. But I can say now that we switched to a decent colo I sleep a lot better. We can focus more on building product, adding value for our customers, than screwing around with the utilities.<p>FWIW I'm basing this off of my experience in the United States.",1341603161

Grossing this up by 365 days equals 12,750,000 nights projected for 2012 (5M / (143/365) = 12.8M).<p>This calculation implicitly assumes that the rate of bookings does not increase for the rest of 2012, which is probably not true looking at their impressive growth rate.  The author backs out a 19% month-over-month historical growth rate using other statistics published in the same infographic.  Using this rate of growth, he derives a projected 17.6M nights for 2012 versus the 12.75M above.<p>> with the length of each reservation increasing substantially from the year before<p>The 17.6M projected nights makes no explicit assumption about the ""length of each reservation.""  The 5 million nights published by AirBnB could have been 1 user booking a 5 million night stay (it wasn't) or 5 million users booking 1 night stays.  It doesn't matter, the length of reservation is embedded in the statistics and not separately dealt with, so the author cannot be growing that assumption.<p>> the post is assuming maximum commission on each reservation<p>He does not use the maximum commission on each reservation, which we established would be 15%.  Instead, he uses 13%.<p>> Payments collected on behalf of other parties (i.e., the payment fee) are not treated as revenue under GAAP.<p>I'm not going to argue GAAP accounting, but from a <i>cash</i> perspective, AirBnB is collecting 9 to 15% on each reservation.  If a listing is for $100, the Guest pays somewhere between $106 and $112 per night (i.e., 6 to 12% markup) and the Host gets $97 ($100 less $3 or 3%).

Designer frames (Gucci, Nike, Kate Spade, Prodesign) retail around $120-$240. (I think? I'm going from memory here...) Lens pricing varies based on your prescription and options (transitions, AR, scratch coat, etc). Single vision wearers can easily get designer glasses w/ integrated anti-reflective for under $300 retail. At my optician that includes a 2 year warranty. Also my insurance knocks that down quite a bit. Since Warby only does single vision lenses, $300 would have been a more appropriate ballpark than $500. Lens price can jump up quite a bit if your prescription requires certain materials (e.g. high-index lenses) and it jumps up a lot when you get into progressives, etc.<p>Also, I can't remember ever purchasing glasses and not having them adjusted to my face when they arrive. I guess you can take your Warby glasses into your regular optometrist and have them adjusted but that feels a little like taking your Burger King cup to get free refills at McDonalds.<p><i>you're going to be choosing from the same frames as any person who lives in your area.</i><p>This is so much of a non issue that it is kind of weird to even mention it.<p><i>This is a market where sales channels are fragmented and undifferentiated. The product being sold is either the equivalent of the ""CVS store brand"" or has the prices inflated two-fold.</i><p>I assume he's talking about optical chains here? (Lens Crafters, etc.) Anyone want to guess what Warby's materials markup is? Cost x 2 seems like a reasonable guess.<p><i>Brick-and-mortar stores are expensive to maintain, inevitably adding a lot to the price of every product, but bring little value to the customer, except the ability to try on glasses.</i><p>I guess he's referring to optical centers that <i>only</i> sell glasses? I don't recommend going to those places, either.<p>Anyways... Warby looks good for people with simple prescriptions who don't have insurance. Really, it is just cheaper designer knock-off frames and low to medium grade lenses with really good customer service. A good business model, yes. Earth-shattering value and disruption? No. Most people will continue to buy at their doc's office.",1341601802

I'm guessing the jpeg spec has some variable length space in some kind of file header that the html for the page can be put in to.<p>I read something similar a while back (I think it was called a Jafar attack) where a clever person worked out how to create a file that was both a valid .gif image and .jar java executable.",1341601403

4209162,comment,4209052,4209121,1,0,justinschuh,,,"Web browsers need to be very loose in how they interpret data for historical reasons. A lot of this is even codified in the current HTML standard, like always content-sniffing images and identifying data that can be ignored during parsing. You also have HTML comments, which is where most of the JPEG data is packed in this example. Combine that with the fact that image formats generally allow you to pack comments or other arbitrary metadata into fields, and you end up with a file that can be read as either a JPEG or HTML. Also, Michal has a weird thing for squirrels.",1341601355

I can work around the disadvantages using standard techniques.  The result is code that is easily FFI'able from any language, quicker to compile, has a smaller footprint, sane error messages, easily debuggable in gdb, etc.<p>Also, there are some advantages in the abstractions that C encourages you to use. For example, lack of templates pushed C programmers to discover intrusive data structures, and those are better in many ways than templated containers ala STL.<p>Another example: ""virtual"" methods may fail to override a base class method if you make a typo - resulting in potentially cryptic bugs. Using a simple macro in C:<p><pre><code>  #define MAKE_VTABLE(prefix)  { prefix##foo, prefix##bar }\n</code></pre>\nI can make vtables that are safer than C++, and require no more boilerplate than C++ code.  The compiler will guarantee that I implement all of the required vtable methods.<p>If I want to get speed via multi-core rather than pure uniprocessor speed, why use C++? I can use Haskell and get much easier and safer parallelism with many other advantages.",1326703802

I really can't see what everybody else think they are seeing, a crow having fun sliding down the slopes on his newly invented snowboard. I see a crow trying to open the great-smelling lid of a jar to get to the food ""inside"", having chosen a really lousy location for this activity. The crow is stupid for trying to open an object that is not a container, and stupid for choosing the ridge of a roof to do this. And above all, it is visibly frustrated with the results of it's own stupidity. It's not having fun, it's hungry as hell and can't get to the food it thinks is inside the lid.<p>UPDATE just to clarify what I'm saying: I'm not questioning the intelligence of crows, I'm questioning the interpretation of this video. There could be crows playing chess and appearing on radio talk shows and I would still argue that this bird is just trying to find food and being stupid in it's choices doing so.<p>He's mostly standing on the lid picking at it, which is exactly how crows eat.

NOT TROLLING, but can I ask why anyone would want to learn C, other than to develop device drivers, kernel modules or other arcane software that is yet to be replaced by C++?<p>I asked this question of a younger programmer the other day, because it seemed to me, that to HIM, learning C was a rite of passage, and that he was less of a man for not knowing it.<p>I find macho philosophies in software development both amusing and counter-productive.(If you really want to be macho, become a lisp hacker). My amusement may be personal, but the counter-productivity of using C, when better abstractions (i.e. programming languages) already exist, is real. It creates fiefdoms and priesthoods that are counter-evolutionary and hard to maintain, and leads the death of much software.<p>Personally, I would rather std::string be pored over by many eyeballs and evolved than change strcpy to _strcpy or strlcpy. Unless I am working for NASA on an embedded device for a satellite, I would rather Moore's law or SMP or DSMP give me the speed I need, than give up productivity to squeeze every last CPU cycle. Developer time is a lot more expensive than hardware (except on satellites and space stations).<p>Apologies if it is your ambition to work for NASA on embedded devices in space stations, I just think you may as well learn C++. You get most of C, plus some really useful and productive abstractions as well.<p>If you want speed, learn inter-process communication and the principles of symmetric multi processing. With C++, you also get to abstract away the problems of strcpy and strlen, replace Byzantine function references with class methods, and 35 parameter functions with polymorphism.\nBest of all, most of the programming world will still think you are manly if you know C++, so you get that too.",1326703301

Of course, this doesn't mean their results were incorrect, just that they weren't entirely conclusive.<p>Ultimately you wouldn't expect violinists to be able to tell the difference between old and new, just good and bad. It would be astonishing if every single old violin was better than every single new one. So other than the fact that price may not always corrolate with quality (what else is new, this happens in any market, from computers to cars to clothes), I'm not sure if it means that much.<p>There's actually an old story I love, that afaik isn't true. A concert violinist got so tired of people constantly praising his stradivarius rather than him for his performances that one day he played an entire concert with a fake, a copy of his strad. The audience of course had no idea, and went mad for him at the end, then he put the violin on the floor and jumped up and down on it, before giving a speech about his point.",1326702721

If you're passing random input (without any error checking) to pretty much <i>any</i> of the built-in functions, You're Doing Something Wrong.<p>Whether you call strcpy/copy <i>buggy</i> or <i>unsafe</i> doesn't really matter. The implementation on all platforms pretty much follows the standard, with its well-known issues. Sometimes it's the right tool for the job; sometimes not.<p>It's also important to remember that strcpy_s doesn't just magically solve all your problems. Someone might think that this code is safe:<p><pre><code>    strcpy_s(src, 10, dst)\n</code></pre>\nBut if dst is shorter than 10, you'll have a problem.<p>Going from ASCIIZ to length-encoded strings isn't something you can just do in the middle of a function; it requires changes all over the place. K&R was written with ASCIIZ and low-level programming in mind. There's nothing inheritly <i>wrong</i> about this; it has both its advantages and disadvantages. Your book is written with length-encoded strings in mind. (Which I think is the best way to teach today).<p>I love the concept of this chapter, and I pretty much agree with you in your critisms to strcpy/copy, but suddenly you go from ""this code has issues"" to ""this code is bad, bad, bad; never use this code; only silly people would write this code"" and so on (at least that how I feel when I'm reading it). I think you should place more emphasis on ""this code was written to only work with certain input; look how bad it performs under fuzz-testing; see how easy we can fix it!"".",1326701904

Quite frankly, I'd reject any such notions, since there is no such general feeling, at least none that I've ever heard, so <i>that's</i> not what's keeping people from walking through the nursing school door in the first place (otherwise, I figure I would have been at least cognizant of such a general perception).<p>Similarly, I'm skeptical whether tech really has any significant misogynist reputation once we look beyond feminist-in-tech bloggers and male me-too hangers-on - none of the women I know seem to have that impression (though granted, they're from pretty varied and non tech-centric backgrounds), and I certainly have not seen where I've worked.<p>When I <i>have</i> asked my female friends about their impressions of the computer world, they tend to think that yeah, it's a circle-jerk of forever-alone dorks, but they generally assume that they'd be <i>more</i> welcoming to women and more accepting of them than guys in most fields, not less.

There might be some implied sexism, and perhaps occasionally overt sexism, but it's nothing like what you see on other parts of the Internet.  I've seldom read a top-rated comment on HN and thought, ""wow, that's really sexist.""  Sure, they exist at the bottom of the page, but there isn't much we can do about that.<p>Do you have a discussion in mind that makes you feel that way?

3469816,comment,3469440,3469730,5,0,jon2512chua,,,"I would say that there are 2 kinds of ""work"" involved in wedding photography:<p>1. The physical stuff like scouting out the locations way before the day of the actual wedding, attending wedding rehearsals to understand how the actual ceremony would go like on the day itself, the actual shooting for the wedding ceremony as well as the reception, and the days after spent sorting through the shots and editing them.\nThis is definitely a lot more physically taxing compared what a recreational photographer (which I'm assuming the author is) is normally used to. I still remember how my legs just gave up after I came home from spending the whole day running around trying to get all the shots while lugging around a couple of kgs of gears.<p>2. The mental stuff like how stressful it is to know that you only have one chance to get things right on your client's special day, and if let's say you screw up the bride-walking-down-the-aisle shot, you can't just get the couple to rewind the whole ceremony just so you can get the shot right. On top of that, sometimes if you're unlucky enough you may even face lawsuits from dissatisfied couple asking for a refund AND for you to compensate for their wedding costs and pay for a new ceremony so that they can have those ""memories"" be immortalised in photos. Don't forget that like in all creative professions, you have to deal with clients who insist that you charge too much cause their 16 year old nephew with a DSLR can do the job for free.<p>So yeah, wedding photography may be for some people but personally I wouldn't want to make a living out of it, probably because I don't think it suits my more laid back personality.",1326700810

Thus, it's not entirely surprising that at least one fast follower would dominate the leader.<p>Secondly, the failure rate calculations are highly suspect due to historical redactionism. If a first mover fails, it will still be remembered due to it's contribution to the field. If a fast follower fails, it becomes hard to even discover that it existed in the first place.<p>Think of this in terms of car companies. Ford was the first mover but, up until the 1920's, there were almost a thousand different car companies started by various people: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_United_States_automobile_manufacturers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_United_States_a...</a> . 99% of them failed, some had moderate success and a few like Toyota & GM had enough outsized success to eventually beat Ford.

And the more money he makes, the more value he's delivering.</i><p>I agree that people should receive reward in proportion to the value they create, but I don't believe that people who make more money are always delivering more value.  The main problem with that idea is the difficulty in determining how much value a single individual actually generates.<p>There are plenty of terrible CEOs who destroy the value of the companies they manage, yet still receive huge salaries and bonus packages, and there are plenty of great teachers/engineers/others lower on the totem pole who earn a relative pittance.  Is this because of the value they've created, or due to the CEO's direct proximity to value creation, an ability to convince others of their importance, and a relatively small supply side?  I'd say looking at the ridiculous increases in the CEO-worker earning gap over the last few decades it has been warped by factors other than deservedness.<p>It may be true that there is a correlation between value created and income, but I think there are too many other factors at play to say that it is a general rule.",1286215109

1756563,comment,1755713,1755713,0,0,tptacek,,,"There are two very good reasons why nobody should bother doing this.<p>First: browser Javascript is the most hostile possible environment in which to implement cryptography. From actual experience: you are better off trying to implement crypto in a microcontroller, with kilobyte-denominated space for code storage, no cold-start entropy, and a few tens of bytes headroom for negotiation. Seriously: do that first, before trying (and inevitably failing) to run the Javascript gauntlet[1].<p>Second: the security economics of mail drastically favor Google over anything you come up with, even if you're really good. That's because the cost of a sitewide compromise at Google is stratospheric. Google is maximally incented to protect their service and has the resources and mindshare to do so. Nobody cares about someone else's bespoke mail service. People who care about mail security but don't trust Google just VPN to a private mail server.<p>Incidentally, Fortune 500 companies grappled with this problem many moons ago, and have adopted the strategy of ""things that need to be sent over secure email will instead send links to an HTTPS web application we run onsite and call 'secure email' even though it's really just 'private file sharing'"". Which makes it doubly hard to pitch this as a product idea: most of your market has already rejected the model you're considering.<p>This is a bad startup idea. Avoid it.<p><i>[1] For starters: in browser JS, every function call can be redefined arbitrarily many times before it gets key material, web content is allowed to influence or even rewrite that code, there's no effective way to verify code before running it, code is pulled from multiple sites, there are browser ""chrome""-level security flaws still being discovered, there's no solid secure random number generation, functions are timeable, there are solid implementations of only a very few algorithms, and what remains to be implement is hazard-prone. Writing crypto code in JS is hubris, pure and simple.</i>",1286214854

When there is a bug found, write the test first before you fix the bug. This way, at one point of the life of the software, you'll eventually have enough tests to cover. I think most people put too much focus on the development story rather than the maintenance story thus most people only explain how to do TDD on new code, not how to do TDD on existing code (or rather, the next phase).<p>I've been in projects where because the people behind them were not putting too much effort for testing, they start automation effort from behind. Eventually you'll hit a chicken-n-egg situation: we'd like to refactor this buggy part but the architecture makes it hard to write automation test.<p>All professional projects will have automation tests at some point of their life. People by now should already know that software grows and hiring more QAs, re-test everything (regression, smoke, full-blown, etc), or even telling devs to test the code they just wrote manually don't scale.<p>Keep in mind that sometime, quality is defined by the client (or by the requirements).

It doesn't cripple you socially as it once did. Knowing what material your water pipes are made of has become much more important, now that we're aware of the crippling effects of lead. The present world is greatly influenced by the manipulation of amounts of mass and energy too small to see. We've come to accept this situation without surprise, and we tend to think about emergent information content and not mechanics or chemistry.<p>To a typical Victorian all of that wouldn't be heresy so much as fantastic nonsense.",1286212175

I even wrote Robert Glass to buy hard copies of his detailed defense of it 5 years ago so I could learn more about what made it great. In certain critical ways COBOL was better than what came later.

1756394,comment,1755713,1755713,0,0,david_shaw,,,"It's hard to implement securely.<p>Think about this: if encryption/decryption is performed client-side (JavaScript), then any cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) could potentially leak sensitive information to an attacker. (Where are private keys stored? How can Javascript prevent client-side attacks from leaking keys/passphrases?)<p>That said, client-side <i>hashing</i> and sending of passphrases is not a new concept. This HN post (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1750468"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1750468</a>) from a few days ago goes over some of the intricacies and possible security implications of client-side hashing.<p>As far as actual client-side crypto (meaning the algorithm itself): Javascript is simply too prone to tampering. The problem is that, let's say the user is phished or man-in-the-middled. They will then implement (edited and flawed) crypto that will appear to them to be genuine, while in fact their passphrase and ciphertext were probably just leaked all over the Russian hacker underground.<p>Now, I'm not saying that it's impossible to implement client-side crypto or even that those that do will immediately get hacked... I just think this is why someone hasn't really provided it as a service yet.<p>Oh, and one more thing--if it's client-side encrypted email, how does the plaintext get from the email server to the client? Over the web in plaintext or HTTPS?",1286212106

1756392,comment,1754154,1756162,0,0,kls,,,"The tech market in general is experiencing a depression of technical talent. Three things caused this issue:<p>#1 was the .com bust it drove a lot of talented people out of the market as well as most of the ""gold rushers"" (aka people who learned flash in a week and where commanding 90k for crap). A good deal of those people moved on to other careers in other fields. Probably in the area of 40% of my associates of that era are now in business or pure science related fields.<p>#2 Again .com bust but this time educational. The university tech programs experienced the same issue. The money went and so the students that where in it for the money jumped off the ship. I was going back to school at this time and it was literally 1 day full class, next day, me and two other guys in the class.<p>#3 ""we'll outsource it all"" did not work. Companies terminated entire development teams to move them off shore only to have to bring them back after the fact. Each time you do this, it is the breaking point for some of the individuals who decide that this one is the last one and leave the industry.<p>So yes, if you think you are underpaid then you are underpaid especial for ""typical web developer"" which is one of the hottest fields in tech. This industry has the peculiar way of chewing people up and spitting them out. If you go by the numbers chances are you wont last in it. You need to charge a rate that reflects that reality. The funny part is once you do your resilience in putting up with the grind becomes higher. I have lasted a long time in this industry and I can tell you there where two times that I tried to get out. It can and will burn you out, it is just a matter of whether or not you can survive the burnouts without leaving the industry. A fare wage for the work has a lot to do with being able to survive it until it passes.",1286211976

It's dumb and pointless, and is really just defensive nationalistic kneejerking.<p>Another common argument I hear from the Chinese is the ""you had our turn, so we get to have ours"".

Compare the following - ""Hi, we're New York Pizza, and we want you to be satiated. You should eat good food."" to... ""Man, you ever get hungry and you're not sure exactly what would hit the spot? We're New York Pizza - we make good pizza, at a good price, 24 hours, that always hits the spot.""<p>I'd kill the word ""social network"" from your pitch - people roll their eyes when they hear ""another social network"" - there's got to be ten million would-be social networks online now. Pitch yourself as the first, and only ""..."" that's completely unavailable on the market. Don't try to carve into someone's ""social network space"" - I'm at my friend's house right now. He has Facebook and Myspace and checks both of them. He has a dead Friendster account. He won't use another social network... but he DOES use Evite, because that scratches a different itch.<p>Something like - ""It's easy to get lost online, and miss out what really matters - like eating good meals with good people. I founded Sponty because I remember back when it was simple and easy to get pizza with your friends, and you'd get together with people you cared about to watch a favorite TV show now and then. We're drowning in info with Myspace, Facebook, Friendster, and a million other tech things that keep us apart from our friends and zombies in front of the screen. Sponty makes it easy to meet up and hang out with your friends, and do what really matters in life. Join as at Sponty and get back to the days of great times, with great people, with no hassle. It's easy to join - all you need is a Google account - and you'll be using Sponty like a pro within 10 minutes. Just don't feel too bad that you'll be away from Facebook doing cool things!""",1234497365

I wouldn't play Mob Wars either, but that hasn't stopped it from being a success.<p>- I'm not in USA.<p>- My friends are really reluctant to start using new services. It took ages for them to start using Facebook.<p>- My friends probably do not have Google accounts. In fact they would probably be more likely to use this if this was a Facebook app.<p>- As you say everyone needs to eat, so it is safe to assume that each of my friends will have dinner anyway. So if I want to have dinner with a particular friend, can't I just SMS them? I think they would find this more natural than me trying to talk them into signing up for something.",1234497273

I would try to to make the page vertically a bit more compact, so the entire ""Login using Google"" is above the fold. I have a relatively large monitor, and yet only the top of ""Login using Google"" shows on my screen.<p>Then I'd test some descriptive instruction above ""Login using Google"" to explain why they should - the value to them. ""Take a test drive and see how your social life improves - all you need is a Google account to get closer to your friends"" - something like that, just make it shorter. Test different variations that answer the question, ""why should I go to the next step?"" It might seem obvious to you, but you're intimately familiar with your site. Me, why should I log in? The site looks nice, but what's the value here? What's the learning curve? Will this be a pain in the ass to get running?

You don't need to register anything - the (R) in a circle means Registered Trademark, and you need to register that.<p>Kellogg's has a registered trademark, they paid the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office), and had a search done to make sure it didn't infringe on anyone. They have a very strong legal standing if anyone comes after them:<p><a href=""http://www2.kelloggs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.kelloggs.com/</a><p>But look at Google - they just use (TM)!<p><a href=""https://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com</a><p>TM adds a bit of credibility.

In any competitive field with a quantifiable scoreboard, you could take the data, extract from it means and standard deviations, and say with x% certainty that one player is better than another.<p>In money management, x is never very large. It's so small that you can't reliably say that anyone is better than anyone else, in fact the overall distribution of money managers isn't much different from what it would be if it were all chimpanzees selecting stocks with darts.

I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds interesting.<p>VIM is definitely top dog. I remember how excited I was when I learned how to use "":vsplit"" and "":e ."" -- I spent the next few years using it as my IDE.

479379,comment,478807,479251,0,0,geebee,,,"Unfortunately, looks like my comment lost the first half somehow... anywhere, here's what I meant to put first...<p>First, thanks for addressing this in a reasoned way.  The issue gets emotional sometimes.<p>That said, I disagree with your arguments.<p>A recent study of the H1B visa showed that the majority of these visas go to Indian outsourcing firms, not American companies looking for top talent.  I have no doubt that many talented people come to the US on this visa, and that these people are well paid, but that appears to be less common.  Most of the H1Bs are awared to rank and file workers, so I think much more displacement than innovation is going on here.  I also think that we could easily create a visa (with full mobility rather than indentured servitude) that we could award in smaller numbers to higly talented foreign nationals.<p>I strongly object to your use of Sergey Brin as an example of why the H1B is important.  Keep in mind that the writer of this article had no problem with engineers and scientists immigrating to America, he was just opposed to a specialized visa created specifically to increase the number of engineers.  An engineer who immigrates independently of the visa program (as is the case with Sergey Brin, who grew up in the US and chose to study CS once he was here) would argue for the latter - that we <i>don't</i> need a specialized visa to get these kinds of people here!<p>(... then continue with the rest of the post, thanks)",1234495839

It might be more accurate to say that they view us as horrible useless burdens who need to be ushered back to full-time work as swiftly as possible. They will do anything in their power to keep employees from exercising their federally guaranteed rights to twelve weeks of MOTHERFUCKING UNPAID LEAVE, up to and including forcing employees to give up paid sick leave.</i><p>Wow. She is a hero for writing this.<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s terrifying, and it&#x27;s why our society is doomed to fail in the next 30 years if it keeps acting up this way: we <i>need</i> people like her to reproduce, and we&#x27;re punishing them when they do.<p>Extreme economic inequality, a bad health insurance system, an expensive education mess that puts a huge burden on parents, declining social mobility, and a corporate structure that punishes childbirth and the raising of children (especially for women) have had an anti-eugenic effect. The thoughtless, ignorant people who live in the present are having lots of children-- just as many as ever. The thoughtful, well-educated ones are having fewer kids, because they&#x27;re more attuned to the cues of society and the obvious signal that they&#x27;re not wanted by this world. We&#x27;re seeing an adverse differential in reproduction.<p>If something kills the U.S., it&#x27;s not going to be China or the EU and it&#x27;s certainly not going to be immigration, which is a good thing. It&#x27;s going to be the adverse reproductive differential caused by a society that penalizes intelligent, thoughtful parents.

8533698,comment,8533633,8533633,0,0,tokenadult,,,"In reply, I say bravo for trying to become a better writer. And if English is not your native language, don&#x27;t become discouraged too soon if your progress seems slow at first. I&#x27;ve been very impressed by the English writing here of some people who plainly grew up speaking some other language in a non-English-speaking country. Keep practicing, and you will become better.<p>For specific writing advice, I recommend the new book <i>The Sense of Style</i>[1] by Steven Pinker, which is about not just fussy rules of English but also about THINKING in a way that helps improve writing. I will have to practice with the ideas in that book for a long time.<p>For specific advice on improving English, I have some tips I&#x27;ve shared before here on Hacker News that other readers have liked. As I learned Mandarin Chinese up to the level that I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution. For ANY pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou, the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.<p><a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>But a speaker of one language who is past the age of puberty will simply not perceive many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the target language (the language to be learned) without very careful training, as disregard of those distinctions below the level of conscious attention is part of having the sound system of the speaker&#x27;s native language fully in mind. Attention to target language phonemes has to be developed through pains-taking practice.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. For example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than * &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>Most software materials for learning foreign languages could be much improved simply by including a complete chart of the sound system of the target language (in the dialect form being taught in the software materials) with explicit description of sounds in the terminology of articulatory phonetics<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>with full use of notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet.<p><a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>Good language-learning materials always include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the target language, and no software program for language learning should be without those. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner&#x27;s pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That is not an easy problem.<p>After phonology, another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task on which most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.<p>The classic software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. Words don&#x27;t match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. The map is not the territory, and every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The royal road to learning vocabulary in a target language is massive exposure to actual texts (dialogs, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, etc.) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. I&#x27;ll quote a master language teacher here, the late John DeFrancis. A few years ago, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I&#x27;m especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars/dp/0415150329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a><p>and it is well worth your while to study books like that both about your native language(s) and about any language you are studying. Good luck.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stevenpinker.com/publications/sense-style-thinking-persons-guide-writing-21st-century"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevenpinker.com/publications/sense-style-thinking-pe...</a>",1414684557

What the LGBT community wants is acceptance that it is a acceptable form of sexual expression.<p>I definitely feel like there is some amount of &quot;pushing homosexuality on everyone&quot; that has been going on the past five or ten years.  It&#x27;s no longer socially acceptable to think that homosexuality is wrong or an unhealthy sexual expression.  Even donating to an anti-homosexuality lobby can get you pressured to resign [1].

I have some impressive professional achievements as an engineer, and I also am a graduate of a top CS program. I recently did a set of onsite interviews at least competently: It&#x27;s hard to judge how they saw it but I definitely didn&#x27;t bomb out. In the end, I got rejected. I guess the reality of my excellence as an engineer doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is that I didn&#x27;t appear like an algo-puzzle genius that day in front of a whiteboard. Based on this and other experiences, I conclude that:<p>1. The whole &quot;developer shortage&quot; talk from top companies is self-inflicted at best. I know it can be hard to find the right hire, but the top tech companies have loads of solid applicants and turn away great people every day. If they were truly desperate, there are so many great people they could snap up.<p>2. Making the interviews entirely about algorithmic questions biases towards new graduates and academics. To be honest, working as an engineer does not develop the &quot;algo&quot; part of my brain much. They might as well challenge me to a chess match to &quot;prove my intelligence&quot;. (I don&#x27;t play chess)<p>Personally I&#x27;d rather see interviews focus more on real things related to professional practice, at least for experienced hires. If they really are interested in testing my ability on the spot, would it be so hard to set up a computer and have me perform tasks that developers actually do?

As for the software development side of things, you&#x27;re pretty much limited to a subset of win32 that isn&#x27;t very pleasant to use or a mobile CLR which is so incredibly slow it makes you want to hang yourselves. Then there&#x27;s the incredible deathly pain of deploying the code to all those devices.<p>It took us three years to deliver a point of delivery system with the same staffing level with much smaller scope which was simply signing for stuff and listing a delivery schedule. The integration was done by a third party - we just passed messages back and forth.<p>They did a damn good job at TW on this one if you ask me.",1414681983

We don&#x27;t have to search the entire universe to find Christian god absent, we just have to look at the evidence put forward by Christians to be inadequate. You presumably don&#x27;t believe in Zeus or Thor, or Mythras or Isis or Horus or any of the other gods that died with the civilizations that created them, and this is presumably because you find the evidence for these inadequate.<p>> On another note, the argument that you know the method therefore the agency doesn&#x27;t exist has always seemed illogical to me. I know how Toyota puts its cars together, that doesn&#x27;t mean that Toyota doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>This is because people have used gods in the past as necessities needed for explanation of natural phenomena. Of course these explanations are not such thing at all, because you now have an ever bigger problem, by positing an intelligent being you are making bigger assumption than the phenomena you are trying to explain and now have a larger problem to solve, possibly leading to infinite regresses. All the above paragraph is saying is we don&#x27;t need the hypothesis of deistic god ether. The evidence against theistic gods is much stronger though, and the idea can be dismissed completely.<p>Let me put it this way. You speak of god, but did you invent the concept, or did you hear about it from someone else? And if you heard about it from someone else, what evidence did they show you that convinced you with absolute certainty that there had to be such a thing.",1414681979

I said ""When does the winner get picked?"" and they said ""Every Friday, someone comes by to get the cards, they pick the winner over the weekend. So on Friday I went over at 5:30 and waited for the cards to be picked up. In comes a well dressed lady with another jar, same labelling, drops it off and picks up the one with cards. I intercept her on the way out, and ask what she is doing with the cards.<p>As it turns out, she was the receptionist for a recruiter in the valley, they took all of the business cards, added these people to the list of people who they told their clients were 'looking for jobs' and then tried to move them from one job to another.

A few things:<p>- The idea of ""personal shoppers"" being a growth area seems dubious. With recommendation and predictive desire systems getting better all the time, I think this is probably a no-go.<p>- Nannies might be a growth area for a few decades, but decent AI will likely obviate the need for these as well. I'd give this one 50-50 odds over the next 4-6 decades.<p>- Basically everyone on that panel endorsed the guaranteed income. The fact that people from so many different perspectives had their policy prescription converge to that is really striking.<p>- This also brings us back to the ""how do we occupy the unemployed masses?"" question yet again. Arts and leisure activities will likely not need much support from society, as they will just happen. Sports might (stadiums, etc.) Other things we'll probably be looking at will be extremely powerful, long-lasting, side-effect-free (or tolerable side effect having) drugs. That road of course leads to wireheading, but I think that denying that as a possibility now is extremely naive.<p>A cultural shift will be required, as several people in the video make clear. Having one's self worth (and respect of one's peers/society) be defined by a traditional support-one's-livelihood ""job"" is going to have to disappear. Demonization of those ""lazy parasites and slackers"" is just not going to work in a future where much human labor is not needed.<p>Another thing this brings to mind is the effect on the labor market for those still in it (programmers, robot designers that cannot themselves be replaced with robots, etc.): a great deal less unemployment, at least for a long while. For those skills that are essentially not able to be automated any time soon (let's stay over, the next 50-100 years) those that stay in the labor market will not be doing much competing for open positions. It may in fact be an employee's market in those cases where someone is not simply their own business.<p>Other good articles on the topic:<p><a href=""http://buzzmachine.com/2011/08/05/the-jobless-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buzzmachine.com/2011/08/05/the-jobless-future/</a><p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/why-workers-are-losing-the-war-against-machines/247278/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/why-work...</a><p>(referenced in the NYT article)<p>Edit:<p>If you haven't read Autor's work (""The Growth of Low Skill Service Jobs and the Polarization of the U.S. Labor Market

If you train yourself to control your mental state you can suffer all sorts of physical afflictions but psychologically you can still be as happy as ever.<p>I used to think that balance was the key, but after some consideration I'm undecided.  If spending all your energy on training yourself to be happy actually makes you happy despite your physical well-being, why would you need balance?",1243339015

Absolutely unbelievable.<p>I immediately canceled my account and never used PayPal again.",1243338914

(Skype did fine under eBay management, although I'm sure not to its full potential, as illustrated by recent events)<p>However, the eBay horror stories of people getting screwed over and the various facilities supposed to protect them failing miserably usually include PayPal in some way. PayPal has become known as the payment processor used on eBay, and not much else, and with eBay's reputation these days, that's not a good thing.<p>In fairness, the PayPal arm of the company seems to be just as much to blame for eBay's reputation as a scam haven as the rest of eBay.<p>It's kind of funny, PayPal was a buyout that had obvious strategic benefits for eBay's core business and has ended up as a disaster for PayPal.

The guy paid for it with Paypal. Sent off the motherboard. The guy refused delivery, and then accused me of not sending it.<p>Being a nice guy, as he actually didn't receive the motherboard, I refunded the guy his money.<p>Then he filed a complaint with Paypal for me not sending the motherboard. Paypal would not listen to my side of the story at all, even though I had proof of shipping and proof of his refusal of delivery.<p>So then Paypal gives him the money (from my account) for the cost of the motherboard. So the guy walks away with my $200, and Paypal doesn't care, and does nothing, and actively seems to want this to be the outcome. This wasn't bad customer service. This was company policy.<p>There's a reason this site exists, and why I tell everyone to never, ever use Paypal if they can help it:<p><a href=""http://www.paypalsucks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paypalsucks.com/</a>",1243338165
626551,comment,626126,626126,0,0,rjprins,,,"I've studied industrial design for a few years, here is what I can tell you:<p>Plastics is a very large subject and there are a lot of criteria that can be involved. You criteria apparantly are:<p><pre><code>  - Can be made in small series. (ie. no injection molding or extrusion)
  - Holds electrical circuitry.
  - Serves mainly the purpose of container. 
  (no exceptional stresses, no special features, 
  must be able to open and close in some way.)
  - Consumer product, so must have somewhat nice finish.
  - Should be tappable for screws?
  - Production accuracy within 1-2 millimeters?
  - Can be made in your own workshop?
</code></pre>
Here are some small-series techniques you could look into:<p><pre><code>  - (Resin) casting
  - Dip molding/casting
  - Heat molding
  - Spin casting
  - Vacuum forming
  - Hand laminating or spraying
</code></pre>
I don't know what materials are exactly applicable to what technique, but for your purpose some common materials are:
PP, PS, Styrene-butadiene, ABS (especially), PA6, Polyester (resin).<p>Goodluck!",1243338153

They lock accounts without reason and don't offer much support as to why.<p>* Transferring money from your bank to your PayPal account takes a long time. Even longer if you are not from the US.<p>* Many people have credit cards. Why add another middleman?<p>Less personal but relevant issues:<p>* PayPal makes you spend money that you HAVE. A credit card doesn't.<p>* Branding. Not everyone trusts companies with their credit card, why would they trust a company that has very little do with the process over one who is actually vending the item/service.",1243337693

626537,comment,626281,626503,0,0,geoka,,,"I use conkeror--which is a vimperator ""clone"" based on xulrunner, with emacs-like keybindings and commands.<p>""Is it problematic when a site has graphics for navigation?""<p>It depends. Most of the time it's still a link, so the browser has no problem identifying and highlighting it as such. If it's something fancy (image map? JS magic?)--it can be a problem. Fortunately, such sites are not common.<p>""Do you cycle through links and then choose the one you wanted, or is there a more direct way of accessing them?""<p>You press 'f' (for ""follow"") and a number appears next to each link. Then you enter a number to follow a link.<p>""Is it really faster than using a mouse?""<p>It depends. For example, there are whole WM environments which are designed to work without mouse (ratpoison, stumpwm, xmonad, etc.). Naturally, a keyboard-driven browser lends itself beautifully to such environments.  Other than that, I find it annoying having to move my hand from the keyboard each time I need to look something up with a browser.<p>Of course, when I just surf the web, the mouse is usually more convenient.<p>""Do you need two hands to be efficient, and if so, wouldn't you rather be efficient with only one hand, for example using Opera's mouse gestures?""<p>Since conkeror is modeled after emacs, I'd say yes (unless you happen to be using a custom keyboard layout or something). As for the efficiency--again, it probably depends on the ""mode"" I am in (mouse is easier for plain surfing).",1243337238

Note how ""unsolicited"" is right there in both of them.<p><i>The number one sales technique of shaking hands and smilling is equal to sending a friendly cold email.</i><p>The difference between ""shaking hands and smiling"" and what you are describing is that shaking hands and smiling is something you do one-to-one. Buying a list and blasting email to it is not. It's not personal, it's not individual. It's more like using a dialer to blast faxes to fax machines than any one-on-one salesmanship.<p>And more importantly, you're not allowing people to opt out. There are a range of body language indicators and other social cues that people can use to tell you your smile and handshake are not wanted. Someone who happens to end up on a list you bought has no such recourse.<p><i>hold on. I'm not finished. Say I sent them a monthly newsletter of things they can do to improve the quality of life for their disabled children. Right on the middle of the newsletter is an advertisement for my app. Am I spamming then?</i><p>Yes. Yes you are. Ethical marketers build their list via opt-in mechanisms. Your mechanism is the opposite: you assume everyone on your purchased list wants your messages, and force them to opt out if they do not. In other words, you are <i>creating work</i> for the people on your list who don't want your messages. Which means that for those folks, not only are you not adding value to their lives, <i>you are subtracting value</i> by creating a new problem they have to deal with where none existed before.<p><i>Marketing, believe or not, is what puts your food on your table. Not your precious code... You would not even be a programmer if some marketing guy had not managed to successfully market computers...</i><p>In my experience, the people who shout most loudly about their sterling ethics and critical importance are usually the least ethical and least important.

I do believe that at some point people will need new forms of energy since the forms we currently have are too expensive (or getting to expensive) for the average person to afford. Since the market needs the majority of people (in the popular cases) to need their energy, maybe it will adapt. I would like to see some more competition in the market of energy; in most small cities in the midwest and some of the larger ones there are virtual monopolies allowed by the cities.

5004579,comment,5004423,5004532,62,0,jules,,,"Temperature is not really the average kinetic energy any more. The temperature of a system says something about how much the entropy increases as you add energy. Negative temperature simply means that the entropy decreases as you add energy.<p>This is possible if the number of high energy states is small, because then adding energy will result in the system being in one of a smaller number of high energy states, thus having lower entropy (the entropy of a system is basically the logarithm of the number of states we think the system could be in, so if the number of states is lower, then the entropy is lower). Another way of saying this is that is as follows. For positive temperatures our knowledge of the state of the system would <i>decrease</i> if we added energy (think about a box full of neatly arranged balls and giving it a kick). For negative temperatures our knowledge of the system would <i>increase</i> if we added energy. In the extreme case if the number of possible high energy states is 1, then adding energy can force the system into exactly that state, thus we would know all you can know about the system.<p>In particular in the experiment described in the article, if you removed energy from the system the particles would not be in the lattice arrangement and instead would go around randomly. Thus the entropy would increase if you removed energy.",1357246263

Basically, I wanted to deliver whatever the prospect asked with video, files, images, etc.  I hated boiling everything down to a 5 paragraph email with 4 attachments.<p>Over the past few years, I noticed a trend towards 1 page websites - they were easier to create and easier to consume.  As I explored this 'micro publishing' concept, I started to see new sites appear like <a href=""http://Pen.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Pen.io</a>, <a href=""http://OneSheet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://OneSheet.com</a>, etc<p>Even in the past year, consumer driven sites like <a href=""http://CheckThis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://CheckThis.com</a>, <a href=""http://Smore.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Smore.com</a>, and <a href=""http://Tackk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Tackk.com</a> have emerged thus underscoring this trend towards tight one page publishing.<p>I've called this pages POPs for a long time (Published One Pager or Public/Private One Pager).  The idea, for me at least, is that if you could empower people to create POPs that looked nice & allowed you to easily share/track... perhaps they could alter how we communicate online.<p>Since we've launched our alpha, we've seen over 40+ ways users are communicating with POPs - well beyond sales.<p>So, thoughts?<p>Here are some inspirations we've made based on what the alpha group has uncovered.<p><a href=""http://inspiration.populr.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inspiration.populr.me</a><p>Cheers,<p>NLH<p><i></i> Questions are welcome.

There almost needs to be some mechanism to hold funds while leveraging them for defense, in the similar way to a bail bond. As far as rich mobsters, having prosecutors resorting to vague statutes of unrelated crimes (wire fraud instead of murder) is indicative of a larger issue with the criminal justice system (as well as many other scenarios in comments here.)

This means avoiding things like gradients, or unnecessary colors can have a major impact on file size. It's also the 'art of design' to manage to create a beautiful design without a lot of crappy and needless 'veneer'.<p>I don't know the specifics of the PNG algorithm, but it can do an amazing job at compressing an image if it's made up of few and often repeating colors (typically it's terrible at photographs, however).<p>When you apply a scaling algorithm (as exemplified by the post) other than nearest neighbor, it tends to create a lot of intermediary colors that end up hurting the size of the image.<p>Looking closely at the borders of those buttons, that blur is going to end up adding to the file size because it adds colors that didn't exist before. If you properly 'scale' (which sometimes requires a redraw at a smaller size to get it right), it can have a huge impact (sometimes as much as 2x or 3x).<p>Oftentimes you can get away with it from a 1/2x scale fairly easily, but you have to remember there are many android devices at a 1.5x scale, and that can sometimes require completely new rounded corners that take advantage of that pixel density.<p>This is of course anecdotal, but it's not as simple as 'looks' even though I could immediately see the differences between the properly and unproperly scaled images.",1357243367

""I use it to find ____"", and ""Just search for ____ and you'll get something great"". In their own descriptions, this was a resource for discovery and search, rather than simply consumption. Furthermore, they talked a lot about the sharing aspect, ""When I find something great, I will share it"".<p>In my own experience with the site, the search functionality hasn't been great, and it's not a big surprise either. The community hasn't been encouraged to describe the posts with keywords the way that Twitter and Instagram do. Rather than describing things as ""Light Blue Paint Interior"", posts are often described with a reaction to the image ""I really love the colors!"".<p>I've always seen Pinterest as just a visual bookmarking tool with sharing involved. But it now seems to me that Pinterest is becoming a leading social visual search engine.<p>Although the social aspect of the site is well developed and intuitive, I'm starting to see a massive opportunity for Pinterest to improve the search engine aspects of their site. This could be effectively done by introducing functional hashtags (hyperlinked to search, like Twitter) to the site, which would likely be an instant hit with the community due to the pre-selected categories being too general.

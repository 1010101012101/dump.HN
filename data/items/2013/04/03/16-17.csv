I'm much more concerned about my kids growing up in a world where they can't escape sugar and HFCS being added to everything (including meat!) and the impact it will have on them and their kids.<p>Right now, there is no peer reviewed literature that definitively proves the sugar/cancer link. At best, there might be correlation.<p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get any funding for anything that might imply sugar is bad. The US, under pressure from the sugar lobby, threatened to pull $400M in WHO funding if they published a report saying ""Too much sugar has bad side effect, you should limit consumption to 10% of your calories""[1][2][3]. The report was never published. This is made worse by 30 years of dogma, the fact that the FDA won't regulate substances that cause chronic diseases, and the conflict of interest the USDA has with coming up with what we ""should"" eat when their charter is to sell more crops.<p>I'm also not saying that if you don't eat sugar, you won't get cancer.  Statistics apply to populations, not individuals. All I'm saying is there is probably a link between sugar and cancer, and, given sugar provides no positive nutritional value, cutting it out is probably a smart thing to do.<p>My heart goes out to Mr. Banks and his family and friends, just as much as my heart goes out to every cancer victim.

Sure, having people buy less useless stuff is great, but they all still need to agree on a medium for exchange, else doing <i>anything</i> with currency becomes impossible. Individuals buying and selling goods and services don't make currency markets, money flowing through the exchanges does. Market prices are set mostly based on leading indicators from these transactions. When a currency starts deflating, these numbers start looking bad. This is when things start to snowball. Currency worth more tomorrow than today? Stop exchanging BTC for USD(or any other currency). Investments going south and BTC doing well due to scarcity? Then pull out of the markets and hoard BTCs. Market crashed? Get all your BTC out of the bank. At a certain point it all falls apart and everyone is left holding worthless digital currency. This happened before with the great depression and has been studied in great detail. Hence the movement away from the gold standard. Again, very little of this has anything to do with buying TVs and stereos(micro vs macro economics). People don't really need currency to do that anyways. Currency is needed for the exchange of derivatives(specifically debt, AKA loans).",1365006735

It had legible value anywhere so you could use it to defend or attack the means of production: land. People say land was wealth before industry, but ""owning"" it just means having the means to defend it (which could, in modern times, be a legal claim; no one wants most land enough to take it by force) so what you really needed was the metal to fund an army. You were rich if you had gold and could defend the land you had and get more if needed.<p>Between 1800 and ~2075, wealth is debt from an establishment like a nation state or corporation. Being rich means that you can call in favors. You use this debt to build an industrial or business process that gives you a good return on investment. You don't need to own the gold; you just need a certificate saying you had the legal right to it or that someone owes it to you.<p>In 2025, wealth is going to be access to talent. I'm writing a monstrously large blog series and the penultimate post (21 of 22) is going to hint at the economics of that. I'm afraid to get too specific; that might compromise a startup idea that's been percolating in my mind for a few years and might be ripe in the mid-late 2010s. But we're now in a world (convexity) where capital is scarce in comparison to the talent that can do something with it. The new currency (post-2075, I'd guess, because people are conservative when it comes to money; metal and debt currencies aren't going out of business any time soon) will be some proof-of-work model related to technical talent but I've got no idea what it will look like.<p>How to define money in that world is an open question. That said, I don't think we need to get rid of fiat currencies just yet; I don't know what would replace them.<p>With BitCoin, there's no intrinsic value. Someone else could create a ZitCoin with similar structure but not that stupid enforced deflation designed to enrich the first entrants. Now it's a red-ocean with a zillion copycats, so we have ZitCoin and FitCoin (for gym memberships) and PitCoin (for dog breeders) and LitCoin (for getting drunk) and a couple of other *itCoins too crude to mention. Now it's just about branding; most of these alternative currencies (which are too volatile to be real currencies) fail.<p>There's this idea that BitCoin is going to become the next Black Lotus (a $1000 Magic card) but the vast majority of Magic cards have lost value (and all of the cards from the copycat TCGs that flooded the market in '90s). I remember when Shivan Dragons were $25 because a 5/5 flying creature for 6 mana was badass. Last I checked, they were about $2. The thing about a Black Lotus is that (a) it's extremely scarce and indivisible unlike BTC, and (b) there's actually something you can do with it, which is play a powerful Magic card legally.<p>Until you can get 3 mana of any color out of a BitCoin, or drop it from at least 12 inches and destroy permanents based on table position, I'm going to be skeptical.",1365006309

(Likewise, 1 bitcoin would be worth ~ $37.5 million USD.)<p>Now most assume bitcoin will never be the global currency of choice. But even so, it seems to me that the 21 million cap is far too small.<p>In any case, the so-called 'bubble' has every chance of inflating even larger because even if bitcoin traffic were 1% of GDP, you're still talking maybe 700 times the current bitcoin monetary base.<p>That means a reasonable 'target' for a bitcoin valuation in USD might even be well above the current price.<p>I'm not sure where things will go from here, but I'm sure it'll be interesting.",1365005415

If someone had 1 billion in demand for bitcoins it would drive the price up, some would sell hoping to cash out, but others probably more would save seeing this big new interest as a sign of increasing value. You can't count out the sociology and the theater of it. Or other external forces like unstable/untrustworthy national currencies, or the value of relative anonymity.",1365005099
5486925,comment,5486111,5486654,2,0,jcfrei,,,">I think an economy that builds on people buying loads of crap they don't need is at least comparatively bad. We certainly seem to have a problem with using more than we need from the planet.<p>With productivity steadily rising in the developed countries it's gonna be tricky employing 6 billion people. as an example: if all the farmers were as productive as US farmers, we'd need to employ about 0.3% to feed the world. a lot of the ""useless"" products and services (think about the back office of your local government, which is printing documents, scanning them again and the typing them into a computer form) actually employs a large part of the population - have you thought about the implications if 90% of the population is  not required to work?<p>We need inflation, we need people who keep spending their money and hence we'll ultimately need some sort of devaluation. A possible scenario: inflation will be introduced by new cryptocurrencies, which broaden the monetary base. hence it's ultimately the consumers who will steer the rate of inflation (and the adoption of new crypto currencies) and that seems to me like the most democratic thing that ever happened to a currency.",1365005081

Ideally something with an aluminum case, since the screen hinges on plastic case models wear out so quickly.  Something that has accessible panels for upgrading/replacing RAM and hard-disks, without having to completely disassemble the case.  Something with a standard keyboard layout, with real F1-F12 function keys, and a full numpad on the right.<p>Get a cheap wireless/bluetooth mouse that takes AA batteries and turn off the trackpad.<p>If carrying around a 5 lb laptop is an issue, you might want to go to the gym a little more often ;-)<p>Unless you have to do iOS work and need to have XCode, I wouldn&#x27;t pay the 300% Apple tax.  There should be something offered by Acer or Asus for $500-600 that would fit your needs.  Get the cheapest one that has a decent processor/GPU (don&#x27;t worry about the HD or memory, as long as the motherboard supports at least 8GB DDR3).  Throw an SSD and some decent memory sticks in it, and install a clean version of Windows, without all the bloatware, or your favorite flavor of Linux.",1437328735

Second, the GC was made precise, which is a major improvement to a GC.<p>The GC was not made truly concurrent however, and short pause times were not addressed either. These concerns are addressed in the 1.5 release.<p>The trade-off in 1.5 is to eliminate pause times for slightly worse throughput. For the programs Go is written to handle, this trade-off is probably fine.",1437328725

No need to traverse free lists. With malloc you potentially have short-lived and long-lived interspersed with each other, creating lots of holes/fragmentation.<p>> That wouldn&#x27;t require more than a couple of writes and a TLS lookup.<p>While you can just null a reference with a single, unfenced write to something that&#x27;s probably in your L1 cache already.

9912090,comment,9910146,9911273,0,0,kelseydh,,,"Where do you think the most successful web apps (like Slack recently) are emerging?  From the SV echo chamber.<p>To be a talented full-stack web application developer for a <i>successful</i> consumer facing app, you sort of need to have an obsession with UI/UX design trends.  Finished web apps that delight customers have an attention to detail that put them over the edge into the realm of being successful.<p>What you need to learn to become a <i>top</i> web app developer is actually punishingly brutal.  People now expect all web apps to operate with the smoothness of having AJAX everywhere that you see with apps like Youtube, Gmail and Facebook. Web app developers who can actually build web apps to that level of quality are extremely valuable.<p>Web development is not easy if you really specialize in it. By that I mean people who have really accumulated best practices and knowledge over common core problems of the web.  These are the people who within a month can return you an app fully loaded with user accounts, multi-tenancy, notifications, emails, subscriptions, the ability to upload documents, search, credit card payments, google maps, API gateways, chats etc.<p>In addition to having programming chops, a lot of their value actually comes from having spent time collecting good &quot;widgets&quot; of useful software they can use for new projects.  These &quot;widgets&quot; allow them to build impressive experiences quickly. Examples include having an opinion about what a &quot;joyride tour&quot; javascript widget looks like, having an opinion about what makes a good date-time picker, mastering form validation, -- the list is nearly endless, but they all come down to the person having an informed opinion about what UI/UX paradigms are best from a human-computer interaction perspective, and knowing that these paradigms change quickly.  A person who I would call an <i>elite</i> (front-end) web developer is somebody who builds their own widgets frequently just to see what works.<p>Such sideskills of a web developer only come from constant learning.  In my opinion it is one of the most brutal sectors of software in terms of how quickly your skills fall out of date and how much you constantly need to be learning in order to remain competitive.",1437328458

Because it means that to comment on this issue my rape must in turn be deemed legitimate for my words to be legitimate. To be short on details for reasons that I hope a compassionate person might understand, it first started with things that probably don&#x27;t fall under the category of &#x27;rape&#x27; so much as molestation. Sexual assault is the legal term. But I was a child and had to live with this person for years, one half of the family knew and the other half denied everything.<p>I spent years locking my door every night, because if I didn&#x27;t I had to worry about them coming into my room, waking up with their leer hovering over me. I&#x27;ve definitely been traumatized by this aspect. To this day I&#x27;m afraid to sleep with the door open. I rationalize it to myself as a fear of malevolent spirits but it&#x27;s fairly obvious what the true fear is.<p>That&#x27;s probably not good enough for you, and for that I resent you further.<p>Ultimately upon reflection I find that it wasn&#x27;t so much the molestation itself that was particularly bad, at one point in high school I noted to myself that I&#x27;d rather re-experience it once every three days than experience three days of school. (I wasn&#x27;t particularly bullied, I just despised school itself that much.) What was absolutely traumatizing was what happened after. The denial, living with this person that&#x27;s not being held accountable for their actions.<p>Having to deal with the fact that you&#x27;re not allowed to talk about what happened or you&#x27;re a dirty liar, or you&#x27;ll start a huge argument, or this or that will happen.

We&#x27;ve seen improvements on the last two in different ways while OS improvements are hacks piled on hacks piled on original mess. There were attempts to improve performance with purpose-built designs: BeOS demo made desktop scream with performance; QNX smoked microkernels such as Mach; IX did this for dataplanes; mainframes&#x27; Channel I/O gives them insane throughput and utilization (90+%); Intel&#x27;s i432, IBM&#x27;s System/38, Burroughs B5500, Cavium&#x27;s Octeon network SOC&#x27;s, and recent Azul Systems Vega all accelerated critical functions with purpose-built hardware.<p>So, there&#x27;s all kinds of ways to improve things at each layer. Many were done and are being done with vast improvements over the competition of the time period. Why do <i>mainstream</i> OS&#x27;s not improve as <i>mainstream</i> hardware improves? Bad design, bad implementation, and strong desire for backward compatibility that makes fixes hard. Good news is there&#x27;s a niche market and academic R&D that are always creating clean-slate stuff that does it better.<p>Admittedly, though, replacing a full OS isn&#x27;t likely to happen as users reject anything without feature X, app Y, or benchmark Z. The thing is there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of those things in an OS to the point that barrier of entry to building one is insanely high. Even Solaris 10, despite having a hell of a start, cost over $200 million to design, implement, and test. Best shortcut to that I&#x27;ve seen are the Rump kernels.

So it&#x27;s not just the cost of the storage you&#x27;re looking at but also the cost to get that into space. Launches are <i>not</i> cheap, and you have to account for every bit of spacecraft weight which leads to design tradeoffs.<p>Sometimes you can have one or the other--not both.<p>Interestingly, the New Horizons program has its roots dating back to the 1990s, at least according to Wikipedia, with cancellations due to projected costs exceeding levels NASA was willing to fund. But this is par for the course when dealing with long-term, long-distance missions. Everyone has an argument about what to put on board, but there&#x27;s neither budget nor space to accommodate them all (sadly).",1437327635

Starting any company requires so many more skills than just programming knowledge, it becomes very unlikely that a random programmer is qualified. In fact, many  programmers I know are the <i>least</i> qualified people I can think of to found a company -- they lack the ability or desire to sell an idea, manage a team, or motivate people. If you think &quot;I&#x27;m a good programmer, and that makes me qualified to run a company,&quot; you&#x27;ll be disabused you of that notion very quickly. It may turn out that you have the qualifications, but it won&#x27;t have anything to do with your coding ability.<p>The truth is, there are <i>many</i> boxes you need to check, and technical knowledge is just one of them. It&#x27;s very rare that a single individual can check all those boxes. That&#x27;s why VCs generally prefer companies founded by multiple people with complementary skill sets.<p>That&#x27;s also why the OP should seriously consider finding a technical co-founder.

(I remember the days when only Windows was supported and getting Mac/Linux to work with campus networks and services was a huge ordeal.)<p>As an entrepreneur, a lot of tech companies are mobile focused which means iOS is in the mix. To do any native development requires a Mac. And to do pitching/presentations, Macs are very nice for creating and presenting that type of stuff.

Additionally, VCs tend to use iPhones and iPads now...your Mac data will usually interoperate better.<p>For hacking, again, if mobile is a concern, Mac is the only platform that lets you do both iOS and Android. The Unix heritage on Mac makes dealing with the harder areas of Android development easier than on Windows (Linux is okay).<p>If you are doing heavy development, then a Macbook Pro is probably better.

It does feel like Twitter burned a lot of external developers with their API changes & display changes, and the enthusiasm for building niche Twitter clients is pretty small. Maybe I&#x27;m just unaware of them. Anybody know better?<p>I&#x27;d certainly have a better chance of using a Twitter DM app than other IM apps, mainly because between Twitter & SMS I can cover my entire network.<p>There also seems like a reasonable chance that well designed single-purpose apps might attract new & interesting content so open up additional demographics.<p>As an existing user my main gripe with Twitter at the moment is noise.  The spam is worse than ever. The &#x27;targeted&#x27; advertising hasn&#x27;t even reached the uncanny valley. The new retweet-with-comment feature adds pointless clicks to what would otherwise just be a hyperlink. Then there&#x27;s the core problem that Twitter has always had, it&#x27;s users. I want to be able to filter by more than just person... maybe certain people should have their RTs filtered out, or their instagram selfie links.<p>Most of all, I&#x27;d love to be the customer rather than the product.

- thinness affects cooling. You don&#x27;t want your battery get ruined, your CPU throttled and your lap burned.
- expandability matters on the long run<p>I just replaced my 2013 rMBP. I needed the following:
- expandable storage -- I can put 3 SSDs in this<p>- expandable memory - 4 DIMM slots, up to 64G RAM<p>- dockable<p>- trackpoint<p>- can drive UHD screens @ 60 Hz<p>- as Linux friendly as possible<p>- good keyboard<p>- good cooling<p>- IPS screen, min. fHD<p>I ended up buying the HP Zbook 15 G2. The only issue with that is UDH external screens and Linux-friendliness don&#x27;t go together, because those displays require discrete GPU (Broadwells can drive UHD screens through MST, but most displays don&#x27;t support that). The other alternative was the Thinkpad W550s, but I could get the G2 at half the price (and it&#x27;s much more powerful).<p>I didn&#x27;t buy:<p>- smaller devices because I&#x27;m working on this 10 hours a day sometimes, and portability itself wasn&#x27;t enough to compensate for less power, less memory, worse cooling
- Thinkpad .40 series because of their clickpads<p>- Dell Precisions because they&#x27;re extremely bulky and HPs have better keyboard<p>- Macbooks because OSX was not an option for me after using it for 2.5 years, also they don&#x27;t have a trackpoint and their cooling is really abysmal<p>- anything from smaller vendors like System76, etc. because they all use OEM chassis and they&#x27;re a far cry from top-end HP, Dell, Lenovo and Apple chassis<p>I personally don&#x27;t understand how could anyone recommend a 11&quot; MBA to someone who wants to do serious work on it.

It also depends very much on what your definition of low-latency is.<p>For background: we run a betting exhange. Customers will notice and complain if any action <i>with their money</i> takes more than ~100ms. This threshold aligns quite well with old research about human response times [0].<p>On the other hand, if we were running an interactive chat/forum system, it would be acceptable to have >500ms latencies from click to comment display. When it comes to communications, reliable persistence tends to be more important to raw latency. (Or to put it another way: it is okay to delay displaying of a fresh comment until it has been stored. That way the user knows they do not need to rewrite their contribution.)<p>I personally have a background in embedded systems, where hard latency limits are the norm for user experience. Developers, end users and companies are all willing to sacrifice throughput for near-immediate feedback .. and doubly so when the system in question happens to control a vehicle dashboard.<p>At 60 frames per second, one frame refresh is about 17ms. When you need to provide visibly immediate feedback to the user, you have <i>at most</i> 6 frames to display it. Because the data must be available before the rendering of the 6th frame starts, you actually have on average no more than 5,5 * 17ms = 93ms to calculate the response.<p>The real trick is figuring out where you can get away with non-immediate latency requirements. And incidentally, this has knock-over effects: if hard low-latency is not necessary, some GC spikes should be tolerable. Spend the engineering effort where it is crucial, not where it might be nice.<p>At least until you have more workforce than engineering problems.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-l...</a>  (Nielsen, 1993)",1437326096

9911885,comment,9910783,9911839,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> GC could actually be really useful in C++ or Rust for postponing the destruction of many small objects and doing it in one big sweep instead.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this claim before, but I&#x27;ve never understood it. You could add delayed reclamation to your system malloc if it actually helped things: just replace free() with a function that adds to a free list but doesn&#x27;t actually recycle the memory. That wouldn&#x27;t require more than a couple of writes and a TLS lookup.<p>I suspect that the reason why mallocs don&#x27;t do this is that there&#x27;s little benefit compared to just recycling the memory right away. Prompt reclamation is actually really nice for cache reasons, and adding memory blocks to a free list is what free&#x27;s fast path does in the first place.<p>Now that&#x27;s not to say that GC wouldn&#x27;t be useful in C++ or Rust. I think what a GC would be useful for is for lock-free data structures and long-lived structures with dynamic lifetimes, especially ones shared between threads, to eliminate reference counting traffic. But for short-lived objects, if you have any sort of mark phase, you&#x27;ve already lost. Fundamentally, it&#x27;s really hard to beat a system that precomputes the object lifetimes at compile time—which is what manual memory management is—with a dynamic system that has to compute them at runtime.",1437326015

My wife and many of my close friends (that don&#x27;t belong to any particular peer group) are the same way.<p>There&#x27;s a certain irony where, although it sometimes feels lonely being a floater, such people often seem to have higher status when viewed from the outside.

The iPhone was dominant overall around the time of the 3G/3GS, so there are a lot of second hand versions of these in the market, unlike early android ones like the G1 or HTC Hero. In fact, if NI is anything like the ROI, those early Android phones weren't even sold by the carriers. Also, they sucked. Android didn't function well until Froyo/Gingerbread (2.2/2.3) and didn't look good until ICS (4.0).<p>I'm only 1-2 years older than you, but I've noticed in my age group a huge swing from iPhones (or iPod Touch + dumbphone if you can't afford an iPhone or find a second hand one) to mid-range Android phones like the Galaxy Ace (which is probably the second most commonly owned phone among people I know, behind the iPhone 4) by people replacing iPhone 3Gs and 3GSes. The iPhone is still on top, but it's no longer dominant.<p>Also, for some reason I cannot fathom, a small group of blackberry users. Including one who traded in an iPhone 4 for one. I really don't see the appeal, but I guess some people just really like bbm + physical keyboards.<p>(Rough guess of the proportions among people I know is 50-55% iPhone (of which it's mostly 3GSes and 4's - the 4S is non-existent among my friends, which pretty much reinforces my theory that they're not buying new), 35-40% Android, 5% Blackberry, 5% dumbphones.

The current problem is limited to the browser plugin, so the first recommendation makes perfect sense.<p>There are plenty of Java desktop applications that need the Java runtime to be present. You won't know which ones they are until they stop running because you removed Java entirely.<p>Even apps that aren't Java apps per se, like LibreOffice, need Java to be present for certain things.<p>So the tl;dr is -- deactivate the browser plugin, but don't uninstall Java.

(1) I don't use web mail. (2) My MUA of choice\ndoesn't support HTML, so it's not exposed to the risks of HTML\nmail, and obviously, I like it that way. (3) If you wanted to\ncommunicate with me, you'd ether send plain text, or also send\nplain text. (4) I probably have cooked up something to strip\nHTML to plain text for white listed know/wanted senders, but\nall other HTML-only messages are most likely spam, so it's\ndeleted by default, at the server. (5) If the plain text\nportion of your multi-format mail is ""visit this link"", I'll\nblack list you as a spammer. (6) If I'm a paying customer\nand you send HTML-only email, I'll complain, or silently decide\nto never do business with you again. (7) If you send HTML-only\nemails that are difficult to LISTEN to via a screen readers used\nby the visually impaired, I'll actually resent you... or worse.\n(8) Similar is true for other kinds of impairments (physical,\nhearing, ...).<p>The people who will be upset by HTML-only email will fall into\ntwo camps; the disabled, and the security conscious, albeit\nthe latter has some cross-over with the tin-foil-hat crowd.\nIt's not a huge population, and they may not matter to you,\nbut excluding disabled people can be a really bad idea. It\ntakes zero imagination to imagine the possible bad press from\nexcluding disabled people. Worse yet, being on the wrong side\nof accessibility laws can be extremely costly. And worst of\nall, your HTML-only stuff could be accessible, but you could\nstill be accused/sued for it being inaccessible whether or\nnot the accusations have any merit. (read: increased risk).<p>Retaining at a plain text part in a multi-part message along\nwith your preferred HTML is just smart. Plain text may not be\nas fancy, or for that matter, effective, and it does have some\nother known drawbacks (encoding). On the other hand, it's easy\nto do and it prevents you from alienating people and upsetting\npotential customers",1347306070

The Obama bill (note: Obama-supportin' Democrat here) is worse than CISPA: an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink bill that randomly creates incentive programs, new research organizations, a ""cybersecurity tip line"", and federally funds research into DNSSEC (DNSSEC: Rated S for Statutory).<p>Also worth noting: nothing in the Lieberman bill that this EO is patterned on creates enforcement mechanisms for IP and copyright enforcement, or for collecting customer information from ISPs. Of course, neither did the GOP's CISPA bill. That's because neither regulatory effort is about user information.<p>The problems both of these ill-conceived bills are addressing are simple.<p>Problem 1: There is no coherent strategy in the (vast, sprawling, chaotic) federal government, which is the largest IT operator in probably the world. Every agency does something slightly different. This means (a) nobody is doing exactly the right thing (usually, they aren't doing anything close to the right thing) and (b) it is prohibitively difficult to introduce new technology to help fix things, because everyone you'd get to buy it has a different set of hoops to jump through.<p>Problem 2: If you were a foreign adversary who wanted to cripple the US with electronic attacks, you probably wouldn't bother hitting government IT systems. Instead, you'd go for something like the power grid, or a trading exchange. Those systems are privately operated, and so nothing the government does to try to track, monitor, or deflect online attacks can benefit them.",1347305228

But that's not the point of what I was saying. I was talking about speeding up the Python <i>language</i>. That's what PyPy is incredibly good at.<p>I once wrote a small traffic simulation in Python. Not real-time. It would take about 15 minutes to run a medium sized simulation using the CPython interpreter. PyPy ran the same simulation in slightly less than a minute. This is a substantial speedup. In this case it was because function calls can be incredibly slow in Python and PyPy takes care of that.<p>I'm not claiming that implementing parts of the program in C is bad (I'm mainly a C programmer anyway). All I say is that it's not really ""speeding up Python"" when you're not using Python. It's definately an option though and a very good one too!<p>ctypes might not be the best way to do it for some use cases though. In my opinion, the most beautiful way is extending the Python API with native C. That option produces the most LOCs though, and therefore probably more bugs. However, if you've got large portions of a Python program in need of speedup and PyPy won't cut it, it's probably the best option to write a decent part of the low level stuff in C and provide native Python bindings. This way you get the best of both worlds: The performance of C for your underpinnings and the flexibility of Python for developing all the other parts, saving you time and therefore money and sweat.",1347304998

By contrast, adding bits of imperative code inside a functional program requires careful thought and planning to keep from breaking the rest of the program through unexpected side effects.<p>So my suspicion is that OO is ultimately a better ""glue paradigm"" than FP.

An embedded, transparent 1x1 pixel graphic can be used to confirm reception, which solves the single most important problem in spamming and phishing attacks -- verifying that a human read the e-mail. All the recipient needs to do is view the e-mail, and the sender detects that it was received and opened, even when it was read and for how long.<p>3. Embedded links to dangerous sites, an obvious problem.<p>A better question would be ""why is there no nice-looking, but safe, document format for e-mail that has all the aesthetics of HTML but none of the vulnerabilities?"" Such a document format would be easy to create, and without linked graphics or hyperlinks, or any kind of plugin vulnerabilities.",1347304698

ZeroMQ is optimized for high throughput on unreliable networks but sacrifices latency to do it. Most parallel algorithms assume reliable networks and value minimizing latency more than maximizing throughput.<p>As for why no Thrift, ProtoBuf, JSON, etc, it is because those are slow serialization formats that exist primarily for portability and compactness and not for computational efficiency or low latency. You would lose a lot of performance using those for many parallel codes. I wrote an implementation of the ProtoBuf codecs that use faster algorithms than the ones in Google's implementation but raw memory copies are still much faster.<p>MPI is not that useful for distributed systems because of its ""reliable network"" assumption. It is not designed to handle network failures gracefully. ZeroMQ is designed to handle network failures gracefully but is not designed to support parallel applications, only weakly coupled systems. There is a middle ground of tightly coupled, fault tolerant systems that matches many kinds of application use cases but there is no off-the-shelf framework for that (and it would necessarily be more complex than either of the other two cases).",1347303835

It was a lot of ""look how oppressed I am by being downvoted,"" and ""you are so stupid for using godaddy.""<p>You can communicate constructively and effectively without being so asinine. Here is an example of your initial comment with a bit kinder language:<p><i>Unfortunately, GoDaddy's services are often quite lackluster. I would urge current users to switch all their Godaddy-hosted services to other, more reliable providers.<p>Also, always remember to follow security best-practices such as using secure passwords, conducting regular backups, and the like.</i><p>There, was that really so hard?",1347303635

Same thing with Apple introducing new features to iOS inspired by Android or WebOS.<p>If HP had looked at Apple products, and incorporated <i>certain aspects</i> of the design (say, the matte aluminum finish), while adding <i>their own</i> ideas, people would be lauding them for moving things forward. Instead, we have this, which is an outright clone.",1347303620

Because people don't recognize that format.<p>For technical purposes, use a date format with technical advantages (YYYYMMDD). For displaying the date for the user, format it so people can understand it (ex. January 10th, 2013) - and localize it if you have that information, or allow customization, or it all else fails, provide and explanation.",1347303612

If code isn&#x27;t developed in a way that makes refactoring easy then as time goes on the code becomes more complex and it&#x27;s harder to add even simple features without breaking stuff. You may want to look for a developer who knows how to refactor legacy code. If someone recommends a rewrite it&#x27;s almost always a bad idea.",1395626376

And completely current with the wisdom of organizational dynamics, work habits honed by years of what worked and what didn&#x27;t, that person should be like gold.<p>The place where I feel sad is when someone says &quot;I&#x27;ve been unemployed and spent the last 6 months sending out resumes and no one will call me because I&#x27;m old.&quot; Had they instead spent that six months re-tuning old talents, sending out the occasional resume, and building stuff, that seems to get people hired regardless of age.",1395626235

It clearly struck a nerve :)<p>I&#x27;m not invested in my phone as a status symbol at all. I&#x27;m not sure where you got that from. I&#x27;m actually quite uninterested in status symbols, since I don&#x27;t socialize much outside a fixed group of people, and least of all my phone, which currently has a bunch of cracks at the bottom of the screen from an early drop. I don&#x27;t have much opportunity to use it for signalling. I&#x27;d say I use vocabulary and phrasing for general social signalling, and otherwise I prefer unbranded products. The fact that the Nexus line doesn&#x27;t have any brand names on the front of the devices appeals to me, but not because it means they&#x27;re Nexus devices, but rather that I am less of a walking billboard.<p>The connection I saw was that Apple seems to make products that have particular affinity for narcissists - they make products that, for the people who choose them, think they are choosing something excellent, something that makes them feel good about themselves. More than that, they think it represents a kind of excellence that makes them superior in taste and lifestyle to own.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if many Apple products were specifically designed to appeal to narcissists. It would explain a lot of common personality traits in their owners.<p>PS: I don&#x27;t know what an Americanized lifestyle is either.

What I&#x27;ve done, since it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect average service authors to grok <i>n</i>-layers of complexity in the networking/storage/service setup fabric and related security processes, is to reduce the problem to one of rigid developer workflow neatly segregating &#x27;platforms&#x27;, &#x27;services&#x27; and &#x27;cloud providers&#x27;. The latter, which are either external commercial black boxes or your own infrastructure, includes one that implements corosync/pacemaker, writes your cluster rules for you, segments things neatly in to VLANs, dynamically reconfigures routers, disklessly provisions physical nodes, maintains a detailed hardware inventory including all serial numbers, etc. While it&#x27;s impossible to replicate real hardware precisely in simulation, I came to the conclusion that I basically needed this degree of automation to have any confidence that things are working and will continue to work.",1395624456

It has very good sensitivity. For a lark one day, I decided to see if I could read mail through the envelope. So, I fed some junk mail in front of it and found that for non-privacy type envelopes, it was almost as easy to read what&#x27;s inside (top page) as what was on the outside of the envelope. Multiple pages stacked and folded made it impossible to read everything, but you could have read the outer page portion of a tri-folded letter on each side. Keep in mind that I implemented this for fun on a slow afternoon (and it required no special wizardry). Given time and resources, maybe a second camera or different lighting, a lot more might be achieved. Even a naive approach of scanning a letter multiple times under different lighting conditions might be enough to read a large fraction of letter mail. It would take less than a minute. It would not require opening or touching the letter more than an ordinary mail sorter.<p>Now I am not alleging that I think that all mail is stored/read, but I am saying that the tech needed to do that to some degree exists and is at least partially in place.",1395624423

7456131,comment,7455757,7455889,1,0,drawkbox,,,"I think ageism in tech will mature along with the industry as well, that was the first wave and a very disruptive one, so this generation has disruption as a modus operandi.<p>Back then old meant something different as it was a new industry, older people didn&#x27;t grow up with tech and there was a huge valley/difference between someone that gets tech and a generations before that didn&#x27;t have it.  Everyone below 40-50ish (and definitely everyone in their 30s and below) has had tech around their whole lives and at a more core level as it was new and attracted mainly young people then, but now it attracts all people and has had people working in it for decades (past mid 90s when the internet went mainstream, most are still doing it).<p>I have to say working for over a decade in tech/programming that most of the really good programmers were over 30s (and all good product developers were either close or over 30), this is because it takes 10 years to get good at anything even if you start in your teens, shipping products for 10 years can&#x27;t be sped up. Someone out of college at 23-24 needs to work until 33-34 to be really good. To discard that is futile and young programmers might even be scared away from this line of work if there are no future prospects. I also believe it will be detrimental to our entire country as technology is so important now.<p>Funny enough in game development some of the best I have worked with were actually in their 40s nearing 50s even though it is also seen as a young industry, game companies wouldn&#x27;t ship anything without experienced developers of 5-10 years, you can&#x27;t get that experience and then be worthless at 35.<p>When there is a new industry, the people in it at that time sometimes gain more valuable lower level experience because the platforms/layer is still being constructed.  So engine developers that are older were almost always better than younger because they have the core knowledge without the layers of fluff that product cycles can add.  Just like back in the day hardware was more prevalent and a population of people that were in it then are sometimes better at it because they were around when it was big.<p>The market is also solving ageism by paying programmers better than managers many times.  Noone will desire to go manage if it is a step down.  There was a temporary moment in time when there were NO development managers, sales/marketing/bizdev couldn&#x27;t manage it.  So they NEEDED programmers to go into management to make sense of it and they are good at marketing so it stuck in the collective psyche.  That has changed dramatically and I believe this will mature the industry.<p>Also, let&#x27;s not confuse ageism for VC funding selectiveness, they will always choose younger because the term sheet is easier with younger that are less knowledgable about value. The &#x27;problem&#x27; with older coders is they know they can ship and know their value.<p>Who knows, if the WhatsApp guys were younger Facebook could have gotten it cheaper.  If older developers build more value, VCs will see they can flip for higher amounts and that may also help this perception problem.<p>Ageism isn&#x27;t just a problem for older developers, it is a problem for younger developers as well in that they are smart contributors that will be shut off after 10-15 years of solid work, right when most of them will be in their prime and contributing to society.",1395624151

In tech, there seems to be quite a bit of discrimination today against employees who have worked for many years at the same position, and that discrimination is typically aimed at large environments. Startups seem to be ok with hiring older engineers who bounced around and worked in startups in the past, but they usually won&#x27;t give much consideration to a 50 year old who developer has spent the last 25 years at an insurance company or major bank.<p>Take two 50 year old engineers. The one who has had 10 jobs over the past 25 years is considered infinitely more employable than the one with 25 years at the same department of the same company.<p>This case isn&#x27;t ageism, it&#x27;s the expectation of career stagnation, yet many of those engineers with that 25 year tenure think it is. It&#x27;s a leftover from the days when loyalty was tied to tenure, and loyalty was valued highly in the hiring criteria. Those days are over.

Agisim back then was against young people and more the older people working in the industry.  This was born out when a year later a new batch of trainee&#x27;s of which one I was mentoring was actualy being paid twice what I was.  This was soley due to age.<p>I moved on to another company and trippled my salary in the private sector, though again was told by the recruiter if I was over 21 I would of got paid at least £2k more than I was.<p>After a short time I moved into contracting at around the age of 19, doing COBOL work.  Again I had many issues due to ageisim for being so young in what was a old generation feild.  Interviews would be a complete grilling of which I excelled and shone above and with that got the work.  Age was still a factor then and as a young contractor I was often dismissed by people soley due to my age.  Though would always shine above them in technical ability, because I had too.<p>After a few years contracting and the isolation of being a contractor amongst permies(permenant staff) I would feel left out and moved back into permenant work.<p>Times changed, now it is the reverse and sadly I missed both boats, being at the age of 47 and with the IT feild often shafted on many managerial levels I somewhat regret not working in a building trade as many people I know did and made better money, more free time, less stress and burden.  Not forgetting it is a older trade and with that TAX wise more adapt in NI contributions (National Insurance - UK thing) being a pitance on contract to IT, which is full rate.  Then there was the introduction of IR35 desigend to penalise contractors in IT directly.<p>It still is finding it&#x27;s feet and whilst law and accounts have there long standing estabilished exams of recognition, IT still does not.  With any certification easily expiring in a few years and nothing holding up for a lifetimes of work.<p>Sadly that still prevails and IT is often the butt of all departments in many a company and often shat upon, little reward for good work that saves money over other departments who add little value.<p>But during my time, one event stuck out.  I went for a permenant job at a company - PC Database work, Dataease and turned up at reception ontime.  Was left waiting for 30 minutes then handed a form to fill out, which was basicly a HR form regergitating what was already on my CV.  I then had an intervew with the HR manager.  She was very curt and rude and said, that is a lot of money for somebody your age and was very dismissive and really put me off the company.  I had the IT department intervew with a manager and contractor they had in who was an `expert` in the feild.  Shone thru and even educated the contractor about a hidden debug mode, happily answeared the question about post codes in so much detail that it was scary (post codes same as USA ZIP codes).  This resulted in a job offer before I even got home, offering me more than I was (the recruiter) asked for.  I turned it down flat for a lesser paid role as the HR experience had put me off completely from that company.<p>So whilst agisim is a problem, that problem has gone from looking down upon young people, to looking down upon older people.<p>But the real issue of IT and one that will carry on for many years is one of establishment, be it certification and exams that stand the test of time akin to accountants or lawyers.  Until that day, IT will always in many companies be the shat feild for many due to upper managment mentality.  Which ironicly enough is the older people mostly.  Younger managerment (CEO&#x27;s etc) have more respect for IT and also sadly less respect for older people in IT.<p>With that I often wished I was born earlier or later instead of catching the shit-tide from both ends from when I was young and now older.",1395622956

822991,comment,822354,822595,0,0,raganwald,,,"So. Squares violate the assumptions that Rectangles established. Where did these ""assumptions"" come from? Surely the programmers are not looking at the implementation of a class rather than its interface?<p>If we have a language and a system where you have an elaborate vocabulary for constraining the types of messages we can send to an object and the parameters we can associate with those methods but we have absolutely <i>zero</i> ways to constrain what those messages will return and what changes of state those messages will cause...<p>Well then there are going to be these kinds of arguments. I think tools can help here. For one thing, we could use languages like Eiffel that give us Design by Contract that is checked by the compiler. If setting the width is not supposed to set the height, we can make that part of the contract for the setWidth(...) method of a Rectangle and our compiler will not allow us to write a Square class that is-a Rectangle.<p>And alternate approach with less strict languages is to write tests for Rectangle. I'm a big fan of Strict Liskov Equivalence (<a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/04/is-strictly-equivalent-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/04/is-strictly-equivalent-t...</a>). In a project with tests, I believe that any test written for the Rectangle class should work for instances of all of its subclasses.<p>Therefore if we write a test for the rectangle class and we include a check that setting width does not affect height, then a Sqauare cannot be a Rectangle whether the compiler barks at us or not. The test in our project establishes that expectation for all Rectangle subclasses.<p>OTOH, if no such test exists, than the programmer making that assumption is wrong. She should either drop the assumption or add the appropriate tests to the project to document her understanding of the contract of a Rectangle.",1252976218

822989,comment,822575,822832,0,0,spc476,,,"""But Gates was in no hurry for Microsoft to take this same rite of passage [going public].  He did not want to open Microsoft's corporate doors to the public.  For one thing, the company did not need the instant infusion of cash that a public offering would provide.  It was making a great deal of money.  Pretax profits were running as high as thirty-four percent of revenues.  And remaining private had definite advantages.  There were no sockholders to please, no onerous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The only disadvantage was that Microsoft's key employees and managers who had been getting stock options over the years had no tradable security....<p>""Reguardless of what Gates' wanted, however, his hand was about to be forced.  It was only a question of time until the day arrived when Microsoft would have to offer its stock to the public.  The 1934 Securities Exchange Act required all companies to register and file public reports as soon as stock had been distributed to 500 or more employees.  As far back as 1983, Gates had projected that Microsoft would reach that figure by 1986 or 1987....""<p>_Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire_ by James Wallace & Jim Erickson, page 320.<p>For Google, just search for articles around the time they went public.",1252976175

822985,comment,822932,822932,0,0,Tichy,,,"Unfortunately that is far too simplistic.<p>For example eating meat: if you don't eat meat because you love cows, becoming a vegetarian might actually hurt cows. If people weren't eating meat, there would certainly be a lot less cows around than are now.<p>I am all in favor of feeding all hungry people, but once again it is not so simple (note: not trying to pass off hardcore opinions, just thinking and playing devil's advocate). The problem are always the incentives. If you know your children will always be fed, maybe you'll worry less about having kids - you'll just have them. Eventually because of overpopulation it might become impossible to feed everyone. If people worry about having to feed their kids, maybe on average they'll only have kids when they know they can be fed. (I don't know a good solution to this).<p>It get's really bad when he claims that ""people who don't want what they should want are usually just deluded"".<p>The incentive problem goes further - if people are only allowed to get ""equal"" things, competition is eliminated, and hence also progress. In former eastern Germany, there was only one kind of car, made from plastic. It is a bit like with the cows - you think you are helping everybody, but suddenly people are forced to drive in shoddy vehicles endangering their health.<p>As I said, it is a dilemma, I don't know the answer.

We're at the stage now where we are sending out job offers to people we're hoping will become our first non-founder members of our team.<p>The standard practice in such job offers seems to be to say how many options they'll get, but to not include a strike price, and more importantly, not include what fraction of the company that represents.<p>I think that's bogus -- I believe in full disclosure, or at least giving people the relevant data to allow them to evaluate what we're offering.

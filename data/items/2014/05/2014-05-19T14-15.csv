Because then I can&#x27;t judge for myself from what context or perspective the author wrote something. (Is the assertion that mobile market is growing in the context of pre 2008 iPhone, or after?)<p>There&#x27;s many assumptions we take for granted, even when we try to write evergreen. And sometimes those assumptions turn out to be overturned after a while.<p>When I happen upon articles, essays, blog posts, etc without a date, I usually trust it much less, and try to find similar information with a date.<p>The only way you&#x27;ll know if your writing is evergreen, is over the course of time.

7767671,comment,7764483,7766858,1,0,exelius,,,"Netflix is not a replacement for a traditional pay-TV video service, nor will it be. It&#x27;s really more of a premium channel like HBO or Showtime -- both of which already offer streaming for a similar price as Netflix. I see the industry going one of two ways:<p>1) Cable TV over Internet -- in this scenario your cable subscription just becomes an app that runs on a wide variety of devices. Watch live TV, DVR, on-demand, etc. with a user interface that is somewhat reminiscent of what exists today. Channels will continue to be bundled and distributed through cable providers (though I expect non-infrastructure owning companies will also be spun off or started up). This scenario is most likely as it is least disruptive to the financial structure that&#x27;s been set up on the content creation side (also all the big cable/telco companies are building this already).<p>2) Dissolution of the &quot;big bundle&quot; -- in this scenario, the content owners just decide to skip the middleman and become more like Netflix themselves. For example, Disney decides to just offer their own subscription service for $12/mo which gets you ABC, ESPN and the other Disney channels. Bundling would still happen here, just on a smaller scale. This fundamentally changes the business model though, and it will take a long time for content owners to develop the appetite and model to assume the risk of running a consumer-facing service.<p>Until the last 2 years or so, the content owners have also been licensing content to Netflix at low prices -- nobody else was interested in their library content so it was a way to monetize the long tail. But now that Netflix has established that consumers are willing to pay for the content, the content owners are raising prices significantly because the content they own had more value than they initially thought. The existential threat to Netflix is not rising distribution fees, it&#x27;s rising content licensing fees.",1400511342
7767670,comment,7764468,7764468,1,0,thinkpad20,,,"I&#x27;ve been a Haskell user for about a year now, and am pretty comfortable with the language. Ocaml has a lot of things that I like (the module system seems great; strict evaluation is a win; mutability/loops/etc without having to jump through hoops). But every time I look at the actual code, I&#x27;m really turned off by a few things:<p>* <i>let</i>s everywhere, even at top-level. Haskell doesn&#x27;t do this, which is a lot nicer.<p>* <i>let rec</i>. Wut?<p>* Apparently to produce code to run at top-level main loop you just assign it to a <i>let _ = ...</i>, which looks really hacky.<p>* Double semicolons.<p>* Type variables annotated with <i>&#x27;a</i>. In Haskell, lowercase type names are variables, uppercase are constants (or type classes, but those aren&#x27;t mixed).<p>* Mix of semicolons and <i>end</i>.<p>Haskell seems syntactically more elegant, has type classes which are (at least on the surface) more straightforward than modules, though I don&#x27;t know which is more useful at the end of the day.

And as far as i am concerned, there is no good maps app on the iOS appstore that even comes close to google maps. and i think i tried pretty much all relevant ones. skobbler (which i just found out is part of coast) seems to be the most polished. but as long as there is no unified search and you have to enter streetname/adress/city in seperate boxes which excludes searching for the names of buildings (for example university buildings) for which the names clearly exist in the database and are shown onthe map, i have no choice other than switch back to google.<p>i really hope this changes soon and the UI/apps catch up to the greatness that is OSM.<p>edit: i have an iphone  and although i live in canada i still use the german appstore (CC requirement).<p>that&#x27;s why i can&#x27;t comment on the app the original post was about as it&#x27;s only available in the US store. it was more of a general remark about my frustration with the state of apps using the osm dataset.

That said, on the one hand, given time I could&#x27;ve inveigled my way across the org chart into a more stable and less politically dangerous position, and on the other hand, I could&#x27;ve saved myself a great deal of suffering had I simply not shot off my big mouth right at the start.<p>Given that that error cost me an opportunity to redress, free of charge, my lack of tertiary education, I can only evaluate the matter as an overall failure on my part. On the other hand, I did manage to learn a great deal from it, both about office politics in general and about the peculiarly vile strain of same which infests academia, so at least I was able to salvage something from the wreckage.<p>In any case, I can&#x27;t overstate the value of the sort of political caution advocated here. It may be hard to believe if you, as I, first encounter office politics relatively late in your career, but all it takes is to shoot off your mouth just once, and piss off the wrong person in so doing, to completely destroy any future you might have had in an organization. And, sure, any organization in which that&#x27;s possible is one where you might not want to work anyway. But you wouldn&#x27;t be considering taking a position there if there weren&#x27;t some benefit in it for you, and making the same mistake I did can very easily cost you your shot at whatever makes the job worthwhile.",1400510949

There are languages with curly braces and ; that are terribly complicated, with ambiguous complicated syntax (C++), or ambiguous weak types (JS).<p>My way to look at it, if syntax is the biggest stumbling block, that is a warning sign that it will probably be hard to handle more difficult things -- thinking in terms of actors, reasoning about distributed systems, figuring out supervision hierarchies and so on.<p>BUT, as some mentioned here, there is Elixir. You get something like Ruby syntax. And you get variable-reassignment (x=1 then x=2 works). So maybe that helps there too. One still need to learn the semantics of it.

7767541,comment,7766922,7766922,12,0,amirmc,,,"For everyone slating this article, please try thinking of it from a different perspective (and look beyond the buzzwords). Here&#x27;s my take.<p>(paraphrasing) &#x27;In the rush to &#x27;the cloud&#x27; people are disovering that there are bottlenecks related to bandwidth to edge devices (phones etc) and this problem will only increase as more and more devices become conencted (cf Interent of everything).  However, not all services/products <i>need</i> to constantly push data back and forth to a centralised place. There is enough processing power in many devices such that more processing can happen at the edge so why not build more applications this way?  Cisco and IBM see merit in this approach and hope to capture part of a (presumabley nacscent) market by providing some kind of processing ability that is a little nearer the edge of the network, rather than huge datacentres.&#x27;<p>Is that any better?<p>My view on the article is that until developers can more easily build distributed applications, then we&#x27;re stuck with the prevailing paradigm of large centralised services.  I don&#x27;t see how anything from Cisco or IBM changes anything other than having a slew of mini-datacentres that essentially do the same thing.<p>What we really need are the means to create, deploy and maintain software in a more distributed manner. Having all the fancy smart sensors in my home talking to <i>my</i> hub is preferable to having them all talking to their individual silos. At least then, I can excersice some control of what&#x27;s going on within my network and benefit from e.g. my high-speed wireless vs my much slower upstream bandwidth.<p>FWIW I&#x27;m working on an open source toolstack to make building distributed systems a lot more stratightforward. Essentially, we want to get to a place where everyone can own their own piece of the cloud. Whether that ends up being called the &#x27;fog&#x27; or &#x27;dust cloud&#x27; or &#x27;motes&#x27; is beside the point.

I wonder what happens when buggies and fishies nibble at it and water inevitably leaks in.<p>There are some cheaper solutions.  The mosquito dunk costs less than $1 per application and is pretty easy to use--just toss a little puck into a pond, and the bacteria specific to mosquito larvae destroys the pest without causing any known side effects.<p>There are also dragonflies.  They, like mosquitoes, start life in the water and the nymphs are voracious eaters of mosquito larvae.  Then, when they crawl out of the water and grow wings, they eat flying mosquitoes and other small insects in large quantities.<p>If you seed your area with dragonflies, of course they will end up becoming food for bats and other predators which also eat mosquitoes but will preferentially go after larger, meatier insects.  But on balance, a larger number of these creatures will keep the mosquito population down naturally and efficiently.<p>It seems unlikely that introducing dragonflies to a specific area will unbalance the ecosystem.  Dragonflies are ubiquitous in the world except for Antarctica.  They are an ancient species and fossil records of giant dragonflies date back as far as 300 million years.  The mystery to me is why we even still have mosquitoes, when we have such efficient and highly adapted killers of mosquitoes out there.<p>Spraying is perhaps the worst possible approach of all of these.  I&#x27;ve seen spraying done in urban areas that actually resulted in more mosquitoes in some neighborhoods.  It either pushes the mosquitoes into new areas, or it inadvertently kills predators of mosquitoes.  The best thing is to use as natural means as possible.<p>That said... please, please find a way to wipe these critters out of existence.  As discussed a few weeks ago (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7657251"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7657251</a>) there are plenty of non-biting mosquitoes out there; only 200 out of 3,000 species feed on human blood.

7767481,comment,7764483,7766561,4,0,LarrySDonald,,,"Actually the US government spent quite a lot on the infrastructure. Around &#x27;97, I moved from Sweden to the US, after running an ISP there since &#x27;93. Since it was an obvious concern I checked and the US was pumping in slightly more per capita, while being ~40% more population dense. So no problem (I thought) - if anything speed and availability will rocket up faster here. However, back there the government kept control of the lines (not entirely unlike US telecom). Net neutrality was kind of a given - obviously the government can&#x27;t (at least without massive legal changes) give preferential speed to some peoples information directly (i.e. blatant censorship - if you&#x27;re a private enterprise you can limit stuff like that, not so much if you&#x27;re the govt). Back home things rolled along swimmingly, the same crew I ran with back then are still online, some of them whining that they haven&#x27;t pulled gigabit fiber into their areas and have to settle for 100 megabit symmetric. Even before the millennium 10 Mbit symmetric fiber was becoming pretty normal all the way into residences. No one really pulled copper wire for comm anymore really, if a new line went in, fiber. Need to redraw power lines? Throw in fiber. Water? Fiber. Just dug up a sewer line? Throw down some fiber, you never know..<p>Here? I can get 20 Mbit (5 down) in a fairly large town. Some cities have more, but I&#x27;ve seen none where 50 or 100 Mbit symmetric is considered the sort of &quot;lowest tier&quot; broadband (kind of like &quot;at least it&#x27;s not dialup&quot;). For only 2-3x the price. Why? Because no one with the peoples actual interest kept the reins, they just handed shit over to the six majors and told them to get building. Why would they, when they&#x27;re already competing against no one but themselves? Cuts into profit, stuff like that.. So you get to pay more in tax dollars for it, more for the service itself and it&#x27;s way slower. The same seems to be true for korea (et al, the other fast nations), they&#x27;re not spending more, they&#x27;re just negotiating harder with those contracted to build it. Now, Sweden is talking about selling it off (since the whole place is shifting right). Predictably, prices are going up and speed increase is stagnating. Idiots, all of them. The free market rocks for optimizing low entry threshold fields and optimizing already existing solutions. It&#x27;s <i>horrible</i> at things that are mostly infrastructure based, with high cost of entry and nearly all costs being in fixed infrastructure improvement chunks. Highways, telecom, power, water, etc all work the same - if you want to run them free market style, prepare to suffer until you decide to simply join forces and run it jointly without a profit goal bidding it out in small enough chunks to make actual competition possible.",1400508677

7767458,comment,7762805,7764908,2,0,markbnj,,,"I understand your point. There is a step that compiles python source to bytecode, and it does take place before the bytecode is executed. I just think this is a somewhat pedantic observation. A large part of the value of the language lies in the immediacy of its &quot;interpreted&quot; nature (I&#x27;ll put that in quotes from now on, thanks to you :)). You run the script and it either fails or executes. In the version of python I use on Ubuntu scripts aren&#x27;t compiled to bytecode for the first time until they are imported, so other code in the project has likely already run before the compiler would have a chance to review the use of types in the imported module. There isn&#x27;t a project-wide process of compiling all the files and making sure everything is used correctly before any code executes. Maybe it could be made to work that way, but wouldn&#x27;t that alter the language and the way it is used? In the end I come back to: is AttributeError really not descriptive enough?

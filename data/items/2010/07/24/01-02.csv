The picture of gifted children breezing through school is often painted without a second thought. From following the popular narrative of the elementary school and middle school classroom, you'd think that every above average student is a carbon copy of Lisa Simpson. The greater hurdle in my mind is that school caters to the average student. The most successful student in many cases is probably the very average child. Being excessively inquisitive and driven makes the classroom hell, because the system seeks efficiency, and that means punishing the margins for not fitting in with the crowd.<p>Sorry, but when I read ""[s]chool work is a breeze, resulting in a little to no stress ..."" it hits a nerve! :)",1279934970

Give each candidate a fixed amount of government funding for their campaign.  Nobody is allowed to solicit campaign contributions of any kind or permitted to spend their own money, so everyone is on an even playing field.  The quantity of funding depends solely on the particular office that the person is running for.  You don't get to choose what office to run for; there is a lottery for each individual office.

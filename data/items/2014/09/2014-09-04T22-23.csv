He <i>has</i> moved on; it&#x27;s just that, now that someone wants to pick up the baton he discarded so long ago, he&#x27;s fussed about someone else getting the benefit of what has heretofore served him as a neat, low-effort little generator of social-marketing capital.<p>I might even have some sympathy for that perspective, if not for the fact that his disinterest in doing anything with Markdown has resulted in such a broad range of subtly incompatible forks, thus complicating many people&#x27;s lives, mine included, for what strikes me as frankly no good reason at all.<p>Let him sue, if he likes, or let him keep unfavorably impressing people with public bitching and moaning -- or let him do the sensible thing, if he hasn&#x27;t yet entirely foreclosed that possibility, and try to walk back his recent bitter outbursts in favor of a public opinion on the lines of &quot;I sure wish I&#x27;d had the time to do this sort of thing before now!

If you did this for Indian celebrities, VCs in India would throw eight figure sums to buy you out.\nAs an immigrant, I&#x27;d say Americans are relatively more rational ie. not so celeb-crazy as to completely remodel themselves after a celebrity, though teens, especially teen girls tend to be an the outlier in this aspect.

8271161,comment,8268642,8269120,4,0,bunderbunder,,,"The idea that expertise matters is fine.<p>Where meritocracy gets bad isn&#x27;t the &quot;merit&quot; part, it&#x27;s the &quot;-ocracy&quot; bit - the idea that people who have the most merit get to call the shots.<p>It&#x27;s problematic in all sorts of ways.  First, who gets to define merit?  Well, probably the meritocrats.  If we assume they&#x27;re rational agents (which we must, by definition), then they will choose to define merit in the most self-serving manner possible, in order to consolidate their own position, status, and power.  And even if we don&#x27;t assume they&#x27;re perfectly rational agents (which is more likely, if contradictory to the basic idea behind meritocracy) we should still expect to see self-serving definitions of merit that grow organically out of everyone&#x27;s bias for their own perspective.  Consider the history of racial bias in IQ testing, for example.<p>Second, by the people who merit the highest in a meritocracy have different backgrounds, and therefore slightly different interests, from everyone who&#x27;s lumped together in the lumpy part of the bell curve. This is inevitable - in a world where education costs money, you&#x27;ll have a hard time getting to be the most educated at anything without coming from a position of relatively greater economic privilege than others.  Pythagoras was no peasant, nor was Galileio or Newton or Einstein or Feynman.  Therefore, we should not assume that they will make decisions in accord with the best interests of society as a whole. And their current circumstances are probably sharply different from most others&#x27; too. Probably the person who knows more than anyone else about investment banking is himself (I think we can safely assume it&#x27;s a he - see below) an investment banker.  That by no circumstances means that this person is the most fit to dictate investment banking regulation.  It&#x27;s true that he&#x27;s got the expertise to draw up a set of rules that will encourage almost any outcome, but the outcome we should all be most worried about is the one where investment bankers get outlandishly wealthy at the expense of everyone else.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s impressive how effectively people can use their pre-existing merit to influence others&#x27; ability to acquire merit.  Often their ability to do so is so well-honed that they can wield it almost constantly without even realizing they&#x27;re doing so.  See: White men in academia, white men in fraternities, white men in software development, etc.",1409871537

8271153,comment,8270023,8271079,1,0,mareofnight,,,"Basic meaning: doing a thing to send a message about yourself to others. Like wearing expensive brands to signal that you&#x27;re rich.<p>But <i>good</i> signalling involves some additional factors. Signalling is usually used when you want to say something about yourself, but it&#x27;s something that people would want to say about themselves whether it was true or not, so you have to say it in a way that is difficult or impossible to fake. A good signal is one that is highly visible (in the context where it matters; clothes are good for in-person signaling, profiles or photos are good for online signaling), and either cannot be sent without having the quality they&#x27;re supposed to signify (you can&#x27;t afford expensive things to show off if you don&#x27;t have money), or are much easier to send if you have that quality than if you don&#x27;t (it&#x27;s easier to get a high StackOverflow score if you&#x27;re good at programming and communicating than if you&#x27;re not).<p>If you&#x27;re giving employees extra stock to signal loyalty and trustworthiness, it&#x27;s &quot;cheaper&quot; to do that if you actually value being loyal and trustworthy (rather than just wanting others to think that of you), because then you get value from being the sort of person you want to be <i>and</i> being thought well of by others.

8270960,comment,8269316,8270658,19,0,xnull,,,"These middlemen are a kind of legal pimp that exist all over the United States.<p>Salons are middlemen for hairstylists. Hollywood middlemen for movie directors. Labels are middlemen for musical artists. Google is a middleman for advertizers/people&#x27;s private information. At a larger scale, credit card processing companies are a middlemen between EVERYTHING.<p>The pimp/middleman taxes what would normally be a direct market transaction between two willing parties. Presumably in a free market (we&#x27;re getting crazy here and granting classical market analysis some of its claims), two parties will undergo a transaction only if it benefits both parties. This is one of the fundamental justifications for market systems of wealth distribution and social organization. (It ignores whether the transaction hurts third parties to that exchange - externalities - but that&#x27;s a side discussion).<p>What a pimp does is take some of the value from the transaction for himself in return for organizing the transaction. In cases where the pimp hasn&#x27;t actually added any value (he wasn&#x27;t really required for the exchange) he is said to be &quot;rent seeking&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking</a>). The classical example of this is chaining over a public river system and charging people to run their boat down it. In this case no value has been added to the river by the chaining, in fact value was extracted and concentrated into private hands.<p>The situation is less clear when the pimp does add some value. In the case of prostitution a pimp provides security and a first check that the &#x27;John&#x27; isn&#x27;t law enforcement. In the case of credit card companies, they facilitate the exchange of dollars over wires and track down fraudulent transactions (security). In the case of Uber, they provide checks on customers and checks on renters (security). Security is popular. But it isn&#x27;t always the case. Some pimps provide an upfront investment in machinery, such as mirrors/air conditioning/shampoos. Other times the pimp takes a financial risk.<p>It isn&#x27;t always clear when a middleman is a good deal. When is your pimp robbing you as an employee? As a customer? As a service provider? Many small and medium businesses struggle with credit card processing fees as the charges cut into what are usually small profit margins to begin with. Having built the infrastructure once and not having improved on it, do credit card processing companies deserve 3% (I don&#x27;t know what it is) of every monetary transaction? That&#x27;s half of most sales taxes, but it goes into private hands. Is the value of providing that infrastructure enough to justify the costs? After how many years does an infrastructure have be in place before it is considered a public good?<p>The internet was supposed to be democratizing in that it would facilitate direct transactions where there weren&#x27;t any before. People with information could get it to those that needed it without having news organizations filtering it. Musicians could release without labels taking their cut. Coders could sell programs without coordinating with software stores. But today there are appstores and there are wire transfer services and there are online banks and online social filter systems. Google, Paypal, Comcast, smartphone and device manufacturers and carriers, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Apple store, etc all take their slice.<p>When is it okay to put a chain across a river? What if the river is first dug deeper, or if someone puts up signs? And how long is it okay to leave the chain up?",1409868605

We&#x27;d already built a nice location and social app but eschewed the VC cash to, dare I use the word, pivot, and build a different way of building apps.<p>Instead of building another one-off social-location-system like Foursquare, we decided it better to build a federated platform that others can then start building on. The federation and run-it-yourself mentality means that our users don&#x27;t end up in the Twitpic scenario and that there are always other suppliers that will host your pictures in a compatible way. In a way that fosters competition between providers without needing to resort to switching friction cost to keep users.<p>In the Twitpic case, the buddycloud media server is designed to be a plug-in federated media hosting provider for each domain.

I saw many similar guides/reviews of programs that were way behind sched and over budget. All written by retiring/recently retired upper management, they&#x27;d come in under a budget provided by some government oversight company or consulting group. They&#x27;d poke sticks into every group, come up with their assessment, then drop it on the active program director&#x27;s desk.  The program director would assign actions, the gov&#x27;t oversight group could check off the box that it participated in &quot;program saving&quot; guidance, and 3 months later everyone forgets/ignores the input.<p>I think this guide paints a clear picture of how inefficient and misguided gov&#x27;t run programs are for those that can stand to see it.  The irony is so strong in the title, it&#x27;s verging on sad. It is hard to believe anything ground breaking or efficient was ever created by following a &quot;100 Rules&quot; guide.",1409868208

I went to a small, solidly ranked liberal arts school.

Don&#x27;t confuse limited ability to predict with impossibility. We can make many confident statements about the likelihood of certain behaviors/reactions/response, in the aggregate, under given real-world circumstances.<p>You are correct in that much research, especially research older than 10 years ago, tended to ignore culture. I know my field of study (I/O Psychology) references cultural frequently, either through overt study when possible (desirable given the publication potential) or at least remarking on the limitations of any findings. I don&#x27;t read much outside I/O research though, so maybe it hasn&#x27;t progressed much on the whole and the global nature of I/O work for businesses rewards more recognition of culture. It&#x27;s hard though - accessing globally-relevant datasets for studies of human behavior is often impossible. That doesn&#x27;t make all studies meaningless, or unscientific.<p>And yes, you&#x27;re correct about value-laden framing of results.

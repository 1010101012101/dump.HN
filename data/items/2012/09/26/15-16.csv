This is a long and annoying transfer, which Google probably picked up on.<p>* 6/NR -> L -> ACE (probably not)<p>Since Embark's map is the stylized subway map, it doesn't really help with geographic locations.<p>There are other situations like this: should I take the J train at Bowery directly over the bridge and walk for a while on the other side, or should I walk to the 6 and take the L train under the river, getting off much closer to my destination? The estimated walking time factors into this - if there's a J train about to arrive and I'll narrowly miss the 6, the answer is obvious.

Here's some reasons why...<p>1. with advancements in technology, education too needs to evolve, but we are still stuck in the era of printed books and expensive text books. I remember seeing a computer for the 1st time in grade 7. It took me few years to understand the complete potential and how I can use it. Now, kids in pre-school are hooked to iPad games and have figured out ways to watch cartoon on demand. Thus going to school to learn about animals from textbook pics is not very inspiring and interesting.<p>2. For higher education, the school text books are still stuck in the 90's technology. School needs to engage students with more hands-on work, rather than lectures. Hands-on project building and training is a very useful tool for learning and has proven to be more engaging among students of all ages.

Even if you completely fall on your face and every idea you have is a bust, you have some skills that will help you with your next business venture or (god forbid) getting a job. If you play poker for two years you have none of that.",1348674500

They got burned with Silverlight and the first drop of the Foundation series of products and Entity Framework.<p>Not one dev saw that coming with those APIs?  I don't believe it.   Microsoft in the 2000s has been all about throwing APIs against the wall and then deprecating them.  Anyone who has been around Microsoft knew this was a risk with Silverlight.<p>I think the real reason these particular devs got burned is because is because Windows today is like Mac before MacOS X: it's all about incompatibility with the rest of the world, ""doing it better"", crap like that.  MVPs are happy to go along with it and adopt these technologies because they can keep their position of being important in the ecosystem.  It's like Apple fans in the 90s. WPF, Silverlight, EF, all this stuff is akin to Apple's OpenDoc, or Dylan, or even Newton.  It's shiny technology in an incompatible vacuum.<p>On the topic of the Windows app store.  When Apple made iOS, they took components of MacOS X as the foundation of iOS.  But when they released the Mac App Store, they didn't force developers on MacOS X develop to the iOS API.  That's what Microsoft is trying to do here.  Develop with RT or Metro or GTFO.  Pure idiocy.  The next step is predictable:  Microsoft will have to step in like they have on WP7 and they'll start offering to pay for other people's development costs to do the port.

If you and I both like movies, wine, cooking and travel, we probably will both like the same kinds of movies, books, or trinkety, Etsy-style gifts.<p>Our difference is that we directed ourselves at the frustrated masses who were trying to find gift ideas, and couldn't come up with any, which turned out to be very difficult to sell, in terms of the right marketing message.

4576134,comment,4575260,4575752,8,0,chime,,,"I don't think it would work in exactly the same way you are describing but there may be alternatives. Manufacturing equipment is very expensive and the only way to justify the cost is to keep it running daily, sometimes 24/7/365. The change parts for each unique product are also quite expensive (easily $10k+). If I want to open a KickManufacturing plant, I have to buy/maintain/service hundreds of different kinds of equipment which includes the cost of the hardware, software, and technicians. On top of that, each new product will barely have 10k - 100k units ordered if I'm lucky. After that the change parts are useless. The other problem with this is the manufacturing equipment that can do lots of different configurations is slower, error-prone, and more expensive than specialized equipment that does just one thing. So if one of the Kickstarter products does become a success and they want 100m units, you need to buy new equipment or source a better large-scale manufacturer. And worst of all, most of the equipment will be collecting dust 95% of the time unless someone has just the right Kickstarter project for them.<p>What most entrepreneurs spend their time between getting funded and beginning shipment is finding the right manufacturer who can allocate runtime on their lines. The manufacturers lose money when the lines aren't running. The entrepreneurs get delayed when the lines are busy. This is a very complex B2B market that has no current solution. If someone solves this problem, we can have significantly better fulfillment of Kickstarter orders.<p>Such a site would have manufacturers periodically uploading capacities and capabilities of their equipment, warehouse/distribution resources, and costs associated with each line/product-type by time/quality. The entrepreneurs would be able to book the best-fit manufacturer (be it in US, China, or Norway) and pay a reservation-fee to the manufacturer which sits in escrow pending successful contract. The reservation-fee would be high enough to deter fake orders and be credited towards the actual product order. The site could fund itself by collecting interest on the escrow or charging per new B2B relation.",1348673578

They're likely to be very different at an interpreter/compiler level from a language that happens to allow you to avoid side effects and mutability, but isn't designed to know when you're doing that or to optimize for it. (I'm thinking, for example, of the insane way Clojure implements dictionaries under the hood in order to efficiently copy them rather than edit them in place, which in turn enables its approach to efficiently rolling back and retrying operations that contend for the same shared transactional memory.) The upshot is that an imperative language like JavaScript will let you borrow some nice techniques from the functional world, but won't have a lot of the benefits of a language that's designed to <i>only</i> be used that way.<p>Again, no idea what I'm talking about, that's just the impression I have from the little I've learned about functional programming so far.",1348673206

Asking to wish you luck sounds like you're not entirely confident about your decision. Furthermore, posting here on HN makes it look you've already achieved something, but it's really just the beginning.<p>Whenever I intent to do something important, I never tell anyone in advance. It's not about fearing to be looked at as a failure in other's eyes. It's about not considering taking a decision as an achievement.

Most of the time you can just augment your API with new end-points and keep the old paths around for backward-compatibility. When you're ready to change the major version you might as well start a new service from scratch with everything that you have learned.<p>Now that all your responses have a non IANA-approved[1] content-type, standard clients won't see it as JSON by default. Your curl requests are longer to type because you have to add this '-HAccept:application/vnd.something+json' string to your them. The reality is that bad developers will have broken clients when you update your API in any case.<p>I'm grateful that the REST movement brought attention to follow the HTTP protocol more closely but in practice, nobody writes truly RESTful clients. For that you would need to write a client that follows URLs passed in the body or in the headers. For example if you implement pagination, you're supposed to fetch page 1 and then follow the links until you're at the page you want. In reality you just make a page= attribute convention that avoids all these unnecessary round-trips.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html</a>",1348671726

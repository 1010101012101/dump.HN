Source: I work in the guts of some of the biggest telecom networks on the planet.<p>Federation is a problem because none of the standards interop.

I believe it was Elad Gil who said that services that eschew privacy have historically dominated their more private opponents. Users say they care about privacy but their explicit value systems (what they say versus what they do) says otherwise. The majority of consumers are happy to take iMessage and use it to the extreme and will attribute silent failures to the operators in most cases (which is not necessarily wrong).<p>True federated identity is the death of the phone network and there are just too many billions of dollars tied up in the world for this to come to pass. A phone number is a ridiculously arbitrary identifier for a person, and yet it works and has worked for quite some time. Logically addressed networks are finally starting to break, and that&#x27;s a good thing, but the catalyst that will move us away from these systems is one that subsumes existing infrastructure while adding new features. You cannot rip and replace our communications networks (or any infrastructure for that matter) and so the only logical solution is to subsume.

For instance, go ahead and take a quarter out of our your pocket, flip it into the air and see how it lands on the floor.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to predict whether it comes up heads or tails, right?

Doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re always right, but there&#x27;s rigorous and principled methodology at work, results shift belief in the explanatory power of this model or that, and the field moves forward.<p>So yeah, there are bad practitioners and bad papers and overbroad explanations, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that nobody knows anything.",1391372595

Its possible you&#x27;re not rinsing under flowing water.<p>Also consider the ratio of sink size to dishwasher size, which is a fad/style issue.  My kitchen sink doing a realistic sinkful of dishes only holds perhaps 1/4 the dishes my washer holds.<p>It seems difficult, although not impossible, to buy a non-energy star dishwasher which means less than 6 gallons per load.<p>One point that everyone seems to miss is the amount of soap and biomatter being flushed thru the pipes is a constant, no matter if you handwash and use 20 gallons or use a machine and only use 5 gallons.  So I donno about sewer system efficiency given an intake flow that might be 4 times more or less dilute.<p>I can do one dishwasher full of dishes using about 6 gallons, or about 3 to 4 sinks full, each maybe 10 gallons, for a total around 30-40 gallons.  I believe this estimate to be true... in the ancient years of hand washing and old fashioned tanks, I could use up all the hot water in a 30 gallon hot water heater after thanksgiving by the end of dish time.   Now that I have the tankless that will never run out, even after a handwashing thanksgiving, ironically I also now have a dishwasher which means I use practically no hot water anyway.

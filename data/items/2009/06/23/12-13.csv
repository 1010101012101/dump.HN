670269,comment,670204,670234,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Thanks.  You've probably heard about me on Hacker News.  I post here way too often.<p>A few notes:<p>1. I've asked a few times, and sent out press releases now and then.  It's an intellectual challenge though for me to pitch people I consider my friends.  Frankly, I think it's unethical and it puts them in a really tough spot where I'm just another person asking them to write about them.<p>2. Funny you should mention those cats. I've sent a few of those guys updates on a regular basis over the last 16 months, after all, I'm trying something new and seeing some results, but I've never heard back from any of them.  I've not tried Mr. Winer and will send him a note, but I've grown pretty skeptical as to whether the ""death of newspaper"" guys are actually interested in new ideas, or just ideas that conform to their own.  Part of the reason I spend so much time on Hacker News is because the journalism community isn't so interested in startups, but in saving their existing brands in my opinion. I don't really fit into that.  I've got more in common with the Bingo Card guy then with someone starting a non-profit news organization supported by rich friends of his and foundations.<p>3. I went to Medill and consult for them on occasion.  For this reason, they've more or less said their student reporters can't write about me, though I guess I made the alumni magazine this month (LOL).  The school's had me in to speak to students pretty regularly, which has been a great source of interns.",1245761347

From what I understand, you engineer self-assembling (self-replicating, even?) components then can shape the process with various GA selection criteria / fitness functions. Interesting stuff goes in, and (hopefully) way more interesting stuff comes out.

I've been thinking about implementing it on our web app at aleveo.com like that.\nLet me elaborate.<p>We all know that having a simple and usable register/login form increases signups. Let that aside, I've kicking out everything of our forms until really only the necessary. Among those things is the repeat password/email field, username (enough with those) etc. However, what if caps is on, or the keyboard layout is other and so on, the person will signup for your service, but next time he wants to login, if he is having issues with the form, you're done. He'll blame you, as he think he knows what he types as a password.<p>It is essentially wrong not to see what you are typing.\nIf you noticed, Mr.Nielsen didn't go into implementation. He said that the concept is legacy. A good implementation would be having a checkbox next to the password field ""[] show text"" or similar, default unchecked.<p>An older person would definitively appreciate that, but it is not only for them, as it happens to me too (24 year old) to mistake until I figure out what I am really typing in (first keystroke swallowed, typing mistake, caps, wrong layout, etc)",1245758887

670204,story,,,43,44,brandnewlow,"Ask HN: What am I doing wrong here? (PR/Marketing an app)",,"Bit of a head-scratcher here.<p>I run a social news site for Chicago over at WindyCitizen.com.  Since a massive redesign back in January, I've seen its traffic, activity, and influence grow steadily.<p>Problem: I've been really successful so far in working WITH the local media.  But completely unsuccessful in getting any coverage FROM the local media that I could show to advertisers to let them know we're legit.  I knew it would be tough to launch something aimed at a market without a ""Techcrunch"" to speak to early adopters, but this is getting ridiculous.<p>Here's what I mean:<p>1. I've hammered out partnerships to have our submission/voting buttons on the local alt. weekly site and all major local blogs. This was a nontrivial feat.<p>2. The local CBS affiliate has added our top stories widget to its site.  Also nontrivial.<p>3. Journalists from every local publication have glommed on to us and are posting their stories to the Citizen on a daily basis.  Of our 2000 members, I estimate we have at least 50 Chicago journalists among them, including editors and deputy editors who are posting stories and leaving comments on our site on a regular basis.<p>4. Last month we had over 4000 stories and events posted and reached about 80,000 people.<p>So these journalists are all using the Citizen and these publications all want our traffic (because it's local), but no one's ever run a ""hey, check out this cool site!"" story on us.<p>I'm beginning to think the statute of limitations for that happening is running out.<p>I've also had zero luck getting coverage from tech blogs.  I've assumed that's because the site's aimed at Chicago.<p>I think part of my problem is that I have a background in journalism.  The idea of aggressively wining and dining reporters at local papers, courting them and calling them up all the time to tell them what's new is pretty gross to me.  I e-mail a good number of folks when we have news and have made friends with a lot of local media, but no dice on the coverage front.  It's very humbling.<p>Clearly, I'm doing something wrong here.

So whenever my colleagues or students are working with me on something and I have login to my email or whatever system I need to get to, it's not bad enough that I have to feel uncomfortable that they can see my keyboard while I type my password but they can just look at it on the screen. I guess this is what happens when you actually let ""usability experts"" design your systems.<p>As for this ""checkbox,"" how many users will unwittingly have their online identity stolen because regular users aren't thinking about whether they need to select some checkbox before they type in their passsword. Also, that seems more annoying than more usable.<p>As someone else mentioend, this makes ""remember password"" totally unworkable; though personally I don't like that feature either.<p>There is a difficulty in mobile devices but that is because typing on such devices is not really great in terms of usability.<p>The other thing is that I don't think there is much evidence that this is really a problem.

1939203,comment,1939138,1939138,0,0,blhack,,,"Netflix represents what I think is going to be the next paradigm in content delivery.<p>The goal of the media companies (at least should be, it seems like some of them have forgotten), like the goal of any business, is getting their product from its place of production to its place of consumption.  Consumption, in the case of television and film, happens behind my eyeballs; in my brain.<p>For the longest time the only way to do this was to get everybody together at a pre-determined time and play it for all of them at once.  Imagine a time before the ubiquity of print, imagine somebody standing in the center of a crowd reading from a bible.  <i>That</i> is the current system of content delivery.  Everybody get together in a big crowd (although the crowd can be distributed) and the transmitter is going to shout some bits out into the air.<p>Netflix (and online delivery in general) means that we don't have to do this anymore; we've invented the printing press.   <i>Everybody</i> can have a copy of <i>every</i>thing.  We can all access it whenever we want.<p>I understand why the cable companies don't like this, they're the ones that made the megaphones that the people standing in the center of the crowd shouting out words from a book have been using.   They don't want printing presses because then it means they can't sell megaphones anymore.<p>(I hope this analogy makes sense...)<p>The content <i>producers</i> should be ecstatic about this.",1290653492

At the same time, a public that is largely apathetic about politics in general is easily moved by fear-mongering, us-vs-them rhetoric, etc. -- like any fad, terrorism simply captures the imagination of some people.<p>Attempts to stop the overreaction suffer from the typical challenge: the majority who don't care about terrorism care about the issue less than the vocal minority for whom it's a very big (as in scary or as in profitable) deal.<p>Also, due to the government's habit of paying for terrorism prevention, the typical corruption/overspending problems happen far more easily than they would in a decentralized system.  And, due to the political nature of terrorism prevention, our leaders work to minimize the extent to which they would likely be blamed for an attack rather than working to make us feel/be safer.",1290652795

They're closer to repositories where papers get filed away. The sub-field I care about publishes regularly in 5-6 journals/conferences, and somewhat less regularly in another 15-20 or so, so what I really want is the non-existent <i>Journal of the Stuff I Research</i>, whose centroid is my own research. In reality, that journal is scattered across a bunch of other publications, but Mendeley makes some effort to reconstruct it for me.<p>Just following something super-broad like <i>Science</i> or <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, though, isn't as useful to me, because the vast majority of papers just aren't going to be relevant to my research.",1290651229

This, I believe, is not fair. E (J) differs from m (kg) by a conversion factor of c (m/s) ^2. To give an analogy, I think it would be misleading to say that an electric field E(r) is a different word for some charge Q, because without one you cannot have the other, and they only differ by some conversion factor.

(via <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1937062"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1937062</a>), discussing
the problem of finding a regular expression that matches
the binary numbers that are divisible by 3.<p>The author of that post solved it more or less by trial-and-error,
but – as some commenters on that thread already pointed out – there’s
actually a fairly straightforward algorithm that works for any divisor
in any base.<p>I thought it would be a fun exercise to implement the algorithm
in Javascript, and here is the result. It's quite fun to play with.<p>Even though (obviously) I understand how it works, it's still
somehow surprising to see a regular expression that matches all
the multiples of 7 in base 10, for example. (That example is quite
a hairy one!)",1290650770

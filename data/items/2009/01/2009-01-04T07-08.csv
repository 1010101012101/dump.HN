Hometown is a relatively small site, but what if for some reason Google decided to shut down Blogger tomorrow? There's huge swathes of the useful internet on that domain, and no legal recourse right now if Google lose all that data -- it's a free service, with no guarantees.<p>It seems like maybe some very lightweight legislation guaranteeing some level of access to data <i>would</i> be a good idea, for services above a certain size -- maybe 1m+ users or something.",1231055825

Note that all these optimizations are viable (to an extent) with languages such as Haskell, C# and Java.</i><p>You seem to imply that they're viable because those languages aren't as dynamic as Python. Yet Smalltalk and Lisp (edit: and Javascript) are at least this dynamic, and have implementations that go far beyond this. In fact Java's (edit: and V8's) JIT technology came from the Smalltalk world.",1231054927

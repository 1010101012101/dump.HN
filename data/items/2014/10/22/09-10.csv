You form directory structures, and those long keys get mapped to files on disk with their value as the file contents.<p>What really bugs me about these solutions -- confd, consul templates -- is that managing templated configuration files isn&#x27;t as quick, but has been trivially possible with normal configuration management tools since their inception.  When I think of managing HAProxy configurations, for example, I don&#x27;t see Chef as a bottleneck.  I can parallel SSH and run Chef on those hosts in 20 - 30 seconds.  I don&#x27;t care about the configuration being pristine, either.. because that&#x27;s what backend health checks are for.   That extends to a lot of their examples, but it&#x27;s one of the ones that stuck out to me.<p>The things that I think are hard, or harder, are small bits of data, like database credentials, etc.... where people absolutely don&#x27;t want to be making an HTTP call for every single thing, or don&#x27;t want to define a template for hundreds of individual files that might be needed.  That&#x27;s a real bottleneck - you need something on top of these solutions to manage that.  So for every file you care about being updated fast... you still need to manage a corresponding file.<p>I don&#x27;t know necessarily how to solve that -- I treat K/V pairs as file name/contents pairs in my tool and don&#x27;t think twice -- but it definitely feels a bit wrong.",1413971970

8492057,comment,8491328,8491473,0,0,anovikov,,,"Same way Orbital was awarded vastly more for CRS contract, by even larger margin. Reason is simple and completely valid: both Orbital in 2008 and Boeing in 2014 have much higher chances to perform to the expectation. So SpaceX makes a discount for risk.<p>In 2008, SpaceX did only 4 launches, of which only 1 successful, of much smaller light Falcon 1 vehicle, Orbital built 2 distinct successful launch vehicles - Taurus and Pegasus - and apart from that, it built complex satellites, being a company with 25+ years of experience and much more funding and track record. Should 2008 CRS contract be awarded today, it would be probably much different because now SpaceX appears more qualified.<p>Same applies to Boeing today - for all achievements of SpaceX, Boeing is a nearly 100 year old company which was in space business since before the space age, and about two orders of magnitude larger - for them, CST-100 is a simple device not presenting much technical risk.",1413971723

If you transform your data, and then do a linear regression on the transformed data, and then un-transform your regression line, that&#x27;s <i>not</i> the same as doing non-linear regression. Linear regression makes the assumption that the data is a line + normally distributed errors with 0 mean and constant variance.<p>For example lets take regression for an exponential relationship. If you transform your data with log, and then do linear regression you are assuming that your transformed data fits a line with normally distributed errors with 0 mean and constant variance. This means that you are assuming that your original data fits an exponential + normally distributed errors with 0 mean and <i>exponentially increasing variance</i>. This might be a good assumption, but it might not be. It depends on what your data is. If you look at his data [1] you see that the variance is increasing, so that indicates that his method is OK for that data.<p>What is going to happen with his method is that points far away from 0 are going to weigh far less into your regression than points near 0. It&#x27;s not the same as doing a non-linear regression, which would assume that your data fits an exponential + normally distributed errors and constant variance. That would give all points equal weight.<p>[1] <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jL4JsLT5M6o/VEXCNmFesaI/AAAAAAAAD38/MT0bJSccnOk/s1600/exponential_data_with_trendline.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jL4JsLT5M6o/VEXCNmFesaI/AAAAAAAAD3...</a>",1413969199

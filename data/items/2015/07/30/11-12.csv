Fascism, like all ideologies isn&#x27;t completely neat.<p>It contains those reactionary conservative elements (organic community, national tradition, criticism of modernity as shallow - i.e. very Tolkein but found in many fascist and even Nazi authors - i.e. Junger, Schmitt) alongside hyper modernist ones (eugenics, mass industry). Fascism contains criticisms of capitalism alongside praise for the most aggressive market competition. See Ishay Landa&#x27;s work on this.<p>Proto-fascism is probably the best term.",1438257458

For instance:<p><pre><code>    def add_double(n):\n        x = n * 2\n        def add(y):\n            return x + y\n        return add\n    \n    f = add_double(1)\n    f(2) # -> 4\n</code></pre>\nWhat python versions prior to 3 didn&#x27;t support is rebinding a variable from an enclosing scope; not because of any fundamental feature of the implementation, but because there was no syntactic way to differentiate between a assigning to a variable in an enclosing scope, and creating a variable in the current scope. So x += 2 is short for x = x + 2, which python interprets as creating a new variable x in the current scope and then trying to access that variable before it&#x27;s been assigned.<p>Python 3 introduced a syntax to specify that you wanted to assign to a variable from an enclosing scope, the &#x27;nonlocal&#x27; keyword. So your example would be:<p><pre><code>    def even():\n      x = 0\n      def add():\n        nonlocal x\n        x += 2\n        return x\n      return add\n    count = even()\n    count()  # → 2\n    count()  # → 4</code></pre>",1438256251

It doesn&#x27;t have tail call elimination because Guido is under the, mistaken, impression that they inhibit backtraces. The zen of python spouts explicit is better than implicit as a marketing slogan to cover up a design wart with Python&#x27;s lolscope. It only had local and global scope. Python Scope is still broken[0] btw. But don&#x27;t worry, it is not a bug because it is documented. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻. The only reason Python passes as a language with good design is because people compare it to PHP or Javascript.<p>How is the numerical tower impractical? Having to check for overflow/underflow after every addition is what is impractical in my book.<p>> I am big fan of ... Common Lisp ... There is so much beauty and elegance.<p>Idk where to people get the idea that Common lisp is &#x27;beatiful and elegant&#x27; (in opposition to practical I may add). It is eminently practical. Have you seen loop and format (which btw Python has adopted with some glaring _practical_ omissions like list iteration ~{~}.)? The whole anything but nil is true to allow functions like digit-char-p to return a number instead of t is another practical design choice. Do you think there is anything elegant in modifying the readtable? I could go on and on. CL is a practical language that, apparently due to ESR&#x27;s nirvana bullshit quote, people who haven&#x27;t used it have a misconception about its design.<p>But back to the point, Scheme&#x27;s design (ideology if you want) is to play to pick features that synergize as to allow discard others as they can be expressed with the previous features/concepts. You don&#x27;t need iteration, as it is a special case of recursion. You need iterators, you have map, which is just a function the user can define, etc. And this is relevant to teaching computation as it allows the teacher to waste as little time teaching a language and allows him to focus on CONCEPTS. The amount of scheme knowledge needed to finish the SICP can be taught in 15 minutes (It doesn&#x27;t use macros). All the difficulty lies in the concepts it deals with. Getting the language out of the way allows to cover a lot of ground, for example in the SICP one implements a Virtual Machines and a compilers targeting it.<p>Now if you want to argue that nowadays the student needs to learn how to pipe software together and has less need for concepts that is another thing altogether[2], but saying that Python is practical (as opposed to ideological) and Scheme&#x27;s &#x27;ideological&#x27; choices hampers the students learning is bullshit.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://bugs.python.org/issue24321#msg244357"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.python.org/issue24321#msg244357</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/604088954816716800"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/604088954816716800</a><p>[2]: Of which I&#x27;d quote Dijkstra: &quot;It is the university responsibility to give society not what it wants but what it needs.&quot;",1438255371

In the second scenario there is clear intent to hurt an individual.  In the first scenario something like &quot;Library for retards&quot; is doing what exactly?  The retarded reader sees the word retarded, remembers that they are retarded, and then feels sad because they are in fact retarded?  Insulted by proxy.  It, unfortunately, clearly implies that being retarded is bad.  Lets be honest though.  How many people here would switch their current level of cognitive abilities for that of somebody who is mentally disabled?  Nobody.  It is a terrible state of human suffering (I would say).  But then again I am biased in thinking that life is &quot;better&quot; on the right end of most bell curves.<p>- If somebody is actively trying to hurt another person physically this needs to stop.  Full stop.<p>- If somebody is trying to emotionally hurt another person because of who they are that should stop.  So calling somebody retarded to their face?  Not a good thing.<p>- If somebody is trying to emotionally hurt another person by calling them names arbitrary names (&quot;you fag&quot; when the person is in fact hetero etc) is not a good thing.<p>The above are based on intent and are targeted towards a victim.<p>- If somebody tries to insult another persons beliefs or ideas?  Perfectly ok.  This, of course, isn&#x27;t what is happening in this case on github, but since this thread seems to be talking a bit about slippery slopes, I would rather not see our society fall so far at to make criticism a punishable &quot;offense&quot;.<p>At the end of the day changing one single word is just fine, but I wish it had happened in a more positive way rather than github using the heavy hand of their &quot;policy&quot; (an undefinable totally subjective ambiguity that isn&#x27;t applied uniformly to the whole site).<p>By the way, I am looking forward to the day when an &quot;offensive word&quot; registry is kept that bans language from use on the internet.  If a word is found to be offensive by 10,000 or more individuals anywhere in the world, we have to be sure to purge it from everyday usage (good luck keeping up with malicious grade school kids) /s  ...It is a stupid idea.<p>&quot;Sticks and stones will break my bones and words will most certainly kill me.&quot;  The new mantra.",1438254805

When I interviewed at IFTTT, they did their live coding exercise especially well. I never felt like I was being given an arbitrary pop quiz. It was a series of actual problems you might face on the job (a bunch of string replacement scenarios, if I remember correctly). The environment was more akin to pair programming with a remote co-worker than an interview. Instead of strictly evaluating and overlooking, my interviewer worked through the problem with me and even wrote part of the code. I didn&#x27;t make it past that first live coding exercise, either. They wanted someone with deep JS knowledge and mine didn&#x27;t go deep enough. They were honest and respectful, even when delivering a rejection. If I ever decided to move back to SF, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to interview with them again.<p><i>Sleep and balance was important to the team</i> ... <i>but we didn&#x27;t find a good way to surface it in the description.</i><p>That&#x27;s a tough one.

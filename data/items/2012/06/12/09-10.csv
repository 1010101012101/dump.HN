Selain ganas, penyembuhan kanker memerlukan waktu sangat lama karena menyerang bagian sel tubuh. Dalam arti, penyakit dalam seperti ini tidak bisa dilihat kasat mata. Salah satu penyakit kanker paling mematikan adalah penyakit kanker otak.\nKanker otak menyerang bagian saraf dan sel otak. Seperti kita sadari, otak adalah suatu elemen penting yang menjadi penggerak seluruh tubuh kita. Bila penyakit ini telah merasuk ke otak, pengobatannya sangat mahal dan waktu penyembuhannya pun tidak bisa diperkirakan secara jelas.\nUntuk pencegahan dini, ada beberapa langkah yang bisa kita perbuat sekadar menghindari penyakit mematikan ini.\n1. Jangan Terlalu Menekan Otak\nJangan biarkan otak ditekan dengan pikiran-pikiran yang membuat kita stres. Stres yang berkelanjutan akan berisiko kanker otak bertambah. Luangkan waktu untuk merefresh otak dari kesibukan yang mendera. Tidur yang teratur dapat menyegarkan kembali fungsi otak karena telah memberinya waktu istirahat yang cukup.\n2. Hindari Radiasi Langsung ke Alat Elektronik\nTelepon genggam bisa menyumbang penyakit kanker otak. Radiasi yang dihasilkan secara langsung akan membuat sel kanker tumbuh. Ketika kita menelepon lama, usahakan memakai headset. Ini akan mengurangi risiko kanker akibat radiasi langsung.\n3. Pola Makan\nPola makan sembarangan menjadi bumerang. Hindari makanan yang mengandung banyak lemak, seperti kebanyakan makan daging, atau sesuatu yang di goreng. Usahakan setiap hari mengkonsumsi buah-buahan dan sayuran. Gizi yang seimbang dan cukup akan membuat kita terhindar dari penyakit kanker otak.\n4. Hentikan Rokok dan Alkohol\nPenyumbang banyak penyakit ini selalu hadir dalam setiap kasus. Begitupun, kanker otak. Ia menyumbang nilai yang banyak karena racun yang dikandungnya. Penghentian rokok dan alkohol merupakan salah satu upaya menghindarkan kita dari berbagai macam penyakit selain kanker otak.\n5. Dilarang Mengonsumsi Obat Kimia Berlebihan\nMengonsumsi obat kimia berlebih, tanpa sepengetahuan atau izin dari dokter, harus kita hindari. Zat kimia yang terkandung dalam obat tersebut bisa membuat dan merangsang pertumbuhan sel kanker.\n6. Periksa Kesehatan dan Olah Raga\nMemeriksa kesehatan secara rutin akan membuat kita tahu bagaimana kondisi badan saat ini. Dengan demikian, akan lebih baik membuat penanganan karena sudah dideteksi sejak dini. Selain itu, olah raga teratur akan membuat kita tetap segar.\n7. Gaya Hidup Konsumtif\nJangan terbawa oleh gaya hidup yang terlalu instan, seperti gaya hidup malam, makanan cepat saji. Usahakan selalu membuat sesuatu sendiri supaya bisa menakar kebutuhan yang kita perlukan. Gaya hidup seperti ini bisa pula disejajarkan dengan hidup yang glamour.<p>Pengobatan Kanker Otak Alami Ace Maxs sangat baik karena kandungan yang terdapat dalam Ace Maxs Adalah ektrak kulit manggis dan daun sirsak yang mempunyai zat alami untuk pengobatan penyakit Kanker Otak.

If they wanted to charge separately for 3G or wifi delivery I'm sure they could do so: they have simply chosen not to.

EDIT: Maybe not actually.</i><p>I am also from Amsterdam and I am glad to see a startup from here. I feel like I should give my feedback: Other people have already mentioned that the landing page is a bit confusing. Too many things at once. I think the main thing is that making a good landing page takes a lot of time and effort plus iterations. There is also a lot of helpful material on Hacker News about this. Here is a good article about copywriting that might be useful for you: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3992500"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3992500</a> .<p>I have a comments on a few minor details:<p>1. I am not sensitive to swearing or anything, but I think you could have chosen a better title. To me I sounds a bit negative, like ""F*uck, I'm releasing. I'm done with this, I hate this project."". It would be better if it was positive ""Yeeesss, I am releasing"" or even better if it would make me curious as the reader what the project does, instead of focusing on yourself.<p>2. You need a logo. Don't be cheap about this. You spend 6 month of your time, so you can also spend couple 100 euros on a logo.<p>3. Vanilla Bootstrap is getting a bit old (to the HN crowd, not necessarily to normal people), I think you should at least change some colors.<p>4. Notifications and ""Access your content on any device"" tabs look broken because they don't have any content.<p>5. I think the visual flow of the landing page can be improved. The first thing I look at is the screenshot, and then I get confused because I try to understand what it does.<p>6. The login button looks misaligned.<p>7. Make the link to the tour more obvious.<p>8. Say that it is mobile compatible on your homepage, not just in the tour. Maybe even make an app out of it with PhoneGap if possible. (Mobile developers will murder me for this one)<p>9. ""Using Social Statistics to find important"", ""Listen Twitter, Facebook, Blogs."" are not proper sentences.

I don't use an RSS reader (the internet is enough distraction as it is already), so I can't compare and can't really say anything about it without using the product. I hope other people will comment on it.<p>I also have some questions for you:<p>1. Why did you incorporate in the Netherlands? I thought everyone incorporates as a British Limited these days. Also why did you incorporate as a BV and not VOF?<p>2. You have an office in Science Park Matrix ?! Are you already a profitable business?<p>3. Do you go to any start-up meetups in Amsterdam or anything like that?",1339491952

But here I go (with apologies):<p>Why are you trying to convince people to get on twitter? Twitter scratches an itch. An itch I have. An itch it would seem you have. But not an itch shared by everyone on the planet. If you had a friend who was complaining ""Gosh, I wish I could loosen this bolt without making my fingers all bloody,"" it would be appropriate to introduce him to wrenches. That doesn't mean you should be hounding him to use it to eat his cereal in the morning or brush his teeth at night.<p>If a person has a need for twitter, explain how twitter services that need. If he doesn't, well, he shouldn't be on twitter and no argument from you will change that.",1239811195

These people already have a seriously degraded internet experience, are they going to notice that the padding on your floats is all messed up?<p>I am pretty certain that you are leaving revenue on the table if you choose to ignore IE6 as a business, which is a valid objection to my argument. But how much?<p>And how much costs are you leaving <i>off</i> the table by freeing your designers and developers from supporting IE6, and allowing them to do other amazing things with their precious time?<p>Give me two almost-identical websites with two similar, business-oriented audiences, then have one site support IE6 and the other basically ignore it (and use the excess development/design time to build other features).

I own a pair of Sphere Halogens. I bought them since I felt at the end of the day(having stared at the screen for hours together, that I had eye-fatigue, related headaches and dryness.)

I would say it is totally worthwhile expenditure if you feel eye fatigue; obviously a whole lotta people seem to do good without them...so good for them.

They claim the future will see a 'polycentric' (see: multipolarity; they got the name wrong) world where we will be ruled by many powers instead of one.<p>Aside from the fact this has rarely been seen in history, and only during transitional periods (After WW2, briefly we had USA, USSR and the British Empire as superpowers) when it has been seen. When we look back, with hindsight it becomes clear that there is a direct line of superpowers back to the dawn of civilization and, largely, one superpower passed off the power to its successor. The example here would be that the British Empire, instead of fighting to the death stepped aside for the USA. This has been played for thousands of years, during the Classical period it was passed between Greece and Rome, who was the super power. After the Roman Empire was defeated by the Hunnic Empire (Atilla the Hun) the power moved so far to the east no one in Europe had a clue, which led to the Dark Ages, because the people who had spread their technology (the Romans) rarely taught the locals how to build it themselves.<p>This meant that after the Roman Empire, and the fairly swift collapse of the Hunnic Empire with the death of Atilla, Europe was left without a power and so was the world. It was quite ironic, it would be like if the USSR had beat the USA in 1990, and a year later still collapsed. The effect was profound, especially moving into the medieval period, due to the fact that people relied on these Empires to shift around technology and without them there was no one big enough to move the information.<p>(Ed: This is also why when moving into the late Medieval Period and the Colonial Era, we had multiple powers all handing the superpower status between them as one got a clear advantage. In hindsight this largely centered between England and France, a play reminiscent of how Greece and Rome passed the superpower title between themselves many times during the classical period, but at no point was there two true superpowers.)<p>I find that their predictions are based on personal opinions, and they choose to use history to back themselves up whenever it's convenient, but in many of the examples they wholly ignore it. There's no historical basis to assume suicide bombings, it's an exceptionally rare development with the invention of compact explosives and religious brainwashing. Why would a pirate perform a suicide bombing, it's absurd they're in it for personal gain not religious gain.<p>This article is very stupid merely for trying to predict the future.

Not necessarily deep philosophical topics. But something the individual is keenly interested and/or passionate about.

I learned that one of the best ways to become a better soccer dribbler (foot skills) is to practice kicking a ball in the surf on the beach (because you have the water resistance to deal with). He also said that the reason why Americans aren't good at soccer (football) among other reasons is - Americans have perfect playing fields, while Brazilians, they grow up kicking stuff in the dirt, sand so the groomed soccer field is easy compared to the rough + tumble environment they learned on. I love learning about the 'hacks' (to become better faster).",1239808573

I thought it was that the 21 day incubation period is something like the 95th percentile, and the 42 day period is the 98-99th percentile.<p>From the article: &quot;The 42-day period is twice the generally accepted maximum incubation period of the virus. However, some incubation periods are longer - that WHO said that in 95 percent of cases the incubation period was between one and 21 days. In 98 percent it was no longer than 42 days.&quot;",1413439184

So the news of Nexus 6 was exciting but it still seems bit behind on hardware front:<p>* No 128GB memory option. This is absolutely important for me and it seems Apple is the only one of few company who gets this. I started running out of 64 GB long time ago.<p>* No TouchID equivalent which is excellent and works flowlessly on iPhones.<p>* No slow-mo videos at 200+ frames per second.<p>* From hardware perspective N6 still stuck in 32-bit world. Plus it lacks motion processor that monitors my movements and fitness data all the time without draining batteries.<p>* 8MP camera is actually better than 12MP and gives better low light performance. Higher MP is actually deal breaking for me (if sensor size remains same).<p>* At 10mm thickness, that&#x27;s actually going backwards from 7mm for iPhone 6.

8463568,comment,8461667,8463266,0,0,konklone,,,"> The post is nothing more than an attempt to shame Quora into opening up their data.<p>My post is definitely an attempt to shame Quora into opening up their data, in at least the sense of making it available to the Internet Archive. No bones there.<p>> There are many people that don&#x27;t want everything they post on the internet going into permanent and searchable databases.<p>We may just disagree to some extent on what the norms should be, but I think if you&#x27;re intentionally posting public content to a public website, that&#x27;s part of the permanent public record. <i>Especially</i> when that website is about accumulating a knowledge base.<p>Wikipedia, another knowledge base, records everything. Though unlike Quora, you&#x27;re allowed to contribute fully anonymously (without even registering an account -- in fact, come in through Tor, if you like). They have no problem allowing themselves to be backed up on the Archive, and I&#x27;d be pretty worried if they did.<p>In fact, Wikipedia&#x27;s robots.txt is really interesting: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt</a><p>There&#x27;s some brief bot exclusions, a brief, now commented-out section asking the Internet Archive not to archive user pages, and then a very, very long section blocking various pages from being indexed by anyone. That long section has a lot of thought and history in it, including notes about the Internet&#x27;s memory about users, like &quot;Folks get annoyed when XfD discussions end up the number 1 google hit for their name.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s totally fair to argue with Wikipedia about the choices it makes in its robots.txt, but ultimately what we&#x27;re talking about here are <i>organizations</i> making these choices on behalf of users, not the individual users themselves.<p>If individuals are concerned about their contributions being preserved, that should be something they take up with the Archive. The Archive respects take down requests, both because copyright is a thing and because they&#x27;re not interested in harming individuals.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re working in the service of humanity by blessing companies that gate the future&#x27;s access to massive troves of knowledge that was freely contributed to public websites.",1413438783

8463558,comment,8461304,8461304,0,0,robomartin,,,"As it pertains to what&#x27;s going on in the US, there is a question nobody in the media is asking and frankly, I don&#x27;t understand why.  It&#x27;s very simple:<p>What have you been doing since 9/11?<p>Context:<p>It was fair to assume, after 9/11 that some kind of a bio or chemical attack could have been in the cards for the future.  Such weapons had been used in the Middle East.<p>As various agencies were realigned in order to deal with the new threats and Homeland Security was created it only stands to reason that some of the objectives had to be to engineer, plan, drill and prepare for quick and effective response to a wide range of potential attacks.<p>I am not a biologist or chemist nor do I have any real experience or knowledge dealing with these kinds of attack scenarios.<p>This is going to sound really weird, but, well, I have three large German Shepherd Dogs and I&#x27;ve had cases of all three coming down with diarrhea.  Having to clean up such a mess teaches you a thing or two about the spread and handling of bodily fluids.<p>After experiencing that just once I put into place a system and a kit to be able to deal with the situation more effectively.  It&#x27;s nasty and I really didn&#x27;t want to suffer like I did the first time. I am happy to say that my planning worked well.<p>Now, using that example, had I been involved with DHS and CDC back in 9/11 I would have devoted serious time and resources to creating and equipping rapid response teams to deal with chemical and bio attacks in all major cities.<p>I would have designed and tested container-based (as in converted cargo containers) emergency response systems.  I would have developed a set of isolation environments within containers.  I would have staged these in every major city in the country at appropriate locations.  And, of course, I would have conducted quarterly drills in order to ensure that everyone who might potentially have to be involved in dealing with a chemical or bio attack was trained to the best of our abilities.<p>I probably would have included both civilian and military personnel in this system.<p>All that would be missing would be that music that plays in the Transformers movies when the trucks, planes and ships deploy to do battle.  In other words, I would require a system that was that ready to go into action.  Just like the movies.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve watched every CDC conference surrounding this Ebola business.  It&#x27;s embarrassing.  It&#x27;s scary.  It is absolutely astounding to me that no reporter is asking this simple question:  What have you been doing since 9/11?  And I say so because the story coming out of the CDC sure sounds like, well, amateur hour is too harsh, but let&#x27;s just say it is obvious they were not ready for this.<p>When you have the director of the CDC on camera saying things like &quot;We now have two teams supervising operations at the hospital so we can make improvements&quot;.  In other words, one team wasn&#x27;t enough, you guys didn&#x27;t have your act together, you have left the response to these kinds of incidents to the random training, equipment and judgement of any random hospital in the US (because there was no way to know where the index patient might land, right?).  Why weren&#x27;t these drills, supervised by not one, but five teams of observers and experts conducted five or ten years ago.  Why now?  Why do you have to figure it out now?<p>To say that it is obvious that these people have squandered 13 years is a grotesque understatement.  What would happen if we had twenty patients arrive into twenty different cities?  Was there a plan?  Is there a plan?  No. Of course not.<p>I am trying like hell to not get political here.  But, you know, every corner we turn we see example after example of just how bad big government can be.  They can&#x27;t manage building a website that a team of five college dropouts could have aced in six months.  And we trust them to protect us from bio hazards?  What have they been doing during the last thirteen years?  If they are not incompetent, what are they?<p>Here&#x27;s reality, going back to my dog example.  I take a nice large building and spray the interior with liquefied dog shit.  I then take a group of engineers and task them with cleaning said building.  They have all the tools they need to develop protective gear, tools, equipment and procedures to do it quickly, safely and thoroughly.  And they are also tasked with developing these systems and procedures such that we could easily containerize them and scale them to be able to instantly deal with liquefied dog-shit attacks anywhere in the US.<p>How long do you think it would take to have an absolutely amazing system in place if we took that away from government and held a contest open to any and all private entrepreneurs?  Each of 100 teams gets a ten million dollar grant from the US government.  The winning team walks away with a contract and a $100 million dollar prize.  A year?  At the most? I would think so. The CDC and DHS have had 13 years to accomplish exactly this and prepare for the potential of a massive chemical or biological attack in the US and the best they can do is what we are seeing now?  With sick nurses getting on planes?  And television anchors breaking quarantine?  And &quot;breaches of protocol&quot;?  What protocol?<p>Unbelievable.  In my world this isn&#x27;t about firing someone it goes way beyond that.  This is criminal.  This isn&#x27;t even political as it spans administrations controlled by both major political parties.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I happen to think that this is reasonably unlikely to fully derail here in the US.  Not because the CDC and DHS have it together.  Nope.  Simply because Ebola doesn&#x27;t is hard to transmit and we don&#x27;t have a ten, twenty or a hundred cases spread all over the place.  We had ONE guy that got through.  And that was enough to expose just how fucked the response system happens to be. I really hope nobody else dies.<p>It might get a little scarier before it gets better, but I think we will be OK.  What&#x27;s got me rattled is that we are watching our response system engage in real time experiments with people&#x27;s lives in front of the entire world when the fundamental procedural aspects having to do with responding to something like this should have been fully worked out, tested, verified, re-tested and forward deployed years ago.  Not now.  Years ago.  Dealing with fighting a specific virus is a different story, that&#x27;s biology, that&#x27;s not procedure and readiness in terms of forward deployment of resources to deal with containment, etc.<p>Again, simple question:<p>What have they been doing since 9/11?<p>Are we ever going to hold any of these people accountable?<p>Why doesn&#x27;t anyone ask the right questions?",1413438526

8463517,comment,8458339,8460376,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"There are a variety of more-or-less sort-of correct answers below, but I&#x27;ll throw in my two cents regardless. I am a nuclear physicist who spent a lot of time worrying about neutrons, which are a major source of backgrounds in neutrino detectors.<p>Two points made reply to you are correct: neutrons are radiation, but not electromagnetic radiation; and neutrons can make other things radioactive.<p>Some thing other people are saying are less correct: any individual neutron will deposit most of its energy in one place, but averaging over many neutrons their energy deposition will be spread out. Furthermore, neutrons will come out in all directions. The problem of neutron damage is not small, but no one seriously believes it&#x27;s a show-stopper.<p>Neutrons are the exploding billiard-balls of nuclear physics. Fusion produces &quot;fast&quot; neutrons, with moderate energies. This is a deuterium-deuterium device, so most of the neutrons will come out with 2.4 MeV, which happens to be the same as fission neutrons. The DD reaction produces tritium as a byproduct about half the time, though, and DT fusion will lead to 14 MeV neutrons. There will be fewer of these in most designs, and some designs incorporate ideas to get rid of the tritium quickly to suppress these higher energy neutrons.<p>At high energies neutrons don&#x27;t tend to interact very much with light nuclei, and for a variety of reasons fusion reactor design is dominated by light nuclei. What they do do is bounce off, which is where the billiard-ball analogy comes in. Each time a neutron bounces off another nucleus it loses energy (because the nucleus it bounces off of recoils, carrying some energy with it.) This is just pure Newtonian mechanics.<p>Neutrons typically travel a few metres in the process of slowing down, depending on the material. Light materials slow them down faster: a light ball bouncing off a heavy ball doesn&#x27;t loss much energy, but bouncing off another light ball it does (hydrogen is the best material for slowing neutrons down because of this, and hydrogen-rich materials like water are good too.)<p>The neutron never completely stops because the nuclei it is bouncing off of are in thermal motion. At room temperature a neutron in thermal equilibrium moves at about 2200 m/s. But not for very long, because this is where the exploding comes in.<p>You can think of it in these terms: once thermalized, a neutron is passing by other nuclei rather slowly (2200 m/s is slow when you&#x27;re a neutron). This gives it lots of time to react with nuclei, rather than just bouncing off, and eventually it does. When a nucleus absorbs a neutron it becomes a different isotope of the same element, and in many cases adding a neutron to a stable isotope makes it radioactive. Carbon-12 is a stable isotope that, with the addition of a neutron becomes carbon-13, and if it happens to get another neutron added later on, radioactive carbon-14.<p>Neutrons are a pain, even to fission engineers, and fission depends absolutely on them to happen. They get everywhere, are hard to shield, make stuff radioactive and damage materials. But we know pretty much how to deal with them, and it&#x27;s unlikely they will make the difference between working and not working in a device like this.",1413437662

When blacked out I can still walk though. The second time I walked straight into a pole, according to my friends, though my memory stops a good 20 feet away from the pole, just after saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s happening again,&quot; and starting to laugh even though I was terrified. I have a brief memory of standing in front of pole, then nothing again until a good ten minutes later, in front of a water fountain in the school office (which is where my friends steered me).<p>When it first happened I literally thought I was losing my mind, due to stress or a tumor or something. When the doctor calmly said, actually that just sounds like low blood sugar, let&#x27;s schedule a glucose tolerance test, it was a huge relief.

Not all human exchange that leads to the benefits of market forces needs to be done through currency and its near analogues.  Democracy and Government operate under its own types of markets and mediums of exchange.  People still act for their own best interests under those systems.

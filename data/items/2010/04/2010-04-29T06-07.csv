We're talking about a major (yes, major) decision here.<p>And the logic... drop out of college because a handful of very smart entrepreneurs were able to start successful businesses without their degree?  Come on.  Let's count the successful college graduates who have made it big AND the college drop-outs who have tried and failed (and double count the ones that never went back; yikes, hard to count).  Or let's make it conditional, ""if you know you're of Bill Gates' stature and timing is of the essence, sure, drop out.  If not, get the piece of paper you've already put time and money towards (and have fun!).  Then start your business.""<p>But at least they're putting their money where their mouth is via investments.  I'd be curious, though, whether the drop-outs they're funding are recent drop-outs, or whether the founders cut their teeth elsewhere before starting their current venture.  If the latter, the advice perhaps becomes, ""drop out of college to get a job at a start-up and maybe start your own business later.""  Which leads us to the obliging question to Fred and Caterina (and everyone else in tech) - how many young non-grads have they hired recently in their own companies or portfolio companies.",1272523104

1303751,comment,1303609,1303609,0,0,dfield,,,"This topic comes up on HN every few months and never fails to create a lively debate.  As a (potential) future entrepreneur / freshman in college, 
I've gone back and forth a few times about whether I should continue my education.  Here are the conclusions I've made:<p>(FYI - I'm probably just reiterating what others have said, but I'm lazy and don't want to properly cite by finding all the ""should you go to college"" blog posts / comments...)<p>0.  Staying in school doesn't hurt.  College is a four year block of time where you are encouraged and expected to experiment with every aspect of your life.  This experimental space can't be found anywhere else.  (The financial aspect is a different story; if going to college puts you in a huge amount of debt, this point may not be true.)<p>1.  Know that you can always dropout.  I take comfort in this fact.  If I come across a life-changing opportunity, I can always just postpone college.<p>2.  Theory != Practice.  When I first started studying CS at school, I was peeved that professors didn't optimize code as much as possible.  Why should I disregard the constant for a linear time algorithm?  However, I've since come to appreciate the generality of this method of thinking.  Thinking generally about specific problems is (to me, at least) a valuable skill to have and one that I need to work on.<p>3.  It's not about the classes, it's about the people.  This is an old but important argument and it's completely valid.  You'll learn way more from your classmates than you will from your professors.  It doesn't matter how great of a coder you are... if you don't learn social skills you'll be a terrible entrepreneur.<p>4.  Professors are really smart.  At any decent university, you'll have access to a group of people who have spent their entire careers being clever.  Most are more than happy to explain their work / mentor an interested student / try to impart some cleverness.<p>5.  A three-month summer.  The fact that summers are exactly three-months is a good thing.  If they were longer, students might not return from really wonderful jobs.  If they were shorter, students wouldn't be exposed to jobs long enough.  By taking full advantage of summers, you can ""job hop"" and sample careers / businesses in a way that would be otherwise frowned upon.  I've learned a lot about how I would create company culture by working at different companies, and I still have three more summers to keep learning.<p>6.  Keeping relevant paths open.  Entrepreneurship has always sounded attractive to me, but I'm curious about a lot of things.  I'd rather be positive about the career path I choose than always wonder if I should have done something else with my life.  By trying out research / acting / underwater basket weaving now, I can either decide certain professions aren't for me or find a way to incorporate them into my eventual line of work.<p>7.  Recruitment.  From a purely economic, slightly perverse perspective, college is a great place to recruit for a future startup.",1272522599

So if/when it comes time for me to do that, I will probably have to grow up and get a Real Job.<p>Until that point though, this is great!

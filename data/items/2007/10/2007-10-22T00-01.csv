The same applies to tech blogging.  Is Scoble blogging for money or making money off blogging?

Can you imagine such a person? ...""</i><p>Also laughed at this one. But not for the reason you might think. The engineering guys are google are smart right? I think the reason why some take up the <i>""evangelism hat""</i> is out of sheer necessity. Google has what 15,000 employees. I'm not sure of the numbers for those at the sharp end. With this number of smart people working on their own projects. Fierce competition for recognition would be required to get your project above the noise of others all competing for a place in the google platform, process and dollars.<p>Therefore it's not unreasonable to expect someone figured out it might be a good idea to market or spruik. Anything to let those above, beside or below consider that my process, product or idea is better than the next.  In startups this process is essential and is turned into a real art form by the likes of Winer, Spolsky and Graham who write, blog and speak where required ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=70863"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=70863</a>",1193012835

70996,comment,70939,70979,0,0,idea,,,"Windows Server licenses through an ISV program are not that expensive. Obviously Microsoft knows Linux is a big competitor. More costly are other server licenses like SQL Server and Exchange.<p>One reason to use Windows could be because you like .NET, Silverlight, etc. Another reason would be because you know Windows well. If you develop on Windows it may be easier to also test and deploy on Windows and administer the servers. It is easy to set up an Ubuntu server in a few hours and use apt-get for updates, but an internet facing server will probably not be very secure if you or a coworker does not have a few years of Linux experience.<p>In the end an OS is just a tool. I would say pick the one you are most experienced with or the one on which your chosen techology works best.",1193011468

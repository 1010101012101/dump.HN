No matter what your situation (wife, kids, intern, job, etc) you need to compromise time on some things to make time for others. And depending on your situation it will involve compromise from other people in your life as well like friends,social life,wife,kids.<p>While most commenters here are right about schedules, That can be hard for some people. What I find is most important is communication with your stakeholders (i.e. wife/gf/kids) and maybe not setting an entire schedule for your whole day , but maybe a set time block a few days a week for ""pet project work"". What is really important here is do the same for your other responsibilities. Like Tuesday nights is ""watch TV with the wife and kids"" night and wednesday night is ""I work on my project"" night.<p>Most important to remember is Keep Trying!",1350921523

I'm married, have one child, play hockey 1.5 times a week, write and record music, and try to cook. When I have a pet project in mind, all of that gets put on hold. I have to _make_ time and shove some things aside.<p>There are boundaries though. I don't hide in a hole away from my wife and daughter for a weekend. It goes in chunks of time. Family is a priority for me, and I can't justify shutting them out so I can code for a weekend. As a result, I need to work in 1-4 hour chunks. Four hours is pushing it (either because of sleep or a daughter craving time with me on a saturday).  Hockey, music, cooking...  those things can always wait when I choose.<p>I also constrain myself to small pet projects. Many times the projects cannot be completed, and I'm ok with that. I usually work on projects to prove out ideas or learn something... not finish them. Sometimes I share stuff on my blog or github. However, my work is usually rough around the edges. My pet projects are not meant to be polished and beautiful. They are for me to learn or just do something crazy and cool.<p>Having a child will cut off your free time like a tourniquet. However, I've found that having a child has also helped me focus. My seven years as a father have arguably (and ironically) been my most productive for my career. I have a hard time explaining that, other than I've had to focus and really come to terms with what is important - both at the macro level of choosing an activity and at the micro level of how pretty I want my side-work to be.",1350921411

And the first kid is on the way.<p>I have all the time I need.<p>I'm not a fastidious planner with a Type-A personality and an obsession with maintaining lists.  I'm actually terribly lazy and my wife might have to remind me a couple times to get something done before I actually find time to do it.  I think I've just structured my life around what I love to do that it all falls into place with the least amount of effort on my part.<p>Things that contribute to me having enough free time to work on my side projects:<p>- I don't spend much time watching TV, playing video games, or engaging in passive activities (I save them for when I need a rest)
 - I live close to where I work so that I don't waste hours commuting
 - I keep my circle of friends small and plan my social engagements ahead of time (I usually plan them around the time I want for working on my projects)
 - I do chores, run errands, and keep up with all the little things using a todo list. If I need to pick up groceries I'll do it on the commute home. If I need to run a bunch of errands I'll schedule that time in advance.
 - I get up early and get my exercise in before I start my work day
 - I never work at my full time job for more than 8 hours (very few extraneous circumstances will change that. I break this rule on occassion)
 - Wife and I are rather independent people and we like our personal time which helps too ;)<p>Time is the one resource that we cannot acquire more of.  We're all spending at the same rate as one another.  I believe it's how you choose to spend it that is the most important.  I tend to be very self-centered and introverted and structure my life around spending as much time on the things that will make me happy as I possibly can.

4683628,comment,4680865,4682099,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Perhaps, allow me to offer a counter argument. I claim that if the only criteria a voter uses in voting is ""I like how your part of the government is working"", vote the incumbent. If they don't like how its going, vote someone else. Very simple, no research, no time wasted at all. And absolutely effective.<p>The reason its effective is because elections in the US are very bias sensitive, the very small margins of victory for one candidate or another means that a small change in voter sympathy can change the outcome of the election. Further, by creating a selection criteria of 'like' / 'don't like' in the voter input, you set up a genetic algorithm for evolving government.<p>There a probably a couple of dozen 'evolution simulators' available on the web. They all work in the same way, they take a population of organisms, they exist for a while in an environment, and then they 'reproduce' with a selection bias. Over a few generations the selection bias results in a population that demonstrates the characteristic that the selection bias is targeted toward. The basic mechanism is that organisms that align with the selection bias 'win' (and thus reproduce) and those that don't align 'die.'<p>That algorithm doesn't care what the 'lifeform' is, and it always works. That is part of the reason it annoys folks who favor an intelligent design theory of evolution.<p>Elections are the 'reproduction' cycle of politicians. Their 'survival' depends on them managing the bias in their favor which they have a limited amount of power to do. If the current non-voting block of citizens jumped into the game and voted 'like'/'do not like' it would force government to 'evolve' a set of politicians that were doing a good job <i>as defined by the people who vote.</i><p>Clearly this doesn't work when the government is rigging the elections (as Russia was accused of doing to counter unexpected voter turnout) but it certainly does in a fair election.",1350920532

I used to work in a call centre for a large company which had all manor of silly policies.<p>Since we were on the ""front line"" we were usually the ones informing the customers of these policies. We were usually given very limited information about the hows/whys of these policies so when the customers started getting annoyed and asking questions all we could reply with was ""I don't know, that is just our policy"" and ""I don't have the authority to do that"".<p>Looking back on it I'm guessing we were kept in the dark on purpose since after a couple of minutes about 90% of the customers would just give up and accept it. Some asked to speak to a manager but of course we were instructed never to put a manager on the line and always to claim that the manager was unavailable or to just transfer the call to another agent who would give the same answer.<p>If they had given us more information about these policies then we would have ended up spending hours in discussion with the customer which is of course what the call centre managers specifically <i>didn't</i> want.",1350920365

The insurance companies, faced with rising costs, can either impose more restrictive rules about what they will or will not cover, or they can hike their premiums.<p>In the former case, theyre doing the same thing that a government agency would do, except that people generally change insurers when they change jobs... meaning that any care that costs money up front but would prevent problems five or ten years down the line is not worth spending money on, because some other insurance company would be picking up the savings.<p>In the latter case, middle- and upper-class families see more of their paycheck going to insurance, while people who cant afford the premiums but arent poor enough for Medicaid just go without insurance, depend on the emergency room if they really really need something, and risk getting bankrupted by medical bills if a serious condition does appear.<p>(Which is why Obamacare was passed in the first place.)",1350919359

Making a good OS is itself a difficult task. Making a good OS & getting an application market to grow around it in a deal-breaker rich environment is nearly impossible. There were no ways to climb the hill other than straight up the steep face.<p>Smartphones/tablets are an angle of attack. An easier way to climb the hill. Android & iOS matured without having to compete with windows. Now two of MS's most dangerous competitors can both launch new smartphone derived PC (keyboard & mouse) operating systems with 80% of the work (in both OS building & in app ecosystem building) already done.<p>Even worse, there may be room for new mobile OS' to get going. The market isn't tending to the same kind of monopoly as PCs.<p>I predict that iOS, Android and/or yet-to-succeed OSs are going to hop from tablets & phones to TVs and other devices. Its only a matter of time before we see one gaining traction on laptops. Apple could probably release a $500 post-PC PC within a year that will double (in units) Apple sales out of the gate. Google could too (though it probably wouldn't hit the ground running as fast).<p>Eventually, this market will fold in on itself and we will have several OS families. I would be surprised if any one (including windows) gets as firm a grip on any market as microsoft did.<p>This doesn't mean that MS dies. They are (despite the criticisms) a very competent company.

The real question is, why does Fog Creek think it is to its advantage to only hire potlatch participants, when such discrimination is usually irrational as well as unethical?<p>The answer, I think, is because they are in the unique position of being able to get away with it. In the normal course of events you&#x27;ll do worse looking for candidates from Ivy League universities than from people who haven&#x27;t gone to college because you&#x27;re fishing in a pool that has already been thoroughly fished by your competitors. But \nFog Creek frankly doesn&#x27;t have very many competitors in this regard, at least not ones remotely in the same league. They seem to be so much better at hiring interns than almost anyone else (in the sense of having a strong brand name to attract attention in the first place, a rigorous selection process and generous offers to those selected) that they will probably be able to pick the cream of the crop no matter where they look, so they have no need to look further afield.<p>So I think it&#x27;s a case where the number one player can get away with something the rest of us couldn&#x27;t.",1396907974

I wish you had asked for our side of the story before publishing these allegations.<p>I agree that flat rates should be compared to flat rates.  It would indeed be misleading to compare Zidisha&#x27;s flat interest rates with another microfinance provider&#x27;s APR rates.<p>In my experience, flat interest and fee rates of over 30% are common in microfinance, and that was the basis for the comparisons I have made with the cost of Zidisha loans.  It is hard to find reliable data on the average APR of microloans worldwide, because many microfinance organizations underreport the full cost of their loans, and those that do opt for full disclosure on sites such as Microfinance Transparency and the MIX Market tend to be those with the lowest rates.<p>This article provides a good overview of some of the complications involved in measuring the cost of traditional microfinance loans: <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2010/04/02/microfinance-interest-rates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.givewell.org/2010/04/02/microfinance-interest-ra...</a>",1396907952

You get so burnt out on your current job that you start to treat every job interview as a potential relief from this burden in your life. What happens though is that you start to sound desperate when interviewing. No one wants to hire a desperate person. Even if you are the most qualified candidate, if you give off the wrong vibe it is difficult to get hired.<p>My advice is to stop focusing on the outcome of interviews and just focus on what you can control in the process. Try to do a few things each week that will make you seem like a better candidate than you were last week. Treat it like a game where you are leveling up during each round. Go back and review interview questions that you didn&#x27;t answer well and rehearse what you would say the next time. Put together some material that you can show to someone interviewing you that helps guide the conversation towards your strong points. Keep an open mind and talk to people in your industry. Making it trough several rounds with Google means you are a strong candidate. If you keep up with the process, you&#x27;ll start getting job offers.",1396907707

We need to code our own STS-like dialup chat board because we&#x27;re not paying for a license. 25 of us would work on that until 6:00am the next morning and it&#x27;d be done even with the craziest of distractions going on, such as around 11pm a steady stream of local misfits would come in as we&#x27;d converted it into an all ages boozecan and defacto nightclub with a stupid amount of lights rigged up that were in hindsight absolutely frightening considering the terribad wiring job we hacked together. It looked like the video from Front242 - Operating Tracks but with more eye searing strobe lights.<p>Now the hacker space I go to is largely populated with professional developers and students so gone is the raging music, the drugs, the anarchy/activism, the close-knit community, the epic amount of crime and nobody knows each other. There&#x27;s less women too, in the 90s I would say it was half and half with many girls actively participating. I can count on one hand the amount of female hackers I&#x27;ve seen at the new space. Even though our old space was drug fueled insanity more work seemed to get done. No group projects going on anymore, there&#x27;s a few but it&#x27;s usually something like making your bike glow in the dark and not hacking software just for the sake of hacking. Doesn&#x27;t help that none of us have any spare time either, we are all too busy in careers/school to afford an all nighter hack session like back in the day. Barely any of us can even manage to coordinate a time when everybody can be in the same room for 5 mins for a meeting let alone work on any projects.",1396907442

7549793,comment,7548232,7549377,2,0,dllthomas,,,"First, there is no straw man here.  A straw man is a misrepresentation of your position, which I then argue against.  What I was constructing was a counterexample that fit what you&#x27;d laid out but that I assumed (correctly) that you <i>did not</i> agree with.  It&#x27;s a proof by counterexample of the completeness of your framework.<p>Second, you deny that there is anything incomplete about your framework, and then you pull in hate speech - which 1) it was by no means clear that you had intended to include (adding &quot;unless hate speech&quot; seems to me a materially different position than without it, and real people probably hold both versions), and 2) it is not entirely clear that Prop 8 shouldn&#x27;t be considered an example of hate speech (though context being what it was, it is <i>entirely</i> clear that we shouldn&#x27;t be prosecuting people retroactively for it).<p><i>&quot;There is no societal problem with propositions which are constitutionally untenable.&quot;</i><p>There is no inherent societal problem <i>by virtue of</i> a proposition <i>being</i> constitutionally untenable.  Many constitutionally untenable actions entail a tremendous societal problem, though - consider the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII.  Many would consider temporarily depriving a class of people of rights they&#x27;d previously been afforded &quot;a societal problem&quot;.  In many cases, I think they&#x27;re clearly correct.  Here, I think they&#x27;re correct but somewhat less clearly (partly due to proximity).<p><i>&#x27;No, there was a problem with your straw man. Remove that, and you&#x27;ll find that your position reduces to, &quot;Society should not tolerate speech from people who are wrong.&quot;  The problem is how such a thing would be adjudicated.<p>There&#x27;s a problem with your framework.  You don&#x27;t see the solution because your position is effectively against free speech. You are only for speech you personally label as &quot;tolerant.&quot; In a truly free society, one must be free to be wrong. That&#x27;s the only way it can work.&#x27;</i><p>First, it should be clearly noted that no one is calling for criminal penalties.  These things are adjudicated by individuals deciding who they are and are not comfortable dealing with.<p>Second, I didn&#x27;t propose a framework.  You&#x27;d made an assertion, and I was trying to get at the lines you were drawing around that assertion.<p>Third, in a free society, you deal with the consequences of your actions - including speech.  It&#x27;s worth noting that this is why capabilities for anonymous speech are so important.  There are some consequences we should clearly be going out of our way to preclude; governmental retribution is antithetical to free speech, violence needs to be prevented, &c.  But &quot;I said something people don&#x27;t like, therefore they don&#x27;t like me as much, therefore they prefer to do business with someone else&quot; is an entirely unavoidable consequence of a free society - the alternative is to force people to do business they don&#x27;t want to do.<p>Finally, again, there was no straw-man, and <i>granting</i> that introducing the notion of hate speech solves the issue (of which I&#x27;m skeptical) there <i>was</i> a flaw in the framework you&#x27;d laid out: the lack of mention of hate speech as an exception.",1396907314

Is this established at the beginning or can more coins be minted along the way?<p>A: The default is an app starts with 0 coins but this can be adjusted. Currently an app&#x27;s coins are inflationary with no cap. Which means as new work is done, new coins are minted. Because a real product and its growth backs each coin, it doesn&#x27;t appear to make sense to create scarcity.<p>Q: How is this enforced? Is it distributed? Does it exist on the blockchain in some way?<p>A: Today its tracked in Assembly for each app in a ledger thats downloadable by anyone (see assemblymade.com/helpful/log.csv as an example of one product&#x27;s log). We think future blockchain technology is promising.<p>Q: Is there a market for AppCoins? Are they tradable? Or are they only dispensed by the project creator?<p>A: Each app has its own core team (like in OSS). They are responsible for setting vision, quality standards, and ultimately accepting which work makes it into the product and mints new coins. There&#x27;s no market yet. Trading App Coins opens up some thorny legal issues that we&#x27;re working through.<p>Q: Is the revenue share enforced in some way? Legally? Programmatically?<p>A: Legally through our binding TOS and programmatically; we publish all of each app&#x27;s revenue and expenses so that anybody can verify the integrity of the payout.",1396907306

I do like the comments about finding the unique characteristics because every instrument has a personality.<p>Conventional wisdom in classical guitars <i>ALSO</i> says the guitars have a lifetime.  The wood is tight, then it opens up, and then it breaks down gradually over time--roughly 15-20 years for cedar tops and 40 years for spruce tops.<p>If that is actually true, I suspect that feeds into this study.  The Stradivaris, while phenomenal, are long past their peak and are now at the point where they are breaking down from playing and are likely only being preserved by the rarity with which they are being played.<p>I wonder if the &quot;moderns&quot; used in the study actually had some mileage on them.

Many of my fellow students are turned off by the bigger companies since they feel like they won&#x27;t be able to make an impact. As a smaller company, this is your ace in the hole. Use it to your advantage.<p>* Personally, exploding offers leave a bad taste in my mouth. Everyone knows how long the recruitment process takes, and you should give the intern the common courtesy to make an informed decision. The last thing you want is a disgruntled intern on your payroll for a few months.<p>* You should consider internships as an investment. Build a relationship with your intern, and it will pay numerous dividends in the long run. They might return for a full-time position or they may refer a friend that they respect.  A good way to support your intern during the school year is to sponsor a hackathon or an interview workshop at their school. This gets you face-to-face with some of the most motivated hackers at any school, where you can begin the courting process.<p>Just some quick thoughts from the student&#x27;s side of the table.",1396905937

Mobile is the future. What wins mobile, wins the Internet. Right now, apps are winning and the web is losing.<p>Moreover, there are signs that it will only get worse. Ask any web company and they will tell you that they value app users more than web users. This is why you see so many popups and banners on mobile websites that try to get you to download apps. It is also why so many mobile websites are broken. Resources are going to app development over web development. As the mobile web UX further deteriorates, the momentum toward apps will only increase.<p>The likely end state is the web becomes a niche product used for things like 1) trying a service before you download the app, 2) consuming long tail content (e.g. link to a niche blog from Twitter or Facebook feed).<p>This will hurt long-term innovation from a number of reasons:<p>1) Apps have a rich-get-richer dynamic that favors the status quo over new innovations. Popular apps get home screen placement, get used more, get ranked higher in app stores, make more money, can pay more for distribution, etc. The end state will probably be like cable TV – a few dominant channels/apps that sit on users’ home screens and everything else relegated to lower tiers or irrelevance.<p>2) Apps are heavily controlled by the dominant app stores owners, Apple and Google. Google and Apple control what apps are allowed to exist, how apps are built, what apps get promoted, and charge a 30% tax on revenues.<p>Most worrisome: they reject entire classes of apps without stated reasons or allowing for recourse (e.g. Apple has rejected all apps related to Bitcoin). The open architecture of the web led to an incredible era of experimentation. Many startups are controversial when they are first founded.  What if AOL or some other central gatekeeper had controlled the web, and developers had to ask permission to create Google, Youtube, eBay, Paypal, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Sadly, this is where we’re headed on mobile.",1396905761

There was a time when every application you wanted on the desktop had to be installed natively. This was because of the following reasons: web didn&#x27;t exist yet, web existed but the tools sucked, web existed but networks were slow. Over time the networks got fast enough and the tools got good enough that the vast majority of applications could be built as a website. There are still cases where building a desktop application makes sense such as when performance is critical, but those cases are in the minority now. Building a website also has the distinct advantage that you only need to build it once and it works everywhere (mostly).<p>When it comes to mobile, I think we are in the &quot;web exists and the tools are almost good enough but the networks suck&quot; phase.

Are you admitting that you simply don&#x27;t like and have no sympathy for &quot;people like that?&quot;<p>This is not an interpersonal conflict. This is not about someone &quot;being a jerk.&quot; At least I hope not. At least, I hope principles of tolerance underlie everything in such an action, and not action/adventure show style ad-hominem morality. (i.e. &quot;He deserved it!&quot;)",1396904406

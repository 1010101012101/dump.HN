Thoughts are like contractions - sometimes they are purposeful when they are part of a movement, an extension of my will. But sometimes they are not; in that way the incessant chatter of the internal monologue, or worse yet, stress, is similar to a cramping muscle, a flood of contractions that come unbidden. Meditation, then, is similar to relaxation exercises, doing stretches or posture training - teaching your muscles how to be at rest. This can then also translate into efficiency and economy of motion when you choose to move, not to mention more energy, because all the useless contractions/thoughts haven&#x27;t worn you out beforehand. Also, yoga makes a lot of sense when you think of it this way, because you literally do this for both your body and brain at the same time.",1377589630

The way Kickstarter and Indiegogo do things has fuck-all to do with limiting innovation or stopping people from creating real products.<p>Without violating my NDA, I can share the following:<p>Both companies have the same set of goals: to provide a marketplace for innovative ideas. They have different ways of achieving this.<p>Kickstarter does this by allowing select projects to be associated with its brand, which due to their selective nature, confers a perception of trustworthiness to potential funders. You know that there&#x27;s very little chance of a Kickstarter project being a scam, and moreover, that the project you fund will probably make good on their promises.<p>This is why they&#x27;ve stopped allowing product mockups -- to lower risk for funders.<p>Indiegogo is more liberal, allowing your project to succeed or fail based on the strength of your network, rather than the additional trust conferred by the brand itself. While the guys over at &#x27;gogo are really focused on preventing fraud, the very nature of &#x27;every project can be funded&#x27; means that more projects will fail to ship.<p>In my experience, Indiegogo is really great for projects where the goal is <i>not</i> some type of new product, but rather some sort of well-understood goal. Like saving a clinic for pregnant woman in San Francisco, or raising money for a child to get a lung transplant. Kickstarter is more about innovation -- Cards Against Humanity, the Pebble watch, etc.<p>Same goal, different ways of getting there.

  Disabling broken behaviour by default is a good thing. It

So there&#x27;s your phone number, but there&#x27;s also some kind of network address that I have received from the carrier, and then probably some kind of address that refers to my connection with the tower.<p>I would assume that something similar to ARP goes on here. A message comes in for 415xxxxxxx, my phone. When AT&T gets it, they determine that phone number is network address 1234, and they have some system that says 1234 is currently in tower X. Tower X gets the message and broadcasts a request for the phone corresponding to device 1234. At this point, pirate device with tower address ABCD responds that it is, falsely, AT&T&#x27;s 1234. The message is then sent to the the phone whose address in tower space is ABCD. My phone was actually DEFG but I couldn&#x27;t reply fast enough.<p>So, if this pirate phone responds to multiple requests, for multiple AT&T subscriber addresses, claiming to have all those addresses, can&#x27;t the tower just cap it at like 3 addresses? After that can&#x27;t it be determined to be a pirate device and disconnected from the network? If one device claims messages intended for more than 3 addresses, isn&#x27;t it safe to say it&#x27;s faulty or spoofing?<p>Where am I wrong here? It seems like this level of ability should be built into a protocol that requires recipients to identify themselves? Like if I issue an ARP request on my Ethernet network, and the same MAC address always comes back, that would be a detectable attack (assuming it was not my gateway).

I&#x27;m not sure why this ad was released now though... perhaps asking the faithful not to jump ship, even though there are now fairly well-designed competitive products in the market?

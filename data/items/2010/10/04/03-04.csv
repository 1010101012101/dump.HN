I’ll tell you where: waiting to spring this on OEMs when they had their own device out there that they need to gain traction against Android.""<p>The author had me until this. Whenever someone tells me ""I'll tell you why..."" in that tone, it is usually because they are angry, and anger is usually not the best ingredient for clear thinking.<p>First off, Microsoft has been floundering around in the mobile space, because:<p>1 - Windows Mobile was just a disabled version of Windows, just like J2ME was a disabled version of Java. It was a whole new environment. They should have developed Win Mobile from scratch.<p>2 - Windows Mobile is no iOS. iOS was adopted by users because of the great hardware and software design. Win Mobile- design stuck in the early 2000s.<p>3 - Android was well adopted because (a) it was Google and (b) it was free. And oh yeah, it is pretty good, even if not as snazzy as iOS all of the time. So far Windows Mobile, not so much.<p>MS had a number of opportunities to position itself as a ""real OS"" running on a mobile device and do something with that possibly, but it didn't.<p>So MS screwed up and has now decided to go on the attack to divert attention from the recent press on Ballmer losing his bonus because of Win Mobile, as well as Win Mobile being a failure in the news.<p>MS also probably smelt blood with the Oracle suit and Wifi spying and figured Google's lawyers and PR were as weak as they might get anytime soon. Also they don't come off as the bad guys like Oracle, and their suit probably gains more legitimacy when there are other high profile suits.<p>But seriously, were they waiting on this opportunity like hungry wolves <i>to gain traction on Android</i>? No, Win Mobile is nowhere near Android, so it wouldn't make sense to take a slash at them to try to gain on Android. It would just mean Apple would get more sales. They want to take down <i>Google</i>.<p>Despite all of this, MS is still worth watching. Even though they shouldn't try to head to head with Google so much, and they'd do better by focusing efforts on new products and markets and pretending Google and Apple didn't exist, they aren't going away anytime soon.",1286163888

However, I rarely see companies paying 10X salary to top developers.  The top salary is usually at 2X of the average, with some industries paying 4X or 5X for bonus, like trading firms.<p>In a conversation with the Sr VP of Eng in my last company on why so many engineers have become managers, I mentioned that the pay scale for the top engineering position (architect) was equivalent of a senior eng director and it was very hard to become one.  He said, well, he could talk to the board to create a Sr Architect position equivalent to VP's pay.  The problem is there are more management positions than senior engineering positions like architect or principle.  The engineers end up going the management route to get better pay.<p>But you can tell the general mentality that engineers should not make more than the management's pay structure.  It's very hard to justify to others to pay someone 10X of the average.",1286163719

1754481,comment,1754134,1754134,0,0,apu,,,"To add to the many good responses here so far: AI is such an overloaded term with many negative connotations that it's no longer used. It's also now specialized into separate components, as researchers realize that it's not ""cheating"" to study e.g. vision separately from natural language processing. Even humans cheat, by having separate portions of the brain specialize in different parts of ""AI"".<p>So some of the major AI fields are now known as:<p><pre><code>  * machine learning - learning from data, aka applied statistics, aka how to ""learn""\n  * computer/machine vision - how to ""see""\n  * natural language processing - how to ""read"" and ""write"" and ""translate""\n  * speech recognition - how to ""hear""\n  * robotics - how to ""do""\n  * affective computing - how to ""feel"" and ""act""\n</code></pre>\nThere are others as well, but as you can see from this simplistic breakdown, the specialities loosely mirror those in biology/medicine/neuroscience, and indeed there are also researchers who straddle the boundaries between the natural side and the computation side of things.<p>As a vision researcher, I can tell you that there's a huge amount of work being done, and progress being made, in our field -- both in academia and in industry. While it often doesn't make the news, we consider this a feature, not a bug.<p>For following progress in these fields, I have two comments:<p>1. There's no good resource I know of to follow all the subfields of AI. Instead, there are different sources for each field.<p>2. While others have recommended journals and conferences, I think it can be tough to read them if you're not already immersed in the field. So instead, I'd recommend starting with the wikipedia pages for each field, seeing the general list of topics, and then finding the appropriate papers if you're really interested. A good way to find important papers is by looking on google scholar for papers with lots of citations (insert usual disclaimers here about citations != quality of work, etc.)<p>I can get you started in computer vision with two very influential papers in the last decade that have also had a huge impact on industry:<p><i>P. Viola and M. Jones - Robust Real-time Object Detection</i>\n<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/viola/Pubs/Detect/violaJones_CVPR2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/viola/Pubs/Det...</a><p>This paper revolutionized face detection, and is the basis for automatic face detection in most consumer cameras.<p><i>D.

Many other federal states have similarly strict requirements when passing federal legislation, but have gone as far as to rewrite their constitutions from scratch.<p>If my understanding is correct, then what explains the US Constitution's position in political culture and discourse? I have been given the strong impression that the Constitution is regarded in many quarters as an immutable guarantee of basic freedoms or a fixed check on the powers of the state, but on a practical level it seems to be no such thing. There is a strong rhetoric in many quarters that if something is allowed or prohibited by the constitution then it is irrevocably and permanently allowed or prohibited, but the history of the document seems to contradict that.<p>The eighteenth amendment was repealed, why not the tenth? If the sixteenth amendment empowered the federal government to collect taxes directly, what would preclude a twenty-eighth amendment from allowing it to impose basic rights for employees?<p>It is my understanding that there is a federal minimum wage. Is this unconstitutional? If so, what real political significance does the constitution hold if it is so freely disregarded?<p>Apologies to all for the barrage of questions, but I have done a reasonable amount of reading on the subject and am genuinely baffled by the almost mythical nature of the US constitution and the apparent gulf between perception and reality.",1286161485

Most of the comparisons, looking at those statistics are to other forms of tyranny.  There are very few free countries, and few people who have been educated to respect human rights enough to take up arms to overthrow their government to defend them.  When these people do this, though, as the somalis overthrew their dictator, they are visited by no end of warmaking from these so-called ""peaceful"" democracies.  Somalia has been attacked without provocation by the US and UK many times since throwing off their dictator.<p>As for the Yanamamo, I'm not familiar with them, but it would be interesting to understand how many of these homicides are murders and how many are instances of the death penalty.

That's seriously not newsworthy, or worrying in the least. Who cares? really...<p>It's just FUD. Shop owners all bought CCTV systems in the 80s to protect against theft.

The central government, desiring to look good to the common people, reports a level of economic growth X+N. One clue that the central government statistics are dubious is that provincial governments report figures that would imply a level of X+N+M (all numbers are positive numbers), yet the central government doesn't aggregate the provincial figures, implying that the provincial governments desire to look good to the central government. Another clue that the central government statistics are dubious is that online discussion of those statistics expresses open doubt, even in a country with much state control of all mass media.<p>Does this look like a fair summary of the article's claims?

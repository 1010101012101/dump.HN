As far as I can tell, all of the long-time devs oppose any filtering, since SD is working within the limitations of the Bitcoin protocol as it is defined.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  But I agree with you that SD could try to find some ways to reduce the quantity of spam.  One simple but drastic solution would be to run their own block chain and use it as poker chips that players could easily buy with Bitcoins (once you're in the virtual currency system, exchanging currencies is trivial).",1362754730

Dispersed energy from traffic could be captured to operate its active self-leveling and status-reporting functions. When a section breaks - which like any road it will - a crew is notified, brings out a new section, pops out the old, installs the new within a few minutes, and moves on. No more long-term breakdowns, huge effort ripping out old road, long period rebuilding a replacement - all due to building asphalt/concrete roads as permanent structures which aren't.<p>Yes, up front costs are higher, but we've been building roads long enough to know there are substantial long term maintenance and replacement costs.",1362754721

5343670,comment,5342824,5342824,3,0,eric_bullington,,,"The main complaint with Satoshi Dice is that most of their transactions are not actually transferring any value (actually, they are transferring a tiny bit of value if I understand correctly; I've never used SD).  They're using the Bitcoin system as a secure message system to notify everyone who lost a bet (i.e., most betters).  It seems to me that Satoshi Dice could very easily create their own block chain to do this and just use it as poker chips, which would take all the load of the Bitcoin system.  Once you are ""in"" the virtual currency system, it's quite easy to exchange currencies.  The hard part is getting your dollars in.<p>But Bitcoin would have run up against the block size limit at some point anyway; the vast quantity of Satoshi Dice transactions have only accelerated the confrontation of this dilemma.  I actually appreciate the fact that Satoshi Dice is effectively stress testing the system. Bitcoin block size is a serious impediment to scaling up.<p>I wonder if Bitcoin core dev (and Google employee) Mike Hearn has consulted with Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat about this issue.  I know that Bitcoin recently switched from Berkeley DB to leveldb for most of the client's bookkeeping, which would have been a good opportunity for Mike to approach them about this dilemma.  However, I know that all the core Bitcoin devs are already very capable, so I'm not sure if a technological solution to this issue even exists.  The answer may be more political (i.e., convincing all the miners to go along with an idea).<p><idlespeculation>On a related note, I wonder what the level of adoption of Bitcoin is among Google employees.  As mentioned above, Mike Hearn is a Google employee and a long-term Bitcoin core dev.  I would speculate that the level of adoption is relatively high, which makes me also speculate about when Google might start accepting Bitcoin.  Anyone care to comment?</idlespeculation>",1362753999

All they want are the IP addresses, so they can cross-reference it against their list of infringer IPs and names/addresses from other cases and then file individual <i>copyright</i> suits against those people as punishment.<p>It makes this a very high stakes game, since even if the court throws out the result of the subpoena for use in the libel case, Prenda gets what they want.  You could argue that is why they filed three separate actions in three different courts, just to up the odds that one of them would get the desired information.<p>They've done very similar things before, where they filed a lawsuit against the same list of IP addresses / John Does in a dozen different venues, because they only needed one judge to allow the discovery request to go through to get what they wanted.",1362753278

This could be made difficult by the merchant continually generating new addresses. The merchant could also add a little sweetener (transaction fee), and it feels pretty likely that a proportion of the wider BTC community would overcome their (presumably) ethical concerns and process the transactions anyway.<p>But yes, in principle, colluding miners could make life difficult for merchants they dislike.

5343607,comment,5342824,5342824,10,0,eof,,,"I am not a developer for bitcoin, but I have been following along in #bitcoin-dev and reading some of the forum threads. (most interesting conversation by far is on freenode)<p>In pools/miners that are not blocking satoshi dice 70-95% of every block is filled with SD transactions.  Further, SD has upped their fees to get higher priority.<p>Interestingly, the sentiment of the devs and the sentiment of the users is <i>vastly</i> different.  It seems that the users are overwhelmingly pro SD, anti filtering out SD transactions, and think this is just a nice test for bitcoin and this type of transaction volume is inevitable anyway.  (plus, they are of the libertarian leaning in general).<p>Sentiment amongst the devs varies, but it does seem they all agree that SD is abusing the blockchain.  There is no reason SD can't remain provably fair and have the same flow without spamming the blockchain; and, since they are reusing addresses and acting in a such a way that their transactions <i>can</i> be trivailly tracked, there is no reason (in some of the devs' minds) to not treat them as spam and filter out their transactions.<p>For their own part, the owners of SD have reportedly taken a ""fix your shit"" attitude when asked to change their methods.<p>In any case, it has spurred a lot of discussion on ""how"" to raise the soft limit; which is completely arbitrary, and many pools have already raised it regardless.  The real news is that the `hard` limit, which <i>will</i> create a fork is not even an order of magnitude away.  No one wants to keep making hard forks, so there is a lot of debate on how to best determine future block limit size on a system wide scale.<p>For my own part, it is hard not to see SD as spamming/abusing the blockchain.  If I ran a mining pool or a hasher (I don't) I would block SD as Luke-jr does by not including addresses into blocks that start with `1dice`.  It's note worthy that it would be essentially impossible (rather than trivial) to censor SD transactions if they followed best practices.<p>It is also worth noting that there are whispers of SD transaction volume being something of a conspiracy.  I have not done any analysis on this; but what I have heard is that the vast majority of SD transactions appear to be bots, playing losing bets 24 hours a day.  SD has issued stock, which is publicly traded.",1362753256

I was going to pick up Sim City. I remember playing it years ago and I loved it. I thought this would be awesome. Now I am definitely not getting it and I can confidently resolve that I will not be buying any future Sim City title.<p>It is a similar situation with Diablo 3. I was going to get it but after friends abandoned it after about 10 days I figured it wasn't worth it. It also had the same problems as Starcraft with requiring you to be online to even play 'offline' game modes.<p>A couple of friends and I decided to have a games night a few weeks ago. We lugged our computers to one person's house like the good old days. Got them all running. Installed a bunch of old games and were disappointed to find the majority of multiplayer servers were shut down. Today I read that Sim City stores your saved games online. (I don't know how true this is.) What happens in 5 years time when EA cut back or disconnect their servers? Won't the game be completely unplayable?<p>Its only in digital good's that you can get screwed like Sim City users are. If I brought Monopoly and found the board was missing I could take it back. Buy a game which doesn't work.. well suck it up fella. Similarly, Amazon can ban your account and you lose access to Kindle books you legitimately paid for...<p>I might have my facts incorrect here but if an App is removed from the Play / iOS app stores isn't it removed from users devices? What happens to any money you put into those apps?<p>Pretty much any digital good you buy cannot be resold. Usually reselling your account under which you made such purchases is also not allowed. All in all its a shitty deal for anyone buying digital goods.<p>Yesterday I read how the EU is getting ready to fine Microsoft presumably for shipping Windows 8 without a browser select screen.

The hash input data for the block is transaction data. Per-protocol rules, any miner is allowed to ignore any transaction they want to. Partly this is so that they can (if they wish) concentrate on processing transactions with a decent fee attached. This is thought to become a more significant thing as the built in reward for block discovery shrinks over time.<p>Therefore there is no guarantee that any transaction will be processed at all, and certainly no guarantee that it will be done in a timely fashion. Though it probably will. This is part of the wait for confirmation.<p>If a large miner group ignores satoshidice it doesn't mean that they disregard satoshidice transactions, it just means that they won't use them as input to the blocks they're attempting to mine. Others will still use them as input, and if the successful block comes from one of these others then the whole ecosystem counts the transaction.<p>However, If <i>everyone</i> did this, then satoshidice would indeed find it close to impossible to get transactions into the system.<p>--edit-- obviously this doesn't address your anonymity concerns, but others have done that.",1362751375

2737903,comment,2737645,2737645,13,0,melvinram,,,"Very interesting experience. The real issue is deciding on what assumptions you want to make about your audience. Even people who are not completely new to computers may act like people who have never used one before so making as few assumptions as possible is probably best unless you have a strong degree of confidence.<p>A few weeks ago, I visited a cousin who had recently bought a new fridge with ""high-tech"" water dispenser. I'm a big water drinker. When I went to the fridge to get some cold water, I felt really stupid for not knowing how to work a freaken water dispenser. It had a ton of buttons the real button to make it give you water looked like it was part of the door, not a press-able thing. The design could have been done better.<p>How many times have you been at someone's house and needed to use their microwave and it takes more time figuring out how to make the thing go than to actually heat the food? And even if you've used the exact same microwave 4 weeks ago, it still feels brand new and you feel just as lost.<p>Whether it's directions to a location or how to use an app/device, it may not stick.<p>Designing for computer illiterates but decently intelligent people seems like a worthy ideal to strive for. You may never get to a point where someone brand new to computers will feel comfortable with your app but keeping it in mind might help guide us into making small tweaks that can add up a big difference.<p>One example: With WordPress, you can add a search element to your site/blog. The default language of the label is ""To search, type and hit enter."" This is probably more clear than ""Search this site"" or plain ""Search"" but maybe not as clear as ""To search, click here, type and hit enter.""<p>Yes, it's more verbose. No, I'm not suggesting that WP should change the default text.<p>You have to strike a balance between being clear and not boring your audience by telling them what they already know but when in doubt, err on the side of clarity.",1310032658

There is educational, interesting, funny, agree, disagree, and love for each post.<p>I have to say I really appreciate Ravelry having so many options for voting. I used to post a lot in one of the tech forums on Ravelry, especially in reply to one person that kept posting information that was secondhand and wildly inaccurate. Unfortunately, she would have her own groupies (for lack of a better term) that would vote her comment as educational/agree/love. I would also have people that backed me up in the same way. If you didn't have any disagrees (for which I had far less than she did) you wouldn't be able to easily tell who to listen to. Nor is a straightforward up/down type voting system the best in a discussion.<p>I think that system is fabulous especially for forums and discussion mediums (see also: slashdot).

She needed it though - her current way of getting information is Teletext (UK-wide information system built into analogue TV broadcasts).

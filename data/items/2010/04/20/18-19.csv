1280153,comment,1279353,1279586,0,0,Perceval,,,"Adam Smith wrote an interesting section of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> on the issue of education.  It appears in Book V of the volume, which is the book where he begins to qualify his otherwise <i>laissez faire</i> position.  The section ""Education of Youth"" is Chapter 1, Part III, Article II.<p>Most of the section is devoted to explaining why endowing public money for educational institutions has a negative effect on the quality of teaching.  Most of the arguments should be familiar to anyone who follows debates about public education, teachers unions, etc.  It's pretty clear that Smith thinks full public funding for education will produce a negative outcome.<p>However, he does then start to make a critique of a society lacking any education or virtues—one that's actually quite similar to the critiques Tocqueville and Nietzsche would make decades later.  Talking about the effect of the functional division of labor on the populace he writes:<p><i>But the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments.  The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur.  He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.  The torpor of his mind renders him, not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life.\n...\nHis dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues.  But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the laboring poor, that is, the great body of people, must necessarily fall, unless the government takes some pains to prevent it.</i><p>He goes on to write a justification for the public funding of the education of the poor.  The state should teach the Three R's by establishing parish schools, giving prizes for academic achievement, and requiring students to pass exams before entering a trade.  In this way, he writes:<p><i>The more they are instructed, the less liable they are to the delusions of [religious] enthusiasm and superstition, which, among ignorant nations, frequently occasion the most dreadful disorders.  An instructed and intelligent people besides, are always more decent and orderly than an ignorant and stupid one.  They feel themselves, each individually more respectable, and more likely to obtain the respect of their lawful superiors, and they are therefore more disposed to respect those superiors.  They are more disposed to examine, and more capable of seeing through, the interested complaints of faction and sedition, and they are, upon that account, less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to the measures of government.</i><p>You should keep in mind that Smith is justifying <i>only</i> public funding for the education of poor youth, not general funding for the education of all at all levels.  Nevertheless, even Smith saw areas in which <i>laissez faire</i> needn't be strictly followed, and which could benefit society if the government were to intervene.",1271787215

They form three separate supports that must together cover the expense.<p>In practice, Medicare/Medicaid form a near monopsony -- they're the 800lb gorillas, and can demand capitulation to their reimbursement rates. On the opposite side, cash patients are few, and many of those are expected to be bad debts, and so contribute little. Thus, the pressure release must be through private insurance payments. And that's why your insurance rates are increasing.<p>This is also why many experts fear that Obamacare's plans will squeeze private insurance out of the business, despite the ""public option"" being putatively off the table. If regulations hold government reimbursement down to a fraction of real cost, private insurance is forced to take up the slack. That necessitates raising rates, and thus forces customers out of private plans. But they're required to be insured, so they must move into a government-controlled plan.<p>Edit: awkward phrasing in 1st para",1271786822

According to me, if I have higher education, I get a better job, better salary, more respect in social circle. Compared to this, what does society get if I am educated?</i><p>He never said more goes to society.  He just said some of the benefit cannot be captured by the individual.<p>This is trivially true.  Employers pay an individual somewhere between nothing and the value that individual contributes.  If an educated individual contributes more than an uneducated one, then the educated individual is likely to get more salary than the uneducated one <i>AND</i> the employer has a larger gap between salary paid and value captured.  (Incidentally there is typically a gap between the value provided by the employer and the revenue collected, which provides yet another layer of more broadly spread societal benefit that is not seen by the individual.)<p>That excess value is captured by private companies that may or may not even have existed at the time that the individual was being educated.  That is value going to society that is not captured by the individual, and hence which can't be recouped through any kind of student loan program.",1271786702

The vast majority of potential clients you will run across don't look at your work as a value creation, but something they should dispense with as cheap as possible.<p>Thinking of spending money as value creation is a fairly rare way of thinking.<p>Any freelancer who's worked with more than a handful of clients is going to have practically INFINITE stories of clients trying to stiff them, devalue their work, complain about how long it takes, ""It's on a computer, can't you just, like, click a button?"" etc.<p>Moreover, freelancing is not just about creating value for the client. It's about meeting their specifications. If the business value they receive is less than your hourly rate, they should have said ""No."" or not done the project to begin with.<p>Moreover again, even if the project creates more business value than your hourly rate, and even if the client thinks in terms of value investment instead of costs... they would still need to be understand the amount of work involved in making it happen.<p>What a mess.<p>People are probably excited about this idea because they're too scared to price.

Keep your day job for a year or a year and a half. Then ask yourself the question again.<p>If you need a project, focus on cutting your expenses. Learn to budget. Learn to cook. Pay off the credit cards. Move to a less expensive apartment. Every dollar you cut from the budget is not just a dollar you get to save for when you're self-employed, but a dollar that you <i>won't be spending</i> when you're self-employed, because you won't be in the habit of spending it.<p>If ""storm clouds are on the horizon"" then there's a chance you'll get laid off in the next year. Then you can collect unemployment while you're looking for a day job that doesn't restrict your extracurricular activities. If you quit now, you'd have to do that anyway, without the benefit of the insurance.<p>I would listen to the lawyers and not-a-lawyers in this thread: Don't do startup work while you're still employed at the company.",1206125917

Believe that you only have 4 months (or maybe even 3) and do everything you can to make your project work in that time.  ""Work"" doesn't mean it'll be perfect.  Get it up and adjust on the fly.  PG has said it.  Others have said it.  Launch and iterate.  You can do it!<p>We're all rooting for you!",1206125867

142667,comment,142603,142603,0,0,aflag,,,"I'm a bit unsure about the benefits of wubi. I admit I probably haven't given the topic enough consideration, but at first thought giving Windows users an easier time seems hurtful for free software. After all, it will encourage people to keep using non-free software. I say that because people using windows will be encouraged to keep their windows and using wubi for installing GNU/Linux, which runs right from windows' file system. So I expect that people meeting free software through that path is more likely to always keep using non-free software, as opposed to the ones who have a free system installed on a different partition.<p>Of course, one may argue that stuff like wubi makes it easier for people who would never use free software to at least try some. But if our ultimate goal is to have everyone using free software only, is that being hepful in the long term? That's a question that I never fully understood the answer, maybe someone here can shed me some light.<p>As you can notice, I do believe in free software as the best mean of software distribution, I'm a little tired of discussing that; so I hope people will talk about my question rather than my premisse that the ultimate goal is to have people only using free software.",1206125696

Four years later, he had a tough time getting an apartment in SF because he had no credit.<p>It's stupid, and credit card companies definitely target college students knowing that many of them will end up paying severe penalties and interest charges.

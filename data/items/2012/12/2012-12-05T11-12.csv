Second, they'd have to build a system with the same write-rate as all of the internet backbone.  This stuff isn't cheap, and the NSA's budget is big, but not that big.<p>As 1/3rd of the US's internet traffic is porn, which you can really just de-dup by URL, it's a safe bet to say that they're filtering before they transmit data back home.  The same goes for streaming video traffic.  The remainder is mostly web with a small fraction being actual communication between people.  For the NSA's mission, even implemented in the most evil way, they just don't have the money, means, or motivation to record <i>everything</i>.

Flexible PEX tubing these cut out a ton of traditional cutting and brazing plumbing labor to install hot water loops.

In my opinion that's only part of the problem. It's more difficult to get the structure of sentences and tenses correct. I personally know words in 2 - 3 languages which share a root with my mother tongue, but it doesn't mean that I can speak those languages because I often don't get the way a single word transforms based on the tense, part of speech etc. For eg. merely knowing the word ""smile"" would only take you so far. Knowing the difference between ""He is smiling"", ""He smiles"", ""He keeps smiling at me"" is the tricky part.<p>Perhaps we are obsessed with learning words because it's the easier problem to solve.

Also, combining several (linear/radial) gradients so they fill the background <i>just</i> right like that, I wouldn't even have attempted in GIMP (and instead end up with something that only looks <i>sorta</i> right).<p>BTW do you happen to know what is the best format to save in, so that somebody with Adobe Illustrator can easily use it?

4875771,comment,4875592,4875592,5,0,diasks2,,,"That's a good list. I think the most important first step is to find what really interests you (whether that be comic books, TV shows, movies, music) and use that as a starting point.  For example,  a lot of people I know learned Japanese because they were interested in anime.  If you are studying something that truly interests you, it is much easier to stay motivated.<p>In my opinion, there is still a lot of room for innovation in the online language learning space.  It is a very tough problem to solve and it is one that I am currently working on with my startup - BiFluent[1].  Our thesis is that one thing that is really missing for people learning a foreign language is metrics.  If you are running a startup, I'm sure you could immediately tell me how many new users signed up today, what your current conversion rate is, etc.  But can you do the same thing if you are learning a foreign language?  Can you tell me what your level was 1 year ago, 6 months ago, 1 month ago? Can you tell me (precisely) what your strengths are, and what your weaknesses are (speaking, pronunciation, vocabulary, idioms, grammar, etc.)? Can you tell me which words you should be studying next, based on frequency analysis and tailored to fit your study goals?  I believe that if you truly know your level, and if you are able to measure your improvement over short term periods (every month), it becomes much easier to stay motivated and stay on track.<p>One tool we are hoping to ship in the next week or so is a vocabulary assessment tool. Historically, the only way people have measured vocabulary is by the number of words you know.  For example, ""I know 5,000 words"". In my opinion, this is a vanity metric.  It doesn't really tell us any useful, actionable information. Our new tool reports what we call your Vocabulary Coverage Ratio. This is the percentage of the total vocabulary of a language that you will know or understand (analyzed on a frequency basis).  So, for example, if your Vocabulary Coverage Ratio is 85%, this means that you will understand 85% of the vocabulary in any given situation.  After we ascertain your level with our tool, we can also break out your coverage ratio across different mediums (TV, newspapers, magazines, fiction) using the data in our corpus.  Also, once we know your vocabulary coverage ratio, we can use the frequency analysis in our database to give you tailored study lists.  These study lists will show you the next 50 most frequent words you should be studying based on your current level and interest (we have different lists for medical, business, SAT, GRE, TOEIC, etc.). If you choose the right words to target, you can quickly improve your coverage ratio.<p>So in conclusion, I think the best ""hack"" is a mix of two things. 1) You need to find what interests you and use that as a jumping point 2) you need to use science and tools to accelerate your progress (just like we use analysis tools in every other aspect of our lives).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.bifluent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bifluent.com</a>",1354705761

Everything about the language is redesigned so people can understand it better.<p>Math (well, math to undergraduate college level) doesn't.  To even have a chance of understanding a concept in math, you are forced to use an Ancient Greek symbol system.  Once your done with that, the formulas are written in a very specific forum and very specific pattern that your forced to learn in order to understand it at a higher level.<p>In a way, it's like learning the concepts of object oriented java by only having access to assembly language syntax.  Yes, it's possible to learn it that way but there are better ways to understand it.<p>Why is math so obsessed with ancient syntax and conceptual frameworks?  Why isn't there a Python for math?  Why isn't there new conceptual frameworks for math being used out there being created?   Why does math feel so obsolete?  Is the methods used for math today really the best way to present math to modern day people?",1354705746

It's too much of a crap shoot for any single app to be noticed and profitable in the App Store.<p>It's kind of like the story of the California Gold Rush isn't it? Here's an excerpt -<p>""Recent scholarship confirms that merchants made far more money than miners during the Gold Rush. The wealthiest man in California during the early years of the Gold Rush was Samuel Brannan, the tireless self-promoter, shopkeeper and newspaper publisher. Brannan opened the first supply stores in Sacramento, Coloma, and other spots in the gold fields. Just as the Gold Rush began, he purchased all the prospecting supplies available in San Francisco and re-sold them at a substantial profit. However, substantial money was made by some gold-seekers as well.""<p>Tell me you can't see the similarities with the modern day digital mobile gold rush.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush#Profits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush#Profits</a>",1354705681
4875766,comment,4873403,4874640,1,0,rbanffy,,,"A lot of the reasoning behind extending surveillance stems from the need to find the people who enable the dangerous people to do dangerous things.<p>One example: when I got robbed a couple years back (an armed guy stole my laptop), I had the opportunity to discuss the strategies with the detective in charge of my case. A lot of resources were devoted to catch the guy with the gun, but very little to catching the person (or organization) buying the stolen goods (in this case, a laptop) and reselling them. If you catch the robber, it's easy to replace him. If you disrupt the chain at the receptor, you will do more damage. OTOH, if you catch the unsuspecting buyer of a stolen laptop, he (or she) will gladly point the authorities to the store where they'll find a convergence of many such value-chains. This is where most of the money is and where the most damage will be done to the system. That's why now I have the serial number of my laptops written down and all their labels photographed and stored. And all sensitive information encrypted, in case they don't want my laptop, but the data on it.<p>Having said that, catching the people who support the really dangerous extremists, the drug-dealers, the pedophiles and the slave-traders involves catching who, at the surface, seems rather harmless, making donations to religious organizations, smoking a joint at a party, buying porn online and groceries from Walmart.<p>On one hand, we may want to make our technology difficult to abuse, but, on the other, we may also want to find people who are very good at protecting their tracks, and do so through people who really don't know how to do it.",1354705625

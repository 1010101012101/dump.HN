The attribute/element dichotomy also makes a lot of sense in that context.<p>Regarding structured machine-generated data (which is where XML actually is used most today), s-expressions are arguably simpler.",1214394892
227402,comment,226153,226153,0,0,terpua,,,"Quick comments:<p>1) Ability to add our own news/blog sources (good for you to expand news sources)
2) Remove username from registration (I realize it's only one field but it's one field less to fill in and don't see the point to it)
3) Make news sources font smaller and in different color.  If hyperlinked, it will go to the actual collection of articles from that news source.<p>Simple stock news engine for hobby investors.  Useful app.",1214394829

Scientist A publishes results.<p>Scientist B: A, I tried duplicating your experiment, but  parameters x, y, and z that I need were not in your article. I need you to disclose to me x, y, and z that you used at the time. What are they?
A: x, y, and z are such and such.
B: Using x, y, and z, my result doesn't agree with yours at all. Are you sure you did the procedures that you claimed?
A: ...
B: You fraud!<p>Scientific scrutiny does not work like this:<p>A publishes results.
B: I have Generic Skepticism toward your article. Under code viii of the Publication Criteria, I demand that you give me all of your data!
A: ... ok...? It seems that everything you would need is already in the article. Did you have something specific in mind?
B: A has refused to attach all data he has ever used for the experiment. He is withholding information and thus hiding something.'",1214394160

227386,comment,227006,227078,0,0,warwick,,,"I was thinking a lot like this, but recently I've changed my opinion.  Just to contradict your 'only web devs like it', I'll mention that most of my work is done in Obj-C and Cocoa.<p>Web apps have some inherent advantages.  Being 'installed' by clicking on a link, which lowers the barrier to a user trying your app.  Having data available everywhere.  Autoupdating that doesn't involve a download and relaunch.<p>Traditionally I've been opposed to putting full apps on the web.  I didn't think I could deliver as good of an interface with it, but seeing SC and 280North changed my mind.<p>I should mention that though I'm looking at porting one of my desktop products, I'm intending to maintain the desktop app and the port in parallel and give customers a choice if they want to download the desktop app.",1214393573

They think that making something ""designed"" means smearing pretty on it after you're done, as if you can design a web application by building something randomly then hiring a graphic designer to make the page slook nice just before you go live.",1214392569

227376,comment,227262,227262,0,0,ced,,,"I conjecture that the more low-level the language, the more premature optimization is necessary.<p>As an example, an assembly language programmer has to make very early decisions about whether to use a WORD (valuing speed), or a long (valuing extensibility) to model a quantity. If he chooses wrong, he will have to modify hundreds of lines of code. A C programmer, instead, can use a typedef and then switch between the two representations at any time, but he might have to choose between long and big-integer. Lisp programmers don't have that choice to make.<p>In the perfect HLL (by that metric), every parameter or constraint of the program is specified in just one place. Premature optimization is then always a mistake.<p>(Lisp still has a way to go to get there)",1214392197

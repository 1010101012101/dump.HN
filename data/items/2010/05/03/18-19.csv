PCI - DSS = Payment Card Industry Digital Security Standard.<p>Simply put, there are 12 areas that you need to pay close attention to, and I've pasted them below.<p>Build and Maintain a Secure Network<p>Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data\nRequirement 2: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters<p>Protect Cardholder Data<p>Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data\nRequirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks<p>Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program<p>Requirement 5: Use and regularly update anti-virus software\nRequirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications<p>Implement Strong Access Control Measures<p>Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know\nRequirement 8: Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access\nRequirement 9: Restrict physical access to cardholder data<p>Regularly Monitor and Test Networks<p>Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data\nRequirement 11: Regularly test security systems and processes<p>Maintain an Information Security Policy<p>Requirement 12: Maintain a policy that addresses information security<p>For more information on PCI-DSS, go to <a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org</a>. Also, consider downloading the PCI-DSS, its a 60-70 page PDF with all of the information that you need on the PCI-DSS. It also contains a Self-Assessment Questionnaire that you can use to review your site or app.<p>As I work with ecommerce sites daily, I can assure you, PCI is not something that you want to ignore. At the same time, its not terribly difficult to adhere to the rules.<p>As a quick reminder, any site that is found to be non-compliant at the time of a breach could face fines into the hundreds of thousands of dollars ($ USD)",1272913190

1315629,comment,1314719,1315039,0,0,grandalf,,,"To your first point: There are certainly rare exceptions.  But the broader effect of public schools is to remove competition and choice, so the natural tendency of humans to compare various options and make a choice (as a projection of individual identity) is suppressed.<p>People value things because they chose them and because they realized that ""wait a second, I have to pick which one I want, so which one <i>is better</i>?""  (I experienced this phenomenon first hand when asked about my preferences on china patterns, and it's visible even in poor communities with things like mobile phones and athletic shoes).<p>To your second point:  In a rich community (Greenwich CT, the Chicago suburbs, etc.) the public schools are exceptionally well funded and well supported.  I know people who attended public schools where most of the faculty had masters degrees and some had doctorates.  This does not represent the success of public provisioning, on the contrary, it represents the ability of a community with enough sufficiently powerful and motivated people to shape a  public school into what they want (with the aid of lots of tax dollars).  I think it's fairly obvious that communities like this would find a way to provide excellent education for their children even if classes had to be held in an old barn. Of course, public school apologists are quick to take credit for any excellence they can find.<p>Meanwhile, the inner city poor beg for voucher systems and are denied by powerful teachers unions, etc. The poor simply lack the political power and resources to overcome the state sanctioned education monopoly.<p>Notably, one reason why your statistic of private schools being worse is true is because some of the largest serve vast numbers of the urban poor for pennies on the dollar (compared with public schools).  Much of this (due to the shortage of funds created by the public monopoly) is via Catholic charities, but it's still a remarkable accomplishment.<p>Even so, those schools reach a limit and have to turn people away...  Meanwhile funding gets pumped into failed public schools (many of which can't even offer a safe environment free of violence) and parents who weren't lucky enough to get a spot in an affordable private school must send their kids into these awful prisons every day.",1272911834

It's one of the many components of meeting compliance with the PCI DSS.  Many requirements are taken into consideration as part of any individual organization's compliance with the PCI DSS.<p>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an industry standard for anyone who stores, processes or transmits cardholder data (think: credit card numbers).  The standard itself covers 12 key requirements for protecting cardholder data with many sub-requirements under each section.<p>All organizations that store, process, or transmit cardholder data are required to be compliant with the PCI DSS.  Based on certain elements, primarily including transaction volume, will determine an organizations ""level"".  Every level is required to comply with the same requirements, but each level may have a different requirement to validate their compliance.  Typically, larger organizations are required to have an onsite audit conducted and smaller organizations are able to self-assess.",1272911217

Price is determined by the intersection of what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to accept in payment.<p>Now, the cost to produce, as well as the production rate (in relation to the consumption rate at a given price) may well feed into the seller's decision about what they're willing to accept. But that's a second-order effect. Sellers charge what buyers are willing to spend. They'll make more of it if there's a good profit to be made; if nobody will pay very much, they'll invest their money in producing something different.<p>The price that a buyer is willing to pay is influenced by how important is the goal for which he wants to use the product, but also how readily he use an alternate product in substitution for this primary one.<p>Thus, he may be willing to forgo the purchase of a vacation trip, because it's just not worth the money.<p>He might also, in the longer term, substitute different goods. So in a longer time horizon, he might change jobs to one that allows him to telecommute, in order to circumvent gas prices. Or car manufacturers might see that they themselves are having trouble selling gas-guzzlers, and change production to alternate-fueled cars, like electric (whose power is ultimately generated by coal or nuke), or maybe engines fueld by natural gas, or something.<p>So in the big picture, there are many safety valves allow this pressure to be dissipated.",1272910807

There's therefore a lot of incentives for the less-than-ethical to exaggerate numbers that can't easily be independently verified.<p>If you go out the door with hard stats, be prepared for someone else to use those stats and claim they're doing better than you - and their claim will have a bit more verisimilitude because they won't have to guess about <i>your</i> performance.

I know, there's a peak uranium issue as well.<p>On the other hand, Europe and the US now find themselves awash in natural gas, which is a pleasant reversal of where we expected to be a few years ago; and renewable power generation is becoming price-competitive and deployed in sufficient volume to yield economies of scale, so we can reasonably hope for that trend to continue over the next 25 years too.

Why not use the left side for the indicators and remove the `arrow`?<p>Maybe I'm becoming one of the tinfoil hat people, but: They change the controls position and allow the application itself to draw the windicators. Application knows nothing about the controls position or the theme really, so it's possible that ubuntu applications will simply draw on the right. Suddenly people have to patch the applications to use them on another distribution and use themes that match what ubuntu apps try to do...

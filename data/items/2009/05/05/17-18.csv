However, they fail to understand that poor parents love and care about their children and their education just as every parent does, and that their lack of involvement or attendance may be due to working several jobs, unreliable transportation or numerous other factors.""<p>This is probably the best part of the submitted article.

If you want it, go out and get it.</i><p>You seem to think that letting fellow members of your society buy food when they are laid off is a waste of your tax money.  Maybe it is.  The problem is, ""non-socialist"" countries like the US waste plenty of my tax money.  Illegal wars, bridges to nowhere, kickbacks to lobbyist friends, etc.   These things cost <i>way</i> more than ""socialism"", but they don't get the taxpayers any actual benefits.  This worries me more (and is more wasteful) than paying a few kids to play video games all day.<p>If I'm paying taxes, I want to get something out of it.  (As an example, think of how much more free the job market would be if everyone had healthcare regardless of their employer.  People could change jobs without worry of not being able to get the medical care they need.  A freer job market is good for you even if you can afford your own healthcare.)",1241545528
594407,comment,594160,594303,0,0,ATB,,,"Every time the failure of US car makers come up, somebody blames the CAFE Act, environmental laws, having to deal with government regulation, etc. It turns into a veritable blamestorm.<p>The problem is that consumer preferences lead to lots of small (and fuel efficient) cars being bought every year; most of them just happen to be made by non-US companies. The profit margin on smaller cars is smaller, as well (luxury cars have the largest profit margin), but I don't believe that Toyota or Honda are losing money on every Corolla or Civic sold. They also seem to be doing OK in meeting fuel economy laws.<p>The real question is why US automakers don't make competitive small cars. One answer is the cost of labor in the US, but the other answer is that US automakers don't have a compelling process in place that continuously refines a small car until it does what the market wants. Look at the aforementioned Civic, for instance. Its original form came on the market in 1973, and its current larger form in 1996. Even the 70s version had a high build quality and was renowned for its reliability, but every subsequent iteration has, arguably, been refined and worked on to make it more and more palatable to the American market (the European Civics are different, FWIW).<p>Now look at US car makers. Which small US car has been marketed under the same name since the early 70s and refined every few years, meeting market demand and giving consumers what they want? US auto makers seem obsessed with re-badging and re-marketing their cars every few years, often to cover up memories of unsuccessful or embarrassing prior launches. The worst example is perhaps the Ford Taurus, which sold bucketloads in the full-size sedan segment in the 80s and 90s. So of course Ford took the Taurus out of their segment in '04 and replaced it with a smaller AND a larger sedan (the Fusion and the 500). Imagine Honda discontinuing the Accord next year and replacing it with a larger AND a smaller sedan (rather than making the Accord a bit larger, which they did last year... and five years ago). To nobody's surprise, the 500 flopped and was hastily renamed back to 'Taurus' for the '09/'10 year (there were some technical reasons, too).<p>Similarly, there are car production plants on US soil that make perfectly good cars, using non-unionized American workers. If you've ever been to, say, Louisville, KY, everybody seems to be driving a Camry.",1241545485

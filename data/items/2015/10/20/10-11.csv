Entire books are written about that. There are much better ways than our current CA model. But <i>we don&#x27;t need any of them</i> to have passively secure transport, over which we can then negotiate authenticity.<p>This is arranging deck chairs on the Hindenburg.

Accountability is a percentage of electrical signals, originated from frontal cortex, that caused the action in question. That&#x27;s why children, mentally ill and even women on PMS are less accountable - less of the electrical signals originated in frontal cortex.<p>Now, since we have cleared out what a &quot;choice&quot; is and there is no more argument about that, it is easy to show that frontal cortex output is determined by input that are prior experience (or electrical signals coming in), genetics (how it reacts to them and how it is initially wired) and chemical environment (drugs/hormones/others). So there&#x27;s no room for any kind of free will.<p>So as you see there is no conflict between lack of free will and morals/ethics.

Researching a company in-depth is a good idea before an interview, but when you're just applying to a company, the cover letter shouldn't take more than about 15 minutes to research and put together.<p>For me, I prefer to keep my cover letter to three paragraphs.  One explains how I found the company and what job opening I'm applying for.  One explains a little of my background.  One explains why I think I'd be a good fit for the company and the job opening.  If I know the person that will be receiving the cover letter, I address them directly, otherwise I come up with a generic salutation or sometimes leave the salutation off all together.<p>I like to keep the cover letter short enough to read in a few seconds while having enough information to let the person that initially goes through the resumes easily determine whether or not I'm a good candidate.",1275573481

His code does that, but it does need two pointers (the one passed in, and the one created to keep track of secondary position) in order to traverse the string.<p>Because the resulting string will only be shorter (never longer), this works.  You simply keep track of where you're copying to and where you're copying from, and move character by character until you reach the end.  The resulting string may have extra stuff at the end, but since it's null terminated the standard C string functions will not see that cruft as they will stop at the first null.",1275573374

Years of Java apparently can't wash away C.<p>As in the article, I started simple and condensed to the version that I actually submitted.  In hindsight, I wonder if that is the best approach when answering an interview question via email.  In person, there's obvious benefit to walking through optimization (of all sorts, including visual), but if all the other party sees is the final version, they lose out on that demonstration of the process.  If you were to receive just the more condensed version from an interviewee, would that be a benefit or detriment to the person?  Does it make sense to send an analysis, or is that just risking overwhelming the interviewer?<p>I've asked for non-specific code samples in interviews before and that did serve to weed out an applicant once, but only because they sent on very easily searched for code (public API example code from a big developer).

We could apportion blame in a number of ways but that wouldn't really help prevent a situation like this arising again.<p>There are three main actors in this case:<p>- The university that charged huge tuition fees for a course in Religious and Women's Studies.
- The financial companies that loaned the huge sums of money needed to pay for those fees.
- The poor girl who took out the loans to pay the tuition.<p>One could criticise the university either for charging such expensive tuition fees or for failing to provide advice that the girl needed. However, you could also argue that the university was acting in its own (financial) self interest. That self interest would have been damaged if the girl had gone to a cheaper university.<p>One could criticise the companies that loaned the girl the money, money that they must have known she would spend a lifetime repaying. However, again, they acted in their own financial self interest, knowing that they'd probably get their money one way or another.<p>One could also criticise the girl but the article makes it clear that she thought that she was acting in her own self interest by getting a degree that she thought would be of great help to her career.<p>Many commenters here have suggested that either the girl could have benefited from better advice when choosing a degree course (which would have helped her to better act in accordance with her self interest) or that student loans should be dischargeable under bankruptcy (which would be an incentive not to loan to students who would find it impossible to pay the loan off).<p>How about a third option, give the university an incentive that is better aligned with the interests of the student after graduation: instead of charging large tuition fees up front, a university could instead say ""in exchange for getting a degree from us, you owe us a certain percentage of all of your future income."" A lot of people are prepared to voluntarily give a tenth of their income to the church so why not to your alma mater? I guess it would be the equivalent of selling ""shares"" in yourself to the university rather than taking out a loan.<p>I'm sure there are a million reasons why this wouldn't be workable but it would be rather wonderful if the interests of the university and the student could be aligned in this way.",1275571500

Microsoft created a direct competitor to Flash called Silverlight.  Adobe didn't intentionally make Flash 10 slower on your computer than Flash 9, just as nVIDIA's latest driver didn't intentionally break my Starcraft 2.  Adobe will work with any platform to get Flash running.<p>I believe Adobe's developers are incompetent.  They had a product leading rich content on the web and failed to ""finish"".  All they had to do was make it stable across all operating systems (how many years have they had?).  Adobe failed but cursing the technology to the grave seems immature considering what advancements we've made because of it.  Like it or not HTML5 cannot completely replace Flash and going backwards in technology will not happen.<p>""We should be rejoicing at their death because they represent the old internet. The closed fucked up internet that ate people's productivity and innovation"" -- seriously, Flash ate productivity and innovation?  Did you SEE the web 10 years ago?  Why is this getting upvoted?",1275570207

They can run all the newest software still, it's 99% the same API as Vista and W7. Plus XP is still faster than Vista or W7, uses less memory and FAR less disk space to do the same functionality.<p>Don't confuse the need to sell more software with the previous version not actually being outdated. There's a huge difference between Windows 3.1 being extinct and XP.",1275570143

They're often rude and uncivil to people of perceived lower status in real life, but because of their status don't expect that same tone to be reciprocated. They dislike the internet, because in general the clues about status aren't as clear, and thus they get talked to just like everyone else.",1275570129
1401149,comment,1399450,1399450,0,0,jhollingworth,,,"Hi my father is a doctor and I sent him a link to this blog asking if he knew what might be wrong, here's his response:<p>He has classical chronic fatigue syndrome, on the same continuum as fibromyalgia and 'ME'. The best term is 'syndrome of central sensitisation'. ""Gulf war syndrome, yuppie flu etc are all part of the same spectrum. It is akin to phantom limb pain.<p>The problem lies in the brain, in the area of the brain that processes incoming sensory information before it presents it to consciousness, which is where we all live. Our brains have the capacity to turn up sensation in the short term to help us respond appropriately to a threat: for example people report that in a road traffic accident everything becomes vivid, and time slows down. This normally turns down after the threat passes. If the threat is severe enough, the memory may keep coming back in flashbacks and nightmares, and the person suffers anxiety and panic attacks. This is post-traumatic stress disorder.<p>Some people develop the syndrome of central sensitisation after a major stress (I had a superfit tree surgeon, a felled tree landed on him but not a branch hurt him, but afterwards he developed severe generalised pain , couldn't sleep and was exhausted. He never worked again).<p>The more common group are people who have major childhood threats, such as early bereavement, parental violence, bullying , sexual abuse etc. It seems their brains become hard-wired in adolescence to be in a permanent state of this hyper-vigilence. All they need is a 'second hit' later in life, some emotional or physical problem, and the whole process is triggered: central sensitisation ensues as a permanent problem. It's like a radio with the volume turned up too loud: there's nothing wrong with the signal or the radio, but the noise it makes is intolerable.<p>In fact, sophisticated research tools have demonstrated chemical, electrical, blood flow changes and on functional MRI in sufferer's brains. In fact, there are physical changes to the brain in PTSD, with atrophy of the hippocampus.<p>Listening to these unfortunate people is fascinating, because it is clear their suffering is so great and real, and it gives us insight into the variety of experiences that human beings endure. A character in The Tempest remarked how beautiful the island was - it is so sweetly perfumed and the waves breaking on the shore make such sweet music - whereas his companion said ' It stinks like a fen.'<p>Treatment is far from satisfactory, especially for protracted severe cases.",1275570096

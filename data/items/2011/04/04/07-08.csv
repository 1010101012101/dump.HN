Prior to seeing it, I'd decided that, for me, the real 'test' of whether I could consider this a genuine sequel would be in the landscapes...<p>Tron came out in 1982. Ken Perlin won an Academy award for his work on the procedurally generated textures (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise</a>) used in the movie.<p>The Mandelbrot set (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set</a>) got widespread fame in August 1985, with that famous Scientific American cover. Tron <i>just missed</i> that graphical opportunity! So, I figured, any true student of CGI involved in the sequel would relish the notion of putting some sort of tribute to Mandelbrot into the scenery (here are some examples: <a href=""http://www.fractalforums.com/3d-fractal-generation/heightfields-using-meshes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fractalforums.com/3d-fractal-generation/heightfie...</a>).<p>How mistaken I was... Yes, I'm really bitter about producers and artists who don't care to know anything about the history of their art. And they had the presumption to call it 'Tron Legacy'??",1301903924

Interactive Design is the greater study of how both product, UX, and visual communications design all factor into the development of technologically based products. One of the ones that has been getting a lot of attention recently is the Interactive Design undergraduate major being newly offered at California College of the Arts (CCA) - great school. Some info:<p>About the Interaction Design Program\nCCAs Interaction Design Program will prepare students to create meaningful and innovative designed experiences in the realms of work, lifestyle, and playfrom computers and mobile devices to interactive physical spaces, games, and social networks.<p>By learning investigative research, systemic thinking, creative prototyping, and hands-on building, Interaction Design students will be prepared to succeed and lead in this exciting field. Students develop technical skills (wireframes, flows, visuals, motion) for interactive canvases such as mobile, desktop, car, game console, film, sculpture, clothes, and buildings. The possible applications extend to numerous industries, from business to entertainment, education, and health.<p>Program Leadership\nDr. Kristian Simsarian, cofounder of the Software Experiences Practice at IDEO and adjunct professor in CCAs Graduate Program in Design, has been tapped to chair the new program. He commented, Surprisingly, there is not yet a consistent source for talent in this field. CCA, with its interdisciplinary environment, impressive facilities, and great location at the hub of the digital world, is the ideal place to build a world-class interaction design program. I am thrilled to be leading this effort. My passion in education is to be a guide for students to create the future from their own insightful, well-informed, and personally inspired visions.<p>Silicon Valley Connections\nCCAs Interaction Design Program was created with input from thinkers at Google, YouTube, Apple, Intel, Nokia, and IDEO. Such companies, as well as nonprofit organizations, will take part in vibrant exchanges with students through sponsored studios and other project-based courses. Students will also have internship opportunities, enabling them to gain professional work experience and contacts, and to define their individual pathways to their future careers.",1301903824

But I've been around a lot of online communities, for a lot of years, and there is one thing that I have noticed.  The key to sustaining quality seems to be barriers to entry.<p>It doesn't much matter what the barrier is.  A commenting system that crashes and destroys conversations occasionally, driving away people who are not sufficiently invested.  A focused remit that drives away most people who see the site.  A small group that does not advertise.  But I've never seen any community sustain itself in a form that I want to be part of without some barrier to limit who gets involved in that community.<p>I'm not entirely clear on what the reasons are.  Is it that we can only track a certain number of people?  Is it that communities can only sustain themselves if turnover stays low?  I don't know.  But I've observed the rule in multiple places.<p>Given that, I've been surprised at how well HN held up.  It started with a good seed.  People who find pg interesting have a reasonably focused remit.  The site lacks a lot of silly bells and whistles.  People mostly find out about it through word of mouth.  But still in the end without some barrier to entry, any sense of community is doomed.  At least if my experience/opinions/etc is accurate.",1301903044

2405751,comment,2405364,2405364,2,0,chad_oliver,,,"Some groundwork: why do we have governments? To allow us to live in peace with people we've never met before, who we could otherwise kill, rape, and steal from, without consequences. It's a giant machine to enforce the golden rule, ""treat others how you'd like to be treated"". Of course, governments do a lot of extra things, but they're just that, extra.<p>The socio-political landscape has changed a lot since the 1700's. I think the biggest difference now is that nations are much less homogeneous than they used to be. In america in the 1700's there was a dominant faith that provided a set of common standards, e.g. that murder, homosexuality, and theft were all wrong. This is no longer the case, and people have become polarized around many different issues. Technology allows us to become convinced of the rightness of our own cause, through association with like-minded individuals.<p>Another significant change is that people are much more likely to move around the country, and have friends and family in different states and countries. Using geography as the basis for government divisions (counties, states, nations) is still a good idea, but is becoming less and less so every day.<p>The conventional solution to the first problem is to give more legislative power to the states, so that, for example, people in the bible belt can have more conservative laws and people in California can legalize pot. <i></i>This isn't a long term solution any more<i></i>, because of the second problem.<p>So we have widely-differing views on what should and shouldn't be legal, but we can't just tailor certain laws to certain geographical areas.<p>Given these factors, I make the following recommendations:<p>* Remove the states, and combine the Senate and House of Representatives into one. Allow cities and counties to control any and all issues that are linked to specific locations.<p>* Stop legislating morality. Enforcing the Truth (by any definition) isn't part of the government's core purpose. I personally believe that abortion is murder (although in a certain subset of cases it is justified), but this is an issue that comes down to personal conviction. It is therefore out of scope for the government. Theft, on the other hand, should remain illegal because it is demonstratively bad for social stability.<p>* All laws should be subject to rigorous logical and scientific analysis. For example, if a particular trade policy cannot be proven to have a net positive impact on the happiness of people, it should not pass.<p>* This would involve setting up a fourth branch of government, which is responsible for collating and evaluating scientific data, and performing the analysis of proposed laws. This branch, like the judicial branch, would have the power to veto laws. I envision that for every law, a formal scientific proof will be made available to the public. This will provide a degree of public accountability.<p>We now have a system in which bad laws (hopefully) won't get passed the scientific analysis, so the negative impacts of populism (rule by the popular) is decreased. Now, notice that the format of congress was decided when we didn't have instant communication. Therefore:<p>* Take away the congressmen, and make parties (rather than people) the fundamental unit. Discussions between parties should take place online, or at least be aggregated online. Copies of the discussions should also be made available at all public libraries.<p>* Allow people to choose a party to represent them, or create their own. Parties will have voting power proportional to their number of supporters (measured in votes, not verbal declarations), and a party must have more than 0.5% of the votes before it gets into congress.<p>* Parties must have a declared high-level policy on every issue, and they will be bound by these policies. This is to prevent people from setting up specific-issue parties; people must learn to support a governance paradigm that is bigger than any specific issue. Note that this does not stop parties from negotiating about details.<p>* Elections at the moment are a sham, so instead have rolling elections. After a person votes for a party, they cannot change their vote for 3 months + (some random number less than 14) days. Note that the random number is different to each person, and changes each time the person changes their vote. Within a few years every day will be equally an election day. The purpose of letting people only vote every 3 months is, again, so that people realize that governance is bigger than their one pet issue.<p>* Any party in congress can propose a law, as can any group of citizens larger than 1% of the population. It passes into law when it (or a later revision) has the support of 50% of the votes in congress, as well as the support of the fourth branch of government.<p>Finally, because we're a global community now, no law will be passed if it steps on the rights of people from other countries, as given in a extended Universal Declaration of Rights. Declarations of war will have to be proven to be beneficial to everyone in the world, not just citizens of the USA. This should hopefully prevent another Vietnam or Iraq.",1301902653

Asia  something that I've given serious thought to doing).  If I stayed here in Manhattan, NYC, I would need at least $10K net/mo.  If I moved to Japan (another place I've considered), I wouldn't need to pay for housing, so I could live on a few K net/ mo.<p>At times in my life, I've had enough money to spend a lot.  I learned an important lesson: the more you spend, the more stuff you get, the more time you spend worrying about where to put that stuff, the more time you spend maintaining or selling that stuff, etc.  Now, I spend my money on travel, food, mortgage, utilities and computers.  My wife buys shoes and clothes, but she's one of those naturally stylish women who makes inexpensive stuff look better than overpriced, tacky name-brand junk.  We aren't frugal, but we are in a sweet spot for spending that is genuinely the comfort zone for us.  I would make a big effort to keep things the same way even if I had a pile of cash in the bank.  The only exception might be some real estate projects, because I like to work on renovations as a hobby.",1301902073

A possible form would be similar to the advertising group/holdings, where each agency has a lot of autonomy.<p>I think it's feasible to do that at Google if the infrastructure group would be spun off as a stand-alone entity (let's call it Google Ops) that can offer resources and consulting to any product group. When a new product is started, it would be similar to a start-up: 3 people in a room in the Googleplex who could choose to work with Google Ops, Amazon EC2, or something else.

I am not routinely inconvenienced by being an American living in Japan with regards to charging for things.  If you're a Nigerian living in Nigeria...  things are going to be a wee bit more difficult.<p>One does not practically or legally <i>need</i> a physical or corporate presence in the US to charge cards.  Of the available options, I use Paypal to charge credit cards -- they had the least involved process to get a Paypal account (Paypal Website Payments standard + Paypal premier account) years ago, and I bootstrapped that into their I-can't-believe-its-not-a-merchant-account (Paypal website payments pro + business account) after a few years of doing (relatively) significant volumes through Paypal proper.  That has been impressively painless.<p>Privilege escalation is, by and large, the easiest way to get into the US banking system.  As soon as you're in a bank's systems and they have their Know Your Customer checkbox ticked next to your application, your odds of not getting held up by fraud review for the next product you add go up <i>greatly</i>.

As soon as you have a foot in the door, everything else gets easier.)<p>Understand that businesses do not refuse to do business with foreigners because they enjoy screwing with you -- it is strictly risk-mitigation.  There are a variety of things you can do to reduce perceived risk.  In general, things which tend to indicate you're a ""real"" business tend to work.

For invention that is truly novel, it is worth the price of temporary monopoly to encourage disclosure. Many of the novel drugs on the market today might not exist without patent protection. It is simply too expensive to create a new drug without the promise of a future upside free from the inevitable copycats, who could underprice because they have no R&D expense.

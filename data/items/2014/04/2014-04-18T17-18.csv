7610361,comment,7608683,7609711,3,0,hagbardgroup,,,"Part of this is because most web media is awful for reading.<p>Column widths are standardized in print, magazine, and books for a reason: to minimize eye movement required. The larger that web screens get, the broader the column lengths often are, which forces more eye movement, which causes eye strain, which requires vision interruption, which impedes reading comprehension.<p>Smart phones are great for short articles because the screens are roughly the width of a newspaper column. It forces the text into an appropriate width, rather than expanding to fit the available monitor space like many websites do.<p>Screens also tend to cause eye strain.<p>Even if you do make pages responsive, chances are that the user will not realize that they should be using a skinny window or that they should shrink the text. Further, commercial web publications tend to optimize for maximized windows to display ads.<p>In print, we have hundreds of years of professional readability and layout experience. On the web we have some cobbled together standards. Most people who are responsible for handling web design aren&#x27;t layout/typography/etc. specialists. So really basic mistakes get made all the time and few people notice them because our knowledge base has effectively eroded because there are so many other priorities to worry about on the web.",1397843894

7610159,comment,7609323,7609323,14,0,danpalmer,,,"Some initial thoughts from looking at the website and documentation...<p>1. The main reason I want SQL is for relational data. The lack of joins basically makes this a &quot;NoSQL&quot; database in every respect except the query language being something resembling SQL. I&#x27;m fairly sure ANSI SQL requires support for joins.<p>2. It does auto-sharding, but I don&#x27;t know how. The documentation doesn&#x27;t specify how the data is sharded, and this is quite important. Range-based sharding, like MongoDB uses by default, is often not what users want (depends on use-case), so if it&#x27;s that, we need to know. Whatever it is, there are trade-offs with different approaches and that&#x27;s something users need to take account of.<p>3. You can&#x27;t change the shard cluster size after initially sharding. I assume this is a planned feature, but until then, it&#x27;s probably not ready for production use.<p>4. You can only shard on the primary key, if you have a primary key.<p>5. The configuration for the number of replicas is confusing, and appears to not be very configurable.<p>A brief read makes this seem to be basically MongoDB from its early days, with many of the disadvantages, but some advantages like custom analysers which appear to replace Mongo&#x27;s map reduce, that can be queried by an SQL-like syntax.<p>When I saw this, I thought it was going to be a relational database that did auto-sharding and replication. That would have been great. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not. It might become that a few years down the line, but right now, I&#x27;m not inspired by it.",1397841959

The poor sod who was responsible for it and our one other Rails application, our one and only Rails developer, finally managed to move on to other things.<p>At this point, security issues and (most likely) the inability to slather on new features have percolated up the chain of command and it has been agreed that Something Must Be Done. Since the upgrade path seems to recapitulate the phylogeny of Rails, our options seem to be to rewrite the applications in a modern Rails and kick the can down the street, hoping it&#x27;ll work better this time, or rewrite it using our common tools around here (and because I&#x27;ve got something to do with it, in the simplest manner possible).

7610033,comment,7609205,7609205,9,0,Jemaclus,,,"If I understand things correctly, what they&#x27;re basically saying is that the utilities can smooth out energy consumption across the entire grid. For instance, instead of everyone having the AC on for the first 10 minutes of every hour, they can turn 1/6 of the ACs on for the first 10 minutes, then turn those off and turn on the next 1/6 for the next 10 minutes, and so on. If that&#x27;s the case, then instead of a huge spike (say, 80%) at the top of the hour and a huge dip (say, 10%) for the rest of the hour, the energy usage will be more constant across the whole hour (25% for the whole hour).<p>This should, in theory, reduce utilities costs in general, which ideally would be passed on to the consumers. And since everyone&#x27;s Nest thermostat is already turning the AC up for 10 minutes, then the consumer isn&#x27;t spending/losing any money on this -- they were already doing this, it&#x27;s just at a different time that helps the utilities companies.<p>I think that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re talking about.

11069125,comment,11065067,11067478,0,0,lorenzhs,,,"A hypothetical optimal bloom filter-like data structures needs -log₂ ε bits per key as noted in [1]. For the absolutely arbitrary value ε=0.25 that&#x27;s 2 bits per key (so 2n bits), and you need that t times. Or if you do it directly with a higher success probability, say, 10^-6 then it&#x27;s 20 bits per element. That&#x27;s more than half of the input size, assuming 32 bit keys. The approach I wrote about uses O(log₂ p) = O(log₂ (n/ε)) bits, or put differently: a constant number of integers. Bloom filters are awesome (and I know HN loves them) but this isn&#x27;t a good application for them.<p>Sorting in-place would be a neat trick, you&#x27;d have to store the t integers, but as I showed t=30 is more than enough. That&#x27;s 30 ints, again way less than a Bloom filter.<p>Re: position information, I&#x27;d consider that linear space too (measured in machine words). It&#x27;s a good idea but keep in mind that if the input was in a random order, these are n accesses to completely random memory locations. Due to the way virtual memory is implemented (TLB misses are commonly resolved using a B-Tree data structure to prevent timing attacks), they actually take closer to log n time. There&#x27;s an older paper that shows that this takes roughly the same time as sorting the input. I believe it was in [2] somewhere. Huge pages might mitigate this nowadays.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Alternatives"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Alternatives</a> - citation goes to Pagh, Anna; Pagh, Rasmus; Rao, S.

You have a limited number of spots at Harvard and Stanford every year, and >10x the applicants for each spot.

Many students apply to these schools because their prestige and rank and the schools can therefore be selective of their student body.<p>Admissions at Harvard or Stanford doesn&#x27;t use a random number generator to determine admissions after a &#x27;meets minimum requirements&#x27; filter.

Basically what the paper does is that it defines operators for ρ, j, E based on the hindsight knowledge of Maxwell&#x27;s equations and non-relativistic equation of motion for a particle; then it shows that it is possible to have both sets as Heisenberg equations. That&#x27;s definitely <i>not</i> something a physicist would call deriving Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Most of the thing claimed to be derived in the title is actually defined/assumed, the result is merely that the Heisenberg formalism, the commutation relations and non-relativistic equation of motion do not seem incompatible.

And yes, they both absolutely need to know how an IC engine works.<p>Yes, tools are doing their job, yes they will only keep getting better and I want them to keep getting better. But that is no excuse to not know how they work, and what are the tradeoffs of using one over the other. e.g. There are plenty of ORMs for PHP. Why would you use one over the other? If one ORM generates more efficient queries at the cost of some programming discomfort, I&#x27;d much rather have you choose that.<p>By definition, tools solve generic use-cases. i.e. you can get away with tools as long as you&#x27;re solving simplistic generic problems that have been solved before. But the moment you transcend that boundary and need to do anything custom, especially at scale, you will totally need to know how things work under the hood. You may still end up modifying an existing tool, but you&#x27;ll only do a good job at it when you understand the insides.<p>Also, the urge to look under the hood is simply a proxy to curiosity. That is exactly what starts to separate better  engineers from mediocre ones.<p>[About me: <a href=""http://InterviewKickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://InterviewKickstart.com</a>]",1455054705

So they are very good at measuring the amount of time that has passed between two events, but not as great for telling you exactly what time an event happened.<p>The other problem is that there&#x27;s not really such thing as a single, true time. Precision timekeeping is one of those places where relativity matters -- differences in altitude and the geology of the earth under your feet at a particular point change how fast any particular clock &#x27;ticks&#x27;.<p>So to accommodate these differences, if you want events to be synchronized across multiple locations over a long period, you both need a single agreed-upon &quot;current time&quot;, and some way to get information about that time information to the sites that need it.<p>You could surely do this with directly connected wires that were very carefully measured, but that gets expensive very quickly. The GPS system already requires super-precise time just to function, so it makes for a great distribution mechanism of &quot;what time is it&quot; information, where the people running the GPS system are bothered with all the details of figuring out and standardizing a single time, and you &#x27;just&#x27; have to listen.<p>The GPS folks also keep track of things like how fast the GPS standard clock is drifting from the UTC standard clock (since no two clocks will agree over the long term, period). And this is actually where the problem happened -- Two of the parameters broadcast (A0 and A1) were incorrect, and it&#x27;s these parameters that are used to specify the current time difference between the GPS master clock and the UTC master clock (the GPS master clock is disciplined to be as close to UTC as possible, but is always off by a minute amount, and that&#x27;s what A0/A1 represent).<p>Pretty much it boils down to, much as it is in distributed systems, &quot;there is no now&quot;.

11069003,comment,11063470,11068519,0,0,haberman,,,"I have another similar story! This one kind of blows my mind.<p>In 1978, Corpus Christi College in Oxford, England was being renovated, which involved breaking down a wall that had been standing for centuries.  When they broke open this wall, they found that there was a leaf from a manuscript dating to the 16th century.  It had been stuffed in there as a sort of building material.<p>On this leaf was music, which was quickly identified as being a fragment of a piece by Thomas Tallis (c.1505 - 1585) called <i>Gaude Gloriosa</i>.  The piece is known because it survives in other sources.  It&#x27;s pretty popular among music from the period and several recordings of it have been made in the last 50 years.<p>But what was unexpected is that the text on this leaf was not the same text as we have in the other sources.  This text was in English instead of Latin.  Clearly the composer had reworked his piece to fit a different text.  But what was this other text?  Nobody knew, and the pages they found in this wall were highly incomplete, so they only had a small fragment of this alternate text.<p>The mystery wasn&#x27;t solved until just last year (2015).  A British scholar named David Skinner typed the fragmentary text into Google, and out popped an excerpt from a book.  It turns out the author of the text is Henry VIII&#x27;s sixth and last wife, Katherine Parr.  37 years after the discovery of the leaf, and almost 500 years after the actual event, Google allowed scholars to connect the dots on this mystery.<p>(I&#x27;m not 100% sure whether the search that revealed the mystery came from Google books or the regular Google search, since the scholar who did the search didn&#x27;t specify. But since the complete works of Katherine Parr are on Google Books (<a href=""https://books.google.com/books/about/Katherine_Parr.html?id=cBzuka1QBKkC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books/about/Katherine_Parr.html?id=...</a>), it seems likely that it was a Google Books search.)<p>By the way, this whole story is being published in an upcoming paper called: ‘Deliuer me from my deceytful ennemies&#x27;: A Tallis Contrafactum in Time of War.  The abstract is available here: <a href=""http://www.tudorpartbooks.ac.uk/media/sites/researchwebsites/tudorpartbooks/Abstracts_Tallis.docx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tudorpartbooks.ac.uk/media/sites/researchwebsites...</a> (scroll to the bottom)",1455054140

One quote in particular stuck with me &quot;few students are accepted to Yale but almost all graduate&quot;. What exactly did he expect? Why would admissions accept people they think are unlikely to be successful? The whole article is written as if candidates are chosen by a simple dice roll, uniformly taken across the population (mirroring those who now have access via the internet).<p>The value, from an employment standpoint at the very least, is not what you learned in school, but the reasons you were selected to participate in the community doing the learning.  The elite institutions spend considerable time and expense collecting a curated group of top performers to a single location.  From a creative and developmental perspective this is huge for the students. From a signalling perspective this huge for employers.<p>My prediction, perhaps as laughably misguided as I think this article is, is that the paridime shift will come from employers. As taboos against training wear away, and groups begin to see how much cheaper it can be to hire and train high school graduates the demand for college graduates will abate. This probably won&#x27;t effect the Columbias, or the Yales of the world, but will likely eliminate most of the hugely expensive less prestigious institutions.",1455054074

When I started really going heavy, I was going through a heartbreak and wanted to throw my efforts into something other than wallowing in self-misery. I kept it up even after I pulled out of it. Never let a good heartbreak go to waste.<p>My routine evolved slowly over time. The key is spotting and removing barriers to doing more. I put my jacket on the machine on the left, my towel goes on the right. My iPhone goes in the cup holder, my gym bag just under the cup holder. My gym bag has an organization scheme, everything in there has a place and there&#x27;s a routine for putting everything there before I get in my car.<p>Basically, every little thing I can look at and try to improve, I do, and don&#x27;t worry about the time or expense. I&#x27;ve gone through three pairs of sneakers to try to find the right kind that won&#x27;t hurt the balls of my feet. Cheap ones don&#x27;t work well, so I&#x27;m moving on to New Balance. I had minimalist shoes, those hurt my feet, but not enough to where I can&#x27;t work out. The shoes have to be 8 1/2 or 9 wide, normal doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>My music routine has shifted over time. I used to just play anything, then I went to a specific playlist so I could try HIIT. Whenever the chorus would come on, I&#x27;d go really hard. That got unsustainable as my times on the machine went up and now I just do it flat, with my whole playlist so I don&#x27;t get bored of the music. Maybe in six months to a year I&#x27;ll be able to experiment with it again.<p>The machine itself has settings, my approach to these have refined over time as well. I used to set the incline all the way to 20 and slowly increase the resistance over time. Now I set both the incline and the resistance as I&#x27;m comfortable and just trust that over time my body will adjust and the numbers will go up.<p>The key to getting started, I think, is to pick something that can be &quot;routine-ized&quot;. I use a machine instead of running because I have a lot more &#x27;knobs&#x27; to tweak. Classes I have to take on someone else&#x27;s schedule, I used to do dance classes but not anymore. I tried the bike machine when I first started going to the gym but gravitated to the Arc machine pretty quickly and fell in love with it.<p>At first the big battle will be just showing up. I started with the simple goal of going there once every day. Didn&#x27;t matter if I actually worked out or not, or what I did, just get to the gym that day and I gave myself permission to feel like I&#x27;m accomplishing my fitness goals.<p>Then when it starts getting hard, I gave myself permission to fall back to earlier goals as needed / desired. I can cut workouts short, but not skip them. I always make sure I&#x27;m moving forward.<p>There finally comes a point where moving forward is moving backward. You don&#x27;t want working out to overtake the rest of your life. But you have to cut back with purpose, not just do it because of reasons. You can put it on the back burner, but know why you&#x27;re doing that and when you&#x27;re ready to put it back on the front burner.<p>I&#x27;m injured right now, so I&#x27;m allowing other things to take priority.

And then came Twitter, which was yet another centralized, proprietary service.<p>When has an open, decentralized product or service <i>ever</i> supplanted a centralized, closed, proprietary one?  Never, that I can think of.  Linux never replaced Windows, not for the vast majority of users.  It did become very popular for servers, but really it took over from proprietary UNIX there, and really created its own market because back in the early 90s there was no such thing as a webserver; the whole use-case is different with Linux on servers.  So UNIX was never really entrenched in exactly the things that Linux servers are used for now.  Then there&#x27;s smartphones and embedded devices like that, but there again Linux really created its own market; before Linux, small devices generally didn&#x27;t have enough power to run a heavyweight OS like Linux.  Android (semi-open, uses Linux) came about pretty much simultaneously with the iPhone.  So here again, there wasn&#x27;t some single proprietary thing that was dominant and entrenched in a mature market.  There&#x27;s the Apache webserver, but here again, there was no big dominant proprietary player.  LibreOffice hasn&#x27;t had much success in supplanting MS Office.  MySQL is very popular, but here again there was no dominant proprietary web database; MySQL created that market (though PostgreSQL has become a serious competitor to it, but it&#x27;s also open).<p>So in summary, the only time I&#x27;ve seen open, non-proprietary solutions win out is when the environment changed, frequently because of their presence and availability, making them the natural pick.  I&#x27;ve never seen them beat out an entrenched dominant player in a mature market.  So I definitely don&#x27;t expect to see it happen with Facebook.  What I could see happening is something coming up which uses a non-proprietary or decentralized system which creates a whole new market, rendering one of those things obsolete.  I have no idea what that could be though, but then again 20 years ago I wouldn&#x27;t have imagined that people would want to spend massive amounts of time on a &quot;social network&quot; sharing inane pictures and videos and making idiotic comments to each other about them.",1455053173

11068876,comment,11065933,11067523,0,0,squeaky-clean,,,"(tl;dr, I don&#x27;t think he does)<p>I&#x27;m also not a distributed systems expert, but this is how I interpreted the arguments. AntiRez is responding to the scenario where a client acquires a lock, hangs, a new client acquires a lock, and the old client comes back and tries to write something based off of a now stale lock. As demonstrated in this image [0]<p>So the random token ensures that even though many clients may &quot;think&quot; they have a lock, only up to a single client can ever actually have one. The write in the diagram which corrupts the database shouldn&#x27;t happen, because you&#x27;ll need to check that your lock token matches the service. [1] (excuse the terrible MSPaint modifications).<p>Which covers the common cases of lock timeout. But the clients aren&#x27;t the only part of the system that can violate the mutex. Martin seems to have already thought of this rebuttal:<p><pre><code>    You cannot fix this problem by inserting a check on the lock expiry just before writing back to storage. Remember that GC can pause a running thread at any point, including the point that is maximally inconvenient for you (between the last check and the write operation).\n    [ ... ]\n    If you still don’t believe me about process pauses, then consider instead that the file-writing request may get delayed in the network before reaching the storage service. Packet networks such as Ethernet and IP may delay packets arbitrarily\n</code></pre>\nAnd I don&#x27;t believe AntiRez answers this (or I&#x27;m not understanding when they do :P ). Even if a client makes a write-request at a perfectly valid point in time, when they own the lock, how do I know that by the time the write-request reaches storage, that the lock is still valid? The difference boils down to &quot;redlock guarantees requests are sent during a valid lock&quot;, but not &quot;redlock guarantees requests transact during a valid lock&quot;<p>Martin&#x27;s fix [2] is similar to the token method suggested, except: A) the write-if-token-matches logic is handled directly by the storage layer. B) It uses an auto-incrementing token.<p>He spends a few paragraphs making the point that redlock cannot generate good fencing tokens, because it has no good auto-increment consensus. But I don&#x27;t see how a random token is any worse than an incrementing one if you&#x27;re just going to straight up reject requests where the token doesn&#x27;t match. Antirez addresses this, without addressing A.<p>I would also really like someone to correct me if I&#x27;m missing something. The Redlock implementations are very bare-bones with tests or examples of how to actually use them. The Ruby library has a more &quot;advanced&quot; example, which says this at the point where they try writing to the file system:<p><pre><code>                # Note: we assume we can do it in 500 milliseconds. If this\n                # assumption is not correct, the program output will not be\n                # correct.\n</code></pre>\nWhich doesn&#x27;t give me good faith in this...<p>[0] <a href=""http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/unsafe-lock.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/unsafe-lock.png</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/8rezAaX.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/8rezAaX.png</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/fencing-tokens.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/fencing-tokens.png</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/antirez/redlock-rb/blob/master/example2.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/antirez/redlock-rb/blob/master/example2.r...</a>",1455052895

One of the reasons the green line is so overcrowded is because so many people work on that line. It&#x27;s not only about where people live. If you put people next to the E, it doesn&#x27;t mean they only take the E.<p>First, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the case. Most of the jobs in Manhattan are in midtown and downtown. Downtown all the lines converge and in midtown there&#x27;s multiple crosstown subways. Sure if you work at Hunter College you have to take the Lexington line, but that&#x27;s a relatively small number of people.<p>Second, inasmuch as its about where you work rather than where you live it doesn&#x27;t matter whether or not you put new housing in Manhattan. If you put it in Jersey City or Brooklyn you still need to get those people to work. A moritorium on new housing in the entire metro area is a non-starter. So from that POV, you might as well put them in Manhattan.<p>--<p>Certainly though I agree that Albany and Washington should quit ripping us off so hard and that the MTA should be less dysfunctional.

In the example you mention Reddit the company is basically tieing it&#x27;s entire existence to Google&#x27;s adtech. If google suddenly decides it wants to come out with a competitor and shuts down Reddit&#x27;s access to the adnetwork, the games over for them as a company. They have no ability to build 1-1 relationships with advertisers because they aren&#x27;t one of the big players?<p>This also seems like something ripe for abuse. You use Google&#x27;s AdNetwork because it&#x27;s the only way to access revenue for advertisements. But google can keep upping the cost of it and companies are left with no choice but to pay it or fold up shop.<p>Maybe this is a good thing and companies shouldn&#x27;t be relying on ad revenue.

Once its created, users can scroll around the map and/or perform tag & category based search to find channels they&#x27;re interested in like yours, subscribe to that channel, and immediately group chat with you and all other subscribed users. Channels are therefore just location based posts with an embedded anonymous group chat.<p>How is it different: \n- Most social apps require email, usernames, passwords and sometimes other information. This app is meant to be as anonymous as possible, so all we ask is for you to set a username, if and only if, you wish to chat with others or subscribe. - Channels was created to be simple and anonymous so we have no menus or ads or hidden ways to make money; just 3 screens that you can swipe between. - Rather than stick with the norm of comment based communication like other social platforms, we are chat based so each channel is actually a conversation. Just as if this was a messaging app, you can go between channels to chat with different people from all over the world anonymously about anything. - Channels is community driven. We made this app for the community so all posts are by real people, not bots or sponsored data. Upon request we can change this to add more features, but for now we want to make sure everything is community created.",1455051968

There is no reason to assume that.<p>Original comment:\nIs this really not obvious to people?  It&#x27;s about subtended angles - simple geometry.  As the Earth&#x27;s distance from a star increases, it subtends a decreasing angle in that star&#x27;s &quot;sky.&quot;  Assuming radiation does indeed proceed radially and in straight lines, at increasing distance the Earth is capable of catching a decreasing portion of that star&#x27;s radiation.  As the distance approaches infinity, the subtended angle approaches zero and the amount of light reaching us approaches zero.  The star is just as bright, but most of its radiation goes somewhere else besides Earth.<p>Imagine building a giant spherical shell around a star.  Its radius equals the distance between earth and the star.  It catches 100% of that star&#x27;s radiated energy.  Now paint the Earth on the inside of the shell, actual size.  It looks, to someone standing on the surface of that star, like the real earth, i.e. a tiny dot.  Now divide the surface area of the dot, by the surface area of the sphere (4)(pi)(r^2).  That&#x27;s how much of that star&#x27;s energy our planet catches.  Assuming zero degradation across space.<p>So imagine you&#x27;re in a forest of trees the closest of which are 800 miles away from you.  You&#x27;d see the goddamned sky just fine.",1455051664

The explanation is correct as far as it goes, but failing to take expansion into account either dates the explanation or fails to evaluate a factor that&#x27;s a bit more complex than relying on the finite age of the universe.",1455051648

Windows 8 is actually incredibly solid, fast, and has a ton of great tools available.<p>SSH on Windows works just as well as OS X, and sleep / resume etc is a solved problem, with the added bonus that you can run any game that comes out.  For a developer who wants to focus on getting things done, it isn't that Windows 8 is so much more compelling than OS X, but the price and compatibility make it worth using.",1367099957

I believe it wasn't a double touch, but rather would detect what side of the mouse you were touching at the time. (This required you to lift up your left finger to do a right click, which was pretty dumb.) Not too long after, every Mac portable started shipping with trackpads that interpreted a two-finger click as a right click. The idea that Jobs never changed his mind on this is pretty obviously wrong.",1367099957

She eats a lot (97th percentile height and weight), and there is no way pumping just twice a day would be enough. She tried to breastfeed and pump from day one, and it would take her forever just to get a couple of ounces out.<p>The baby still wakes up to eat twice at night, and I take the night feedings. It's a huge benefit for us to be able to do that, because my wife needs 6-7 hours of uninterrupted sleep to function the next day, while I don't. As for other chores, they're trivial and easily outsourced. If I couldn't take on some of the feedings, I just wouldn't be carrying my weight.<p>And for a career woman, starting out from day 1 with the husband taking a lesser role in child-rearing is a sure way to become the primary care giver and the one who will ultimately have to downshift if push comes to shove.<p>I'm glad it works for you, but it would be very inconvenient for us, and given the tenuous medical benefits of doing so it isn't worth it to try and make it work. And I think if doctors encouraged women, especially women with careers, to evaluate the costs and benefits of breastfeeding rationally instead of regurgitating highly unscientific dreck the way they do, a lot more women would bottle feed without feeling guilty about it.<p>What grates on me is that a lot of people who breastfeed make other decisions that endanger their children, totally guilt free. Living in a suburban area where driving is a necessity and it is common for teenagers to drive is going to have more of a practical impact on your child than whether you breastfeed or not.",1367098438

Well if you have an actually decent idea, then it will be even easier for you to raise millions as well.</i><p>I was actually reading a post by Patrick McKenzie the other day and I think his commentary on this was one of the best I've seen. While it's encouraging and optimistic to think like this, the reality is that 90% of the time, mediocrity (or worse) is good enough. One example- most businesses run on poorly-engineered, shitty legacy software systems stitched together over time as a lineage of sucky-to-great programmers have come and gone and inherited each other's garbage amid changing requirements. Early in my career I noticed this and was brazen enough to think that there was obviously a much better way to engineer the software, so why didn't the executives see it? Over time I realized that I was naive- business managers care about increasing revenue and profits. Quality code and engineering doesn't even register on the radar.<p>Incompetence in engineering is just one area of incompetence. It is important to remember that incompetence in selling or networking, while probably a lot harder for one to see in oneself, can be just as detrimental to one's chances of success (perhaps more so).

5619083,comment,5614629,5618354,1,0,hga,,,"Trust us, Lisp was hyped (I worked for ""the other Lisp Machine company"" in the early '80s).  Albeit perhaps not as much as Ada.<p>One big thing to consider about the normal Lisp and Smalltalk implementation style vs. C and Clojure by virtue of it running on top of the JVM (and CLR, and for the Javascript version I hope it inherited a lot of this) is that the former are ""take over the world"" approaches, back in those days and still a lot today (e.g. SBCL) implemented by dumping an image to memory and restoring that when you want to run it.<p>Whereas C is very much a building blocks approach, and within the JVM Clojure is as well.  E.g. for the latter the popular Leiningen tool uses directives like<p><pre><code>  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure ""1.4.0""]\n\n                 [clj-time ""0.4.4""]\n                 [etc.]\n</code></pre>\nAnd known repositories to pick up the corresponding .jar files.  Java and any other language that fits into the JVM ecosystem is an equal player on the JVM with Clojure, and it defers to Java for things the latter already does quite well enough.<p>This sort of approach, which in the case of Java and Clojure is NOT Worse is Better/The New Jersey Way, seems to have survival characteristics.<p>Hard to determine how much this was a factor vs. performance, C being a general purpose portable assembler.  After UNIX(TM) and C grew up on tiny machines, we then largely squeezed into barely larger ones, the 8086 and 68000 based ones when DRAM was still pretty dear.  Or for ""engineering workstations"", I'm told a non-common, although not all that good configuration early on was one Sun with a hard drive and 2-3 diskless ones all sharing the drive.",1367097563

Textile is much worse that Markdown. For example, a single starting space means <pre>. And the link syntax is awful.<p>People understand ""<i>"" and ""_"" very well. Bullets are fairly intuitive. Everything else requires looking at the format code help sheet.<p>My suggestion for a better link syntax is this: Anchor in brackets before </i>or* after the link. So this:<p><pre><code>    [Some link] http://example.com/\n</code></pre>\nand this:<p><pre><code>    http://example.com/ [Some link]\n</code></pre>\nwould both become a link with ""Some link"" as the text. If there are brackets-text both before and after, choose the one after.<p>This is unambiguous for almost all kinds of text, and anyone who is oblivious to the syntax is unlikely to stumble into it by mistake. And it's quite easy to remember, especially since the order is unimportant.<p>You don't need much more than that, because people who really care about formatting are also capable of learning HTML.

Patents can be overbroad (that&#x27;s often what we talk about here on Hacker News) and patents can be for &quot;prior art&quot; already known to other workers (and that&#x27;s what often gets litigated), but in general patents are a helpful public policy, along with copyrights (I think current United States copyright terms are much too long) and trademarks.

Once the bank-to-bank net amounts have been calculated the RBA shuffles around a few numbers in databases to execute all the interbank transfers.<p>It sounds like in the USA banks have to have accounts with each other in order to affect transfers.

Not only that it won&#x27;t cover most private rents inside the M25. The council waiting list is 3-5 years in London so you&#x27;ll have to go into arrears. The only way out is to stop paying your rent and go the council and tell them you are homeless. At which point either you or your children are split up or you get wedged in what I can only describe as a &quot;crackhead den&quot; at best. My other half had to clean the needles away before she could wash in the morning when this happened to her (after she was made redundant and the market was suddenly saturated with her speciality).<p>3.

He will be joined by legal and technical staff members from Patent Calls, as well as selected guest lecturers.</i><p><i>Carefully designed to be a program that will be “Conducted by Experts for Experts,” Boot Camp participants will learn that serving as an expert witness is a unique and productive way to use their technical knowledge. “By their nature, patent trials are highly charged competitive environments for companies and attorneys who have a great deal at stake,” Dr. Rhyne has explained, “and an expert witness is often a key part of that process. I am pleased to have this opportunity to share my experience as a witness with others.”</i><p><i>Patent Calls’ Patent Expert Witness Boot Camp will provide an opportunity for individuals who have some patent expert witness experience – or who are aspiring to become an expert witness – to benefit from both intensive instruction and interactive training that are intended to increase their effectiveness and appeal to potential clients. Participants will receive a highly integrated combination of classroom instruction, team exercises, and simulated examination and testimony that will serve to challenge them and thus maximize their learning experiences.</i><p><a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101115007716/en/Patent-Calls-Hosts-Patent-Expert-Witness-Boot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101115007716/en/Pate...</a><p>Which contrasts nicely with the questions put to Diffie about his status as an expert witness:<p><i>Fenster noted that while Diffie was testifying in court for the first time, he had other expert witness work lined up.

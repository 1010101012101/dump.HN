6121900,comment,6120188,6121012,2,0,gregsq,,,"Actually I&#x27;m staying in a Victorian country town called Castlemaine where there are two supermarkets under the IGA franchise. There are no Coles or other supermarket competitors here that provide the venue for a &#x27;supermarket war&#x27; as its described. I can assure you that the prices I quote are accurate. I&#x27;m also fairly confident that the shelf price for ordinary refined flour white bread would drop significantly if there were competitors.<p>Cheaper options are available in a regional city called Bendigo some 35km away, and I&#x27;ve no doubt that there are even greater discounts available in larger cities.<p>And there&#x27;s the rub. Lack of meaningful competition in many sectors in Australia leads to a kind of price rorting, as I believe it&#x27;s called by the Australian consumer and competition agency.<p>I have no political axe to grind. I&#x27;m merely on the one hand pointing out a price differential observable to any visiting european, and on the other indicating what seems to be an effect of limited competition.<p>Australian prices generally have increased greatly relative to the English pound in my experience. The reasons for that aren&#x27;t that difficult to understand, and ordinary supply demand leads to large regional variations I&#x27;m sure.<p>Australian politics are not my politics, though I presume they&#x27;re yours. I hope I haven&#x27;t stumbled into some local political schism.",1375113596

Sadly, perception matters more than what is actually happening.<p>Also, keep in mind that the real job of management and executives in most companies is reputation management. Their actual purpose is to sustain the reputation of the company so it can trade its wares (produced by the workers) at an advantageous rate. The test of the white-collar peon is how well he supports his manager&#x27;s reputation. That&#x27;s why middle managers are allowed to demand total loyalty of their reports. Above-board work that the manager didn&#x27;t direct ends up minimizing the boss, so any benefit to the company doesn&#x27;t really matter.

Digital images are a big grid of pixels.

This removes all &quot;color&quot;.<p>Sepia is similar but you take three differently weighted averages of the original red, green, and blue values to produce the sepia-red, sepia-blue, and sepia-green values in the result.

6121768,comment,6121219,6121219,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Bad advice. Let me just say that off the bat, before I explain why.<p>One of the most infuriating things about companies is how slow they are when it comes to trusting people. (Actually, they&#x27;re sluggish around all kinds of decisions. Try selling to the enterprise some time.) While companies <i>do</i> value initiative and curiosity in the abstract, the length of time (even in most startups) one has to spend at them is an order of magnitude longer than makes any sense at all.<p>If you&#x27;re 6 months old in a company, but your manager only gets to spend 5% of his time with you (which is more than you&#x27;ll typically get) then, from his perspective, you&#x27;ve been there for 1.3 weeks. You just got there, in his view. This really sucks, because it means a lot of time is wasted on the pokey track by people who feel like they could be advancing a lot faster (and are right).<p>Typically, it takes a couple years before you&#x27;re allowed to show initiative or curiosity, or have opinions. The dues-paying period is a horrible waste of life, but that&#x27;s how human organizations are. I don&#x27;t think anyone has found a cure for it.<p>Being that obnoxious junior programmer is actually a terrible career strategy. Gaining credibility is often more potent than learning; there are a zillion people more capable of doing the top jobs than hold them at a given time, but only a few people acquire the organizational trust. Credibility, not capability, is the limiting factor. Learning general-purpose skills <i>can</i> be more useful than climbing a ladder (it&#x27;s transferrable to the next job) but you don&#x27;t have to step on toes to do that; while learning about an organization is less important than having it learn to trust you. (If you fail and get fired; everything you learned about the organization is useless.)<p>Now, the thing is that when a company is running well and there&#x27;s plenty of work to do, the overperformer who is eagerly seeking work &quot;above his grade&quot; is tolerated. The problem is that, whenever things become a bit more uncertain or it becomes clear that not all peoples&#x27; ambitions will be satisfied, they&#x27;re high-class trophy-fires with giant bulls&#x27;-eyes on their asses. They also tend to get flanked by same-rank colleagues; if there&#x27;s some Little Eichmann out there who can gain managerial approval by showing you up as &quot;distracted&quot;, then watch out. Remember that it will have nothing to do with actual performance, but <i>perception</i>, which is ruined by the above-grade work.",1375112524

Leading to inflated costs, as it has happened in US.<p>So I am against insurance in this form, unless it works like a non-profit cooperative. In fact Dr. Devi Shetty has also innovated here, with a scheme which costs as little as Re. 5 per month (1/60 USD per month) and provides heart coverage to rural Indians. It works as a cooperative scheme of course.<p>I am surprised, Insurance companies, even exist. As they should be the first thing to be replaced by Software (as in &#x27;Software eating the world&#x27; by Marc Andressen)...

That doesn&#x27;t have any real bearing on Chromecast, though, and those devices don&#x27;t have the extensibility that Chromecast does.<p>2) Anything that reduces the amount of hardware I interact with is a net positive, IMO. Also, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;in Android&quot;. Netflix and Pandora are on the web and iOS devices, there is no shortage of ways to find their content. In my experience, browsing YouTube has been a giant PITA on every single device I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d much rather browse videos on my computer and send ones I find to my TV as desired.<p>3) Tab mirroring is in beta, as Google has said, which is not the same as an app streaming directly from the web. (No middleman device required.) It&#x27;s already pretty good, but does need improvement. In the meantime, Netflix - which has &quot;native&quot; support - is great, with none of those issues. The rest are simply good, and will become great once Google improves their mirroring feature.<p>4) That&#x27;s a feature that 95% of users won&#x27;t ever need. If the other dongles you mention do that, fantastic. I&#x27;ll concede that Chromecast isn&#x27;t doing that now, but I think we can agree it&#x27;s definitely not a major selling point. (Not to mention, there&#x27;s no reason someone couldn&#x27;t write a Chromecast app to do something exactly like that. Just because it doesn&#x27;t exist yet doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t.)<p>I play my MKVs from a local Plex server to my Roku ($80). Chromecast ($35) will likely replace that soon, either via the Plex Web Client (which organizes all my media in a nice, friendly format, no ugly directory tree browsing required) or a &quot;native&quot; app. Plus, a remote control <i>is</i> extra hardware. I&#x27;m never more than 5 feet from my phone, and I regularly lose my TV remotes.<p>Those dongles you linked to seem to be running Google TV. Chromecast runs a stripped down version of Chrome OS. Two sides of the same coin, but Chromecast is far more integrated and extensible. Seems worthy of some praise to me.",1375111083

GameBoy was waaaay ahead of its time and had no APIs for developing.<p>The same is true today: If you want to get ahead of the market, you can take the hit in complexity and develop for a lower-level of hw/sw, like the Parallela, in exchange for a short-term advantage, but there&#x27;s no mainstream market yet.  Or, you can write a great iOS app today, but you won&#x27;t be the first.

Sometimes, I find it an attractive first approximation.<p>However, I recognize that my dog, Scarlett, is an animal and therefore to a first approximation an insect. Yet, I do not squash her when she&#x27;s in the bed with me, nor spread chemicals to prevent her entry to the house, nor scrupulously remove all potential food sources.<p>We agree that there is an endless supply of HN submissions. Though we may disagree about which is which, we also agree that some are better and some are worse. We also agree that there is virtually no barrier to entry in regards to becoming a supplier of articles to HN.<p>The points at which I find dissonance in the market model are:<p>() The supply of karma points is also unlimited. I can create a karma point for another HN&#x27;er. Of course, I can destroy a karma point for another HN&#x27;er, but only to a more limited degree; at least I understand that there&#x27;s throttling in the software.<p>() Karma points are not fungible. I cannot exchange them for anything - except in a limited sense snark that I am willing to have downvoted, a practice in which I have occasionally engaged.<p>() Thus, if there is a market of the sort amenable to economic market theories, it is the sort of market which is for all practical purposes entirely illiquid. I don&#x27;t know enough economic theory to suggest that such markets are not the subject of voluminous academic research, but supposing they are, that perhaps still suggests dubiousness in the first order approximation.<p>Teasing out the interesting facts about HN requires, in my opinion, a better abstraction.<p>I prefer a political model. HN has some democratic institutions - like one account one vote. It even has some aspects of Athenian democracy where the mob gets to vote on daily decisions regarding articles, and as in Socrates day, rhetoric oft sways the passions and ballots of men (and unlike his day, women).<p>More specifically, I prefer the republic - in the platonic sense - as an abstraction for modeling online communities. Ultimately there is a sovereign with whom we form a Hobbesian compact. Participation in a compact with HN requires us to give up certain rights in exchange for a particular form of security. The rights we give up to HN&#x27;s sovereign and the security we gain are distinct from what we give up and obtain from the sovereign of StackOverflow or MSDNtechnet, or a professional cycling website.<p>The security we gain is largely that of reasonable norms. But among the rights we give up is that of not being subject to unreasonable policies at the extreme and policies with which we may niggle in the common.",1375110249

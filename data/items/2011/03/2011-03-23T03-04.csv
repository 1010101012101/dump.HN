2357925,comment,2349170,2349610,0,0,tsuyoshi,,,"I agree with most of this but I just wanted to emphasize: kanji is where most people fail. A lot of people think listening/speaking is the hard part (and it can be if you're learning a language with the same writing system as English, like French), and they put off learning kanji. Eventually they've gotten to a point where they can do trivial things in spoken Japanese but they can't read or write anything (except maybe in kana) and their vocabulary is minimal because they kept putting off learning kanji. And use Heisig - otherwise it really will take years to learn all the kanji, which isn't necessary at all. You can memorize the basic 2000 kanji in a few months. The first book I cannot recommend enough; the other two are kind of superfluous.<p>Whatever you do, do not under any circumstances try to learn using romaji. Not sure why but it will cripple your pronunciation. It is easy to tell who started out using romaji... and it is very hard to keep from laughing at their accent.<p>Don't bother memorizing grammatical rules. Languages don't really have rules, they have conventions. So you can use a grammar reference to figure out what a sentence means, but it will only take you through the basics as a lot of things that people say and write will not conform to any rule.<p>Make sure you are learning using things you're interested in - comic books, novels, TV shows, music, whatever. Don't waste your time with textbooks (except for textbooks on some topic you're interested in that happen to be in Japanese). When it becomes a chore, you will find excuses to study ""later"". ""Later"" eventually becomes ""never"". To be honest, my knowledge of words commonly used in Japanese pornography is embarassingly good because of this approach though...<p>The sooner you can switch to using a purely Japanese dictionary, rather than a Japanese-English dictionary, the better. It's very difficult at first (looking up a word, only to have to look up words in the definition of the first word, and so on) but you will find your comprehension skyrocket when you can ditch the J-E dictionary.",1300852629

The heat of vaporization of water is about 3 MJ/kg (heat of vaporization is more important than heat capacity, so we'll just use that).  That means that the fuel inside a 1 GWe nuclear reactor, <i>a day or two after shutdown</i>, can boil 12 kg of water in a second.<p>This is a fundamental property of nuclear reactors - no reactor design is going to make decay heat disappear.  So I would be skeptical of designs that claim to be ""passively cooled"".  What they mean is ""passively cooled for a while"", which is an important engineering achievement that I don't want to trivialize at all - I just think it puts the current designs a little in perspective, since some people apparently believe that you can scram a gen 4 reactor, go on a luxury 7-night cruise, and then deal with at your liesure, which isn't true - you've got to find a way to get water in there (or whatever), you just have a lot more time to do so because of the passive safety systems.",1300852347

I will silently do it.  No point in asking permission.

It's less of a WTF than you think.  You have to read the fine print of the supposedly ""passively cooled"" designs.  The Westinghouse AP1000, for instance, is ""passively cooled"" in the instance of a scram, but <i>only for 72 hours</i>.  Although this is about 9 times as long as the Japanese cooling systems ran on batteries, it is significantly less time than the reactors have been without power.  The fact is that a lot of decay heat is dumped into that system in a pretty short time, and you're going to need mass flows (read: pumps) if you're going to reject it all safely.<p>(I suppose a molten salt reactor might allow you to get more creative with mass transport, since you can conceivably move the <i>fuel</i> somewhere else, but those designs are a long way off, and I'm sure they come with their own unique hazards)",1300850433

Whether that bonanza for Google would have been a net win for total books scanned is hard to tell.<p>It doesn't have to be a company; you mentioned the government, and the nonprofit I work for (Internet Archive/archive.org) has a large book-scanning effort. It's also not that hard to do in a distributed, at-home fashion; see the following on DIY efforts and how to upload scans to archive.org:<p><a href=""http://onthecommons.org/diy-book-scanning-takes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onthecommons.org/diy-book-scanning-takes</a><p><a href=""http://blog.archive.org/2011/03/14/book-scan-wizard-software-now-supports-internet-archive-uploads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.archive.org/2011/03/14/book-scan-wizard-software...</a><p>Further, the total number of books that need scanning (as opposed to being born digital) is pretty close to capped, given the rise of born-digital versions and ebooks. Google itself estimated the total number of unique ""printed and bound"" materials recently as only 146 million:<p><a href=""http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-...</a><p>Google's scanned over 15 million with no guarantee of the ability to sell them or legal victory. Other libraries have scanned hundreds of thousands more. Scanning is definitely  happening faster than new print-only books are being created.<p>Clearing up the situation with 'orphan works' would help. A victory for Google and others on the matter of fair-use scanning for indexing and excerpting (without sales) would help, too. As you note, the scanning is still ""cheap compared to the rest of the operations"".<p>So it was never the case that Google needed a big economic incentive, or nothing would get done by Google or anyone else. That everything will be scanned is now a lock; it's just how fast and whether one company will dominate that's an open issue.",1300850074

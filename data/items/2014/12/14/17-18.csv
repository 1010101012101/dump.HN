Rather I find those situations problematic where employer does not realize they would need systems design nor know what it would look like in the first place.<p>Having some sort of &quot;guild verified&quot; systems designer licence might alleviate those situations by making the client realize the thingamajic they are ordering might need systems design and would actually require it in the contract. Would it help really? I don&#x27;t know but it would bring clarity to the profession-client interface by making the client more aware of the skills needed to implement the contract successfully.",1418579965

However, I will say that I use it in a somewhat &quot;different&quot; way compared to other setups. The middle monitor is the main workspace, and is where windows with active work on them go. The left and right monitors hold the 4+ windows with non-active or asynchronous information, like chat windows, documentation, comparison code windows, etc.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/JPY2sum.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/JPY2sum.jpg</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/FEumEXi.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/FEumEXi.png</a>",1418579778

What fish is this contract about? Correct answer: What they meant, not what they wrote down.<p>This might (or might not) be different in common law - but obviously still isn&#x27;t an issue unless one party brings the contract in front of a judge.<p>As for articles about legal cases: Highly popular cases typically make more sense when you dig into the details (eg. reading the actual decision, not just what some journalist misunderstood the court&#x27;s abstract to be about). Sometimes they remain puzzling - but I fear that&#x27;s a feature of all legal systems.<p>And then there&#x27;s the additional complication that patent cases seem to run under ever-so-slightly different rules to ordinary civil cases, no matter where.",1418579722

8748932,comment,8738869,8741937,0,0,fsiefken,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s a trade-off; or you keep the tags in a database on which you are dependent or you store everything in the file name or the file itself. Tagging inside the file can only be done if the filetype has support for it (exim or mp3 tags) and you have to program support for the different filetypes. Keeping it in a database necessitates a sync step between moving and renaming actions in the filesystem and the database itself and has to be programmed and tested for every OS.\nBy keeping the tags in the filename, this way this tag system still keeps working without the tooling itself and across operating systems, but you have to give up some freedom in the naming of your files (so it doesn&#x27;t really work on DOS).\nWhy wouldn&#x27;t you use such a system ever? People accept metadata in the file itself, the file name usualy describes the data - so why not use tags in the filename other then that it seems ugly hack?

8748929,comment,8747574,8747675,0,0,bradleyjg,,,"> Get bad advice from your lawyer as to what is legal and what isn&#x27;t, go commit a crime, and see what happens.<p>I should start out by saying that I hope the torturers, their superiors, and enablers are prosecuted by anyone that can get their hands on them: a future US administration, the ICC, a European nation, anyone.<p>That said the US legal analysis is very tough. The lawyers they were given &quot;bad&quot; advice by weren&#x27;t just lawyer, they were representatives of the sovereign that would seek to prosecute them. That raises due process concerns that aren&#x27;t present in an ordinary advice-of-counsel defense.<p>In addition to Constitutional problems, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and Military Commissions Act of 2006 create statutory defenses for torturers. The key language is &quot;it shall be a defense that such officer, employee, member of the Armed Forces, or other agent did not know that the practices were unlawful and a person of ordinary sense and understanding would not know the practices were unlawful. Good faith reliance on advice of counsel should be an important factor, among others, to consider in assessing whether a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the practices to be unlawful.&quot; To be sure, that&#x27;s not a unlimited immunity provision, but it does make prosecution more difficult. The Military Commissions Act also changed the substantive provisions 18 U.S. Code § 2441 (war crimes) to make much less conduct qualify.<p>Finally, except in cases where torture resulted in death, there are statute of limitation problems. Depending on which statute is use the limitation period for non-fatal torture or war crimes generally are either five or eight years.<p>In sum, there are many barriers to US prosecution. It may be much more practical for the wrongdoers to be prosecuted under the international law regime that began at Nuremberg. Given universal jurisdiction for violations of <i>jus cogens</i> this can happen in any country in the world, and there is no statute of limitations doctrine internationally.",1418579554

User Modeling extracts three types of\npersonal characteristics from the data a person generates in social media or within\ntheir written/digital communications:\nBig 5 Personality - This is the most used personality model that generally\ndescribes how a person engages with the world by the following five\ndimensions:\n– Openness-to-Experience - associated with curiosity, intellect, and an\nappreciation for art and adventure\n– Conscientiousness - associated with organization and industriousness\n– Extraversion - associated with positive and outgoing attitudes toward other\npeople\n– Agreeableness - associated with compassion and cooperation toward other\npeople\n– Neuroticism - associated with a sensitivity to negative emotions\nEach of the five top-level dimensions has six sub-facets that further characterize\nan individual at a finer-grained level.\nBasic Human Values - this model describes motivating factors that influence a\nperson&#x27;s decision-making. Our current model includes five dimensions of human\nvalues based on Schwartz&#x27;s work in psychology:\n– Self-Transcendence - motivated by helping others\n– Self-Enhancement - motivated by increasing social status\n– Hedonism - motivated by pleasurable experiences\n– Openness-to-Change - motivated by experiencing new things in the world\n– Conservation - motivated by tradition and conformity\nFundamental Human Needs - this model is based on Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of\nneeds and Ford&#x27;s work on Marketing and consumer-related needs modeling. It\ndescribes, at a high level, which aspects of a product will resonate most with a\nperson.\n– Ideal - the person likes high-end, finely crafted products\n– Self-Expression - the person likes products that express their individual\nidentity\n– Closeness - the person likes products that help them establish closer\nrelationships with family and friends\n– Excitement - the person likes products that provide exciting, adventurous\nexperience\n– Practicality - the person likes products that simply get the job done<p>For more detailed information about the research and technical background behind\nthe User Modeling service, see the following:\nYou read what you value: understanding personal values and reading interests\nGary Hsieh, Jilin Chen, Jalal Mahmud, Jeffrey Nichols; CHI 2014. 983-986.\nUnderstanding individuals&#x27; personal values from social media word use Jilin\nChen, Gary Hsieh, Jalal Mahmud, Jeffrey Nichols; CSCW 2014. 405-414\nRecommending targeted strangers from whom to solicit information on social\nmedia\nJalal Mahmud, Michelle X.

Feel free. :)<p>- As an IF author, I never intend players to guess a verb. But I do expect players to be familiar with the common IF verbs -- the stuff on the PDF sheet, basically. This was more true in 1996, when the IF community was tiny and all read the same Usenet group. I wrote this thing for enthusiasts.<p>- Today, I&#x27;d put more emphasis in the help docs on the difference between the two input modes (&quot;>&quot; and &quot;>>&quot;).

Nobody makes it and nobody drinks it, except the people who still do.<p>- Is it silly to write a text adventure in 2014? I put one up for sale a couple of months ago (hadeanlands.com) and it&#x27;s doing pretty well. Yes, for actual money.

8748837,comment,8745334,8747269,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"First of all, I would like to point out that when you say capitalism, it is a much more nuanced term than you seem to be inferring. Which kind of capitalism? Crony capitalism? What about Workers capitalism? A much different thing than the generic stereotypical capitalism you seem to be talking about. Why yes, of course, unbridled capitalism tends to swallow up more and more, sometimes exponentially and in a way that threatens the Constitution... which is exactly why, though the balance does not exist (and nor did it ever in the past, as you say, fully exist), but I see no logical reason to give up on the idea that we the people, under the power of just law, with a properly elected and sufficiently representative legislative of the people, could implement a balance heretofore unseen, prosperous for the American economy and it&#x27;s people.<p>You seem to argue against points I never made. Yes, they have been &quot;crushing the public&quot;, for quite some time. though, first of all, you need to define what you mean when you accuse someone of being some label. What exactly do you mean by &quot;moderates&quot; and &quot;balancers&quot;. Do you mean to say there should be no balance with the accumulation of capital and the private hands that prosper because of it, with the number affected of such and the degree to which they hold uneven power over the surrounding less fortunate populace? Would you toss away all private profit and push a purely socialistic system? For that is what you seem to be advocating here.<p>As an aside, it is of note that there have been ebbs in flows in this power dynamic, and I would argue that the American System and FDR were the closest thing we have come to so far as a proper, pragmatically implemented and physically verifiable program that does not only exist in theory as you seem to argue such prosperity and balance does.<p>I am a USMC combat veteran of the Iraq war, of a long line of military men. I am very aware of Smedley Butler and admire him as one of the best Marines to have ever lived, and his writings are considered essential reading. I&#x27;m sure you are also aware of the Business Plot he helped thwart?<p>Perhaps I think I may have misunderstood you earlier. We both agree that unbridled capitalism is bad, due to it&#x27;s destructive nature, yes? Ok then, it must be brought under a degree of control then. (The degree of which would be debatable.) How does one do that? Through the use of the state. It&#x27;s the 3 branches of government that need to be involved in the righting of these wrongs, but the problem is that we have allowed the same entities behind the supposedly failed Business Plot to just go dark and perform the coup more silently and in particular through the very business of capitalism and finance itself! When these items are properly governed for the good of the people they can be used as a force for good, and in unknown shadowy hands they can be used for bad.<p>I see no proposals of your own, though I eagerly await them. Mine would be based upon the Constitution. I&#x27;m not sure I fully comprehend your stance due to your ambiguity, but just be aware that anything unconstitutional should a priori be discarded.<p>P.S. Just because something is broken doesn&#x27;t mean it should be tossed in the trash. Many things can stand repair, and I think our Constitutional Democratic Republic is one of them.",1418577890

Even if we assume that it is space-time through which they propagate, this gives us another piece of math that we need to just throw away, similar to the non-observed probabilities after state collapse, which runs counter to the goal of creating a formalism where the math corresponds to something real in the universe(s).",1418577730

When I was in high school, it actually seemed like everyone could be a programmer. My mom was teaching programming at a state university extension campus. Her students were getting jobs after one year of school. I was already programming at the same level.

Most programming (truth be told, most product design, not just programming) is done by trial and error. Of course there may be a level of computer related activity above programming, that deserves to be called engineering, that is vital for critical tasks.

8748785,comment,8748598,8748743,0,0,patcheudor,,,"Our philosophy in the office is that alt-tab is for suckers.  While my setup is the most over the top we have three other people with five monitors or more.  We are all security researchers and find the configuration saves a bunch of time in reviews.  As an example, I can associate a MitM proxy like the Burpsuite or Fiddler 2 with the server side application which might communicate to web clients as well as to additional web services behind the scenes.  That takes up one monitor, typically the one at the far top left.  Under that monitor I can then associate another MitM proxy with the client.  I can then run the client from my laptop display.  If I&#x27;m working on a fat client, on the 30&quot; I&#x27;ll then run Wireshark which will effectively be watching the client.  On another monitor I can run sysinternal tools.  What remains I use for writing code necessary for the review, running additional tools like Metasploit, e-mail, chat, and research.  I arrange my workspace for the task at hand.  On a daily basis do I use all nine?  No.<p>Interestingly enough, with this sort of setup it&#x27;s pretty easy to visually see what&#x27;s happening when going after an application.  Before going to the monitor extreme I&#x27;d constantly alt-tab between my monitoring & exploit tools with every action.  Now I can run an action and see the results within one workspace.  Of course there is a massive downside.  It makes competing in CTFs a pain in the butt as I can&#x27;t drag that setup with me to physical events.",1418576927

8748755,comment,8747574,8747647,0,0,revscat,,,"The downside with prosecuting the agents is that it would be an admission that the United States government can do wrong. The primary factor in the US government&#x27;s decision matrix is &quot;admit no wrongdoing ever, to anyone, under any circumstances, for any reason.&quot; Don&#x27;t apologize, don&#x27;t prosecute criminal wrongdoing by agents doing the state&#x27;s business, and do not change. This has further implications: if the government has decided to do something, then it is by its very nature correct. And if the truth threatens to come out, such as in the CIA torture case, then the strategy is to fight disclosure every step of the way or, if that isn&#x27;t possible, to minimize the damage through manipulating public discourse.<p>I believe this has something to do with sociology or some unspoken theory of governance that is understood by those with the most authority in government. I don&#x27;t know if it is conscious or not, but intentional or no it&#x27;s as if they believe that alpha males triumph, for governments to be successful they must be alpha, and the United States is the most alpha of the alphas. And if you&#x27;re Alpha Alpha, you can not admit wrongdoing: that would indicate that maybe you shouldn&#x27;t have been alpha in the first place and makes future decisions harder to convince people to accept. If that pattern continues on for long enough... Well, maybe you won&#x27;t be a government anymore.<p>The Senate report was a great step. But the US will do nothing significant in response, because it is not in the nature of governments -- especially this one -- to attack themselves. Any changes will come as a result of external pressures, not from existing bureaucratic ones.",1418576408

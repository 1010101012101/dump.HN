516273,comment,516006,516006,0,0,mark-t,,,"I showed this article to a friend of mine who did a PhD in physics at Cambridge. Here's what he had to say:<p>The entanglement arguments against relativity are fairly silly. From that article, looks like Scientific American is going the way of the New Scientist. :( Absolutely no mention of Everett and his MWI (editor's note: multiple worlds interpretation) in the article I notice. Even though that's the most obviously straightforward way of keeping special relativity, locality, quantum mechanics and accounting for the Aspect experiment. Basically Bell's theorem that is supposed to prove non-locality makes a subtle assumption called ""counter-factual definiteness"", which implies among other things that experiments have definite outcomes. Obviously it's violated by MWI. Really it's only Bohmian mechanics that's non-local and arguably not consistent with SR. Though Bohm adherents often claim that Copenhagen must be non-local by Bell's theorem, they misunderstand the fact that the wavefunction in CI is really an epistemic device and wavefunction collapse isn't thought to be a genuine physical occurrence except by a very small minority. CI when viewed in this way doesn't satisfy counter-factual definiteness either.",1237071303

516253,comment,516006,516006,0,0,tc,,,"Summary:<p>For at least the last 70 years, physicists haven't taken the nonlocality predicted by quantum mechanics seriously enough.  Even supporters of QM considered the prediction of nonlocality a liability, and tried to dismiss it as an artifact in various ways.  Since much of QM couldn't be experimentally proven at the time, there was a fear that suggesting our assumptions of strict locality of action to be false would lead everyone to dismiss QM out of hand.<p>So, when we were finally able to empirically prove most of QM's predictions in the 80s, no one noticed that also meant nonlocality was a fact of our world, and that we should probably take the time to square that with our assumptions of spacetime geometry handed down by SR.<p>It now appears that to reconcile nonlocality with the things we know about spacetime geometry, we're going to have to challenge at least one other long-held assumption.  One proposal suggests that not only is space nonlocal, but so is time.  Another hypothesis suggests that the state of our universe at any given time is too infinitely complex to be reduced to even an infinite set of truth propositions.",1237070163

BTW we have tried your suggestion (growing our own) and after several attempts we're giving up: self-grown veggies have almost the same lack of taste as the  manufactured ones from a supermarket: I suspect that's because the seeds themselves have been genetically ruined. Same with farmers markets: their vegetables are not only tasteless, but they're also ugly and more expensive.<p>We've asked my parents in Russia to send me their seeds of tomatoes and cucumbers but they won't grow here due to climate/soil differences. So we're stuck with ""plastic"" ones from the store. Many 1st gen. immigrants I know, particularly from southern Europe, share my disdain for American agricultural products.

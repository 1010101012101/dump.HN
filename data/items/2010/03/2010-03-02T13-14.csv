That would bias academics towards liberalism - it's always easier to share the politics of those you surround yourself with.<p>Also, there's a certain expectation that academics can design society, and thus advance us. This idea -- that society can be designed -- is opposed by conservatives while at least somewhat embraced by liberals, which again could explain why intelligent people tend to be liberals.<p>Finally, the articles' assertion that liberalism is defined by ""weird ideas about, say, helping genetically unrelated strangers"" is one that every single conservative thinker, way back to Burke, would oppose.",1267538346

Also participate in beta testing, etc. But the release of 10.x left sour taste in my mouth as it was buggy too often for me. Suffering from countless ""last few elements loading"" issues, broken web sites and most important a beatdown in js and page-loading tests I have done (and seen elsewhere) from the more agile upstarts of Chrome and Firefox releases as they tried to one up each other. Even IE8 tested faster at times for me in loading pages I frequented.<p>But ever since they released the ""teaser"" of this new Opera right before Xmas 2009 I have been stoked and actively following its development and testing just about every new snapshot/beta they put out.<p>I've tried other browsers with extensions and such but none of them seem to feel as complete and as integrated as Opera. Hence why I still use it despite my ventures into Chrome/FF and even Safari (chrome is really nice as well and would be my default had Opera not gotten the hint).<p>Anyway, I am enthusiastically downloading the 10.5 release right now. A very large thanks to all the Opera developers for their efforts into this amazing release in short time. Everyone should try it.",1267537879

These things are really interesting, especially since I think most people here can identify with these people. I sure can.<p>I always felt that I didn't learn anything in school. But that is not true, I learned things when I had an intrinsical drive to learn those things. As a kid, I wanted to become an inventor, and I was really interested in science and watched the science program (it was on once a week here in Sweden) with my dad. When they aired the BBC documentary about dinosaurs I was really thrilled. My relatives taped them for me so I could watch them again, I watched them many times. I also liked tinkering with my computer (that had no internet connection, I used my mom's computer to go online). I started out learning how to modify your background and screensaver, then I quickly learned all the advanced features in the control panel and liked playing around with them. I picked up a (really crappy) book about HTML from the library and I was soon creating really crappy websites and hosting them on free hosting sites. I really impressed some people my age when I managed to modify the high score in a game we all enjoyed by finding the file it read the data from. Anyway, that is what I managed to do <i>on my own</i>, and I'm sure you guys have similar stories. At the same time I wasted time in school learning essentially nothing. In my Math classes in mandatory school I didn't even have book, a friend had lost his, so borrowed my book. I literally slept through my classes (I used to stay up late at night and sleep in the boring classes (ages 13-16), sometimes I slept in the school basement when I didn't have a class). I mean, I did NOTHING in my math class, and still passed it and even got a VG+ (B in the American System), I could've done better just spending my time at home. Do you guys have similar experiences? Please tell me about them.",1267537839

There was another one a week or so ago about a former sniper in Afghanistan.<p>Reading this reminded me of when I read about Jeff Greene about a year ago - another guy who made a mint from the housing/mortgage bubble collapse. See:
<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1006/266.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1006/266.html</a><p>I love these types of stories - an 'outcast' who spots a trend and is either ignored or heavily critised for their point of view, but ultimately proved right and met with a deafening slience.<p>It echoes a now infamous incident that happened in Ireland in 2007, when we were at the height of our own property boom. The then Prime Minister (or Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern, said that ""that he did not know how people who engaged in moaning about the economy did not commit suicide"".
<a href=""http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0704/economy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0704/economy.html</a>
Since then, Bertie has left his office in controversial circumstances over alleged corruption, and those who his remarks have been aimed at, such as courageous economists David McWilliams and George Lee, are held up as visionaries who warned about the dangers of excess when everyone else was gorging at the trough. As a result, the Irish taxpayer is to become the single largest owner of real estate in the WORLD, to the tune of €55bn ($75bn), because of the generous nature of the Irish Government bailout of the greedy Irish banks. This is in a country of just 4.5m people, which makes it all the more staggering. The Irish Government has bet the future of our country on the recovery of the Irish real estate market, and the youngest generation currently will end up paying for this stupidity over the next 50 years.<p>p.s. For all those who reckon it's morally wrong to make a fortune from a slump or crash, how is that different from making money in the good times? People are always borrowing foolishly (when the banks allow them to) and get into trouble even when the economy is doing ok.

I had hoped (perhaps erroneously) that a lot of fixed-cost effort in building a great configuration system could significantly reduce the need for hands-on customer service.<p>I have a Harmony remote.  The software doesn't ask me about remote control protocols, or any other technical stuff.  It just asks me what the model numbers are of the boxes in my family room.  Then, it configures activities (Watch TV, DVD, etc.) based on that and configures the remote so that it works.  The magic is the large database of A/V equipment so the user doesn't have to specify the details.<p>I'd like the configuration software to observe my traffic and notice that a particular computer is talking to backblaze.  It should ask me if I'd like to make sure backblaze can run really fast without affecting other activities and then just make it happen.  I shouldn't have to configure QOS settings using an iptables script I found one a guy's blog (to that guy, thanks a million!).",1267536132

Apple is not an OEM -- you can't call them up and easily order 50,000 iPads to integrate into your own offerings. You would have no idea when a new iPad is coming out and what features it may have. The iPhone/iPad platform aren't super manageable. This is something I'm sure Apple will be working on but right now the idea of a hospital using the iPad in any large deployment would be really difficult. You can't even do something as simple as centralized LDAP authentication from an iPad. As far as I know there's no way to push applications to an iPad or remotely upgrade it's firmware or all these other small things you would have to consider. A dumber tablet makes more sense for something like home automation or control panels for other integrated systems. They might be more expensive right now but the iPad will definitely drive prices of large touchscreen tablets down. So if you were building something like a home automation system would you build an iPad app for it? Sure. Would you design your entire platform around relying on the iPad? Absolutely not.",1267534858

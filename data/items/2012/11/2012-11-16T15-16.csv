4794304,comment,4788717,4793021,1,0,Hupo,,,">Personally I consider the 'naive' version (as in: the first, easy to manually verify version one would bang out as a prototype) to be one where a matrix is pre-allocated and each ring is filled in from the outside inwards (so first assign all 1's, then all 2's, and so on)<p>I'd consider the 'naive' version (and the first solution that popped to my mind pretty much instantly) to be where you first fill the grid with 1's, then then loop over the next level and add 1 and repeat until you're on the top. So like this for example:<p><pre><code>  function(a) {
    a = a | 1; // add 1 to even numbers
    var b = new Array(a),
        i, y, x,
        s = 0;
  
    // initialize the array
    for(y = 0; y < a; y++) {
      b[y] = new Array(a);
      for(x = 0; x < a; x++) {
        b[y][x] = 0;
      }
    }
    // turn it into a pyramid heightmap
    for(i = a; i > 0; i--) {
      for(y = s; y < i; y++) {
        for(x = s; x < i; x++) {
          b[y][x]++;
        }
      }
      s++;
    }
    return b;
  }
</code></pre>
Though in JavaScript it's a bit more complex than it might otherwise be since you can't just declare a multi-dimensional int array in a single line. Anyway, I discarded this solution about as fast as I came up with it because I knew there'd be more clever ways to go about it, and came up with the offset calculation method a couple minutes after that. And amusingly enough I had to actually test and iterate this 'naive' version a bit before I got it running right, whereas my 'complex' solution worked on the first try. Funny how that goes.",1353081367

>How would you handle a real complex type like Customer or Order or Window or Button?<p>Defining a type for it, just like anything else?  I don't understand what is confusing you here.  Do you normally just keep your Customers or Orders as a hash table of string:string or something?  Even in OO languages, you create a type for them, it just happens that the only way you can create types in most OO languages is making classes.<p>>Yes, it does. It's effectively the DRY principle -- you can't repeat the data manipulation code throughout the codebase<p>Yes you can, there is absolutely nothing stopping you from making a dozen different doThingToCustomer functions/methods scattered across a dozen different classes.  I am amazed that you are seriously suggesting that the problem OOP solves is people accidentally writing the same function multiple times, when that was never a problem, and OOP doesn't do anything to address it.

https://gist.github.com/4088402<p>Basically it generates a bcrypt hash using the site name and the password, and then uses the value of the hash to pick out a ten letter password according to certain specifications (starts with a letter, contains atleast one other letter, one number and one symbol).<p>It seems like having the hash only dependent on the site name is a <i>bad idea</i>... but I'm not sure what other choice there is.

Ok, we agree to disagree, let's stop talking about this for a few months and see what happens!<p>Meanwhile, it ""sounds ridiculous"" to me not because it's an untested concept, but because I think tablets are inherently different enough from desktops to justify keeping their interfaces distinctly separate. I don't think it's possible to fit more than one full touch app (or maybe a condensed version of a second one for a few simple use cases) comfortably on a 10"" screen (to say nothing of a 7"" one). I don't think giant buttons and pleasant whitespace are a good use of a desktop or laptop monitor.<p>><i>Which is why they haven't just done that. They've put a lot of thought into it and come up with a system that scales through different interfaces.</i><p>Except that they didn't, in the case of the Start Screen. Program and location menus, quick launch buttons, ""pinned apps,"" and lightweight search bars ala Unity Search/Windows Vista and 7 start menu search/dmenu, all of which <i>don't obscure the entire screen while I'm trying to do something,</i> are just some of the desktop workflow-friendly solutions to the ""how do I start doing something else"" problem that come to mind. The Start Screen doesn't completely break Windows, but it's still a bad idea on the desktop, and at least one instance of Microsoft prioritizing their tablet interface over their desktop interface.<p>><i>Except for windows tablets, that encourage multi-tasking.</i><p>Being able to prop a condensed view of an app up against an even more condensed view of another app is a far cry from being able to switch between dozens of running programs with a few keypresses and/or a mouse click.

4794270,comment,4784821,4785253,2,0,kragen,,,"I don't know of a good one, so I'll write one here.  This focuses on how things work, rather than how to use existing APIs, because I've basically never used GL.  What's below is short and doesn't have much math, but it should be enough to allow someone who knows linear algebra and 2-D graphics to both understand and rederive most of 3D graphics.<p>To rotate a point cloud, you multiply each point by a rotation matrix to get the rotated point.  A rotation matrix that rotates around the X-axis looks like<p><pre><code>    [[1  0  0]
     [0  c  s]
     [0 -s  c]]
</code></pre>
where s and c are the sin and cos of the angle you want to rotate.  Then you can do an orthographic projection by just dropping the Z coordinate, leaving just X and Y coordinates (which you may need to scale to your screen), or a perspective projection by dividing X and Y by Z. (Be wary of division by zero.)<p>The usual approach is to maintain the original points unrotated and make a rotated copy of them for every frame, instead of overwriting them with a rotated version every frame, so that numerical errors don't accumulate and you can get away with single-precision floating-point.  Also, conventionally, positive Z coordinates are in front of the camera and negative Z coordinates are behind it.<p>If the above isn't sufficiently clear, there's some code I wrote to generate an ASCII-art animation of a perspective-projected point cloud (the corners of a cube) at <a href=""http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2012-April/000540.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2012-April...</a>. It's 15 lines of code and the only library it depends on are Python's functions to sleep for a fraction of a second, output stuff to stdout, and round to integer.<p>EXTRAS:<p>DISTANCE: For things that aren't points, you might be interested in how far away they are from the camera, too, like to scale them or figure out which ones are in front.  That's the Z-coordinate after you rotate into camera space.<p>TRANSFORM COMPOSITION: If you want to rotate around two axes, it's probably better to multiply the two rotation matrices together, then multiply each point by the resulting transformation matrix, rather than doing two matrix multiplies for each point.  You can also scale camera space to screen coordinates this way.<p>TRANSLATION: If you want to move the camera, you probably want to translate your points so the camera is at the origin before rotating them.  If you represent your transformations as 4x4 matrices, with a possibly implicit fourth element in each point vector that is 1, you can represent translation in your transformation matrices too.<p>MULTIPLE SEPARATELY MOVING OBJECTS: A point cloud is a single rigid object. But whether you're drawing point clouds or something more complicated, it's often interesting to be able to move multiple objects separately.  The usual way is to go from two coordinate systems, camera and world, to N: camera, world, and one for each object.  Each object has a transformation matrix that maps its object space into world space.  You move the object by changing its transformation matrix.<p>POLYGONS: If you're drawing polygons, straight lines are still straight lines when you rotate them, and in either perspective or orthographic projections, so you can just rotate and project the corners of the polygons into your canvas space, and then connect them with 2-D straight lines (or fill the resulting 2-D triangle).<p>FLAT SHADING: The color resulting from ordinary illumination (""diffuse reflection"") is the underlying color of the polygon, multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the normal (perpendicular) to the surface and the direction of illumination; it's easiest to compute that cosine by taking a dot-product between two unit vectors, and to compute the normal by normalizing a cross-product between two of the sides.  If you have more than one lighting source, add together the colors generated by each lighting source.  You probably want to treat negative cosines as zero, or you'll get negative lighting when faces are illuminated from behind.<p>BACKFACE REMOVAL: if you're drawing a single convex object made of polygons, you can do correct hidden surface removal just by not drawing polygons whose normal points away from the camera (has a positive Z component).  This is a useful optimization even if your object is more complicated, because it halves the load on the heavier-weight algorithms below.<p>HIDDEN SURFACE REMOVAL: If your polygons don't intersect, or only intersect at their edges, you can use the ""painter's algorithm"" to get correctly displayed hidden surfaces by just drawing them in order from the furthest to the closest; if they do intersect, you can either cut them up so they don't intersect any more, or you can use a ""Z buffer"" which tells you which object is closest to the camera at each pixel --- as you draw your things, you check the Z buffer to see what's the currently closest Z coordinate at each pixel you're drawing, and if the relevant point on that object has a lower Z coordinate, you update that pixel in both the Z buffer and the canvas.<p>SMOOTH SHADING: you can get apparently smooth surfaces out of quite rough polygon grids by storing a separate surface normal at each vertex, and then instead of coloring the whole polygon a single flat color, interpolate.  You can either compute the colors at the corners of the polygons and interpolate the colors at each point you draw (Gouraud shading) or you can interpolate the normals and redo the lighting calculation for each point (Phong shading), which gives you dramatically better results if you have specular highlights.<p>SPECULAR HIGHLIGHTS: The diffuse-illumination calculation explained in ""FLAT SHADING"" above is sufficient for things that aren't shiny at all. For things that are somewhat shiny, you want ""specular highlights"", and the usual way to do those is to do the lighting calculation a second time, but instead of directly using the cosine of the angle between the light source direction and the surface normal, you take that cosine to some power (called the ""shininess"" or ""Phong exponent"") first.  The 5th power is pretty shiny.<p>FOG: Faraway things fade exponentially. That is, you take the density of the fog (a fraction slightly less than 1) to the power of the Z coordinate of the point on the object, and multiply that by the color of the object.<p>TEXTURE MAPPING: If you want your surfaces not to be a single solid color, you can use a raster image (called a ""texture"") to map colors onto the surface.  You just figure out where you are on the surface (by doing a matrix multiply from your surface point into ""texture space"") and figure out which texture pixel (""texel"") you're at, or which ones you should interpolate between.  (You can also use some other function to generate the color, rather than having an explicitly stored texture.  The important thing is that it maps a 3-D point in object space to a color.) This is the start of the whole universe of ""shaders"", which represents a big part of current 3-D work.  Another application of shaders is bump mapping:<p>BUMP MAPPING: If you're doing Phong shading, you can get apparent texture (in the usual sense: something you could feel if you could touch the object) on your surfaces without having to transform more points by simply perturbing the interpolated surface normals you're using to do your shading calculations.  It's helpful if you perturb them in a deterministic way so that the texture moves with the surface.",1353081031

I never realized this link would be worth 300+ Hacker News points, but I thought the story around it might be interesting enough to share.<p>I was working on a client site that required the use of IE 7 to test a particular bug. I had installed VirtualBox in the past, but after doing a fresh install of OS X I was trying to avoid that whole process.  In fact I was even considering installing the old, old version of IE 5.5 that was actually released for the Mac platform back in the stone age.  So I went to Google and searched for ""ie os x"" and found this: 
http://samvermette.com/256.  This was the first I heard of Microsoft releasing free VMs so I thought, ""Hey cool, I'll share this on Twitter"".  I posted the link, @stroughtonsmith retweeted it and before I knew it I had retweets and stars coming in at a consistent clip.<p>Through the retweets came a single mention pointing me over to https://github.com/xdissent/ievms which was quite useful for my case.  Knowing the original article was published in June of 2011 I knew this wasn't new information, but I figured I'd post the link to HN anyway. I figured somebody had to have posted it in the past, so I might get a duplicate link error or something.<p>Well that didn't happen and immediately it started to get points and comments, very helpful comments at that.  I chimed in a few times in the beginning and got bonus points for a couple of my early comments.<p>So a few things I learned from this: HN doesn't necessarily reward new, cutting edge information, chiming in early to a trending topic is worth a fair number of comment points, and you learn a lot more about a topic than you do posting a link to Twitter.

For instance, Sony has often tried to make things smaller and cooler-looking than competing products, from the WalkMan to the Vaio to the modern day. Few companies enter a market resolving ""I'm going to just try to make <i>exactly</i> what other guys are making."" (Well, okay, maybe Samsung does that.)<p>No, the big difference is that Apple often <i>succeeds</i> when they try ambitious new designs, whereas Sony and HP and Microsoft usually fail when they try to do the same thing.<p>I've always thought there was a large amount of self-fulfilling prophesy involved in this. Apple, like Tinkerbell, works primarily because we believe in it. If we stopped expecting it to succeed, it would stop succeeding.<p>Suppose HP releases a product that seems really cool and potentially useful but has a few annoying flaws - the software doesn't work quite right. Few buy it, HP never fixes any of the flaws, HP discontinues production, and you find the abandoned product on the discount shelf at Fry's.<p>Now suppose Apple does the same thing. Because <i>it's Apple</i> we know they're committed to <i>fixing</i> the initial obvious flaws. Developers and users see the <i>potential</i> in the new product, not just what it is but what it could be. People buy it. A rash of ""early adopters"" buy it practically sight unseen and then whine in blogs/newspapers/magazines about what Apple needs to do next to make it perfect. Apple takes the revenue they get from those early sales, considers the suggestions, and <i>fixes the problems</i>. The original buyers get a software patch; new buyers get version 2.0 that fixes the original problems and more.<p>The first iPhone didn't have copy-paste and didn't allow third-party apps and didn't have an ""app store"". People bought it, and within a year or so it did have those features.

E.g. it's often used in an architecture which pairs a dynamic web service with static HTML templates, CSS, and JS (no dynamic server-side HTML generation). In this way it is similar to ExtJS/YUI, but generalizes those widget-centric frameworks.<p>It's not for tightly-scoped JS enhancements.<p>In terms of patterns, it adheres mainly to the Model-View-Presenter pattern (embodied in the Model class, the HTML template, and the View class respectively). Switching between logical pages in the single-page app is supported by the Router class (which implement the front controller pattern). Data persistence/retrieval is oriented toward RESTful web services (this is customizable) and therefore pairs will with ActiveRecord-based server frameworks like Rails.  The separation of concerns it encourages increases testability, and also allows it to pair well with asynchronous module loaders (e.g. RequireJS).",1353079944

FRAND patents are it. It's interesting to see how the notion is completely lost on some supporters
of the FRAND patent regime. Their argument is fundamentally the same as the people who reject
the notion of patents to begin with. It typically boils down to ""Unfair!"". Just much embellished
with useless appeals to emotion that differ not a whit from the arguments made against the patent
system in general. For example: ""But how would my <pet company> be allowed to participate in the
market if someone <i></i>OWNS<i></i> this territory!?!one1eleven?"". And: ""This is not good for the consumer!"".<p>Except of course when exactly the same argument is made against the patent system in general.
A lovely little retort to that has become a favorite refuge of the patent supporters:
""You just want to - "" -- wait for it -- ""STEAL!"". Apparently, elementary logic is unavailable to
the so called inventors. Because, believe it or not, an argument has even been made that you're
not an inventor, unless you support the patent system. Even more, an argument has been made that
you're dirty thief... unless you support the patent system.<p>The patent system has outlived its usefulness. Nay, it hasn't been useful since day one. It arrived
stillborn, and its zombie has been haunting the inventors world over ever since it's been exhumed.<p>An impassioned appeal you say? A thousand times yes. The patent system is an unethical social
construct that has been perpetrated upon and abused... against countless honest, fair folks who
want nothing more than to practice the fruits of their labor. Many, many times their labor is
a function of an independent discovery. This is often challenged by patent supporters as impossible.
Their argument boils down to: ""You can't invent FFT! Only the patent supporters can!""<p>Last of course, but far from least is the fundamental hypocrisy of this all: if you were to enumerate
everything the patent supporters use to practice their art, you will invariably find their contribution
insignificant, nay, not even visible when placed against the foundational background. They readily
accept locking out entire swaths of science and technology for themselves, without ever acknowledging
the monumental contribution of people... mathematicians, scientists... GIANTS!<p>Those giants, in their generosity and brilliance have made our world better. The patent system, I would

It's not perfect, and it's uses are (for now) somewhat limited, but I feel your criticism of it may be a little overly harsh.<p>First off, the current Lytro model does not, and will not, replace any traditional camera I own. I like the technology, and it has it's uses even beyond demoing the refocusing abilities, but it's definitely a supplement to my camera arsenal and not a replacement for anything.<p>You're right that you can ""simulate"" focus-stacking with a traditional camera, as long as the object you're shooting is sitting still and there's no motion of the camera or in the frame at all. Any motion at all and your simulated focus stacking doesn't hold up well.<p>Likewise, you can get a perspective shift from multiple images by slight movement with a traditional camera. Assuming again that no actual motion happens and that no observable length of time transpires between the successive offset shots.<p>Since the Lytro doesn't have these time limitations, and since focus can be done after the fact, I've been able to get a couple of shots of events that I could never get with a traditional camera, just based on the ability to point the camera and snap the shutter without having to even wait for autofocus to happen.<p>The hardware in the camera to me feels far ahead of the software that drives it. One of the biggest criticisms I have of the Lytro is that the camera captures a vast amount of light field information, and through The Appropriate Application of Mathematics, you should really be able to do a lot more with the captured pictures than you can now. I remain hopeful that as the camera software progresses that more of these possibilities will come to light, and so far other than the time involved to develop the software I haven't been disappointed - there have been pretty regular software updates, and features are being incrementally added.<p>The Lytro isn't perfect - I'll grant you that - but it's a radical change in technology, and I think that over time the technology can only get better. The price for the current model is a little higher than ""what the heck, I'll try one out"" typically justifies.<p>One thing I use my camera for - more than the refocusability - is macro photography. The Lytro has an absolutely <i>insane</i> macro focus capability. It can focus right down to the front of the exterior lens, and it does a great job at shooting small objects at short range - better than any SLR macro lens I have, and I have a couple of ""not cheap"" ones to compare it to.",1353078907

I think it is scary that politicians are put in charge of thousands of employees and billion pound budgets without having to have any experience managing in the first place.<p>MP's are in charge of procurement. Take defense. If you have no experience procuring weapons / aircraft / whatever how do you know you are getting a good deal? Sure there are advisers and whatever but surely before you approve say a 10B pound submarine project you should know something about submarines, who builds them and what is a reasonable figure to pay?<p>I feel as well that one person cannot be responsible for such a broad range of topics like ""Culture, Media, and Sport"" which the Internet inevitably falls in to.<p>Regarding the point about ""children are more technically aware than their parents"" I think it is invalid. I think as a parent you need to involve yourself in your children's lives. You need to get up to speed with what is current. The excuse of ""I'm old"" or ""I'm not hip / tech savvy / whatever"" doesn't fly. It really isn't difficult to ask Google how to filter web content. Just as it wasn't difficult for me to phone up my TV provider and ask how I hide the adult channels on my TV.<p>You don't need to be a genius to work a computer. You just need to apply yourself a tiny little bit to do whatever it is you are trying to do.",1353078100

Whilst the internet definitely comes under this department, in a year that this department was also responsible for delivering the Olympics, I don't know why I expect her be any more knowledgeable about the Internet than Archery.",1353078056

The only reason that recent immigrants can affect the election is because recent immigrants are voting the same way as a large portion of the current electorate.   That argument applies today and it will apply in the future even if immigration levels double.   If they go up an order of magnitude, it might not, but nobody is suggesting that.<p>I'm having trouble parsing your last paragraph.

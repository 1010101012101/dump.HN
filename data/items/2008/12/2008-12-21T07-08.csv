The employee might sue.<p>In a startup that's just not even considered.  Interesting.",1229845294

405298,comment,404631,404817,0,0,electromute,,,"Thanks, Al.<p>Yes, if you've ever tried to create a mashup using data from Twitter, digg, delicious, etc., you know the problem is that you have to poll their entire data set (without exceeding their api request limits) to get at the data you are trying to track.<p>With Gnip, you get an abstraction layer so you can create a filter based on usernames, for instance. When these users do something, like tweet, we post that data back to you.<p>In this scenario, you no longer have to poll arbitrarily for needles in haystacks--we push the needles to you when they occur.<p>Hope that helps! If anyone is interested in utilizing data from the social graph to create their app (or if you are interested in publishing data you have for public use), we have a Group list: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/gnip-community"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/gnip-community</a> as well as documentation on our site, www.gnipcentral.com and a set of client libraries (we are currently evolving) to help facilitate such endeavors.<p>Cheers!",1229844486

I've had difficulty loading content hosted in Beijing from a browser on a different network elsewhere in Beijing.<p>Historically, locations that have been given unfettered Internet access have purchased it from the telecoms at higher prices.

But, we officially only allow running of flash programs that are built using our (loose) framework, so that it integrates nicely with our operating environment.<p>We did a limited production run, but are currently not producing them anymore so that we can concentrate on software development more.",1229843028

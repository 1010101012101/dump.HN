While I have never created a composite character myself, a couple of times I did describe a composite scene: say I had spent a week with my subjects and one night one of the characters made a remark at dinner, and the next night someone else said something else during dinner, I chose to recount those two events as taking place the same night during the same meal. I made that decision (which I'd discussed with my editor) becaue either the two events occured on two different nights randomly, and could have just as easily taken place on the same night, and I didn't want to interrupt the flow of the story or the reader's image of the scene, or, they may have been a good reason for these two events to have occured separately, but that reason was complicated, and explaining it would have detracted from the story. Did I do a disservice to the truth? I don't think so. Here's why.<p>To explain it in terms familiar to the readers of this forum, journalism is a ""reverse problem"". The journalist's job is not listing facts, but extracting a model of the truth from a sample set of observation data. This is a very difficult problem. In contrast to what many critics think, a good journalists must not only stick to ""the facts"", because the facts are simply a biased sampling of reality. Sticking to the facts is just like connecting sample points with lines - it's called overfitting and it's as gross a mishandling of the truth as negligent interpolation or extrapolation is. Neither sticking to facts nor ""completing"" them  is ""the truth"". A good journalist is one who is able to recreate a good model of reality, a fine approximation of it, by relying on observed facts as well as on gut instinct and genuine emotion, and who's able to convey the model as clearly as possible to his audience, introducing neither outright fabrications nor irrelevant and confusing facts.",1331991896

3717018,comment,3716781,3716781,12,0,PaulHoule,,,"I've been using Linux since 1993,  and back then,  the Linux OS and desktop were far superior to Windows 3.1.<p>Then Win 95 came out and that had a decent desktop.  I remember when the KDE people started talking about a desktop for Unix and people didn't get it,  but when we saw the beta it was like... Wow!<p>Then Red Hat Linux didn't like the license of KDE,  so they had to create Gnome.  As a result,  rather than having one good Desktop,  the average Linux has two half-baked desktops.  This fork has wasted people's energy and been a distraction away from an excellent experience.<p>Another example of this is sound.  I don't know how many incompatible sound APIs exist for Linux now,  I know it's more than the fingers on one hand.  The consequence of it all is that often sound doesn't work and unless you're a crazy enthusiast you might never get it to work.<p>I was a Linux zealot until 2003 or so when I had a job that had me using a Windows machine a lot,  and by that point there was Win XP which was a huge improvement over Win 95.<p>I still use Linux on servers,  but desktop Linux has largely disappeared from my life.  Every so often I try to install it here or there,  but I typically find the experience disappointing.  I was a Fedora fan for a long time,  but Fedora became increasingly finicky about where it would install.  I switched to Ubuntu,  but every installation ends up having some serious problem.<p>For instance,  Ubuntu installed just fine on my PPC Mac Mini with the exception that the fan runs full speed all the time and the machine sounds like a vacuum cleaner.<p>Windows and Mac OS have been on a general trajectory of improvement -- sometimes there are changes you don't like,  but the overall direction is good.  Linux did,  after years of struggle,  get a stable multiprocessor kernel (2.6) but other than that I get the feeling Linux has been going backwards not forwards.",1331990913

Our mental models are pretty limited in that we see and feel what we wish to see and feel. Talking to people helps open up whole new ways of looking at things. There's always another perspective you failed to see.<p>I recently came across the Stanford design Bootcamp Bootleg [1]. It outlines the whole process for getting from an itch to a working product. And they obsess over empathy. It's all over the Bootleg. Interview potential users, learn how they currently solve the problem you're trying to solve and show them how your idea could help them.<p>The Bootleg is highly recommended. Even if you don't follow the practices it describes, it pays to have those mental models.<p>We were brainstorming recently. And we did this entire exercise. We went to meet students, shop owners, teachers and even some folks at the local administration. It was extremely tedious but our efforts paid off. We gathered insights that range from pretty obvious to mind-numbing and some even rather stupid.<p>We then made a small web presentation [2] of the most interesting ideas and asked people to vote and give their suggestions. It has been a very rewarding experience.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Bootc...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://idea.diwank.name"" rel=""nofollow"">http://idea.diwank.name</a>",1331990481
3717005,comment,3715816,3716924,1,0,jacobolus,,,"The extent of my experience with R was a couple of somewhat introductory statistics courses, so Im not the best person to answer probably.<p>But I like dealing with numpy/scipy <i>much</i>, <i>much</i> more than R. Python as a language is I think much better designed, and numpy is a really nice tool for interacting with multidimensional arrays. When I write Python code, or read Python code written by anyone competent, I find program intent very easy to design/follow. Most of the R code Ive seen in the wild is kind of a mess, because it is written by non-programmers many of whom have little experience or concept of code style. Additionally, as soon as a program has to do anything other than statistical analysis (examples: text munging, internet scraping, network communication, dealing with file formats, user interaction, etc.) Python is miles ahead.<p>The big advantages of R that I saw: (1) it has become the tool of choice in the academic statistics community, meaning that there is quite a lot of existing code for doing various sophisticated things, some of which you might have to implement yourself in Python, (2) it has some really nice graphing tools, (3) there seemed to be a few examples where a particular few lines of R code were more compact and clearer than the equivalent Python (cant think of anything off-hand though).",1331990425

3717000,comment,3716781,3716950,6,0,bryanlarsen,,,"Actually, your post is making me optimistic.<p>On Linux, the 4 most common API layers encountered by an application are:<p>1) system calls\n2) standard (and not-so-standard) libraries\n3) X11\n4) d-bus<p>#1 is notoriously stable.   Linus often posts quite a vehement response to anybody who proposes breaking #1.<p>#3 was for a long time, TOO stable, it wasn't taking advantage of new developments in hardware and design.   The breakup of XFree86 freed that up.<p>#4 is relatively stable because it's a cross-distribution partnership.  They're designed to be the same across multiple distributions which by necessity makes them stable.<p>The problem are for Linux is #2.   Most standard libraries are actually very stable on the micro level.   The problem is the vast area they expose: if a single backwards-incompatible change can break your app, it's a problem if there are a million things that can potentially change.<p>Windows & OS X applications ""solve"" this problem by shipping their libraries with their applications.<p>I think Linux has a potentially even better solution:  simply allow multiple versions of applications and libraries to be installed simultaneously, a la rubygems & bundler.  You'll get all the disk space savings of shared libraries at the point of initial install, which will slowly erode as users install new apps, upgrade some apps but not others.   But who cares?  Disk space is cheap, but more importantly, if the user cares he can do something about it, only upgrading applications when the whole application upgrades.",1331990095

The ultimate result of that sort of thing is a monopoly on repairs and upgrades, where only approved mechanics who promise to only make approved changes can do useful work.  This may be good for the bottom line of the car manufacturer, who ultimately wants you to buy another car, but it is not good for society.<p>Software is also a special case, in that it is rapidly becoming our society's primary means of communication and decision making.  Some things, games and toys, don't matter really and are not a matter of great concern. But other things, operating systems and communication platforms, social networks, voting systems... it can be argued that allowing these to be closed and proprietary is something we should never accept.<p>Also, keep in mind that Intellectual Property is not a natural right - it is an artificial construct, a monopoly granted by government to encourage innovation and for the benefit of society.

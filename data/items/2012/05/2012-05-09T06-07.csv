Internal security do get notice of such attempts immediately and verify the transactions. I have seen cases where ""transfers 100k to your account, withdraw it as cash 5 minutes later"" ends up in arresting the guy right there in the branch while asking to make the withdrawal.<p>In any case, ACH/wire transfers that take a day or less and cost no more a few cents are easily possible; but the banks aren't motivated to do this. In EU, the government forced us by law to offer better conditions for customers; otherwise the fees&float were good income (free rent) as long as everybody else is using the same ACH. A central ACH that has a lot of technical delays and high fees essentially allows a price-fixing cartel without technically/legally being a price-fixing cartel.",1336546555

In the course of it I implemented a very simple scene with Yampa and an OpenGL binding for Haskell. The reason I chose Haskell was mainly because I never had a functional programming course in university and decided that I want to give it a try. (The code is at <a href=""https://github.com/Joe-Z/yampa-programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Joe-Z/yampa-programming</a> if you are interested).<p>The problem, in my opinion, of so much of functional programming research is that the presented applications are most often developed only for the sake of one or two research papers and then stopped pursuing. This leads to various papers, scattered across the internet, which all hold some precious information, but are incredibly hard to put together and make real world things out of them (I remember, when I just recently had to search through 7 years of Yampa mailing list, to maybe find some information on a problem I had).<p>Which is why I decided to add some Yampa Hello world-like programs to the aforementioned repository, so lone wanderers through the field of FRP are not so lost after all.<p>[edit: should me more readable with paragraphs...]",1336546372

Any new hire has a lot to learn when joining any team and scm is just a small part. Even if a team uses git and a new hire is a git master she will still have to learn that specific team's infrastructure and process that goes with it, so there's still a learning curve. Unless it's a very early startup it will take most people a month or two to get really ramped up in a new team and that is plenty of time to learn an scm.<p>Maybe for open source projects it makes sense to stick with the most popular tool but for private teams if you can see an advantage to another tool and it looks like it will be around for a while then there is no reason not to use it.",1336546313

I merely said that c/c/p is at once too difficult/brittle and too limited.<p>Personally, I wish we used some kind of mashup/spinoff/extension of DragThing, Quicksilver, drag-and-drop for this sort of thing: flexible, letting us do more with the stuff in it than just paste it back, accessible from both keyboard and mouse ideally from anywhere on the screen, persistent and non-destructive.

An exchange differs from OTC only in that it is more centralised. The NASDAQ is no more an exchange than the currency markets (both are de-centralised, quote-driven markets).<p>><i>by virtue of its size and position</i><p>Market makers on traditional exchanges have information from volume that smaller players don't. In fact, the centralisation means the cumulative frequency distribution of market power trails off faster on traditional exchanges versus OTC markets (this is why mom and pop can stick guns to the banks in pink sheets but less so on the NYSE).<p>><i>stronghold that banks have on currency trading</i><p>You don't have to go through a bank. You can list your currency trade on a currency bulletin board. But they will still have market makers who amass advantage by volume. Most currency hedgers, except the very largest, go through a bank because they get good spreads. FX market making is <i>very</i> competitive (a border between you and your competitor doesn't help) and can always be dis-intermediated. Stock exchanges get a lot of volume from regulatory fiat. If you really want a centralised FX exchange note that currency brokerages internally crosses their orders - you can draw a box around those brokerages and call them exchanges if you'd like.<p>FX market making fails to make indecent profits save for the effects of insider information, usually from central banks. If there is a ""stronghold"" we were all playing our cards rather stupidly.<p>><i>exchanges have appeared for everything, from bandwidth to energy to pork bellies</i><p>Requiring everything be on a quote-driven exchange doesn't make sense - it is stupid to subject to an illiquid market (esoteric derivatives) and stupid to subject to a market that's already nearly perfectly liquid (currencies).<p>As an aside, I would guide anyone looking at Wall Street to note that the centre of gravity of influence has long since shifted away from the banks and towards proprietary market makers, e.g. GETCO, Knight, and hedge funds, e.g. Bridgewater, SAC. For the time being the new citadels of power are sufficiently de-centralised to be highly competitive with each other and, as a cohort, the banks.",1336545923

Some hopefully constructive criticism:<p>a) having to login to read comments posted on a vehicle is a major barrier to users spending time on your site, and is going to limit the SEO value of your content => why not just show what people have to say, and provide more engaging content to the folks who happen to find your site via search?  By showing this I think you'll increase both your SEO and likelihood of converting browsers => registered members.<p>b) what's the value of membership? what's your ""club?""  CarDomain, while it doesn't have the glossy look/feel of your site, has a very large membership (850k members/cars profiled last i checked), and vibrant sub-communities of conversation around trucks, donks/boxs/bubbles, tuners, etc etc -- what's your community, your niche? <i>who</i> are you catering to? where's your beachhead?  You may want to consider catering to a specific community to help increase your traction, and expand outward once you're rolling...<p>c) are you going to police your content?  browsed and noticed a couple fake-y looking profiles, e.g. <a href=""http://motobabble.com/bearx/2012-a4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motobabble.com/bearx/2012-a4</a> which is listed as an Audi (i <3 audis btw) & it's actually stock/OEM photos of a VW... if you're building a community they'll appreciate accuracy & authenticity.  The blog staff @ CarDomain invests a lot of time doing this, and their community really appreciates it... nice to know if you ask someone about how their Bugatti Veyron handles that they actually know.<p>As @dif points out
i) one reason CarDomain & others remain so strong is the amazing amount of content and membership they already have.  How can you quickly build a community?  Hmmm, if only you could... be the car-talk/car-photo-share app on Facebook... integrate with some existing auto sites to make photos ""easier""... many, many angles to pursue.<p>ii) foster / cultivate specific communities:  truck folks like trucks, Chevy/Ford truck folks like similar, and Scion folks will like to converse with Scion folks, etc etc... not that they won't talk to each other, but birds of a feather def'ly flock together.  Perhaps this ties to the 'beachhead' point above.<p>And actually, reach out to CarDomain/Streetfire -- they're great folks.  They'll be difficult to steal traffic from too because they're amazingly good at building fostering their own community, but I'd be surprised if they weren't pretty cool frien-e-mies to talk to.<p>Good luck-

For example, when I first started to use a Mac I had to Google to figure out how to import ebooks into my iPhone.  It turns out that you have to drag-and-drop into iTunes.  Just like c/c/p, once someone tells you that this is the way we are going to play the game it all makes sense.<p>The grab-something-and-move-it interface is OK for ""normal"" users.  I would suspect that most techies might be far more inclined to figure out how to avoid miles of drag-and-drop action by using the keyboard.<p>There's another element to this.  Our systems have, at a minimum, two 24 inch monitors and most have three 24 inch monitors.  Drag-and-drop gets pretty old once you start to have to cruise around so much real-estate.<p>Beyond that c/c/p, per your own data point, has been around since the early 70's.  That makes it a convention that's been around for possibly over 40 years.  I think people get it.<p>This, of course, extends to operating almost any software.  If someone is using it with any regularity it'd be crazy to mouse all over the menu system to get things done.  The keyboard is far more efficient.  This is particularly the case when macros can be programmed and invoked.<p>In general terms, I agree: For grandma, drag and drop is great and she is not likely to learn any keyboard shortcut at all.  For anyone who is not a casual or lightweight computer user there's a whole other layer to the UI --via the keyboard-- that makes for better driving.<p>Dragondrop is a great tool.  I was sincere when I said that Apple should buy it and integrate it into the OS.  Not for me and those like me, but for the benefit of others for whom the grab-and-do-something interface is the only option.",1336545848

A better system, though, would have some of these properties: it would persistently store cut/copied content in some kind of list, at least content of manageable size; it would have some way to see the clipboard visually/spatially; it would interact with drag/drop; it would give some visual indication that there was currently copied content, and perhaps the type as well; it would allow a user to interact with the history of cut/copied items in a more flexible way both from keyboard and mouse; it would allow easy conversion of copied chunks into documents/files/pages in their own right.<p>Many of the problems here intersect with the problems of our current files + hierarchical filesystem + semi-spatial file browser + open/save dialog system for dealing with content in general. Ideally, a generally more intuitive and flexible basis for these problems would be built, and the replacement for c/c/p would integrate with these other tools. Thats sort of wishful thinking though. (Well, the idea of replacing c/c/p is also probably wishful thinking. Systemically different approaches like the Canon Cat word processor are all pretty much dead by now.)",1336545519

3947261,comment,3946856,3947135,10,0,haberman,,,"I agree with Linus that creating a solid merge base is far more important than clever merging.  But I think there is still room for improving on Git in this respect.  A lot of what I'm about to say is inspired by this video from the Camp guys: <a href=""http://projects.haskell.org/camp/unique"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.haskell.org/camp/unique</a><p>Git forces you to treat your history as a single linear sequence of commits.  This is an unnecessary restriction if some of the changes in that sequence are totally independent of each other.  For example, if two changes touch two completely different files and are unrelated, why should you be forced to sequence them in one order?<p>Here is a practical situation illustrating this limitation.  Once in a while I'll want to patch a coworker's in-progress change into my working directory where I also have changes.  Perhaps I want to build a binary with several experimental in-progress changes in it.  Suppose my coworker's changes are totally independent of mine (say they touch completely different files).<p>I can do this in Git by applying his patch to my working directory (or doing a ""git merge"" with his branch).  But now suppose I'm done with the experiment and want to back out my coworker's change, so my working directory is left with only my change.  If I haven't made any more tweaks to <i>my</i> change in the meantime then I'm ok, I can just ""git reset --hard HEAD^"" to discard my coworker's change.  But what if I made further changes to my change in the meantime?  There's no easy way with Git to manipulate the two changes independently within the same branch, even though there are no actual dependencies between them.<p>Sure you could create a separate branch for the merged thing.  Every time you want to change <i>your</i> part you switch back to your branch, make the change, then switch back to the merged branch and merge again.  But who wants to be that disciplined?  Who should <i>have</i> to be that disciplined when the computer could do the work of knowing that the two lines of change are independent of each other?<p>Git's ability to create stable and verifiable SHA1's is important, and I think that any future SCM will need to have this capability.  But I don't think this implies that you have to treat the history in a strictly linear way.  You could create SHA1 checkpoints when a particular person wants to publish and/or sign a tree and its contents, but still allow the individual commits to be treated in a more flexible way.  The SHA1 checkpoints could be like barriers; each change is either part of the checkpoint or not, and the checkpoints could know their parent checkpoint(s) so that there is still a verifiable history available for auditing.<p>I hope an approach like this could make large projects like Linux more intuitive to follow.  I always found it unfortunate that the graph of commits for any project with lots of merge activity is totally indecipherable.  For example, here is a screenshot of Git's own Git repository: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/RyQm3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/RyQm3.png</a>  If independent changes could be viewed independently, and if every merge didn't have to be an explicit commit, perhaps this could be easier to follow.<p>There are definitely lots of unanswered questions here and I don't claim to have all the answers.  My point is just that I don't think Git is necessarily the last word in distributed version control.",1336543342

They upload the file and Github explains to them that it should be kept secret, and the developer has the opportunity to revoke the file. That sounds like the ultimate way of 'spreading the word', and if Github does disappear, they will have made people more aware. Not to mention it won't affect people who have been doing this all along.",1356548393
4970386,comment,4967344,4969264,1,0,nnq,,,"It's not about what I know, it's just that I make a <i>real</i> effort to understand how the things that I do really work, at least at a basic concepts level. For example when I learned a bit about about how to cook I researched a bit about cooking chemistry, when I go to a foreign country I research a bit about the culture, religion and politics. And so on. And it's less effort than it seems. I think seeing knowledge in general as ""fun"" and just having fun knowing things for knowledge's sake makes your mind work in an entirely different way. Sure, you can google everything, half of what you know is very imprecise or false, and you forget half of the things you learn shortly after learning them. And having a mind rich in ""trivia"" may impair you in ""think fast"" situations and sometimes (though rarely) even make you seem ""slow"" because your mind is weighing extra facts and connections that may be irrelevant while others get faster to the solution because they don't even know these extra ""paths"" exist and don't waste time exploring them. But it simply makes you ""richer"" and in a weird way, <i>happier</i>, and not by inflated self-esteem that you know more than others. I know most people think along the lines of ""just live life, use stuff that works and enjoy"" but I just can't imagine living like this and I find it hard to have more than a superficial conversation with people that live and see the world this way. About the last paragraph, the answer is: there needn't be any answer. I just choose to think this way and I like people that think more like me and I will respect them more and favor them (even unjustly) in all situations. Maybe ""my kind"" (or at least the corresponding meme) will have higher chances of survival in the evolutionary game of life, maybe not, it's just the dice I ""choose"" to play :) (Disclaimer: yeah, ""you should"" should be ""I respect/favor you more if you"", and yes, I love good abstractions and UIs and I understand their value).",1356548389

The people in the book were members of a culture that taught that it was selfish to spend time and energy on your own needs. Your duty was to sacrifice your needs and your life for the ""greater good"". The ""moral"" was that there is nobility in taking charge of your own life and making what you want of it, and that, in fact, it is from doing so that the greater good benefits too. The slogan that captures it all: ""Your life is yours and yours alone. Rise up and live it.""<p>Not selfish: the main character in the book would give up everything for the woman he loved.

However, the fact that you want something does not mean you have <i>right</i> to have it - and I see no reason to accept the premise that access to the source code of a program created by somebody else is comparable to my right to life. I can not see where this right comes from - do I have the right to see all the source code in the world? Or just for the code I would like to use? Or maybe just for the code that does something deemed useful by the government? Or maybe just the code that was already seen by certain amount of other people?<p>What about source code that contains private data - do I have the right to see that too? What if the code contains access key to your bank account and you never intended for anybody but you to see it - do I have the right to see that?

4970318,comment,4966230,4968524,1,0,jamesmcn,,,"I think it is easy to see the <i>Sprawl</i> books as being technology-oriented with cyberpunk window dressing. If that is your perspective going in to <i>Blue Ant</i>, then I can see how you might be disappointed. The <i>Blue Ant</i> series makes it clear that Gibson is interested in contemporary humans and their culture. Technology informs these topics, but <i>isn't</i> the primary focus.<p>Going back to <i>Sprawl</i> after reading <i>Blue Ant</i>, new layers of detail became apparent to me. There is a <i>lot</i> more than just an AI-driven singularity story going on. If anything, the [Spoiler!] Neuromancer-Wintermute union is a McGuffin made too explicit, distracting many readers from the rest of the interesting content. Like Space Rastas. How awesome are Space Rastas?!<p>I found it easy to follow the Cayce Pollard thread in <i>Pattern Recognition</i>. Everything seems to develop around her or eventually relate back to her. In some sense, Cayce is a hybrid of Case from <i>Neuromancer</i> and <i>Marly Krushkova</i> in <i>Count Zero</i>. Bigend is a hybrid of Josef Virek (<i>Count Zero</i>) and perhaps the physical aspects of Armitage (<i>Neuromancer).<p>All of Gibson's books deal with characters that operate with relatively little wealth and power on the fringe of society and their interactions with figures of extraordinary wealth and power who have ambiguous locations within society. But these characters aren't just computer hackers / programmers. They can be marketing advisors, children, fashion designers, linguists, artists or mercenaries.<p>It is worth giving the </i>Blue Ant* series a second change, there is more in common with <i>Sprawl</i> than first appears.",1356547548

Like the latter, it presents itself as economic and scientific because it has big-sounding concepts like Law of Accelerating Returns [2] / Law of Accelerating Misery; both seem well reasoned, are slick, intelligent, and easy for smart people to believe in.<p>Now, Marx couldn't think of politics as independent from the interests of the capitalist class. That's why he failed, as Popper described: the New Deal, Social Security, public and subsidized education, progressive taxation... all those things came and made his prophecy fail. As in hindsight was to be expected, if only because prophecies rarely become true.<p>Today, Kurzweil can't think of biology as the vast, incredibly complex area that it is, and so his prophecy will fail when it's clear how difficult it is to achieve immortality, or full cybernetisation of the human mind, or general AI, or whatever. I am 90% confident in that outcome.<p>Yeah, we are not <i>hard wired</i> for religion, but still it's very easy to fall for it. Scientific reasoning is not and probably never will be the norm, if simply for the fact that we're just poor dumb chimps. After all, religion didn't stop appearing after 1900.

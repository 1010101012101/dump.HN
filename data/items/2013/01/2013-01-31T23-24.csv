Traditionally, the worst case scenario for NAT traversal is ""symmetric NAT.""<p>Symmetric NAT means that each tuple of (source_ip, source_port, destination_ip, _destination_port) gets its own unique (external_ip, external_port) tuple.  This is bad because it means that STUN is ineffective: your STUN server will see a different external port than what your actual destination would see.<p>Mobile data networks are actually <i>worse</i> than symmetric NAT.  Not only will your external port change based on your target, but your external IP likely will as well.<p>This makes NAT traversal, AFAIK, basically impossible.",1359676798

You also do not 'eval' the data to determine which fields to set on the string class.<p>You instantiate a known String type, and you feed it the string representation as an array of non-executable bytes using a method you specified when writing your code -- NOT a method the data specifies.<p>The data is not executable. It's an array of untrusted bytes.

I ended up using muse mode for emacs and fossil as an VCS (the wiki is particularly helpful for collecting resources).

Decisions were made in some other parts of the world, really really early morning calls and a general sense of frustration for all.<p>In a completely remote team, you are forced to optimize for coordination and communication. Obviously you suffer the downsides because there is no water cooler, no joint information dissemination sessions, no war room accountability though you can achieve some kind of co-creation using skype, join.me, git and trello. However you gain some big advantages in terms of finding the right resource at the best cost, undivided focus if remote team members are given work packages and ability to exploit the timezone difference for a 24hour work cycle. Not to mention the humongous personal flexibility which it affords at an individual level.<p>A point to note is that this remote vs. colo experience really can come down to the individual members and their personalities. There is no one size fits all.<p>TL;DR Go completely colo or completely remote, half-colo + half-remote = half-ass. Team personality is a very strong variable in this equation.",1359674753

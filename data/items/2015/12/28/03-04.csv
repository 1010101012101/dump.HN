Reserves and equipment represent real options, giving big-oil the right,but not the obligation, to extract in the future. Even if these costs cannot be recouped at the current market price, this has value because of oil&#x27;s volatility (just like stock options with exercise prices above current prices). The fall in oil price (and expected future prices) reduces the quantity of profitable real options, but plausibly not to zero.",1451275154

And has been for decades.<p>That doesn&#x27;t prove your idea correct; it&#x27;s likely the case we&#x27;re innovative despite patents, not because of them, because developers largely ignore them and just code whatever they want anyway.<p>> The scenario you are proposing is unrealistic because that&#x27;s not how the system works.<p>The system doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s rather the point; the entire software industry, which you&#x27;re going on about, largely ignores them, or collects them as weapons of defense against other companies.",1451275048

Robin Warren, Barbara McClintock and many others spoke for itself, and for a long time &quot;science&quot; essentially didn&#x27;t listen. I put &quot;science&quot; in quotes because &quot;science&quot; doesn&#x27;t speak or listen - scientists do - and the scientists shunned those luminaries (eventually to recognize them with one of the highest honours - the Nobel Prize).<p>Warren had to use himself as a test subject for others to notice. Shechtman was a cast out for years (and then it turned out that he wasn&#x27;t the first to notice 5-fold symmetry - he was just the only one for a long time to insist it&#x27;s real; the other &quot;scientists&quot; who noticed it cared too much about their status, rather than the science). McClintock was shunned by her peers and essentially lost her job -- though evidence for how badly she was treated by &quot;science&quot; for her radical ideas (now mainstream and assumed true) is being whitewashed.<p>I keep wondering how much progress we have lost because &quot;scientists&quot; (unlike &quot;science&quot;) does care how much you&#x27;ve raised, how much you&#x27;ve published, and who your friends are.<p>> anyone wanting to actually change the world in healthcare ... Science speaks for itself<p>The belief that modern healthcare is nothing but the application of science is also romantic and misguided. In the US, healthcare is a business and not even a free-market one. It is informed by science, most definitely. But e.g. no doctor will recommend the single most effective treatment for type 2 diabetes early in the disease[0] (calorie restriction whether directly, by direct fasting or intermittent fasting). In fact, it turns out that the American Diabetic Association recommendations are the everything <i>but</i> science, and possibly the worst you could do.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/12/type-2-diabetes-diet-cure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/12/type-2-d...</a>, see <a href=""http://www.ncl.ac.uk/magres/research/diabetes/reversal.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncl.ac.uk/magres/research/diabetes/reversal.htm</a> for references",1451275033

It takes longer to implement but once it is done, it&#x27;s done and easy to improve upon - it&#x27;s not fragile.<p>For hacking something together it might not be the way to go. But for a well thought out implementation of an app which interacts a lot with it&#x27;s backend, I think it&#x27;s the only way to go now.<p>I also feel like people will be missing the React wave at their peril. We&#x27;re on the verge of being able to cleanly abstract out an applications delivery mechanism whether its native, mobile, or web.

These industries are somewhat different.<p>For example, tech employment can be relatively robust for people in San Francisco and the Valley at the same time as Southern California&#x27;s entertainment production workers are losing their jobs to other US states which offer relatively large tax incentives to production companies and studios.<p>And, I think, as a point of comparison, it&#x27;s interesting that, in recent years, the California legislature handed the entertainment industry a large boost in tax credits for productions it kept in state (as opposed to competitors like Louisiana and Georgia).<p>And that&#x27;s an important difference. I haven&#x27;t seen the legislature giving, say, Yahoo, a special tax holiday if it can just get its act together and stop laying off people. And the state government&#x27;s reaction to Uber has not been particularly friendly either. I see some antagonism to Tech in state and local government. And the Tech industry is still viewed as a monstrously fat tax cow by the government.<p>Still, the article&#x27;s portrait of California as a &quot;bifurcated&quot; economy has some truth. The state contains a huge number of poor and middle class people who do not directly benefit from &quot;Software Valley&#x27;s&quot; jobs machine. (The main thing they receive from it is some government services paid for by taxes on that machine&#x27;s workers.)",1451274897

Too often people see &quot;retirement&quot; as &quot;waiting to die&quot; which is not a fair characterization.<p>People have asked me why I&#x27;m still working for other people, rather than pursuing my own interests. I ask myself that, and when I believe I&#x27;ll be happier doing that, I&#x27;ll take that path. But for now the kinds of things I like to play with (like large distributed systems with a tremendous scale) I can&#x27;t really afford to host something like that in my home laboratory. I could perhaps put a couple of thousand Rasberry Pi equivalent systems in custom racks of some sort, but the overhead of that is so much easier when its someone else&#x27;s job. Using AWS for experiments is fun but can be expensive for even short periods. So working at a company where they already need that level scale, and are willing to give me enough freedom to play with it (and even hire people to play with it with me ;-) it makes more sense for me to work for them.<p>That said a long time friend of mine retired from Cisco and now pursues the things he is interested in full time.

Perhaps every family and every child is unique, a non-reproducible n=1 experiment -- and perhaps, cast in those terms, it becomes a little easier to see just how wrongheaded the concept of a &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution for human beings might possibly be.<p>As far as I can tell, the most common objection to homeschooling is that it doesn&#x27;t work in the absence of parents who are interested and closely involved with the progress of their children -- not in the modern &quot;helicopter&quot; style borne only of a desire <i>not to be seen</i> to parent <i>badly</i>, but rather in a consistent and, to the extent possible, effective fashion, out of both genuine interest in the wellbeing and success of their offspring, and a sense of the duty to society which also inheres in parenting, that is, to bequeath upon the world children whose presence is more likely to be overall a benefit than a detriment. Or, to put it simply, that homeschooling can&#x27;t work reliably because it doesn&#x27;t work at all without good parents.<p>Unfortunately, as the last decades have also shown us, without good parents, nothing <i>else</i> works, either -- and a sufficiently broken system can easily overcome the effects of even the best parents, if only by being vastly larger than them and all but inescapable. Here we have a Yale professor telling us that the existing system is sufficiently broken -- and not really telling us anything we didn&#x27;t already know. Do we assume that nothing else can work either, and that our kids are doomed? Or do we seek alternatives, even those which are utterly alien to the sort of systems-first thinking that got us into this mess?<p>I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, of course, and I&#x27;m not raising any kids of my own, but it seems to me that the only option compatible with even the most basic concept of parental responsibility is the latter one. After all, we&#x27;ve not only seen ourselves that what we&#x27;ve got doesn&#x27;t work; here we have one of its highest exponents <i>telling</i> us it doesn&#x27;t work, which should be authoritative enough for just about anybody. Perhaps something else might work better? It&#x27;d be very hard for anything else to work <i>worse</i>.",1451273712

Most racist media does not advocate violence or death towards minorities; just discrimination and isolation, typically.<p>For example, probably one of the most popular racist websites out there is <a href=""http://www.dailystormer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailystormer.com</a>, and they have a large disclaimer:<p>>We here at the Daily Stormer are opposed to violence. We seek revolution through the education of the masses. When the information is available to the people, systemic change will be inevitable and unavoidable. Anyone suggesting or promoting violence in the comments section will be immediately banned, permanently.<p>You can find similar disclaimers on websites like Stormfront.<p>But lectures from people like al-Awlaki?

Obviously this crowd has problems!<p>But what&#x27;s interesting is that as I&#x27;ve been making friends who aren&#x27;t addicts, they have problems that are every bit as messed up as the recovery crowd.  There are two main differences, though: &quot;normal&quot; people are much more committed to hiding their problems (I feel as though I only learn about them because people assume I won&#x27;t judge them), and normal people don&#x27;t recognize that their unhappiness is a solvable problem.<p>Furthermore, most of them aren&#x27;t really into the solutions: a leveling of ego and pride, humility, rejection of desire and attachment, and living for something greater than themselves.  Addicts, of course, have no choice -- we either develop the skills and tools needed to be happy enough to stay clean, or wallow on in the misery of drug addiction, often to an untimely death.<p>It&#x27;s kind of sad, but I have no idea how to convince normal people that they can be happier by changing themselves instead of acquiring things or relationships or any other external thing they think will finally make them happy.<p>I feel as though erikpukinskis&#x27; comment about capitalism is a big part of the problem, but I&#x27;m not sure how to use that observation to help more people be happy.<p>Edit:  C&#x27;mon HN, we&#x27;re smart -- ideas on solutions to these problems are better than upvotes :-)",1451272286

I mean, they do control what you can and can&#x27;t install on your device, but they do so not in service of collecting more data on you, but in service of getting you to buy more stuff from them.   Because their money ultimately comes from you rather than from advertisers, they ultimately have different aims.<p>(if this is wrong, please correct me.)<p>This is relevant because Your whole thesis rests on the idea that the currently-popular business model of &quot;give consumers free stuff in exchange for personal data&quot;  will remain stable, that the &quot;advertising based&quot; model will win over the apple model.<p>And maybe it will.  I don&#x27;t know.   But right now?  it looks like the apple model has won the high end, while the &quot;give you stuff in exchange for your personal information&quot; dominates the low end.   Now, personally, I wouldn&#x27;t bet money that the current situation is stable;  in part <i>because</i> of this huge economic inequality, and <i>because</i> the people you really want as customers are paying for the services with money rather than with personal information.   There is an argument to be made that a lot of this personal data collected by the cellphone companies who make their money through collecting data is mostly personal data of the poor, because wealthier people use the cellphone company who charges you money.<p>I mean, you could be right, certainly, but my point is just that things haven&#x27;t settled out yet.

But some would leave the CWD in the download directory after an upload thus allowing you to send a file with the name of an external program then when you activate that program you have a shell.<p>The solution then still applies today: Don&#x27;t run external programs without sanitizing your environment. Quarantine all uploads. Don&#x27;t allow the remote client to control the filename of uploads.<p>And it&#x27;s not like Windows doesn&#x27;t have an executable bit on files.

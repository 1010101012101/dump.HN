If I was an investor, I&#x27;d bet on flipkart, solely based on watching the change in spending habits of the urban Indians over the last 5 years. Instead on narrowly focusing on the online business if you take a broad look at the way things are changing the tier 2/3 cities in India you&#x27;ll understand the investor optimism.

After thinking it over, I&#x27;m inclined to believe it matters what <i>type</i> of biking you&#x27;re doing. Your helmet usage should vary if you&#x27;re riding in the Tour de France or taking a NiceRide bike (rent by hour deal) around town. Ditto for riding in an area that very bicycle conscious (bike lanes, many bikers) vs not (busy street, curbed, etc).<p>If you&#x27;re just beginning cycling, please use roads that are bicycle friendly. Use a road with a wide shoulder or a bike lane and slow traffic. Don&#x27;t use the busiest curbed downtown street.<p>I speak as a severe traumatic brain injury survivor. I don&#x27;t take any unnecessary risk, explicitly to avoid the chance of re-injury. Growing up around helmets as the son of two ski patrollers, wearing a helmet is a part of life. It does not inhibit my riding and while drivers might be less careful around me, I won&#x27;t take that risk.<p>> Children and toddlers on foot are far more likely to receive traumatic brain injuries than cyclists<p>A traumatic brain injury is, at best, a severe concussion[1] and worst case can result in death or a coma that lasts for months.

8106432,comment,8103128,8103128,1,0,jonathanyc,,,"I am not too sure about all of this. I like the idea of some sort of format for specifying when long-running potentially blocking function calls might end, but creating an entire external package for that purpose feels to me a bit architecture-astronaut-like.<p>I did think it seemed nice as a pattern, but not as a library... then I got to the idea of a black box for context values. That really concerns me. If a function and a function called by that function both depend on some sort of parameter, why not just specify it as an argument like everything else? If it were somehow possible to only have request handling related functions for a specific application require a context value, that would make sense, but requiring <i>every</i> function called in the process of handling a request to have a ctx value as its first parameter? That seems dangerously infectious, and like using a rake to scratch an itch.<p>I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how libraries implement this in practice, but I hope most libraries will continue to just follow the simple, elegant route - if a function may block, document it, and let the caller handle putting it in a goroutine, instead of creating yet more boilerplate.",1406695738

Just 2 months ago, my little sister was riding on a bike with no helmet. She was struck by a car. She flew off the bike, puncturing a lung, breaking a clavicle, several bones in her face, ribs, road rash, etc. She stopped breathing at the scene. After 1 week on the ventilator, she began breathing on her own. We knew there would likely be brain damage. She woke up confused and showing most of the signs of traumatic brain injury. Fortunately just a couple months later she&#x27;s done with physical therapy. Due to nerve damage she will always have a little trouble walking, but most people won&#x27;t notice it. Her face didn&#x27;t need surgery since the fractures healed within millimeters of their original positions. The brain is the last thing to heal, and she is a different person than she used to be, most people who didn&#x27;t know her before won&#x27;t notice. She can&#x27;t yet hold a job or go to college. If she had been wearing a helmet it&#x27;s almost certain that she &quot;only&quot; would have to deal with the punctured lung and a few broken bones. Her not wearing a helment not only derailed her life, but it caused major problems in the lives of everyone around her. She has 250k in medical bills and the legal minumum on liability insurance here is 25k.<p>2. I snowboard regularly, I&#x27;ve seen people without helmets die on the groomed trails. I&#x27;ve hit my head a few times on logs that I really wouldn&#x27;t want to be running into w/o a helmet. I&#x27;ve never seen someone who was wearing a helmet permanently disabled by an accident.<p>I used to think that if you didn&#x27;t want to wear a helmet it was nobody&#x27;s business but your own. But when one of those cars hits you, somebody&#x27;s going to pay for those hundreds of thousands in medical bills, so if you don&#x27;t wear a helmet please file a DNR ahead of time.<p>On a &quot;lighter&quot; note, I tend to agree that as a society we should focus on the most dangerous things first. Right now I have a feeling that&#x27;s the intersection of driving and cell phones. We can probably save the most lives by focusing on driving safety.",1406694965

Mostly landed on my face, but the helmet broke and I was fine.  (An ambulance was driving by and took me to the hospital as a precautionary measure.  Somewhat convenient.)<p>The second time, I was riding a CitiBike without a helmet.  I hit a pothole and somehow ended up landing on my head.  I don&#x27;t really remember much, except laying in the middle of the road for a few minutes trying to figure out what happened.  (I do remember being pretty sure that this was the end.  But I decided I didn&#x27;t want to get charged for the missing bike, so got up anyway.)<p>The third time I was wearing a helmet again, but I landed on my hands.  It was winter so I was wearing gloves with leather palms, and just kind of slid for a while.  It was great.  I rode 40 more miles after that one.  (And I&#x27;m definitely a fan of gloves!)<p>Wear a helmet.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to fall off your bike, and you don&#x27;t really want to injure your head.",1406694953

On the other hand, I wasn&#x27;t aware of the rise of workbooks, that&#x27;s something I associate with education for younger children (say up to age 8 or 9). However, I&#x27;ma bit out of touch, since I finished school in 1987.<p>I would stand by my point about textbooks being more affordable in general, though. Compare introductory level university books on amazon.co.uk vs. amazon.com - I bought a lot fewer new programming books after I moved to the US because the ones were so expensive. If you look on the UK site you&#x27;ll see books priced similarly to the US, but you&#x27;ll also see &#x27;international editions&#x27; of the same book which cost only about 25% as much, and it is this pricing you&#x27;ll find in a typical bookstore. The only quality difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that paperbacks are more common over there, whereas American buyers seem to prefer hardbacks.<p><i>BTW, why do so many Irish schools require a school crest on their uniform?

The first year I was at the secondary school the uniform involved a round-neck sweater and open-collar shirt in the appropriate colors, but they switched to the more traditional v-neck sweater, shirt and tie to satisfy parents who thought the uniform wasn&#x27;t dressy enough compared to those of the other schools&#x27;.<p>I realize this seems like a bizarre expense but then I wonder why so many US schools have illuminated signage and heavily designed sports logos, semi-pro sports facilities and so on. different priorities I suppose.",1406694007

Here&#x27;s the problem: there are only so many potential ebook readers out in the world, and they only have so much time. This means there will be market saturation at some point, or at least market movement. This elasticity is there, for sure, but the relationship between price and purchases is not going to stay the same, especially as <i>everyone follows this advice</i>. Basically, everyone will price their books at $10 and the playing field will be level. Then the advice will be to price your book at $7. Then at $5. Then at $2. Then at $0.99 cents. This is the problem we currently see with Apple&#x27;s App store and the Google Play Store: too many apps, all priced similarly. For most apps, and probably for most ebooks it would almost be better to go in the exact opposite direction: one sale at $1000 is better than 10 sales at $1.<p>Also, why would Amazon care so much about how others market their content, to the point of trying to interfere? If your content is not worth $15, then nobody will buy it. If you suck at marketing, nobody will know to buy your (possibly great content). Why does Amazon get its hands dirty instead of simply giving you analytics-backed suggestions? Oh, that&#x27;s right, because controlling the publishers is more profitable for them, and using their market position as leverage against publishers is a great way to do so.",1406693424

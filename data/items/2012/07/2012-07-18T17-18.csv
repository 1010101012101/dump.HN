Oracle is, as another commenter put it, a corporate sociopath.  The inability to empathize is fine for a monopolist (and indeed, it's a terrific asset -- and after five months of working there, I concluded that it's the only thing that I think Oracle has any real talent for), but it's terrible for a technology company.  In particular, the inability for Oracle to see anyone other than themselves leads to decisions that don't just erode trust, they destroy it beyond all repair. What you are seeing here are the costs of Oracle's decisions:  it's what Oracle did to Hudson, to MySQL, to Java and to OpenSolaris.  If you honestly don't understand that -- if you truly believe in your heart that the dismissal of Oracle is somehow merely Occupy-esque anti-corporate sentiment -- then you yourself probably have an inability to empathize that should bode very well for your future career at Oracle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc#t=33m0s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc#t=33m0s</a>",1342632891

US 'planned attack on Taleban'<p>A former Pakistani diplomat has told the BBC that the US was planning military action against Osama Bin Laden and the Taleban even before last week's attacks.<p>Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, was told by senior American officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October.<p><a href=""http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article26410.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article26410.htm</a>
U.S. government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and recently posted on the website of the George Washington University National Security Archive shed some additional light on talks with the Taliban prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including with regard to the repeated Taliban offers to hand over Osama bin Laden, and the role of Pakistan before and after the attacks.[1]
...
It is already known that the U.S. had demanded in secret discussions with the Taliban that bin Laden be handed over for more than three years prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The talks continued until just days before the attacks, according to a Washington Post report the month following the attacks. But a compromise solution such as the above that would offer the Taliban a face-saving way out of the impasse was never seriously considered. Instead, State Department officials refused to soften their demand that bin Laden face trial in the U.S. justice system.<p><a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=80482&page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=80482&page=...</a><p>U.S. Rejects New Taliban Offer

They're harboring a terrorist and they need to turn him over.""<p>Couldn't Osama claim that he knew there were criminals in those buildings that he attacked and that there is nothing to negotiate about?",1342632847

For example:<p><i>""The pronounced convolution of the human cortex may be a morphological substrate that supports some of our species most distinctive cognitive abilities. Therefore, individual intelligence within humans might be modulated by the degree of folding in certain cortical regions. We applied advanced methods to analyze cortical convolution at high spatial resolution and correlated those measurements with intelligence quotients. Within a large sample of healthy adult subjects (n = 65), we detected the most prominent correlations in the left medial hemisphere. More specifically, intelligence scores were positively associated with the degree of folding in the temporo-occipital lobe, particularly in the outermost section of the posterior cingulate gyrus (retrosplenial areas). Thus, this region might be an important contributor toward individual intelligence, either via modulating pathways to (pre)frontal regions or by serving as a location for the convergence of information.""</i><p><a href=""http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/9/2019.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/9/2019.full</a><p>And:<p><i>When we examined the same regression model excluding ICV, some cortical measurements were associated with IQ frequently in frontal and temporal lobe. It might conclude that human intelligence is significantly correlated with the cortical complexity coming from brain size, rather than cortical shape itself. The combination of various cortical measurements explained 52.57% of IQ. The results showed that they were more useful for prediction of human intelligence than alone.</i><p><a href=""http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCECS2011/WCECS2011_pp428-432.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCECS2011/WCECS2011_pp428-4...</a><p>I'm not defending these particular papers.

Moreover, total brain volume is positively correlated with general intelligence, and both share a common genetic origin. However, although genetic effects on morphology of specific GM areas in the brain have been studied, the heritability of focal WM is unknown. Similarly, it is unresolved whether there is a common genetic origin of focal GM and WM structures with intelligence. We explored the genetic influence on focal GM and WM densities in magnetic resonance brain images of 54 monozygotic and 58 dizygotic twin pairs and 34 of their siblings. ... These findings point to a neural network that shares a common genetic origin with human intelligence.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/40/10235.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/40/10235.full</a>",1342632371

Your intuition upon seeing this visualization was pretty much right on: studying periodic functions is a way of understanding numbers.<p>> Or maybe what I've said is so obvious to someone who has studied math seriously that they just want to shout, ""Duh!""<p>Not so much.  It took some mighty smart folks to develop some ideas which are perhaps suggested, in hindsight, by this picture.  The big one is Fourier series and transforms, which allow you to decompose periodic functions into their constituent sine waves.  You can use Fourier analysis to get information about number theory, which was essentially your suggestion.  However, that's not at all obvious without seeing this picture.  Certainly, my first exposures to Fourier analysis were in the context of signal processing and solving PDEs.  I had absolutely no inkling that it may be useful for number theory until actually seeing it.  Even if I had seen this picture 7 years ago (when I knew signal processing and PDEs, but not number-theoretic applications), I probably would not have made the connection that you made.<p>So, I think your intuition was a rather non-obvious idea, and so your comment did not deserve the quick shoot-down.

The chain of events is predicated on the high cost of creating a semiconductor wafer.<p>Now if instead you can 'print' the circuitry, and you do mixed signal stuff. Then you can make your entire system as one board sized integrated circuit. Think an LCD television (transistors on glass) where instead of each transistor being the same you put a CPU and various other peripherals there. Size is not as important but yield still is.<p>So for things like phones/tablets, if you can do LED pixels (vs LCD) then you don't need the glass to be transparent (backlit) so you put down a layer of display, then a layer of compute, then a layer of memory, and finally a layer of radio.

They're not gels, but they're called aerogels because they're made from gels.  As the name ""aero"" implies, they're mostly air, giving them incredible strength-to-weight ratios and insulating properties.  Silica aerogels are translucent and quite amazing to hold; it's like holding a cloud.<p>Aerogels are made from colloids (a.k.a. gels), which are long chains of polymers formed in water.  Free-floating around in the water, they form very long, intricate, 3-D maze-like structures.  If you've ever made JELL-O, you've made (and eaten) a colloid.  Its the intricate structure of the colloid which keeps the suspended water from spilling out.<p>Silica aerogels are formed by removing the water from a silica gel, leaving only the maze like structure behind.  This structure is very delicate, and if you attempt to evaporate the water out near room temperature/pressure, the capillary action of water will collapse the structure like a dried out jellyfish.  However, if you heat and pressurize the system past the critical point, the water becomes a supercritical liquid and it can be removed without pulling the rest of the material inwards.<p>It appears that what theyve done here is similar, except they use a multi-step process to deposit carbon on the colloid, then remove the colloid completely, leaving nothing but a carbon maze.  I presume they can't make colloids out of carbon directly, hence the multistep process.",1342631410

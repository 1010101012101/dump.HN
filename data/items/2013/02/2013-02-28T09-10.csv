The second disk of five held hundreds of small report template files, and without a post-disk build defrag the install process for the second disk took a couple of hours instead of a few minutes.
For one release - you guessed it - I forgot the defrag on the second disk. I passed the disks to another guy for a test install, and later on in the day he test-passed the install set and send it on for duplication. Hundreds of floppy-disk sets were sent out to clients later that week, and then we started getting many irate phone calls about the  slow install process.
Turns out the testing guy had missed the slow install rate because he inserted the second disk, then went out to lunch for a couple of hours, and assumed everything had completed quickly when he returned.
Lesson learned - have a written checklist for generating installs / deployment (we didn't at that stage).",1362045103

It's just that some subset of keybindings will reset to their defaults every time you do a full power-down of the computer. Rinse and repeat until they're all back to their defaults.<p>It varies which hotkeys will be reset. Sometimes Metacity ones will reset. Sometimes GNOME bindings will reset. Sometimes opening the Unity configuration will reset the Metacity keys. Sometimes it doesn't! I even wrote a shell script to run all the proper `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface [blah]` incantations upon login, but when that didn't work reliably (again: Metacity keybindings vs. Unity appeared to be the problem) I gave up.<p>This has been my experience in Ubuntu 11.10, some mid-2012 version of Mint (with Cinnamon) and Ubuntu 12.10, so it's not strictly Canonical's fault. However they haven't seen fit to address it in their user experience, and so I portion out a slice of the blame for them.",1362042312

There is also no proof that that 2007 financial crises was orchestrated on purpose.<p>But we do know that Goldman Sachs sold financial instruments to their clients which they betted against. When the clients lost that money the profiteers was Goldman Sachs.<p>1. If you assume that the Rot Schild banks owned the entire English economy since June, 1815 and,  If you assume that the Rot Schild bank had a value of USD 1,000,000 at that time, growing at 5% per annum for 200 years it's value would be USD 17.2 Trillion.<p>If you also consider that the Federal Reserve has been leaking money into the shareholders of the FED at 6% of interest on bonds raised since 1913, and if Rot Schild banks were all part share holders in the founding banks of the Federal reserve this profit has been going to them.<p>If the Rot Schild banks were the major investors in Goldman Sachs, it would make sense for Goldman to loose their investors money and transfer it to their biggest investors directly through dividend.<p>We know from 1. above that the Rot Schild holdings should easily be USD 17 trillion + and that the valuations of the banks that went under was about USD 800 billion. Hence it is highly possible that the biggest investor in Goldman is bigger than all the rest combined.<p>The bitcoins are there for a reason much much more important I think.",1362042051

About half an hour before he goes up to bed, we sit down at the table and he dictates a journal entry about his day.  If he says something ungrammatical, like &quot;I go&#x27;ed to the library,&quot; I&#x27;ll say aloud, &quot;I went to the library&quot; as I write it down, so he picks up on it.  I&#x27;ve noticed, over the past six months or so that we&#x27;ve been doing it, that he&#x27;s gotten better at putting events in a sequence, and I think it&#x27;s helping to spark his imagination, too, because sometimes he&#x27;ll tell me fanciful things about his day that I know he didn&#x27;t actually do.",1386352703
6862441,comment,6861533,6862077,2,0,colomon,,,"Let me amplify your point with a specific, personal example.  I write Irish traditional-style dance tunes, reels & jigs, mostly.  I think I do a pretty decent job of it.  (Of course, I might be wrong about this -- certainly there are loads of bad, creative ideas!  Assume for the moment, though, that I actually am okay at it.)<p>As far as I know, the number of people who can play even one of the tunes I&#x27;ve written can be counted on your fingers.  It might take only one hand.  Like so many things, there are strong network effects in Irish tunes.  Most of the musicians want to play with other people; so there is limited incentive to learn a tune that almost no-one else knows.  When you do want to learn something novel, there are literally thousands of obscure tunes to choose from, with more being written every day.  And of course, since my tunes have not been professionally recorded, only a very limited number of people have ever been exposed to them; mostly close friends and a few people who heard me get up the nerve to play them in a bar somewhere.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to get at here is this is all perfectly reasonable.  If you looked at it from a narrow focus on me, then you could certainly say that creative ideas are being ignored.  But if you look at it from a broader perspective, you&#x27;d be wrong to conclude that all those musicians don&#x27;t like creativity.  Most of them are looking for something new to play.  There&#x27;s just no compelling reason it should be my tune.",1386352699
6862440,comment,6859323,6862326,1,0,DannyBee,,,"&quot;I&#x27;m a developer at a company that uses a lot of open source software, and I&#x27;ve spoken to other developers at other companies as well. Where I work, it&#x27;s required to get legal approval to use GPL software. Software under more permissive licenses may be imported and used freely at the discretion of the development team. So in my experience, InfiniSQL faces a much higher barrier to adoption due to GPL.&quot;<p>Interesting.  \nWe use about 8000 open source packages, and add roughly 90 a week right now.<p>&quot;Perhaps you work with companies where adopting technology stacks is more of a top-down decision where legal counsel is always involved. In those situations, GPL doesn&#x27;t pose a particular barrier because all open source software faces that same barrier. But some companies give more autonomy to their developers, and in those cases there&#x27;s a difference in overhead when managing GPL compliance.&quot;<p>Actually, i work at a company (Google) where autonomy is given.  People are free to use basically anything but AGPL.  We simply tell them what will be required of them if they use it, and enforce that this happens.<p>The overhead of GPL compliance is not any more than the overhead of any other license compliance, for us, in practice.<p>You still have to do stuff for BSD and MIT anyway, so you need a process that knows what is going into shipping software.<p>The short version is that:<p>Overhead is kept low by doing it as part of the same check-in process as any other source code (IE you don&#x27;t fill out some magical form and send it to lawyers), among other things.<p>Shipping time is simple verification that nothing changed (and the build system will verify it anyway).<p>My experience is that companies find GPL compliance overhead higher because they aren&#x27;t doing the right thing for other licenses anyway.  In particular, they never produce correct attribution for MIT/BSD/etc, so having to do &quot;anything at all&quot; is higher overhead.<p>This experience comes from reviewing a large number of companies for acquisition :)",1386352694
6862439,comment,6860986,6862296,6,0,lsc,,,">But I think if EC2 didn&#x27;t let you borrow CPU, nobody would use it because they would realize how absurdly underpowered EC2 offerings really are.<p>yeah, that&#x27;s pretty much the crux of virtualization;  it&#x27;s a lot like buying bandwidth.  Yes, your upstream is oversubscribing.   Yes, if they do this right, 99% of the time, you won&#x27;t notice the oversubscribe; you will get more service for less money vs. something that isn&#x27;t oversubscribed.   But, oversubscription needs to be managed carefully.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed? If your upstream has a 1000mbps line, and sells 1000 unlimited 10Mbps ports,  you are almost never going to see contention, even though it&#x27;s a 10x oversubscribe.<p>If your upstream has a 1000Mbps port, and sells 10 1000Mbps ports?   that&#x27;s the same 10x oversubscribe.  But I /guarantee/ that you will hit contention at least once a week.  Probably more often.  If people expect 1000Mbps reliable off that, they will be very unhappy.  (Of course, if you setup your QoS properly, and tell the customers that it&#x27;s 100Mbps CIR and up to a gigabit of best-effort burst? it can work out just fine.   But nobody is going to get a reliable full gigabit out of that deal.)<p>90% of your users are using like 10% of your resources.  But you&#x27;ve always got a few who are running torrents (or, in the case of CPU, mining primecoins)   In the 1000 10Mbps port situation?  it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you&#x27;ve got a few bittorrent users.   In the 10 users who can all completely fill the pipe situation?  it matters a /lot/<p>That&#x27;s the thing about CPU sharing, though;  most of the time you don&#x27;t put that many guests on one machine, and often you give each guest the ability to use the whole machine (when it&#x27;s otherwise idle)   - so you are in the situation of selling 10 1000Mbps links when you only have 1 1000mbps uplink, which ends in tears if anyone actually expects a reliable 1000Mbps uplink.  (Now, if everyone understands that it&#x27;s actually 100Mbps CIR that can burst to 1000Mbps, then sure, people can be happy.  but you have to be careful with those expectations.   With the 1000 10Mbps links on a 1gbps uplink, customers can treat their 10Mbps link as 10Mbps dedicated, and 99% of the time, they will get what they expect.)",1386352690

6862389,comment,6861533,6861533,2,0,Millennium,,,"People generally want to be convinced of an idea&#x27;s value before implementing it, and this is reasonable. For tested and tried ideas, this value is generally a known quantity, or at least one that can be estimated reasonably well. As long as that value is high, convincing people to do it is relatively easy: it&#x27;s mostly a matter of presenting that value in ways they&#x27;ll accept.<p>For untried (i.e. &quot;creative&quot;) ideas, this is much harder. Further complicating the process is that the creators of ideas inevitably place a very high intrinsic value on them. There are many reasons for this, but a lot of them are tied into the ego, either directly (&quot;I had this idea, so it&#x27;s good&quot;) or indirectly (&quot;This idea reinforces beliefs I hold, or advances a cause I favor, or lets me practice my favored hobbies, or may answer a question I&#x27;m personally curious about, etc., therefore it is good&quot;). Other people just plain don&#x27;t find these ego-tied arguments compelling, nor really should they, and so they cloud the process of convincing people to go along with a new idea.<p>It would seem, then, that the trick is to remove one&#x27;s ego from the convincing process, and argue solely based on what&#x27;s left. But the ego still complicates things. Even when more observer-independent arguments can be found, they never shine as brightly in the eyes of the creator as the ego-tied ones, and so it feels like you&#x27;re selling it short: not something creatives like to do, and for obvious reasons. Worse, though, are the many ideas that just plain don&#x27;t have many (or even any) arguments that don&#x27;t tie straight back into one&#x27;s own ego. No one else will ever be convinced to go alongside these, but to attack them is to attack the creator&#x27;s ego, leading to accusations of sour grapes and headlines like &quot;People don&#x27;t actually like creativity.&quot;",1386352161

Instead of just letting it stay there, she&#x27;d ask me questions about what she was reading, and then we&#x27;d make up our own stories that riffed on the same concepts/characters/settings.

That&#x27;s the advantage of having a standard.<p>I find this entire thread extremely interesting, and your comment gets to the heart of it.  <Reader alert - I work for SIF>. Because of some of the comments further down, I thought the following needed to be said.<p>SIF has a decades long history in this space connecting up educational applications conformant with the SIF standard into secure workable solutions (the &quot;IF&quot; in SIF stands for &quot;Interoperability Framework&quot;).  The SIF 3.0 release is a game changer for us, separating our  new extremely modular REST-based infrastructure from (in the US) the CEDS conformant SIF Data Model, and providing a clear migration path for the thousands of SIF deployments in schools, districts and states. If you&#x27;ve ever looked at SIF before, you really need to go to our website and look again.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s done.  :-)  Now here&#x27;s my source of confusion.  We are an non-profit standards organization with an open standard (written and approved by our members) that can be used without cost by all K-12 end users and vendors (members or not), and with no IP agreement to sign.  True there is an optional product certification program, but that involves only a nominal fee to cover our costs, and was created to support our end users who often demand products undergo SIF certification to ensure they will seamlessly interoperate (ideally out of the box - but there are a LOT of reasons including optional data elements, why things are often not that simple).  The Clever folks know what I’m talking about ... or they will soon.  :-)<p><pre><code>  In earlier SIF releases, when the infrastructure was basically home grown, several integrators wrote what we call “agents” which allowed vendors (including vendors of SIS, Library, Transportation and more recently Assessment  and LMS related systems) to essentially enable their applications run in SIF interoperability Zones without changing a line of code.  For example some agents use internal application database triggers to detect data changes the application publishes.  There are several free open source SIF Agent toolkits available today for SIF 2 and we expect the same for SIF 3 where the fact that the infrastructure is now based on REST will make things a lot easier.  Integrate your product with such an agent once, and you can deploy it everywhere the standard is used.\n\n  So we finally reach my question.  Some very smart people have invested $10 million dollars in Clever, but the stated business model seems (in SIF terms) to be to  \n  </code></pre>\n1. Create and establish an API to retrieve data from SIS applications and   \n2. Sell SIS vendors the agent software to allow them to utilize that API.<p>If that’s essentially correct (and if not, I would ask a Clever representative to correct me) than given our own experiences I just don’t understand how such a strategy can be effectively monetized to provide an acceptable return on such a large initial investment.  And I’m particularly interested, because if I knew how they were planning to do that, I’d try and get my employers to do that too! :-)",1386351669

All of which describe the opposite of creativity.<p>The reasons the systems are this way is due to our style of management, primarily in the US. Carrot-and-stick styles, with emphasis on short-term goals and comparison of employees to each other (bonuses for the top 5% etc) result in short-term thinking styles and discourage creativity in the workplace.

Although it has a good deal of the usual statistical ranting, it&#x27;s short and reasonably well-written. From the conclusion:<p>&quot;<i>Our results show that regardless of how open minded people are, when they feel motivated to reduce uncertainty either because they have an immediate goal of reducing uncertainty, or feel uncertain generally, this may bring negative associations with creativity to mind which result in lower evaluations of a creative idea. Our findings imply a deep irony. Prior research shows that uncertainty spurs the search for and generation of creative ideas, yet our findings reveal that uncertainty also makes us less able to recognize creativity, perhaps when we need it most.</i>&quot;<p>The key finding is two-fold: in a normal, non-uncertain, state, creativity has positive associations and is easier to recognize and assess. However, when people attempt to deal with an excess of uncertainty, creative ideas have negative associations.<p>That&#x27;s something to think about the next time everything is on fire.<p>Oh, and the final bit is interesting:<p>&quot;<i>In addition, our results suggest that if people have difficulty gaining acceptance for creative ideas especially when more practical and unoriginal options are readily available, the field of creativity may need to shift its current focus from identifying how to generate more\ncreative ideas to identifying how to help innovative institutions recognize and accept creativity.</i>&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1457&context=articles\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?ar...</a> [PDF]",1386351087

6862276,comment,6860991,6861447,3,0,computerslol,,,"It&#x27;s less about learning a new language, and more about learning a new framework.<p>As of .net 3.5, the .net framework contained 98 Assemblies, 309 namespaces, and 11,417 types. The framework is gigantic, and after you&#x27;ve spent long enough in .net, your domain specific knowledge of the framework itself is gigantic as well.<p>As someone who has been building applications on .net since beta, I have no fear at all in learning a new language (bring it on!). I have a fear of losing over a decade of experience with the thousands of classes provided in the .net framework that I use, and rely on, on a daily basis. I know exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, how it works, and what the performance ramifications are of each component I choose to use. I know what needs to be replaced with something custom to scale. I know what&#x27;s doing extra work I don&#x27;t need. I know the ASP.net page and control life-cycle (intimately), how the view engine works (and how to add features to it), how to replace critical components for custom functionality and how to build custom controls. I know the WPF layout system. I know the quirks in windows forms and GDI+. I know programmatic drawing in both frameworks. I have done machine learning in .net. I have done massive file IO in .net. I know the .net multi-threading model. I know how to do code generation in .net. I know how to use raw sockets in .net. I know how to bend this massive framework to my will, and get all of the performance and power I want out of it. I have built reliable, predictable, massive scale applications in .net. Over my entire career I’ve invited product managers to give me their crazy ideas, and I have never had to push back.<p>Having said that, I also don&#x27;t want to learn Ruby. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s mature enough to get my attention. I don&#x27;t see how it is in any way better (that&#x27;s not to say that it isn&#x27;t, I just don&#x27;t see it). Is it easier to learn? Maybe, but I&#x27;ve already crossed that hurdle; just like OP on reddit has. Is it a faster platform to blast out a simple website? Likely not for me. Is it a better platform for building and scaling massive applications? I doubt it.<p>Your language/framework defines the outer capabilities of your application, the performance of your application (read: scale), as well as what parts of your application can be reused from parts made available by others. They are things to be mastered. .Net takes a long time to master. The &quot;jack of all trades master of none&quot; attitude is what pains me. Show me that ruby is better for me in an area that .net is lacking and I&#x27;ll learn it. Show me that it&#x27;s better in all of the areas I care about and I&#x27;ll master it. That will be a hard sell. .Net is a fantastic platform; well organized, discoverable, consistent in quality, exhaustive in scale, performant, and still growing.<p>Will .net last forever? I don&#x27;t know. Older Microsoft technologies are still around and .net is still in active development. I don&#x27;t see Microsoft giving up the massive investment they have made in .net any time soon. Whether or not Microsoft stays relevant in web programming is up to them, and up to those of us using it.<p>As to startups using .net, I&#x27;ve worked for two. One provided a product that allowed you to order print ads made for your franchise. It accepted photoshop PSD files from designers, took them apart and allowed the ordering party to swap layers and text to fit their business, all with a WYSIWYG live-previewing interface. I wrote the original system myself in 2004 and the company is still operating today. The second was an online ad distribution company. The system I helped build was capable of targeting, serving, and tracking over 500 million ads per second at peak (a major accomplishment in 2008). The company is still operating today. I was not told what the companies did until after the interviews and pay negotiation. There was no way to know before I accepted the jobs whether or not they were &quot;cool&quot; jobs. Before starting my own business I was invited to work on a high frequency trading system built in .net. I turned it down, but they are doing very well. I&#x27;ve worked more for large businesses and mega-corps who also wouldn&#x27;t tell me the nature of the job they were hiring me for until I was hired. How do you know ahead of time if a .net job is cool when all you hear about it is “Senior .net developer needed”?<p>Is there a lack of marketing from MS extolling the values and virtues of .net on the server (especially for start-ups)? Yes. But that&#x27;s always the case with Microsoft. They are terrible at marketing. They will always be terrible at marketing. Should you be using .net at your start-up? That’s up to you. I’m using it for mine.",1386350979

6862259,comment,6859371,6859371,1,0,slinkp,,,"I’d put it a bit more broadly: The state of working with Python packages has been painful for many years, and despite recent improvements and ongoing heroic efforts to fix things (thanks Tarek in particular), it’s still not much fun. Piling on hate doesn&#x27;t help anybody though.<p>There’s some history worth considering. LXC requires Linux >= 2.6.24, released 24 January 2008. Virtualenv was released in October 2007. So LXC was hardly an option at the time.<p>Virtualenv was, I think, a pretty good attempt at a pragmatic solution for purely python-related dependency management issues at that time. I found it a hell of a lot easier and quicker than chrooting or building a whole new python installation (I used to do that) or using (shudder) zc.buildout. System-level virtualization was pretty heavyweight in 2007.<p>I think maybe virtualenv is showing its age a bit; I agree with that the system library isolation issue is a huge hole in the virtualenv approach. But often, it’s enough to get work done.<p>As for pip vs. easy_install, anybody who was around at the time (sorry I can’t tell from the pythonrants blog if that includes &quot;Adam&quot; or not) remembers that life with easy_install was horrifically painful. It was buggy, often failed with completely unhelpful messages, and issues with it (and setuptools more generally) were simply not getting fixed at all. For _years_. (That is finally changing more recently, thankfully.) Pip was intended to route around all that (while still using setuptools internally) by doing less and by having less painful failure modes. As one example: if you tried to easy_install a bunch of packages, or one package with a bunch of dependencies, and one somewhere in the middle failed because it couldn’t find a dependency, you’d end up with a fucked environment that had half of the packages installed and half not. And since there was no easy_uninstall, you had no easy way to clean up the mess. And you wouldn’t even have any easy way to know what actually depended on the dependency that failed to install. Pip took the much nicer approach of downloading everything, resolving all dependencies, trying to tell you what depended on something that couldn’t be found, and building everything before installing any packages at all. So if there was a failure prior to the installation phase, it had no effect on installed libraries at all. It’s hard to overstate how much pain relief this provided.<p>For another example: setuptools and easy_install allow installing different versions of the same package into the same python environment at the same time. I’m not sure why that was ever considered desirable, because every time it actually happens, it’s been a source of nothing but pain for me and didn’t even seem to work as advertised. Pip took the opinionated approach that only one version should be installed and if you want different versions for some other application, just go build a separate environment for it (virtualenv or no).<p>I agree that the –no-site-packages vs. –system-site-packages options to virtualenv are problematic, but for me that’s largely because it amounts to a binary choice between having to build all C extensions from scratch vs. having to depend on whatever happens to be installed system-wide, which is a pretty poor choice to have to make.<p>As for the statement that “there’s little real danger” because “their virtualenv will always be on the path first”, he&#x27;s forgetting (or possibly doesn’t know) that the easy_install.pth file messes with sys.path as well. I had several hair-tearing sessions trying to figure out why on earth the wrong version of some package was getting imported before I realized that. At one point I found that import behavior changed depending on which version of setuptools or distribute I had installed. That was fun.<p>It’s also true that people often misuse requirements files. I don’t think that’s the fault of the tool. Depending on the current commit of some master or other branch is idiotic regardless of what mechanism you use. Depending on a specific tarball URL is no more or less reliable than depending on a specific package version being available via pypi (hasn&#x27;t everybody had the experience of somebody yanking away a package version you depended on?). The right thing to do is probably neither, but to host all your dependencies somewhere that you control (whether that’s your own python package index or .deb or .rpm server or whatever).",1386350838

6862232,comment,6859767,6860115,5,0,jeffdavis,,,"There is a huge difference in the sophistication between what you describe and what a traditional SQL system like Postgres does.<p>The problem with just mmapping files is that, to sync, you have to do a bunch of random writes. To commit two transactions, you have to jump two places in the disk and do two writes. You can defer them, but then your transaction commit latency goes up dramatically. So the user is between a rock and a hard place: uncertain durability for extended periods of time, or long commit latency.<p>Compare that to a system based on a Write-Ahead Log (WAL). The log is 100% sequential (and often preallocated in large chunks), and a transaction is durable if the log is flushed up to some certain point. All transactions go into the same log, so under high concurrency, one flush to disk might commit several transactions. And even if you flush for each transaction, at least you don&#x27;t have to jump around on disk (and, if using a controller with battery-backed cache to reduce latency, you can make do with a fairly small cache).<p>The writes to the main data area can be deferred for a long time (30 minutes might be normal), and syncing those is called a checkpoint. You can spread the checkpoint out over time (it&#x27;s a continuous process, really) so that they don&#x27;t cause transaction latency spikes. Deferring the writes for so long allows the writes to be scheduled more efficiently without sacrificing durability at all.<p>On top of that, if you are OK with small windows of time before the commits are durable, postgres allows you to choose <i>on a per-transaction basis</i> not to wait for the WAL flush before returning to the client. If you crash, you are guaranteed to be consistent still, and if a normal transaction comes along, it will of course force a WAL flush. You can control the window of time before postgres will force a WAL flush, where 200 <i>milliseconds</i> might be normal. It can be a small number and still gain you a lot because it&#x27;s just writing a sequential log, so there&#x27;s no need to defer it for multiple seconds.<p>In other words: Mmapping files gives you a choice between very short commit latency and long periods of uncertain durability; or long commit latency. WAL gives you a choice between very short commit latency and short periods of uncertain durability; or short commit latency.<p>I understand ArangoDB is new. The description sounds interesting, and I like some things about the goals. But I think it&#x27;s way off the mark to tout the durability as offering a nice trade-off, when a much better method (at least for OLTP) has been known for two decades[1].<p>[1] Basic idea introduced by ARIES paper in 1992.

6862230,comment,6859371,6859371,1,0,slinkp,,,"<p><pre><code>    I’d put it a bit more broadly: The state of working with Python packages has been painful for many years, and despite recent improvements and ongoing heroic efforts to fix things (thanks Tarek in particular), it’s still not much fun. Piling on hate doesn&#x27;t help anybody though.\n\n    There’s some history worth considering. LXC requires Linux >= 2.6.24, released 24 January 2008. Virtualenv was released in October 2007. So LXC was hardly an option at the time.\n</code></pre>\nVirtualenv was, I think, a pretty good attempt at a pragmatic solution for purely python-related dependency management issues at that time. I found it a hell of a lot easier and quicker than chrooting or building a whole new python installation (I used to do that) or using (shudder) zc.buildout. System-level virtualization was pretty heavyweight in 2007.<p><pre><code>    I think maybe virtualenv is showing its age a bit; I agree with that the system library isolation issue is a huge hole in the virtualenv approach. But often, it’s enough to get work done.\n\n    As for pip vs. easy_install, anybody who was around at the time (sorry I can’t tell from the pythonrants blog if that includes &quot;Adam&quot; or not) remembers that life with easy_install was horrifically painful. It was buggy, often failed with completely unhelpful messages, and issues with it (and setuptools more generally) were simply not getting fixed at all. For _years_. (That is finally changing more recently, thankfully.) Pip was intended to route around all that (while still using setuptools internally) by doing less and by having less painful failure modes. As one example: if you tried to easy_install a bunch of packages, or one package with a bunch of dependencies, and one somewhere in the middle failed because it couldn’t find a dependency, you’d end up with a fucked environment that had half of the packages installed and half not. And since there was no easy_uninstall, you had no easy way to clean up the mess. And you wouldn’t even have any easy way to know what actually depended on the dependency that failed to install. Pip took the much nicer approach of downloading everything, resolving all dependencies, trying to tell you what depended on something that couldn’t be found, and building everything before installing any packages at all. So if there was a failure prior to the installation phase, it had no effect on installed libraries at all. It’s hard to overstate how much pain relief this provided.\n\n    For another example: setuptools and easy_install allow installing different versions of the same package into the same python environment at the same time. I’m not sure why that was ever considered desirable, because every time it actually happens, it’s been a source of nothing but pain for me and didn’t even seem to work as advertised. Pip took the opinionated approach that only one version should be installed and if you want different versions for some other application, just go build a separate environment for it (virtualenv or no).\n\n    I agree that the –no-site-packages vs. –system-site-packages options to virtualenv are problematic, but for me that’s largely because it amounts to a binary choice between having to build all C extensions from scratch vs. having to depend on whatever happens to be installed system-wide, which is a pretty poor choice to have to make. \n</code></pre>\nAs for the statement that “there’s little real danger” because “their virtualenv will always be on the path first”, he&#x27;s forgetting (or possibly doesn’t know) that the easy_install.pth file messes with sys.path as well. I had several hair-tearing sessions trying to figure out why on earth the wrong version of some package was getting imported before I realized that. At one point I found that import behavior changed depending on which version of setuptools or distribute I had installed. That was fun.<p><pre><code>    It’s also true that people often misuse requirements files. I don’t think that’s the fault of the tool. Depending on the current commit of some master or other branch is idiotic regardless of what mechanism you use. Depending on a specific tarball URL is no more or less reliable than depending on a specific package version being available via pypi (hasn&#x27;t everybody had the experience of somebody yanking away a package version you depended on?). The right thing to do is probably neither, but to host all your dependencies somewhere that you control (whether that’s your own python package index or .deb or .rpm server or whatever).</code></pre>",1386350615

One of those systems is still running actually, on the same old hardware without changes to the software.

On the other hand, a dullard who comes up with a million dollar idea that&#x27;s demonstrably risk free, has delivered equal value.<p>What happens when the innovator presents the ten million dollar idea to a room full of dullards? After several such episodes in succession, they&#x27;ve persuaded themselves that the dullards hate innovation.<p>Blaming people for being risk-averse isn&#x27;t good enough.

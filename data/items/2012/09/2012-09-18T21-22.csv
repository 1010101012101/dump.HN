And you were at least half right in that those are only part of the design patents asserted.  The problem is that Apple really did argue that rounded rectangles were a protected design element.  While you can argue over how big a part of the design patents that was, it was something Apple's own lawyers argued over at trial.<p>So the facts are that they claimed to own that idea in court and that some people think that was absurd.  Everything else is a matter of opinion, especially the matter of how important those claims are to the design patents.  So you're free to disagree how important that feature of the design patents was.  But other people are also free to say that when they argue it in court, it's fair game for criticism.

4540730,comment,4539251,4540013,1,0,dkarl,,,"The second link is not a good example of C++ imposing a cost for something you don't use.  It's just a bad performance trade-off in std::string.  The standard library types aspire to be useful in a wide range of performance-sensitive applications, but if they don't work for you, you are free to use alternatives.  Programmers at my company use a variety of C++ containers that are faster than the STL containers for particular uses.<p>The first link is a reasonable example of paying a cost for something you might not use.  However, I disagree with the article when it says there's no good reason for it.  People really do compare function pointers for equality.  A common example is when different functions implement different ""strategies"" (to use the GOF term.)  A simulation might customize the behavior of simulation objects using pointers to different strategy functions, and you might compare the pointers to find all the simulation objects that follow a particular strategy, or to check whether two objects use the same strategy.  Since implementations are free to inline functions that are not declared ""inline,"" there would be no valid way to compare function pointers if an inlined function could have different addresses in different translation units.<p>Adding performance at the expense of sanity should be voluntary, not the default behavior.  (It definitely counts as insanity if comparing &my_handy_function and &my_handy_function for equality returns false in a language where function pointers are the only way to treat a function as data.)  Anyone who is picky enough about performance to be concerned about link time is on intimate terms with their implementation(s) anyway, so I think it's perfectly acceptable for such an optimization to be available through non-standard flags.  Although, if any language were to standardize insanity, perhaps it would be appropriate for it to be C++.",1348005194

This is in no way unique to a game like Rochard, it'd apply equally much to $0.99 iPhone games or AAA games launching on all platforms and needing to sell 3 million copies to break even.<p>In this case the original target market was the PS3 store, and my understanding is that the very highest selling indie games there have lifetime sales in the half million unit range. And the sales figures are likely obeying a power law, with the median sales in the thousands of units. It does seem like a pretty horrible place to be selling to.<p>For Rochard, we can try to make a rough estimate of the cost. First of all the studio making the game was formed for an overly ambitious project (Earth No More), which was scrapped after several years. Mostof the team dispersed, but a skeleton crew started on a new game, and shipped Rochard  around 1.5 years laters. The credits show 15 people, but I doubt they would all have been on the project full time. So let's guess 10-15 man-years of work.<p>On the funding side, clearly they won't have had much if any money left at the start of the project. Early on they sold some part of the rights to the game to an outside investor for 400kEUR.<p>Even if we ignore overhead, the cost of things like voice acting, and assume Finnish pay levels, it seems clear that the team wasn't working for full market salaries. Maybe they just really wanted to work on games rather than CRUD apps. Or they all had significant equity, and were hoping to hitting it big with that 1% surprise hit.<p>Judging by Rochard not appearing on the top 20 most sold lists on the PSN, it seems like a fair bet that it did not make a profit there. I don't know whether it flopped completely or had mediocre sales. For the purpose of making money, it doesn't really matter. There's a good chance that they'll make more from the Humble Bundle than from PSN. Even so, it doesn't look like a project that would have broken even for the investors, or for anyone working on it at below market wage.<p>(Edit: Which is a shame. It was one of my favorite games last year, and I certainly didn't mind paying for it again as part of the bundle).",1348003455

I definitely agree that the visual styling of Yahoo! remains in a web 1.5 era and I'm sure Marissa Meyer will have her fair share to say about it in the coming months. After all, Google's famous white background is largely considered one of Marissa's influences.<p>Other than the design aspect - Yahoo!'s web technology is largely, for the lack of a better word, 'adequate'. Their search bar searches well (powered by Bing), their mail client sends mail, and Flickr is still a great service for image consumption and storage.<p>What of their 'lifestyle' or 'media' portals? For instance Yahoo! Answers, Finance, Auto, Sports (Fantasy Sports as well as Sports news) etc? These are all great Yahoo! product areas in their own right. What do you think users would say to Yahoo! making a media play similar to what AOL has done?<p>One gripe of mine is Match.com, another Yahoo! property. It seems largely untapped. It isn't widely branded as part of the Yahoo! portfolio (lacking the trademark Yahoo! Purple design scheme, for one), and it seems it has largely operated independent of its parent company in the past.

By that logic than doing anything is doing Agile and we know this is not true. If it were true, you could do waterfall and if that works for you, then it's Agile. Which is just silly.<p>This is not to say that the stand-up must be exactly as described in Scrum or elsewhere, but the key is that you have the Agile mindset and understand why you're doing the thing you're doing.<p>For example, the stand-up is a short and focused meeting where teams co-ordinate and get on the same page (which means it's NOT a status meeting).<p>We stand to keep the meeting short and focused. If you keep the meeting short and focused, then it doesn't matter if you're standing or sitting. Far too often, teams choose not to stand, lose sight of keeping the meeting short and focused, and transition to having long, boring, status meetings that aren't very useful.<p>If you choose to have tea before your stand-up, then have a short and focused meeting where everyone gets on the same page, then you're fine. If you're having wandering conversations that go nowhere or on wild tangents and never really seem to accomplish much of anything, then you've probably missed the point.<p>I have a video course dedicated entirely to the daily stand-up, good and bad habits, and how you can use Improv to get everyone focused, energized, and listening before the meeting.

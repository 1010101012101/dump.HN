The issue isn&#x27;t whether you are right or wrong, whether the comment is political or non-partisan.

If you only fix one thing, this should be it.<p>- Everything is squished together. White space is your friend. Use lots of padding. I recommend a grid system of some sort. 960.gs is good for non-responsive websites and easy to use and understand. If you wanna to responsive check out Foundation or Bootstrap&#x27;s grid system. Though I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary.<p>- The colors aren&#x27;t working. Especially the border colors on the box. Way too harsh with the mellow background. I&#x27;d look at a site like ColorLovers or Adobe Kuler to get nice pallets.<p>Useful resources:<p><a href=""http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-for-the-web"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to...</a><p><a href=""http://nicewebtype.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nicewebtype.com/</a><p><a href=""http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography</a><p><a href=""http://webtypography.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webtypography.net/</a><p><a href=""http://alistapart.com/article/on-web-typography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alistapart.com/article/on-web-typography</a><p><a href=""http://colorlovers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colorlovers.com</a><p><a href=""http://kuler.adobe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kuler.adobe.com</a>",1375681718

I don&#x27;t recall the circumstance but an indent that was off just a bit did not cause the compiler to complain, but did cause it to generate code that I did not intend.

To be honest, I think it&#x27;s just an etymological problem: &quot;reduction&quot; sounds bad, so &quot;reductionism&quot; sounds bad.<p>The grandparent here follows this pattern.

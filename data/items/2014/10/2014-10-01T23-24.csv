My cofounder and I haven&#x27;t agreed on which is better for the YC app, so I would really appreciate your opinions.<p>1) In middle school, I devised a simple cipher and gave a key to a couple friends to memorize. Using the cipher, we&#x27;d pass encrypted messages on a calculator which we were allowed to share in math and science classes. While our classmates were punished for passing notes, we continued to use our system safely throughout high school.<p>2) When I was still in college, newly married, and very poor, our apartment had some furniture but very few electronics. McDonalds had a Monopoly promotion where some menu items would include game pieces and at least $1 in store credit for Best Buy. The rules had no restrictions against using multiple &#x27;Best Buy Bucks&#x27; in a single transaction.<p>I was able to work out a deal with some McDonalds managers that if I purchased a certain amount, they would give a few extra containers for free. Large fries were the lowest cost per game piece, so I would order 10-20 at a time and receive a few empty cases for free. We&#x27;d give what we couldn&#x27;t eat to the homeless around Santa Monica, but kept the containers.<p>I kept all of the Best Buy Bucks and sold the unpeeled game pieces on Ebay. With the free cases, I would break even on the initial investment and repeat the cycle.

So that&#x27;s definitely a big change from the 10mbit DSL lines we had 5 years ago.<p>And the 50mbit domestic connections wasn&#x27;t at all common 20 years ago (heck, we did have 33.6kbps dial-up and it cost a fortune). In fact, if you say that there haven&#x27;t been large, fast changes in bandwidth terms then I&#x27;d invite you to revisit the following facts:<p>- Smartphones in every pocket, with people consuming 1-2 GB a month. This was unthinkable 7 years ago — and I vividly recall spending a ton of money because I used 1 GB of mobile internet.\n- 4G in every corner — just a few years ago the top was the 384kbps UMTS\n- FTTH and DOCSIS 3.0 ubiquitous, mainly to lowered costs for fiber equipment, GPON lowers the cost and tougher fiber cables that can easily be installed in houses\n- Ten-fold growth in internet provides bandwidth… or more. For example, <10 years ago, OVH&#x27;s network (one of the largest dedicated server providers in the world) was one of the largest at 300Gbps (I remember the party when they reached out that capacity!). Now they are at +3Tbps and growing.\n- 1080p and 4K increasingly common — and then a decade ago we were still buying CRT televisions, a far cry from the FHD and higher bitrate contents<p>I could keep going with the list… But the fact is: everywhere you look bandwidth is getting cheaper AND faster, same goes for consumer devices that profit said bandwidth (TVs, smartphones…) and that comes in hand with more, richer content.",1412206380

Realistically, I could afford maybe 1 hour/day of practice (and even that would be a bit of a stretch, probably closer to 3-4 hours/week) which would mean Carnegie Hall wouldn&#x27;t happen for another 27 years.  I think more than anything, the proliferation of the &#x27;10,000 hour rule&#x27; was very depressing for me, as a small part of the enjoyment of practicing my various hobbies comes from dreaming about the possibilities, and when you break down the numbers, those dreams become highly improbable (i.e. impossible).<p>I think a better &#x27;rule&#x27; would be as follows, largely from my own anecdotal experience and observations with a number of instruments, sports, programming, and other hobbies:<p>10&#x27;s of hours = functional;\n100&#x27;s of hours = proficient;\n1000&#x27;s of hours = professional level;\n10000&#x27;s of hours = world class;<p>As is noted elsewhere in this thread, these numbers are highly variable and dependent on genetics, previous experience, and practice strategies.  But I think this is a better way to frame skill acquisition, its a bit more friendly and realistic.  I would like to think that after a couple hundred hours of practicing a new instrument, I would be good enough to jam out in front of a small crowd in a shitty bar.

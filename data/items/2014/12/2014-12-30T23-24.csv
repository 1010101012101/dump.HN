Almost the entirety of the page rendered is user-generated content produced from hand-written wiki markup that must be parsed and rendered, and that uses complex nested templates. MediaWiki is basically a turing-complete applications platform. The wikipedia page for Barack Obama transcludes 199[0] <i>unique</i> templates, with 585 total non-unique invocations, and that&#x27;s not counting the templates transcluded by those templates.  Some of Wikipedia&#x27;s templates are so complex that they had to be rewritten in Lua.<p>I don&#x27;t think Wikipedia is really a typical case.

8817514,comment,8812724,8814041,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Perhaps a better example of the Microsoft strategy would be Windows itself. For many years and several major versions, they went to extraordinary lengths to ensure backward compatibility and stability, so software that ran on Windows from the mid-1990s would still have a reasonable chance of running acceptably on Windows in the late-2000s.<p>We had <i>almost</i> reached the point where, notwithstanding any commercial licensing barriers, you could either still run application software natively, or it was so old that you could host a virtual machine containing the old OS within the new one. That&#x27;s a great situation to be in if you rely on the software, and it&#x27;s also a very nice situation if you write software, because it basically means that once you&#x27;ve got software that works it works forever. A firm foundation keeps everyone safe.<p>It&#x27;s regrettable that under Ballmer and now Nadella they seem to have been pushing hard in IMHO the wrong direction with increasingly rapid updates and more reliance on inherently unstable on-line services, instead of playing to those traditional strengths. This makes Windows just as unlikely a prospect for long term stability as anything from Apple or the Linux world these days.<p>Personally, all I want is a system that I can buy today to do useful work and reasonably expect to still be doing useful work more than a year or two later. It&#x27;s disturbingly difficult to find software that meets that apparently simple requirement any more.",1419983970

But it&#x27;s possible that the moral arithmetic still works out to significantly greater average harm.<p>We should also think about the potential benefits in the same way.

In fact, back in the days when I used to frequent the darker side of things most hacking forums would change addresses monthly/weekly/sometimes daily. A lot of various hidden sites are ad hoc communication platforms, put up and taken down as needed.

Popularity might well be some of it, but I think that effect&#x27;s worn off by now.<p>I think the main reason has to do with score estimation.  With chess, you can say that a queen is worth 8 points and a rook is worth 5 and a bishop&#x27;s worth 3, and get a quick idea of who&#x27;s winning a game.  In Go, every piece has the same value, and whether a stone is useful depends on which other stones it&#x27;s connected to, and whether those stones are going to be alive at the end of the game.  So just to work out whether you&#x27;re winning, you have to be able to do search all the way to the end of the game and work out who wins!  And computers have been getting that process wrong until recently.<p>The extra search space doesn&#x27;t make Go harder for humans too, because humans play both Chess and Go very differently to computers.  A human never tries to calculate the value of a million possible moves, so the question of how many million possible moves there are to search through just isn&#x27;t relevant to a human.  Humans play both Chess and Go largely using pattern recognition and insight in a way that computers are not currently able to model.",1419983452

Every time documentation or a tutorial asks you to insert AWS keys, your response should be &quot;let me go create a role for that&quot; rather than &quot;let me go look those up&quot;.<p>2. More importantly, if you ever accidentally publish or leak credentials, don&#x27;t try to clean it up by deleting those commits. <i>Invalidate the credentials immediately</i> and re-issue them.<p>3.

In contrast, tools for compiling and statically linking code from different languages are rare, assuming you&#x27;re even talking about languages that compile and link statically in the first place. Often the best you&#x27;ve got is hoping that each language can generate object files using the same probably-C-based ABI, making it possible to statically link them assuming that the various run-time systems are then set up correctly by the code itself.",1419982736

If you close the hand before you move to the ball, you don&#x27;t pick up the ball, you just close on air.<p>So, in Haskell (if I had the hardware control libraries), I could put that in a monad to guarantee the sequence, and in an IO monad so that I could do things that had side effects like affecting the external world.

That&#x27;s like saying making a talk show is free if it doesn&#x27;t pay for the interviews.<p>>>> Money is not an issue of survival for Wikipedia<p>It&#x27;s incorrect again - the fact that Wikipedia has money doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t need it. Just as the fact that you have enough air to breathe right now doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t die very quickly if the air flow stops. Wikipedia would die too if the money flow stops. Fortunately, it does not, and it&#x27;s the great thing, and it in no way means money flow is not vital - just as the abundance of air doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not vital for you.<p>>>> is in “survival” mode.<p>Here you engage in distortion, making it sound like Wikipedia claims it&#x27;s &quot;in survival mode&quot;. The claim is the donations are necessary for continued survival, not that there&#x27;s already a financial crisis now. In fact, since the kind contributors continue to contribute, there is no crisis. This is a good thing.<p>Moreover, the only reason this is the case is that people in the past mostly were not listening to people like you. So you build your case on the fact that almost nobody would join your cause.<p>>>> Wikipedia’s core software is essentially unchanged since 2001<p>This is wildly untrue, to the point that betrays complete unfamiliarity with the platform and it&#x27;s development. Which is much more puzzling given that most of the information about it is not that hard to find if desired.<p>>>>  Yet all of the money spent on programmer salaries has produced no measurable change to the site’s quality.<p>This again is false. The very article you&#x27;re reading belies this claim, but there are many more improvements (including whole mobile platform, which of course did not exist in 2001).<p>>>> These grants have been described as “corrupt” by the WMF’s ex-director Sue Gardner. who said,<p>This is an obvious lie, Sure Gardner said that the process doesn&#x27;t provide enough protection against corrupt practices, not that the grants are corrupt. The difference as between &quot;this lock is not strong enough&quot; and &quot;you are a thief&quot;. It is bewildering that you distort the quote in the same phrase as you provide it and expect the reader to miss it.<p>>>> Your donations are going to golden chairs.<p>This is false. Ask somebody who has been in Wikimedia office if there are any golden chairs there.<p>>>> I guess parks and libraries would be a lot less popular if you had panhandlers at the doors.<p>You would prefer wikipedia to tax you and have corrupt politicians distribute the budgets instead of direct voluntary donations? That&#x27;s s strange mindset that prefers to be forced to do something instead of having a choice to do it at their own free will - or not do it and write an article full of distortions and inaccuracies if so inclined.<p>I could spend more time to point more incorrect statements and fallacies in the text but I think this is enough.",1419982131

Some use DNS, some use IP addresses, some do a combination of both. This was all discussed by a judge in one of the court cases.<p>>Also, most of the work to get sites blocked via court order in the UK (not by some secret lobbying deal, but through the courts) has been done by the music industry, not the MPAA.<p>Through the courts, yes, but this is a mere formality. The ISPs put up a token defence and then promptly capitulated.<p>Even then, they already had the systems in place for this censorship precisely due to secret lobbying deals and strong-arming by the government (who knew that any legislation they brought forward would quickly run up against lots of opposition both politically and legally) - see the situation with the IWF and the porn-blocking stuff.<p>There&#x27;s a reason an IFPI spokesperson said &quot;child porn is great!&quot; at an industry conference.

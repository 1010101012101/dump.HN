mobileize,1,"MOBILEIZE  The Drive to Purchase Platform [Integrated with Facebook, Twitter, NFC etc.] Patent Pending.<p>Mobileize connects advertising to purchase locations. We are an innovative cloud based mobile marketing platform that allows brands and retailers to influence purchase behaviour by connecting any communication (on or off-line) to a physical location using any device with an html5 browser (smartphone, tablet, laptop, PC).<p>Please experience the platform for yourself on your mobile\nhttp://fullers.mobileize.co.uk/?find<p>Please see link to our a short Sales Presentation deck to provide an insight into our product proposition and how we are engaging with major retailers, brands and media owners [e.g. Facebook / Twitter] -<p>http://www.mobileize.co.uk/uploads/5/3/0/0/5300468/mobileize_drive_to_purchase_overview.pdf.<p>Our technology has been running flawlessly for 1 year. We have secured 2 clients since filing our patent on 6th June 2013. [Fullers Pubs  400 locations & National Trust 600 locations]. Our platform works globally and we have significant interest from many of the worlds biggest brands including Facebook, Twitter, Coke, McDonalds, Kraft, Cadbury, Tesco, Chrysler.<p>The market problem<p>Advertising cant show consumers where they can purchase product, thus creating a barrier in the typical sales funnel or path to purchase. Our vision is to complete the path to purchase by directly linking consumers to the nearest place to purchase in advertising or communications, enabling brands and retailers to interact with consumers when they are at their most receptive.\nAlmost all of the growth in the global advertising market in the next four years will come from mobile related spend. Within the mobile category itself, location based services will be both the largest and the fastest growing, creating a Total Addressable Market of approximately 5 billion USD by 2016 (2 billion USD in 2014). Source: ZenithOptimedia / Berg Insight.<p>Our solution<p>Our mobile marketing platform allows any piece of marketing communication to show consumers where they can purchase the advertised product. This is a disruptive approach to advertising, which gives users of the Mobileize platform the following advantages: - we respond to a stated consumer need immediately when engaged within a campaign;\n-  we provide an audience at scale that has expressed an interest to purchase or interact. Scale because it works on any device and within most advertising mediums, including social media, web site, email, press, outdoor and TV (using bar codes, short codes and NFC].<p>Our Mass Publishing System also enables our clients to target marketing offers and content at consumers on a store by store basis. We provide location and media channel analytics that allows our clients to improve their marketing activity over time.<p>Our business model<p>Mobileize derives its revenue from 12 month rolling service contracts with customers. Contracts include a one off set up cost, a monthly charge per location (between 1 and 5) and a campaign management fee based on the number of interactions with a campaign. Average client revenues of 45-85k are expected to increase year-on-year as the platform develops and its usage increases. Contracts have been modelled based on a single install per customer per country.<p>Competitors<p>We have identified two key areas that create an unfair advantage over location-based competitors such as Google Places, Foursquare and NearMe. Firstly the Mobileize platform runs in the Cloud so it works on any mobile device and can connect to any communication. We are not restricted to just connecting to advertising that is delivered digitally or on mobile devices. Mobileize works equally well in outdoor or in press advertising and even works on moving buses or trains and on underground transport where Internet is available. Secondly, we have a fast mass publishing system, where individual store information and content can be changed on an hourly basis across thousands of stores.<p>The Management Team<p>Gray Sycamore, CTO  & Co-Founder  was formerly Leo Burnett Group Digital Director and developed the Mobileize technical platform over the last 2 years. Chris Nicholls, CSO & Co-Founder  was formerly Worldwide Managing Director International clients at TBWA /TEQUILA Worldwide in New York. Paul Kingsley, CFO  has held a number of senior positions within digital businesses including CEO of Oyster Partners (now LBi/Digitas) and has significant experience working with start-up organisations. Members of Advisory Board - Matt Atkinson Chief Marketing Officer Tesco PLC & Jason Kuperman Vice President - Digital, Asia Pacific, India, Middle East and Africa at Omnicom Group.<p>What we are looking for<p>Mobileize is a UK registered company (GSCN Limited t/a as Mobileize) and is seeking to secure $1.6M in order to develop the business over the next 12 months in the following specific areas: General working capital; Developing our technology roadmap; We will also develop new business opportunities in international markets initially in North America from Q2 2014.\nThe Management team are looking to achieve revenues in excess of USD 50million by Year 5, equivalent to 1% of the global addressable market.",1381405695,1452917149

moolave,249,"Moolave (moo-la-vey) does realtime remote data replication with 24/7 uptime capacity in Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Unix - all simultaneously.  Our servers also run and are compatible with most virtualization solutions such as vmware, Xen, Kvm, and Microsoft.<p>Besides flexibility, our server storage technology allows startups and enterprise to eliminate some of the annual burden costs of physical hardware such as purchase price, administrator time, SLAs, maintenance, rack space, floor space, power, cooling, etc. which altogether creates a huge impact to company operations. We optimize underutilized storage inefficiencies through flexible capacity management tools. A few things Moolave highly considers with this\ninfrastructure is security, administration, and stability while running efficiently at the same time.  Our website is www.moolave.com<p>Moolave's cost-efficient server storage does not require daily sync schedules which is a prevalent maintenance challenge among companies that rely on overnight server updates and frequent server maintenance that require downtime.  Our remote virtual storage servers replicate\ndata in realtime at an event of local server downtime and server update.  If one server shuts down due to network failure, another remote server instantly mirrors and preserves the same exact data without losing the most updated information.",1273984245,1452889278

Reinvented the internet with secure openflow (SDN/NDN) open hardware switches and routers from 1 to 80 Gbps, $150 per home, $500 for 8x10Gbps switches. See (unfinished!) websites http://morphle.org or http://siliconsqueak.org. Products for sale now, Q1 2014, including SFP+ lasers and such. Mass production in Q2 2014 will lower prices to $50 for 8x1Gbps, $200 for 8 x 10 Gbps, including 802.11ac wifi.<p>We are a Research foundation that is inviting, funding and organizing a global federation of co-operatives (and companies) of Neighborhood DIY ISP&#x27;s that can offer professional, secure and anonymous fiber to the home and farm internet at speeds of 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps up to 80 Gbps based on our switches. We invite everyone who wants to participate or start their own ISP with our help. We currently have more then 1100 km of backbone on three continents for everyone to hook up their DIY ISP at cost price. We can also set up new backbones, neutral internet exchanges and submarine cables in other area&#x27;s. We produce our own open source hardware switches and routers with fiber, copper ethernet and wifi. You can reach us at aart at knoware dot nl We will provide courses, tools and investment for anyone willing to attempt to built an ISP, provide privacy protection is your intent. I started the first public internet provider in my country, to indicate that we have some prior experience.<p>We welcome women, developers, scientist, Phd students and HN type co-founders to work with or for us to build out this system to regain anonymity and privacy while providing gigabit+ speeds.

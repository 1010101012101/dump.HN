I mean, it's not like factory workers are being snapped up right now. Or, you know, Ada programmers or something. It's really more about supply & demand (hah!).<p>I think there are different ways to approach thinking about an MBA degree. While it's true that MBA (often, but actually not always) doesn't give you hard skills (quants & opresearch guys would disagree!), it doesn't make the 'soft skills' useless. For me, the most valuable aspect of my program (granted, there are schools & there are, well, worthless schools, I'm quite biased) was learning about different aspects of business, hearing about problems other people/classmates have encountered & arguing heatedly, reflecting on my years of work & seeing additional angles & solutions, addressing practical problems with practical solutions (not all real problems can be solved with code, you know, although we can all wish :)<p>Of course, I think that the best MBAs are the ones who've actually been working on something real before they apply to the business school, and to be fair, that's what many business schools in fact encourage. Well, I can go on and on, maybe we can chat more about it when we meet. I won't convince you that MBA is a must, I don't believe that myself duh, but, just like Java, there are circumstances, independent of economy, in which it is warranted. :)<p>In fact, even if it is true that ""the economy is turning more into skill-based economy"" (let's see what it's going to be like in 10 years), it doesn't mean you don't need (granted, fewer) ""soft-skillers"". It's kind of like saying that because Internet allows disintermediation of content, you no longer need any mediators (although, of course, there are people who believe that, too).",1246049945

However, sometimes it's smarter to take losses in the short term if it encourages long-term growth and sustainabiltiy.

You don't try to drag your existing business model to the iPhone and hope that the market drastically changes.</i><p>If your existing business model is ""pay the rent"", much less ""cover payroll"", then yes, you're quite right -- you can't drag your existing business model to the iPhone.<p>We do bespoke development for iPhone customers. They lose money, we make payroll, and we wait for the market to mature. Until it does, the iPhone is a total wash, and don't be surprised when the smaller shops that can't eat the loss start dropping out. It's a gold rush.<p>$1.99 is less than the cost of a movie rental, but movies have massive leverage across an incredibly large market.

Regardless of a dead center or offset camera angle, they are both from the outfield, which makes visually inferring when the ball crosses the plate a hard problem for our eyes to handle.  Since pitches, even fastballs, have incredible amounts of movement, watching from a television means guess work at best.  Thankfully, all baseball broadcasters have all kinds of camera angles and pitch tracking to show exactly where the ball crossed, and those features are used frequently so the viewer is rarely left in the dark on questionable calls.<p>Neither is optimal and I personally thought the offset camera did a far better job indicating the pitch was outside for the fastball pitch the article focused on (though the slider movement was indeed exaggerated).

676048,comment,675909,675909,0,0,Mintz,,,"Am I the only going, ""duh?"" It was only a matter of time. I can things of a few reasons why web ads are more expensive:<p>1. People actually watch the web ads. They're only 15-30 seconds, so you don't have time to get up, use the bathroom, grab a drink, etc. It's a trivial amount of time that provides little opportunity to do anything else.<p>2. How many people watch the ads is more statistically trackable on the web. Who knows how many people are watching the Simpsons when it comes on? Someone could have just left the cable box on, someone might watch it through an antenna, a bunch of people could be watching it from the couch or one guy could be on the couch. How many people watched this show on Hulu? Well, we had 34,746 streams within the past week, and an overwhelming majority of them are probably one person at a computer.<p>3. You can decide if you like or dislike the ad. Ad companies can now be sure that they're not wasting money advertising Viagra to a teenager.<p>4. Hulu is insanely popular. It's one of the top-trafficked streaming websites last time I checked TechCrunch. People actually WANT to watch the show they're looking for, which, when joined with point #3, means the ads are even MORE tailored to the consumer. Convincing you to buy something you're already kinda interested in is way easier than selling ketchup popsicles to a woman in white gloves.<p>Summary: Web TV is finally getting the attention it has always deserved (since broadband became feasible for the majority of America, anyway).",1246047918

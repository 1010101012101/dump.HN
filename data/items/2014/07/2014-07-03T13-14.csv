There was pushback against quite so aggressively moving forward in a single revision, especially incorporating so much from academia not already proven elsewhere (the browser space is <i>very</i> conservative about breaking existing content, so if something that turned out to be a bad idea shipped, it&#x27;d be very very hard to get rid of). In the end, there was relatively significant pushback once MS reappeared from themselves, Yahoo, and a number of other contributors.<p>Moving forward, the plan was essentially to tidy up the ES3 spec with minor additions, which was originally referred to as ES3.1 but eventually standardised as ES5. ES6 is the next revision of this branch of the standard.<p>ActionScript 3, as Flash uses, is based on one of the drafts of ES4, and prior to the abandonment of Flash development, the intention was to continue to evolve the language separately to ECMAScript.",1404395945

Having a list called &#x27;extremists&#x27; and &#x27;terrorists&#x27; helps you get warrants, even if the list is merely composed of people interested in protecting their anonymity.<p>Tor will never take off on its own. There are many stigmas, and many barriers. Furthermore, in the past year to two years, pretty much every service has blacklisted all Tor exit nodes. It used to be moderately easy to sign up for Gmx (and, three years ago, even gmail) over Tor without needing a phone number. Many websites block all exit nodes from posting (though most at least allow viewing).<p>I would dislike to see this as a feature in Firefox until Tor is easier to use. In principle it makes sense and I support the idea, but in practice it would make private browsing very frustrating. I also imagine that you&#x27;d have a much more extreme supply vs. demand problem if this happened, reducing an already slow Tor to barely usable speeds.",1404395933

So having the women&#x27;s league in addition to the mixed league will help women get involved in the activity.

Sometimes those resources are physical (machines, buildings, etc), but they can also be human beings.<p>I think it is reasonable for YC to have an investment theory that is something like &#x27;productivity enhancements are making many talented human resources available more cheaply, a business that finds a way to use them could do well.&#x27;<p>But, I think the Uber example is a little unclear.  It seems likely to me that driving is going to be automated away in 10-20 years.   And, since so many adults drive (even those with other jobs), there is a massive incentive to find a way to automate that activity and make it safer.<p>I think there is a bit of a paradox - as the number of people employed in a task increases, the incentive to automate that task increases as well.  I am not too optimistic that creating large numbers of long-term sustainable jobs is easy, but I think the attempt to find uses for undervalued resources makes as much sense for humans as it does for any other resource.",1404394016

With the craptastic quality of economy class travel these days, the lack of food service on semi-long flights (I&#x27;m looking at you, Delta, on your US transcontinental flights!), the insane flight schedules (I&#x27;m looking at you, India, for whom all international flights heading west leave somewhere between midnight and 3am!), the ridiculous and time consuming airport security theater (I&#x27;m looking at you Sao Paulo immigration zone!), the &quot;everything costs extra&quot; revenue model that forces everyone to try to carry-on everything ... resulting in unnecessarily lengthy boarding processes when a slew of bags end up being valet checked anyway, any nearly every other part of flying.  Perhaps I am being too harsh and uppity, but flying commercial airlines these days -- with VERY few exceptions -- feels like riding a city bus, which is decidedly not restful.  Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.  I&#x27;ve flown to India, Brazil, Mexico, cross-country US, and everything about it sucked.  The only bright spot was Global Entry, which imho is the way immigration & customs should work for everyone (minus the rigmarole of enrolling), and Pre-Check, which is the way check-in security used to be.<p>This rant was just a long-winded way of saying I blame the airlines for a lot of my jet lag problems.  The fasting method works well but I get grumpy when my blood sugar drops too low so I generally avoid this.  Getting on the destination sleep pattern by forcing myself to stay up until  that time zone goes to bed is my usual method, and it generally only takes two days to get completely adjusted.  With a wife & little kids at home, though, I&#x27;ll sometimes make a decision not to adjust so I can minimize the unpleasantness when I return (I live in North Carolina and when I travel to California I always stay on my home timezone, going to bed by 8-9pm and waking up at 3-4am Pacific.).",1404393265

Keep freed nodes in an in-place freed list inside the array and in a stack-like structure in-place beyond the part of the array that is currently in use.  This cuts down on fragmentation in the memory allocator since you are allocating one larger contiguous chunk of memory instead of many smaller pieces, keeps your data closer together in the memory space to help with cache performance and prefetching, and allows you to switch to array indices instead of pointers.  Why array indices?  If the data uses indices for its references rather than pointers, sharing it across process memory spaces at different addresses is trivial.

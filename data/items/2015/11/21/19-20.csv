10607820,comment,10604468,10604468,0,0,fnordprefect,,,"Actually, the interesting thing is that the US is somewhat of an outlier. (I am a practising non-US lawyer, with an emphasis on tech, and I program extensively as a hobby.)<p>In the Australia, UK, and other common law jurisdictions, you generally do not need to have a law degree, but you do have to do a short course that gives you the academic basics behind law - this can be and usually is done part-time, as an evening course and usually results in the award of a diploma. (see e.g.  <a href=""http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/law-careers/becoming-a-solicitor/routes-to-qualifying/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/law-careers/becoming-a-solicito...</a> or <a href=""http://www.lpab.justice.nsw.gov.au/Pages/lpab/legalprofession_prospective_students/legalprofession_prospective_students.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lpab.justice.nsw.gov.au/Pages/lpab/legalprofessio...</a>) While a good law degree helps get jobs, some of the best lawyers I have met used this path to get admitted to practice.<p>Being able to think like a lawyer is important, but the life of the law is common sense, experience and good judgment. That cannot be taught. Newly-qualified lawyers invariably tend to be up to speed on the theoretical aspects of law but cannot run a lawsuit, manage a deal or draft a contract to save themselves. What law school teaches (the basics of the subjects and <i>thinking</i> like a lawyer) is only about 1/10 to 1/20 of the role.<p>The real meat of the role is thinking strategically and pragmatically: yes, I can oppose this request, but what is it going to prompt the other side to do, and how will judge X take it when the matter is brought in front of him. In other words, what will the client possibly gain or lose from taking that course? Is it worth it? And what other courses are open? And what are they likely to lead to? What do I need to get to win the case, and what is optional, unnecessary or a distraction? How does this fit with what the client wants and (often) what the client needs that they don&#x27;t even realise they need or (commonly) that they actively don&#x27;t want to do? Good lawyers are thinking multiple steps down the road, not just the immediate problems, and have a good idea where they want to end up.<p>You can only get this by experience, and ideally by watching and learning from people who are experienced at it while they do it. You could try to do it by self-study, but you would likely be sued into oblivion by your clients for all the mistakes you would make (which would usually be caught and avoided by the more experienced person you should be learning under, and if not absorbed by their insurance). Based on my experience, which includes international experience, I estimate that you need 10 years of doing it full-time to be at a point where you would be able to describe yourself as competent, and able to do it alone, provided you have been working and learning during that time.<p>You need to learn human nature, how people think and are motivated, how they react to incentives and disincentives, and how they react to normative or moral issues. You need to appreciate that you never find black or white but only shades of grey. You need to learn ruthless pragmatism. You need to learn persuasion. You need to learn to recognise the gulf between what a contract or statute might say in black and white, versus what a judge will do when confronted with the practical justice of the contest. That difference is magnified if a jury is involved (don&#x27;t get me started on the stupidities of the US jury system or the use of juries for anything other than criminal cases).<p>Law is much more a social science than it is anything else, but there is a big place for logic and logical thinking. Since you also need interpersonal skills, it is a hard discipline because you need to bring both &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; brain skills to bear.",1448135734

10607756,comment,10604073,10607533,0,0,purescript,,,"My answer to this has changed quite a bit over the last year. It used to be the case, at least as I saw it, that Elm had a UI focus, and PureScript tried to be a general-purpose language. So it came down to typical expressiveness vs. tooling/analysis tradeoffs. You could use Elm and maybe sacrifice some general-purpose language features like dealing with arbitrary effects, but buy yourself best-in-class tools like their excellent time-traveling debugger, and hot code reloading. Or you could pick PureScript, and have a general-purpose language which ran in a bunch of environments with lots of native libraries, but at the expense of tooling.<p>Now though, Elm has become a more general-purpose language, adding effects and various other features, and PureScript has better UI libraries and tooling/editor support. So the gap has closed somewhat.<p>Speaking generally, the goals of the two projects are pretty similar. I can&#x27;t speak for the Elm community, but &quot;bring strongly-typed FP to the JavaScript community via the web platform&quot; seems to approximate the goals of both projects pretty well (maybe someone from the Elm side can correct me here?) So the goals are similar, but the execution is very different. I think Elm and PureScript differ greatly in opinions regarding _how_ to bring strongly-typed FP to JavaScript. This is not just a question of language features (type classes and HKTs are often mentioned), but also things like how the language should present its foreign function interface to JavaScript, what the entry point to an application should look like, whether to build features into the language or in libraries, how to grow a language community, etc. In practice, these make the experience of using each language very different.<p>> when would we want one vs. the other?<p>Elm provides tools with which you can become productive quickly. Also, it&#x27;s used in production by NoRedInk and others, so it&#x27;s clear that it is general-purpose enough to be used for real applications. I think there will be two paths to PureScript for most users - from Haskell, and from JavaScript, quite possibly via Elm. Just as users might move to Elm because they want type safety and expressiveness, they might move to PureScript because they find themselves wanting even more type safety and expressiveness. Certain abstractions are possible in PureScript, but (I think, again, would be glad to be corrected..) not in Elm - free monads, monad transformers, monadic tail calls, van Laarhoven lenses, etc. SlamData is an example of an (open source) company putting these tools to great use.",1448134428

If you are shamed/shunned/fired for incompetance, then those who backed you also lose reputation.<p>In the end, nobody is going to support such a system.  We&#x27;re just about the last of the higher payed professional white/blue collar fields left.  Why, because we negotiate pay.  Going to a federated system would only serve to drive down pay, and introduce fees to an abstract organization that does very little good.

It is possible that, for all 2^128 keys, and in all 2^128 cycles there are some shuffles that AES will <i>never</i> generate (in other words, some sequences of 52 numbers that will never be generated) so you effectively have a 0% chance of hitting them.<p>From a cryptanalysis standpoint I think that&#x27;s consistent -- the probability of generating any particular single shuffle is astronomically low, so the difference between the actual probability and 0% is probably outside the realm of what&#x27;s computationally feasible.

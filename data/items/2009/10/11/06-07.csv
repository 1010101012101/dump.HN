He comes in and leaves at the same time each day (dependable).<p>Myself, I developed the intial product and the next generation product, but I would work all night, weekends, sometimes several days straight.  I wasn't coming in and leaving at the same time of the day.  In the end dependable was better then myself, he is buying two houses, going on nice vacations, while I was left out in the cold when things were temporarily difficult.  I would prefer to be in a different situation.  If I was just dependable it would be better then imaginative.  I would prefer to crank things out rather then go so hot and cold.",1255244255

People just tend to talk about sports and dating and parties and clubs and stuff.<p>Why do so many people talk about youth as some sort of idyllic time in one's life? I, for one, have found a strong trend of things getting better as I get older, not worse. Old people, in general, have more of everything, because they've had more time to accumulate it: more money, more friends, more family, more power, more skill, more social status, more life experience, more of pretty much everything (except of course for physical stamina, but this is not terribly important in today's world, as the success of numerous disabled people shows).",1255243785

Nothing is fundamentally fixed, though, so I expect the next big crisis 5 or 10 years down the road to end with the revaluation of the dollar, Zimbabwe style.<p>Gold is overhyped right now -- anyone buying gold at the moment is a fool -- and, as a rule of thumb, any commodity that people watch like a hawk (gold, silver, oil) is going to have second-order effects that aren't necessarily correlated with supply/demand and isn't a very safe bet.  That said, a lot of other less-watched commodities will be the first in line as newly-printed money trickles out into the economy and fuels an artificial manufacturing boom: copper, zinc, maybe some of the catalyst metals like palladium (too volatile for me), iron/steel to a far lesser extent (again, too volatile for me).  If I'd had the money at the time to follow my gut in 2008, I would've made a killing on copper alone -- and if I'd put some into platinum, one year ago, pre-auto-bailout, I'd have made a very comfortable one-year return (on the order of 250%).",1255243420

Suppose people thought that housing prices would grow at the rate of inflation for the next 10 years... suddenly the prospect of whether to continue making payments on the next 10 years of a 30 year mortgage looks rather stupid.  So these homeowners will be inclined to sell, driving prices down and leading to more sales, etc.<p>The above housing market deflation is precisely what the Fed wishes to avoid, so we can bet that monetary policy will be geared very specifically to prevent it, not just through interest rates, but through other actions that are done specifically to prop up housing prices.<p>In order to keep housing prices high, cheap credit will need to continue to be available to lower/middle income people...<p>We're already seeing the idea of ""credit as a right"" from policymakers... notably in the area of healthcare reform... even conservative economists have advocated things like a ""healthcare credit card"" issued by the government.  Credit card companies are being treated more like providers of public utilities than as private businesses, etc.<p>All this suggests that credit will be more democratized (and politicized) than ever... it is, I think, the extension of traditional Keynesian economics to include the ""time shifting"" aspect of credit, but with all the same goals otherwise.",1255243174

Doing a startup on the side (i.e. keeping your job for now) means you sacrifice time with your family.

It seems that I've tried to do a very long list of things, but that none of them ever actually succeed. Some of the things I've tried:<p>- Wrote a program to model the stock market. (The capital I needed evaporated during the credit crunch).<p>- Worked on a paper with a professor. (The professor bailed and they had access to lots of equipment I would have needed to finish it myself).<p>- Worked on a second paper with a second professor in another department. (Same story).<p>- Applied to Harvard, MIT and Stanford, the three big startup schools, twice, got rejected by all both times. (The school I'm going to is good academically but produces zero startups).<p>- Tried to start a company over the summer. (The other two people working with me bailed in August and are refusing to acknowledge that I own the rights to the portions of the code I wrote. Don't know what I'll do since I can't afford to sue them.)<p>- Tried to start a second company the previous summer. (Found out that that particular business had much larger capital requirements than I had thought.)<p>- Submitted my own paper to a conference, gave a talk there, but the paper was never published. (The special issue of the journal they were going to publish it in was canceled, and I haven't found another journal that would accept it.)<p>- Submitted second paper to second conference in different field. (Same story.)<p>- Applied for research internships last summer. (Rejected by all).<p>- Applied for finance internships this summer. (Rejected by all so far, not heard back from some yet, would appreciate suggestions if anyone has any).<p>- Helped to write a web application last summer. (No one uses it, and the other people working on it, who have a great deal of needed expertise, have moved onto more interesting projects).<p>- Did another webapp for one of the student clubs. (Someone else also wrote one and theirs was better, so everyone (including me) just used that instead.)<p>- Half a dozen math/science contests which I've entered. I recruited some fellow students to help practice and then we met weekly to work on our strategies. (Did badly in all of them.)<p>- Tried to start a blog, worked on it for two years.

Rackspace is also coming up with a new feature, similar to S3 called cloud files.\nBut no equivalent for SDB.<p>Since you are in development Rackspace's low end boxes (like 256M with 512 bursts, etc.)charged nominally for bandwidth will do fine. Whereas Amazon has got fixed boxes with 2G or something as far as I remember, I took it like 5 months ago.\nFor a dev box where there is no/not-much user traffic, a low end shared box from Rackspace if a good option. Its highly efficient on the budget. Once you have used it for dev phase you will have more knowledge and confidence on what Rackspace can do and what not. So you can decide whether to use it for prod or move over to something else.<p>Rackspace has got a monthly billing and anytime cancelling option. It works fine on budget as well as it gives you control over things if they are going beyond what you initially thought, as you can see the usage in real time (may be a few hours late at max). They had a money back policy too, about 4 months ago when I signed up, for the first month if the user is not satisfied.<p>About problems:<p>EC2: very less problems. But remember these are commodity hardware, measly boxes, the moment you start too many process (if doing any mutli processing) the box's response time mounts exponentially :-). Multi-threaded is fine.<p>S3 - have been using for storing images and haven't had a problem so far. You have options to save your EC2 image to your S3 space regularly to keep backup server images.\nThat costs you in terms of the space required on S3.<p>SDB: I hope you are aware but will still iterate that this is a key-value datastore, not relational. \nI will say it is very much in the works. It does a lot good at most of the times, but lack of a group-by, only text data, only lexicographic sort (which forces the user to put even numerical data in special formats to sort on it), a bit ill defined mutli-valued attributes, number of attributes allowed to put at each request and overall number of attributes for a item are a few bumps in the road.\nBut once you read the docs and be regular with the AWS forums most of these get solved.<p>Rackspace cloud server: Only problem I have faced SSH is slow sometimes.<p>Rackspace cloudfiles: haven't used. But I know that you can automate your cloud server backup to cloud files, that costs.<p>Again, as you mentioned LimeLight, that's another factor, that makes Rackspace more suitable for you.<p>So I guess you best bet is to start off with Rackspace for now and see how it goes.<p>Hope that answer helps.",1255241283

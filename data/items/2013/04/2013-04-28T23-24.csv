People start with a small amount, then add to that over the years. So each year, the principal grows via compounding and via addition of a certain amount.

For this fertilzer to not be used as an explosive it would have to contain much more iron than would ever be used by plants. Too much iron can be toxic to plants, make plants poisonous for humans to eat and cause other problems. Another issue is that most soil is not alkaline, it's acidic, especially if it has been used for agriculture. The sulfur in this ""fertilizer"" will further acidify the soil, making it more difficult for many plants to absorb nutrients through their roots (and in a vicious cycle, requiring more use of fertilizer). I'm sure the people involved had their hearts in the right place, but this development doesn't solve anything and by reducing crop yields could lead to many hungry people.",1367193074

For example, I am underweight.<p>The actual number as reported by USDA is 1%. The keyword to look for is ""very low food security"", formerly known as ""food insecurity with hunger"", which is the lowest range of food security measured by USDA.  (The second lowest range, ""low food security"", formerly ""food security without hunger"", means poor diet but no reduction in food intake.

And that can be worthwhile, and valuable, And if you want to pursue your life pursuing excellence, and practicing a skill, you can do that. That is the path of a craftsman. That is the most common path.</i><p>Default choice 2:<p><i>The only other path you hear about much is the path of the problem solver. So I see entrepreneurship and academic research as kind of two sides of that coin. There's a field, there's a set of problems in that field, or needs in the market. You go and you choose one, and you work it and make your contribution. And a little bit later on, you choose another problem, work it, make a contribution there. Again, that can be worthwhile and valuable, and if that's what you want to do, you can take that path</i><p>And finally:<p><i>Identity<p>But I don't see Larry Tesler on either of those paths. I wouldn't say he was contributing to the field of user experience design, because there was no such thing. He didn't choose some open problem to solve, he came across a problem that only existed in his own head, that no one else even recognized. And certainly, he did not define himself by his craft, he defined himself by his cause, by the principle that he fought to uphold.</i><p><i>There are many ways to live your life. That's maybe the most important thing to realize in your life, that every aspect of your life is a choice. There are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life, and accept the path that is laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to. If there's something in the world that you feel is a wrong, and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle, and you can fight for a cause. So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time, and think about what matters to you, what you believe in, and what you might fight for.</i><p>And I add: following non default choices is hard. Following a principle is hard.

That prompted me to get my own domain and move the content over (and I was able to get proper redirects installed on the company webserver).  I was happy (I had my own domain, a "".org"" and apparently, that was enough to keep the lawyers at bay).  The hosting company was happy (they didn't have to deal with the cease and desist letter) and the trademark holding company was happy (they protected their trademark like they're legally required to).  I'm sure that the trademark company would be upset if their trademark was still ""in use"" at [redacted].com (the hosting company, long gone by now).<p>2) I hosted a friend's blog on my server.  A few months later he asked me to take the blog down, for both personal and possibly legal reasons (he was afraid of litigation from his employer, who had a known history of suing employees, but that's not my story to tell).  I'm sure he would be upset (and potentially a lot poorer) had his content remained online for all to see.<p>3) I've received two requests to remove information on my blog.  The first time (<a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2001/08/22.2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2001/08/22.2</a>) someone didn't quite grasp the concept that domain name registration information is public, but I didn't feel like fighting someone who's grasp of English wasn't that great to begin with, and removed the information.  The second time (<a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2001/11/30.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2001/11/30.1</a>) was due to a mistake, so I blacked out identifying information.  I didn't want to remove the page, because, you know, cool URLs don't change (<a href=""http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html</a>); yet the incident was a mistake.

    (X) technical ( ) legislative ( ) market-based ( ) vigilante
    
    approach to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work. (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it may have other flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad federal law was passed.)
    
    ( ) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses
    ( ) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected
    ( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money
    ( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks
    (X) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it
    ( ) Users of email will not put up with it
    ( ) Microsoft will not put up with it
    ( ) The police will not put up with it
    ( ) Requires too much cooperation from spammers
    ( ) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once
    (X) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers
    ( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists
    ( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business
    
    Specifically, your plan fails to account for
    
    ( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it
    ( ) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email
    ( ) Open relays in foreign countries
    ( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses
    (X) Asshats
    ( ) Jurisdictional problems
    ( ) Unpopularity of weird new taxes
    ( ) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money
    (X) Huge existing software investment in SMTP
    ( ) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack
    ( ) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email
    ( ) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes
    (X) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches
    (X) Extreme profitability of spam
    ( ) Joe jobs and/or identity theft
    ( ) Technically illiterate politicians
    ( ) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers
    (X) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves
    ( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering
    ( ) Outlook
    
    and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
    
    (X) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever
    been shown practical
    ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
    ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
    ( ) Blacklists suck
    ( ) Whitelists suck
    ( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks
    ( ) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually
    ( ) Sending email should be free
    ( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
    ( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses
    ( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
    ( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
    ( ) I don't want the government reading my email
    ( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough
    
    Furthermore, this is what I think about you:
    
    (X) Sorry dude, but I don't think it would work.
    ( ) This is a stupid idea, and you're a stupid person for suggesting it.

Even as a youngish person (late 30's), I don't want to go in the hospital at all and if I do have to go I want to be in and out as soon as it is safe to do so.<p>The ultimate goal is to keep people as healthy as possible, and to spend the least amount of money to do so. This requires finding the right balancing point, but I'm positive it can be done if the political will exists.",1367190987

The statement assumes the whole of the management fees is being reinvested at 7%, when in reality it is being used by those who have jobs in the financial sector to pay their bills. That is quite literally like taking the price you pay for anything and multiplying it by (1.07)*50 (which is ~30) and claiming that is what they are actually charging you, since you could have otherwise invested that money at 7% and had that much in 50 years. This completely ignores the time value of money. It is equating the value of money today with the value of money fully invested for 50 years.<p>The more important lesson here is opportunity cost. If you are willing to go out and take the time to invest your money on your own, there are potentially some enormous benefits down the road, but you pay the cost in terms of time spent not working on your day job, not spending time with your kids, etc. I do a lot in rental housing, which has a fair return, but I can tell you right now, there are a lot of days I wish I just accepted whatever return I could get from someone else willing to manage my investments for me and focus on other things.",1367190895

That's obvious. Whether you can get the same return by yourself is a separate issue. Now, in the long run, your typical investor is going to get the same return (pre-fees) with active management with 2% fees as he does with an index fund at 0.1% fees, hence he's going to come out ahead using an index fund.

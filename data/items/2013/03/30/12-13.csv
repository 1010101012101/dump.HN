Yes, protecting rich Chinese citizens in South Korea is not the only concern, but it is any important one.<p>Besides that, I never said the warning would come from official diplomatic channels within the DPRK.

In one, we had a police escort to the hotel (although, to be honest, I suspect the policeman just really wanted to turn on his siren and ride in front clearing the pedestrians off the road - exciting day for him). If you don't have a mandated reason to visit another town (or even leave your own town), you aren't doing it. There will be no underground network of revolutionaries without the ability to find each other or communicate.<p>Food; food was allocated (in the towns, at least - I don't know about villages) by your official food distribution centre, which often seemed to be the ground floor of the building you were living on. You got a few days in advance at a time. If you ever decided to try something (be it make a run for the border or have a revolution), you'd have three days' worth of food to make it work. Speaking of running for the (north) border, you'd better be able to make it on foot within a few days. You'll have to stay clear of the roads (what roads there are) so it'll be yomping over fields.<p>The media is the state media. There are a number of smuggled radios etc on the country. It's very hard to get figures on this; they seem to be clustered towards the north border where they drift in from China, and in the cities. The government control of the airwaves is not absolute, but they do engage in jamming and so forth.<p>It is as people say. The country is to a large extent a prison camp. Some of it is an ""open"" prison, some of it is working three generations of a family to death, sentencing children alongside their grandparents because they upset someone with power (or had something the powerful person wanted - many Japanese of Korean origin who foolishly moved there found themselves stripped of all the wealth they brought with them and reduced to poverty or simply dispatched to a labour camp) or maybe just said the wrong thing (turning each other in does not seem to be uncommon).<p>A DPRK spring in the style of the Arab spring is not, in my opinion, on the cards.",1364646327

There are several kinds of guitar. The three most distinct types are classical guitar (nylon or gut strings), acoustic (steel strings) and electric guitars, which again can be divided into hollow and solid bodied types.<p>All these istruments are pretty different, both in physical appearance, sound and of couse also playing technique, required skills, reportoire and so on. Of course, if you are really good at one you can pick up another type more easily. However, the guitars sound and play so different that it's impossible to get good at electric guitar by only practicing classical guitar. All these types of guitars are really distinct instruments.<p>If you want to play electric rock, get a strat or tele of maybe even an LP. If you want to play electric jazz, get an electric hollowbody guitar. If you want to play folk-rock singer-songwriter or country types, get a steel stringed guitar. If you want to play classical guitar, get a classical guitar. I've seen countless of times people being handed cheap classical guitars when they want to play like Bob Dylan and Neil Young (etc) do. The result is almost always that the guitar goes in the closet after a few weeks and the interest dies down, which is pretty damn sad.<p>More expensive guitars will likely be much easier to play on and might sound better. However, I woudn't recommend spending great amounts of money on your first guitar. It is certainly possible to get great guitars for less than 1000$.",1364646237

There are a bunch of big brands that fit this, but I think the Seagulls are some of the ones that don't feel cheap while actually being affordable.<p>EDIT: for those not aware, a solid top is preferred to a plywood top for tonal quality. Most of the cheaper guitars use a plywood top.

5465183,comment,5461259,5464354,1,0,fecak,,,"I would disagree on this. This is the second comment about having no interest in salary, and that seems to be a fairly serious misconception about most recruiting.<p>I'm not sure where you are located, but in the US most recruiting is done on a contingency basis, meaning a fee is paid only if a hire is made. That fee is almost always based on a percentage of the employee's starting salary (could include bonus as well). Fees have a wide range, but during my career I have seen them everywhere between 15 and 33%.<p>The counter argument is that contingency recruiters want to close the deal, otherwise they don't get paid at all. Is the easiest way to close a deal, and to make sure the deal stays closed (see ""counteroffer""), to get the candidate his/her minimum acceptable level?  No.  You are doing both parties a disservice if you do that.<p>You are doing the candidate a disservice by only trying to achieve the minimum. You are doing the client a disservice because although they may get the hire, the deal is not as secure as it would be at a higher number (again, see counteroffer), and if your goal as a recruiter s to help clients both attract and retain (key is retain) talent, they are better off paying a bit more to make the hire happy on start and less likely to be poached by someone else.<p>If I know a candidate's minimum, achieved via some proxy ('Dave, I'll accept at 120 and start May 15', it is fulfilling to call that candidate and say 'Remember when you said I could accept at 120?  Well I got you 128.  Congrats!'  Happens all the time, and feels good every time for the candidate. On the other end, I'm coaching clients about retention and not just getting someone on board.<p>The biggest benefit to a recruiter (or any intermediary) in negotiations is a buffer. I've seen candidates do some incredibly dumb things in negotiation, such as asking for 150% of what they really are worth and expect to get, just to 'start off negotiations' - as if this were a good tactic. What happens if the recruiter isn't there as a buffer?  The candidate makes the proposal, and the company says no thanks and let's just pretend we never met.<p>Other side is a client will call and say 'your candidate was making 80 at the last job?  I'll go as high as 90, but offer 60 just do see the reaction.'  My response would be 'the reaction is going to be an annoyed candidate who now feels lots of time has been wasted. Lets not screw around, get serious about this.'<p>Without a buffer, neither of these deals happen, yet both parties were willing to accept the terms of he other.  If you think this is rare, you haven't been involved in enough deals with enough people yet.",1364645837

It was flagged for no apparent reasons while on front page top, and this impaired quite a lot its visibility. I'm not implying there were any deliberate malicious attempts, or organized obscure interests, behind flagging it, but as of today, I can't understand why it was. It would perhaps be useful to include a mandatory short motivation whenever you are flagging a post, which may be automatically delivered to authors' HN profile, so that they may be able to more easily understand the reasons behind the report.",1364644867

Economically, China has no reason to defend the DPRK and every reason to maintain trade relations with South Korea and the US.<p>And, China obviously does not want the US to have even more of a foothold, and they obviously do not want the burden of absorbing North Korea into China... Which is why I said the end-game for Chinese interference would be installation of a new puppet regime.<p>But yes, rich tourists are very very important. There is no better rallying cry for interference than affluent citizens being killed. Do you honestly think that the Chinese government would be able to brush off the hundreds, if not thousands of Chinese casualties in Korea?",1364644842

What is not obvious, although they do admit it in one line of every paper, is that is it susceptible to noise :( So it has to go in the bin even though I really want to know what my manifolds look like!",1364644841

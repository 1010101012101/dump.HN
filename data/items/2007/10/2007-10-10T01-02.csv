Just see what you can come up with.<p>",1191981593

65582,story,,,12,9,aaroneous,"Good luck to all Winter '08 Applicants! ",,"As my mouse hovered over the 'submit' button, I felt a little like I had my finger on ""the big red button."" It was very tense for a few moments. Had we conveyed our ideas the best we could? Was everything proof-read for the 30th time? Could we come off as likable AND smart in under 120 words per question? Was I really <i>that</i> fond of living off Easy Mac again? After running through the mental checklist, I took a big breath in, and gave my trackpad a solid click. (spoiler alert: the submit button changes to a resubmit button).<p>So, I wanted to wish everyone who is in shoes similar to mine the best of luck on their application, and urge you to press that button and take another positive step towards building something amazing. The mousedown is scarier than the mouseup ;]

But I suspect applications are judged just as much from what can be ascertained about the founders than the ideas themselves, so it might be a moot point. Good luck.",1191980523

65577,comment,65327,65327,0,0,Shalendra,,,"PG is an amazingly genuine guy and I think it is good to apply for those interested regardless of the result. Remember, the story of Reddit guys. Never loose an opportunity to learn from others and in this case, even by applying you will learn a lot from YC folks.

65573,comment,65563,65563,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OK, I think you're missing the point of the ""the idea doesn't matter much at this stage"" assertion by pg.<p>I'm not the keeper of pg's mind on this stuff, of course, but I'm pretty certain that pg and Co. would like to know that you are capable of having good ideas--even if it later proves to be unworkable, unmarketable, or otherwise wrong.  Having no ideas at all is probably a danger sign.<p>You have to be able to recognize problems in order to solve them...so if you can't think of a single problem in the world today that needs solving that the skill set of your team would be uniquely qualified to solve, then you're probably not quite ready to do a startup.  You clearly haven't seen enough of the real work world, if you can't think back on a hundred and one things that you or coworkers did in inefficient ways because there was no good alternative.<p>The note about the idea being fungible is just that--it's early, and you may end up changing your idea through the program, or YC might say, ""This is stupid, but you seem pretty smart, anyway...how about we sit down and come up with something else?""<p>YC wants you to be hungry _and_ smart.<p>In short: If you want into YC, I'm pretty certain you should find some kind of idea.",1191978708

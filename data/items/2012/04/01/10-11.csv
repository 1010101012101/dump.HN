3783330,comment,3783231,3783231,4,0,Joeboy,,,"> Because to me there are two perpetrators in situations like these. Those who committed the crime, obviously, but also those who make apps like Girls Around Me<p>I have no moral problem with considering the Girls Around Me devs to be at fault, but in practice it's like getting angry with individual spammers. It's futile. Pretty soon others will leap onto the publicity created by the furore and create something functionally equivalent. It seems to me the practical approaches to improving the situation are a) Embarrass Foursquare, Facebook et al into not sharing the info, b) Educate people into being more careful what they put online or c) Work on alternative social networking infrastructure that's more respectful of people's privacy. Whether or not we get upset at the Girls Around Me people is just a distraction.",1333277773

3783327,comment,3783231,3783231,4,0,diwank,,,"I think the author makes a very very important point. The entire issue needs to be viewed from the perspective that a user is <i>not</i> equal to his data. Every facebook user shares his/her information with varying intents and motivation. People maintain a fairly public facebook profile say for potential employers, old friends etc.<p>We are NOT as privacy-illiterate as we are made out to be in recent articles about <i>Girls around me</i>. For instance, I recently applied to YC and enlisted my Facebook profile. And, I have been posting a lot of public content with that very intention in mind for months now.<p>I came across another instance of this when I was trying to ""teach"" my sister the importance of heightened privacy. She plainly refused as she often needs to plan open events and she needs to put up a lot of her information public.<p>We need to understand that just as you cannot ask women not to go out for fear of stalkers, you cannot ask people not to share information publicly. In fact, we need to keep up with the shift in social media to increase law-enforcement. <i>Girls Around Me</i> is a clear violation of the intention with which millions share their information publicly.<p>I think we need to standardize and associate <i>User Intents</i> as a first class attribute to a user's data. And find and penalize miscreants like <i>Girls Around Me</i> who violate the intention associated with people's information.",1333277587

3783288,comment,3779735,3783262,1,0,philwelch,,,"Worst comes to worst you can get a perfectly serviceable car for less than $10k anyway, and arguably, if you're living paycheck to paycheck and spending more than $10k on a car, you're making a mistake by doing so.<p>But that's taking this $10k figure at face value. Gap insurance is supposed to cover the difference in value between what you still owe on the car and what the market value is if it's totaled. How do you make the numbers come out to a $10k <i>gap</i>? Odds are you're not only buying a new car (which was your first mistake) but you're buying a fairly <i>expensive</i> new car. And you're living paycheck to paycheck.<p>Sorry, it doesn't add up. The general advice is to keep six months of living expenses saved up. If you have that level of savings, plus the income that allows you to spend that much on a car, you have enough money to take the EV-maximizing route. Otherwise, you're being financially irresponsible spending that much on a car in the first place, much less on -EV addons like gap insurance.<p>In any case, what I said still holds: if you can afford to bear the variance, you're still better off maximizing your EV.<p>(Another EV-maximizing tip: whenever you're offered an extended warranty, instead of buying the warranty, take the cost of that warranty and put it in a separate savings account. If something you own breaks, use that savings to repair or replace it. They wouldn't sell the warranty unless it was profitable for them. If you sell yourself the warranty, not only will you have the money set aside for your stuff, but you'll get to keep the profits as well.)",1333275664

It's a transgression of the relationship you have with colleagues and a transgression of the normal activities that happen in an office environment. That's what makes it uncomfortable and thus funny.

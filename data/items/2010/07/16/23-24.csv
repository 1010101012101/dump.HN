1522961,comment,1520941,1522772,0,0,johngunderman,,,"Hm. I guess that's why you and I differ. I carefully trim my RSS feed so that I have, at most, 100 items a day to read. Any more than that and it feels like too much of a chore to slog through all of them. However, with only 100 items I feel like its a manageable level of content for the day. I also tend to keep my rss feeds limited to low-frequency feeds. I find it especially nice for feeds that update once a day. I then don't have to keep checking back at the  site to see if it's updated yet. Sites like Ars Technica that have high volume, I still prefer to read from the site itself. Then I can avoid the pain of having my feeds filled with hundreds of unnecessary articles.<p>However, the most important reason why I like using rss is for blogs that I stumble across that I like, but that I don't have the memory to keep all the urls in my head, or the time to spend flipping through all of them to see if they've updated. Let me give you an example: I subscribed a few months ago to a blog that was effectively dead. The author hadn't posted for about a year. Just yesterday in my blog feed, I saw that he had made a new post. I would have completely missed his post if not for the fact that I had his feed in my rss reader.<p>I completely understand your point about google stripping the formatting out of posts, and it annoys me sometimes too, but for the most part I tend to value content over nice css.<p>EDIT: I'd like to head off any comments I get about the ""memorizing urls"" comment I made. I find myself on a lot of different computers, and ""bookmarking"" a site through adding its rss feed to google reader is a lot easier for me than it is to deal with syncing bookmarks. Not to mention that my bookmarks have become an untamed jungle over time. I only venture into them when I am not looking for anything in particular. For most everything I use the autocompletion on the url bar.",1279324176

So memory management is very much tied to other resource management, since they both involve the same thing (deciding when to destroy objects you no longer need). Unfortunately not all resources can be collected equally lazily, so memory-centric GC schemes that ignore the requirements of other resources tend to get in the way (and make you do using(){...} or try/finally to make sure your files are closed, instead of allowing for RAII).",1279324075

Why does YCombinator have a high percentage of people in their 20s? People in their 20s are just more likely to be willing to try to do something like Y-Combinator.

I've achieved very rapid development (I'm the only developer), but it has come at the cost of occasionally broken parts of the site (generally for less than an hour). With < 500 users this hasn't been a problem, but I'm assuming it will be once we've launched internationally. Also 'service standards' in South Africa are far worse than the rest of the world - which means our current users are generally far more forgiving than we expect international users to be.<p>3.

Some of the sites before it are fair, but I think it is obvious that there are many that are worse than my site. For example, some are just sites where you can order a book about the moon calendar.<p>I think I did most of the ""on site"" improvements, but I don't have many inbound links, and the domain name is weird.<p>I plan to move to <a href=""http://mondkalender.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mondkalender.us</a> soon, hoping that I won't be punished too much for running a German site on a .us domain. Also finally want to launch an English language version (although I think the topic is not popular outside of Germany).<p>Also plan to improve the widget - just wondering, do iframes also count as inbound links? That was my secret master plan to generate links, to make lots of blogs include my widget. The widget really needs improving, though.<p>Once I entered the site in some catalogs. A while later I noticed the ranking had really tanked. I guess that was a big mistake. I tried to remove it, but it wasn't possible for all of them. On the other hand it seems it shouldn't be too bad, otherwise it could be used to damage the competition (enter them into catalogs, too).<p>Anyway, I plan to give the site one last push, so that I can say I have tried what I could.

1522898,comment,1522325,1522833,0,0,weeksie,,,"The point the book makes is that as we transferred from foraging to farming the entire dynamic shifted. As hunter-gatherers there was not competition for resources and it didn't matter who the genetic father of a child was. In most foraging societies today people don't care about paternity and treat all the children in the village as their own. In several Amazonian tribes they believe that children are made from an accumulation of semen in the mother and husbands often offer their wives to other people in the village.<p>The shift to farming meant that population density increased and competition for goods meant that wealth began to concentrate. With that there was a reason to ensure paternity. So yes we made a shift, but looking at our existence for the majority of the time that we've existed as a species we can see why we have always had a very tough time with monogamy.<p>Also, the idea that women have little desire to have multiple husbands is not true at all. Women are just as promiscuous as men are and when given the freedom are more than willing. Again, I highly recommend Sex at Dawn because the views that you're expressing are the exact ones that it addresses point by point.",1279322120

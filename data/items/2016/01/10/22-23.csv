The idea which is shown in a diagram in the article is that silencing GABA-releasing interneurons (which are inhibitory) with glycine consequently disinhibits dopaminergic neurons.",1452466787

Yet time spent in active use even with low mileage (say, a single one-stretch 100 km trip per week) will wear out parts and components. Changes in temperature and humidity have an effect there. I&#x27;ve also observed common replacement cycles mostly regardless to mileage for some parts: a ten-year car is likely to need similar parts replaced regardless of whether it has 100tkm or 250tkm on it.

As a polyglot with experience in plenty of languages, I&#x27;d minimize the number of syntaxes to pick up.  I would focus on leveraging your javascript background as a starting point.<p>Let me tell you why.<p>Not much has changed since the 90&#x27;s in one area: there are as many opinions and interpretations running around as facts.  There&#x27;s no shortage of time being spent re-inventing the wheel over and over in frameworks that really don&#x27;t look much different.  The end result is most languages have pretty decent frameworks to work with.<p>A better question is what would be a best path forward for you to dip your feet in and move forward?<p>The web and mobile landscape is a lot nicer now with the tools that aim to help you get things done quicker, as long as you don&#x27;t go off their beaten path.<p>Which two swiss army knife tools could you use to roll out into one thing?<p>The first big shift is to think mobile first, including mobile web based apps that also work on desktop.<p>I&#x27;ve jumped into Javascript more so in the past year as node.js has continued to mature.  I use my strategically limited time to build value and not spend my time learning like I had to in my 20&#x27;s.<p>The frameworks I&#x27;m playing with at the moment that provided a good coverage for web applications as well as doing mobile web app dev, as well as mobile app development.<p>Sails.js (forked to trails.js now) will be familiar to you.  This will cover writing web apps and not having to build your own entire stack.  Has worked wonderfully for the few projects I&#x27;ve used it for.<p>To cover mobile development, I recommend looking at ionic framework to start out with.  It can connect just fine to a backend like parse.com.<p>There are no shortage of business and information driven apps (that pay well) that this technology can create with one code base for all end points.  There is a great case to build native apps once something like this solves a problem.<p>If you want to get into mobile development from a higher level to explore, I really recommend a tool like appery.io.  It was dicey before in places but now has ionic built in, it&#x27;s a fantastic prototyping tool for JS apps.<p>Beyond this, I&#x27;ve always had a crush on Python and want to spend more time with it, but for now Javascript keeps me moving along.<p>Feel free to reach out if you wanna chat, you sound like you have a lot of experience already.",1452465690

I keep reading these articles that give glowing reports about how it fixes things for women or whatever, and I am incredibly skeptical of that fact. Historically, when you infuse a system with more cash without that cash being connected to increased productivity, the result is inflation. In fact, that is basically the definition of inflation: Needing more money to pay for the same goods and services.<p>I realize that people are arguing that machines and the like are producing labor, thereby infusing the system with productivity, and the problem we have is redistributing the wealth it produces. But I am very skeptical that a UBI is a good solution to that problem.<p>I have a lot of half formed thoughts in reaction to reading this piece. I don&#x27;t know how to begin to back up my opinions when they are based on decades of reading books and articles that, in many cases, I no longer recall the titles of. It is not like I kept a written list of everything I ever read. I was reading these things for personal reasons. But I really am not comfortable with some of the premises of the arguments being made, such as &quot;Basic income helps undermine sexism.&quot; I see no reason to believe that. They did away with slavery in the American South and, from what I have read, blacks had it worse in the years after slavery was abolished. They couldn&#x27;t get jobs, laws were written to deny them the right to vote, etc. We are still, to this day, trying to redress the matter. Blacks in America still, overall, make less money, get arrested more, etc.<p>I have also known women who had jobs who struck me as more enslaved than I felt as a homemaker. Their jobs did not significantly relieve them of the &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot; at home, so their jobs were often more relief for their husband, who no longer felt 100% responsible for paying the bills, yet did not see any real reason to buck up and do housework.<p>I have seen many stories over the years where people thought that giving money would right some social ill, only to see it not work. Money seems to never be able to really fix social ills. Those battles are fought in the hearts and minds of the people, in the establishment of new cultural norms, and in the courts where we determine rights.<p>Everything I have ever seen suggests to me that financial security or wealth grow out of rights/privilege, not the other way around.",1452465412

If you are like me, you use ad-blockers and ghostery with much reason.<p>But the main problem is that the current model has been and still is extremely profitable. Ad-tech helps business grow their revenues. Click-baits, user tracking, pop ups, targeted ads... all these things exist because they make incredible amounts of money for many involved parts (publishers, ad-platforms, audience analyzers...), and because the majority of internet users are not like you and me, and they do respond to ads, click on them (or are tricked to do so) and don&#x27;t give a shit that they are being profiled for profit.<p>I think, as users are more aware and ad-blockers become the default (which is awesome), we will move into a model where you either accept the ads (possibly better integrated), or pay, or find it more difficult to visit some sites (there will always be ways to circumvent). Ad-industry will never be truly on the side of the random internet users, as they are not the ones paying the ad-tech companies (publishers do). In any case, the ad-industry will continue on its own ways, perhaps less intrusively (most of what makes ad-tech you don&#x27;t even see it, the ads are just the tip of the money making iceberg).

They key IMO is concurrency and migrating blocking operations to other dedicated threads, and this is where an efficient coroutines implementation would help both with accomplishing that task, but, perhaps more importantly, keeping the programming model simple.<p>C++17 will introduce support for reusmable functions ( <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/11/12/resumable-functions-in-c.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/11/12/resumable-...</a> ). This will be a game changer. Now, you can approximate this by e.g creating task abstractions and use lower-level(but slow) setjmp/longjmp functions, or just design tasks/functors that hold state that can schedule other tasks in turn, and so on. It works, but the overhead, mental, but also n terms of processing/executing/scheduling can be too great.",1452463897

We figured we&#x27;d cold email some PH influencers - we had nothing to lose. Just a two sentence summary: who we were, what our product did. To our surprise, several influencers actually replied positively and offered to feature us. Alex Carter (@AlexCartaz) who heads up the Product Hunt podcast did the honors - for that we are extremely indebted. Some PH users prefer that you not contact, but many don&#x27;t mind if you keep it short and unique.<p>Leading up to the day of the feature, I started compiling our friends and colleagues into a contact list, as well as our beta users, and influencers who were enthusiastic. I drafted different emails to each of them. We never asked anybody for a vote but we&#x27;d say something like &quot;if you believe in the mission, please help us share and get the word out.&quot;<p>The morning of the feature (today), I took a strategic approach to sleep. Being on the west coast, I went to bed at 9pm the night before, got up at midnight, and as soon as we were featured, emailed all of the contacts I mentioned above. I went back to sleep at 2am, and then woke up again around 6am. We did some cross posting but those were not really that impactful. I think the biggest impact were our circle of friends and colleagues, the influencers, and of course the product itself which is kind of controversial.<p>Throughout the day, it&#x27;s been an exercise in responding to emails, comments across all the channels, and following every one of the people who supported us and saying thank you to them. I love what PH is about - giving products a chance to stick. I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions, if you have any, or provide tips. Thanks!",1452463784

Can be city-scale depending on the nature of the conflict. They have great power, and in some ways the very same kind of power as a government.

Look them up on any MBA syllabus.<p>Here are some notes based on a book outline I have for a manual on negotiations for STEM grads (that I will probably never write):<p>First, remember that you are the seller, and it&#x27;s up to you whether you want to sell to them. You aren&#x27;t applying for an honor or academic award, or begging for mercy and approval, you are selling valuable skills. Sometimes you are a price maker, sometimes you are a price taker. Know which one you are before choosing your strategy.<p>Second, always appeal to principle. Real negotiation is a rational process of legitimate price discovery between parties. There is a true price, a kind of superposition, that is acceptable to all parties, and the work is to infer its position. You are engaging in a partnership to discover together if there is a viable deal. Understand the detailed differences between haggling, bullying/ultimatums, and negotiation. A negotiation is a conversation in which you derive principles to agree upon, and those principles shape the outcome (final numbers).<p>Third, always reiterate your commitment to flexibility and and appeal to their reciprocity of this principle.  If they decline both reciprocity and flexibility, especially without a specific number, it&#x27;s likely there isn&#x27;t a real deal on the table.<p>Fourth, add variables (new principles) to soften positions. If they start haggling numbers at you, you can always ask what the principle behind a number is. (what&#x27;s that number based on? Is it data I can see? What data did you disqualify? Here&#x27;s one of the data sources I am using..).<p>Fifth, state you are evaluating &quot;total package value.&quot; If they propose a number, you can ask about bonuses, equity, options, commissions, memberships, travel rewards, lifestyle perks, housing allowances, medical, vehicles, benefits, retirement matching, concierge services, wellness, &quot;no red M&M&#x27;s&quot; etc. Anything they say no to, you can say you will evaluate any offer based on pricing in the value of these other things, whether they are in benefits or cash.<p>Sixth, know wtf you are talking about. If you don&#x27;t know what the position pays in that city because you don&#x27;t know how glassdoor works, and you don&#x27;t know how much it would cost (gross) to pay a consultant to do the work instead of you, you are flying blind.<p>Seventh, never, ever, give anyone your current compensation. That&#x27;s between you and your tax authority. Like many bits of information, it can only ever be used to disadvantage you. They will be extra persistent and act shocked and insulted because some of them are so used to STEM&#x27;s just rolling over on the question. That&#x27;s a tactic. Always appeal to principle, in this case, the principle of your employers competitive information.  They might walk away, but only because they want a sucker and determined you weren&#x27;t one.<p>Eighth, answer recruiters calls and emails and do interviews even if you aren&#x27;t interested. You need the practice, and you may be surprised at how good a given opportunity turns out to be. Recruiters and HR people are in the business of selling jobs to talent. You are not wasting their time. If they can&#x27;t close you on selling you a job, they are only wasting their own time.<p>Ninth, there are only about 4 reasons a principled negotiation fails: 1) one side is not committed to flexibility and reciprocity; 2) there just wasn&#x27;t a viable deal between those parties on those terms in the first place; 3) one party was bluffing or exaggerating about their ability to deliver on their part of the bargain; 4) parties lack the emotional maturity to have principled discussions about abstract concepts and hypotheticals.<p>Tenth, if there were the possibility of an advance, I would be willing to have the conversation about what a deal would look like.<p>;)",1452463509

Let go of your frustration for now, a company is an incredibly complex machine and you need to invest more than 6 months learning how it works before people take your criticism seriously (I know this can be hard). Also, some people like to &#x27;grill&#x27; the newbie as a right of passage, you may be experiencing this.<p>2. Acknowledge that code-reuse is awesome. It&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s reusable functionality, part of your job is memorizing the handy tools at a company and if they&#x27;re good enough, rebuilding those tools later at your next job.<p>3. It sounds like you&#x27;re frustrated that you don&#x27;t find out about existing libraries/functions/classes/tools until your code review. That seems like a reasonable concern. Maybe next time you have a project come up with a rough plan and ask a senior developer for architecture-level feedback before you start coding.<p>4. Don&#x27;t feel bad. You don&#x27;t need to be a hero or change the world. If you mimic the senior engineers and try to fit in that&#x27;ll go further than studying engineering theory, writing perfect code, or documenting the codebase. Once you&#x27;re accepted into the group they&#x27;ll be much more receptive to your ideas on how fix things.",1452463404

If you have a smartphone but the list of benefits from the Newton appeal to you, you might want to try a Livescribe+ smartpen. Syncs with your phone or tablet, works like a pen on notepad or paper, the sync app takes care of handwriting recognition, and you can sync through it to Dropbox or Evernote. So you can leave your phone in your pocket and just use a pen and a notepad, and still have the benefits of everything being transcribed automagically and available online. (Yes, it needs special paper, but the dot pattern is available as a PDF if you want to print your own.)",1452463395

But a movie also has to be known. Ad spend gets the movie in front of eye-balls at least insofar as it gets to be known to exist. But also word-of-mouth, which is like free ad spend. This is why there are slow burners and mega-flops.<p>Incidentally this is why I have refused to see Titanic, Avatar, and the latest Star Wars in the theatre. If you scream in my face I&#x27;m not going to watch your movie in the theatre. Hype turns me off seeing something, but that&#x27;s just me not wanting to roll with the crowd perhaps, and not a function of hype itself.

The author writes about his own experience going from Illinois to Indiana and then Texas.  My uncle was a surgeon in Texas pre and post tort reform and I saw first hand how much of a difference it made.  It&#x27;s anecdotal of course, but his malpractice dropped from $150k to $50k solely as a result of that law.  He reaped the gains for a couple years and then reimbursements were lowered to compensate.  Those lower reimbursements are used to calculate premium costs which then also benefited from the reduced med mal costs.  The emergency physician correctly points out that med mal functions largely as a transfer of wealth from people with health insurance (which is now, in theory, everyone) to trial attorneys.  Lastly I&#x27;d point out, again from my uncle&#x27;s experience, that being sued is an extremely stressful experience even if the eventual financial outcome isn&#x27;t very impactful.  I couldn&#x27;t relate to it until I went through the same experience myself.",1452463304

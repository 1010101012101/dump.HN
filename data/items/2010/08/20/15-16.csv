1620727,story,,,1,1,RossM,"Storing semi-confidential data",,"I'm developing a diary/journal web-app - there are many things that make this better over using a diary but the obvious disadvantage is that you can hide your diary under the bed and be pretty sure noone is reading it. While I can say in a privacy policy I'm not going to read any entries you make that's still up to the user to trust me on that. So what I'm looking for is a method to encrypt (and decrypt) the text entries made by the user.<p>I'm really not very knowledgeable on encryption so I'm looking for some advice on how to do this. My main idea at the moment is to have a key that is never stored and is entered each time they login and used throughout the session to encrypt and decrypt each text entry. Again the user can't necessarily know the key is not being stored but as far as the implementation goes this seems ok. This also has the added benefit of users being able to store entries under different keys so that there isn't a single key to unlock them all.<p>Is there a better/more common way of doing this?",1282319879

1620722,comment,1618196,1618956,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I had a girlfriend at the time who was an avid objectivist, and I read the book looking specifically at the philosophy. I replied to you in good faith because you claimed that you'd never seen a decent argument by someone who'd read the book. I not only read the book but listened to hours of detailed explanation of objectivist philosophy -- if I've conflated anything, it's the general beliefs of objectivism with the specific plot and details of Atlas Shrugged.<p>Also, to say that Rand didn't ""blame"" those doing the exploiting is simply wrong: She portrayed those doing the exploiting as evil and without morals (which to her is synonymous). Maybe you can't ""blame"" a person who is acting out of their nature, but that's a semantic argument. She also said that the smart/hard working people had a choice, and so equally blamed them for going along with being exploited--and that much of her message I agree with, in that I quit my job to start my own company.<p>But if you're going to accuse me of lying straight out, then there's no real point in arguing. Your responses also didn't address what I actually said--I gave specific examples as to how the market has failed, and blamed the LACK of action of the government on corporate influence. WHY the market fails is far more complicated than can be discussed in a single blog comment--THAT it fails should be sufficient to make my point. The disasters I listed are all caused by too much reliance on libertarian/objectivist principles of absolute laissez faire capitalism. A government that properly protected its citizens and the environment wouldn't have allowed any of the above to happen.<p>If the reason for that is that you can't see ANY argument as decent, regardless of merit, then there's no point in engaging.<p>I had an argument with someone a while back that felt like this--I'd give a dozen rational statements that supported my side, and the response was always an attack on a tangential point in one or two. I'd try to dig deeper, and again the argument would derail in a bizarre manner. I think that in situations like this it means that the person responding that way SO MUCH wants to believe his or her side that any challenge is met with an overkill response of rationalization. I think this is where the term ""Fractally Wrong"" comes from.<p>From time to time I feel myself reacting that way to a question. I treat it as a warning: There's something that I WANT to believe, that I take as a matter of faith, that I don't really think is true, so my rationalization engine gets kicked into overdrive, and I get angry and the person challenging my assumptions to boot.<p>I am NOT accusing you of this to attempt to hurt your position. Your responses were not nearly of the magnitude of that past debate opponent. But if things that I -- or anyone else -- is saying cause an extreme emotional response (say, to accuse them of lying rather than just addressing their points), and you feel the need to write out pages of reasons why the other person is wrong without actually dealing with their points directly, then I urge you to perform a bit of self evaluation. See if you might not actually believe your position as rationally as you think you do.<p>Because when you reply in anger, it makes me feel that I'm attacking a matter of faith rather than a carefully considered position. And when I reply in anger, it says, to me, the same thing about me.<p>I may be a bit obsessive about writing long answers, but I'm not feeling angry right now.<p>/tangent",1282319812

It can be hard on your family, especially your wife, to ""not be allowed"" to interrupt you. You have to remember that your family interrupts you because they care about you and they want you involved in their lives, but at the same time you have to find a way to tactfully get them to stay away from your office during your workday.<p>Sitting almost perfectly still in front of a computer and concentrating for hours and hours at a stretch is not a natural act. Humans are wired to get involved with the social activities going on around them. Depending on the difficulty of what you are working on, a few family interruptions per day or a too-high noise level from elsewhere in the house can destroy the quality of your work for the entire day.<p>Interruptions are also a big problem in a traditional office environment, but there you have much less invested in your efficiency. If management isn't willing to pay for private offices where the staff can concentrate properly -- then they get what they pay for and its not really the programmer's job to question it. At least everybody in a shared office area is in the same boat and everybody suffers from the same distractions.<p>In a startup, however, interruptions can ruin you and must be dealt with.",1282319327

However, from reading Kurzweil's article get that this point is irrelevant, because he never suggested to reverse engineer the brain in that way. He used the genome argument as an estimate on how complex the brain is, basically viewing the genome as a data compression of the brain.<p>Myers argument only shows that the decompression algorithm, i.e. the route from the genome to brain, is insanely complex, but it doesn't say anything about the actual complexity of the brain. \nSo in essence, yes, if we would choose to model the brain in a highly compressed form like the human genome we would potentially need a computer that could model it's own subatomic physics, but that's not likely the way we would want to approach this.<p>Anyways, this doesn't mean that the brain isn't very complex and impossible for us to model at the moment.

(edit: and because I almost always found a way 'Fred' became convinced that that was just me trying to get out from under work that I could do but didn't want to do, so every time I managed to fix something[1] I proved him right in a way deepening the misery and the complexity of the next challenge).<p>Another option would have been to take time out to study the underlying theory better. The initial spec was trivial, if there had been any indication of how immense the requirements were going to be I would have either refused the work or I would have taken out a year or more to educate myself on the subject matter.<p>Funny thing though, even now, knowing as much as I do I would probably refuse that job. This is not a one person thing, there are too many specialties involved and the codebase is far too large for a single person. The demands placed on such software have only gone up over the years.<p>One thing is funny though, even today in terms of ease of use the UI I came up with <i>still</i> is better than anything else on the market, as is the toolpath optimizer that is built in.<p>Eventually, during the creation of a parallel development (the milling software, which I've left out of the story, it would not have added too much I though, but now I realize it would have added one more thing), I got so stuck on a piece of very hard math that I managed to convince Fred that we needed outside expertise and by great exception I was allowed to spend some money on a consult with a real mathematician.<p>Another thing where we brought in an outsider was when the display requirements went up way beyond the initial spec (real time zoom during the runs), I was allowed to hire a friend of mine (Maurice), a guy that I'd worked together with on programming games to write a chunk of assembly given a datastructure. This was doable because it was a fairly isolated part of the code, but Fred was totally paranoid about bringing on board other programmers having access to large chunks of the source.<p>[1] A nice example of such a situation was when we had to do the thread cutting that was so easily discarded in the beginning after all. This required a synchronization with a third axis spinning at anything between 50 and 1500 RPM or so, yielding a pulse train of up to 25Khz, something that none of the interrupt inputs of the chosen computer could handle with any reliability, especially not while driving a stepper at the same time with very tight constraints on latency. Normally encoder output is fed in to specialized counter boards but those were way out of the budget, and besides would only fit the IBM architecture. So I designed our own counterboard, and fed the output in to the midi port with a bunch of trickery to be able to re-construct the position of the toolbit relative to the index on the main axis.<p>This was a very nasty bit of code, because it depended on a lot of things that could change in real time (such as the density of the material being hit, the supply of coolant and so on) and there was not a whole lot of margin for error here. Once a thread has been 'started' you can't back out, you have to complete the sweep. So what the program would do is look in a table to figure out how much lag we could reasonably expect after hitting the material with the toolbit, then measure the sitation as it actually occured and compensate. Eventually I got it to work reliably enough for production but of course that was a total hack.",1282318411

You may not know what that is, at the outset of an encounter / getting to know someone, but by remaining inoffensive and observant, you have a better chance of finding out.  For example, there are some people who can barely add three digit numbers, but who are brilliant -- somehow or other -- at that overused term ""social networking"".  I guess this example is a bit stereo-typical; nonetheless, it exists.  There are others.<p>Don't spend excessive time on those who really don't interest you.  However, contrary perhaps to initial expectations, being overtly offensive is not necessarily conducive to this.  You piss them off, and if this is e.g. at work, you have to spend more and more time dealing with the fallout.  Other people you do need or even want to interact with become more reserved or distant or require smoothing over because your interactions put them on edge or on guard.<p>Maybe a martial arts metaphor.  If you fight stupidity directly with your own energy, you get stuck and expend a lot in direct effort.  If you turn a bit and let it slide on by, you are free to move on to better things, at the same time leaving the other party unaware of what has just happened.<p>Finally, make sure your own house is (really) in order.  In general, the better one feels about oneself, the less inclination to be defensive (""fuck you"" is a defensive statement).  And a tip:  Don't conflate having X with feeling good about oneself.  It's more about doing than having.<p>(I'll add that people learn better by example than through words.  Meaning that verbal responses aren't that useful in addressing problems -- say, ignorance -- anyway.  Doing things the right way shows a better way to those capable of getting a clue.  As for those who can't get it, make sure your business doesn't depend on them.<p>And when your business is suffering, keep in mind that others are applying the same to you.

It put a major strain on our relationship - she worked outside the home, I worked primarily at home, and she didn't get the concept of ""physically at home but working and unavailable."" We are no longer together, in part because of this.<p>Your SO may be incompatible with your startup - it's far better to discover things like this before getting married. You may choose the SO over the startup, but you should be aware you are making that choice.<p>Worst case scenario: an ex-wife who acted as a burden throughout the startup process walks away with 50% of your successful company.<p>(Note: a prenup won't help much - courts are in the habit of nullifying them if the judge doesn't like them.

I left a very good, high paying, stable job to work with startups.  The first key thing is getting your wife on board.  There is a lot more risk and stress with startups.    Make sure both of you understand this issue.  Money is already a big stress on marriages and you are about to make that situation worse in the short term.  The other big issue (at least in the states) is health insurance.  It costs a lot more that I would like.<p>The startup I work at is a great fit. We are boot strapped and profitable. We are not trying to be the next google/twitter/facebook, so slow growth fits our lifestyle fine.  There have been lean times over the last year which adds financial stress, but I have fall back plan of getting a real job at any time which provides a nice safety net.  It pays to have a good network to leverage when you need it.  I work from home, so that allows me to work mostly normal hours and still get to see my wife and kids a lot.  I carve out a few evenings to put in extra hours.  I also carve out date nights with my wife.<p>So I don't see any issue with being a startup and being married.

To grow software without growing the frequency, severity, and difficulty of bugs and without growing costs associated with new features is the desired result. Component-ized architecture takes great steps to achieve this result. For this reason, I view OOP as being some combination of: message passing, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

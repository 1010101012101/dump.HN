Maybe the priest should resign and become the PR person for the hacking community?  ;p<p>I can understand the point made by the priest, but I wonder if he'd say the same about anarchists? Since just about all governments these days are corrupt and unsympathetic towards the plight of their constituency, then you would think the priest would also congratulate those who are philosophically and actively opposed to these un-Godly governments? Except...<p>All is fine and ""Godly"" until hackers or anarchists engage in destructive behavior, which is not in line with the teachings of Jesus. This Robin Hood idea of stealing from the rich, or even destroying property because it's owned by ""evil"", is wrong because both are forms of violence, which Jesus was against for obvious reasons - both acts violate individuals. Whether or not these individuals deserved it or are ""evil"" is inconsequential: two wrongs don't make a right. So I'm kind of disappointed that this disclaimer wasn't brought up by the priest, if at least towards the end of his comment. There exist more positive ways to combat negative forms of competition or scarcity issues created by ownership of property; violation of individuals doesn't need to be the answer. Although seeing the sketchy and hypocritical history of Catholics, I shouldn't be too disappointed by the omission...",1302213417

Maybe this is just naturally the way that the art is going to be funded in the future.<p>Really, all television is developed exclusively at the network level. NBC, CBS, and HBO all fund the creation of TV that they then broadcast exclusively at a specified time. They go out through the cable wires to their subscribers who either pay by watching ads (NBC), or by paying for access (HBO) (or both, right? (basic cable?)). Then after a while, it comes out on DVD, and can be syndicated by other channels.<p>In that light, these new digital distributors really are changing things up. The idea that the show would be watchable somewhere besides the cable channel at the specific time and date is quite novel. So, the networks now make shows available on their own websites, on Hulu, on iTunes, eventually on Netflix.<p>I guess I just saw the digital distributors as competitors to cable as a whole instead of new 'networks'. There is some truth to my original impression: many different networks, creators of video, distribute their wares on these sites. You see shows from NBC, Fox, etc. all sharing space on Hulu. My guess is that those relationships are going to be strained by having these distributors also pushing their own video.<p>My worry is that now these distributors are becoming networks too, and that that is going to cause problems that didn't exist in the past.

E.g., in the FLTK source code, most objects inside a short loop are called ""o"", e.g., things like<p><pre><code>   for (Widget o = window->first(); o; o = o->next()) {\n     o->activate();\n     o->show();\n   }\n</code></pre>\nI think that is extremely readable, 'o' in my mind stands for object in the same way that 'i' stands for index.

While in an unfamiliar area (I had to go to the courthouse to get a certified copy of a marriage record, and they don't take Visa or debit).  I know that banks, post offices and grocery stores offer them, but should I really have to do separate searches for banks, post offices, and grocery stores and then find the closest result on my own?

I forgot mine while travelling recently, and I didn't have time to have one shipped from Hong Kong like I normally would.

They apparently have a small section with electronics, and they had an OEM charger for $4.<p>Where is the nearest notary public that is open now?  Searching for ""notary public"" gives you lots of results for notaries, but if you need one that you can go to right now, especially if it is in the off hours, you'd be surprised at some of the places that offer this service.  The problem is that they are not easy to find using a standard search.  For example, within 1 mile from my house, there is a locksmith, a mailbox rental place, an internet cafe, and an Indian grocery store that offer notary services.  The problem is that when I search for ""notary service"" and my city name, zip code, or GPS location, all of the results are for farther away places that are dedicated notaries.  More relevant, perhaps, but not the closest.<p>I think the way you'd approach gathering a data set is to add an extra layer on top of existing data sets.

I start off fresh, become very creative, critical and able to function at my optimum and then my interest starts to decline. Whenever I would find myself crashing I'd follow my natural instincts and take a break. I'd chat with coworkers or surf the net for something that interested me until I found my interest in these leisure activities start to decline. Then I'd come back to work, refreshed and re-interested. Needless to say that in my department I held the highest amount of workload, I was the most productive and I had by far the best attitude, which was the most important thing of all since those with a bad attitude dragged down everyone else around then, decreasing others' productivity potential, thereby creating compounded productivity problems.<p>I think this kind of attention-span or mental focus cycle is normal and healthy. It's like our mental microchips over-heat if we dwell on a certain thought train too long. I only wish someone with so-called credentials would ""discover"" this and bring it to the attention of the human resources corporate-culture gate keepers.<p>I understand productivity is key in capitalism, but if we're going to make productivity the most important thing, while putting our own human needs aside, then we might as well live in a communist economic system. Whether it's about the ""masses"" or the ""economy"" it still all boils down to the same thing: the entity who holds onto the net benefit winds up being the afore mentioned curtains ""the masses"" or ""the economy"", not human beings. This inability to enjoy the net benefit is supposedly the reason why we oppose communism as an economic system. And no, stuff is not a net benefit; stuff becomes burdensome due to maintenance needs, gets old and thrown out, and only provides momentary satisfaction anyway. People should ask themselves why China has proven to be the most successful economic power since the birth of capitalism (discounting euro nations & US since they grew only because they siphoned other nation's resources). It's because China fused together two effective resource-allocation systems that are mirror images, complimentary and thus an explosively productive combination: communism and capitalism.",1302210104

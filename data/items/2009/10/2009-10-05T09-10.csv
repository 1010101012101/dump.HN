Hell, 99% of the traffic on the internet that isn't spam, piracy or porn is chitchat over opinions. Some people are even qualified to have an informed opinion. These can be aggregated.<p>- Investigative journalism costs, but it also sells (as books and magazines if not as newspapers)<p>- 99% of what ordinary reporters do every day is produce filler crap because you can't just print a blank paper with the headline ""nothing happened"". This is pumped out as news but it isn't news. It could vanish and it wouldn't be missed.",1254736720
861499,comment,860119,860119,0,0,Mz,,,"Re the Warren Buffets and such of the world.  I think if you find something you love doing and can arrange to do it largely on your own terms, spending a lot of hours at it isn't going to lead to burn out.  This is where I have issues with the mantra of ""work harder"".  It implies that your job is about sweating and suffering.  Those folks who have found their calling and love what they are doing may be putting in very long hours, but it isn't remotely the same experience that your typical worker has of their job.  They also typically built themselves a custom niche.  Warren Buffet used to work from home and arranged his work life such that he didn't have to do any of the things he didn't want to do.  He found that, legally, as long as he kept the number of investors below X (I think 100), then he didn't have the reporting requirements, registering requirements, etc that most funds have -- ie he had the freedom to do whatever he wanted without answering to anyone else.  So that's what he did (kept it below X number).  I don't know what he is doing these days, but I seriously doubt he has some supervisor standing over him and cracking the whip.<p>You see the same thing with a lot of very successful people:  They act like ""rock stars"" long before they ""make it"" and are infamous for indulging their personal peccadilloes.  If I can work on my own terms, in my own home, at my own pace, on things I want to work on and love doing, you betcha I can put in much longer hours than if I am a wage slave.",1254736703

861496,comment,861317,861317,0,0,onoj,,,"For the size you are proposing, anything other than a few resistors is out of the question. Depending on the concept though, I have seen prototypes made on watch PCBs if they can work using an existing electronic design.
The trade-off is as follows - a factory/development house can make the prototype for you IF you order the final product through them in sufficient quantities. If not - custom IC/PCB design plus casing for 100 units will cost around 50 000 USD (again - this really depends on complexity and function) And that is the china price. I live there. I do this for a living. Best place to feel your way is the Hong Kong Trade Development Council or the Productivity council. I mention these so that you can get some perspective. <a href=""http://www.hkpc.org/html/eng/common/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hkpc.org/html/eng/common/index.jsp</a>",1254736559

For starters, JSONP is as close as you can get to be a standard for cross-browser scripting.  Additionally, it seems somewhat clumsy and there has got to be some limitation on the information the data URI scheme can communicate.  I have always admired the other though because I think this is an extremely clever hack.",1254735414

If Facebook was down for a week, there'd be people searching confusedly for the next social platform That Everyone Uses.<p>Would Plus receive more traffic? Well, yeah. But so would Twitter and other social networks. My mom, for one, would return to sending email jokes instead of resharing Facebook stuff. She doesn't know what Google Plus is. I imagine a large number of other individuals are in the same boat.<p>Would people return to Facebook after a week? Assuming the connections between users aren't broken, I imagine so. It'd take more than a week to reconnect to that coworker from seven years ago, but who I still enjoy talking politics with about once a month.<p>So, in other words: Facebook's biggest asset is that it has a crapton of momentum. Keeps its one billion users on the site more and more is going to keep that momentum up. Switching from Facebook to the new thing would be more of a collective hassle than the demise of MySpace.

Flooding your body with excess glutamate throws off the brain's delicate balance of this neurotransmitter and leads to excitotoxicity (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity</a>).<p>The blood-brain barrier protects you from some of it, but the blood-brain barrier is not fully formed in babies, and this is why MSG not allowed in baby food.

This is how my first experience with airbnb is also going to be my last.<p>I recently rented out my apartment for a 2 week stay.  With my nearly $3,000 payment being held by airbnb, I received an email asking me to ""send in a scanned copy of your government issued ID and a copy of a utility bill"".  No form to do so, just the vague ""send"".  I'm not really comfortable sending as much personal info as my drivers license contains (height, weight, eye color, DL number, photo) especially over unencrypted email, and when this requirement wasn't mentioned before listing my space.<p>Here is where they lose me as a customer though- I snapped a photo of a utility bill and responded to their email.  Two days go by, my payment is still 'pending' now several days after the guest has arrived.  I send a second email inquiring if the photo was ok (I don't have a scanner handy) and why they still haven't paid me, and get no response.  More days go by with airbnb holding my payment, and I try to use their live chat.  Live chat fails silently in firefox (clicking the button does nothing).  I try in chrome and it tells me everyone is busy.  Try again later and it opens a window... then 30 seconds later tells me everyone is busy and to email my request.<p>Finally, now 9 days after my guest arrived, I receive another email from airbnb which ignores all my previous messages and tells me to once again ""send"" them scans of gov't id and utility bill.  Apparently my only option to get them to release my funds is to send highly personal information over unencrypted email, a requirement which was never made clear when I made my listing.<p>Airbnb seems like a great idea with an ideal set of founders and backers, but unexpected requirements and terrible customer support have turned me off their site.",1349460390

4617944,comment,4616704,4617790,1,0,shimon,,,"Why is this an invalid approach? If you have an agreed-upon OS installation, you've got at least several hundred megabytes of binary data from which you can extract sequences for a lookup dictionary. To compress, you locate largest substrings of the input that also appear somewhere in the OS data. For example, you might find that bytes 1000-2000 of the input data are the same as bytes 4528-5528 of /bin/ls. Then you just need a program that can extract this byte range from /bin/ls and fill it in at the appropriate place.<p>Of course, it isn't a given that you will be able to find a sufficiently large overlapping substring in the OS binary data. And it may not be allowed to assume an agreed-upon OS installation, although it was OK to assume that gunzip was available. And finally, doing this sort of largest-overlapping-substring search could be very very slow.<p>The real key here is that the challenge is about compressing one specific random file. It's clearly impossible to write a compressor that can represent ANY sequence of N bytes in fewer than N bytes including the decompressor. But this challenge is constrained to reconstructing a single input file, not handling arbitrary inputs. If the input files are random, and you keep asking for them, there's a tiny chance you'll get one with enough repetition that even gzip could compress it. If you can key against a large set of reference data, your odds improve significantly.<p>So, I don't know if this is a practical approach given the restrictions of the contest, the cost of entering, and the expected payoff, but I would say that if it is plausible to use a large body of OS files for lookup, this could be a winnable challenge.",1349460360

I know what a lattice is, I don't know what sort of measurement they intend to make on it, I have no clue what alpha_s is, I know vaguely what quarks are but don't remember the differences between say a charm quark and a strange quark. I don't know what makes a quark ""realistic"" or not.<p>Abstract: ""We report on an estimate of _s , renormalised in the \overline{MS} scheme at the  and Z^0 mass scales, by means of lattice QCD. Our major improvement compared to previous lattice calculations is that, for the first time, no perturbative treatment at the charm threshold has been required since we have used statistical samples of gluon fields built by incorporating the vacuum polarisation effects of u/d, s and c sea quarks. Extracting _s in the Taylor scheme from the lattice measurement of the ghost-ghost-gluon vertex, we obtain _s^\overline{MS} (m_Z^2) = 0.1200(14) and _s^\overline{MS} (m_^2) = 0.339(13).""<p>No idea. Perhaps the introduction will be enlightening...<p>Hey, some progress. The paper appears to be using data from the LHC experiments that have been all over the pop-sci news for the last few years. Section 2? Math, data... Hey, section 3, conclusions. So they have given a measurement of alpha_s from lattice simulations, specifically an improved method for lattice simulation. Googling says alpha_s is the strong coupling constant, and hey, I've seen the fine-structure constant before... alpha_s has to do with ""asymptotic freedom"". Is there a 5-minute intro to the point of trying to measure alpha_s? Is there a 5-minute intro describing measuring alpha_s with lattice simulations as opposed to something else?<p>This whole exercise took me quite a bit longer than 5 minutes and I still don't feel like I understand much of anything. What's the most important part here? I'll probably forget everything I typed down by the end of the day, except perhaps that alpha_s is somehow related to the universal-constant alpha I've seen before. I'm doing this from the perspective of the ignorant person. Could the authors of the paper (or a fan of the paper who read it, understood it, and wants to explain it to me) explain to me what exactly they're doing to a sufficient degree? I mean, such that I have a clue what (if not why) the paper is trying to accomplish in a real sense, what's important about the paper, without needing to understand how they accomplish whatever the goal is, or understand all the math and science details? Probably they could, but it would take a lot more than 5 minutes. It'd take more than 5 minutes just to get the initial definitions out of the way such that I don't have too much confusion over what is being discussed. Is there a 5-minute intro to quantum chromodynamics?<p>Even Khan Academy videos are usually at least 10 minutes. His American Civics videos provide the best example for my point here.<p>As for explaining why I want to use technology X instead of Y, this is an entirely different question than the one proposed in the submission, and one that's actually a better interview question. ""Tell me about a time you were faced with a choice between competing technologies and how you justified that choice to your superiors."" If someone's asking me to explain why I want X over Y, I have three responses depending on who's asking and in what context they're asking in. The first is the rude one: ""Bug off, I don't have to justify my decision to you and you're wasting my time / company dollars having me explain something so many inference levels above your present understanding"". I don't think I've ever actually used that one, but it's a possibility.  What usually happens: ""Here's the tradeoffs I'm making, here's why I think these tradeoffs are a good set to make at this point."" But this requires I make the assumption that whoever I'm talking to <i>knows something</i>, isn't just an ignorant off the street. Fortunately at tech companies this assumption is fine. Describing superficial differences (""I want to use Python over PHP because it enforces indentation and will be prettier"", or ""I want to use DynamoDB instead of MySQL because DynamoDB isn't SQL"") is useless. You can make a lot of such useless statements in 5 minutes and completely miss the useful ones. Giving an actual explanation of the technologies and reasoning behind picking one over the other, that will take more than 5 minutes, doing otherwise is unfair to the person seeking the understanding. One should not attempt to give explanations like one gives elevator pitches.<p>The last response is taking the Feynman route and throwing up my hands in defeat, a nicer approach than the first response. ""Sorry, I just can't explain things that are so many inference levels above you. I can spend 5 minutes per level trying to build you up to where I can explain this thing you're asking about, it might take a couple days, but I can't just jump in one step from your level to here."" I can explain basic lazy evaluation in hopefully less than 5 minutes to someone who has/could pass a programming class, if they're engaged and fulfilling their part of the two-way street that is learning. If they're ignorant and want to learn, they can learn but it will take a while. If they're ignorant and don't want to learn, I have spent hours with people trying to hammer in basic algebraic concepts or programming concepts to no avail (this on top of whatever their professional and licensed teacher is doing).<p>In the realm of books, if I was asked to explain Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial, how could I even begin doing that with someone whose notion of probability is at best ""1/6 chance of getting a 6 on a die roll""? Do they even have a coherent internal model for what ""information"" is, a concept that is really quite new in human history? I have to start at a level way below where the book is at, and 5 minutes later I still won't be at the book's level and I can't explain the most important aspect of the book. Unless something like ""knowing the stuff presented in the book helps you do cool things with computers"", expanded upon for 5 minutes, is adequate. Is ""helps you learn how reality works"", expanded upon for 5 minutes, an adequate explanation for what the important aspect of the Giancoli physics book is?<p>I suspect our disagreement is more over where our standards of explanation quality are. Maybe you think trying to use a rubber band metaphor for magnetism is fair, I think it's cheating the learner. Maybe you think using shaky analogies that ""lead to all kinds of implications"" is adequate, I think such carelessness is only poisoning the well.<p>If you want to know how a candidate communicates certain pieces of information at a job, ask them how they do it. If you want to see how a candidate reasons in an argument, get into an argument. If you don't want to argue directly, help them find something relevant that they dislike and see what structure their rant about it takes. If they don't really dislike anything (or just don't want to take a stand on anything) that's also useful to know. A lot of these interview ""tricks"" purport to select for certain traits but it's usually a very indirect method at best.",1349460242

It was privileged. Sure. And there were before the crash many of us doing it. None of us had any responsibilities. Why the disdain? No one ever claimed it was more than it was. There's a leisure class at both ends of the economic spectrum. For the most part, there were very few Trustafarians. We were middle class kids who wanted to climb/write novels/surf/snowboard/insert your interest here.<p>We all sacrificed future income for those days. No need for disdain. We all make our own choices.<p>[EDIT] Here's a current stream of a couple living the dream: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Drive-Nacho-Drive/218388858200902?fref=ts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Drive-Nacho-Drive/21838885820...</a>",1349460211

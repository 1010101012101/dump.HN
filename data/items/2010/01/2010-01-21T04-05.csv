But she reports there's never been any evidence -- beyond the supporters' anecdotal warm fuzzies -- that gardens fix educational gaps, and strongly implies garden time is trading off against more beneficial instruction.<p>So I appreciated the strong point of view and ironic opening scenario -- given her beliefs it's appropriate to be a bit caustic.",1264046607

I'm assuming you're a user of Xiaonei (an almost verbatim clone of Facebook, including UI and page design, even color scheme) - can you defend the blatantly unoriginal, downright thieving tactics of Chinese tech companies when it comes to ""competing"" with their American counterparts? Perhaps this Chinese ""outclassing"" of yours is simply because many Chinese companies never put in the resources to develop anything of their own, preferring to steal and pilfer instead.<p>Perhaps Google is leaving because, as every other nation (not only the West) knows, the Chinese as a whole have fundamentally no respect for hard work. As a Chinese I am ashamed to admit this, but the truth deserves to be told regardless of how it reflects on my people: Chinese culture has no respect for the work of others, and ripping off is so normal that one hardly bats an eyelash. Whatever Google does in China will merely be copied verbatim, there's almost no point in staying in a market where all of your hard work counts for just about nothing, and there's no rule of law to protect this work from unscrupulous thieves.<p>[edit] Also, the only reason GE is ""doing fine"" is because nobody's yet figured out how to clone entire power plants. Look at companies like Apple, who originally had to import iPhone screens from Germany to avoid having the designs stolen and sold to the highest bidder by merely manufacturing it in China. This is embarrassing and shameful to me as a Chinese - we are <i>rightfully</i> known as a nation that cannot be trusted, cannot be respectful of what is rightfully someone else's. We are known globally as a nation of unscrupulous people who will throw away all semblance of civility and justice to succeed - I am ashamed to be associated with this, but yet it <i>does</i> reflect our business culture very accurately.<p>Instead of constantly looking at every move like a threat against China, and instead of looking at everyone like an enemy, perhaps China's greatest enemy is itself: we are overly aggressive, we always seek to win by someone else's destruction, and we seem incapable of forming transactions where one side doesn't get screwed. We are <i>not</i> team players, and this is going to be a very severe limitation on the advancement of China as a whole until we culturally un-fuck ourselves. Drop the constant victim complex - not everyone is out to get you.",1264046436

I maintain an application with a pretty large codebase (around 1.1 or 1.2 million LOC, it's been a year or so since I've really looked) and I wanted to change out the scripting engine we used. It used to be this VBA monstrosity, but it was ridiculously easy to change over to using Python via IronPython. It took 2 lines of code, plus another 15 or 20 lines to specify what I wanted to expose to the scripting engine. It was incredible!<p>I don't mind aspx all that much, but I see what you're saying about keeping things separated. I've never been fond of IIS and I don't see that opinion changing in the immediate future. mod_mono seems interesting, but I haven't really looked at it at all.<p>To me, the biggest win about the .net stack is the tooling; I know people like to bag on it, but the .net debugger in Visual Studio is seriously great. We maintain that huge application I was talking about with 2 developers and it's really no problem because it's very easy for us to track down bugs when they crop up - we spend 80% or more of our time on new development.<p>I'm still on a Clojure kick, so I'm avoiding F# for the time being just so I can maintain some sanity, but it's next on my language list for sure.<p>As an aside, weren't you going to be doing semi-regular posts to HN about your startup? I think you're overdue ;)",1264046435

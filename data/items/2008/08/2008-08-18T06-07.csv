279028,comment,278453,278997,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Yeah, thats what i meant. Do you use ruby for scripting blender or anything else other that RoR? Do you use it for scientific computation? Do people use it for shell scripts and small games, or GUI apps?You can do that with ruby, but for me, people learn ruby because rails is popular, python doesn't have that one big killer app, people learn python because its generally fun and useful for many stuff.",1219042231

279026,comment,278972,278972,0,0,iigs,,,"I believe that we'll see ISP NAT for customers before we see widespread adoption of IPv6 in the USA. The dynamics are all backwards for encouraging people to switch. Web site operators (and other content providers) will, in general, pay extra to have an externally reachable IPv4 address, in order to stay accessible to the ~3b nodes already on IPv4. Most home users don't know or care about IP addresses, so they're not likely to go through the trouble to fix their systems to talk to the set of systems that are reachable via IPv6, especially so when considering that the most popular sites are available on IPv4 anyway.<p>For these common users, being able to send unsolicited traffic to their nodes is actually a misfeature (SQL slammer from a few years ago comes to mind). I've always thought that an ISP could sell a NATted connection at a premium as a security feature, and the cost to deploy a solution like that would be a small fraction of the cost of engineering IPv6 into a network infrastructure if it wasn't designed with it in mind initially.<p>Perhaps my opinion is dissenting, but I'm not sure we'll ever see IPv6 (except in that alternate universe of Japan, where everything is way more awesome anyway). I have a feeling we'll keep piling on the hacks until a paradigm shift of some type.",1219042061

279022,comment,278554,278841,0,0,thwarted,,,"""Interior Decorators"" like to call themselves ""interior designers"", but true ""interior designers"" do not like to be called ""interior decorators"".  Technically, ""interior design"" is a subset/related to architecture.  ""Interior decorators"" don't know much about building materials, and don't use Pantone colors.  Interior designers know things like how wide walkways are supposed to be, how many square feet you need per-person (and how to arrange common areas to meet this legal (firecode) requirement), knows where exit signs should go, etc.  There is also a significant amount of project management work that Interior designers do, in terms of managing the build out schedules and doing a lot of the technical grunt work in a build out.",1219041146

279013,comment,278704,278704,0,0,aaroniba,,,"We do think AppJet will be the platform/framework of the future, but in the present it's a little early to compare the AppJet Framework with PHP, RoR, Django, etc.<p>AppJet was designed to be easy and make it possible to write cool little web apps with a small amount of code and a small amount of knowledge.  From this perspective, it becomes obvious why we chose JavaScript as the server language: it reduces the number of languages you need to learn by a factor of 2.<p>I think it's succeeding at what it does.  There are lots of cool apps in the app directory, and most are <500 lines of code in a single file.  Many of these apps are written by  high school students who learned programming with AppJet.  Some of my favorite include {pxl,outliner,files,wikijet,agglodex,dict,livescore}.appjet.net.<p>We are working on improving the AppJet Framework to be good for large apps.  We're also working a lot on our <i>platform</i>.  (mrtron makes a good point about platform vs. framework elsewhere in this thread).  One day, we'll tell the hacker news community that we think AppJet is a suitable replacement for PHP, Django, RoR, or whatever you're building your startup on.  But we're not there yet.<p>In the meantime, if you want to hack up a simple database-backed web app without worrying about hosting or setting up SQL or anything, AppJet is your platform.  Or if you want to learn programming with a platform that will let you do a lot knowing only a little, AppJet is your platform.",1219040090

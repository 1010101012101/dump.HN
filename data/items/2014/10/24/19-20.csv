8505625,comment,8502968,8503829,0,0,halostatue,,,"Yeah. Ubuntu’s one of the ones that have gotten better. When I was still working with C++ for multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, …) I ran an Ubuntu desktop with VMware Workstation to contain Windows in a useful (less dangerous) place. With the exception of some stupidity around hald with Ubuntu 8.04, it was pretty good (there were several other people who followed my lead on this) except that I still had to run a VM to read email (Outlook; no good connector, and the web access was suboptimal) and other stuff.<p>I could probably switch much easier to a Linux system now, but most of the systems that I’ve played with just <i>don’t</i> have the same level of polish that I expect from a desktop system, and I don’t <i>want</i> to hack on kernel drivers—it just doesn’t interest me.<p>Other people will make other choices. To make a slightly tortured analogy, I need a pre-assembled propane barbecue, because I have food to make. Other people want to go through the whole process of building their barbecue (or at least putting its pieces together), but I’d rather be cooking. <i>De gustibus</i>, ya know.",1414180754

Scala, which has similar 32-tree structures, used it before then.<p>In functional programming, binary-tree structures were common for maps and sets (and still are, in Haskell and Ocaml) because they can use comparisons without hashing and can be faster. However, those trees tend to involve ~log2 n bounces, which can become a performance problem if they&#x27;re very big. People end up preferring (less functional, and less performant due to hashing if your collection is small) hash tables.<p>The 32-tree structures are great, on the whole. Not only do they offer fast lookups, but the amount of copying that has to be done for inserts and deletions is generally very small.<p>The &quot;effectively constant&quot; language emerged as a way of saying, &quot;you&#x27;re not necessarily going to want to replace this with a hashtable at 1,000,000 elements&quot;.<p>Rich Hickey gave a talk early on about this in which he acknowledged the fact that it was still O(log n) time. As he said, <i>constants matter</i>.<p>The reason people equate O(log n) lookup with &quot;slow&quot; is that they (mistakenly) assume that n ~ 1,000,000 will <i>prima facie</i> the lookup 20x slower than it &quot;needs to be&quot;.

There have already been many peer-to-peer connecting Q&A services like Aardvark and expert networks like Pearl, as well as lighter social friend/friend of friend Q&A like Jelly.<p>What Quora purports to provide that these don&#x27;t is a (mostly) permanent corpus of knowledge that is available later.

This is of course not the kind of thing an individual needs to connect to another individual to find out (though it&#x27;s still interesting), so I think that Fountain (the app referred to in the article) will have its own niche that is very distinct from Quora&#x27;s.<p>Things like Fountain and Pearl are useful for individual experiences, and experts will make decent money if the platforms are successful, but what you end up with is the monetization of repetitive questions, rather than a resource where you can access a variety of answers for questions.

I&#x27;m not cool with people like Zoe Quinn using their incestuous relationships with the press to get a leg up on other, more deserving indies. You know, people that make good games instead of harassing suicidally depressed people, intimidating photographers, attacking other feminist organizations for competing with her charity, getting &quot;The Most Expensive Game Jam in History&quot; canceled over personal drama, attempting to censor controversy with DMCA takedown notices, and just in general being a professional victim.<p>Corruption should not be tolerated anywhere, so I&#x27;m happy some people actually give a shit and are taking a stand for once instead of forgetting about controversies the next day as usual.

The last reason is my favorite, it&#x27;s absolutely hilarious how vile and hypocritical some of these people are.<p>EDIT: As I&#x27;ve alluded to, I think GamerGate is the start of something akin to the Occupy movements for the left, or the Tea Party movement for the older right. They begin with a frenetic spark, and it can be hard to discern what &quot;they&#x27;re about,&quot; and sometimes people do bad things in their name, but you have to look past the surface to see there is a meaningful sentiment being expressed.

8505443,comment,8503912,8504965,0,0,JeanPierre,,,"I understand your concern, but I don&#x27;t really think the problem is within Clojure people: When I started out explaining the structure to other people and that most operations have O(log n) runtime, people dismissed Clojure as being too slow for practical purposes. Part of this is because programmers, not Clojure devs in particular, connotate O(log n) with &quot;much slower than O(1)&quot;. However, this data structure is incredibly much faster than the &quot;O(log n)&quot; people are generally used to.<p>And this is the problem. As you yourself say, most programmers usually associate/assume &quot;Big-O notation is intended to describe <i>how the time required for an operation grows</i> as the number of items being handled gets large&quot;.<p>But formally, this is not the case at all. O(g(x)) tells you the that the <i>worst case</i> input to the algorithm will require less operations (usually operations, sometimes memory or other things) than the function g multiplied by some positive constant. g is usually determined by the size of the input. (This definition is also simplified somewhat, but it illustrates the problem)<p>We can say that ArrayLists.add have O(n) runtime and that quicksort have O(n²) runtime, but they both also have O(n³) and O(n!) runtime.<p>In addition, Big-O does not describe how the algorithm runs in the average case, or how frequent the worst case is. In and of itself, the Big-O notation tells us almost nothing about an algorithm – you barely conclude anything from it. I guess that is part of why it has become this very simplified term with a very wibbly-wobbly definition from time to time.<p>So when you&#x27;re saying that calling it &quot;practically O(1)&quot; is lying, I agree <i>if this was in an academic context</i>. But for the average programmer (regardless of language!), O(g(x)) is usually thought of as the &quot;worst case runtime for an algorithm&quot;. Since the actual runtime is – well – effectively constant, I considered it okay.<p>---<p>That being said, I have formally explained the persistent vector if you&#x27;re interested in the academic version.

Is having a larger number of weak connections better than a smaller number of strong connections? Are online connections as meaningful and satisfying as offline connections?<p>I&#x27;m always somewhat skeptical about psychology studies for a number of reasons, but the studies that have been conducted on Facebook and online social networking are consistent enough to suggest that your argument warrants deeper analysis. Many of these studies, like this one[1], find that Facebook increases feelings of loneliness and unhappiness.<p>I think you should consider that Facebook and services like it implicate a number of human emotions and desires, many of which are not always a positive influence&#x27;s in one&#x27;s life if indulged without limit. That doesn&#x27;t mean that Facebook is without positive value, but I think its success is a lot more complicated than it &quot;connects you with people that you don&#x27;t see daily, lets you know about birthdays, events, comments and what not.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2419419/All-lonely-Facebook-friends-Study-shows-social-media-makes-MORE-lonely-unhappy-LESS-sociable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2419419/All-lonely-F...</a>",1414178561

Before you start optimizing for terms, however, get as much information as you can about your prospective partners and decide who you most want to work with.<p>3. Choose based on who you want to work with, and try to use the competitive situation to get you the best possible terms.<p>When we were reviewing term sheets, we did a lot of diligence, in particular talking to other entrepreneurs who were in -- or had been in -- the portfolios of the funds.  Of course you want to understand the basics of how working with that person or firm was, but you also want to get some color on how things played out for the deals that went sideways or failed.<p>Startups often have bumps along the road, and opportunities present themselves for VC&#x27;s to take advantage or take the high road.  How the partner(s) in question have handled themselves when faced with these options, and how the fund dynamic played into that, will tell you a lot about how things are likely to go for you under similar circumstances.<p>Good luck!",1414177706

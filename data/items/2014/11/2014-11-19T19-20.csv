8632210,comment,8629885,8629885,0,0,kolanos,,,"I think this is only the beginning. The Linux community is in the midst of an identity crisis. Linux has a well established history of fragmentation. Fragmentation represents choice, flexibility, modularity and so forth. It also represents control for the individual user. For a long time, this was considered Linux&#x27;s biggest strength. It was the anti-Windows. However, in the past few years a unification movement has grown, largely inspired by OSX. I think GNOME has pushed the hardest in this direction, systemd is just the latest battle. The success of Ubuntu has also added fuel to the unification fire as it continues to break away from the old guard and build their own unified experience (Unity). While I think unification has its merits, it will continue to meet significant resistance as long as there is still a large contingent of fragmentists (just made that term up). I think it will come to a head in the near future and the Linux community will break into two sides; the unification side and the fragmentation side.  The irony is that the unification side stands as much a chance of fragmentation, since it appears Ubuntu will continue to move away from GNOME.  But so is the nature of OSS.",1416426817

To write code is to interact with the extremely entangled software environments that we have cumulatively been building up for over 60 years now.<p>Anything beyond Fibonacci sequences will require you to spill out into lots and lots of domain-specific areas and subdisciplines. A proficient programmer in general will also need at least basic skills in system administration.<p>To build a real useful application intersects with areas such as network protocols (which is immeasurably vast, depending on what layer you pick and how much you abstract), widget toolkits (and the wider quandaries of computer graphics, windowing, displays, etc.), cryptography (which pretty much intersects with most bodies of computer science), the workings of the kernel, dynamic linker (thus object files and libraries), the C library...<p>Profiling an application will likely require you to learn some complexity theory. I/O-bound applications will require you to learn how file systems, I/O schedulers and disks work. System programming is a rabbit hole of its own, with POSIX alone just about being an independent branch.<p>The bottom line is that programming can mean just about anything. And since programming itself is not innate, but a member of its own in the tangled web of computing, programming is thus a vast body of theory itself, a lot of which one will need to learn, unless they intend on staying frozen.<p>Paradoxically, the more we try to make things so that people won&#x27;t have to be specialized in order to use them, the more we necessitate huge drifts of specialization in the people that want to do more than cursory tasks.<p>While picking a few components and sticking with them is probably necessary at least in professional environments to maintain sanity and interoperability, it is not very realistic for hobbyists and learners.<p>Of course, if you just want to write macros to automate tedious tasks, you can get by with the basics. But that is pretty much something that will end up being born from necessity, and likely self-discovered rather than taught through compulsory means.",1416426629

(US debt ceiling crisis, etc.) A chart of the S&P 500 shows more-or-less an upward trend over the past five years; certainly since the beginning of 2013 there have hardly been any wild swings.<p>This can lull investors into a false sense of security about the distributions of returns; just because returns have been steady (i.e. low volatility) over the past few years does not mean things will remain this way.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute the long-term average yearly return of ~8%. What I am saying is that, as with many other things, averages don&#x27;t tell the true story. One year, you could be down 30-40% in equities and another you could be up 30%. Getting a constant 8% return every year is unlikely.<p>For some long-term investors, they aren&#x27;t concerned about the volatility and this is a perfectly rational thing. However, there are some people who cannot bear the volatility of such investments and will be in constant worry. Such individuals would likely have to apportion a higher percentage of their to less risky assets and perhaps miss out on some overall return.<p>I heard of many people freaking out just because the mini-correction that happened in mid-October.

If the company isn&#x27;t setup to handle the (relatively large) workload of dealing with junior/novice developers, of course they aren&#x27;t going to be interested in you. The gender thing is, I&#x27;d like to think, not as big a deal as the author claims--if it was, well, to hell with those folks.<p><i>If you are a woman or belong to other underrepresented groups, it’s totally different. Besides being experienced you need to have a blog, website, GitHub account and contribute to open source.</i><p>I think that that is expected of <i>any</i> new developers these days...at least, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. Failing that, an honest explanation of <i>why</i> you don&#x27;t have those things (&quot;I&#x27;m working other gigs&quot;, &quot;I do a lot of code at my company, but can&#x27;t share it&quot;, etc.) would do just fine.<p><i>Why don’t I have a blog, or my own website? Because there’s so much harassment going on nowadays that I’m actually scared to put my thoughts on the internet.</i><p>So, the author isn&#x27;t blogging because they are scared. I don&#x27;t want to work with people that scare easily--especially in a startup. I want somebody with <i>backbone</i>, which the author actually seems to have seeing as how she blogged this. The argument of &quot;because sometimes people on the internet are terrible and mean&quot; is a shitty reason not to do something.<p><i>Why don’t I contribute to open source? Because I tried, and people were unwelcoming and even cruel.</i><p>This is the case regardless of gender, and even so there are a great many projects on Github that would appreciate even a little help with the docs. Sure, the Linux kernel or OpenBSD or whatever probably are harsh to newcomers, but there are literally thousands upon thousands of projects on Github or Sourceforge that will accept patches even in the form of an email and be thankful for the help.<p><i>It wouldn’t be so hard to establish bootcamps and let people learn for free so you can hire them afterwards or actually hire them as interns and mentor them, turn them into good developers.</i><p>Teaching is <i>hard</i>. Teaching without additional compensation takes a whole lot of passion, and those folks are probably doing so outside of work anyways. If I got a recruiter fee for every promising novice I&#x27;d run into that then flaked out on my, I could afford to teach full time <i>and</i> invest in my business ecosystem.<p>There&#x27;s this idea that &quot;If we just <i>teach</i> these people, we&#x27;ll get something back and more developers!&quot;. Fuck that. We&#x27;ve seen firsthand that most devs we train--say, in Houston--just end up moving to other places, or flaking out before they finish three or four sessions.<p>Bootcamps exist because, unless they have money/tuition on the line, <i>people suck at self-study</i>.

I mostly do Java, with a substantial dash of JavaScript and Ruby, and in all of those languages, i waste time tracking nulls to their source. A language which blew up as soon as an unacceptable null arose would be huge win.<p>Actually, having moved from entirely Java to only mostly Java, one thing i&#x27;ve noticed is that in dynamic languages, wrongly-typed objects can propagate as freely as nulls. I spent an unforgivable fraction of today tracking down a bug in a JavaScript app where a framework was passing the wrong type of model to a view. In a strongly-typed language, that would have failed as soon as the framework did that (or perhaps even at compile time), but in JS, it failed in a cryptic way hundreds of statements later.<p>For extra comedy value, it turned out that the reason the framework was doing that was because i had passed a null into one of its configuration properties - because i&#x27;d innocently written something like:<p><pre><code>  Initech.Commerce.CartView = Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
    childView: Initech.Commerce.ItemView
  });
</code></pre>
And since the views are defined in files cartView.js and itemView.js, and since the files are loaded in alphabetical order (because we&#x27;re just throwing them out of Rails and not using RequireJS or similar, i know, i know), at the point at which CartView is defined, Initech.Commerce.ItemView is null!<p>Basically, JavaScript is a language only a Dwarf Fortress fan could love.

--------------------------------------------------<p>What we&#x27;re doing:<p>- Kitchensurfing is an online marketplace where users can find outstanding local chefs to cook for them, at home. Our core mission is twofold: to provide a platform for chefs to grow their independent businesses, while making it possible for people to connect over great food.<p>- Line chefs at the nicest restaurants in the world make at most $12-15/hour, yet the food they make is sold to diners at a hefty markup. We&#x27;re trying to bridge the gap.<p>- People are conditioned to expect great food in restaurants — and rarely elsewhere. We want to change the way people eat, while preserving the efficiency and hospitality of a great restaurant experience.<p>- Most internet service companies attempt to decrease human interaction through software efficiency. We’re building a company that does the opposite. We think there&#x27;s something magical about having a chef in your kitchen while you relax and enjoy the company of your guests.<p>How we&#x27;re doing it:<p>- We’re committed to code quality and productivity. With those values in mind, we pair program, test drive and practice continuous integration in a Rails/iOS environment. We don&#x27;t work &#x27;startup hours&#x27;, just normal ones.<p>- We&#x27;re a small team (currently 8 engineers). We rotate often between pairs and across projects.<p>- We deploy code whenever we finish a feature. As an example, last week we deployed to production 34 times.<p>Who we&#x27;re looking for:<p>- You&#x27;re interested in working with iOS and pair programming the majority of the time. You want to write tests for any feature you implement.<p>- You&#x27;re more interested in building a great product and shipping features than you are in figuring out the cleverest solution to a problem.",1416425694

Phone: 337-384-5612<p>Ray Istre has been busy working on art. His most recent series is related to money and Bitcoin in particular. The artist has had an interest in various forms of money for a long time and his gold and silver related cartoons are seen on Kitco.com, the number one gold and silver web site in the world. He now brings his visual abilities to the world of Bitcoin and is perfectly willing to do business in the new currency.<p>His most recent works are mixed media paintings combining realistic, pop imagery with abstract design and coloring. The art incorporates designs from US Currency, such as Franklins portrait in the One Hundred Dollar Bill as well as George Washington and Andrew Jackson. Each of these leaders had significant opinions and history related to money and its use in the United States. &quot;The combination of iconic imagery and colorful abstract design is related to things we as humans understand as well as things we may not understand&quot; says the artist.<p>&quot;Bitcoin is a form of money as more retailers, artists and service related businesses accept it as payment&quot; Istre says. His work is featured on the popular web site, Bit Premier ( www.bitpremier.com ), where there are many luxury items including jewelry and real estate to buy with Bitcoin.<p>The artists work can be seen at www.artpal.com/ray. The art is available in the form of Framed Prints, Stretched Canvas or on Coffee Mugs. See more of his art work at www.rayistre.com.

You then assemble those parts (functions, really) into 3D shapes for visualization.  And you lay out those same parts in a plane for 2D fabrication.<p>The main difficulty I had was that it seems to be necessary to calculate everything.  As a simple example, suppose I&#x27;ve got a triangle-shaped part, and stick the flat side of it on a square part.  What&#x27;s the distance from the tip of triangle to the opposite flat side of the square?  OpenSCAD knows, in some sense, because it drew it.  But inside my OpenSCAD script, I don&#x27;t, and I have to calculate the geometry in my code.<p>If there was some way to specify and capture the position of that point (or whatever), then it would be much easier to connect parts together.",1416425569

And when you find the &#x27;bad&#x27; ones, you can send a note to the project (which can respond anywhere from &quot;great, thanks for the review!&quot; to &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it why not send us a pull request with what you think is a better version.&quot;)<p>What this means in practice is that companies that use open source extensively in their operation, become slower and slower to innovate as they are carrying the weight of a thousand different systems of checks on code quality and robustness, which people using closed source will start delivering faster and faster as they effectively partition the review/quality question to the person selling them the software and they focus on their product innovation.<p>There was an interesting, if unwitting, simulation of this going on inside Google when I left, where people could check-in changes to the code base that would have huge impacts across the company causing other projects to slow to a halt (in terms of their own goals) while they ported to the new way of doing things. In this future world changes, like the recently hotly debated systemd change, will incur costs while the users of the systems stop to re-implement in the new context, and there isn&#x27;t anything to prevent them from paying this cost again and again. A particularly Machievellan proprietary source vendor might fund programmers to create disruptive changes to expressly inflict such costs on their non-customers.<p>I know, too tin hat, but it is what I see coming.",1416425381

It&#x27;s always good to see what this field looks like from a newbies&#x27; eyes.<p>If it only it were so simple as keeping a small tool set and a dev team committed to it. You can certainly build a business from scratch with a small toolset. But as the business adapts to customers, you always start to find things that customers want that the tools do not support. In initial dev, you don&#x27;t necessarily care, but when you&#x27;re live, it&#x27;s better to implement than say &#x27;no&#x27; to executive management and sales in most (not all) cases.<p>Once you modify the tools a bit to support the unique business, you&#x27;re no longer able to keep new developers focused on a small toolset, because you&#x27;ve customized. New devs may not agree and may look for ways to work around the customizations. Soon, you have a unique codebase that is valuable- central- to the business, and your changes have crept in to the point that off-the-shelf devs and tools and upgrades don&#x27;t work.<p>Now you&#x27;re in maintenance mode. Code schools don&#x27;t teach maintenance, but it is the lifeblood of the software business.  Developers avoid maintenance jobs. They try to find new, greenfield work. That&#x27;s why we end up with so many disposable business models, 3 year dev-to-acquisition cycles, and ridiculous amounts of abandoned code.<p>Maintenance is hard. Much harder than development. But it&#x27;s much more important. Anyone can launch an app that builds a business. Not everyone can adapt and grow that business with code changes that require getting out of the dev comfort zone.<p>Code schools don&#x27;t teach this because they don&#x27;t want to expose aspiring coders who just want to get rich to the grimy dirty details of a real profession. But ask yourself this- would we have cars and highways if all we trained were new car designers (not mechanics or road builders)?",1416425258

A thoroughly inculturated human can usually navigate these complex systems of values in a way that remains extremely difficult to implement algorithmically.<p>In the meantime, when the algorithms we have fail to perform as we&#x27;d like, the damage they cause is multiplied by the very efficiency gain that makes them appealing.

It just seems to me &quot;currently accepted medical use&quot; is pretty unambiguous, there is SOME, that is, other than none, currently accepted medical use so their definition is wrong on its face. I&#x27;m surprised that nobody told them &quot;Look, you&#x27;re using English wrong(ly)&quot; as a way to challenge the law.&quot;</i><p>Their classification of marijuana as having &quot;no accepted medical use&quot; is silly on its face, and I hope I adequately gave that impression in my comment. I&#x27;m not agreeing with it. I&#x27;m just pointing it out.<p>Unfortunately, changing the DEA&#x27;s opinion is harder than just sending them the medical literature, and pointing out the contradictions in their position. This is a problem that needs to be addressed through the legislative process. (The DEA follows federal policy; it doesn&#x27;t necessarily establish or alter federal policy). Fortunately, change is happening at the state level. If we reach the point where most states recognize medical uses for marijuana, then eventually, the federal government will have to cave on its hard line. Or so the thinking goes.<p>English is indeed a complex language, and it&#x27;s also filled with the sorts of loaded terms with which lawyers have a field day. For instance, consider the word &quot;accepted&quot; in the phrase &quot;accepted medical use.&quot; Accepted by <i>whom</i>? Who decides whether to officially &quot;accept&quot; a medical use? Is it the DEA? Is it the medical and scientific community? Is it the legislative branch of the federal government? Is it the judicial branch? Is it someone else? If this issue were ever to come to court, the DEA could argue that there is no &quot;accepted&quot; consensus.

8631897,comment,8625222,8625733,0,0,oyvindkinsey,,,"Based on the inference, we can imagine a case where Flow would flag certain boundaries as &#x27;unsafe&#x27;, allowing a transform to inject dynamic type safety checks using the same type information Flow has available.<p>For instance, you could imagine a function calling into some unknown api, where we would need to constrain the type of the variable to the expected one to avoid `any` being applied to it. While the library files do provide typing of external dependencies, this doesn&#x27;t protect you from bugs in those libraries!
The same applies to api&#x27;s that are explicitly typed as `any`, but which <i>should</i> return a certain type.<p>Having Flow add a dynamic assertion on the type here would allow the rest of the program to remain type safe, knowing that a violation is guaranteed to halt execution.<p>While dynamic strong typing is also used at Facebook, we&#x27;re not quite ready to launch this as an extension to Flow.",1416423701

8631895,comment,8630699,8631603,0,0,soneca,,,"Well, do consider that I just copied/pasted some words I had already written before! :)<p>But to live up to your comment, I will take the time give my opinion about your specific case.
You have a vision, apparently a passion, a successfull kickstarter campaign and, more important, proved traction. So you should be able to attract top talent. So, don&#x27;t settle for anything less than the person who can build all you envision and share your passion for the business.<p>You communicate very well your success (in your &quot;about us&quot;), but for the CTO I think you might need to communicate your vision to what the CTO will have to accomplish as well (I imagine you are not hiring a CTO just to handle the website and the shop - as they are both looking great without a CTO, but aiming for more ambitious tech-related paths).<p>If you happen to find someone very good ready for full-time job, in a position that wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to ask him/her to work part-time, still keep it temporary and starting with small projects. He/she will have to earn his position as CTO, no matter how shiny his portfolio might be.
Give him a 2-week project, than another, then a 1-month project, always paying him market rate and respecting his time. But don&#x27;t make the decision to hire the CTO before that test.<p>And take your time to find the right promess. A good way to simultaneously &quot;keep looking&quot; and &quot;waiting for the right person&quot; is to hire contractors, with a lower bar, for things you need built in the short term. Don&#x27;t promise any CTO position, just regular freelance job for what you need build. Test one, then another, no expectations, no hurry. There is another thread in HN from whoishiring that is &quot;Who wants to be hired?&quot;. I would say is a good place to look. The last one: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8542898"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8542898</a><p>good luck<p>EDIT: Ah! And I loved your product.

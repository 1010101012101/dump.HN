907283,comment,907220,907241,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That's not how things work out in practice. More common is that gifted students get annoyed at having to do unchallenging busywork and become annoyed at the whole system. When school no longer becomes worthwhile or engaging (at either the top or the bottom of the spectrum) then it becomes little more than a prison.<p>Being ahead of the curve in public schools doesn't mean that you get to skip out on classes, you have no greater free time than any of the kids struggling with the material (except perhaps it takes you less time to do homework).<p>Best case scenario is that unchallenged gifted students take advantage of the most advanced classes available and learn on their own at home. Worst case scenario is that they become jaded and disenchanted with school and learning, stop doing school work because it's beneath their capability, and act out in worse ways.<p>Lucky for me, some time around the 8th grade or so I turned from the second type of student (falling behind, increasingly disengaged) to the first type (being recognized as one of a handful of top students in my senior class). I was lucky enough to attend an excellent public high-school with good teachers and lots of advanced classes, if those classes and teachers would not have been available to me I don't know for sure what I would have done.",1256709595

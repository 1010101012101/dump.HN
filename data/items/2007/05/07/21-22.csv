If the money isn't worth the risk, they know it better than you do -- and if you disagree with them, it's probably because you're applying your assumptions to their situation, not that you know more about mining safety than they do.",1178575105
20329,comment,20133,20133,0,0,leisuresuit,,,"I wish part time work was easier to find. I would much rather work 20 hours a week for someone else than 40 hours a week. It'd give me a lot more time to work on my own projects.<p>You can only be so productive anyway. Just because you spend 8 or 9 hours a day at work doesn't mean you're working the entire time you're there. More like 1/3 of the time is actually spent thinking and working. It's not even that you're being lazy, it's just you burn out if you work too hard and too often.<p>The strange thing is, nobody who's in a position to hire understands this. And if you do find part-time tech work, you're most likely going to be paid LESS per hour than you would if you were doing the same thing full-time.",1178575002

My friend lives on 37th and 5th so if it wouldn't be too far, I wouldn't mind meeting for lunch on a Saturday some time and meeting people from New York and try to form a joint Boston New York community.

20325,comment,20249,20302,0,0,webwright,,,"""Then add in the free legal representation, negotiation advice, free training etc etc""<p>Wow.  Free?  Really?  Where do you think the money comes from?  The union has operative expenses that it pays for with the dues you pay.  You PAY for those things and the overhead it takes to support them.  Your employer probably pays a bit for them too, and as a result probably increases prices or decreases employee benefits to compensate.<p>Try owning and running a business sometime and tell me how much you think it would benefit you (and your business) to be ""democratized"".",1178574549

20323,comment,20249,20311,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"The whole point of capitalism is that people are basically going to be greedy no matter what, but if you tell them, ""Well, be as greedy as you like, but to get money you have to convince other people to give it to you, and the best way to do that is usually to make something they like,"" then things work out ok. Of course, we still need regulation to ensure that the best way to make money really is to make something people like, but outside of that there's no reason to blame geed per se. Greed is the engine that drives the machine!",1178574371

20316,comment,20133,20133,0,0,webwright,,,"I built a company as a ""part-time founder"".  I think it's quite do-able and really forces you to focus your time.  Parkinson's Law states that tasks tend to expend to fill to time allotted for them...  That's true with Founders as well.<p>That said, I think your day job needs to be fairly light for this to work.  At the time, I was doing light consulting after having sold my first company.<p>I'm currently working on another little startup idea (<a href=""http://www.rescuetime.com)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rescuetime.com)</a> but it's been moving a LOT slower, as my day job is something I invest a lot more time and energy into.<p>Of course, it very much depends on the scope of the problem you are trying to solve.  You're never going to build the next salesforce.com as a PT founder. ;-)",1178573684

20314,comment,20249,20307,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"At what point is a union or a legislature necessary, here? If I want to do something dangerous to myself, should I leave it up to Washington's Finest to assess the risks for me? Why on earth would I do that? They have every incentive to be cautious (they'll get blamed if they okay risks and I still get hurt) and no reason not to be (if my work is approved and I'm unhurt, I get the benefits; if it isn't approved, we'll never know if they were wrong).<p>Regulators have less information than entrepreneurs. Regulators have a bias towards caution; entrepreneurs would suffer for it. So you're advocating a system in which uninformed people with a vested interest in my failure are responsible for choosing whether or not I have a chance to succeed. I'm afraid you need more of a defense for that than a smug smattering of ""should""s.",1178572715

20310,comment,20147,20147,0,0,sabat,,,"Dreamhost for early stages + proof of concept. Why? Because 1) they're as cheap as anyone, and 2) they give you more bandwidth than anyone else. For early stages, I think they'll work just fine.<p>Once you see a growth pattern, though, you'll want to consider VPS or dedicated hosting. VPS should work well if the ISP can guarantee host performance (CPU, disk, etc).<p>A few options:<p>- Amazon EC2. This is cool because you only pay for what you use -- your bandwidth is measured and you're charged for what you actually use, not for a fixed limit. For disk space, it uses Amazon S3, where you also pay for what you use. The Xen machine specs are good enough for most of us. And, Amazon just lowered prices on S3 and EC2. Bad news, though: EC2 is still in limited beta. And who knows when they'll be out of that. :-(<p>- Sun's deal with startups, which was posted here the other day, looks pretty good, especially the Joyant hosting deal @ <a href=""http://www.joyent.com/partners/sun/sse."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joyent.com/partners/sun/sse.</a> Only ""problem"" is that you're using Solaris. For some people that is not a problem.<p>- actual VPS hosting: in my cursory search, I think Teknet unmanaged (<a href=""http://www.tektonic.net/unmanaged.html)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tektonic.net/unmanaged.html)</a> looks pretty good, as long as you're technical enough to handle the virtual server yourself. (And you should be.) Their most expensive pkg gives you more disk space than other providers seem to (80G), and more bandwidth (800Gb) -- to me those are  big issues. That's for $100/mo, which is a good deal IMHO. Unix-only, CentOS, Fedora Core, Suse, Debian, Ubuntu.",1178572130

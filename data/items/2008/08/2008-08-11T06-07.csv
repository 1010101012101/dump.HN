I remember having to explain that it was ""kind of like Yahoo, but with good search and none of the other features"", and they were always like, ""well, good luck with that.""

See for example <a href=""http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/23/1816257&tid=107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/23/1816257&#3...</a> 
""No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.""<p>But they did keep at it, and the iTunes app was a much the innovation as the iPod.<p>My take is that as a small player you have to be strategic. Not everything that you try (your tactics) will succeed. As to how long a new technology takes, it's worth reading ""The Long Nose of Innovation"" <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jan2008/id2008012_297369.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jan2008/id20080...</a> on how long an invention takes to become a successful product. Ten years is a reasonable time frame. Google and Apple built on considerable earlier work. Google's money making innovation was their advertising model, without that having the best search engine technology might not have allowed them to prosper.",1218437012

Higher taxes to reduce consumption(Economists call these Pigovian taxes) seem to be a good choice to reduce emissions in the short term, but technological advances provide the long-term hope.",1218436150

Until then, wind power requires massive energy subsidies from fossil fuels to the extent that it doesn't actually help much.",1218436071

People will be able to issue you a cease and desist order on the cheap, but the odds of it ever going before a judge are equally low. Business methods patents are notoriously hard to enforce as well.<p>Many big companies collect patents to have as assets. They rarely actually enforce them because it costs too much money (even for them). While your product might dance around infringing on this patent or that, the odds of anyone actually doing anything against you are very low.",1218434941

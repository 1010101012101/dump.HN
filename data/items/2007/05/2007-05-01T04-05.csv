What would you folks recommend?<p>If it matters, I want the logo to be a Dutch windmill but futuristic looking (or a windmill/robot hybrid type of deal).  I'll announce my startup on here soon, hopefully with a logo :-)",1177994217

Besides the fact that generating them requires (usually) exercise (for example, for endorphines and melatonin/cortisol/tyroxine fine-tunning), and/or yoga-style body control.<p>A report from your friendly biomedical biologists.",1177992178

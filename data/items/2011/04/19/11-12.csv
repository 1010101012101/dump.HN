2462324,comment,2460499,2460499,1,0,marknutter,,,"Of course it's a bubble. Just like the housing crisis, there's been a huge amount of speculation when it comes to higher education.  The belief is that if we give out cheap and easy loans to as many students as we can they will not only be able to easily pay those loans back but also become much more valuable in the long term, just like all the McMansions in the housing market. The Universities respond to all this easy cash by raising their prices to try to distinguish themselves from other Universities and the students respond to this by accepting an ever increasing debt load because of their undying faith that they will land a high paying job when they graduate.<p>The Universities aren't on the hook for these loans, which makes it even worse than the housing crisis. The students are on the hook, but they won't be able to pay them back, which means it will fall on the US taxpayer's shoulders to bail everybody out. The solution would be to stop issuing these cheap loans to all but the most qualified students entering into the most useful fields (science/engineering and not art-history/sports medicine). Once the money party stops, Universities will be forced to lower their prices, and cheaper education will become more prevalent as smaller institutions scramble to fill the huge increase in demand for cheap, effective education.<p>But no, we have a ""right to education.""

Because JSON\ndoesn't explicitly facilitate choice or references, they can't be\nautomatically extracted (in the rare cases where someone implements\nthis, they do it in their own non-standard way on top of JSON). JSON\nalso doesn't represent the idea of productions - fair enough, since\nproductions are a schema/grammar-level concept, which simply don't\nappear in an instance. (In general, there are many different ways of\ndividing up a grammar into production that yield identical languages\nie. the set of possible instances.)<p>2) representing this schema in C# classes. This is conceptually\nstraightforward, once you've got the schema.<p>In practice, these two steps almost disappear, even conceptually,\nbecause (with the exception of lists), you are just making classes\nthat have the equivalent contents to each object in the JSON instance.<p>i.e. you can see it as an isomorphism:<p><pre><code>  mapping from JSON ""objects"" (within {}) to C# classes; and\n  recursively within that, from\n    JSON ""fields"" to C# fields and\n    JSON values (int, boolean, string etc) to C# primitive types.\n</code></pre>\n(BTW: The mapping of objects to classes is instance-to-schema.)<p>Lists are an exception to this isomorphism:<p><pre><code>  mapping a JSON list (within []) to a C# list/array,\n    the _elements_ of a JSON list are not _all_ mapped -\n    only one is mapped (eg. a JSON ""object"" is mapped to a class)</code></pre>",1303212665

Anxiety in particular often presents in an almost paralyzing manner - being accountable to a therapist in that case is extremely valuable. It's also easy to dismiss certain ideas when reading them that a real live therapist won't let you ignore so easily - for example, I learned breathing and focus exercises that I would have felt silly trying if it weren't for my therapist. Possibly most importantly, a good therapist will understand your condition better than you do, and advise you accordingly.

What are the electrically charged parts of an atom? How does central banking work? How do red blood cells bind to oxygen?<p>If you will only accept as fact information that you have personally verified, you will know a very small collection of facts. The sensible thing to do in many cases is to appeal to authority: the collective opinion of experts in a field.<p>Heck, even in one's own area of specialty, one can't know everything.

Right now, with the facebook credits option in the same page as other alternatives, 40% of our users prefer to pay through facebook credits. When we first set it up, their documentation contained errors and omissions. They also need to work on a plug-and-play iframe option, like other payment processors do. Those issues aside, the payment flow is very smooth and frictionless on the user's side.<p>Their developer support is horrible. We receive a daily digest with 2 tab separated reports in a zip file, and that's all. Up until recently we weren't even notified that we are getting paid. Once, we tried to contact them about their billing information, and they gave us the wrong answer (which resulted in us paying a penalty to the tax office).

2462248,comment,2462040,2462040,4,0,mgkimsal,,,"""Self diagnosing"" can be dangerous, and you should probably seek out some professional guidance as well - possibly two or three to see if there's any consensus.<p>I want to say I felt the same during the highschool->university transition.  I think I did have similar attitudes for several years.  One of the only things I learned during that period is that self-pity is not attractive or desirable on any level - eventually it wasn't even attractive to myself.<p>You may not be destined to have a lot of friends outside of class or work, and that's <i>100% fine</i>.  I've never had <i>many</i> friends, but I do work at having deeper friendships with the ones I do have, and I've found that's something that can only come with a mixture of time and experience.  As we've grown up and apart, my few friends and I stay in touch, and it's been great.  I'd rather have these few strong friendships than a bunch of the casual ""hi-hello"" kind.<p>You made all these ""friends"" in HS simply because of shared geography - everyone was forced to be in school, so there wasn't much of a choice.  It's natural that most of those 'friendships' won't survive.  Don't dwell on the fact most of them weren't solid or strong in the first place.  Even if many of them appeared strong, solid and ""for life"", trust me, 99% of them aren't.<p>You may want to consider taking some acting lessons and/or public speaking lessons - joining a local toastmasters group, for example.  If your public speaking is good, you'll naturally have a point of conversation with people, and that will naturally lead to many other tangents, yet in a controlled space.<p>One of the things I've learned over the years is that many people lack a self-confidence, or at least feel awkward in social situations.  Not everyone, of course, but many more than I'd guessed.  I'd assumed everyone else already had it 'figured out', and that assumption has led to some bad decisions over the years (based on assuming people were intentionally excluding me, for example).  Be assertive/proactive, even when you don't feel it (that's where the acting lessons come in) and you'll be regarded as such - people judge you by the behaviours you exhibit, not what you think inside your head.<p><i>I</i> consider myself an introvert - scored highly <i>I</i> on Meyers-Briggs for years - but most people who know me might consider me an extrovert these days.  I may even have changed some over 20 years on Meyers-Briggs, but I still consider many of the core <i>I</i> traits to be mine.  However, I've learned to be able to be 'on' socially, which has led to some good friendships based on professional interests, and some of those are leading to stronger friendships outside the original shared interests.  Only time will tell for certain, but I'm enjoying seeing where they lead.<p>I also realize I'm now talking past your original point a little bit by not addressing the 'friends' thing as much as just 'being in public'.  Being in public and groups of shared interests will lead to some friendships forming, but few will form if you're a wallflower who never talks to anyone.<p>Trust me, you can change over time, but you need to adjust how you think of other people, and you need to be forceful in getting what you want.  If you see someone you think you'd like to know better, ask them to grab a cup of coffee, or instigate that with a few people from work or a local club.  Meeting outside the regular group/work setting can let you develop/craft/express more of your own public persona without violating any of the norms of the original group.  You can see how people react, and make changes accordingly.  Lather, rinse, repeat.<p>Lastly, don't work hard at building <i>meaningful</i> relationships.  Well... don't ignore them, but the most meaningful friendships I have are ones I don't have to 'work' at so much, because the other person is just as interested in keeping it going.  My deepest friendships now started off very casually, at work/school, and in one case we really didn't even like each other at first.  We each assumed too much about the other.<p>""Work"" at friendships - yes - you need to sacrifice your own time for the other person, but if they're never giving back to you, it's not a friendship, you're being used, so get out.<p>You're young.  You can change your life and attitudes and behaviours to be whatever you want.  Don't waste this time.",1303211424
2462247,comment,2461585,2461585,5,0,csallen,,,"Dropbox didn't lie. This is simply a misinterpretation (or misunderstanding) of what's meant by the phrase ""Dropbox employees aren't able to access user files"". It's not the same as saying ""It's impossible."" The fact is, if you send a company your unencrypted data, it's obviously <i>possible</i> for them to view it at some point. Otherwise they could never encrypt it in the first place. So when they say that employees aren't able to access it, they mean that they, as a company, <i>choose</i> not to access it.<p>A good analogy is the post office. Anyone who works there and handles your mail could, if they so desired, tear open your package and steal the cookies your mother sent you. We trust them anyway, because we know they take precautions to ensure it doesn't happen. Dropbox is the same, but even tougher (I doubt the average Dropbox employee has access to their decryption mechanisms, but plenty of people at the post office can unseal your envelopes).<p>That said, to not acknowledge it as even <i>possible</i> for the company you send your data to you be able to access that data seems, to me, a bit naive.

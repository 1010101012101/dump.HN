10950214,comment,10947023,10947023,0,0,mdip,,,"Based on my experience with a few phones I own, there&#x27;s a few things that could be happening here:<p>It was mentioned the &quot;SSID&quot;/MAC address problem.  It&#x27;s possible that they have a home router with its default SSID and are encountering a MAC address collision (assuming MAC address is <i>always</i> taken into account, which I&#x27;m not sure that it is).  Their router is likely part of some database that the GPS uses when the phones enter an area with WiFi but no cellular service or line of sight to the satellites.  I had a similar failure every time I went indoors to an archery facility I visited weekly for three months. Both my wife&#x27;s and my phone would think we were a clear 30 miles away in another city the second we got far enough into the building to lose cellular service.  I dug into it and discovered it was using WiFi APs to get location.  I think the archery place has another location in that <i>other</i> spot, so it&#x27;s possible they swapped WiFi gear at some point, but it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess.<p>Another possibility, hinted at in the article, is that there&#x27;s no other location data available to the stolen phone (no mapped WiFi, no cellular service) but it has an IP address so the devices are falling back to Geo IP which is <i>extremely</i> inaccurate (my IP address changed recently and I am now a Canadian according to location services on my PCs with no GPS capabilities -- 200 miles off).  It could be a circumstance of &quot;that IP isn&#x27;t known, but that block is owned by <i>x</i> ISP and here&#x27;s a general location of where that is ... only the little dot happens to land on their house.<p>It would be <i>really smart</i> for apps that track location for theft purposes to keep a reasonable history.  If it&#x27;s a mobile phone, the last known high-accuracy reading from the GPS should be presented along with lower accuracy results to help in situations like this.  I&#x27;d imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be terribly difficult to correlate several readings over a period of time and discard ones that are clearly not sane (as would have been the case with my phone in the archery place).  A bonus would be to perform other actions when the device is marked &quot;stolen&quot;, like take photos at certain intervals and upload them to the cloud to make it easier to &quot;prove&quot; your phone is in the hands of someone it shouldn&#x27;t be (one of the tools I had did something like this).",1453427705

America or Europe, ads are no exception.<p>Also whats up with Indonesia? they have a GDP 4 times that of say Ireland, the individual income is still quite low but as far as Indonesia as a country goes they probably have bigger purchasing power than many European nations.<p>Also it really depends on what you advertise because in many places you can&#x27;t disregard income inequality if you are talking about countries with ~300M> people they might have more &quot;rich&quot; people than many other smaller European nation so while the average purchasing power within a country isn&#x27;t that impressive it&#x27;s actual purchasing power might be quite considerable.<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve at least noticed on the few ads i did managed to receive while being in China, HK, India and the Philippines is that instead of ads for Spotify, GoPro, or Clash of Clans I&#x27;ve received ads for luxury watches and high end cars more likely than not because due to the income inequality in said countries if you are accessing content from a high end device you aren&#x27;t just middle class you are very wealthy as many of those countries don&#x27;t really have a traditional middle class (China has one now and it&#x27;s one of the biggest consumer of luxury goods in the world).<p>The Ad market is complicated, I wouldn&#x27;t just go around sticking prices to users from different countries because it&#x27;s much harder to estimate that, logic that works in western developed nations quite often fails everywhere else.",1453427699

Most trojans/backdoors persist because they&#x27;re able to modify the underlying OS to load them on boot. No, immutable OSes are -- by no means -- a new idea. This just uses the approach by default.<p>Not talking about the kernel specifically. Although there&#x27;s no reason the bootup time should be slowed down by loading unnecessary HAL, drivers, protocols, utilities that will never be used in a server setup. GBs of modules was referring to the rest of the OS made up mostly of features that will never be used by the server.<p>Crypto support is one big issue. I&#x27;d assume if the OS uses V8 at the base level, it should be able to be packaged with OpenSSL.<p>Auditing for what exactly? File access? The filesystem is immutable. Network requests? Can ve handles at the network level or a tool can be added to log network requests via an offline logging service.<p>Security auditing at the OS level isn&#x27;t required to the same degree it is on other OSes because the attack surface is so small. For instance, you don&#x27;t have to check for SSH vulnerabilities when there&#x27;s no SSH. The userspace sandbox isn&#x27;t necessary because everything that&#x27;s network-facing already has to run through V8&#x27;s sandbox.<p>Application-level vulnerabilities will always be an issue but that&#x27;s nothing new.

With Gallilean relativity if you were traveling at 0.5c then the speed of light in front of you would be 0.5c and behind you would be 1.5c.  This wouldn&#x27;t just affect tabletop physics experiments but would change everything about atomic and molecular physics which is all just applied electrodynamics.<p>That means your biology would fail in odd ways due to chemical reactions in your body changing if you were traveling fast.<p>SR is just Einstein working backwards from wanting to keep the equations of E+M invariant to however fast you were traveling.<p>As a result, the speed of light needs to be constant in all reference frames.  That means if you are traveling at 0.5c you measure the speed of light to still just be c.<p>All of SR basically falls out of that, including implying that c is s &#x27;speed limit&#x27;.  Although I guess to be technical that&#x27;s also built on principles like conservation of energy and momentum, but you can get those from Noether&#x27;s theory and space and time translational symmetries.<p>There might be a deeper more naval-gazing philosophical question here as to &#x27;why&#x27; we find ourselves in a universe that has physical laws that work the same in highly boosted reference frames.  It actually does us a favor as far as space travel and interplanetary travel goes since otherwise we&#x27;d be forever limited to traveling at substantial fractions of the speed of light to other star systems (to keep our biology from failing).<p>The local relativity of physical laws is also critical to extend the theory to General Relativity and express Gravity as the curvature of space-time.  Without SR, then the theoretical basis of GR will necessarily fall apart.<p>There&#x27;s no a priori reason why the Universe could not have had Galilean relativity, though, but gravity couldn&#x27;t work the same way and physics in boosted reference frames would be very weird.  There might be some perverse cosmological result of taking Galilean relativity to its extreme, but I wouldn&#x27;t know what that was.",1453426929

10949987,comment,10940455,10940455,0,0,dnautics,,,"An alternative narrative.  This is classical economic group behavior near the top of a bubble.  The fed has long goosed its lending programs with cheap money, in an effort to stimulate investment, and to avoid the spectre of spiraling deflation that they were worried would happen after the short deflation of 2009.  Capitalists have then, rationally gone out in search of investments to yield a return.  However, innovation is a limited resource at any given time, and we&#x27;re close to tapping out on the amount of possible innovation.  Moreover, realizing the full capacity of innovation is limited by the structure of society, wherein identifying entrepreneurs with actual potential is overtaken by identifying artificial &#x27;signals&#x27; or &#x27;tropes&#x27; of entrepreneurs: lots of false positives, charlatans, people with connections, or people who just got lucky once, are getting money, yields are decreasing.<p>Accordingly, as capitalists identify that it is becoming difficult to find real investments, their investment behavior decreases, just as the Fed is starting to pay banks to hold cash, to shore up reserves and make banks appear more resilient in the face of their &quot;stress tests&quot;.  This is artifical disinflation, but the worst type, because normally deflation helps the poor, but by the very mechanism of the current disinflation, it&#x27;s going to the top.  (Austrians:  Why is giving money out disinflation?  Because in this case it&#x27;s tied to <i>not lending</i>, and private lending-based monetary expansion has a multiplier effect).<p>What to expect down the line:<p>A minor economic crisis as happens occasionally (black swans) will start triggering capitalists to start spending their cash reserves.  As this spending hits the market, prices will go up, triggering inflation measures to start accurately reflecting the pent up monetary expansion that the Fed has undergone over the past 8 or so years.  As the price of goods goes up, it will no longer make sense to hold onto cash, and moreover, the smart move will be to start investing in goods producers that can take advantage of these increasing prices.<p>We&#x27;ll have an inflationary spiral spanning say 2016-2018.  Don&#x27;t worry, it won&#x27;t be a Wiemar-republic level crisis, but it certainly will not be pleasant for the poorest Americans.<p>I probably have some details about the macroeconomics wrong, so we shall see whether my prediction comes true.

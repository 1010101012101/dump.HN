No thank you. There should be a pill, or a suction hose. This would be a trillion dollar market.<p>4) I have hopes for augmented reality dating. It would just be awesome to have that much extra knowledge .. Imagine you're about to hit on some beautiful redhead in a ""Science, it works bitches"" shirt when you do a facial recognition and find out through OKCupid that she's a strong christian and a member of the jonesboro baptist church, whereas you're looking for a kinky atheist .. Crisis avoided!<p>5) I spoke with the TV-B-Gone guys about this a while back. They gave it some thought and found that the car-stereo options were just too varied to be feasible .. I guess every  souped up car stereo with remotes uses a different tech, often proprietary. Still, it would be nice.. I'd also accept a directional EMP gun.<p>6) oooh!<p>7) Definitely neat .. That being said, as a pedestrian, I don't trust my local consumers to drive a car, maybe a computer could do a better job.<p>8) That's kind of neat.. I have a rather specific application for video chat. My daughter lives in Seattle, and we use Google Video to chat right now .. It's pretty sub-par. 900 miles as the bird flies should be enough for us to have at least 1024x768 chat with minimal latency .. This is actually a startup I'm thinking about pursuing, but one specifically towards making it so divorced dads can chat with their toddlers without their toddlers having the ability to accidentally close the window ..

1103123,comment,1101693,1102115,0,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"First off, thanks for taking this well. It was a bit of a rant, even if it was toned down from the first version. Sorry.<p>We agree SMTP will be around forever; but how do you plan on abolishing MIME then? Your system will have to handle it, no matter what. Do you want to push MIME handling to the server? IMAP already does that, there's nothing revolutionary about that.<p>Due to the special structure, it's usually possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other 8-bit text. The tricky part is what to do with unmarked non-UTF-8 8-bit text - it could be pretty much anything. Mutt, for instance, allows the user to configure this according to what the user expects to see. Quoting the manual,<p><pre><code>    For example, Japanese users might prefer this:\n    set assumed_charset=""iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8""\n</code></pre>\nThere is a lot more information about such things on the Mutt site. Basically, Mutt tries to parse the headers/message according to a specific character set and falls back to the next one if that fails.<p>I probably wouldn't trust my e-mail to a protocol that was only a few years old. I don't anticipate any new security protocols with significant uptake either; ""serious"" stuff already uses SSL/TLS plus an authentication method (passwords/certificates/SASL), and the web crowd is unlikely to replace that (OAuth is about weakening security in a controlled way, not replacing SSL.)<p>And yeah, parts of IMAP are clunky. But that's not enough reason to rip-and-replace it.",1265360330

1103115,comment,1102756,1102849,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Many tech companies succeed by maximizing their highs, making the most of their successes. This takes a substantial amount of risk, especially in the tech industry, but it's a very sensible business model that applies across several industries. Microsoft is unusual in that its pattern for success is not in maximizing highs (few MS products are considered best in class, let alone examples of exemplary execution and design) but rather in turning around and avoiding failures.<p>MS was headed for a crisis in the early 90s because their 16-bit consumer OS (Win 3.1/DOS) was a technological dead-end while their 32-bit next gen OS (Win NT) was not suitable for consumers due to excessive hardware requirements (namely a 4mb per process overhead for every 16-bit app, or a $150 premium for each 16-bit app running simultaneously). Instead, MS pursued an unusual hybrid approach (windows 95) that allowed a significant amount of the benefits of a 32-bit pre-emptive multi-tasking OS with more reasonable hardware requirements than OS/2 or NT. A solution that lasted another 6 years before finally being supplanted by their fully 32-bit Windows XP consumer OS. Similarly, MS recovered from the underwhelming Vista release with Windows 7. They turned around their shameful Live search efforts with Bing. They avoided disaster with the v1 XBOX, which was a reasonably popular system but a serious financial debacle, by halting production and putting out the XBOX 360, resulting in runaway popularity <i>and</i> financial success.<p>This ability to make such dramatic saving rolls against failure is a defining characteristic for MS. There are a few other tech companies that have shown some degree of this capability (Intel and Apple, for example) but it is far more characteristic of MS (and far more responsible for their success). In an industry with a rich history of fast rising superstars that later flare out in catastrophic failure (Sun, Excite, geocities, myspace, Digital Research, Netscape, DEC, countless more) MS's three decade history of turning potential catastrophes into successes is at the core of what makes the company tick. It may not be as glamorous as other companies who reach Olympian heights of excellence, trail-blaze new markets, or revolutionize old ones but it's been an enormously successful strategy for MS.<p>Perhaps MS has lost the mojo and the guts to make these sorts of major saving moves any more (from my time at MS I fear this may be becoming true). Perhaps this sort of strategy is no longer relevant in an era of even faster technological change. Only time will tell.",1265359934

Now here's what is cool:<p>- Domestic Robots (I just spent 3 hours doing 2 weeks worth of laundry. Automation please)<p>- Flying cars<p>- Efficient weight loss technology (if we can put a man on the moon and split up twins, why can't we just put a hose in my stomach and make it so that I can buy clothes off the shelf?)<p>- Accelerated learning<p>- Augmented reality .. for dating. Wouldn't it be great to walk into a club with a pair of glasses that double as a HUD and tell you a girl's OKCupid profile name, what her favorite band is, and what personality flags are set? Or even better, glasses that double as a HUD and can use AdBlockPro HUD Version in order to block out billboards and<p>- TV Killer for car stereos. I'd happily buy a keyfob that turns off the stereo of some kid parked below my window with 3x JL Audio 10"" speakers wired up to 0 ohms playing the latest souljaboy hit at 160 bass-thumping decibles .. at 3am when I'm trying to sleep.<p>- Embedded GPS tracking chips so I never have to worry about becoming a stealth commando to get my daughter back after she's been kidnapped by russian slave traders.<p>- Self-driving cars .. I really, really hate driving, but even in San Francisco, public transportation sucks.<p>- Video conference that doesn't suck but doesn't require paying $200k to Cisco for the tech?<p>- 3D, immersive VR (whatever happened to the VR buzzword? I know it's sooo 1998) video games that hide reality for a while and make gaming fun again!<p>Seriously, someone must be doing something fun? The last two truly exciting technologies I've heard of were Dean Kamen's robotic arms, and FusionIO's storage devices .. And that's about it since Web 2.0 became a buzzword.",1265357713

About 2 years ago I lived with a college senior who didn't know what the ""My Documents"" folder is, where their downloaded files went or that they could put things in different places.

He claims that it's self-destructive for Western nations to pressure the Chinese government on issues such as human rights or pollution, but without such pressure, the results will be much more destructive for the Chinese citizens marginalized by their government.<p>Allowing the PRC to get away with their ""but we're still a developing nation"" cop-out every time the pressure is on to do the Right Thing is setting ourselves up for much bigger problems later on. If China wants to work with us, trade with us, and be regarded as a modern nation, it needs some help, yes, and some peer pressure along with it. We're a global community and we have some expectations - ones unsurprisingly not met by the ""enemies"" listed in Gilder's article.<p>We are, in fact, attempting to guide China towards a particular path so that it DOESN'T become an enemy later on.

To that end, I think identifying clear steps, as opposed to a strictly ideological argument, is a good way to convince the overwhelming majority that the change is necessary and good.<p>But of all those examples, the War on Drugs is probably the easiest to ""just stop,"" so to speak. Putting an end to Social Security overnight means that grandparents around the country won't have any source of income. That's a good example of where just ending a program overnight seems impractical to me.<p>To address your previous point, I have spent some time on Mises before, not as much Cato. But not enough time on either to really comment about specifics on their proposals or lack thereof. I suspect the reasoning you presented is probably accurate, at least in some part.",1265357382

This falls a lot in line with selling on benefits and not features.

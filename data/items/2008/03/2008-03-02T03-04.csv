I don't think there are very many people in SV who get so much personal (read: not a funding proposal) email that they can't keep up with it.  Unknowns don't need news.yc in order to talk to PG, and anyone who sees that as the site's primary application is abusing it.   My IMAP server contains a pile of email exchanges with him from long before the site existed.",1204430177
127124,comment,126981,127115,0,0,NSX2,,,"Well, I just went to the link you provided and aside from 90% of the ideas being well-intentioned but half-baked, I can't help but notice there are no business ideas.  So, to answer your question, no, there aren't.  Why would anybody waste time documenting an idea they don't have the inclination to implement?  Why don't they have the inclination?  Because there's no motivation.  Why?  Because they realize they can't make money off of it.  Hence the only ideas you'll find for ""free"" on the internet are ideas nobody can figure out how to make any money off of.  If they <i>could</i> figure that out, then they would have the inclination and thus, logic indicates that they'd MAKE the time.  And keep the idea to themselves, not post it up for all to see and profit off of.",1204429817

It can be viewed as a generalization of Hacker News.",,"This is actually a more general idea for contacting anyone well known who would probably just ignore your email because you are not near him/her in his/her social network.<p>You can think of Hacker News as an example of this idea since it allows unknowns to contact PG -- particularly if their submission is voted up to the front page.<p>More generally, what about using a social news site specifically built for this purpose (and not just for contacting the people who created the site)?<p>The idea is that if many people agree that you have something interesting to say to someone famous, then he/she would probably be interested in hearing what you have to say.<p>Moreover, a famous person is more likely to respond to a question if he/she feels the response would be of interest to many people.",1204429431

127114,comment,126981,127105,0,0,NSX2,,,"Exactly. And it doesn't even have to be ""economic worth"" it could be a time/money saving solution that let's some one devote an extra 1 hour to playing with their kids.  That's a worthy cause as any.  You won't get published in any journal, but I suspect the feedback would be worth it in its own way.  I just think there needs to be more of a balance.  Google can afford to bankroll people working on problems for their own sake because they got the ""value-added"" part down pretty well first, for example.  No shame in having your feet on the ground while your head looks upward (IMHO).",1204428631

The poster above said that Yahoo wasn't an interesting technical challenge, just a useful approach to a common problem.  Then I just acknowledged that.  The ""argument"" is either based on a misunderstading of the 2 posts or a projection of your own self-debating thinking process.",1204428326

I can't stand lawyers and I can't stand psychiatrists and I don't care enough about neurologists and neuro-scientists to figure out what the difference is.<p>And yet over the last 10 years, the mixing of people of these seemingly unrelated backgrounds has given the world 2 of the most useful applications of economics: Law & Economics and Neuro-Economics.  Fascinating and practical.  Who knew?<p>Why can't all fields be like that, faster?<p>That's why ultimately I can't respect the programming ethos, as I've seen it, too much.  Any true professional ... or academic ""seeker of knowledge"" ... should, IMHO seek continous improvement - bot vertical in terms of skill in their own field AND horizontal in terms of different perspectives.<p>Why does everyone respect Da Vinci so much, but nobody seems to want to emulate his methods?",1204428087

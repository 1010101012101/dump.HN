6552529,comment,6552224,6552414,2,0,christoph,,,"Personally, I don&#x27;t view Supercell in the same way/league as Zynga at all. Firstly, Zynga went crazy releasing a massive number of titles really quickly and not focusing on core products. Supercell have 2 games out... yes, 2! They put a huge amount of focus into both those games and don&#x27;t appear to be in any rush to dilute them whatsoever.<p>Also, Zynga were considered scummy for a variety of reasons - theft of others ideas (read blatantly stealing entire games from competitors) and their way over the top insistence on pollution of social networks. I don&#x27;t see this behavior with Supercell at all.",1381834758

6552513,comment,6545132,6552365,1,0,chad_oliver,,,"Let me respond to your final paragraph first. I actually don&#x27;t agree with the idea that people should &quot;act more responsibly&quot; and &quot;choose&quot; to get educated. Or rather, I think they are never given the choice. Children working are forced to do so by the poverty of the parent, who were in turn forced into their life path by poverty. Of course this is not always the case, but what I have seen indicates that economic poverty is primarily due to a poverty of <i>choices</i>. Economic poverty flows from that.<p>That said, I stand by my belief that the free market is an effective way (and perhaps the <i>most</i> effective way) to lift people out of poverty. It&#x27;s cruel, slow, and painful, but it also produces long-term improvements at a scale that mere charity cannot match. I think targeted aid is great, and I expect that it would be far more effective on a per-dollar basis, but cheap labor has a greater impact simply because the world economy throws a lot of money at it.<p>I disagree with your assessment that &quot;buying cheap clothes almost directly contributes to the continuation of poverty&quot; (However, see my caveat below). I just had a chat about this with my flatmate, who is an economist and has a much better grasp of the topic than I. He pointed out that, historically, sweatshops are only the first stage of economic development. Sweatshops provide a better (but still bad) income to unskilled laborers, which gives them enough free income to invest in their own human capital. Greater human capital attracts other investors, and the country pulls itself up by the bootstraps. South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have built developed economies by starting with sweatshops. China is in the process of doing this. In contrast, India has more restrictions against foreign investment and sweatshops, and their economic growth has lagged behind countries with less restrictive laws.<p>Or, to put it more simply: sweatshops are an important stage on the road to a developed economy, because initially cheap labor is the only thing that an undeveloped country can offer to investors. If you don&#x27;t allow sweatshops, you don&#x27;t get any investment, and the development process stops before it truly started. There&#x27;s a lot of inefficiencies, and a lot of greedy people (including us as consumers) taking bites out of the pie, but it works better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.<p>As I mentioned above, my position is tempered by an important caveat. You point out that some countries have an ethical supply chain. I initially discarded this based on the assumption that &#x27;ethical&#x27; usually just means &#x27;first world&#x27;, but I realize now that you are correct. I haven&#x27;t yet come across a garment manufacturer with a truly ethical supply chain, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist. I will make it a priority to search out such a supplier, and provide them with my patronage. If you have any suggestions, I would be happy to hear them.",1381834369

This suggests to me that it has very little signal for this discussion, since it evinces absolutely no knowledge of either of the companies at issue or any attempt to rectify that.<p>For example: will Softbank require a $1.2 billion bank loan to make this purchase?  That&#x27;s possible (they do 100% of their borrowing in a country where money is, essentially, free for the asking) but unlikely, because they&#x27;re sitting on over $14 billion in cash and cash equivalents and they hold the vast majority of it in a country where, as mentioned, money is free for the asking.<p>See page 106 in their annual report, or some other page at some other link if you would prefer the English version:<p><a href=""http://www.softbank.co.jp/ja/design_set/data/irinfo/library/annual_reports/pdf/2013/softbank_annual_report_2013_008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softbank.co.jp/ja/design_set/data/irinfo/library/...</a><p>If for some reason they wanted to borrow money, they&#x27;d probably finance with bonds, not bank loans.

I think you underestimate just how expensive college has become, especially in states that don&#x27;t value educating smart people. I graduated into a recession, and even finding enough work to pay rent was incredibly difficult, because I was competing for minimum wage jobs against people with college degrees. The area was and is incredibly economically depressed.<p>I also had health problems that went untreated as a kid that made it hard to work. No college also meant no healthcare.

This would mean that early investors would start with a large controlling stake, but it would diminish over time as the effects of the time people spent working at the company started to kick in.<p>I await the rubbishing of my ideas with moderately bated breath! ;-)",1381832540

6552408,comment,6551715,6551715,3,0,CookWithMe,,,"2 years ago, in my last semester at the university, I volunteered at doing an intro-course for first-semester computer science students. Basically, we made sure they transitioned to the university learning style and they&#x27;ve got some student instead of a prof to talk to. Each student had to prepare a talk on a relevant topic.<p>One of the things we talked about was career options. Imo, first you want to do a broad search, and then you want to dive into specific careers. I.e. a computer science student could get into software development, system administration or consulting. If development sounds most interesting, she should learn about the differences between several technical areas (frontend/backend) as well as company types (software shop/IT dep in larger corp/agency).<p>One of the students picked up a book on career options for computer science students and did a 30 min talk. I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the book and shortening it to 30 min didn&#x27;t really help, but oh well. But it definitely broadened the horizon of most students. They either didn&#x27;t have any clear picture of a job, or they knew one or two types of jobs because someone in their social circle happened to have that particular job.<p>If I had given my student(s) your MVP, it would have most likely failed. With 3 random jobs displayed, it&#x27;s not broad enough to lay out different career options. Plus, job ads, especially for software developers, teach you as much about being a software developer as a car commercial teaches you about driving a car.<p>To finding &quot;a better career&quot;, I&#x27;d still recommend my students a book that tries to list most major career options, and tries to objectively name (dis-)advantages of each job. Job ads, no matter how well done, are a terrible first place to start the search.<p>That said, I think you&#x27;ve found a problem that currently isn&#x27;t solved very well and I&#x27;d look forward to the next iteration of your MVP.",1381831831

One of these things is the sneaking suspicion that we are in danger of losing track of how to do things at the most fundamental levels. If you go back to 1970, for example, there were legions of programmers who could create the most wondrous software out of 8 bit assembler by hand. These days, by comparison, we have incredibly sophisticated compilers, editing environments and runtimes that can do a lot of the &quot;thinking&quot; and the code generation for us -- the downside is that it&#x27;s becoming almost impossible to find anyone who is capable of doing this sort of thing without having access to these tools and machines.<p>We are poised to lose the experience, history and other trivia that makes us what we are now if not preserved and is easily accessible.",1381831773

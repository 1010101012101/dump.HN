You get a glimpse of the reasoning in the last few lines, where he states that the ratio of corporate profits over GDP doubled, from 6% to 12% of GDP from pre-80s to nowadays.<p>We[1] have a problem with wealth distribution. I don&#x27;t draw this problem in terms of fairness, because the concept of fairness is different from an individual to the next. We have a problem of income distribution that goes beyond the notion of fairness, becoming serious enough to be a menace to the stability of capitalism.<p>A balanced economy has a thriving consumption component, which creates demand, and a thriving investment component, which drives supply. These go hand in hand. If there is too much demand, and investment falters, you get high inflation economies. However, if you get too much investment and demand falters, you suddenly have no investment opportunities and you get a slew of ill effects as capital is trying to find out where it can get returns. The most visible such effect is the appearance of investment bubbles and the crashes when these burst.<p>People easily recognize the problems of investment-starved economies. The common citizen does not recognize the problems of demand-starved economies, because these are new.<p>Here, we can witness first hand how young economic science is. Inflationary effects on supply starved economies were the norm in the XX century, so these are very well studied. Demand starved economies? Not so much. The US and the EU are the first ones (possibly, in a slightly different fashion, preceded by Japan).<p>The causes for this do not lay squarely on politicians. It&#x27;s easy to take a passionate view and find a target to blame. That is not the case, however.<p>The current demand starved economy is caused by a big mix of factors. I&#x27;ve never ran the numbers, so take my opinion with a grain of salt: I&#x27;d wager the two biggest factors are:<p>1. Technological evolution, which increases demand while causing a deflation of costs (and consequently, on the circulation speed of money)<p>2. Globalization. We have moved a great deal of added value to developing countries, namely in the East. If Japan can be used as an example of what to expect, it will take two generations for demand to occur there.<p>The globalization question is specially problematic. Not because there aren&#x27;t enough resources for everyone. It is problematic because China is huge. The delay in consumption increase, coupled with huge inertia, can destroy western economies.<p>The technological question is important, but it has been with us ever since the industrial revolution. We have been able to cope with it, and the same methods should apply.<p>[1] I&#x27;m European. We are, however, in the same boat as North Americans in this problem, with slightly worse politicians. Europe is politically led by Germany. Historically, Germany is prone to fear investment starved economies so they are profoundly erring on identifying the issues and correctly acting).",1420300768

In my long time of adblock-free browsing I&#x27;ve noticed an interesting correlation - the more ads there are on a page and the crappier they get, the less trustworthy and useful the site itself is. Moreover, heavily advertised products tend to be crap designed to extract money from you by luring you into a suboptimal choice. Ads are a good proxy for both crappiness of the product and of the site that shows them. From what I see, if AdBlock kills anything, it kills sites that have no business being on the Internet in the first place, because they waste people&#x27;s time.",1420300705

In my previous job as a programmer (video game development) we were given more work than was possible in the usual working hours.  So we had to do work additional hours (unpaid) to catchup - which was pretty much constant throughout a project.  This meant my employer was getting work done for free.<p>Honestly the additional hours nearly made me quit full-time employment.

8830938,comment,8830609,8830609,0,0,briandear,,,"Are the workers powerless in this? I am not debating the premise, but it&#x27;s a fair question. Wages are generally driven by market conditions (except in Union jobs, but that&#x27;s another discussion..) so I wonder if the similar competition for wages ought not include hours worked. A 40 hour job paying 50k would be preferable to a 60 hour job paying 60k, yet most job seekers simply look at the salary and not the cost. It would seem that wage competition should naturally extend to hours competition. I see this in some startups.. They might offer you $125k yet imply an 80 hour week is expected. So that salary is dramatically lower than a 100k position at 40 hours. Yet that differential is rarely discussed. I think a mandatory, government imposed rule ultimately distorts the market. What if someone is willing to work extra hours as a part of their salary? I&#x27;m not sure the government &#x27;protecting&#x27; us can actually be quantified so clearly. If an average position pays $55k and requires 55 hours, then with new overtime rules, there&#x27;s nothing preventing that salary to become $40k. My point is that business will always optimize -- a business will never pay more than the value of the input. What would likely happen is either increased hiring of no benefits part timers or an increase in the product price which would then drive inflation. There&#x27;s some serious unintended consequences that the original author seems to gloss over. I am not sure who this guy is but unless he&#x27;s paying his workers overtime, then I don&#x27;t much care what he has to say. If he&#x27;s a &quot;wealthy&quot; entrepreneur who doesn&#x27;t like the rules, he&#x27;s free to pay his workers more. He&#x27;s also making the suggestion that &quot;corporate&quot; profits have grown-- which corporations? All of them? The majority of businesses are small businesses -- what effect would these rules have on them?<p>I am not dismissing the premise, just suggesting that there is far more complexity and shades of gray involved.",1420299054

The author describes himself as an &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; but I haven&#x27;t yet found some detailed sources about how his business ventures were formed or funded. I have found some strong criticism of his basic understanding of economics.<p>As for the law on the topic, the author may be correct that the President acting alone can use executive authority under established law to let the income threshold for mandatory overtime pay rise. I haven&#x27;t checked whether or not that is entirely in the hands of the President under current United States law. If so, then the only politics around the issue would be the politics of what an incumbent President already in the second half of his second term (a &quot;lame duck&quot; President) thinks is an appropriate response to this issue among all the other issues he is dealing with.<p>What I don&#x27;t know here for sure is how much any of this would matter economically to most people. Neither my wife nor I are employees of anyone (we both work as sole-proprietor business owners). We can work as many hours as we can stay awake without gaining overtime pay. What I hear about more often in the United States economy than employed wage-earners not being paid overtime is employed wage-earners not being offered even full-time hours, because shorter hours remove a requirement to provide employee health insurance benefits for many employers. I&#x27;m not at all sure what the author advocates here would have a big beneficial effect for the economy in general or for workers now working overtime in particular. Demand for labor working under any particular schedule is elastic, and maybe the proposal here will just result in fewer working hours being offered per employee.",1420299020

Will my UTF16 <-> UTF8 conversion roundtrip my malformed UTF16 codepoints?  If not, I&#x27;ve just lost compatibility with (admittedly buggy) software.  But I&#x27;ve seen bugs from far tamer, such as from the simple act of converting from a fixed width wchar_t[] that was observed to be a NUL terminated UTF16 string to std::wstring.  It turned out that under certain circumstances that couldn&#x27;t be tested, it was an opaque binary blob with NULs in the middle... and the bit after the NULs being important.  Whoops!<p>Less relevant here though:  std::experimental::filesystem::v1::path::value_type looks to match the native OS character type.
But then again, is that unichar (16-bit) or wchar_t (32-bit) on iOS?  Fufufufu~<p>It&#x27;s also just plain <i>easier</i> when you&#x27;re dealing with native filesystem APIs for whatever reason to work in the native character type, which is the main reason I&#x27;d prefer it.<p>> but I have a hard time believing that this conversion would matter (or even be measurable) relative to the time the actual I/O will take.<p>RE: Performance: If you&#x27;re doing actual I/O, agreed.  If you&#x27;re dealing with OS or application cached filesystem entries, it becomes more believable.  If you&#x27;re enumerating over and only conditionally performing I/O over hundreds of thousands of paths - you&#x27;ll want to be quite cautious of conversions if you care about performance (potentially see: directory enumeration via backups, stale file scans during builds, or comparing file lists between VCS revisions...)  It drives me absolutely insane when a &#x27;nothing changed&#x27; build takes 10, 20 seconds just from filesystem scanning.  And I&#x27;ve seen and fixed far worse (think O(n*n) scans -_-;;).  As others have noted though, if you keep your conversions &#x27;reasonable&#x27; you should be able to get away with UTF8 paths from a performance perspective.<p>> Filesystem is a great addition to the C++ standard library.<p>Agreed.",1420298795

8830892,comment,8827600,8828883,0,0,jules,,,"In order for that to be a testable prediction the terms need to be made precise. OO is a famously vague concept with many different concrete incarnations. There&#x27;s single dispach vs multiple dispatch. Within single dispatch you have prototype based vs class based. You have objects as a record of closures. With multiple dispatch you have dispatch on class, or predicate dispatch, or full pattern matching. There&#x27;s the question whether some form of identity or state is part of OO. The concept is broad enough that you can easily stretch it so that almost any modern language is OO in some form. A functional  or logic programming language where functions can be split into multiple cases with pattern matching is arguably just a generalization of predicate dispatch.<p>If on the other hand we restrict the term to languages where values are essentially identity + a record of methods (whether through the indirection of a class v-table or directly stored in the value as in prototype based languages), I do think that model has largely run its course. It will certainly remain popular in the near future, but people are increasingly realizing that modeling everything as a record of methods + identity (+ state?) isn&#x27;t a good way to do it. There are certain things that lend themselves to that way of modeling, but most things are best modeled in some other way. Records of functions + identity is just one particular data type among many, and it&#x27;s not any more special than any other data type. Modeling everything as an object is like TCL where you model everything as a string. OOP is nice on the surface because you have some vague analogy to real world objects, but that does more harm than good. It is similar to agile or TDD where people try to sit down at the computer and immediately start typing code without any careful thinking beforehand. Like TDD and agile, OO also facilitates that kind of programming because people can take the concepts in their head and immediately start typing class definitions. It works for easy problems, but even there it does not lead to a pretty end result (one of the symptoms that sticks out most is the question &#x27;on which class does this method belong?&#x27;). Rather than designing your program to model the real world, it usually works much better to design your program around the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve. Rather than starting with the real world and making an analogue to it in your program, you start with the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve and come up with a data model that facilitates solving that problem. A famous example of the former style gone wrong is Ron Jeffries who tried to write a sudoku solver with an OO + TDD approach in a series of blog posts. He modeled his program with classes that seem natural for the problem, and he wrote tests for those. Unfortunately writing a sudoku solver is not one of those problems where you can just start banging out code without any thought and get it to work, so he got stuck because he did not think about how to actually solve the problem, he only thought about how to model the real world with OO.",1420297948

For example: &quot;If everyone uses AdBlock to prevent sleazy ads that can contain malware, then those ads will no longer have value, and they will cease to exist.&quot; If you think of AdBlock as a vaccine, then by the categorical imperative, it&#x27;s necessary to vaccinate everyone[0].<p>Or, &quot;If everyone uses AdBlock, then websites will have to invent monetization tactics that don&#x27;t involve auctioning off its user&#x27;s eyeballs and privacy&quot;.

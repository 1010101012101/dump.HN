This is exactly what customers pay our company to avoid.<p>Because, in fact, the ""continuous"" model is a poor fit for software ecosystems unless your time scale is sufficiently long. If you don't care about downtime as measured in hours or days, go ahead and sync up every day. But if you care about downtime as measured in <i>minutes</i> or <i>seconds</i>, the continuous model isn't good enough, because at that scale software doesn't evolve continuously at all. It lurches ahead in sudden jolts, and each component lurches ahead on its own timescale, and only when you stand way back does the process look continuous.<p>The other problem with the ""continuous"" model is bugs. Software only lurches ahead on <i>average</i>; in practice any given patch is as likely to move you <i>backwards</i> as forwards. Three steps forward, two steps back. If I could be assured that every change in the Linux kernel was permanent and perfect, it might be worthwhile to run my websites off the latest kernel source HEAD, sync up every day, and fix bugs as they arrived. But in the real world, if someone commits a bug to the kernel source tree on Monday, and it breaks my site, so I work around the bug, and then someone fixes the bug in the kernel on Friday, and then I roll back my workarounds, I have just wasted hours of my life that I will never see again. I have churned my code for no net gain.<p>(Of course, you may ask: Why didn't I just fix the kernel bug on Monday instead of working around it in my site's code? Well, the Linux universe is too complicated for any of us to hold all of it in our heads: I can't fix kernel bugs, at least not on a timescale of days. So ""this isn't the Apple II anymore; the universe is too big to patch the whole thing at once"" is yet another reason why the continuous model doesn't work.)<p>It's just not that simple.",1305643883

2556394,comment,2555562,2555562,3,0,tspiteri,,,"The article, and quite a few posts here, describe the way they understand the Fourier Transform as the way to understand the Fourier Transform. For it to be intuitive depends on who is trying to understand it. Getting that out of the way, this is how I find the Fourier Transform intuitive (using pseudo-code instead of math notation to make it a bit verbose and emphasize the steps):<p><pre><code>    fourier_trasform(signal sig(t), frequency freq):
        let sinu(t) = sinusoid with frequency freq
        let mult(t) = sig(t) * sinu(t)
        value = integral of mult(t) from -infinity to infinity
</code></pre>
If the input signal sig(t) has the same frequency as the sinusoid sinu(t), then integrating mult(t) over infinity will give an infinitely large value, and that case is handled better by the Fourier Series.<p>If the input signal sig(t) has no relation to the frequency of the sinusoid, then integrating mult(t) over infinity will give zero.<p>If the signal has a component with the required frequency, it will kind of resonate with the sinusoid and give a non-zero value. The value then depends on the magnitude of the signal and to how much it ""resonates"" with the sinusoid.<p>When you do this for a range of different frequencies freq, but using the same signal sig(t), you can plot how much the signal sig(t) resonates with all frequencies, and that plot is the plot of the Fourier Transform.",1305641284

But I have seen reports that the payments don't all go one way --- that, for instance, carriers get some share of Android Market purchases made on their networks.<p>As to whether Amazon would want to meet Google's requirements, that's a business decision on their part.  Barnes and Noble hasn't for the Nook, at least so far --- but that's in part based around a strategy of marketing the Nook entirely as a niche device (a Kindle work-alike with a better web browser).

The idea is simple, you have all these people you are friends with or connected to, you dont discuss the same things with all of them, so by grouping them, you can say what you want to say to each group. I firmly believe that in the next year or two, rather than paying $0.25 (or whatever you pay) for a text message over phones, youll be texting over this app across your social network using peoples usernames.<p>Anyway, I wrote a post on here and it somehow found its way to the front-page. It only stayed there for 2 hours but it spent another 2 hrs on the 2nd and 3rd pages. I tracked the signups that came in on that day, and in 4 hours, there were 1536 new sign-ups from HN (directly and indirectly). Directly in the sense that they clicked on from here and signed up, and indirectly if the person signed up having been invited by someone who signed up from HN in that time. Of that number, 61% are active have have returned to the site more than 3 times and have created groups and 80% have invited people to their groups.<p>To any new apps/startups launching, HN is a great place to get that initial traction and the best part about it  for me atleast  is the number of criticisms, advise and feedback I got. That was much more important to me than signups.<p>App url: http://wolfpacktal.es",1305640915

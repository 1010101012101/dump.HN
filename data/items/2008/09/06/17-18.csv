Careful with those car anologies - I have heard people make remarks like that about Volvos.",1220723344

It's not as noble as making a profit more actively, but for personal and casual sites advertisement is a good thing. And Google Ads tries to give readers ads that they actually will care about.",1220722300

Pretty much any scheme by which you exchange cash for a set of promised future cash payments is bound to be abused at some point. There is very little new here, except that this is another quasi-guaranteed asset.",1220722268

This was my first Canvas + JavaScript graph implementation and I must say that it's a pretty nice system to work with. While Canvas is strictly a painting tool, I'm considering writing a library on top of it that will give me some of the interactivity and animation tools that I miss from Flash. Canvas is positioned to seriously compete with Flash, I'd love to see more people using it.",1220722147

I have tried to find good arguments for getting a Mac over Ubuntu/Windows, but haven't really found any that hold water.  I mostly do documents, presentations, spreadsheets, research, internet browsing, light programming.<p>The differences between them appear to come down to personal preference than an overwhelming difference:\n-Security.  Mac and Linux have better security handling and less malware than Windows.  I use DeepFreeze, which can fight off even laughing kitty.\n-Survives accidents.  Maybe there's a slight difference here, due to the sturdier frame/case of Macbooks?\n-Performance.  I'm looking at response time, level of annoyance during daily use.  Vista is a bitch, but WinXP and Ubuntu seem great.  With similarly equipped laptops, Macbook seems on par or slower than WinXP, and much slower than Ubuntu.",1220720932

Today, they are certainly profitable, although probably not making as much money as they could be.

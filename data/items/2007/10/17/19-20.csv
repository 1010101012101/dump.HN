In whatever galaxy you happen to find yourself, you take the circumference of a circle, divide it by its diameter, measure closely enough, and uncover a miracle--another circle, drawn kilometers downstream of the decimal point. There would be richer messages farther in. It doesn't matter what you look like, or what you're made of, or where you come from. As long as you live in this universe, and have a modest talent for mathematics, sooner or later you'll find it. It's already here. It's inside everything. You don't have to leave your planet to find it. In the fabric of space and in the nature of matter, as in a great work of art, there is, written small, the artist's signature. Standing over humans, gods, and demons, there is an intelligence that antedates the universe.<p>The circle had closed.

Me and my cofounder had a pretty big argument over whether to incorporate or not this summer. However, in our case the heart of the debate was whether or not it was needed yet, not the cost.<p>If they are having trouble parting with $100 or so, I really think they should consider what they are getting involved in.

People are complicated, and sometimes they grow into things very quickly, or there was only one little thing missing. And it's possible you misunderstood his reasons for hesitation, or there was some other kind of miscommunication.<p>So, go talk to him again and explain your vision carefully and how much work it will be, and why $135 is trivial. It's worth a try. And if you can't agree, OK, then go find someone else, <i>with his blessing</i>, since he will see that he doesn't want to be part of your vision (at this time in his life).",1192648776

You still really want this.<p>There is some excellent feedback in this thread.  Let me add mine, which may be a little different.  I go through what you are experiencing all the time.  There are days when I can't stay awake at my terminal.  Sometimes I hit a road block and wonder how I'll ever get by.  I usually step away for a time, but here is my real secret...<p>Pick one little thing that needs to get done, no matter how small or unimportant it may seem.  If I'm really down, I pick some mundane task like refactoring 25 lines of code, manually updating 50 records, or even changing some naming conventions.  But not something big like solving a client-server architecture problem.  Hell, that's the reason I'm already down.  One other thing - the task must be in the heart of your project; cleaning off your desk or reading a journal don't count.  Then do the task.  Completely.  You'll feel a little better, I promise.  The next day, do it again, maybe with a slightly bigger task.  And again.  And again.  Who knows, you may be feeling a lot better before you know it.<p>I have no idea if my advice can help save your project, but I do know you still want to.

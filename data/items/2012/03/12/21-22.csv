3695838,comment,3694672,3695499,1,0,wtallis,,,"A good idea is worthless if nobody ever thinks it, and it's value to society increases as it is shared with more people. This is completely opposite from the economics of scarce goods: once a good idea has been discovered, the macroeconomic optimum strategy is to eliminate as much as possible barriers to spreading that idea, so that everyone can benefit. Hoarding information may let you increase the <i>price</i>, but it doesn't increase or protect the <i>value</i>. ""price=value"" isn't a definition; it is only true for scarce goods in a competitive market. Would the Pythagorean Theorem be more <i>valuable</i> if you had to pay a fee to use it?<p>And no, we're not just talking about entertainment here. It's impossible to objectively separate entertainment content from more ""important"" ideas like <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> or even geostationary orbits (popularized by a sci-fi author). It's also impossible to fully separate copyrights and patents, since they have the same legal foundation and purpose.",1331589544

I'm trying to imply that libertarianism is a sort of socialism that has a particular set of values that it finds important to preserve by force. It just simply defines a violation of those values as an initiation of force in order to claim that it is only taking a hard line on freedom of association, expression, and contract.<p>Virtually every modern society claims to support freedom of association, expression, and contract, until it violates the public order, when it transforms into a initiation of force by terrorists. It all depends on how you define the public order.<p>edit: to directly answer your question, I'm a guy who you've never met who breaks your car window, gets into your car, and drives away.

We got our first large order, much larger than we ever had before, and it exceeded our average daily balance in our bank account.  They froze the funds for 6 months since that's the potential chargeback period.  Meanwhile, we had to foot the bill on the material as we were a hardware company and had to float those funds for a while.  Our margins weren't so high that this was a simple matter for us.<p>We ended up switching to a merchant bank that was better for online transactions.  Cynergy ultimately released the funds as three different disbursements after we closed our account and decided to charge us account activity fees for those three months as well.

Despite me doing nothing wrong, and my customers being quite happy with what I was delivering to them, paypal decided to get involved and screw things up.<p>Attempting to resolve the issue with them resulted in an unending series of demands, many of which were asinine (e.g.: show the original manufacturer invoice for this used piece of clothing you sold on ebay, or show us a contract with the creator of the software you're selling proving you have the right to sell it-- I was the creator, and obviously, of course, a contract from me, signed by me would not be acceptable to them.)<p>I sent them endless amounts of documentation, but they demanded more, and they lost half of it.

For me, Ubuntu peaked at about 10.10 (or maybe 11.04)<p>Each time a new release comes out, I give Unity another try, but it just doesn't work for me. For a while I was just reverting back to Gnome, but now the default Gnome is Gnome 3 which is (purely my opinion) very much a regression in terms of UX from Gnome 2.<p>I know this is Linux, and I can install whatever I want, but I don't want to have to. When I was younger I was happy to spend hours (and days!) tweaking stuff to make it work just the way I wanted it to. With all the other time sinks that growing up entails, when I get the chance to sit down at my computer these days, I just want it to work. I don't want to have to invest time I don't have learning a new way to do the old thing when the old way was perfectly fine.  (Probably me just getting old and curmudgeonly I know!)<p>Due to computers getting older and being replaced etc, I can't even reasonably keep using Ubuntu 11.04 - my latest laptop will not work correctly under anything less than 11.10 without hours of manking around compiling and installing wireless and graphics card drivers. (I blame the laptop for this, not linux). Research before buying indicated this laptop was reasonably well supported under linux. After purchase I found this model of laptop used a number of different chipsets for wireless and the one I ended up with (ath9k) was poorly supported at that time.<p>So, after having linux as my sole computing environment since 1996 (and using Ubuntu as my main distro since Breezy Badger) I have just this month packed it in and bought a 13"" Macbook Air to use as my main computer. I'm still using Ubuntu 10.10 server edition at work, (virtual machine running under xen) for development and as a production server - but I can't see Canonical breaking the command line as bad as they did the desktop any time soon!<p>Ubuntu may be finally ready for the desktop for some people but definitely not for me.",1331588705

They were great people and I loved having them on my server. I wouldn't kick them or demand they pay in an instant. But they weren't paying players. They were casual players, friends and friends of friends.<p>This model forces all of your friends to pay, instead of just a few.<p>If I sent this server to my friends, and they found out they had to sign up to play (or only get 10 hours free a month), they likely wouldn't make my server their home.

Some of the clever ones will even do this using the valuation at the last fundraising event.  VCs will agree that startups are a risky investment, and they seek 10x return on their investment because most of their investments fail.  If you know that most investments fail, then you should really be compensated at a risk-adjusted amount of equity (ie: you should get waaay more equity at the current valuation than the discrepancy with the market rate to compensate you for the risk that the equity will be worth 0.)

I had a few friendly exchanges with some of my libertarian friends who argue that ""private property"" is sacred. While I do believe that in principle no other group of people should force individuals to give up their property, it is a principle that would be difficult to fully implement because of the simple fact that we live in a small planet with limited resources. The atmosphere is a communal property,so are the riches of the world's oceans. Suppose for example I am the shrewdest businessman on the planet and managed to own 70% of the world's grain output, in theory it is my property, should I be allowed to burn them all to ashes (assuming I figured out a way to burn it without polluting the atmosphere) since those are mine anyways? Capitalism brought the greatest explosion of wealth in human history because it ""chose"" those who can manage resources more effectively through the market system (instead of an appointed bureaucrat). Bill Gates will never consume $60B worth of grain and he can only wear 1 pair of shoes at a time. But because he took the chance countless millions benefited from his endeavor. I also don't mind wealthy people buying $5M diamond rings while ""millions live on $2 a day"", considering how many people were employed and paid to sell them that piece of rock with little practical use. But the ""illusion"" of absolute ownership is powerful enough for people to take chances. The trick now is trying to figure out when the rest of society can say to an individual that ""you cannot do that!"" when it comes to his property.

Much of the funding for Lisp at MIT came from DARPA (aka ARPA) in the context of enabling technology for modern software for the military. The MIT AI Lab projects in general were largely funded by DARPA. For some information about the later funding see this book: Strategic Computing, DARPA and the Quest for Machine Intelligence, 1983-1993 <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8794"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&#38...</a><p>When the research created the first usable prototypes of hardware (the Lisp Machines and other stuff) and software (expert systems, ...) DARPA wanted to commercialize it to create a market which then could serve their needs. So licenses of the Lisp Machine design were sold to LMI, Symbolics and later TI. DARPA financed also the users. Many machines were funded to be bought by university projects. Much of the early Lisp Machines were sold to the SDI project (strategic defense initiative, a pet child of Ronald Reagan in the cold war, the space deployed missile defense system).<p>Stallman's role in that scenario is relatively tiny. He worked on software and when some of the stuff he was using was about to be commercialized (in the above context), he protested against it. DARPA's mission was not to develop free Lisp software, but to develop battle management systems, logistics software, diagnosis software for complex military equipment, assistents/trainers for fighter pilots, missile guidance software, ...<p>Stallman fought for free software, but he was working in a government funded lab, where the funders (DARPA) had a very different mission. The 'hacker spirit' at the lab was more of an accident, attracting creative people to develop the next generation of software and hardware. For the military and other government agencies, with commercial spin offs.<p>As mentioned the SDI initiative was using this technology. But there were several others.

It's theoretically possible to make uncrackable DRM, which means someone will do it. It's just a matter of time finding an economically viable solution that won't annoy users excessively. There's demand for expensive information--expensive in the economic sense, in that making this information takes lots of work from lots of experts. People want the latest movies, TV, software, video games, music.<p>And then there's the ultimate DRM, PG's favorite thing to invest in: the webapp. What better way to make users pay then to demand they do all their work on a server <i>you</i> have, not their own computer? To demand users sign over their financial information to Mint, their private email to GMail? When they don't pay in money, they pay in loss of privacy. Sometimes they pay in both.<p>I want <i>free information</i>, free not in the GNU sense--though that's always an option--but free by the social norms of fair and legitimate use.

Either we will give up freedom to protect media distribution in an effort to subsidize the media industry, or the media industry will change.<p>Theaters in the US took in $10 billion[1] in 2011.  Theaters are hardly on their last leg.  If studios can't survive on 16 million in revenue (on average) we really shouldn't be modifying laws in the US and internationally at the cost of freedom to help those inefficient studios stay in business.<p>[1] <a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2011</a>",1331586291

I attempted that argument in an old HN thread[1], based on the distinction between conventions that arise 'naturally' from an emergent social context, such as traditional physical property, and those that require top-down design in the form of legislative action.  I think one could regard physical property as belonging to the former category and IP as belonging to the second.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2284636"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2284636</a>",1331586272

Building software? you can do that anywhere though, doesn't have to be in a start-up. I think people tend to be choosy these days: they want to work in a company that is young, hip, quirky office layout/design, get a lot of attention, and use cutting edge (sometime unproven) technology.<p>Don't forget that there are plenty people out there that build software on their free-time (i.e.: side projects).<p>I'm having a little bit difficulty to understand of what you can learn in a short amount of time that you can't outside start-up. If the start-up moves too fast, you're bound to cut some corner, you're bound not to use the best-practices, you're bound to ""hacked it up"". I think we all have been exposed with the Mythical Man-Month book that explains some of the properties of software.<p>And if it moves in an even faster speed, I'm not sure how you can learn so much more as you'll get tired and just go to sleep after work.<p>Yes, you can definitely learn a lot from failures, assuming you know what went wrong. Not a lot of people know what went wrong though. Some people would stick it to ""bad luck"" as oppose to ""we don't have enough skill to pull it off"".<p>There's some truth to the old wisdom of learning from failures, I'm not dismissing any of it. There's that difference between actually experiencing the failure and learning from other people's failure. Sometimes it instils discipline and better work ethic.",1331586236

What's in it for the rest of us?<p>Isn't it contradictory to want to copy what a content creator produces and then deny that the content itself has value?<p>Which is it, does the thing have value that makes others want to copy it so it's worth respecting that content as property of the creator, or is it valueless and there's no need to copy it in the first place?<p>You can't really have it both ways.  If the content is worth copying then it obviously has value so it's worth it for society to protect that value.  Not protecting that value means dis-incentivizing content creators.<p>What is that value?  Well, like with everything else, that's a negotiation between the buyer and the seller.  For mass-market products, that means that the seller sets a price and the buyer makes a purchase or no-purchase decision based upon the price and the perceived value of the thing being purchased.<p>Once again, we're talking mostly about entertainment content here.<p>In weighing the societal benefit of the content creator vs the pirate who wants to have a system that would deprive that content creator of any means of earning money from his work -- guess to which party society will probably always attach more value.<p>So as a person who funds creation of content that I enjoy, I have to ask you:  Why should my tax dollars fund your legal framework?",1331586096

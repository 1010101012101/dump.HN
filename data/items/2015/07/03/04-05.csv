But I&#x27;m skeptical that programming will become some sort of new literacy.  It seems to me that programming has narrower applicability than, say, high school math.  Still, most non-programmers seem to forget their high school math, and they get by just fine in careers where numeracy would be useful from time to time, but is just not essential.  No one considers them illiterate.",1435899546

9823588,comment,9823246,9823246,0,0,kls,,,"I compare it to the engineer of the industrial revolution and it will continue to be the same until there is a fundamental shift in the way we transfer instructions to computers. The biggest threat to the profession of software development is AI, when something can infer what a non-technical person means it will spell the end of the dedicated developer. Then much like the telegraph operator, the profession will disappear almost over night. That being said, a lot of professions will be gone just as quickly.<p>Until them I would like to offer some perspective from someone who has been in the industry for some time and to have seen the tail end of the home computing revolution, the birth of the web and all the iterations till modern day.<p>I had this discussion with a buddy that left software dev after the .com bust and the first wave of offshoring development jobs. He, having come from manufacturing was certain that offshoring spelled the end for US developers.<p>Personally, I had a different outlook, one that we should all remember when we sit at the negotiation table and that is, it is estimated that 10-20% of the population is mentally competent enough to write software and I would say that is a pretty good estimation. Probably another 5-10% border on competency so at best 30% of the population even has the capacity to code. We know the old 1 in 10 rule, that for every 10 programmers you hire 1 will be really good. So that puts us at what 3% of the population being exceptionally good developers? Probably another 6% being above average. Probably in the range of 10-15% being competent and the remainder costing companies more money than they are worth in lost time from the good developers carrying them.<p>So if you think about it somewhere around 9% of the world population is truly capable of good software development. And that is why despite the .com bust, the waves of offshoring and whatever will come before AI, the developer is one of the few bastions of the American middle class. It is by it&#x27;s nature self limiting as far as competition goes.",1435899443

9823584,comment,9823246,9823246,0,0,Taek,,,"Coding is a valuable skill because computers can do certain tasks far more efficiently than humans can, and in ways that add massive value to our lives. Every engineering industry I know has been transformed by tools created by programmers. Whether you are solving matrices or simulating aerodynamics, the cost of doing certain tasks and prototyping has reduced to almost zero thanks to computers.<p>And, as far as we can currently tell, there&#x27;s a massive amount of untapped potential. Whether your programming trading engines or social media, the right program, even a small program, has massive transforming power.<p>Even more significant, if a programmer writes a piece of code that makes a 0.01% improvement to a product, it&#x27;s virtually free to distribute that improvement to hundreds of millions of people . A programmer may not even need to be very good to add millions of dollars of value to a company if they are put in the right position.<p>As time goes forward, we are seeing substantial developments to the coding practice. Languages are getting better, compilers are getting better, theory is getting better, test suites are getting better. All of this results in programmers being that much more useful when put in the right situation. Iterating on programs is also very cheap. Rather than needing to build an entire new plane engine, you just recompile your code and throw it at the test suite again.<p>Will it stop? Probably not in the next few decades. As simulations and other tools get better, we may see other engineering industries catching up, but right now programming is unique in how accessible it is, how quickly you can iterate on a design, and how easily you can distribute improvements/products to millions and even billions of people.<p>Even if the supply of programmers expands dramatically, I can&#x27;t imagine running out of things to throw them at. There&#x27;s always another feature, or another product idea, or some other project that would take a substantial amount of programming resources to complete.<p>High salary programmers are here to stay. I don&#x27;t know where the ceiling is, but as the tools continue to improve, so will the justification of the salary. Even if we are in a bubble right now, the bubble bursting will still leave programmers in a very comfortable position.",1435899396

It&#x27;s basically been like this for at least the last 30 years (as long as I&#x27;ve been in the industry).  Demand outpaces supply.<p>Schools see programmers as a money making industry for them, so they mint new programmers as fast as they can (regardless of ability).  People in other industries move over to programming because there is such a demand that you can even get a job without any qualifications.  The end result is that even while demand is outstripping supply, the vast majority of the supply is under qualified to do the job.  Employers burned by under qualified employees agree to spend more and more money to hopefully find the needles in the haystack.  If they collude to agree not to pinch each other&#x27;s needles they get their hands slapped ;-).<p>Even if there is a world-wide economic downturn (like we just experienced), it plays into the hands of high salaries because under performing companies dump under performing employees on the market making it even harder to sort the wheat from the chaff.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like professional sports.  There is an endless supply of people willing to play sports for a living.  The competition to get the best of the best drives salaries up for everyone who gets a job.  I was surprised to learn that one of the Japanese soccer players that I follow who has been sitting on the bench of a poorly performing 2nd division European team for 2 years is making more than $1 million a year.<p>However... although I don&#x27;t see salaries going down for a very long time, I <i>do</i> see it getting progressively harder to get a job.

9823459,comment,9819798,9821704,0,0,pron,,,"That&#x27;s exactly what I said. The world <i>would</i> be radically different. The average inter-race genetic difference in pertinent qualities (say intelligence, body strength etc) is positively tiny compared to intra-group variance[1]. Those &quot;genetically different subpopulations&quot; are not that genetically different in any significant way in any quality that we would presume to matter. Unless skin color <i>directly</i> causes the power disparity (which, of course, it does because of racism) there is nothing else to explain the difference. If genetics were a very central cause of power difference, you would <i>not</i> see such severe power differences among groups.<p>There is absolutely nothing in the observations to even suggest genetics differences could be a meaningful contributor to power differences among groups, especially when you consider history. For example, the Arab culture was for centuries much superior to the European culture. Has there been some genetic catastrophe in the Arab world? European power superiority is a very recent change (roughly 600-500 years). That power was gained very quickly -- in the course of a few decades between 1450-1520[2] -- in what is known as the European miracle. Genetics don&#x27;t behave like that. If we were having this discussion as recently as 700 years ago, I guess you would naturally assume that Europeans have some inborn defect that makes them so inferior.<p>Also, we do not see <i>any</i> innate ability difference that in a measure that is even close to the levels of power disparity. No one is a hundred times smarter or stronger or faster than the average population. Yet you see both individuals and localized groups (at almost any size) that are easily a hundred (or a thousand) times more powerful than other individuals or localized groups. You cannot explain that without treating social forces as the leading cause.<p>Also, there is no need to write power in quotes. When discussing physics you don&#x27;t write energy or force or charge in quotes, right? No need to disrespect other serious disciplines. Power is a well-established, well-accepted concept -- even if for some reason you&#x27;ve convinced yourself it isn&#x27;t -- so show just an inkling of respect for other researchers.<p>[1]: Reading my previous comment again, I wrote exactly that. Are you intentionally trying not to understand again? Or are you just assuming there are large genetic differences because people look different?<p>[2]: In those few decades, the Byzantine empire fell (after a long decline), Europe started enjoying a remarkable recovery after the Black Death epidemic that had peaked a hundred years prior, America was discovered, print invented, and Christianity fractured. While at the same time, the Ottomans  rejected print (for religious reasons).",1435897457

How long do we have to wait for people to provide solid implementations on top of all the popular programming language and database backends? Feels like SQL all over again.

You state in an earlier comment “so if there was a committee that provided that evaluation entirely outside of the publishing ecosystem, that would be great”. You could theoretically have a PageRank-like system where some nodes are papers, some nodes are committees, and (maybe) some nodes are individuals. Then there could be different types of edges, expressing relations like “has cited this paper” or “deems this to be a quality paper” or “recognizes the competence/authority/prestige/whatever of this person/committee”. Then run PageRank on the whole mess.",1435896656

Let&#x27;s take another example, say publishing a novel. That&#x27;s something that has also never been easier to do in a wide variety of ways. But self publishing a novel isn&#x27;t (typically) enough to become a successful author. You need to somehow get your book to stand out as being better than the million other novels that people publish every year. So if someone can offer you a stamp of approval that the general public trusts, that gives people a reason to believe your book is worth their time more than other books, that&#x27;s a valuable service. And I have no problem with the idea that whoever can offer that service should be able to charge for it.<p>I think the ridiculous thing in 2015 is that academic prestige is still almost exclusively tied to the name of the journal in which it is published. That I still have a hard time wrapping my head around sometimes. So I imagine that that will eventually change, but I&#x27;m not convinced that the process of separating the good from the bad and bestowing that prestige will inevitably be free.",1435896298

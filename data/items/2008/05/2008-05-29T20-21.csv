Indeed scrapes jobs from all over, some have been filled, some are third party jobs etc.  About half of the jobs on LINKUP have never even been advertised.

As far as I know there is no established way to classify ideas, so that would make this a question not very well-suited for academic research. Actually, one of the reasons why I asked is because I'm interested in looking for patterns in what people consider to be interesting ideas. So far there are a lot of parallels with the answers that people here have been giving for the ""what have you discovered"" question, which is amusing, albeit not especially surprising.<p>If you are interested in infantile amnesia though, this paper is kind of interesting and gives a decent overview of the different theories:<p>Harley, K. & Reese, E.

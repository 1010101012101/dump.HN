2858051,comment,2856583,2857979,2,0,fossuser,,,"This is Tesla's statement on the issue:<p>""On March 29 2011, Tesla filed a lawsuit to stop Top Gears continued rebroadcasts of an episode containing malicious falsehoods about the Tesla Roadster. Top Gears Executive Producer, Andy Wilman, has drafted a blog to present their side of the story. Like the episode itself, however, his proclamations do more to confound than enlighten.<p>Mr. Wilman admits that Top Gear wrote the script before filming the testing of the Roadsters. The script in question, concluding with the line ""in the real world, it absolutely doesnt work"" was lying around on set while Top Gear was allegedly ""testing"" the Roadsters. It seems actual test results dont matter when the verdict has already been given -- even if it means staging tests to meet those predetermined conclusions.<p>Now Mr. Wilman wants us to believe that when Top Gear concluded that the Roadster ""doesn't work,"" it ""had nothing to do with how the Tesla performed."" Are we to take this seriously? According to Mr. Wilman, when Top Gear said the car ""doesn't work,"" they ""primarily"" meant that it was too expensive. Surely they could have come to that conclusion without staging misleading scenes that made the car look like it didnt work.<p>Mr. Wilman's other contentions are just as disingenuous. He states that they never said the Roadster ""ran out of charge."" If not, why were four men shown pushing it into the hangar?<p>Mr. Wilman states that ""We never said that the Tesla was completely immobilized as a result of the motor overheating."" If not, why is the Roadster depicted coming to a stop with the fabricated sound effect of a motor dying?<p>Mr. Wilman also objects to Tesla explaining our case, and the virtues of the Roadster. Top Gear has been re-broadcasting lies about the Roadster for years, yet are uncomfortable with Tesla helping journalists set the record straight about the Roadsters revolutionary technology.<p>Mr. Wilman seems to want Top Gear to be judged neither by what it says, nor by what it does. Top Gear needs to provide its viewers, and Tesla, straightforward answers to these questions.""<p>I hadn't heard that Tesla calculated that range, the direct quote from the show used the pronoun 'we' and I thought part of the suit was because the 55 mile range statement from top gear defamed Tesla and made them look as if they were lying about the range.",1312757749

2858046,comment,2855948,2855948,1,0,fmw,,,"A large part of our industry is self-taught. You don't need a specific degree to get a good job - or even a degree at all. Some bigger companies are a bit more formal (e.g. Google, Microsoft) and prefer hiring graduates, but even they look at merit before academic background. There are some jobs that benefit from academic experience, e.g. being a quant on Wall Street, but math or physics is a lot more useful for that than CS. If want to work in a field like that (or want to keep your options open) I'd recommend doing the double major or alternatively just major in math, while polishing your CS skills by working on open source software and maybe a few CS courses.<p>Getting a job out of college or differentiating yourself shouldn't be the prime motivator for this decision (if considered at all). Whichever way you graduate, you will be fine. It isn't like you're trying to decide between majoring in pottery class at a community college and going to med school. Future employers will be a lot more impressed by the depth of your understanding of your field than how many classes you took and the extra curricular activities are even more important (e.g. open source, internships, personal projects).",1312757602

2857975,comment,2857423,2857423,6,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"Decent article, but I guess I'll weigh in on the counter-points:<p>1. Uninformed consumers returning devices isn't unique to Android Tablets. It happens in basically every corner of the market. People buy Macs and wonder why their Windows apps don't work on them. There's really not much you can change about that, aside from trying to educate them slightly in whatever form of advertisement you have. I do think all the commercials for Android Tablets are terrible though. The iPad's wins by a landslide.<p>2. 16:9 vs 4:3 is really just personal preference. There are some apps that I really enjoy the 16:9 ratio for (like movies, books, and general internet browsing). For others, yes it does feel a bit wide or tall at times. This becomes a non-issue if you decide to go for a 7-inch tablet though, which I believe 3.2 just introduced support for.<p>3. There's a ""Featured Tablet"" application section on the market blatantly visible the first time you start the application. Unfortunately that's about where it ends, as there's no way to tell if an application is tablet-ready from its details page, and no way to filter for tablet-ready apps when doing a search. It's been said before, but the Market really needs an overhaul. I have noticed apps start to name themselves ""HD"" if they're tablet-ready, but that's not really consistent or a standard at this point.<p>4. Honeycomb's 3.2 version that released this past month now has the ""app zooming"" feature the author described missing.<p>5. It's been said before, but I'll repeat it here: the lack of tablet-ready apps is really just a matter of time. People tend to forget that it took iPad several months to get a decent selection of apps optimized for that screen size. This summer a good number started cropping up on the Market for Android, and now that more tablets are landing in the hands of developers (like the Transformer and Galaxy Tab), we'll no doubt see a ton of apps begin to flood us come Winter.",1312756089

As has been pointed out, nobody denies that technically the US can spin up the printing presses and make as many dollars as it wants. However, even ignoring the other catastrophic consequences that would have, there's also the considerations of the real wealth consequences we're committing to. It isn't just ""lots of money"", it's also things like committing real people to build real facilities so that other real people will take care of the real old people living in those facilities for years at a time on the government's dime. To exaggerate for clarity, we can't afford to have an economy in which everybody is dedicated either to caring for old people, treating old people, or supporting those who do. Somebody's actually got to be able to produce something to feed the economy. Obviously we can't get to this point, but it's not clear how much of our real economy can actually be dedicated to these things, because the support networks can end up being a lot deeper than surface intuition would expect. Studying modern military logistics can be very helpful; in particular, look for the statistics about how many support personnel there are per front-line soldier doing the ""actual"" military work, and apply the lessons to the ""real"" economy.",1312756007

2857938,comment,2857422,2857422,42,0,onan_barbarian,,,"We're [low-level programmers] not dead, we're pining for the fjords. Low level programming is a dark art, and there are naturally plenty of people celebrating how fantastic it is that they don't _have_ to know this stuff. Don't celebrate your ignorance; you may be 2-4 orders of magnitude off after your performance is sucked away by all those layers of abstraction.<p>My take on it is that ""low-level stuff"" isn't going away any time soon, and that there will always be a equilibrium reached between those who understand it and are fluent with it (and, sometimes, are going to be able to write code that is 5-100x faster) and those who don't.<p>It's orthogonal to an understanding of algorithms. No amount of bit-bashing can fix really poor choices of algorithms (N^2 vs NlogN, say, on a big input). That being said, there are a lot of tasks where everyone is going to land on the same linear or logN basic algorithm and the main difference is going to be the algorithm that misses cache frequently and is stuffed with branch mispredicts and pipeline stalls vs. some algorithm that avoids all these problems and runs 10x faster. Sometimes you've just got to go do something to every bit of data and there's no classic algorithmic trick.<p>For example, I helped a former academic colleague write the 'worlds fastest floating point minimum' routine using SSE and lots of unrolling/software pipelining and I think he got about 8-10x (he had a library for most of the common operations like vector add, mul, etc but it didn't do 'min'). No amount of rampant algorithmic cleverness would avoid the need to look at each data element once when trying to calculate the min of a vector and if you're doing WORSE than linear, you've got real problems.<p>The major point that I've discovered from doing this stuff for years (on considerably more complex cases than the example above) is that programming efficiently for a modern architecture is qualitatively different than designing algorithms for the abstract '1 operation counts as 1 operation' machine in your average algorithms textbook. Oddly, quite a bit of improvement in my scalar, non-parallel programming came about after having used CUDA fairly intensively - if you're writing code for a Core 2 Duo or beyond, you're already parallel programming even if you're designing code that's single-threaded. Understanding how to rethink your algorithm to have data-parallelism (not to mention using SSE) is just plain conceptually different and more akin to parallel programming than scalar programming.<p>Knowing when to do this is important; I like bashing out a quick Python script as much as the next guy, or perhaps some pretty random C++ STL code that's probably an order of magnitude from where it should be (not because the STL is bad but because, say, I've been bone-lazy with design). So all those 'I have 10 layers of abstraction above this level"" nincompoops shouldn't get too smug; we (low-level guys) can go there too - just because we know how to optimize C/asm loops to within an inch of their lives doesn't mean that we're going to compulsively do it with every last one.<p>Also worthy of note - the right thing to do changes frequently; some of the resources (especially on branch prediction) listed are already out of date. Don't bring P4 knowledge to a Sandy Bridge fight. Some bit twiddling hacks are great, others (especially ones that assume multiply is ultra-expensive) are obsolete on recent x86. The concepts still keep their validity a lot more than, say, all that newfangled crud that you youngsters fill your heads with (LAMP stacks, etc.) :-)",1312755485

Later practitioners merged this with traditional acrobatics and martial arts moves to create a style sometimes differentiated as ""free running"", which is much more about the exhibition value of the performance. Since it's flashier, and easier to film, you usually see this in videos but lots of people will tell you that's not ""real"" parkour. (Not in a bad way; it's just a different sport.)",1312754457

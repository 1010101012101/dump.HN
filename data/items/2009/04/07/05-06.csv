It worked like a charm.<p>I never considered using the same techniques for, e.g., chatting up young ladies until about this year.  Works like a charm.  <i>Effity</i> I wish I had realized that ten years ago.  (Some of the techniques, anyhow.  The whole play-to-crush ethos, not so much.  Eye contact?  Sounding confident of what you are saying?  Intently listening and coming back to things you've both said later in the conversation for emphasis?  They work great.)",1239083857
550486,comment,550256,550256,0,0,wahlee,,,"I've spent time working at one of the ""best"" Wall Street banks as a student. I'm considering taking a full time job. At the time that I got started down the path I just applied to companies that had the reputations for having the smartest people.<p>I did indeed work with some very bright people on some challenging and cool projects. The smart people and cool projects notwithstanding, there are still annoying quirks/red tape/etc anytime you work at a big Wall St. firm.\nAlso, there is this conveyor belt system that if you've been around Wall Street you probably notice. Many of the people I worked with follow a similar life pattern: attended a ""prestigious"" college, landed their first job out of school on the Street, they work hard to get significant promotion after X years, then they work their asses off and finally after 2*X years get a corner office and a major promotion.<p>I actually asked some of the fellow interns/new hires I worked with point-blank: if you are this talented, and can work this hard for the firm... why not go off on your own and let your ability take you as far as you can go? I got laughed off, and I felt a little embarrassed for even posing the question at the time (this was before the complete sub-prime collapse).<p>As I mentioned above, I'm still considering a full time job. I think my reasoning is based primarily on the good pay, access to smart people, and interesting projects. Do I think I could be doing better for myself? Heck yes. Why do I settle then? It's hard to get off the conveyor belt.",1239083713

Mathematically, you should, as the probablity of winning is a lot larger,  but realistically you have 50% chance that you might loose 50k right away.<p>Assuming that all your savings are 100k,  would you have the stomach to a accept this risk?<p>Most normal people, probably not.

I think what he meant to say is that the article made sweeping generalizations about the quality of human decision making, resting on a few superficial stats and questionable assumptions. It also fetishized tricks to change folks' behavior while pretending that Obama's public policy goals are indisputable. Since one man's ideal world is not the same as another man's, and the form one's ideal world takes is generally governed by first principles that can't be proved, and since public policy is the means to transform the world into one's ideal, the notion that the administration's policies can't be criticized is ludicrously silly. Sure, I'm interested in the means, but it's by no means settled what the ends should be.

Those goofy boxes on the belt, wires down your sleeve, and dorky glasses were just to throw us off the trail. Instead, one tiny elegant step at a time, it will sneak up on us until suddenly a killer app leaps out makes us realize that our iShuffPhoneTouch is <i>it</i>.",1237016349

But obviously some managers and organizations don't get that. The list is <i>funny</i>, because I've seen these things happen, and I can empathize with the fight people went through while learning some of them.",1237015383

I draw the line when adults consume certain mind-altering substances and might endanger others. However, moderate consumption of marijuana seems to be less dangerous than alcohol, so I believe the only obstacle there seems to be is the legacy of the cotton industry's lobbying some decades ago. Interesting how society takes so long to adjust...",1237015084

They also have to go after your customers and your momentum, so there are two aspects of launch: revealing what was once secret, and publicizing that offering as best as possible - which is what a good launch should do -- and then also harnessing feedback.<p>If one can't execute all those simultaneously, it's better to sit back and watch competition do it instead, and whilst doing this, it may or may not be advantageous to be public.",1237014320

515711,comment,515605,515687,0,0,gnaritas,,,"> Imagine stoned drivers losing control of their SUVs and running over little children walking out of school.<p>Or how about don't imagine that, it's ignorant.  Running over children walking out of school is <i>already</i> illegal.  It's not at all an argument against legalization, it's just a cheap emotional appeal tossing kids into the mix to get sympathy.<p>We do not need to imagine how things affect the <i>children</i> every time society brings up some issue of what adults can or can't do to their own bodies.<p>Secondly, in a free society, you don't argue for legalization, you argue for making something illegal, legal should be the default status.  The question is not why should we legalize marijuana, it's what justifies it being illegal.  The answer is nothing, it's absurd and unjustified.<p>It should be legal because there is no valid reason for it to be illegal.  There is no justification for telling an adult what they can or can't do to their own body.  The drug is not addictive, tends to only calm people down and make them hungry, and is far safer than alcohol.<p>That it is illegal is far more related to the politics of the cotton industry not wanting competition from hemp 60 years ago than for any reason to do with the drug itself or the safety of it.",1237014056

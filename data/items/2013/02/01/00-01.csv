If that number crosses the threshold them bam! you get a new SKU.<p>A little as a year ago people were saying ""There is no 'tablet' market, there is an 'ipad' market.""

Yes adult bullying, and harassing, and adult social kliqs and all that exist. It is not just teenagers who are abused by bullies but adults as well.<p>In your startup you have to have a way to treat people who develop a mental illness and find a way to get them therapy and medication to get better and accommodate them and support them. You should not consider them of less value and demote them and cut their salary, you should not fire them, or consider it a weakness or personality flaw.<p>The way classical management treats the mentally ill, it is no wonder that suicides are up, and that some became workplace shooters, and many others just go on disability or become homeless or end up in an endless cycle of jails and mental hospitals. You need to have management deal with mental illnesses better than it currently does and it can even effect the CEO of your business as well.<p>It would do you well to hire some people with psychology, and sociology skills that can work with therapy that any employee can go to for help. You also need people who can watch out for warning signs as well. This should be a function of your HR department and your EAP (Employee Assistance Program) with the state or some other government agency.<p>Yes I've been suicidal in the past, yes I had friends kill themselves over issues of not finding work, stress from the job, and other stuff. I am a member of Generation-X the suicide generation and in my early 40's. It is a miracle that I am still alive, but since I am mentally ill no startup or community wants me. Being excluded can lead to suicidal thoughts as well you know.",1359679290

If our inventor can only buy and sell the S&P 500 they can't make a whole lot - it generally climbs at a pretty steady, known rate; when it moves dramatically it's usually a fall rather than a rise, so you need to be able to short to take advantage of those moments. If the inventor's buying and selling junk bonds, or advanced derivatives contracts, they can make money pretty quickly for as long as they can find people willing to trade with them.<p>Also the total value available to be made in HFT is pretty low (on the order of tens of billions of dollars/year). To make serious money you need enough capital to be able to make somewhat longer-term investments.<p>3) Prices for mature, stable, dividend-paying companies would increase a little bit so that their P/E matched that of Treasury bonds. Futures contracts would probably stick around (although they're now essentially just another form of loan) but options would disappear, because you'd have to be stupid to buy/sell them.<p>The effect on the industry is that there's a lot less inefficiency available to exploit, so much less money to be made. The industry contracts; market-making becomes a boring way to earn small amounts of money, like car insurance. The smart people go elsewhere.<p>For riskier investments and especially young companies we'd see more dramatic shifts; a share in Facebook is now worth however much a share in Facebook is worth as a mature company (discounted by the risk-free interest rate). So a few would shoot up to 40x their current value, while many would drop low enough to be delisted.<p>In the slightly longer term an IPO becomes some kind of weird singularity - everyone knows which companies are going to be huge, as soon as they go public. The SEC would hopefully relax the rules (because their reporting rules are now basically obsolete) so we'd see companies being listed much sooner, or even funded based on whether or not they show up in the future data. Suddenly, every startup is a megahit, and there are many more of them, because it's now a safe way to make enormous amounts of money, so everyone wants to found one (or at least, everyone who has it in them to found one that works). The market abhors safe ways to make lots of money, so all the investment money available pours into this, and we hit the singularity in fairly short order.",1359678844

Clearly, the whole kernel is developed by a very distributed ""team"".<p>That said, you get right to the heart of the matter: the interactions between kernel components are well established. Sufficiently so that one person can work independently on a subsystem and another on a driver.<p>In my own personal experience, designing component interfaces is the most important aspect of building a system, especially when you are working with a team. Very often, I have found that the ""all in one room"" development model is implemented because the team lacks the ability to define those interfaces first. They are very fluid and so it's necessary to be able to lean back and yell at the guy working on the driver or subsystem and say ""yo, I need this additional parameter"". On a distributed team you need to write that in an email and that extra effort is often seen (rightly or wrongly) as a major bottleneck.<p>Where I have seen companies fail to work successfully with geographically distributed teams, it has generally been because their ""all in one room"" culture has allowed them to establish an adequate process/culture around designing quality component interfaces in an efficient manner. This inability to define quality ""contracts"" is typically what leads to slipped projects and missed expectation. Often times, it is what plagues teams that are co-located.<p>If you can do a good job at defining system components and their interfaces, doing the development independently and distributed is easy. You can write test harnesses and stubs around those APIs. The question is: can you work on that design process in a distributed manner as well?<p>In my experience, it doesn't matter, local or remote. Designing component interfaces is hard work and hard to get right. But it is essential.",1359678662

How can you possibly hope to get your job done that way?<p>Actually getting your job done and being a martyr are two different things, and you need to decide which you want. If you want the former, then when five p.m. comes around, stand up and walk away from the computer. Your work will still be waiting for you tomorrow either way, but this way you'll be fit to do it.",1359677297

They never work in actual outages, cause more host outages than they solve, and are in no way a substitute for having humans on site.

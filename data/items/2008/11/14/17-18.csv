Ozzie found it.  Thus far, I have not.  My research suggests that tutti frutti (also known as ""frozen pudding"") is readily available in Massachusetts, so when I was in Cambridge for a week last month, I fully expected to find it.<p>Toscanini's didn't have it.  Brigham's website claims they make frozen pudding from September through December, but when I stopped in at the Brigham's parlor near the Free Software Foundation in Boston, the rather grim clerk at the counter muttered ""it's seasonal; we don't have any.""<p>I asked a native Boston tour guide about it.  He said that some guy in his neighborhood makes it, but just closed up shop for the winter.  I spent $40 in taxi fare going to grocery stores in search of it.  Nothing.  I tried several other ice cream parlors; only one person laughed.  I did end up getting some tasty butter pecan ice cream at a shop in Harvard Square, but it just wasn't what I was after.<p>I realize this is (mostly) off-topic, but has anyone here ever eaten tutti frutti ice cream?

364526,comment,364254,364436,0,0,palish,,,"Personally, I feel that we worry way too much about keeping our source code top-secret.  One reason people think source code is valuable is because ""the resulting product is valuable, so therefore the source code is even more valuable, right?"" ... well, no.  The product is valuable because of the thousands of small decisions you made as you were developing the product.  The source code is just the manifestation of those decisions.  In other words, the product is valuable because of its design, not because of the source code that describes that design.  Just because someone has access to a product's source code doesn't mean they can make valuable decisions about it.  And if they can't do that, then they can't ""steal"" your hard work by building on top of it and selling it.  They just don't have the domain experience to do that.  Plus, they would always be slightly behind you in terms of development, because you're constantly adding new features and fixing bugs.<p>I'm actually toying with the idea of shipping the source code to my first game when I release it.  The game will be pretty large-scale (it's 3D, as just one example) so the game engine's source code could potentially be very valuable.  However, I feel that I shouldn't necessarily keep it closed-source, because the profits from <i>actually selling the game</i> would far outweigh profits from licensing the engine, so it wouldn't be tactically wise to spend time on trying to license the code.  Therefore, the closed-source model doesn't really provide a competitive advantage, so why not open-source it?<p>A potential problem with ""open source on launch"" is that someone could immediately clone the product and sell it for less.  Except they can't.  In the case of my game, I'm going to copyright all of the art assets and other game data.  To clone the game, they would need to copy and redistribute that game data, which is illegal, which means I could sue them and shut them down.  It would be an annoyance, but it doesn't make sense for them to do that anyway, so I doubt many people will try.<p>Also, piracy isn't a problem for the ""open source on launch"" model.  In the case of desktop products, releasing the source code would allow pirates to easily circumvent any copy protection embedded in your code.  But the thing is, it's easy to crack a closed-source program's copy protection anyway.  It won't cause additional people to pirate your desktop product.  And if your product is server-side, then by definition it can't be pirated.<p>Lastly, consider this.  If it's harmful to open source a propriety application, then there should be examples which support that conclusion.  However, can you find just one example of a company that failed or was harmed because they open-sourced their application?  Id Software has released the source code to many of their games (Doom, Quake 1, 2, and 3, etc).  Quake 3 generated over a <i>billion</i> dollars in revenue, and yet its source code is free to all.  And it's very unlikely that Id was hurt by that decision.<p>It seems like source code protection is one of those logical fallacies that's easy for most people to believe, as long as they don't think about it too much.  (Like ""the world <i>seems</i> flat, so therefore it <i>must be</i> flat"".)",1226683973

Therefore, if Obama's candidacy had not boosted turnout, Prop. 8 probably would have passed by an even higher margin.<p>Yes, black voters voted 70-30 in favor of Prop. 8, but they were only 10% of the electorate, and lots of other demographic subgroups favored it as well.  (E.g., 22% of the voters attend church weekly--I bet that 22% includes the vast majority of the black voters--and they favored Prop. 8 by 82-18.)  So I think treating the black vote as <i>the</i> reason for Prop. 8's passage is unfair.",1226683151

364494,comment,363891,364140,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Who cares if two slackers succeed? The whole argument is that talent is inherently pointless. I wasn't a talented writer as a child, hell my 3rd grade teacher told my parents I might be dyslexic and I'd need to take special needs classes until I graduate. Before the end of the summer after I graduated I got a job as a journalist, and at the same time my friends who in 3rd grade were supposedly phenomenally talented in English were going to take a 2 year introduction to English at university and then a 5 year journalism course.<p>I wasn't born with an uncanny writing talent, I was thought to be retarded but I liked telling stories. So I spent a lot of my childhood from 13 years old, when I realized that I wanted to write books for a living, practicing writing. I read huge amounts of books to learn how different people write and taught myself.<p>At 17 (I'm from the UK I graduated at 16) the editor was telling me I was the most talented writer they had. I surprised him one day, he sent me an email at around 6 saying one review I did wasn't how they wanted it (which was the reason I left, the product I reviewed sucked ass but because it came from a big company we couldn't offend them) so he said it needed changing. An hour later I emailed him back with the entire thing rewritten the score from a 1 to a 8.  For everyone who doesn't know the review game; for example a video game review, if it takes 10 hours to play the game it will probably take you around 20 hours to review and edit it, so getting an essentially new review in an hour was amazing to him.<p>The reason why I could do a review in an hour that would take anyone else a day to get back. Well because I'm driven. I'm sure there were more talented people on the staff, but that doesn't mean shit when I can consistently out perform someone 10:1.<p>So yes being talented will help you, but if you're a slacker you're not going anywhere to begin with.",1226682809

I'm not questioning your motives. :)<p>1. Yes, the appropriate question is whether we can generalize from this data.  One should prefer uncorrelated data points when sampling data, which is why I say you only have 26 data points.  Is it ""better than nothing""?  Depends on what conclusions you draw.  ""Tea leaves"" are better than nothing if you just think they're pretty.  But if you think they have meaning, then they're worse than nothing.  In this case, the study has zero predictive value because there is no scientific result.<p>2. I understand what the N means, but it's misleading since in statistics one usually thinks of N as referring to the number of independent data points.<p>3. What I mean is: a ""real"" data point would be an actual market decline of 20-50%.  In your model, some of those declines may be represented only once (say, because there was a market recovery the following month), and others are represented up to 11 times (because there was no recovery for the next 11 months).  So not only do you have a (much) <i>smaller</i> sample (by a factor of between 60 and 360 depending on which analysis) than your ""N"" reports, but you also have a <i>biased</i> sample because each buy signal is represented for a varying amount of time depending on how many months it lasted for.  This means that, of the handful of market declines which actually occurred in the last century, you might really be representing an even <i>smaller</i> sample.<p>4. You did draw the following conclusion: ""For 10-year investments, investing when the market is down 20% to 50% is probably going to produce better returns than a investment at a random point in time, but it's a close call"".<p>Anyways, thanks for your reply.

Thus even after discounts, the higher price of Apple products means a greater revenue for the bookstore than Windows or Linux based machines (and greater net earnings assuming constant margins).<p>The amount a student is able to borrow depends on the costs calculated by the University. Therefore, the higher cost of Macs can be built in to the student's loan package - with the university receiving a portion of that additional money back with fewer restrictions on how it is spent (unlike tuition and fees). That is particularly attractive to public universities.<p>In smaller college towns, the University may be the only bookstore which sells Macs due to the difficulty an independent bookstore has in qualifying as a Mac dealer as Apple has shifted its retail strategy over the past few years. This again gives the university a financial incentive to require Macs and other Apple products.",1299257135

And this I think is true, but actually by design.  It's funny because when I consulted I ran into the opposite problem.  I'd go into shops and the devs wanted to do some cutting edge stuff.  I usually came in and convinced them that this was a bad idea.  :-)<p>The reason for this was pretty simple -- usually the stuff they wanted to use wasn't ready, and didn't match the culture of enterprise shops.  For example I remember NHibernate picking up steam and lots of shops wanting to use it, but there were a lot of holes in it still.<p>And DVCS is another great example.  In enterprises there is very little advantage of Git over SVN.  SVN's offline support has been great for years now.  I can add/revert without touching the network.  And in the enterprise you don't have a model of ""anyone pull down a branch"".  You want a very controlled version of the code around.  Yet, again, a lot of .NET devs want to use Mercurial and my recommendation, in most cases, is that its not a good idea.<p>BUT source control is a great example where .NET devs have clearly not towed the line, given that I rarely see a shop using TFS.  Everyone uses SVN or Mercurial.  Just as no one used Source Safe in the past.  If .NET devs just followed MS blindly we'd see all of these .NET devs using TFS and waiting for MS to make it better.

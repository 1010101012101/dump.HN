By late 1945 the allied bombing campaign was sufficiently geared up to destroy entire cities on a recurring basis. It was as effective as the atomic bombings, it was merely a lot less efficient (hundreds of planes and crews instead of just one). Had Japan held off surrendering, and had that conventional bombing campaign continued much longer the destruction would have been far greater.<p>Had the allies then lacked the courage to mount a landed invasion and been satisfied with a negotiated peace instead of an unconditional surrender, Japan would have become a devastated country with few allies and many enemies, it would not have been rebuilt with foreign assistance and would almost certainly be a 3rd world nation or perhaps even a failed state today.",1278438981

No.  Not even this sentence has only words of four letters or less.<p>However many major contributions of Newton, Descartes, and Einstein to mathematics and science have been broken down and simplified until they both can be and are routinely taught to high school students.

All are covered, along with a great many other things, in the first half of the first book alone.

A couple of examples he brought up:<p>* e-readers are still relatively new, and have not (yet) changed the publishing industry. That a screen can replace the printed page is still contested.[1] (Stoll: “At best, it's an unpleasant chore: the myopic glow of a clunky computer replaces the friendly pages of a book.” — I still hear things like this today.)<p>* The Internet has not yet revolutionized and re-democratized the government. (During the whole Google Fiber hub-bub, I heard many an optimist bring up this idea in my community.) Hell, in the United States, up to 25% of the population does not use the Internet.[2]<p>* I’m a self-driven learner but I don’t think I ever learned anything of practical application via an online course or a multimedia-driven online museum. Learning <i>information</i> is one thing, but I still think it’s hard to replicate the <i>experience</i> of in-person discourse and interaction. Just a personal observation.<p>Discounting a medium entirely is likely a poor choice since media (as in “formats for communication”) tend to last a very, very long time. All of the science fiction hopes and dreams tacked onto the medium? Not so much. These things take time, and Stoll was at least spot-on calling out things that were at best disappointing about the Internet in the 90’s.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/200491/reading_on_paper_is_faster_than_ibooks_on_the_ipad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/200491/reading_on_paper_is_fa...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.internetworldstats.com/am/us.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetworldstats.com/am/us.htm</a>",1278438217

Just like that shy girl from Texas who took a chance and made it big in movies, companies like Google who made a fortune out of bits and bytes capture our hearts more than conglomerates, shipping companies, oil companies, or banks.  These are the companies that actually make money when ads get clicked.",1278435709

The best-case scenario if you teach yourself isn't much better than high school, while the worst-case scenario is much worse.<p>The idea that you should drop out of high school appeals to three particular ways in which teenagers are dumb:<p>1.

I'm a high school dropout with two bachelor's degrees from Carnegie Mellon, a six-figure computer programming job and a similar disdain for the public education system.<p>I won't say dropping out of high school was the best thing I've ever done, but it saved me a year of boredom and staying would have done me no good.

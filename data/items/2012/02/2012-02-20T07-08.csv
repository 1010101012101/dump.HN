This seems wrong to me. On the other end if Merck or Pfizer were to get pissed off at say Libya and deny its people certain drugs I would support suspending their property rights.<p>I agree that this situation is ridiculous and that the black market is often a solid incentive for legislators to re-consider ridiculous regulation. But the suspension of property rights is something that should be thought out meticulously before implementation; in this case it fits into the greater debate on the nature of IP as a ""true"" property.<p><i>Pro-copyright UN organization administering it</i><p>I don't think the UN was actively involved in any of these decisions nor overtly in their enforcement <i>any more than it is in other issues</i> - the author was simply quoting UN statutes to underline how this is an evolving debate.",1329724139
3611682,comment,3610844,3611218,3,0,gbog,,,"> Normalisation matters to transaction processing.<p>If you mean to mean that normalization matters only for transactional processing, I dare disagree. Normalization matters for data sanity. Building and maintaining a complex and agile application is much easier on properly normalized data. Making sure one bit of data is stored only in one place and is properly decoupled from other bits of data's existence is still the Right Thing to do. True, it is sometime in direct contradiction with data access performance, but this is an optimization issue, which can be solved with denormalization, materialization or the use of some ""NoSQL"" storage.<p>Anyway, in these NoSQL discussions I always wonder: As far as I know, Wikipedia is still using a purely relational data-store, and it's main data (an enormous dict of blobs) seem to be the perfect candidate for a non-relational storage. So then, if NoSQL is so good at this task, how come they don't have moved yet? Should they move? (Genuine question)",1329724125

This is where the companies were the most risk averse, when this is really where they should be willing to take the biggest risk.<p>I did a phone screen with two different divisions of a different company. One wanted to fly me out, the other decided they were looking for someone with ""better coding skills"" which is weird, since they didn't have me write any code during the interview. I didn't really feel like either interview with the company went that much better/worse than the other, but it resulted in drastically different outcomes. I flew out for the first division and was offered, and took, the job.<p>When one division of your company hires someone that another division thought wasn't qualified, I think you probably need to rework some parts of your hiring process.<p>My solution? Invest a little more time in your phone screens. Don't do just one, unless the person is a COMPLETE moron. Try a few people and get different perspectives. It's not fair for the candidate to lose out on the opportunity because they got a bad interviewer and it's no good for the company to lose out on the candidate just because the interviewer had an off day.",1329724097

Obviously, that is mostly not the case and people in Japan work therefore sometimes multiple jobs, just to not look poor through their spending habits/clothing/gadgets w/e.

3611663,comment,3609418,3610602,2,0,barrkel,,,"Writing a state machine such that state transitions map to instruction pointer changes can be a viable technique. For example, using Pascal - handy because of sets - your example could be recognized thusly, with cp: PChar, or ^Char:<p><pre><code>    start := cp;
    if cp^ in ['+', '-'] then Inc(cp);
    if cp^ in ['1'..'9'] then Inc(cp) else goto no_match;
    while cp^ in ['0'..'9'] do Inc(cp);
    SetString(str, start, cp - start);
</code></pre>
I don't think this is tedious at all. The various components of a regular expression have analogues in code: * and + become loops, ? and | if statements, character classes become set membership tests (which is nice in Pascal). For most token definitions used in practical programming languages, writing lexers for them by hand is fairly trivial; and when things get more complicated, the freedom of having hand-coded the lexer usually gives you more tools to solve those complications.<p>Having a lexer coded as a loop driven by state transition tables can be useful in other scenarios, however; for example, if you only receive a little bit of input at a time, and you want to continuously lex it until a whole token has formed. There, you want to be able to suspend tokenizing at any point, and resume it later. Without coroutines, continuations or threads, this is more awkward when hand-coding.",1329723563

Why not embrace the community's desire to make titles available in different markets, but manage it in such a way that the publisher is involved in the process and has ultimate approval over a digitized version? Active community members get books for free based on the degree of their participation. Everyone else gets to buy designated ""community editions"" of titles with a proper cut going back to the copyright owner. The community platform takes enough money to keep itself ticking over, including a cut for partner services that make it possible to sell in hard-to-reach global markets.<p>Sounds crazy, perhaps, but only because publishers still want a one-way relationship. A deep participative relationship with their global community of readers would only be a good thing. And it's less crazy for the publishers / authors than not making any money from these markets at all.",1329721661

AT&T did essentially lose its own lawsuit against Univ of California over BSD Unix. Some SysV code might actually be BSD code with UC copyright notice removed.  Also, some SysV code might be 32V unix code, which was distributed <i>without</i> the copyright notice that was required of copyrighted material back in the day.  So 32V code was in the public domain.<p>In any case, copyrights aren't all that clear with SysV, so Novell selling them outright might have caused even more litigation, with System V maybe ending up public domain.<p>But it is an unholy mess.",1269993529

The understanding part is a parser, so you are going to have to ensure the correctness of that with test cases -- you can never <i>prove</i> correctness, you can only show that it works on a lot of input.<p>The rest of your application, however, will be modeled on a finite number of possible states that this data structure represents.  This means you can use better tools (things like Catch) to ensure correctness; you can literally prove that there is never a case you don't handle, for example.  This gets you reliable code more quickly than random testing does.<p>Anyway, to answer the OP's questions, web apps should be tested like everything else.

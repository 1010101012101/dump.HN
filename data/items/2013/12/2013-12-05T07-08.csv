Personality traits are pretty well studies, and you don&#x27;t just get monsters and the timid.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of people who mean well, and are &quot;doers&quot;.<p>Personality traits tend to be normally distributed. There&#x27;s a few heroes, a few monsters, and a lot of in-betweeners; even if you&#x27;re just looking at people with low anxiety and low agreeableness.<p>And there&#x27;s a reason why a lot of those &quot;in between&quot; movers and shakers don&#x27;t try to take down the assholes - it&#x27;s because these assholes generally go down in flames, eventually.

Adding functionality to support multiple parties would be huge!<p>Additionally, there is an international treaty called the NY convention that allows for arbitrators&#x27; decisions to be taken to local courts for enforcement of non-monetary judgments.  It would be amazing if you built in an option for public parties (think apple vs samsung) who have decided to use bitcoin as a payment in an typical contract to verify their identities so that the bitcoin portion of the arbitration could be included in enforcement of other elements (sometimes courts require dditional penalties/fees, or physical performance of parts of contracts in addition to the money settlement).

An option on a board seat is, approximately, as expensive <i>or more expensive</i> than a board seat.  For example, it&#x27;s going to cause auto-failures of negotiations with later stage firms who would otherwise be prepared to pay market price for board seats (my SWAG from outside the Valley is &quot;in the neighborhood of multiple millions currently&quot;), because board seats have to be static and scarce to retain value.<p>You also probably uniquely cause signaling risk because at least some actors are going to model your decision to take or not take board seats like they would themselves choose to take or not take board seats, and come to the conclusion &quot;A prior investor has <i>a free option on a board seat</i> and has declined to exercise it, despite having had full knowledge of the business&#x27; deepest secrets for the last year?  Wow, that makes my investing decision a lot easier: PASS!&quot;<p>2)  It seems to me that your strategic reason for asking for the option to a board seat is that you desire to take a personal hand in managing downside risk when some startups you fund implode.  This implies that you both believe your contribution will help to manage downside risk when startups implode, and that rescuing imploding startups is a great use of your time.  Many people in the community would advise that a startup which is imploding is almost immune to correctional action and accordingly valued at approximately zero, and that startups imploding is sort of the model and that your main source of risk reduction is having 7.5% invested in Google 2020 rather than tweaking twenty imploded companies to slightly-north-of-imploded.<p>Or, to rephrase, if the successful outcome is &quot;We do not get a board seat&quot; then do not ask for a board seat.",1386228018

Bank accounts can, and do have negative balances[1]. Both the banks and the credit card companies, are in a position to attach liens, refer to collections, and generally destroy the credit worthiness of an individual or a merchant as a result of a dispute between the merchant and a customer, as a result of a chargeback. The bank may be left with an unfunded liability, but they are equipped with a number of legal ways to collect on that from the individual who opened the account. The entire banking industry is built upon the singular question of when and how liability is transferred. Further that structure is backed by the enforcement arms of the government which has licensed the bank. This is underneath the level of what the typical retail banking customer sees or experiences.<p>You pay someone in cash, and they rip you off, there is no way for you to get your money back except to sue them, send some enforcers around to threaten them, or to steal something of theirs of equal value and sell it. This is <i>exactly</i> the same way BitCoin works. It was designed that way, and it is the very definition of &#x27;irreversible.&#x27;<p>Once a transaction is <i>complete</i> there is no way for it to be reversed without <i>both parties</i> participating in the process. And this is fundamentally different than a banking/payments system which <i>is</i> reversible.<p>Now it would be possible to create a structure using BitCoin that would have the property of being reversible, which is you bring a third party into the mix, a Bank, and create a series of regulations and rules about how and when transactions are voided and those institutions cause the reversals to actualize in the respective accounts of holders. But that is not how it works <i>today.</i> The current BitCoin payments system is equivalent to a bunch of people walking around with suitcases full of cash.<p>You can argue it is a &#x27;strength&#x27; or you can argue it is a &#x27;weakness&#x27; of BitCoin that completed transactions are not reversible, but it is a matter of fact that this is a fundamental difference between BitCoin as a payment mechanism and currency as a payment mechanism.<p>[1] I once participated in a long running conversation with Bank of America about this when the account in question was mine.

I think you identify these, but do not quite separate them as much as I believe you should.<p>I agree, this is the crux of the issue.<p>> It refers to the process of arbitrarily unbounded enumeration (having the potential to count to any arbitrary number).<p>This is too narrow. The world is full of infinite processes including your life or the earth revolving around the sun, etc. These are the facts that give rise to the concept though enumeration is the archetypical example because its so easy to see. The danger is forgetting that that someone (or a TM) must be doing the enumeration and eventually he (it) will die, planets will be engulfed by the sun, etc. So no real process goes on literally for infinity.<p>>Aristotle&#x27;s argument is that the human mind (Turing Machine) is restricted to computing decidable problems and cannot compute undecidable ones.<p>He went even farther than that -- he argued that what ever the mind (or Turing machine) is processing, becoming aware of or knowing has to be finite too. His basic principle of existence is that whatever exists must have identity, including the mind.<p>> It does not have to physically exist, but we certainly can theoretically associate a finite characterization to it.<p>Here is where we disagree or maybe misunderstand each other. You are equivocating on &quot;it&quot;. &quot;It&quot; what? By definition, infinity leaves undefined the length, life or extent of the process. Whatever the process is, it is open-ended. Now you can&#x27;t add back or sneak in some finite measure of the length or extent of the process without destroying its meaning.  What you can do is say things about the process even while abstracting away its metaphysical and eventual termination. This is in fact the main value of infinity as a mathematical concept, such as with limits.<p>> A similar argument would lead to the conclusion that pi does not exist...<p>Well, what do you mean by &quot;exist&quot;? Clearly the relation it identifies exists but it does not denote a specific number. Pi denotes a specific open-ended process to calculate a number based on what you are trying to do with the math. So if you are buying tile for your circular patio you might use 3.14 to determine the area and how much tile you need but if you are a NASA engineer and want to land a rover on Mars you&#x27;ll need to carry a few more decimal places, but not an infinite number of them, and the meaning is clear.<p>That Pi is irrational means that curved paths are incommensurable with linear measures. This did not stop the mathematicians as they just defined a symbol to represent an infinite process (implicitly at first but later fully developed in calculus) that defines the ratio and treat it just like any other number in further equations and theory, and in that sense it is a specifically defined number, and math theory could proceed.<p>The mistake that mathematicians made, primarily due to Plato, was thinking that Pi is a &quot;completed&quot; number in some super reality where ideal, abstract math exists. It was just a matter of time before Cantor came along and applied the same idea to infinity itself.",1386227449

Clojure has very nice testing frameworks that makes this trivial.<p>Hm. I&#x27;ve worked with &quot;very nice testing frameworks&quot;, but I&#x27;m not aware of any which helps with the two main issues that crop up when you create integration tests:<p>- integration with external tools (external database, LDAP...)<p>- amount of setup in your application necessary prior to running scenarios<p>> The REPL allows doing a lot of what unit tests are normally used for. When you make a change you test it live in the REPL. This is no different from running a unit test.<p>Well, considering that a well-tested unit of code (ie, what you put in a single file) is usually dwarfed in size by the test code itself, because you&#x27;re testing a lot of scenarios, then you either spend an unholy amount of time in the REPL, or you don&#x27;t test everything. Which brings me to my second point: unit tests will run the same tests every single time. And even better, <i>everybody</i> in the team will run the same unit tests every single time.<p>A REPL is no substitute for unit tests. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not useful, because it allows you to validate an idea fairly quickly, especially in simple cases, but it is absolutely not suited to validate the correctness of a piece of code.<p>> Hence why you don&#x27;t run them all the time. The REPL provides you with rapid feedback, much more rapid than running unit tests I might add.<p>I fully agree with that (though running unit tests on a single unit of code is very quick).<p>> Meanwhile, the integration tests are used for overall sanity testing.<p>Sure. But in my experience: most codebases have little to no integration tests, and they cover things like &quot;make sure login is not broken&quot; or &quot;make sure saving an entry works&quot; as opposed to &quot;make sure login does not break with the login &#x27;null&#x27;&quot; or &quot;make sure we reject an entry which contains invalid XML&quot;, because the cost of setting up scenarios is much higher than with integration tests.",1386227426

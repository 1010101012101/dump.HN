If you were to automate their labor, it would cause substantial unemployment and or reductions in pay. I'd argue their society couldn't withstand that shock at this point. In the extremely near future, China's huge supply of labor is going to rupture their economy rather than being a net benefit. The robot productivity wave in manufacturing over the next quarter century will be extremely painful for them.<p>Whereas if the US re-acquires 50,000 jobs from robotics related to making garments (commodities & materials (farming, cotton), shipping, R&D, assembly of robots, maintenance of robots, etc etc) it's a massive win. Also, it would mean keeping wealth / capital in the US market, rather than sending it to another nation to the benefit of their future and labor pool. Then instead of buying a shirt made in China from Walmart, you buy the same shirt at Walmart and all the money stays domestically.<p>There's no winning scenario for China from robotic manufacturing.",1339397840

4093479,comment,4090298,4090901,1,0,edwinnathaniel,,,"This is a very thorough, albeit not necessary accurate, story of one's experience using Java.<p>I agree that there are TONS of duplicated effort out there:<p>Tapestry, Struts 1/2, JSF, Wicket, etc are all ""MVC _and_ Component Oriented"".<p>Hibernate vs JPA (yes, I know Hibernate is JPA 2 compliant, and yes, I know JPA 2 has less features).<p>XML processors. Java common utilities, the list goes on.<p>But these days there seems to be a quite select few of winners in my book: Google Guava, JUnit (TestNG is neat, but JUnit is good enough for 80% cases), GWT, Spring Framework or Java EE6 (your choice, or mixed).<p>Java based ORMs can't beat dynamic language ORMs in terms of ""it's fun to use"" (or less setup). Period. But having said that, Java based ORMs took different approach compare to ActiveRecord or Django Model. Java based ORMs are more similar to Ruby DataMapper; they required a little bit of setups (have to define your own model, etc) but in the long run, I think these second concept (or known as the Data Mapper pattern: <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html</a>) may have been a better choice. Of course that is for the long run... not weekend project, get-prototype, get-funded, and get rich-quick scheme.<p>Java-based App Servers are heavy but with a caveat, depending on your loads, Java-based App Servers may use less resources (or degrade gracefully) because they are utilizing thread vs bringing up Rails + Ruby process per request.<p>When it comes to dev-time that depends on your experience. For example: I use JUnit, Eclipse, and JUnit plugin as faux-REPL. No re-compilation needed. Setting up the tools I mentioned is done via Maven + vanilla Eclipse. In another word: don't get too gung-ho with the number of tools I mentioned. It's fairly simple to get it to work.<p>I do have to say this though: as much as people hate Maven, there's no better and more complete build/dependency management/project management tools in other ecosystems (Ruby, Python, Lisp, Haskell) compare to Maven. None.<p>When it comes to IDE, I love the shortcut navigation keys of my IDE, Eclipse. I'm contemplating to purchase RubyMine in the future as well because quite frankly I can't live with VIM/Emacs. NetBeans has a decent Ruby IDE for a while until Oracle decided not to invest in Ruby anymore. Not sure what the stats these days. I need my ""press X to go to Class/Method definition"" to read the actual source code.<p>Yes, Java has been slow moving forward under SUN. Things have changed under Oracle. They're pushing it aggressively and toward the right direction.<p>People keep saying that the ""WAR"" deployment is one of the best thing that happened in Java. I heard Oracle is preparing Java EE7 that supports multi-tenant architecture.",1339397675

It is the same concept, but implementation is pretty clearly not Swype's (I've used both and, among other things, it isn't as good). Nevertheless, AFAIK, ASUS hasn't been sued over this, despite Swype's owner (Nuance) being known for a certain amount of litigiousness (see: Vlingo).<p>I suppose it is possible that ASUS licensed Swype's patent, but not their implementation, but that seems strange (how would the cost-benefit analysis on that work?).

If you don't get it because of a lack of business experience, go talk to your local high-school-educated baker, mechanic or gas-station owner for a quick round-down.</i><p>Talking to your local high-school-educated baker is not science.  We confidently believe a great deal of things that are untrue, and getting it confirmed with science is valuable. In hindsight, it's usually easy to be unsurprised by a scientific result.<p>Can you imagine possible circumstances that would lead you to confidently believe taxation and regulation to be the cause of many businesses' failure even if it were untrue?<p><i>The evidence is overwhelming. Yet, we keep dicking around and supporting policies, politicians and people who somehow think they can violate the laws of physics and make things better by shafting everyone with more taxes.</i><p>I would love to believe this, since that would be a good argument to have less taxes. However, as your only evidence, you offer an example of absurd property taxation on desks and chairs.<p>Such taxes cost a business in legal, accounting, and administration fees, in addition to the tax itself, and it costs tax money to operate the government bureau to oversee all of this. All this looks to be a blatant example of government inefficiency.<p>However, every country in the world, at least every democracy, suffers from such problems. At one point or another, the politicians have to trade political capital to push for the policies really important to them, their funders and their voter base, and less than ideal compromises do get made.<p>I believe that taxation is inherently inefficient and I would like to see as little of it as possible. And I also believe that some functions of government are useful to society at large. A balance must be struck. This balance will include inefficiencies that come with running a political society.<p>Given that a balance must be struck, it is possible that the optimal level of taxation would be higher than now.

Last year we managed to pay all the bills through an IndieGoGo campaign: <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/Bens-Friends-Builds-Support-Groups-for-Patients-With-Rare-Diseases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/Bens-Friends-Builds-Support-Groups-...</a> - we never dreamed Crowdfunding would exist, now it's our lifeblood. Reading through many of the responses below, they are public service projects. It's very likely you could do at least a small crowdfunding to pay the bills if you need it.<p>-Who cares if you don't make money? You get to do something you love. That makes you incredibly lucky. Also, almost every person here has tons of opportunities so you can make money on something else. Again, that makes you lucky.<p>-Change the way you measure success. Most people measure success with money. Since we weren't going to make any money on Ben's Friends, we started measuring how many thank you emails we received every day. I get about 25 thank you notes a day - completely unsolicited. Your measurement may be usage, or reach or whether your girlfriend likes your app. Whatever it is, focus on that. It will make you a lot happier than money.<p>-If you are going to do something that doesn't make a lot of money, do it with a partner. It will be more fun, you'll pick each other up when things are down, and with both of you brainstorming and iterating, there is a much better chance it will get traction and eventually become something. Ben's Friends never would have gone anywhere without my partner, Ben Munoz. Good partnerships turn into great friendships and they are one of the best things about starting something.<p>Hope this helps. thanks for posting a great question.",1339395901

You only have to run a business --any business-- for a few quarters to understand the negative impact that taxation and over-regulation can have on the decisions you make, the risks you take, your ability to compete and how quickly you can grow.<p>You really don't need a study from Harvard to get data on this.  If you don't get it because of a lack of business experience, go talk to your local high-school-educated baker, mechanic or gas-station owner for a quick round-down.<p>The evidence is overwhelming.  Yet, we keep dicking around and supporting policies, politicians and people who somehow think they can violate the laws of physics and make things better by shafting everyone with more taxes.<p>When are we going to learn and act? When it is too late?<p>I owned a manufacturing business for nearly a decade.  We designed and assembled electronics, embedded systems, FPGA's, lots of code.  Hell, we even had a full-blown CNC  shop with the latest equipment.  As an engineer it was fun to go to the office.  As a business person, it was painful.<p>Example: One day this guy from the County of Los Angeles Business Property Tax department shows up in our industrial area going from door to door.  The guy comes into our office and informs us that he was there to confirm how much we owned in business property taxes.  I told him that we leased the 10,000 square foot building.   We didn't own it.    He then says:  ""Do you own desks, computers, tools, machinery, fax machines, chairs...?"".  Sure.  ""Well, you have to pay the County of L.A. taxes on these and other items"".  The only thing that I could say to him was ""You have to be fucking joking!  I have to pay you taxes on my desks and chairs, forever? Why?""<p>Think I am making this up?

The supply chain is royally fucked.  A lot of what you have to source you just can't get in the US any more.  More an more suppliers are closing their doors every day.  It's painful, difficult and you are getting killed by product coming from China.<p>I won't go into the details that led to my decision to abandon hardware/electronics manufacturing.  I, ultimately, decided that it was a far better idea to transform into a software-only enterprise and move away from making real physical goods.<p>Because what we made involved everything from electronics, FPGA's, embedded, web and workstation software it really wasn't too difficult to shed the hardware portion of things and stick to software.  I pains me because I love making things, but we, in the US, have somehow managed to FUBAR our system to such an extent that people like me have to say ""fuck it"" and move on.<p>If you continue voting for policies that promote higher taxation and regulation, more government involvement and government programs you are going to get exactly the country you are voting for:  A third world mess with rats jumping ship faster than humans.

I just noticed that Firefox has used a similar pattern on its ""speed dial"" startup page in version 13. To make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, I opened up the image files in the GIMP,  zoomed in, and used a color picker. Sure enough, there is a somewhat random color variation throughout the patterns.<p>So the question is, why not use smooth backgrounds and gradients? Is there some sort of aesthetic advantage to the noise?<p>My dad, who worked in the automotive business, told me that the reason car manufactures put tiny swatches of many different colors on the upholstery of the seats is that it has the unexpected effect of being able to match many different exterior colors.

If you can't refine an idea, then this restricts innovation. If I can refine the idea and then patent it, does this mean that any license costs must go only to me?

Result: restriction of innovation and trade.<p>Option 2: You can refine a patent, but don't have have to license this to the original patent author. Result: you can bypass patents.

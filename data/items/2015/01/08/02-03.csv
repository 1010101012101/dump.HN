He&#x27;s not feeling for the factory worker in Detroit who is out of a job. He&#x27;s feeling for himself because when he strolls around the East Village, he&#x27;s sad that there aren&#x27;t bookstores. He&#x27;s sad because now everyone has a voice and his voice isn&#x27;t as loud or meaningful.

Cold Harbor may have had up to 7,000 in a matter of <i>minutes</i>.<p>At Gettysburg, Pickett&#x27;s division suffered around 60% casualties in their one charge, including a 100% casualty rate among regimental and brigade commanders, prompting his famous comment to Lee (on being told to prepare his division for a possible Union counterattack) &quot;General Lee, I have no division&quot;.<p>It was a relentlessly and almost unbelievably bloody conflict, and yet both sides found the will to keep it going for four years. What sticks out to me is Grant&#x27;s comment after the first day at Shiloh (which had been close to a massacre of the Union forces) in response to Sherman, who said to him &quot;Well, Grant, we&#x27;ve had the Devil&#x27;s own day, haven&#x27;t we?&quot; Grant simply said &quot;Yes.

Instead of being empowering and fulfilling … it turns into the opposite. In a sense, it&#x27;s Enlightenment&#x27;s Evil Twin. This is serious but still manageable through intensive … guidance under a competent teacher. In some cases, it takes months or even years to fully metabolize, but in my experience the results are almost always highly positive.<p>He goes on to add:<p>> If we don&#x27;t describe the possibility of Dark Night, then we leave people without a context should it occur. On the other hand, if we do discuss it, people get scared and assume it&#x27;s going to happen to them, even if we point out (as I just did), that it&#x27;s relatively infrequent. So the take-home message is:<p>> 1. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s probably not going to happen to you.<p>> 2. Even if it does, that&#x27;s not necessarily a problem.<p>The post is worth reading in its entirety.

It is not that you want to target basic cell structures, but you want to either target multiple systems, or target systems that have a large number of modular interactions. It is relatively easy to create/discover new chemicals that kill bacteria specifically, but if these new chemicals only target one specific component then the bacteria rapidly evolve resistance. All the good antibiotics we have interact with complex systems like ribosomes that are made up of multiple interacting modules.<p>The reason we are having trouble finding new classes of antibiotics is that we are already have chemicals that target most of the interacting and essential cellular modules in bacteria. If you already are targeting 90% of all the possible targets you will find it very hard to discover any new classes of antibiotics.<p>Of course the solution is not to worry too much about finding new classes and just keep tweaking the current antibiotics to keep ahead of the bacteria. The only problem with this strategy is that the economics of antibiotic development is totally broken so the pharmaceutical companies have in the main stopped spending money on finding new antibiotics. What we need to work on is a new way of paying for new antibiotic development.",1420685108

EFF is misrepresenting what the agreement says here, putting spin on it.<p>Please cite your sources for the part quoted above.  I have seen many reports of unjust rejections.  The ones that led me to believe Apple was being overly strict were those where I thought Apple&#x27;s rules were ridiculous.  I would hold the same opinion of the rules (and Apple) regardless of the app.  I don&#x27;t use, and therefore do not care, about any of the rejected apps themselves.<p>I disagree that jailbreaking (letting users have control of their own devices) is bad or in any way unjustified due to malware.<p>I disagree with your statement that the no tinkering clause has anything to do with malware.  How do you think that actually works?  The only way I can imagine is if malware authors, unabashed at the thought of breaking federal laws like the CFAA that can lead to long sentences in federal prison, were somehow cowed into submission by Apple&#x27;s mighty developer agreement and the torts that violating it might lead to.  While that thought is amusing, I hope you have a better reason I haven&#x27;t considered.<p>I do like Apple giving people encryption options and I think that governor is silly.  However, you are raising a side issue that has nothing to do with the claim made in the article.  The ability to &#x27;tinker&#x27; and discover how things work is critical both for security research and being able to independently fix issues if Apple cannot or will not.  You can find many researchers who had vendors ignore security defects for years (including that site recently posted to HN and their terrible API that leaked digits of people&#x27;s credit card numbers), so security-minded people have a very deep mistrust of anyone who refuses to allow them to investigate issues.<p>I don&#x27;t care why Apple can kill an app on my machine, the fact that they can do so unilaterally is inherently disagreeable.  I note that you do not dispute the fact of it, only the reasoning.  Contrast that with antivirus where I can, in fact, tell it to allow a virus, such as the EICAR test file, which I need to test that antivirus systems are working.<p>Your own characterizations are far more hyperbolic than anything the EFF said.",1420683108

Sometimes I even use it as a pleasantly-silent desktop, since it&#x27;s on the same stand that holds my monitor and keyboard/mouse.  Because it&#x27;s right here in the house, latency and bandwidth are great.  Because it consumes so little power (even with an external 2.5&quot; disk drive attached) I don&#x27;t worry about leaving it on all the time.  It&#x27;s just a good do-everything workhorse, that also happens to be small enough that I could toss it in a bag and take it on the road with me if I felt like it.",1420682773

8854635,comment,8853088,8853088,0,0,roberthahn,,,"Interesting article. Thanks for posting, varunsrin! I&#x27;ve been following development of SoundFocus for awhile.<p>I&#x27;m profoundly deaf. This is a technical term classifying the degree of hearing loss; to give you a sense of where this fits, the typical classification range is mild, moderate, severe, profound, total.<p>Between a combination of hearing aids and lip-reading, I&#x27;ve done a reasonable job of integrating into a hearing society. Not perfect, but ok.<p>I&#x27;ve often wished for a different approach to correcting hearing.  It crystallized for me after I read this article by Jon Udell: <a href=""http://blog.jonudell.net/2014/12/09/why-shouting-wont-help-you-talk-to-a-person-with-hearing-loss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jonudell.net/2014/12/09/why-shouting-wont-help-y...</a><p>In that article, what Jon found was that his mom would hear best if you spoke at a low to medium volume close to her ear - this worked better than any shouting at a greater distance could accomplish.<p>And it should be easy for you to simulate - get a friend to talk to you from 50&#x27; away - you can still hear them, but there&#x27;s some detail loss that wouldn&#x27;t happen if they&#x27;re 3&#x27; away.<p>I still benefit - a lot - from MBC, but if someone could come up with a way to make the incoming sound sound as if it were right beside me, man, that would really help me understand people clearly.<p>One non-technical solution, that people use to ensure that deaf people can understand you clearly is to enunciate consonants audibly. An example of this is is the word &quot;red&quot; - it becomes &quot;erREDdead&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a name for this so I can&#x27;t point you to a page describing how to extra-enunciate all the letters.  As useful as it is, people speaking to me like that always makes me feel like I&#x27;m dumb, because they sound dumb saying it.  Clearly I have issues :-)",1420682500

As much as I dislike the developer agreement, it has served the purpose of helping apple to control their devs and users, and has helped apple to make money.<p>Apple will end these policies when their financial health requires it.

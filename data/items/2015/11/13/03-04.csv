Having other people in the project use cabal install -- well, you can&#x27;t blame a tool for other people not using it. It&#x27;s true that nixpkgs doesn&#x27;t track multiple versions of packages, but using the existing tooling (cabal2nix) it should be possible to fix down the versions you need.<p>Towards the second point, nix isn&#x27;t meant to figure out what C libraries you need; it&#x27;s meant to let you specify exactly what those are and be confident that those will be respected.",1447387114

Are you harming others by investing other people&#x27;s money into oil companies or weapons manufacturers? Are you harming others if they expect you to make a certain return, and you fail to meet that? (More on that below)<p>> <i>and though they accept higher wages, they also create far more value</i><p>This is actually very, very debatable. While the finance industry is helpful and lubricates all other parts of the economy, it&#x27;s also rife with abuse. I worked at a financial software company for a while, and you would be blown away by the corruption, greed, and irresponsibility of that industry (among ratings agencies, bulge-bracket banks, and hedge funds). If the general public in the US knew about it, there would probably be mass panic.<p>Furthermore, a lot of finance involves wealth management, and there&#x27;s no evidence that wealth managers actually generate any value unless they&#x27;re actively, illegally gaming prices. I don&#x27;t have time to get sources right now, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to Google. Jon Stewart&#x27;s interview with Jim Cramer is very enlightening in that regard, since he admits to illegally gaming prices because all of the top-tier wealth managers have to do it.",1447386957

You enter the first room of the mansion and it&#x27;s completely dark. You stumble around bumping into the furniture, but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it&#x27;s all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into the next room and spend another six months in the dark.

It is typically easier to set these up as a sole proprietor because the personal liability works in your favor with regard to the bank.<p>2. Use separate credit cards for purchases, but to a first approximation don&#x27;t purchase anything for which you cannot invoice a client...i.e. you don&#x27;t need a new Macbook Pro and you definitely don&#x27;t need to spend time pretending that shopping for one is work.<p>3. Generally, if you &quot;incorporate&quot; an LLC is the way to go because you don&#x27;t necessarily have to pay yourself a salary (check with an accountant) and can just disperse money to yourself much like with a sole proprietorship.<p>4. Also check worker&#x27;s compensation laws in regard to sole-proprietorships, LLC&#x27;s, and S-corps. This is a place where I&#x27;ve seen people run into trouble.<p>5. General advice, contracts matter, but client relations matter more. You probably don&#x27;t want to lawyer up to enforce some term of your contract. You&#x27;re better off stopping work when you don&#x27;t get paid quickly and that means having prompt payment terms in your contracts.

However, you absolutely do own the device as it exists as hardware. You don&#x27;t own the software on it, but that&#x27;s the same for every proprietary software product in existence. What you own is a license to run the software for certain purposes. Whether or not this is a bad thing is for you to decide, but this is not a problem unique to iOS. Furthermore, if you write an app using your free copy of Xcode and put it on your iOS device, you absolutely own the copyright for that app.<p>Now, as for what is true in your comment, yes, you do have to pay $99 a year to distribute apps using the App Store. More than anything else, I believe this is why Apple could not allow this to continue. If this became a trend among iOS app developers, it stands to reason that they would lose a lot of money from developers distributing this way instead of using the App Store. Yes, f.lux is free, but they don&#x27;t want a trend starting and even with free apps you can still sell advertisements. Again, I&#x27;m making no judgment on whether or not it&#x27;s morally just for Apple to do this, I&#x27;m just explaining why it happened in more specific terms. Second, doing this completely subverts Apple&#x27;s security features. The ability for users to load arbitrary apps onto their devices was to allow people without $99 to run apps that they made on their own devices.<p>This was a privilege originally only afforded to registered developers, and this was intended to lower the barrier to entry for iOS app development. When it&#x27;s one person writing apps for fun and loading them on their phone to test and show their friends or whatever, the security risk is low. When it&#x27;s groups of programmers telling people to download a precompiled binary that can&#x27;t be inspected to ensure its safety and load it onto their devices, it becomes a massive security risk. (as a free software person, you should know that even for us that chose to load it, we don&#x27;t know what the fuck it contains. f.lux is not open source. for all we know, we just loaded a ton of malware onto our iOS devices.)<p>It should be noted that there are shit tons of open source iOS apps, and <i>so far</i> Apple has not told them to stop providing the source for people to download, compile, and sideload.<p><a href=""https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps</a><p>There are so many reasons aside from locking down iOS that Apple could have locked this down for. You can&#x27;t read the source, it&#x27;s a proprietary app, it subverts their developer agreement, and it&#x27;s actively encouraging people (176,000 by their count) to load a binary onto their phone the source of which they can&#x27;t read and that by the developer&#x27;s own admission is using undocumented APIs.<p>Now, if Apple said that you were no longer allowed to load apps onto your devices without a developer license period, as used to be the case, then that would be a different story and saddening to boot. However, as it stands, f.lux is the only app I know of that this has happened to and there is ample reason for it having happened.",1447385936

A fourth-grade teacher exists more to make a principal look good for advancement to superintendent than for endowing society with the value of educated children. The fourth grade teacher has to put up with arbitrary state standards, political fighting between staff, inappropriate parental involvement, turning the other way on some issues they feel strongly they should not turn the other way on. It&#x27;s a political shitstorm like anything else, where a few people on top of something (no matter how small scale that something may seem by comparison to a huge bank) are applying pressure to make the teacher&#x27;s job more about subservience and fealty than about efficacious results.<p>I think that problems get worse and worse as you go up the academic and research food chain. You might be able to make an argument that being a pre-school teacher in a small rural town, or the pastor of a small community&#x27;s church (modulo one&#x27;s beliefs about whether promoting religious faith can ever be morally or ethically good), are actually &quot;ethical&quot; jobs, but I&#x27;m not totally sold that you can, and I don&#x27;t believe much beyond this can even enter the discussion.<p>It&#x27;s not so much about whether you overtly participate in something wrong. It&#x27;s about whether the aggregation of all the tiny little microscopic job duties you do to comply with bureaucratic hierarchy ends up summing up to unfair gains mediated towards someone who doesn&#x27;t economically deserve them, or that the gains end up being wasted.",1447385361

I mean only to show a piece of technology that more directly relates to the comments others have made.<p>That being said, Microsoft has developed a piece of technology called PhotoDNA[0], which is designed with the specific purpose of identifying child pornography. This is actively used on OneDrive and Bing, among other services - including Facebook. It&#x27;s safe to say that OneDrive does not just delete the content if child pornography is detected - it reports to the authorities. Now, it&#x27;s hard to argue that they don&#x27;t have a right to do that, as long as the person is voluntarily using their services. That&#x27;s where I draw a distinction here: Facebook could elect to turn on PhotoDNA on photos uploaded to their new service, and not properly educate their customers that stuff is being uploaded automatically. This does, essentially, constitute a passive surveillance system. Mind you, if it is used to establish that child pornography is found, you will have a hard time convincing most people that it is overstepping what Facebook should do. That&#x27;s my concern - that this will be pushed as a &quot;for the children&quot; thing, and then extended to &quot;to cut down on crime&quot; later, once everyone stops caring about its existence.<p>That said, that&#x27;s my concern. It&#x27;s not necessarily what I think will happen. I have no reason as of yet to believe that it&#x27;s the next step.

With\n    respect to the particular application, we have confirmed\n    that natural human kinematics convey necessary informa-\n    tion about person identity and therefore can be useful for\n    user authentication on mobile devices. The obtained results\n    look particularly promising, given the fact that the system is\n    completely non-intrusive and non-cooperative,i.e. does not\n    require any effort from the user’s side.\n\n    Non-standard weak biometrics are particularly interest-\n    ing for providing the context in, for example, face recog-\n    nition or speaker verification scenarios.
